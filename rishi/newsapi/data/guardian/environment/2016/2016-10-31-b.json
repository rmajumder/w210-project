At the time, 60 Minutes\u2019 story was so scandalous that, although it was largely right, the authenticity of key documents was questioned, and producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett as a fierce woman pushed to the edge of self-doubt) and anchor Dan Rathers lost their jobs.</p> <p>With Robert Redford cast as Rathers, the shadow of journo classic All the President\u2019s Men looms tall over Truth. Though Truth doesn\u2019t reach those heights, it\u2019s a pretty good iteration of the genre, wrapping you up in the ethos of table-slamming self-righteousness, just as a good journo movie should. And from the mad vantage point of the US election campaign, it\u2019s fascinating to see the disgracing of Mapes and Rathers as part of a broader political witch-hunt in what we thought at the time were the USA\u2019s gloomiest days. </p> <p>Truth is like a devoted fan\u2019s love letter to the great newsroom dramas that preceded it, and an enjoyable and smart film for a night in. </p> <p><strong>Film: Alice (1990, US), director Woody Allen \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOsWXU06c8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFOsWXU06c8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us. That\u2019s what has happened to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Woody Allen\u2019s latest, Cafe Society, is in theatres, but his magical, odd film from 1990 makes for far less masochistic viewing: it\u2019s Woody in a good mood. </p> <p>With her wide, anxious face and hurried eyes, Mia Farrow\u2019s heroine is a Woody stand-in: a Manhattanite whose existential dissatisfactions coalesce into a longing for an affair with a divorced musician called Joe. Alice\u2019s treatments from a Chinese doctor (please turn your Hollywood-racism filters to HD) supernaturally switch off her inhibitions. </p> <p>There are two lovely observations at the heart of Alice: the first is that there is a particular type of person for whom infidelity is actually incredibly difficult, even when they desire it; and the second is that all types of people have ways of insisting on unhappiness via increasingly elaborate forms of self-sabotage. On the surface, Alice has everything she should want (wealth, a husband, lovely children); as a character, she also has the compassion of her film-maker \u2013 an unusual thing to treasure in an Woody Allen film.</p> <p><strong>Film: Volcano (Ixcanul) (2015, Guatemala/France), dir.

Our Mayan heroine Mar\u00eda is set for a local arranged marriage, but yearns to run away with another man, Pepe, for a new life in the United States. She is torn: \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d in the US, she asks Pepe. \u201cMoney. Dollars,\u201d he replies while the camera remains on Mar\u00eda\u2019s face. \u201cWhat does the air smell like there?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know. \u201cHere, the air smells of coffee. And of the volcano.\u201d </p> <p>The really special thing about Volcano is its palpable creation of this remote place, with clean cinematography that captures life in the plantation in long, wide, unmoving shots. Through that honest film-making approach, debut writer-director Jayro Bustamante lets the story unfold like a fable, and makes Volcano a lovely, living eulogy to a culture that may soon be lost. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/23/frackmans-accidental-activist-theres-blood-in-the-water-and-im-the-shark\">Frackman</a> (film, 5 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/06/nightcrawler-review-jake-gyllenhaal-toronto-film-festival\">Nightcrawler</a> (film, 18 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/what-we-do-in-shadows-review\">What We Do In the Shadows</a> (film, 25 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/19/20000-days-on-earth-review-nick-cave-artistic-legacy-documentary\">Nick Cave: 20,000 Days on Earth</a> (film, 27 November), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/26/no-activity-patrick-brammall-and-darren-gilshenan-deliver-australian-farce-at-its-finest\">No Activity</a> (TV, season one, out now)</p> <h2>Netflix Australia</h2> <p><strong>TV: Black Mirror, season three (2016, UK), created by Charlie Brooker \u2013 out now</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvvMdJUz3rc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rvvMdJUz3rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/21/black-mirror-review-charlie-brooker-nightmare-sterile-world-is-only-five-minutes-away\">Black Mirror review \u2013 this nightmare sterile world is only five minutes away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no cure for the internet. It\u2019ll never go away.\u201d It\u2019s always been pessimistic, but episode three of Black Mirror\u2019s new season delivers the dystopian drama\u2019s thematic mandate in two brutal sentences.</p> <p>Now a Netflix Original, the latest Black Mirror instalments continue the template set early in the series: each hour-long episode is a self-contained, speculative science-fiction about one element of technology gone rogue \u2013 episode one, for instance, shows a Pinterest-y pastel world in which every person is reduced to a numerical rating via a social media app \u2013 with a twist in the final moments that usually sends the protagonist to madness, social expulsion or death. </p> <p>The difference now is that showrunner Charlie Brooker\u2019s bleak outlook is increasingly expressed in classical horror conventions, most notably in episode two\u2019s haunted house concept. Black Mirror is not always subtle and never light viewing, but it remains anchored in beautifully observed truths about how tech amplifies existing anxieties and unhappinesses.</p> <p><strong>TV: The Crown, season one (UK/US, 2016), created by Peter Morgan \u2013 4 November</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTfo44bGXdg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qTfo44bGXdg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Netflix\u2019s entry into British longform storytelling and the company\u2019s most expensive production to date, The Crown is indeed a must-watch \u2013 but not for the reasons you might think. </p> <p>Based on a viewing of the first two episodes, Netflix has applied the sensibility of prestige UK film-making to television production: Stephen Daldry (The Reader, Billy Elliot) directs a script from Peter Morgan (The Queen) presenting an origin myth of Queen Elizabeth II, beginning with the decline of King George VI\u2019s health in late 1940s and newlywed Elizabeth\u2019s premature ascent to throne. </p> <p>With its original programming, Netflix\u2019s genius may be its ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist of each country: where House of Cards is a melodramatic thriller that undermines US political institutions, The Crown is an immaculately-art-directed propaganda biopic aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/27/the-crown-writer-peter-morgan-ducked-chance-to-meet-queen\">humanising those in the monarchy</a> and positioning the Queen as a kind of proto-feminist. </p> <p>Mmmmm, politically dubious addictive longform prestige trash.

And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well.

He linked the vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> to a more general rise in anxiety among people over how economies have evolved and the \u201clopsided\u201d nature of gains.</p> <p>With just over a week to go to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US presidential election</a> and against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">the backdrop of a tight race</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Lew told an audience in Oxford that populism was on the rise in many countries, calling it \u201ca challenge in so many parts of the world right now\u201d.</p> <p>Lew told the Oxford Union debating society: \u201cClearly it was an issue during the vote here and the decision whether or not to remain part of the European Union. It\u2019s clearly a part of the elections taking place in the United States this year. And if you look around in Europe, it\u2019s part of elections in so many countries in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said people\u2019s worries about their economic situation and economic prospects stemmed from many sources, including technological changes and globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cIn the United States \u2013 and I would hazard to say that this is true here in the vote for Brexit \u2013 there is some anxiety that flows from the way that the modern economy has evolved that is looking for a solution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t people feel good? They are looking at an economy that increasingly seems lopsided,\u201d he added, saying many workers who paid tax felt wronged by what they saw as a business tax system where \u201con the international side you see a whole lot of international firms organising themselves to avoid paying in some cases any taxes\u201d. </p> <p>The onus was on government to reform the tax system, to increase investment in people so that they have the right education and skills for the modern workplace and to spend on infrastructure, according to Lew, who has served as Treasury secretary under the US president, Barack Obama, since 2013 after a stint as White House chief of staff.</p> <p>Without such moves, he predicted drastic long-term consequences. \u201cWe run the real risk that middle class, working class people say, \u2018I see the economy is growing but I don\u2019t see how I am going to benefit from it.\u2019 The danger, if that is where things drift to, is not just a short-term political one, I actually think it\u2019s a fundamental threat to liberal democracy and to free-market capitalism.\u201d</p> <p>Without referring specifically to Trump and his proposal to build a wall between the US and Mexico, Lew also addressed rising concerns among voters over immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a history [in the US] of \u2018everyone should have an opportunity\u2019, and you look at the way the modern economy has evolved and people are beginning to question that proposition. </p> <p>\u201cWhen people question that proposition they lash out and historically one of the places people lash out is against outsiders. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise to see that when people are anxious they lash out on issues like immigration.

Barriers, on the other hand, hindered economic growth, he added, in another apparent dig at Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.</p> <p>Lew also congratulated himself and his administration for progress made on shoring up financial stability since the global crisis. </p> <p>He said conversations with big banks in the week after the Brexit vote showed him that moves to build up capital and readiness to deal with shocks was paying dividends.

  "<p>Almost exactly 499 years ago, when he fastened his 95 theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, Martin Luther set in motion the cascade of argument, then formal schism, war and revolution that we know as the Reformation. Latin Christianity had been the language in which Europe talked to itself for the preceding 1,000 years. Now it was to become the language in which Europe fought with itself. The consequence was the modern world. The savage religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries gave birth to the nation state. The vernacular bibles of the Reformation shaped and fixed the languages in which they were printed. The struggles of European nations became global and their empires spread Christianity around the world.</p> <p>And now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/reformation-luther-pope-francis-catholics\" title=\"\">the European centuries are over</a>. An Argentinian Jesuit pope is visiting a female archbishop who heads the Lutheran Church of Sweden, one of the most secularised countries in the most secularised continent in the world. This would have been almost unimaginable half a century ago. The Reformation is finally over in Europe, not because either side has won, but because both&#xa0;sides have been overcome with exhaustion and brushed to the margins of history by their apparent irrelevance.</p> <p>Churchgoing is collapsing; the proposed EU constitution of 2005 chose not to acknowledge that Europe had Christian roots, let alone suggest that it might have a Christian present or future. For 500 years, Christians, when <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/f/foxe/martyrs/home.html\" title=\"\">they wished to be frightened</a> by the thought of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Clitherow\" title=\"\">a truly dangerous</a> and contagiously misleading religion, would think of the churches on the other side of the Reformation divide. Now they are more likely to be frightened and repelled by Islam.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Christianity remains a global force. There are more than two billion Christians. In large parts of Africa and Latin America, where the state has failed or is failing, organised Christianity remains as important as it was in Europe 500 years ago. Pope Francis is the head of the largest healthcare organisation in the world, and possibly the largest educational organisation too. Even in the western world there are still many places where traditional Christianity is morally and politically important. Poland is governed by a strongly Catholic, populist and nationalist party. Orthodox Christianity lends a heroic cast to the squalid crimes of Vladimir Putin. The votes of white evangelicals may yet give Donald Trump the presidency. All over Europe, the word Christianity is once more waved as a crusading banner.</p> <p>Yet the revulsion that we feel against those forms of Christianity itself derives from Christian thought and practice. The welfare states, which seem to have replaced the social functions of Christianity, had deep and often explicit Christian roots, as do the ideals of secular democracy. You need only look at Greek or Roman attitudes to slavery, genocide, or even infanticide to realise what a revolution Christianity brought into the world, and how this change has shaped modern, secular Europe.</p> <p>The great question confronting Europe now is whether the values of liberal democracy can sustain themselves. Through the fat years when religion faded it seemed that an appeal to reason and self-interest was enough. In&#xa0;the age of Trump, of Brexit, and the Polish Law and Justice party it is obvious that it is not. Emotion and imagination are needed too, and these are the qualities that make up spirituality. Without a belief that human rights are a way of talking about objective reality, and that morality \u2013 however disputed \u2013 is a matter of fact and not of preference, the web of trust and decency that holds our societies together could be ripped to shreds.</p> <p>We can\u2019t go back. The old model of state churches is dead or dying everywhere today. But something must replace it soon, or we may find that the French novelist Andr\u00e9 Malraux (who fought against the Catholic side in the Spanish civil war) was right when he predicted that this century would be religious \u2013 or it would not be at all.</p>",

Clark replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to me why would you not aim as a matter of negotiation to avoid bureaucratic impediments. That seems to me common sense. And this is what I set out.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Herbert</strong>, another pro-remain Tory, later put the same point to Clark. Clark replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I was able to say is how you would go into a negotiation. That seems to me to find common ground.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Clark suggested that the government could seek different trading arrangements with the EU for different sectors of the economy. </strong>He also implied there was a regional element to this.<strong> </strong>In response to a question from the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, <strong>Iain Wright,</strong> Clark said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to that the the approach - not only that I intend to take, but that I am already taking - with the firms that are in our economy is to take time to meet them to understand the different needs of different sectors, so that we can be informed by them, as we form our negotiating mandate. It will be different from sector to sector. That\u2019s obviously the case. </p> <p>My commitment, which we will share when we meet in his committee, is through our industrial strategy to make sure that we not only have confidence for individual sectors, but individual places as well. Because there is a very interesting confluence there, and I think the investment in Nissan is good for the sector, and good for Sunderland and the North East.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, later put it to Clark that his reply to Wright implied some sectors of the economy might be offered tariff-free trade with the EU while others would not. Clark did not deny this, but just said it was not in his power to decide the outcome of the talks.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Clark gave details of the four assurances he offered to Nissan. </strong>(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/31/nhs-spending-will-fall-on-a-per-head-basis-before-2020-says-health-committee-chair-politics-live?page=with:block-5817886de4b01c528432eb1f#block-5817886de4b01c528432eb1f\"> 6.10pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed there was no need for him to publish the letter he wrote to the firm about the support the government was offering. </strong>(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/31/nhs-spending-will-fall-on-a-per-head-basis-before-2020-says-health-committee-chair-politics-live?page=with:block-58177e52e4b01c528432eaef#block-58177e52e4b01c528432eaef\"> 5.29pm.)</a></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:57:16.693Z\">at 6.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58178a12e4b0219a00d3ab39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:16:01.438Z\">6.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clark statement is over.

He told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Through many conversations I, and my colleagues had, here and in Japan, it became clear that four reassurances were important to securing the investment for Britain.</p> <p>Three were about the automotive sector generally and one was about Brexit.</p> <p>These were</p> <p>1 - That we would continue our successful and longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, including Nissan.</p> <p>This support is available to firms for skills and training of the local workforce, for research and development and innovation \u2013 in line with EU and UK government rules.</p> <p>Since 2010 the government has invested \u00a3400m into the UK automotive sector in this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the coming years.</p> <p>All proposals of course \u2013 from any company \u2013 must be underpinned by strong business cases and tested against published eligibility criteria. All proposals are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the Independent Industrial Development Advisory Board and are reported on to parliament.</p> <p>2 - We would continue our work with the automotive sector, including Nissan at Sunderland, to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the UK, and in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites. In a previous post I established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with Local Enterprise Partnerships, have provided a way in which local councils, businesses and the government can upgrade the sites, especially sites brought into use from dereliction, and to provide the infrastructure for small and medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies. This programme I can confirm will continue and with vigour</p> <p>3 - We would maintain a strong commitment to research and development and in particular to the take-up of ultra-low emission vehicles. The opportunities presented by bringing the energy and climate change department together with the business department make us ideally placed to build on Britain\u2019s strengths in low carbon energy, the automotive sector, in science and research and many other areas</p> <p>4 - In our negotiations to leave the EU we will emphasise the very strong common ground there is especially in the automotive sector between ourselves and other EU member states in ensuring that trade between us can be free and unencumbered by impediments.</p> <p>A good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for other member states, and that is how we will approach the negotiations. Whatever the outcome we are determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58178800e4b08d944ba4cb48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:06:26.903Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the Commons <strong>Greg Clark</strong> says that the Brexit talks have not started, but that the demeanour the government should adopt should be to seek common ground and common interests with EU partners.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58178707e4b0219a00d3ab23\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:05:42.254Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mark Carney to stay on as Bank of England governor until 2019</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning away from Greg Clark for a moment, it has just been announced that Mark Carney will stay on as governor of the Bank of England until 2019.

Clark has not published the letter the government gave to Nissan that helped secure the investment, but he spoke about the assurances in some detail yesterday in an interview that shed considerable light on how the government will approach Brexit.</p> <p>Over the summer, and at the Conservative conference, Theresa May suggested that her Brexit priority would be getting control of immigration, even if that meant limiting access to the single market. Clark\u2019s comments yesterday suggested that in recent weeks there may have been something of a rethink, because<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\"> he implied Downing Street want a free trade relationship similar to the single market and customs union.</a></p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview has already prompted much analysis.

This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says policing has changed \u201cfundamentally\u201d since 1994, and she implies this makes it very unlikely that the Orgreave events could happen again.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have been very significant changes in the oversight of policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.</p> <p>The operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.</p> <p>Protections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction in the mid-80s of the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.</p> <p>The creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police \u2013 conducted prosecutions.</p> <p>With regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.</p> <p>Lastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says she is not convinced that a proper investigation into Orgreave at the time would have prevented the Hillsborough tragedy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The campaigners say that had the consequences of the events at Orgreave been addressed properly at the time, the tragic events at Hillsborough would never have happened five years later.

He said he feared that could amount to an \u201cestablishment stitch-up\u201d. He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The point I have made in response to that is that\u2019s precisely what the Hillsborough families were offered in 1998. That was an establishment stitch-up, and that led to the Hillsborough cover-up lasting another decade. So if that is the announcement then that will fall short of what the campaign and others have been calling for.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said there were very strong parallels between the way South Yorkshire police behaved at Orgreave and the way they behaved at Hillsborough five years later.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we learn more about the injustices of the past, and the 1980s, we\u2019ve got to be prepared wherever the evidence takes us, however difficult that might be.

He was one of Nigel Farage\u2019s chief advisers in the run-up to the 2015 and was credited/blamed for encouraging Farage to adopt increasingly hard right positions, especially on immigration. When he announced his leadership bid he seemed an unlikely candidate, partly because of his age (30) but more because <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ukip-leadership-frontrunner-raheem-kassam-nicola-sturgeon-twitter-apology_uk_5813943de4b0672ea688ddc0\">his Twitter feed is littered with offensive comments that make Donald Trump sound diplomatic, </a>but he campaigned energetically, and was good at generating publicity. Given the internal dynamics of Ukip, his decision to withdraw from the contest may be more significant than it looks.</p> <p>Here are three takeaways from the announcement.</p> <p><strong>1 - Paul Nuttall is now even firmer favourite to win than he was.</strong> His main rival is Suzanne Evans, the party\u2019s former deputy chairwoman. Evans is a strong media performer but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/29/suzanne-evans-gaping-hole-in-british-politics-for-ukip\">as her interview with the Guardian at the weekend showed,</a> one many issues her views don\u2019t square with traditional Ukip thinking.

Kassam, a former aide to Nigel Farage who was running as the continuity Farage candidate, was always a relative outsider, and in a statement he says he is suspending his campaign because he has decided he cannot win.</p> <p>Paul Nuttall, the former deputy Ukip leader, was already the strong favourite, and Kassam\u2019s move means his chances of winning are now even higher.</p> <p>Here is his statement in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>As of today, I am formally suspending my campaign for UKIP leader.</strong></p> <p>After much consideration, I have decided not to pursue my campaign to be UKIP leader any further. This was a very difficult decision, and I want to thank everyone who supported me in the process.</p> <p>It is a decision I have not taken lightly, but following meetings this weekend I realised the path to victory is too narrow. <strong>I would encourage my supporters to back Peter Whittle, who I think would make a fantastic leader of the party.</strong></p> <p>On their own, the following issues would not have caused me to take this decision, but taken together, the following reasons created an impossible route forward for me: </p> <p><strong>1. The top of the party is treating this like a coronation:</strong> I am not satisfied about the integrity of the process, and having put a number of complaints in to the party chairman, I was disappointed that incidents whereby Members of the European Parliament are using party databases to effectively campaign against me \u2013 ostensibly against the rules \u2013 were not challenged.</p> <p><strong>2. Disgraceful treatment by the media: </strong>I am tough and I can take it, but when<em>Times</em> journalists show up at my elderly parents\u2019 house at dusk, intimidating them, I draw the line. Billy Kenber at the <em>Times</em> has a lot to answer for and I will be pursuing a harassment complaint further.</p> <p><strong>3. Fundraising:</strong> While we raised enough for our deposit, and got over 200 assentors to my nomination, we could not raise enough for this to be more than a digital campaign run from SW1, and to not feature at events all around the country would have made me a hypocrite, given how much I criticise the establishment for ignoring the country.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks I will be providing a statement of accounts for all my donors, and in-keeping with my money pledge on my website, I will be giving them the choice as to what happens with the remainder of the money they donated. I will suggest we either: donate to the Royal British Legion or Help for Heroes, donate to the party, donate to Peter Whittle\u2019s campaign. Those who want refunds are welcome to contact me.</p> <p>I wish the UK Independence Party and whoever its new leader is all the best in ensuring Brexit happens, and in the upcoming electoral tests next year. I remain commited to the causes of the UK Independence Party, but sadly, at this campaign, it was a bridge too far for us.</p> <p>I will be continuing at my job as Editor in Chief of Breitbart London, returning to the United States this week to cover the last leg of the presidential elections.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:59:30.064Z\">at 9.59am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58171022e4b0219a00d3a8b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:36:25.031Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NHS Providers,</strong> a group representing hospitals, has put out <a href=\"https://www.nhsproviders.org/news-blogs/news/time-has-come-for-a-new-financial-settlement-for-the-nhs-and-social-care\">a statement backing what the MPs from the health committee are saying. </a>This is from Chris Hopson, its chief executive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We share the health committee\u2019s concerns that short term pressures, combined with cuts to public health, social care and capital funding, risk overwhelming the NHS\u2019 ability to provide the quality of care we all want when funding increases significantly tail off from 2017/18 onwards.

She told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s only technically correct if you\u2019re looking at spending on NHS England and you add an extra year to the spending review and you also take account of the switch from other budgets that we would normally think of as health spending. So, for example, you can only arrive at the \u00a310bn by shifting money from public health budgets and from health education and training, and also by changing the date at which you calculate real terms increases. So, yes, you can see how they have arrived at the figure. But the real figure we feel should be quoted at \u00a34.5bn which is considerably less ... That\u2019s over the period of the spending review and that\u2019s the period that we usually talk about increases in spending. We wouldn\u2019t normally, say for other government departments, just add an extra year.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also rejected the claim that Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, has said that the government has given him what he wants. In fact, health spending is due to fall on a per head basis towards the end of this parliament, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Stevens] was very clear when he came before our committee during our inquiry that if you look at the middle years, next year and the year after, we are going to be seeing a far more constrained situation, and certainly not what he asked for. So, certainly, for 2018-19 we will be seeing a per capita fall in funding for the NHS at a time when our demographics [are changing], the increase in older people, a 21% increase in the number of people over 65 in the last decade up to 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a clip from Wollaston\u2019s interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;Government wrong on NHS spending&#39; - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahwollaston\">@sarahwollaston</a> says actual figure \u00a34.5bn rather than \u00a310bn they have claimed <a href=\"https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg\">https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BVT6qNe3F2\">pic.twitter.com/BVT6qNe3F2</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I will report more on this if the story moves on.</p> <p>Otherwise, it\u2019s a patchy day.

Huc notes that the company could potentially also use a variety of agricultural products.</p> <p>\u201cWe use corn sugar because it\u2019s plentiful,\u201d Huc said, noting that there are 30 wet mills in North America that currently produce it. \u201cApproximately 25bn pounds of corn sweetener are produced every year in North America and our needs are a tiny fraction of this production.\u201d</p> <p>BioAmber isn\u2019t the only company using yeast and sugar to replace fossil fuels. Bolt Threads, a California-based company, is developing sustainably produced high-performance fabrics that will challenge nylon, polyester and other petroleum-based fibers.</p> <p>For BoltThreads, the key is spider silk. Like BioAmber, the company uses a bioengineered yeast, but in its case, the microorganism is designed to mimic the silk-producing abilities of spiders. \u201cWe start with a cell that produces spider dragline \u2013 basically, the structural thread that spiders use to make their webs,\u201d CEO Dan Widmaier said. \u201cThen we adjust it to bring out different characteristics. In concept, adjustment is simple: it\u2019s simply a matter of understanding the mechanism.\u201d</p> <p>Having developed a yeast that produces the silk they want, Bolt Threads follows a process very similar to BioAmber\u2019s: they feed the yeast water, corn sugar and salt, then allow it to make the protein. Afterward, they purify the protein and extrude it, making thread.</p> <h2>Small footprints</h2> <p>In addition to avoiding the expensive fossil fuel extraction that lies at the heart of any petrochemical enterprise, BioAmber and Bolt Threads are also less energy intensive across the board. BioAmber\u2019s fermentation process occurs at a temperature slightly below that of the human body, and its evaporation temperature is also comparatively low. \u201cThe entire process occurs at temperatures below 167F and atmospheric pressure, so we don\u2019t have to waste a lot of energy on heating or creating pressure,\u201d Huc said.</p> <p>Bolt Threads is still developing its products, so it hasn\u2019t done a full energy analysis yet, but Widmaier is optimistic: \u201cOur back of the envelope calculations tell us that our process will be as good or better than silk or wool,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>As for byproducts, the fermentation processes that lie at the heart of both companies produce little beyond water and spent yeast. The spent yeast is pasteurized, producing an inert product that can be used to make fertilizer or animal feed. For the time being, however, both companies are sending it to anaerobic digesters, which use it as a feedstock to produce energy.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t use solvents or toxic chemicals, and we have no toxic byproducts or greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d Huc said, noting that companies that make succinic acid from fossil fuels produce over seven tons of carbon dioxide for every ton of succinic acid.</p> <p>The company\u2019s process is also very efficient. \u201cEach pound of sugar we consume produces close to one pound of succinic acid,\u201d Huc said. And, given the low cost of corn sugar, that translates to a significant saving over comparable fossil fuel products. At current corn prices, oil would have to be priced at $25 per barrel for parity. Given that oil is currently priced at just under $50 per barrel, BioAmber\u2019s cost advantage will likely continue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/06/green-chemistry-growth-25-birthday\">Plastic substitutes and other breakthroughs from 25 years of green chemistry</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>End of life</h2> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that BioAmber and Bolt Threads\u2019 products are without drawbacks. One of the biggest problems with petrochemical products like plastic is their inability to biodegrade. Plastics in the waste stream<a href=\"http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/01/31/what-happens-to-all-that-plastic/\"> pack landfills</a> and<a href=\"http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/01/26/our-oceans-a-plastic-soup/\"> litter the Pacific Ocean</a>.</p> <p>In this regard, plastics produced from BioAmber\u2019s succinic acid don\u2019t represent a significant improvement over conventional ones. In fact, Huc says, his yeast-derived succinic acid is identical to succinic acid, which means that plastic made from the two compounds is identical. \u201cIf the plastic in question is biodegradable, its biodegradability will be identical,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On the other hand, Bolt Threads hopes to offer a significant advantage over textiles produced from fossil fuels. \u201cGarments made from fossil fuels can be recycled, but roughly 90% still end up in the waste stream,\u201d Widmaier said. \u201cAnd, since they\u2019re not biodegradable, they stay there for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Research has borne this out:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\"> according to several studies</a>, up to 90% of the plastic debris that ends up in the ocean comes from non-biodegradable fibers released by man-made fabrics during washing. By comparison, Bolt Threads\u2019 fabrics are designed to biodegrade.</p> <p>Even with the waste stream concerns inherent in plastic, it\u2019s clear that BioAmber represents a significant advantage over fossil fuel products. The company\u2019s plant in Sarnia, Canada, which opened just over a year ago, is capable of producing 30,000 tons of succinic acid per year, making it the largest succinic acid plant in the world.</p> <p>Huc said it\u2019s currently operating at 40% capacity but is ramping up as it increases its sales. And, for companies looking to green their supply chains, its products are particularly attractive: even with their bio-based feedstocks, they cost the same as conventional succinic acid.</p> <p>Or, as Huc puts it: \u201cThe green is free.\u201d</p>",

If you really have to clean, you don\u2019t have much sentimentality about using lemon juice on your windows, or making your own beeswax polish.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the visitors at Audley End have researched their own family histories. Don Crouch, 58, a retired civil servant from St Albans, who is visiting with his wife and a friend, says: \u201cA lot of people look back at their ancestors and have more connection with downstairs than upstairs life. Even fairly wealthy middle-class people are not well heeled enough to relate to upstairs life.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Judith, has researched her family back to the 1780s and discovered her ancestors were drovers, labourers and sawyers. \u201cI do find the class thing very interesting. I come from working-class stock. Although I maybe have gone up a little bit in the world, this,\u201d she says, pointing to Mrs Crocombe, \u201cis more what I would have experienced if I had been around then.\u201d She works for the V&amp;A, but is admiring the fine porcelain pie dishes.</p> <p>Some historians, however, worry that though the reconstructions of servants\u2019 lives here and at other stately homes are well researched, they can mislead modern audiences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60a09a7d817eac38d2348ddd901b9164af405664\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60a09a7d817eac38d2348ddd901b9164af405664/223_869_4966_2979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hughes as Prince Albert in Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hughes as Prince Albert in Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-lucy-delap\">Dr Lucy Delap</a>, a Cambridge lecturer whose specialism is domestic service, says that in the great houses \u2013 be they the Buckingham Palace of ITV\u2019s Victoria or the real-life Audley End \u2013 the servants \u201cwere quite well paid, and their conditions were quite easy when compared to the majority of servants working in one- and two-person households. They didn\u2019t have a green baize door and time off in the afternoon, and didn\u2019t have rustic-looking wheelbarrows to move apples around in.\u201d</p> <p>Delap is a fan of Audley End and other heritage days where you can pick up the dolly or iron and feel the weight of a pre-electric domestic appliance, but too often people fail to realise how back-breaking the work was. \u201cBeing a servant was all about getting up early, working until midnight and getting chilblains,\u201d says Delap. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think of it in those terms, because of the likes of Downton and Victoria. These romantic depictions of domestic service really efface the idea that this is a site of precarious, exploitative labour.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Askew if, born a century earlier, she would prefer to have been a member of the domestic staff or one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Braybrooke\">Braybrookes, the aristocratic family who owned Audley End</a>. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019d be down here with what was really going on. I wouldn\u2019t like to be up there with people curtseying to me. I like this kind of life,\u201d she says.Some historians suggest below-stairs life is possibly back in fashion because it represents a golden era compared with today\u2019s uncertainties. Lethbridge says: \u201cIt is an age, seen through rose-tinted spectacles, when we imagine the classes mixed in a paternalistic, co-dependent pyramid. The leisured class were at the top, supported by the labour of those at the bottom, who were in turn looked after. Maybe there is something in that highly regulated certainty that is attractive to us now.\u201d</p> <p>Most people do not, of course, connect the domestic servants of Victoria or Downton with today\u2019s equivalent: the eastern European cleaner with no paid holidays, or the Deliveroo-rider handing over your evening meal. Or, for that matter, staff in large country houses \u2013 now often a hotel.</p> <p>The most famous of these is <a href=\"http://www.clivedenhouse.co.uk/\">Cliveden House</a>, the Italianate pile owned by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_family\">Astor family</a> and scene of legendary parties and the <a href=\"\">Profumo scandal</a>. It is now owned by the National Trust but leased to one of Britain\u2019s smartest hotels, which employs 150 staff to service the 48 rooms. If you book <a href=\"http://www.clivedenhouse.co.uk/stay-over/offers/the-butler-did-it/\">The Butler Did It break</a> \u2013 which starts at \u00a3350 per night, per person \u2013 you can enjoy a private tour with the house butler, 53-year-old Michael Chaloner.

This includes the amazing view from the roof, the Lady Astor suite (yours for \u00a31,200 a night) and the below-stairs area.</p> <p>Here, the historic bells used to summon staff are mere decoration.

When I first came here in the early 90s, people came here for their \u00a31,500 lunches, the fattest cigars, and the most expensive brandies.

Because it epitomises everything wonderful about Italy. Nowhere else has quite the same artistic and historical richness as the Italian peninsula. In towns up and down the country, layers of time intersect, and artistic treasures are part of everyday life. The basilica in Norcia was built over the reputed birthplace of Saint Benedict himself, who in the sixth century AD founded the abbey of Monte Cassino in southern Italy and wrote the Rule of St Benedict, the blueprint for western monasticism that sets out a code of practice for communities of celibate men or women living, working and praying together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76156dd2b809a6dceb2936a2d4219de3198defd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76156dd2b809a6dceb2936a2d4219de3198defd6/0_0_3028_3192/949.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Cassino, severely damaged during the second world war.\" width=\"949\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monte Cassino, severely damaged during the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ware/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monte Cassino <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/apr/04/johnezard\">was destroyed in the second world war</a>. Now, the basilica of San Benedetto has been smashed by nature. Is it OK to admit that I am sadder about such damage in Italy than anywhere else?</p> <p>Itay\u2019s cultural greatness defies its geological instability. From the cathedral of <a href=\"http://www.orvieto-italy.org/images/orvieto_italy.jpg\">Orvieto</a>, high above the Umbrian plain, to the narrow, steep streets of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena#/media/File%3A201105_Toscane_Sienne.jpg\">Siena</a>, this is a land of people who have built into the sides of hills, mountains and precipices. Wherever you go in the country you will find staircases up steep hills and churches clinging to cliffs.</p> <p>It\u2019s that organic sense of continuity and deep time that makes Italian towns and cities so captivating. You can picture medieval life here, can feel the presence of generation upon generation. So much life is embodied in Italy\u2019s stones. So many stories haunt every alley and cloister. It seems that churches like the basilica of St Benedict will never vanish.

Urban civilisation in this geologically turbulent region has always lived with risk. Pompeii and Herculaneum are preserved as archaeological wonders because they were buried by Vesuvius in AD79. People are still living on the slopes of Vesuvius, hoping that nothing will go wrong. In the town of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.naplesldm.com/pozzuoli.html\">Pozzuoli</a> on the edge of a huge volcanic area to the north of Naples, a section of the harbour is deserted after an earthquake here in 1983. But the sinister dead section of the town does not stop thousands of people filling up its fish restaurants on a Saturday night.</p> <p>What can you do when you live in ancient communities on top of geological faults or magma chambers? You can pray. In Florence, for instance, the church of Santissima Annunziata has a miraculous painting of the Annunciation that was once taken around the city walls in a procession whenever the city was in danger from war or natural disaster. It failed to work in 1966, when this treasure house of a city was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.florin.ms/1966flood.html\">devastated by flooding</a>.</p> <p>From Pompeii to Florence to Norcia, the people of Italy have lived with disaster for millennia. Out of that instability they created beauty. Any loss of that great human fabric is a loss for us all.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s self-inflicted wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the public-opinion needle toward Hillary Clinton, according to recent polls. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">may have changed a little</a> in the aftermath of the FBI\u2019s renewing of its email probe last week. But even so, the fears of many voters that a Donald Trump presidency might become a reality have abated. </p> <p>Those fears are not unfounded. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-assault-allegations-women-jill-harth\">failings as a candidate and a person</a> are manifest, and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected. That\u2019s especially true at the agency level, with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power. The wildcard aspect of his personality poses risks that can\u2019t be predicted, nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging initiatives.</p> <p>What has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the Republican nominee\u2019s outrageous behavior, bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate, however, is a critical examination of what a Clinton administration will mean for the nation. The FBI probe, information on tangled interests within the Clinton Foundation, evidence of influence peddling and Wikileaks revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic process, signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal level.</p> <p>The content of what has been revealed in these leaks, as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable conclusion: Hillary Clinton represents the entrenched interests of the status quo. Her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized US policies for several decades \u2013 at tremendous, almost incalculable cost both domestically and internationally.</p> <p>During the campaign, Clinton has engaged in the type of saber-rattling one expects of presidential candidates, especially Democrats who seek to counter the party\u2019s image as weak on defense. She has agitated against Russian President Putin on Ukraine and Syria, and reiterated her belief in \u201cthe responsibility to protect,\u201d the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years \u2013 even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere. A muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered US allies, yet Clinton supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of President Obama without a hint of irony.</p> <p>The ill-advised and tragic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to extract a heavy toll, and though opposition to those wars helped propel Barack Obama into office, the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the government\u2019s ongoing crusade, the so-called War on Terror. In reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the US has waged around the world, the deadly manifestations of the War on Terror have largely been met with silence or, depressingly, approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement. Sadly, Donald Trump\u2019s self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question Clinton\u2019s unabashed cheerleading for a continuation of these modified Cold-War strategies. </p> <p>Beyond the battlefield, Clinton\u2019s historical enthusiasm for \u201cfree\u201d but not fair trade \u2013 even while waffling on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">TPP</a> \u2013 gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served. In the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the world, the Obama administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements. As Secretary of State, Clinton had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so. Why would anyone expect her to change now? </p> <p>The inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">Green party</a>, which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down US military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home. </p> <p>This election is about far more than our collective distaste for a hyper-inflated ego, and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of Trump for the clear and present danger of Clinton\u2019s corporatist logic is no trade-off at all. <br><br></p>",

Police said the python, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/07/python-killed-brothers-kept-apartment\">which was being kept as a pet in the apartment</a>, had escaped its enclosure and slithered into the ventilation system.

Earlier this year Van Gogh\u2019s ear made global headlines after a researcher found proof that \u2013 contrary to some suggestions \u2013 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jul/12/vincent-van-gogh-truth-about-ear-exhibition-on-verge-of-insanity-amsterdam\" title=\"\">cut off his entire left ear in Arles on 23 December 1888, not just the lobe</a>. Further headlines followed when it was claimed he gave the severed ear not to a prostitute (as often said) but a maid.</p> <p>And now the art historian <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/van-gogh-chopped-off-his-own-ear-after-fearing-his-newly-engaged/\" title=\"\">Martin Bailey is arguing</a> that Van Gogh had just got the news that his brother Theo, who financially supported him, was to marry: in despair that he might lose Theo\u2019s help and no longer be able to work, he hacked off his ear.</p> <p>It is a plausible suggestion that does not really disprove any other interpretation \u2013 such as his worsening relationship with his friend Gauguin \u2013 or indeed explain why Van Gogh thought this was the right thing to do under the circumstances. Rather it adds to the psychological pressures that led to his emotional collapse and self-harm. One could even argue that he just didn\u2019t like Christmas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Van Gogh\u2019s ear has become Warholian.

It generates endless headlines and jokes without meaning anything to anyone. This is not the 1950s. Artists are not existential heroes and poets no longer howl. Instead, Van Gogh\u2019s ear has become Warholian. It is famous for being famous. We don\u2019t feel moved when we hear another theory about it. We just feel briefly curious.

  "<h2>1 | Think of environment and development as one sector</h2> <p>Sectoral thinking is partly what will hinder us from meeting the sustainable development goals. The question is not how these sectors can collaborate, but how they can become increasingly intertwined to reflect the joined-up nature of the goals. A good example is the transformation from marine governance to ecosystem governance that took place in some countries when fisheries and environment ministries were reformed. <em>Tim Daw, researcher \u2013 ecosystem services and poverty, <a href=\"http://www.stockholmresilience.org/\">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sthlmresilience\">@sthlmresilience</a></em></p> <h2>2 | Develop trust</h2> <p>Traditionally, we have often seen these two sectors as competing \u2013 with the notion that you had to sacrifice environmental quality for development. There has also been some scepticism from those within these two communities about the intentions or approaches of others. Economists have not always been welcomed in environmental circles and there is mistrust when it comes to issues that are important to so many. But we are seeing a more enlightened view.

A factory or mine may be designed to minimise environmental harm but unless someone is there to monitor emissions, standards might slip. This process of safeguarding and achieving the best development outcomes is set out in various documents (such as the African Development Bank\u2019s Safeguard Policy). The key is to ensure they are implemented during and after construction as, unfortunately, when these major projects are operational, development practitioners have little or no influence.

Maybe the environment and development sectors need to have opportunities to get together more often. <em>Sue Riddlestone</em></p> <h2>9 | Harness natural resources</h2> <p>Virunga National Park authorities have acknowledged that the four million people who live outside the park will not stop entering it to cut down trees (for charcoal), hunt wildlife and graze cattle. The Virunga Alliance has helped install three hydroelectric dams that generate electricity for villages outside the park. Children can now study and women can walk with greater safety at night, and businesses are arriving in the region. The project has begun to promote better relations between the park\u2019s rangers and the local people, while building peace, stability and hope in North Kivu province. By harnessing the natural power of the park, the authorities have made great inroads to protecting its exceptionally rich biodiversity. <em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10307636\">Alex Jones</a></em></p> <h2>10 | Promote context-specific technology </h2> <p>In the Maasai village where I live, we now have solar energy installed for lights and charging points, and a solar water pump means children have time to do homework and women can take literacy classes. We have switched to clean cook stoves, using cow dung as fuel, and are about to install proper waste treatment because the wind blows in plastics from across the Mara. We have done this at a village scale, which is now being repeated across the Maasai, while keeping all the cultural elements of pastoralism and a semi-nomadic life. The Maasai may live in a world of no money and little food, but it is a world where the best technology can help ensure the future of an important indigenous people. <em>Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist, UN environment programme, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNEP\">@UNEP</a></em> </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/01/benin-forest-food-security-nutrition\">Discovering the secrets of Benin\u2019s forests to improve nutrition</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>11 | Tie funding to joint development and environmental outcomes</strong></h2> <p>The environment and development sectors will need to build on the objectives of each other to attract critical funding. This will require them to rethink and expand their work, but will present the opportunity to leverage each other in developing a larger value proposition. We are working with The Nature Conservancy to develop an insurance product to protect reefs facing the damaging impacts of storms. While the traditional approach to reef protection has been to seek public or donor funding to support biodiversity, there is a big opportunity to increase funding to this critical natural infrastructure by layering in development objectives.

And so it began to spread.</p> <p>The first named victim was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/creepy-clown-sightings-craze-speads-britain\">17-year-old student Megan Bell</a>, who has a \u201clifelong fear of clowns\u201d and was chased down the street by one at night. Soon, more clowns began to pop up: in Wales, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool. Then just about everywhere. Concerned parents made Facebook pages about clowns, thus inadvertently helping to spread the meme. The Metropolitan police advised schoolchildren to call 999 if they saw a \u201ckiller clown\u201d. Some observers spoke knowingly of a classic \u201csocial panic\u201d, since only a very few of the clown incidents involved actual physical assaults. But being chased down the street at night by a clown, or anyone else, is frightening enough for adults and children alike. <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/mps-response-to-killer-clown-incidents-190479\">As Met commander Julian Bennett pointed out</a>: \u201cAntisocial behaviour can leave people feeling scared, anxious and intimidated, and I would urge those who are causing fear and alarm to carefully consider the impact their actions have on others.\u201d These stories were surreal news fodder, but not, when you thought about them, actually funny. But why clowns? And why now?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/05/clown-sightings-south-carolina-alabama\">Clown sightings: the day the craze began</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/05/clown-sightings-south-carolina-alabama\">The current craze started, as crazes often do, in the US</a>, where, since the beginning of August, people dressed as clowns had been popping up creepily all over the country. There was speculation that it was all a PR stunt for the upcoming release of a movie version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/23/why-stephen-kings-it-still-terrifies-30-years-on\">Stephen King\u2019s 1986 horror novel It</a>, which features a famously eerie clown called Pennywise. In fact, the earliest reported incident, a creepy clown standing in the street holding black balloons in Green Bay, Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2016/08/10/green-bays-creepy-clown-marketing-ploy/88527696/\">was a marketing ploy for a short film entitled Gags</a> produced by a local, Adam Krause. But subsequent clowns began to terrorise children and sometimes attack people, while commentators spoke of panic and hysteria. In Pennsylvania, a teenager was reported to have been murdered by someone in a clown mask. Police later said it was the victim who had the mask. Two weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37657072\">a clown stabbed a teenager in Varberg, Sweden</a>. There are, we are told, \u201ccreepy clowns\u201d or even \u201ckiller clowns\u201d everywhere. Last weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/30/creepy-clown-craze-nspcc-warning-vigilant-halloween-children\">the NSPCC said that Childline counsellors had received hundreds of calls from children worried about clowns.</a> People call it the great clown panic, or clown uprising, or clown invasion, or clown craze, of 2016. And so far it shows no sign of abating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"145bf102c1362fffaea21d1e86fe36959369fa56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/145bf102c1362fffaea21d1e86fe36959369fa56/0_63_2268_2835/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Curry as Pennywise in the 1990 TV film Stephen King\u2019s It.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Curry as Pennywise in the 1990 TV film Stephen King\u2019s It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lorimar Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clowns have never been straightforwardly funny. Connoisseurs of pulp fiction will cite King\u2019s Pennywise. Comics fans will think of Batman\u2019s antagonist, the Joker. Anti-corporate activists will probably point to Ronald McDonald. But the killer-clown meme is grounded in a far more sordid reality. David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, was lecturing on just this subject earlier in the summer, before the current wave of clown-related incidents. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a brand new module that I teach in the final year about serial murder,\u201d he says. \u201cI was showing the students some images of killer clowns. And the idea of a killer clown is all too real if you know <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy\">the history of John Wayne Gacy</a>.\u201d An American serial killer and rapist, Gacy was convicted of the murders of 33 boys and young men in Cook Country, Illinois between 1972 and 1978. He was also well known in his community as Pogo the Clown, performing at children\u2019s parties and fundraising events. As he was arrested, Gacy is reported to have said: \u201cYou know, clowns can get away with murder.\u201d</p> <p>The fear of clowns is known as coulrophobia. And it\u2019s understandable because, even if they are not serial killers, clowns are already creepy. \u201cIt\u2019s misleading to ask when clowns turned bad,\u201d warns the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/why-wouldnt-it-go-viral-clowns-are-unnerving-and-funny-at-the-same-time\">Benjamin Radford in his history, Bad Clowns</a>. \u201cThey were never really good.\u201d Radford cites Joseph Campbell\u2019s classic analysis of myth, The Hero With a Thousand Faces: \u201cUniversal too is the casting of the antagonist, the representative of evil, in the role of the clown. Devils \u2013 both the lusty thickheads and the sharp, clever deceivers \u2013 are always clowns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClowns deliberately exaggerate the human face and cover the human face with paint so as to make the face less human,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWhen a small child is first learning about the world, to have exaggerated features is incredibly disquieting. It makes them question what they are just beginning to feel is normal. Of course, the clown\u2019s behaviour is meant to be funny, but if you haven\u2019t yet developed that sense of the world then you simply view them as odd, scary.\u201d Even once we are old enough to understand what clowns are, their very point is to upset expectations. Clowns \u201cbehave in ways that transgress behavioural boundaries \u2013 they run up and throw water over you, for example, though of course it never turns out to be actual water; it\u2019s just paper. So the contemporary relevance of killer clowns through John Wayne Gacy taps into this broader cultural coulrophobia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5406bb683edeeaabc05255a0522d2cc5439e90d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5406bb683edeeaabc05255a0522d2cc5439e90d/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Videograb from CCTV from a car park in Kent shows a man dressed as a clown preparing for a prank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Videograb from CCTV from a car park in Kent shows a man dressed as a clown preparing for a prank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aaron Balick, a psychotherapist and author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking, suggests that the strong feelings about clowns we half-remember from childhood are contributing to the dual virality of the present phenomenon \u2013 the virality of the stories about clowns, and the virality of the idea that one might dress up as a clown to scare people. \u201cPsychologists understand \u2018contagion\u2019 to include the spreading of an idea, feeling or behaviour through a group,\u201d he explains. \u201cHistorically, you\u2019d see this in small clusters of people, villages and groups \u2013 think of the Salem witch trials \u2013 but social media enables a crowd mentality to be extended like never before. And the closer a contagious event comes to something psychologically or emotionally deep and/or universal, the more likely it is to trend.\u201d The scary-clown idea fits this pattern perfectly. \u201cThis volatile mix of intense feeling and contagion via social media spreads the idea of participating in an emotionally charged behaviour to such a large population that even if a tiny percentage of its viewers wish to mimic it, we\u2019re bound to see instances of it far and wide.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Pentland, a professor at MIT and the author of Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread, agrees. The clown phenomenon, he says, is in one way a \u201cstandard craze\u201d, such as planking before it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/16/planking-a-brief-history\">when people competed to lie face down in odd locations and post images and videos to the internet</a>. But because this new fad is also a \u201cdeeply buried cultural meme \u2013 kids are scared of clowns \u2013 it has additional virality compared to most\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/13/clowns-clown-craze-professionals-costume-sightings-phenomenon\">Professional clowns on the clown craze: \u2018They\u2019re in costume but they\u2019re not real clowns\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Add another factor: the charged vocabulary of news reports about the clown incidents. They are routinely referred to as \u201csightings\u201d \u2013 a word normally used when people claim to have seen ghosts or the Loch Ness monster, rather than blokes in costumes. On the day the first reports of clown shenanigans appeared in the mainstream UK media, the Mirror headlined one article: <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/schoolgirls-approached-two-creepy-clowns-8984338\">\u201cCreepy clowns approach girls walking to school in terrifying UK craze\u201d</a>. This was a telling variant on the article\u2019s first sentence, which read: \u201cTwo schoolgirls were approached by two creepy clowns yesterday as the terrifying American craze hits the UK.\u201d That this was already an \u201cAmerican craze\u201d was an accurate statement; but the headline\u2019s reference to a \u201cterrifying UK craze\u201d could hardly have been true, because only a handful of incidents had so far been reported. Does pre-emptive talk of a \u201ccraze\u201d become a self-fulfilling prophecy, helping to create a craze where there was none before?</p> <p>Any kind of mask, of course, is disquieting. Admirers of the movie Point Break will remember that the gang Keanu Reeves infiltrates is called the Ex-Presidents: they rob banks while wearing rubber masks of Reagan, Carter, Nixon and LBJ. They look almost like real faces, but not quite. This is well known in psychology as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uncanny-valley-why-we-find-human-like-robots-and-dolls-so-creepy-50268\">the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d effect</a>. As Tom Stafford, senior lecturer in psychology and cognitive science at the University of Sheffield, explains: \u201cThere is something especially disturbing about something which is nearly lifelike but isn\u2019t\u201d \u2013 such as a clown mask, or a painted clown face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4037484afc3b58263cfa37718298cb75c8a06869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4037484afc3b58263cfa37718298cb75c8a06869/0_88_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The masked robbers in Point Break.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The masked robbers in Point Break.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Five</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The obscuring of the face, moreover, is often perceived as a threat multiplier. Serial killers wear masks in slasher flicks such as the Friday the 13th or Scream series. And in the modern TV series Mr Robot, an Anonymous-inspired collective of hackers-cum-social-revolutionaries appear in public wearing what resemble Monopoly Man masks. (<a href=\"http://nerdist.com/the-origin-of-the-mr-robot-fsociety-mask-is-cheesy-horror-goodness/\">The mask in the show is in fact copied from a 1980s horror short, The Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie.</a>) \u201cUltimately we judge people by looking at their face,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cClowns disguise their face, and we \u2013 by and large rightly \u2013 distrust people who wear masks, because we don\u2019t know how to assess them.\u201d</p> <p>The creepy clown thus embodies wider cultural faultlines of the present day \u2013 consider, for example, the polemics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/19/battle-for-the-burqa\">(especially in France)</a> about women who wear the burqa and thereby keep their faces covered in public. Remember, too, that the clown is a grown man who tries to ingratiate himself with small children: some measure of subconscious paedophile anxiety is probably also in play. And the way the clown craze has spread to seemingly disconnected individuals who then act it out might also remind us of the global dynamics of what is called \u201cradicalisation\u201d via the internet. \u201cI doubt clowns know other clowns directly; they aren\u2019t copying their peers, but instead copying the media story about clowns,\u201d Stafford observes. \u201cSo the ideas seed among disparate individuals \u2013 a bit like with some seemingly lone-wolf terrorists.\u201d In which case, just as the media is at fault when it provides terrorists with precisely the publicity they crave for their acts of violence-as-PR, the media must accept some responsibility for the way in which a fun, weird story about clowns tipped over in some cases into actual violent assaults.</p> <p>What should you do if confronted by a clown? Just try to ignore them, Wilson advises. \u201cWhen you and I were growing up, we encountered people who behaved inappropriately \u2013 from exposing themselves to making inappropriate and lewd comments \u2013 and the best advice I was given was just to walk away, avoid them.\u201d Don\u2019t give the clown the fear-reaction he wants; but also don\u2019t challenge the clown. (The clown won\u2019t expect an aggressive response and might panic \u2013 possibly escalating, Wilson thinks, to physical violence.) Just walk away and report the incident to the police.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55a553280f9739d01da724e9aa62df26db76f33b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55a553280f9739d01da724e9aa62df26db76f33b/0_133_3986_2391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Revellers dressed as clowns in Cali, Colombia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revellers dressed as clowns in Cali, Colombia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An analogous strategy will probably work more broadly, in the media and on the internet. Which is to say: the clowns will only disappear when we get bored and start to ignore them. At the moment we\u2019re in a loop, as Stafford observes. \u201cThe media has an interest in reporting clowns; we the public like hearing scary stories about clowns; certain individuals pick up on the idea of being clowns. And on it goes.\u201d To send away the clowns we just need to stop giving them the attention they so desperately crave \u2013 in which case it must be acknowledged that this article is certainly not helping. \u201cIt will die out,\u201d Wilson predicts. \u201cIt\u2019s a phobia du jour.\u201d Maybe, after Halloween is over, peak clown will be behind us, and it will just fizzle out.<strong> </strong>Something else will become the new fad.</p> <p>But for the moment it\u2019s just such a good story that we can\u2019t help ourselves. The creepy-clown phenomenon is a compelling collaborative narrative \u2013 written by both the few actual clown marauders, and a public that is both titillated by a weird and scary story, and also existentially resigned to a news cycle in which the facts seem ever more ridiculous, and nothing seems less credible than anything else. After Brexit and a Trump presidential candidacy, after all, why shouldn\u2019t clowns be on the rampage, too?</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2016. An earlier version said a teenager in Pennsylvania was murdered by someone in a clown mask. That was initially reported, but police later said it was the victim who had the mask.</p>",

Reports said FBI investigators had known for weeks they might find pertinent emails on Abedin\u2019s device, which was shared with her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation over alleged illicit texts to a minor.

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got all sorts of ambitions,\u201d Sam Warburton says on an autumnal morning in Cardiff as the turning of the leaves and a creeping chill in the air concentrates his mind. These can be beautiful days, full of different colours and moods, but the changing seasons are also strangely warming. The looming heat of battle, with the autumn internationals starting on Saturday when Wales play Australia, inspires Warburton \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/wales-sam-warburton-british-irish-lions-captain-new-zealand\" title=\"\">the clear favourite to lead the Lions</a> in New Zealand next summer.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone sets goals and I\u2019ve probably got five left I still want to achieve,\u201d the 28-year-old Wales captain says. \u201cI would love to win a league title with Cardiff Blues \u2013 the club I\u2019ve always played for. I\u2019d also love to win another Six Nations [after Wales and Warburton won a grand slam in 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/16/wales-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">and the 2013 championship</a>] because I\u2019ve realised how hard it is. In the last three years we\u2019ve come so close but haven\u2019t managed another title. The 100-cap milestone is the next goal. I\u2019m on 67. That\u2019s something I will always chase. And then I\u2019d love to play in another World Cup and Lions tour. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to achieve all those things but when I come into training, I have thought: \u2018What are you really chasing?\u2019 I\u2019d love to do those five things before my career is over.\u201d</p> <p>A desire to achieve grand ambitions burns inside Warburton but he is also one of the nicest men in sport. He has been tempted to leave his home club and the often fractious Welsh game but it is significant that, in listing his five grand aims, Warburton should start with a local dream. \u201cI\u2019ve always said I\u2019d find it more rewarding to stay and battle it out to win one trophy with the Blues rather than go to a more successful club and perhaps win a few,\u201d Warburton says as he looks over the Arms Park, having just signed a new dual contract committing himself to club and country. \u201cI feel like I owe it to Cardiff because I\u2019ve been contracted here since I was 16. I\u2019ve been an employee 12 years \u2013 which is such a long time. So that would be really rewarding.\u201d</p> <p>Warburton\u2019s Blues bond is obvious but barring injury or an unexpected loss of form, it seems likely he will be Warren Gatland\u2019s choice to captain the Lions. Is Gatland keeping in close touch with him? \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t really spoken to Warren since we were in New Zealand [with Wales last summer]. We had a meeting as a squad before he was announced as Lions coach at the Vale hotel. It was a quick debrief of the tour for an hour \u2013 and then we went back to our regions and there\u2019s been no contact since then.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"991d4b1b5514e16f0e1fce5a8c3f6af328b9bebc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991d4b1b5514e16f0e1fce5a8c3f6af328b9bebc/0_297_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales and British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland with Sam Warburton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales and British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland with Sam Warburton during last year\u2019s Rugby World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wales played well in patches in New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/11/new-zealand-wales-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">and were ahead in the first Test</a> at half-time \u2013 and level on points <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jun/18/new-zealand-v-wales-second-test-live\" title=\"\">during the interval of the second Test</a>. They still lost the series 3-0 as New Zealand gathered momentum during the long run of victories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/22/bledisloe-cup-australia-vs-new-zealand-live-wallabies-action\" title=\"\">which culminated in a world record</a> when, two Saturdays ago, the All Blacks won their 18th consecutive Test.</p> <p>\u201cWe had good possession and territory and scored tries,\u201d Warburton remembers. \u201cThree in the second Test [and two in the first]. You can score tries against New Zealand but they have the best attack in the world by a considerable margin. In hindsight, there is some consolation other teams are finding them difficult to contain. I guess we can look back and think maybe our performances were better than we initially thought. They\u2019re playing tier-one nations away from home and they get to that hour mark \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Warburton shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what is going on. They just go up another gear. It was difficult this summer but we\u2019ve seen them do that against Australia, Argentina and South Africa.\u201d</p> <p>Can Warburton feel the increased power of New Zealand in the second half? \u201cIt\u2019s weird. Half-times have been really positive. You go out for the second half really confident you can kick on. But there will be a few mistakes and they\u2019ll score a try. Maybe those mistakes get made because you are fatigued and the transition from attack to defence is more difficult. New Zealand are the world\u2019s best counterattackers so you make two or three errors and the game\u2019s gone.</p> <p>\u201cI made one myself in the second Test. It was from a kick-off and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBtgQ8xLOj0?t=7m\" title=\"\">Aaron Smith threw a dummy and I bought it</a>. I\u2019ve never made that mistake before. They scored a try and I have to put my hand up for that one. It was an uncharacteristic mistake and the same&#xa0;thing happened to a couple of other players. Their bench had a fantastic impact as well. It\u2019s crazy to think how many good players New Zealand have got.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I find it easy to talk about the 2013 tour because you\u2019ve done it. With 2017 you don\u2019t want to jinx yourself.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Warburton approaches the likelihood of leading the Lions with sensible caution. \u201cAny Lions tour would be great,\u201d he says, \u201cbut after this one it\u2019s South Africa [in 2021]. I\u2019ll be 32 then and the Lions are going to the most physical rugby country in the world. I don\u2019t even know whether I\u2019m going to be playing international rugby at that age \u2013 never mind a Lions tour. So this [New Zealand] tour is the one. But it\u2019s difficult because you have no idea, when it comes to selection. You watch Sky Sports with everyone else in Britain to find out if you\u2019re in that squad. You haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d</p> <p>Surely the captain is always called by the head coach before the squad is announced? \u201cI presume the captain will get a phone call,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cThat happened to me in 2013 but the rest of the squad had to watch the telly. It\u2019s really difficult because you don\u2019t want to get your hopes up in case you don\u2019t get picked. So I\u2019m looking ahead and there is a Wales tour this summer to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. In my head I\u2019ve been thinking that would be an awesome tour. That\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming for and everything above that would be a bonus.\u201d</p> <p>There is a fascinating mix at work here. In the midst of counting off five lofty ambitions which would complete his legacy as a great rugby player, Warburton chooses to suggest his immediate objective is to make the Welsh tour of the Pacific Islands. I point out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/wales-sam-warburton-south-africa\" title=\"\">that the last time we met</a>, not long after he captained the Lions on their series-winning tour of Australia in 2013, he had admitted he was already looking ahead to New Zealand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c07192c674a8791fac4c94f44043843401fe7c06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c07192c674a8791fac4c94f44043843401fe7c06/0_13_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alun Wyn Jones and Sam Warburton after the Lions' 2013 series win over Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alun Wyn Jones, who captained the British and Irish Lions side for the series decider against Australia, celebrates victory with injured skipper Sam Warburton in Sydney in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI find it easy to talk about the 2013 tour because you\u2019ve done it,\u201d he admits. \u201cWith 2017 you don\u2019t want to jinx yourself. But 2013 was awesome and it\u2019s amazing when you\u2019re in the team huddle and you see that quality of player around you. It\u2019s an honour just to be in the same circle as those players. It\u2019s special because of that reason.\u201d</p> <p>Warburton\u2019s reluctance to talk about his probable role in New Zealand is understandable. Just as he needs to shun complacency, Warburton is wary of the way in which injury can derail even the most determined players. He has been on the sidelines after needing surgery to repair a fractured cheekbone he suffered on 1 October and will still not be fit to face Australia.</p> <p>A recent list of Warburton injuries suggests that, over the past nine years, he has endured 19 serious blows. But he now downplays their severity. \u201cSome of those have only been for a few weeks. But, yeah, I\u2019ve had five operations \u2013 a knee, both shoulders, two on my face. The knee was only two months and the facial ones have been weeks. The two shoulders have kept me out longest but I had nerve problems. There was also the hamstring, with the Lions [in 2013], which kept me out for a good three months. But some players have missed a whole season. God, I don\u2019t want this to happen to me \u2013 but say your ACL goes? You can write off nine months straight away. So I feel fortunate.\u201d</p> <p>His face still shows the wounds from his latest operation. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the odd battle scar,\u201d he says, thinking about his return to the pitch. \u201cThe next few weeks I\u2019ll probably have the old Mervyn Davies headband on just to protect it a little. So I\u2019ll rock<strong> </strong>a bit of a 70s look.\u201d</p> <p>In a possible homage to the great \u201cMerv the Swerve\u201d there has been talk that Warburton might switch from openside flanker to No8 to replace the injured Taulupe Faletau. \u201cI haven\u2019t had that conversation with anyone. I\u2019ve only heard that my name is apparently in discussions about No8. I don\u2019t know. I played there in the under-19s and under-20s and my first game for the Blues was at eighth-man. I don\u2019t know how I would fare now as I\u2019d be one of the smaller No8s in world rugby. You\u2019re looking at 108kg plus nowadays. So I\u2019d have to bring something different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd6e23a7ca803b6ca891aa6d1cdd75acf3ba396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd6e23a7ca803b6ca891aa6d1cdd75acf3ba396/0_175_4594_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Warburton at Cardiff Arms Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales have not beaten Australia in their previous 11 attempts and defeating the Wallabies is one box captain Sam Warburton would \u2018really like to tick\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warburton was once a reluctant leader, but he now relishes the fact that Rob Howley, who is in overall charge while Gatland devotes himself to the Lions, has already named him as Wales captain for next year\u2019s Six Nations. \u201cRob asked me and I said: \u2018Of course.\u2019 I\u2019ve always said my one concern about being named captain is that I never want to become complacent. I always want that fear of not being selected. But one thing about being in the back row it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re guaranteed to play 7. You\u2019ve still got to prove your worth.\u201d</p> <p>The last years of a rugby player\u2019s career are also difficult. How long does Warburton, who became a father for the first time last summer, expect to keep playing as he chases his remaining ambitions? \u201cYou\u2019re the first person to ask me that, which is strange because it\u2019s been going through my head. I\u2019ve always wondered. I\u2019d love to get to the 2019 World Cup. It would be amazing to play three World Cups. All the top players have that longevity and I admire everyone who manages to do that because you realise how hard it is to play international rugby that long.</p> <p>\u201cForm, injuries and competition with other players make it extremely difficult. But it\u2019s something I\u2019d love to emulate and I\u2019m working very hard towards it. That\u2019s one of the five big goals. After that 2019 crossroads who knows what I will do. But here\u2019s hoping I get to tick off most of them before we reach that point.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One of the most significant moments in my life came one afternoon about five months ago, when I was volunteering in an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. I was tidying the park as part of my duties when I came across a beautiful, solitary elephant with a badly deformed front leg. Concerned as to why she was alone and curious about her physical health, I asked a guide.</p> <p>Kabu was 26 years old, like me. She had been rescued about a year before but sadly never settled with a herd. She had been used for the illegal logging trade since infancy, pulling huge weights up and down steep mountain ravines. During one of these tortuous journeys, a log came loose, rolled into her and badly broke her leg. Forced to continue working, her injury never healed.

I was not prepared for what happened next; Kabu mirrored my movement and leant into me. As she moved in closer, I could feel her sheer strength against my body. This gave me a sense of safety and security, so I pressed against her further as if to hug her. Moving closer towards her head, I looked into her dark eyes for several moments, and rubbed the top of her trunk. As she looked back at me, I was amazed. Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust and give affection to a human.</p> <p>We were in the <a href=\"https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elephant Nature Park</a> (ENP), a 250-acre sanctuary for rescued Asian elephants like Kabu, founded by award-winning conservationist Lek Chailert (known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/the-elephants-they-will-not-let-her-go-meet-thailands-elephant-whisperer\" rel=\"nofollow\">elephant whisperer</a>\u201d).

The ancient tradition of capture and domestication not only raises welfare problems, it is also a strain on the dwindling wild stock. On top of this many, some Asian elephants are subjected to a centuries-old domestication ritual known as \u201cthe crush\u201d, which breaks the spirit of a baby elephant to make it submit to human control.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust a human</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/thai-elephant-attack-spotlight-abuses-animal-tourism\">Animal rights groups report</a> that some elephants in the south-east Asian tourism industry \u2013 whether being used for riding or appearing to calmly paint pictures in the street \u2013 have gone through some form of the crush.

They form new family bonds, and some even have calves. While it is still visible how much pain and suffering these animals have endured \u2013 some are blind and others are too emotionally unpredictable to interact with humans \u2013 most of the elephants are relaxed and enjoy their freedom. ENP largely raises money through sponsorship and tourism. Visitors can stay for one day, or volunteer for up to two weeks (as I did).</p> <p>And how had I ended up here? A few months earlier I had been sitting in therapy, wrestling with conflicting urges to harm myself or to help myself. After experiences of abuse in my childhood, I began self-harming before I was 13. At this particular moment I was wrestling with hallucinations and beliefs that by hurting myself the disturbing images would go away. This time, however, I realised there could be another solution. I needed to do something life-changing, something that would take me out of my own head and into the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t initially know where to go. But after some research I found the Elephant Nature Park. Being a vegan and animal advocate, I felt it had the right ethos. While both my therapist and my wife were encouraging, they did have some concerns. Would I be well enough to travel far away? Would I be able to stay safe if I encountered anything that triggered urges to self-harm? What if being in such an environment were disheartening as opposed to inspirational, as I hoped? Although I was giddy with excitement about my grand adventure, I had to admit that these were concerns I shared.</p> <p>It took an overnight train ride from Bangkok to reach Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand, near the border with Burma. On the first day, everyone met at the ENP office in Chiang Mai city centre for registration and transport to the sanctuary itself. Our minivans were equipped with DVDs about how not to get trodden on by an elephant, something which had fleetingly crossed my mind before but was now crystallised as a legitimate possibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b88e9d2e66fb4e9eda76f55bb30ff327b61319e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88e9d2e66fb4e9eda76f55bb30ff327b61319e8/0_134_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asian elephant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Upon arrival, 50 or so excitable individuals waited to be paired up with roommates and organised into our volunteering groups.

We each got into single file, passing along watermelons from the van to the many giant shelves that housed the elephant food.

I instantly knew that this was going to be a wonderful fortnight.</p> <p>The volunteering itself focuses on providing care for the elephants such as bathing, food preparation (I have seen enough watermelons to last a lifetime), and accompanying them to the vets. Volunteers also look after the park; scooping poop (there is a proper technique to this; shovel from the back of the pile, lift up from the centre) tidying shelters and planting trees. </p> <p>All of us as volunteers were incredibly touched to have the opportunity to stay here and look after the elephants. My group of new friends and I would come together each meal time with new stories and experiences to share, and certain times of day became graced with new importance: 3pm, time to help bathe the elephants; 4pm, feeding time opposite our own dinner table. It would be unrealistic to say that I did not experience intrusive thoughts or that my hallucinations stopped outright, but I felt no need to act upon them, and my happiness far outweighed any negative emotions. The routine and the socialising was important, but the fact that I was helping these amazing creatures was by far the most important factor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/indian-zip/giv-310757P5ysgFlayR1/\" data-alt=\"Range of Asian elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/indian-zip/giv-310757P5ysgFlayR1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Range of Asian elephants</a> </figure>  <p>I think being in such an environment was therapeutic for all.

Although I have had challenging moments, I have not self-harmed once since coming back and I am approaching a year free of self-harm altogether. Kabu continues to be a source of inspiration.

Universities need to bear in mind that a lot of people have some sort of non-British background, so I feel they should adapt their courses to try to reflect that. A lot of people aren\u2019t fully British and may want to do a course that helps them to find out more about their own culture. That\u2019s what university\u2019s supposed to be about. It\u2019s not just learning about a subject, but learning about yourself. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in social sciences and in the future I\u2019d like to be some sort of activist for Black Lives Matter, or something along those lines. So a degree that has some focus on racial discrimination is the main factor in deciding what course I want to do. It\u2019s been quite difficult to find courses, but I\u2019ve found some.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go to uni, I\u2019ve told myself that I want to be in a place that has quite a big black population. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to live in a place that doesn\u2019t have that. I\u2019d like to go somewhere where there are things that I\u2019m used to, like being able to go to the salon and have my hair done properly. Little things like that automatically make you feel a bit more comfortable.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities should be more representative, because I feel that would make people more comfortable. But it shocks me more that we don\u2019t have enough BME [black and minority ethnic] school teachers. Once you\u2019ve got to the point where you\u2019re university standard, you\u2019ve already got your role models put in place. You\u2019ve sorted yourself out enough not to really need a strong role model. But when you\u2019re in primary school and high school, that\u2019s when you need to have role models who are similar to you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60218afc3558791e005bfdecbaa415f19b6a0137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60218afc3558791e005bfdecbaa415f19b6a0137/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Kehinde Andrews, UK\u2019s first professor of black studies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Kehinde Andrews, UK\u2019s first professor of black studies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vimeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018White privilege dominates\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"acc447996b74007c00118b8411ae45269e8a191c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acc447996b74007c00118b8411ae45269e8a191c/0_1_667_667/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Kalwant Bhopal\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Kalwant Bhopal</strong><br><em>Professor of education and social justice at the University of Southampton</em></p> <p>\u201cUniversities are white spaces, in which whiteness \u2013 and white privilege \u2013 dominates. Our research shows, for example, that black and minority ethnic staff are very scared to make complaints about racism. And when they do, it\u2019s either dismissed as a \u2018clash of personalities\u2019, or it\u2019s seen as taking something out of context. So what happens is the victim becomes the villain and white identity is protected at all costs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that universities pride themselves on being very international. They always wave this flag: \u201cWe\u2019re very international; we\u2019re very inclusive.\u201d And that may well be the case (because the numbers of international students is very high), but the curriculum does not address that internationalisation. The curriculum that\u2019s presented is very eurocentric. These are worrying times for universities: we say we live in a global society, but if you walk into any university and see who is on that senior management team, it\u2019s predominantly white.</p> <p>\u201cThis all impacts on black and minority ethnic students. In the research I\u2019ve done, many people in their final year felt there was a lack of role models. There is some excellent good practice going on in universities, so things may well change in the future. But we\u2019ve got a long way to go in terms of race, and that\u2019s reflected in the statistics.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018If there\u2019s ever a problem, it\u2019s tackled pretty easily\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2518eeadb8ea14bd8b92991e81dec944758edf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2518eeadb8ea14bd8b92991e81dec944758edf4/23_4_239_239/239.jpg\" alt=\"Nuzhat Fatima\" width=\"239\" height=\"239\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Nuzhat Fatima</strong><br><em>Welfare and diversity executive officer, Loughborough Students\u2019 Union</em></p> <p>\u201cAt my institution, I feel that if there\u2019s ever a problem, it\u2019s tackled pretty easily. We have a very good relationship with our vice-chancellor, so if our students are unhappy and we want to make a change, we directly contact the university. They understand that in order for the university to thrive and move forward, they have to support students. But when I look at other universities I don\u2019t really see their vice-chancellors interacting with the students that often. I think having that kind of relationship is key.<br></p> <p>\u201cBeing of Muslim background, coming to a university like Loughborough has been very beneficial for my personal development. And to have this position which celebrates student diversity is very important to me.<br></p> <p>\u201cInstitutional racism exists \u2013 just like institutional sexism and homophobia exist. And because it exists in society, it can\u2019t just be eradicated overnight. But here at Loughborough, we obviously try to tackle every single thing we can, in terms of diversity and inclusion.\u201d<br></p> <h2>\u2018Race does not exist by itself\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"23fda6aaf94305bd9d09130b93e15c90661d65b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23fda6aaf94305bd9d09130b93e15c90661d65b0/219_91_495_495/495.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Deborah Gabriel\" width=\"495\" height=\"495\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Deborah Gabriel<br></strong><em>Lecturer at Bournemouth University and founder of Black British Academics</em></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should only be talking about race. Race does not exist by itself; it works in conjunction with other factors like ethnicity, culture and gender. So I don\u2019t see how you can possibly not adopt an intersectional approach to this.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe latest figures from <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hesa</a> show there are 105 black professors. That\u2019s obviously a dismal figure, but what\u2019s more dismal is that only 30 of those are women. So we need to talk about race and gender, as well as other sites of intersection, like class. We should be concerned with how racial disparity impacts on all ethnic groups and not just present this dichotomy of white and black. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s very little news coverage on the transformation that\u2019s taking place across the sector. The public is given this picture that it\u2019s absolutely dismal and racist in higher education, but that\u2019s not quite the case. Racism is embedded in the education system, just as it is throughout society, but I wouldn\u2019t single out higher education institutions as producing racism. I\u2019m not suggesting at all that universities are beacons of race equality, but I think we should talk more about the transformation and where that\u2019s coming from.<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of the momentum is coming from the students, I\u2019m very proud to say. There have been so many student-led events and <a href=\"https://www.staffs.ac.uk/assets/NUS%20Liberation%20Equality%20and%20Diversity%20in%20the%20Curriculum%202011_tcm44-65179.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> where they are defining and documenting the issues very articulately and making their voices heard.

We\u2019ve got a bigger issue here about how we deal with growing inequality throughout society in the UK. For me, it\u2019s not only about race anymore \u2013 it\u2019s about the whole environment.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe keep on saying that we\u2019ve got a problem. What are we doing about it? Progress remains slow, so we need to do something different. We don\u2019t need more data to tell us that social mobility for these groups is poor. We know it. But we don\u2019t seem to have a working strategy yet for encouraging and developing talent.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, I think we\u2019ve got to be careful to say that universities, at a strategic level, aren\u2019t doing anything about this. I would be surprised if the executive groups in universities aren\u2019t talking about this all the time. But it becomes very hard to see how that actually translates in the curriculum. A framework already exists for promoting equality, diversity and inclusion within the curriculum. I would encourage universities to really examine their processes to ensure that these issues are confronted at the curriculum design stage.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but I think the time for finger-pointing and blaming is over. In the interest of our students we need to be seen to do something proactive about it and be more transparent about what we\u2019re doing.

For example, when we talked about terrorism, people would make generalisations about Muslims. We think of universities as a place where your ideas and views get challenged, but that\u2019s a utopian version of university. My general experience isn\u2019t that. </p> <p>\u201cThe curriculum is white. If people are coming in with a wealth of knowledge and experience that they\u2019ve accumulated culturally in their communities, and that\u2019s not reflected in the curriculum or the things we\u2019re able to do, then we\u2019re not going to get people engaging very much. I\u2019ve challenged this several times when I\u2019ve spoken to lecturers, but they say: \u201cOh, we\u2019ve already written the module.\u201d People are really reluctant to change. I think a lot of this is connected to the way lecturers and academics have been treated in the last five to 10 years. There\u2019s been more casualisation \u2013 my university has lots of casual staff \u2013 and academics have been saddled with a lot of work. So they don\u2019t have a lot of paid opportunity and time to rework these things that students say to them.</p> <p>\u201cThe way universities are set up now, there\u2019s no accountability. They can take your money and do whatever they want. They\u2019re not accountable to you, to give you the best-quality, diverse, great education that you deserve.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p> <p><em><br></em></p> <p><em><br></em></p>",
  "<p>Every household has a food that\u2019s divisive. Round my way, it\u2019s polenta \u2013 I love the stuff, while my husband has never understood the appeal. I\u2019ve converted him with these recipes though, so it\u2019s polenta for dinner every night in our house until spring.</p> <p>Originally, polenta was used as a wider term for anything vaguely grain-like, boiled and bubbled to a smooth porridge and spiked with spices and cheese. It was something I learned to make early on. My first few years as a cook were almost solely in Italian kitchens and a big pot of bubbling polenta was almost always on the stove. I cooked it in massive batches in deep heavy pans that bubbled and boiled and spat like a delicious buttery geyser. It was almost meditative to stand and stir it and then anoint it with butter and so much parmesan that my arm would go numb grating it.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of tradition and opinion when it comes to polenta, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be in trouble with someone for how I cook mine. I\u2019m not suggesting this is the definitive way to do it, but it is how I like it at home. One thing I\u2019d definitely advise: if you\u2019re cooking it on the stovetop, stir it regularly, as with a risotto. This will stop it sticking and enhance its creaminess.</p> <p>When buying polenta, it\u2019s good to know what to look for. I avoid the quick-cooking polenta as the real stuff doesn\u2019t take that long to cook and tastes far better. Like the corn it\u2019s ground from, it comes in a buttery spectrum from deep yellow to just off-white. The white stuff is harder to get hold of and has a more gentle and delicate corn flavour. It also comes in anything from finely ground to very coarse. The coarse one gives a better flavour, but does take a little longer to cook to a silky texture.</p> <p>If polenta is hard to get hold of, you might find the same stuff labelled as cornmeal \u2013 it may be a lot cheaper, too. Bear in mind the finer the grain, the quicker it will cook. The liquid it\u2019s cooked in too is something to consider, a lot of chefs cook it with milk or a mix of milk and water or even stock. I use water and stock respectively, water for the oozy polenta to keep a clean flavour and stock for the bake: you could mix and match as you please.</p> <p>Here I cook polenta in two ways, one on the stove-top that results in the classic spoonable creaminess. The other I cook in the oven, which stays delicious and creamy beneath a crisp crust. Both dishes make a real meal of polenta.</p> <h2><strong>Quick saffron polenta bake </strong></h2> <p>Warming, saffron-scented polenta is double-cooked here \u2013 once in the pan and then finished under the grill with a scattering of squash, kale and feta. The feta crispens and the squash burnishes as the polenta finishes cooking. I love the warming sunny flavour of saffron, but it can be pricey. If you don\u2019t have any at home, you can make this without it, or use another herb, such as thyme or oregano. It won\u2019t taste the same, but it will add another dimension to your polenta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61f0dc9127ed2cf9e75870d2760816b5c3a64ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61f0dc9127ed2cf9e75870d2760816b5c3a64ae0/0_0_2000_1335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quick saffron polenta bake: double-cooked \u2013 once in the pan and then finished under the grill with a scattering of squash, kale and feta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quick saffron polenta bake: double-cooked \u2013 once in the pan and then finished under the grill with a scattering of squash, kale and feta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Issy Croker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>A pinch of saffron strands<br>750ml hot vegetable stock <br>150g coarse polenta or cornmeal<br>50ml olive oil, plus a little extra for saut\u00e9ing veg<br>Salt and black pepper<br>250g piece of butternut squash, skin removed<br>1 head of kale (about 180g) or other winter greens<br>A small bunch of fresh thyme, leaves picked<br>1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced <br>100g feta cheese, crumbled (optional)<br>1 unwaxed lemon, zested<br>A handful of toasted pine nuts<br>A small handful of rocket</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Dissolve the saffron threads in the hot stock.

  "<p>I\u2019d love to love cities, I truly would. Apart from 10 glorious years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/02/joys-of-solitude-lonely\">in the deepest, darkest countryside</a>, on top of a mountain, in the middle of a forest, I\u2019ve spent all my life in them, or the sprawl around them. They\u2019re where the work is, where my friends and family are. </p> <p>Loving cities would make me happier and more at peace with myself. But God, it\u2019s hard. I lie in bed and, like a fat, male, middle-aged Lady Chatterley, dream of a good stiff tramp in the woods. I watch the sun set over south London and wish I was in that woodland glade, listening to the deer bark in the distance.</p> <p>What\u2019s so awful about cities? How long have you got?</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Let\u2019s start with the bleeding obvious: <strong>they\u2019re dirty and smelly</strong>. Forget the dogshit that means you can\u2019t put a foot down without checking the pavement; I\u2019m talking about the air. London, my home town, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/the-truth-about-londons-air-pollution\">loses up to 9,000 inhabitants to air pollution every year</a>. When it doesn\u2019t kill you, smog sucks the pleasure out of life. Only when I left the city, in my early 40s, did I realise I actually had a sense of smell. When I moved to the Vosges, famous in France for the pure air and pine-scented forests, I was shocked to discover I could smell the wind, the grass, the trees. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/make-your-own\">I even became a reasonable cook</a>, now I could <a href=\"http://www.fifthsense.org.uk/smell-taste-and-flavour/\">properly taste </a>what I was working with.</p> <p><strong>2 There are too many people</strong>. I don\u2019t hate humans, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/02/joys-of-solitude-lonely\">I\u2019m not afraid of solitude</a> and want to choose who I see and talk to. In the city everyone is in your face, all the time, usually wanting something, from your money to your seat on the tube. You know what rats do once their cages get overcrowded? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2016/mar/23/science-ballard-high-rise-animal-research-pathological-overcrowding\">They start eating each other</a>.</p> <p><strong>3 Even one person can be too many</strong>. An empty street is unsettling in a way that a deserted lane never is. At any minute, a stranger could leap out and beg you to make regular monthly payments to a guinea pig charity. There are no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/secret-life-chugger-charity-fundraiser\">chuggers</a> in the countryside. Axe murderers, yes, but nowhere\u2019s perfect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d663c792fde821fef01b58616206c10e233b7c20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d663c792fde821fef01b58616206c10e233b7c20/0_103_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brilliant mistake: \u2018The country has lakes and mountains.

The country has lakes, mountains, trees, wildlife, star-spangled night skies, stirring sunrises and glorious sunsets. The city? Tarmac, buildings, billboards, other people (see point two) and dogshit (see point one). Parks? They\u2019re just wannabe fields. Canals? Constipated rivers. And when night falls, house lights, headlamps and floodlights mean you can\u2019t even see the stars. My wife, who detests everything rural, yawns and starts checking her phone whenever I get the opportunity to educate her about the constellations. But she\u2019s a philistine. There\u2019s a majesty to the heavens that can only be appreciated far from streetlights. And she might as well put that phone away. You don\u2019t get 3G coverage where we\u2019re going.</p> <p><strong>5 It\u2019s so hard to get around the city</strong>. Public transport is expensive, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/southern-rail-cancels-gatwick-express-trains-and-slows-down-services-and-pins-the-blame-on-leaves-a3375441.html\">unreliable</a> and rarely deposits you precisely where you want to be. Cycling turns you into a self-righteous prig. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/lazy-britons-joy-of-walking-cycling-walkers\">Every walk is an obstacle course</a>, thanks to cars blocking the pavement, cyclists who refuse to stop at junctions and town planners who see pedestrians as unwelcome impediments to their dream of turning the world into a fume-filled Formula One track. Driving is slow and expensive, and parking is banned or unaffordable anywhere you actually want to do it. In the countryside\u2026 well, you will need a car, given how rubbish most rural bus and train services are, but once you\u2019ve got one, you\u2019re golden. Speed limits are reasonable and poorly enforced, and you can park pretty much anywhere, so long as the muck-spreaders can get by. Even the most territorial farmer won\u2019t grumble if you stick your Twingo on his grass verge. </p> <p>And you\u2019ll <em>still</em> walk at every opportunity, because it\u2019s so much fun.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> <strong>The total absence of weather</strong>. Out in the wilds, the elements hit you full-on; first you learn to survive the weather, then you start to enjoy it. In a big city, you can spend days without knowing if it\u2019s raining or shining, so sheltered are you on your trip from home to bus to tube to work and back again. Show me a man without a Gore-Tex jacket in his bag and I\u2019ll show you a pasty-faced townie, afraid of the slightest spattering of rain when he should be glorying in its dance on his face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebde5a05748491ab63cc5ac90e7dcb4ade814090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebde5a05748491ab63cc5ac90e7dcb4ade814090/0_147_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Since you\u2019ve got the buses and tubes, you tell yourself you might as well use them.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Since you\u2019ve got the buses and tubes, you tell yourself you might as well use them.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leo Correa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7 Urban living makes you lazy</strong>. Since you\u2019ve got the buses and tubes, you tell yourself you might as well use them, even when you could easily do the journey on foot. Have you ever tried to get on a bus when the schoolkids are heading home? You\u2019ll never see so many unhealthy-looking blobs, all hogging the seats for just three or four stops.</p> <p><strong>8 And they\u2019ll be stuffing their faces with crisps, chips and chocolate</strong> when they could be foraging for wild strawberries, hazelnuts or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/16/wild-mushroom-picking\">mushrooms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/29/snails-are-not-fast-food\">snails</a>. Away from the city, friendly locals \u2013 everyone\u2019s friendly in the countryside, as well as handsome and intelligent \u2013 will give you venison that they\u2019ve shot themselves. My home in the Vosges wasn\u2019t a fancy place, but it had a trout pond, dug out by a neighbour who never even billed me for his time or the use of his bulldozer. And a veg patch, full of beans and peas, salad and onions, shallots and garlic, sweetcorn and potatoes, kohlrabi and jerusalem artichokes, courgettes and cabbages, pumpkins, radishes, chard, chives, rosemary, parsley and thyme. Of course you can grow fruit and veg in town, if you have a big enough garden or access to an allotment, but you\u2019ll spend a lot of time clearing up after cats. They love freshly turned earth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/31/why-i-love-living-in-cities-tolerant-generous-lawless\">Tolerant, generous \u2013 and a little bit lawless.

All you need is a branch to hold on to and a few large leaves to clear up with, though old hands never to take a hike without a pocket full of loo paper. When my septic tank broke down, I dug a hole a short walk from the house and spent a week making like a bear in the woods. Try doing that if you live near Epping Forest or the Bois de Boulogne. Or rather, don\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>10 The sporting facilities are better in the countryside</strong>. My local running track was <a href=\"http://www.gerardmer.net/details-villages.php?id_cible=3\">a forest-fringed plateau</a>, with hundreds of kilometres of empty roads and shady paths. My swimming pool was <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lac+de+longemer+vosges&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmyez3u_nPAhXiDMAKHa2VDXMQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=803\">a mountain lake</a> \u2013 free to use, so long that a single length would take you almost an hour, and with water as clear as anything that ever came out of a tap.

  "<p>MPs will on Monday debate a ban on driven grouse shooting following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/28/grouse-shooting-estates-shored-up-by-millions-in-subsidies\">petition signed by more than 120,000 people</a>. But there will be one missing signature that could have swayed the argument decisively behind a ban: that of the RSPB. <br></p> <p>As a former employee and lifelong member I have become increasingly frustrated with the society\u2019s desire to protect hen harriers by arguing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/rspb-calls-for-grouse-shooting-estates-to-be-licensed\">new laws to licence moors</a> but not supporting a ban. It is a position which I strongly believe many of its 1 million-plus members now also find untenable. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/07/mps-to-debate-ban-on-grouse-shooting\">MPs to debate ban on grouse shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the number of breeding hen harriers in England has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/long-awaited-plan-to-save-englands-hen-harrier-gets-green-light\">plummeted to nearly nothing due</a> to illegal persecution, the RSPB has found itself having to take sides in an increasingly polarised debate. In response it has doggedly stuck to position of arguing that dialogue and reform is the way forward, even after withdrawing its support from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/491818/hen-harrier-action-plan-england-2016.pdf\">hen harrier action plan</a> because, <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/martinharper/archive/2016/07/25/withdrawal-from-the-hhap.aspx\">according to its conservation director</a>, Martin Harper, \u201cthe voluntary approach has failed\u201d.<br></p> <p>In advance of the debate, the RSPB has lobbied MPs not to back the ban but instead support its call for a change in the law. The organisation seems to forget that the law can sometimes be an ass, especially when it comes to protecting hen harriers. Why would a new law to licence moors be any more effective than one protecting the species - which clearly has failed? At best it is naive and at worst it would yet again let the shooting lobby off the hook.<br></p> <p>Like so many ordinary rank and file RSPB members, I added my name to the petition because I believe that only a ban will allow the hen harrier population to recover. Going from a potential breeding population of more than 300 pairs to only a \u201ctiny handful\u201d this year is a conservation disaster requiring urgent action, not lobbying for new legislation which would be years away at best.<br></p> <p>What causes me particular consternation is that - shamefully - the RSPB senior management seems to have already written off the result of the debate. Their head of nature policy, <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/martinharper/archive/2016/08/13/100-000-people-call-for-a-ban-on-driven-grouse-shooting.aspx\">Jeff Knott, stat</a>ed: \u201cI\u2019d be amazed if either a ban or licensing was introduced off the back of it\u201d. </p> <p>Given that the petition will have been signed by many of his members, the RSPB\u2019s chief executive, Mike Clarke, would do well to caution his senior staff not to write any further hostages to fortune.<br></p> <p>The RSPB\u2019s stance has also brought it into conflict with many leading conservationists, from the author of the petition, Mark Avery, to the TV presenter Chris Packham. </p> <p>Avery, its former director of conservation for nearly 13 years and my boss when I worked in the RSPB\u2019s research department, has becoming increasingly irate with the society but has declined to publicly criticise it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/01/chris-packham-slams-shameful-silence-of-britains-conservation-charities\">Packham has gone further</a>, publicly slamming its stance as \u201cshameful\u201d but again stopping short of resigning as its vice-president. <br></p> <p>The reluctance to criticise the RSPB is understandable as no one wants to hand victory to the likes those representing the shooting lobby. As a major landowner itself, the RSPB also finds itself in the unenviable position of having to work with other landowners and gamekeepers on the ground every day. However, its stance has undeniably split the conservation lobby, meaning its voice in parliament during the debate will be considerably weakened. </p> <p>If, as the RSPB predicts, MPs do not back a ban, then the society needs to ask itself some very difficult questions. Could the support of its million-plus members and its influence in parliament have tipped the debate in favour of a ban? And more importantly is its senior management team\u2019s stance now at odds with its membership on the issue? </p> <p>The only sure way to answer this question would be to ballot its members. For the sake of England\u2019s dwindling hen harrier population, this vote cannot come soon enough.</p>",

  "<h2>\u2018We must remember the richness immigrants have brought\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Monica, 51, Vermont, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></li> </ul> <p>I live in a tiny rural town in Vermont. The daughter of Peruvian immigrants who overstayed visas back when it took just a few months to get a green card; I\u2019ve worked hard to feel like I belong anywhere. I found my way to Vermont as a young adult and no other place feels like home. I am voting for Hilary Clinton, although my preference would have been Bernie Sanders. Hillary\u2019s approach seems to be informed by her years of experience and that\u2019s what I want in a president \u2013 someone who is intelligent and informed about both policy and process. A Trump presidency would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d as he\u2019s so fond of saying. I get no sense that he has any knowledge of, or worse, the desire to learn about, the issues at all. That\u2019s truly frightening. Trump would further divide our nation \u2013 his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides. We must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country. The first priority of the next president must be to unify us, as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere. This has been the ugliest campaign I have witnessed in my 51 years. Trump\u2019s campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover. One good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and encouraged them to make their voices heard at the ballot box \u2013 for better or worse.</p> <h2>\u2018We have become a politically correct society to our detriment\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Anne-Marie, 69, New Jersey, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>Born in 1946, the first year of the \u201cbaby boom\u201d, I am a second-generation American. I earned my BA, MEd and MA in, respectively, history, teaching and journalism. Most of my working life was in publishing. I have been alone since my divorce some 40 years ago. My views do not fit any one party, and my voting history is mixed. I have voted for Democrats and Republicans, and I threw away a vote on Ralph Nader in 2000 because I could not vote for either of the main candidates. I will vote for Donald Trump. He might not change this country \u2013 Congress can obstruct a president, as it has been doing since 2008 \u2013 but if he could, it would be in directions I support: defeating Isis, strict(er) immigration, encouraging businesses to stay or return here, a much better relationship with Russia, and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we have, to our detriment, become. A president\u2019s priorities should be protecting the American land and people, and promoting the general welfare \u2013 here, stateside. I have found the campaign absolutely horrid. The only good thing about election day is that it ends the campaign. </p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Wendy, 63, California, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m 63 years old, a Democrat, and a retired registered nurse.

This election is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and I lived through Watergate and the Vietnam war. Donald Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me. I\u2019m worried that Russia\u2019s attempt to influence the outcome of this election in Trump\u2019s favor might yet succeed. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m angrier at \u2013 Donald Trump for being a compulsive liar \u2013 or the press for letting him get away with it. Trump\u2019s supporters chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d are the worst. Hillary Clinton is not a criminal! We face serious problems with no easy solutions. Over 20% of our children live in poverty. Climate change is real. We have too many guns and not enough good jobs. Our son is unemployed \u2013 I don\u2019t want Obamacare repealed \u2013 I want it fixed. Hillary has a plan for that. Hillary cares about people, about children and families. She\u2019s a feminist who will appoint supreme court justices who will stand up for women\u2019s rights. Especially if the Democrats take back the Senate, she can get things done. Even Trump conceded that she\u2019s a fighter. This is a historic election and, yeah, I\u2019m excited about it. I didn\u2019t think a woman president would happen in my lifetime. On November 8th, I hope we will elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president of the United States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Livingston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I will remain apprehensive until she is president-elect\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Sarah, 28, Florida, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a third-year medical student living in Brooklyn, NY, voting by mail as a Florida resident. My vote this year is unequivocally going to Hillary Clinton. There is a vocal proportion of Clinton voters who make no secret of their reluctant support, whether grudging Bernie Sanders advocates, or voters of any persuasion who oppose Donald Trump only marginally more than they do Clinton. Despite having backed Sanders myself, I take a less noncommittal position: Clinton, far from being the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d, is a remarkably qualified, intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my own, a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread. Her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the United States to stand upright as a respected model among nations. I anticipate with hope the improvement of the Affordable Care Act to make healthcare universally affordable, the push to end gun violence, the increase in police accountability, the reform of our prison system, and a social promotion that advances race relations, LGBT rights and gender equity. None of these changes can be expected under the influence of Donald Trump, who sees the truth as tractable, promotes his sexism and narcissism as assets, and in the end, is excessively volatile and unprincipled. It\u2019s embarrassing that Clinton, whose political competence is nigh unparalleled, holds only an uncertain majority over his farcical campaign. While the current poll aggregates are tentatively reassuring, I will remain apprehensive until she is confirmed as president-elect after election day.</p> <h2>\u2018Washington is offering no choice besides disaster\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Geno, 37, Pennsylvania, voting for <strong>Jill Stein</strong></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m in that middle class suffering from decades of neoliberalism \u2013 involuntarily in debt, in a dead-end job because of health coverage and few options. My household can eat and pay bills most of the time, so we\u2019re luckier than some, but doing much more is a rare treat. The nation needs living wages, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, renewable energy, an end to US aggression, and investment in our future instead of the already-rich. Society should support people over profit. The most wretched excuse for a campaign in our lifetimes has only promised the opposite. The major parties offer a deranged rightwing sociopath provoking global war or a reality-TV buffoon with no actual policy, both of them hopelessly corrupt and staggeringly incompetent. Reinforcing Bush-Obama corporatism isn\u2019t an option. Libertarianism is suicidally shortsighted. We need a progressive administration that\u2019ll keep the grassroots engaged in fighting for constructive, sustainable goals. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting Jill Stein. It\u2019s already too late to prevent a president Clinton; that\u2019s what the establishment wants and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll get. Of course Trump never had a chance \u2013 he\u2019s only there to scare us towards Hillary. No thanks. I won\u2019t throw my vote away on a felon and war criminal. I\u2019d rather affirm policies I actually support. The alternative is staying home, but I\u2019d rather send a message rejecting business as usual (hopefully amplified a little in a swing state). Washington is offering no choice besides disaster. Our first duty is to refuse to be complicit or legitimize it.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist Donald Trump\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Chris, 50, New York, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>My name is Christopher; I am a gay African American illustrator and comic book artist living in New York City with my husband who is an Episcopal seminarian. As a Bernie Sanders supporter, allow me to make my position crystal clear: I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist, racist and misogynist Donald Trump. I would love to have another choice, but unfortunately, with Jill Stein polling even worse than Gary Johnson I\u2019m forced to be pragmatic and vote for Hillary Clinton. Liberal supreme court nominations; banking, healthcare, student loan and immigration reform; increasing living wages, honest discussions of the true effects of mechanization of labor, infrastructure revitalization, climate change, federal enforcement of police reform \u2026 these should be presidential priorities. Will they be under a centrist Clinton administration? Doubtful. Still, it is my sincere hope that the more progressive side of the Democratic party will apply the appropriate pressure. This entire presidential campaign has been a demoralizing debacle, and I for one can\u2019t wait until election day. I\u2019m just going to need a shower or two to scrub off the stink after leaving the voting booth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, 28 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, on 28 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Had Sanders won the primaries, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Dan, 59, California, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>My name is Dan and I\u2019m an older, white, middle-class male who intends to vote for Donald Trump. But I didn\u2019t start out that way. Although I\u2019ve been a Republican since registering to vote at age 18 I switched to the Democratic party this year in order to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary election. Had Sanders won the Democratic primary I wouldn\u2019t be writing this little essay and I would most definitely <em>not</em> be voting for Donald Trump. Let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not voting for Trump because I like him. I\u2019m voting for Trump \u2019cause I like Hillary Clinton even less. I don\u2019t think policy positions matter much in a presidential election. Presidents don\u2019t actually get to direct much policy. What matters most to me is leadership. The ability to lead a large organization and inspire those being led. In this respect both candidates have serious liabilities. But Hillary\u2019s appear to be the far more serious breaches of integrity. From her early days on the Nixon impeachment issue to her operation of the state department she has left behind a taint of corruption at the highest levels of government. We are already hearing of the rumblings of disorganization and discontent in both the state and justice department as a result of her corrupting influence. The priority of a president should be to manage the immense federal bureaucracy and inspire citizens. Hillary has proven herself to be singularly inadequate to the task.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m a Mormon Republican voting for Clinton\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>David, 43, Colorado, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a westerner, having lived and voted in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. I\u2019m educated, with two postgraduate degrees. I\u2019m also religious, having been Mormon all my life. I\u2019ve been a registered Republican since my first voting experience in 1996. I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. Or, to put it more precisely, I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump. The most important factor for me in voting for any public office is character, and I think it is obvious that Trump has the worst character of any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen. There are many very reasonable objections to Clinton, and I\u2019m really not a big fan of hers, but I don\u2019t think they come anywhere close to the magnitude of Trump\u2019s deep moral flaws. I think Clinton is a very capable politician, and I like her experience in public service. I also think she\u2019s quite moderate, which is what I consider myself to be. Presidents are important, but they can\u2019t do all the things for which people often hold them responsible. I think she\u2019ll do well at foreign relations. I think she\u2019ll choose capable but moderate supreme court justices, and I hope that Congress will approve them. This has been a miserable campaign, not just because of the poor field of candidates and the disgusting rhetoric, but also because it has divided the citizenry in very ugly ways. I am voting early, by mail, and I look forward to having the whole thing finished.</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>The emails currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">roiling the US presidential campaign</a> are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">slowly released by WikiLeaks</a> from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week\u2019s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.</p> <p>The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\u2019t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent.</p> <p>They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59n4x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851228\"            data-video-name=\"'We learned to fight back': Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58140c67e4b08d944ba4bd15\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028Daca_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028Daca_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12004004&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\">\u2018We learned to fight back\u2019: Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone\u2019s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people\u2019s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don\u2019t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren\u2019t.</p> <p>With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.</p> <p>The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement.</p> <p>Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary\u2019s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton\">appear to name</a> President Obama\u2019s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).</p> <p>The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15865\">email</a> Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29255\">visit</a> Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to \u201clearn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action\u201d). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley\u2019s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19482\">complains</a> that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be:</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.\u201d</p> <p>Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, \u201cmadness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue\u201d.</p> <p>There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words \u201cDavos\u201d or \u201cTahoe\u201d. But it is when you search \u201cVineyard\u201d on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By \u201cvineyard\u201d, of course, they mean Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the 2015 <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30396\">email</a> from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that \u201cHillary\u2019s image is being torn apart in the media and there\u2019s not enough effective push back\u201d. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24270\">invites</a> Podesta to a dinner featuring \u201cfood produced exclusively by the island\u2019s farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines\u201d. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19449\">recommended</a> that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that \u201cIt wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make \u2013 but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events\u201d. We even read the <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32784\">pleadings</a> of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he \u201cjoined the DSCC Majority Trust in Martha\u2019s Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>(Hilariously, in another <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8640\">email chain</a>, the Clinton team appears to scheme to \u201chit\u201d Bernie Sanders for attending \u201cDSCC retreats on Martha\u2019s Vineyard with lobbyists\u201d.)</p> <p>Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta \u2013 the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite \u2013 for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.</p> <p>This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927\">appears to think</a> that any kind of bank reform should \u201ccome from the industry itself\u201d. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another\u2019s careers, constantly.</p> <p>Everything blurs into everything else in this world.

  "<p>Political and economic earthquakes are often sudden and unforeseeable, despite the false pundits who pop up later to claim they predicted them all along \u2013 take the fall of the Berlin Wall, the 2008 global financial crisis, or the Arab Spring (and ensuing winter). Even at a personal level, change is largely unpredictable: how many of us can say our lives have gone according to the plans we had as 16-year-olds? </p> <p>The essential mystery of the future poses a huge challenge to activists. If change is only explicable in the rear-view mirror, how can we accurately envision the future changes we seek, let alone achieve them? How can we be sure our proposals will make things better, and not fall victim to unintended consequences? People employ many concepts to grapple with such questions. I find \u201csystems\u201d and \u201ccomplexity\u201d two of the most helpful. </p> <p>A \u201csystem\u201d is an interconnected set of elements coherently organised in a way that achieves something. It is more than the sum of its parts: a body is more than an aggregate of individual cells; a university is not merely an agglomeration of individual students, professors, and buildings; an ecosystem is not just a set of individual plants and animals. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The neat narrative sequence of cause and effect I\u2019ve just written, of course, is only possible in hindsight.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A defining property of human systems is complexity: because of the sheer number of relationships and feedback loops among their many elements, they cannot be reduced to simple chains of cause and effect. Think of a crowd on a city street, or a flock of starlings wheeling in the sky at dusk. Even with supercomputers, it is impossible to predict the movement of any given person or starling, but there is order; amazingly few collisions occur even on the most crowded streets. </p> <p>In complex systems, change results from the interplay of many diverse and apparently unrelated factors. Those of us engaged in seeking change need to identify which elements are important and understand how they interact. </p> <p>My interest in systems thinking began when collecting stories for my book From Poverty to Power. The light-bulb moment came on a visit to India\u2019s Bundelkhand region, where the poor fishing communities of Tikamgarh had won rights to more than 150 large ponds. In that struggle numerous factors interacted to create change. First, a technological shift triggered changes in behaviour: the introduction of new varieties of fish, which made the ponds more profitable, induced landlords to seize ponds that had been communal. Conflict then built pressure for government action: a group of 12 brave young fishers in one village fought back, prompting a series of violent clashes that radicalized and inspired other communities; women\u2019s groups were organized for the first time, taking control of nine ponds. Enlightened politicians and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) helped pass new laws and the police amazed everyone by enforcing them. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2e2d247402d83ca72060c258c43d5e1ce46c7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e2d247402d83ca72060c258c43d5e1ce46c7a1/0_0_2200_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East and West German citizens climbing the Berlin wall at the Brandenburg gate in Berlin on November 9, 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East and West German citizens climb the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg gate on 9 November 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fishing communities were the real heroes of the story. They tenaciously faced down a violent campaign of intimidation, moved from direct action to advocacy, and ended up winning not only access to the ponds but a series of legal and policy changes that benefited all fishing families. </p> <p>The neat narrative sequence of cause and effect I\u2019ve just written, of course, is only possible in hindsight. In the thick of the action, no-one could have said why the various actors acted as they did, or what transformed the relative power of each. Tikamgarh\u2019s experience highlights how unpredictable is the interaction between structures (such as state institutions), agency (by communities and individuals), and the broader context (characterized by shifts in technology, environment, demography, or norms). </p> <p>Unfortunately, the way we commonly think about change projects onto the future the neat narratives we draw from the past. Many of the mental models we use are linear plans \u2013 \u201cif A, then B\u201d \u2013 with profound consequences in terms of failure, frustration, and missed opportunities. As Mike Tyson memorably said, \u201cEveryone has a plan \u2019til they get punched in the mouth\u201d. </p> <p>Let me illustrate with a metaphor. Baking a cake is a linear \u201csimple\u201d system. All I need do is find a recipe, buy the ingredients, make sure the oven is working, mix, bake, et voila! Some cakes are better than others (mine wouldn\u2019t win any prizes), but the basic approach is fixed, replicable, and reasonably reliable. However bad your cake, you\u2019ll probably be able to eat it. </p> <p>The trouble is that real life rarely bakes like a cake. Engaging a complex system is more like raising a child. What fate would await your new baby if you decided to go linear and design a project plan setting out activities, assumptions, outputs, and outcomes for the next twenty years and then blindly followed it? Nothing good, probably. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>As Mike Tyson memorably said, \u2018Everyone has a plan 'til they get punched in the mouth\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, parents make it up as they go along. And so they should. Raising a child is iterative, an endless testing of assumptions about right and wrong, a constant adaptation to the evolving nature of the child and his or her relationship with their parents and others. Despite all the \u201cbest practice\u201d guides preying on the insecurity of new parents, child-rearing is devoid of any \u201cright way\u201d of doing things. What really helps parents is experience (the second kid is usually easier), and the advice and reassurance of people who\u2019ve been through it themselves \u2013 \u201cmentoring\u201d in management speak. Working in complex systems requires the same kind of iterative, collaborative, and flexible approach. Deng Xiaoping\u2019s recipe for China\u2019s take off epitomises this approach: \u201cWe will cross the river by feeling the stones under our feet, one by one\u201d. <br></p> <p>Systems are in a state of constant change. Jean Boulton, one of the authors of Embracing Complexity, likes to use the metaphor of the forest, which typically goes through cycles of growth, collapse, regeneration, and new growth. In the early part of the cycle\u2019s growth phase, the number of species and of individual plants and animals increases quickly, as organisms arrive to exploit all available ecological niches. The forest\u2019s components become more linked to one another, enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s \u201cconnectedness\u201d and multiplying the ways the forest regulates itself and maintains its stability. However, the forest\u2019s very connectedness and efficiency eventually reduce its capacity to cope with severe outside shocks, paving the way for a collapse and eventual regeneration. Jean argues that activists need to adapt their analysis and strategy according to the stage that their political surroundings most closely resemble: growth, maturity, locked-in but fragile, or collapsing. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29abb686f68701cdb8e1768c54321d985439782b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29abb686f68701cdb8e1768c54321d985439782b/0_169_2847_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold Macmillan, then UK prime minister, with president John F.

Similarly, my experience of activism has obliged me to question linear approaches to campaigning, for example, as I hesitantly embraced the realisation that change doesn\u2019t happen like that. </p> <p>Once I began thinking about systems, I started to see complexity and unpredictable \u201cemergent change\u201d everywhere \u2013 in politics, economics, at work, and even in the lives of those around me. </p> <h2><strong>Crises as critical junctures </strong></h2> <p>Change in complex systems occurs in slow, steady processes such as demographic shifts and in sudden, unforeseeable jumps. Nothing seems to change until suddenly it does, a stop\u2013start rhythm that can confound activists. When British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was asked what he most feared in politics, he reportedly replied in his wonderfully patrician style, \u201cEvents, dear boy\u201d. Such \u201cevents\u201d that disrupt social, political, or economic relations are not just a prime ministerial headache. They can open the door to previously unthinkable reforms. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Working in complex systems requires the same kind of iterative, collaborative, and flexible approach as raising a child</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such \u201ccritical junctures\u201d, as the economists Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson call them, force political leaders to question their long-held assumptions about what constitutes \u201csound\u201d policies, and make them more willing to take the risks associated with innovation, as the status quo suddenly appears less worth defending. </p> <p>Much of the institutional framework we take for granted today was born of the trauma of the Great Depression and the second world war. The disastrous failures of policy that led to these twin catastrophes profoundly affected the thinking of political and economic leaders across the world, triggering a vastly expanded role for government in managing the economy and addressing social ills, as well as precipitating the decolonisation of large parts of the globe. </p> <p>Similarly, in the 1970s the sharp rise in oil prices (and consequent economic stagnation and runaway inflation) marked the end of the post-war \u201cGolden Age\u201d and gave rise to a turn away from government regulation and to the idealisation of the \u201cfree market\u201d. In communist systems, at different moments, political and economic upheaval paved the way for radical economic shifts in China and Vietnam. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1560bc886c3edb8373156e9272841ab0bd11002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1560bc886c3edb8373156e9272841ab0bd11002/0_0_2220_1524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Goswick removes mud from the entrance of the Gorenflo Elementary School in Gulfport, Miss., on Friday, Sept. 9, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Goswick removes mud from the entrance of the Gorenflo Elementary School after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milton Friedman, the father of monetarist economics, wrote: \u201cOnly a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\u201d </p> <p>Naomi Klein, in her 2007 book The Shock Doctrine, argues that the right has used shocks much better than the left, especially in recent decades. Klein cites the example of how proponents of private education in the US managed to turn Hurricane Katrina to their advantage: \u201cWithin 19 months, New Orleans\u2019 public school system had been almost completely replaced by privately-run charter schools.\u201d According to the American Enterprise Institute, \u201cKatrina accomplished in a day what Louisiana school reformers couldn\u2019t do after years of trying.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"408600ee309fb6e557f6b2b7ecea8a937efeeace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/408600ee309fb6e557f6b2b7ecea8a937efeeace/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Egyptian boy flashes a Victory sign during a protest in central Cairo, Egypt, 29 June 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Egyptian boy flashes a victory sign during a protest in Cairo in June 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Omar/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NGOs are not always so nimble in spotting and seizing such opportunities. Three months into the 2011 Egyptian revolution, I attended a meeting of Oxfam International\u2019s chief executive officers (CEOs), at which they spent hours debating whether the uprising in Tahrir Square was likely to lead to a humanitarian crisis. Only then did the penny drop that the protests, upheaval, and overthrow of an oppressive regime were also a huge potential opportunity, at which point the assembled bosses showed admirable speed in allocating budgets for supporting civil society activists in Egypt, and backing it up with advocacy at the Arab League and elsewhere. But by then valuable time had passed; soon the optimism of revolution gave way to the violence and misery of repression. </p> <p>Some progressive activists engaged in policy advocacy are better attuned to Friedman\u2019s lesson. Within weeks of the appalling Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,100 people in April 2013 an international \u201cAccord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh\u201d was signed and delivered. A five-year legally binding agreement between global companies, retailers, and trade unions, the accord mandates some astounding breakthroughs: an independent inspection programme supported by the brand-name companies and involving workers and trade unions; the public disclosure of all factories, inspection reports, and corrective action plans; a commitment by signatory brands to fund improvements and maintain sourcing relationships; democratically elected health and safety committees in all factories; and worker empowerment through an extensive training programme, complaints mechanism, and the right to refuse unsafe work. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change</p> <footer> <cite>Milton Friedman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In hindsight, we can point to several factors to explain how this grisly \u201cshock as opportunity\u201d drove rapid movement toward better regulation: </p> <ul> <li>A forum on labour rights in Bangladesh (the Ethical Trading Initiative) had already built a high degree of trust between traditional antagonists (companies, unions, and NGOs). Trust allowed people to get on the phone to each other right away. </li> <li>Prior work, underway since 2011, had sketched the outline of a potential accord; the Rana Plaza disaster massively escalated the pressure to act on it. </li> <li>A nascent national process (the National Action Plan for Fire Safety) gave outsiders something to support and build on. </li> <li>Energetic leadership from two new international trade unions (IndustriALL and UNI Global Union) helped get the right people in the room. Perhaps we should add to Friedman\u2019s instruction \u201cto keep alternatives alive and available\u201d: progressive activists also need to build trust and connections among the key individuals who could implement the desired change. I am not suggesting that activists become ambulance chasers, jumping on every crisis to make their point. Rather, we must understand the windows of opportunity provided by \u201cevents, dear boy\u201d as critical junctures when our long-term work creating constituencies for change, transforming attitudes and norms, and so on can suddenly come to fruition.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Positive deviance </strong></h2> <p>One of the most exciting alternatives to business as usual goes by the name of \u201cpositive deviance\u201d. </p> <p>In December 1991, Jerry and Monique Sternin arrived in Vietnam to work for Save the Children in four communities with children aged under three, most of whom were malnourished. The Sternins asked teams of volunteers to observe in homes where children were poor but well-fed. In every case they found that the mother or father was collecting a number of tiny shrimps, crabs, or snails \u2013 making for a portion \u201cthe size of one joint of one finger\u201d \u2013 from the rice paddies and adding these to the child\u2019s diet. <br></p> <p>These \u201cpositive deviant\u201d families also instructed the home babysitter to feed the child four or even five times a day, in contrast to most families who fed young children only before parents headed to the rice fields early in the morning and in the late afternoon after returning from a working day. Results were shared on a board in the town hall, and the charts quickly became a focus of attention and buzz. By the end of the first year, 80 per cent of the children in the programme were fully rehabilitated. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"34bc22b1fb27c69ff37054da8aa59e2cf0b58403\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34bc22b1fb27c69ff37054da8aa59e2cf0b58403/0_0_6202_4134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 2013 more than 300 workers were killed when the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2013 more than 1,100 workers were killed when the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Biraj/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their book, The Power of Positive Deviance, the Sternins, with Richard Pascale, describe how the approach was subsequently applied in 50 countries to everything from decreasing gang violence in inner city New Jersey to reducing sex-trafficking of girls in rural Indonesia. The starting point is to \u201clook for outliers who succeed against the odds\u201d. But who is doing the looking also matters. If external \u201cexperts\u201d investigate the outliers and turn the results into a toolkit, little will come of it. When communities make the discovery for themselves, behavioural change can take root \u2013 providing what the authors call \u201csocial proof\u201d. <br></p> <p>Positive deviance capitalises on a hugely energising fact: for any given problem, someone in the community will have already identified a solution. It focuses on people\u2019s assets and knowledge, rather than their lacks and problems. The Sternins recount their experience in Misiones Province, Argentina, where dropout rates were awful. Teachers and principals were hostile to criticism and put the blame on the parents. All that started to change when facilitators asked the \u201csomersault question\u201d: why were dropout rates much lower in some schools? Teachers then agreed to ask the parents at those schools, who rapidly identified teacher attitudes toward parents as the key. The positive deviant teachers were negotiating informal annual \u201clearning contracts\u201d with parents. When many teachers adopted that approach, dropout rates in test schools fell by 50%. </p> <p>Despite its success, positive deviance remains an outlier in the aid business. The \u201cstandard model\u201d of identifying gaps, devising initiatives to fill them, and disseminating the guidance is incredibly hard to budge. Perhaps not surprisingly, experts are often part of the problem. The Sternins write: \u201cThose eking out existence on the margins of society grasp the simple elegance of the PD approach \u2013 in contrast to the sceptical consideration of the more educated and/or privileged. Uptake seems in inverse proportion to prosperity, formal authority, years of schooling and degrees hanging on walls.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Positive deviance sees that for any problem, someone in the community will have already identified a solution</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can vouch from personal experience how hard it is to give up my learned role and become a facilitator. Holding back from providing your own answer when you ask a group a question is, as the Sternins put it, \u201cmore difficult than trying to stifle an oncoming sneeze\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>Thinking in systems should change everything</strong><br></h2> <p>In the first film in the Matrix series (the only one worth watching), the hero, Neo, suddenly starts to see the matrix of ones and zeroes that lies beneath the surface of his world, at which point he becomes invincible. I have the same feeling about systems (aside from the invincibility part). Thinking in systems should change everything, including the way we look at politics, economics, society, and even ourselves, in new and exciting ways. <br></p> <p>It also poses a devastating challenge to traditional linear planning approaches and to our ways of working. We activists need to become better \u201creflectivists\u201d, taking the time to understand the system before (and while) engaging with it. We need to better understand the stop\u2013start rhythm of change exhibited by complex systems and adapt our efforts accordingly. And we need to become less arrogant, more willing to learn from accidents, from failures, and from other people. Finally, we have to make friends with ambiguity and uncertainty, while maintaining the energy and determination so essential to changing the world. </p> <p>It isn\u2019t easy, but it is entirely possible, as I hope I have shown. Once we learn to \u201cdance with the system\u201d, no other partner will do. </p> <p><em>\u2018<a href=\"http://how-change-happens.com/\">How change happens</a>\u2019 by Duncan Green is published by Oxford University Press. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Vladimir Putin has a personal dislike of Hillary Clinton going back to her time as secretary of state, while Trump fits perfectly into the mould of \u201cchaos candidates\u201d that Russia has supported in other western countries.</p> <p>It would take a conspiracy theorist to believe Trump is actually a Kremlin stooge rather than simply a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d, and some in Russia believed a Trump presidency could actually have more potential for conflict than a Clinton one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/14/hillary-clinton-email-hack-russia-cybersecurity\">Entire US political system \u2018under attack\u2019 by Russian hacking, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Clinton, relations would be unlikely to be rosy but would probably stay within a long-established paradigm of mutual distrust and limited cooperation on certain issues.<br></p> <p>US politics tends to be portrayed as driven by geopolitical interests rather than personalities, and so most ordinary Russians assume that little will change, whoever wins. Still, the warm words about Putin from Trump, and the slightly more positive tone of television coverage relating to the real estate tycoon, have both left their mark.

If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs.</p> <p>South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula.</p> <p>Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it.

The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt.<br></p> <p>Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans.<br></p> <p>Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media. Some suggested that perhaps the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, would need to fly to Washington to broker a national unity government deal, as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, did after the divisive 2014 Afghan election.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sune-engel-rasmussen\">Sune Engel Rasmussen</a> in Kabul</em></p> <h2>Germany </h2> <p>If Hillary Clinton were to run against Donald Trump for the German presidency, she would win by a landslide.

  "<p>A dozen international poverty and development organizations <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/10589-beyond-coal-scaling-clean-energy-fight-global-poverty\">published a report</a> last week on the impact of building new coal power plants in countries where a large percentage of the population lacks access to electricity. The report\u2019s conclusions are strikingly counter-intuitive: on the whole, building coal power plants does little to help the poor, and often it can actually make them poorer.</p> <p>Delivering<em> electricity</em> to those in energy poverty is certainly important. For example, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/HAP_BoD_results_March2014.pdf?ua=1)\">household air pollution killed 4.3 million people</a> globally in 2012; many of those lives could be saved and health improved with the use of electric stoves to replace burning wood or charcoal. However, the question remains whether coal is the best way to deliver that electricity.</p> <h2><strong>More coal doesn\u2019t help people living close to the grid</strong></h2> <p>The report notes that approximately 15% of people in energy poverty live close to existing electric grids, but there are a variety of barriers blocking their connection. For example, the poor consume relatively little electricity, so the costs of connecting them may exceed the resulting profits. The power lines used to connect them also result in high energy losses and power system instability. The poor also have little political influence in many developing countries. As the report concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>This means that for energy-poor families living close to </em><em>the grid, building new power generation capacity \u2013 coalfired </em><em>or otherwise \u2013 will not help them get connected. </em><em>Instead, access will require financing the upfront costs of </em><em>new connections, and rationalising tariffs to reflect the true </em><em>costs of supplying power.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>More coal also doesn\u2019t help people in rural areas</strong></h2> <p>Approximately 84% of energy-poor households live in rural areas further away from the grid. For this group, decentralized stand-alone and mini-grid solutions are much quicker than waiting to build a new centralized power plant and distribution lines. A single power plant can take a decade between planning and ultimate completion, while distributed wind turbines or solar panels can be deployed much more rapidly, as Elon Musk explained in \u2018Before the Flood\u2019:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90CkXVF-Q8M\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/90CkXVF-Q8M?start=3471&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=3471\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Leonardo DiCaprio and Elon Musk discussing solar and battery technology deployment to developing countries, in <em>Before the Flood</em>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In fact, most planned coal development isn\u2019t aimed at delivering electricity to the poor. It\u2019s mostly targeted toward industrialized areas in China, which already have high levels of access to electricity. In India, many areas with the densest concentration of coal plants also have the lowest rates of electricity access. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6433eb01816a2734acb4652467c0757697ef68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6433eb01816a2734acb4652467c0757697ef68c/0_0_955_578/500.png\" alt=\"Planned coal energy deployment vs.population lacking access to electricity.\" width=\"500\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Planned coal energy deployment vs.population lacking access to electricity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Overseas Development Institute.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New coal plants aren\u2019t built for the poor because it\u2019s not profitable.</p> <h2><strong>China dramatically reduced poverty, but coal played only a small role</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a common misconception that China\u2019s coal power expansion lifted much of its population out of poverty. For example, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/opinion/the-poor-need-cheap-fossil-fuels.html\">according to Bjorn Lomborg</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Over the last 30 years, China moved an estimated 680 million people out of poverty by giving them access to modern energy, mostly powered by coal.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>However, as this new report notes, about two-thirds of China\u2019s reduction in extreme poverty occurred in the 1980s, before its dramatic expansion of coal power starting in the 1990s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64ee21be548a8cde510b5eccca32e435b7894090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64ee21be548a8cde510b5eccca32e435b7894090/0_0_846_561/500.png\" alt=\"Changes in Chinese poverty and coal energy deployment.\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changes in Chinese poverty and coal energy deployment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Overseas Development Institute.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More importantly, China enacted agricultural reform, which helped the profitability of small farms. China\u2019s hard push towards industrialization did rely on coal power, but it only happened after the agricultural reforms had lifted most of its population out of extreme poverty.</p> <h2><strong>Burning coal causes air, water, and carbon pollution</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s air pollution problems are an example of the consequences of relying too heavily on burning coal for generating electricity. The report notes that sickness and death caused by air pollution currently costs China an estimated 9.7% to 13.2% of its GDP annually. It currently causes some 670,000 premature deaths a year in China and 100,000 in India. Coal also requires substantial amounts of freshwater for operation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The coal industry withdraws, consumes </em><em>and pollutes substantial quantities of freshwater, often </em><em>competing for limited water resources with other sectors, </em><em>such as smallholder agriculture, that are crucial for poverty </em><em>reduction. </em><em>Roughly 44% of existing and planned coal </em><em>plants are located in areas with high to extremely high </em><em>water stress. </em><em> A quarter are located in \u2018red-listed\u2019 areas, </em><em>where surface and groundwater resources are at risk of </em><em>drying up because water is being withdrawn faster than it </em><em>can be replenished \u2026 </em><em>Coal plants\u2019 direct competition with poor farmers </em><em>for scarce water resources has already led to political </em><em>tensions and social unrest.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>And of course the more coal we burn, the more global warming will result. <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=15\">Poorer countries tend to be the most vulnerable</a> to the impacts of climate change. As the report notes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>By 2050, climate change impacts could draw an estimated 720 million people into extreme poverty </em><em>(Granoff et al., 2015). </em><em>This is about the same number </em><em>lifted out of extreme poverty in the last two decades and </em><em>would thus cancel out much of the progress made in </em><em>poverty eradication to date \u2026 </em><em>Coal expansion as currently planned is enough to </em><em>push climate change to catastrophic levels. A changing </em><em>climate already disproportionately hits the poorest people </em><em>with least resources to enable them to adapt.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Wind and solar are already becoming cheaper than coal</strong></h2> <p>Not only are wind and solar better for the poor in terms of ease of deployment, clean air, and slowing climate change, they\u2019ve also become cost-competitive. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>South Africa, for example, is the cheapest place in Africa </em><em>to generate coal-fired power, yet electricity from its new 4.7 </em><em>gigawatt Medupi advanced coal plant will </em><em>cost ... 17% </em><em>more than the electricity generated from South Africa\u2019s 2 </em><em>gigawatt of new onshore wind power. </em><em> In India, the minister </em><em>responsible for power development recently stated: \u2018I think </em><em>a new coal plant would give you costlier power than a solar </em><em>plant\u2019 (Climate Home, 2016). </em><em>The statement is supported by </em><em>the extremely low bid prices for recent solar procurements in </em><em>India (Kenning, 2015). </em><em> Renewable energy investment in the </em><em>emerging world now outpaces that in developed countries </em><em>(McGrath, 2016).</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Renewable energy also has low operating cost and zero fuel cost, while fossil fuel costs are variable and susceptible to price spikes. And renewable energy creates more (and safer) jobs than coal.</p> <p>Coal companies and their allies often argue that we need to burn their products to lift the poor out of poverty. For example, <a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.com/matt-ridley-africa-needs-to-be-rich-rather-than-green/\">Matt Ridley has claimed</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>those who advocate no support for coal are effectively saying that the adoption of renewable energy is more important than alleviating African poverty</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In reality, there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa\">better, faster, cleaner alternatives</a> to help deliver electricity to the energy-poor. Those who argue to the contrary often do so to advance their own agendas.<br> </p>",
  "<h2>1) Liverpool\u2019s wild ride towards a title challenge</h2> <p>The splurge of title-winning questions after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool\u2019s breathless victory at Selhurst Park</a> provoked a wonderfully enigmatic response from J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Can his team conquer the league playing in this wild fashion? \u201cI\u2019ve no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my first proper season in the Premier League. I have no idea what to do to win the Premier League. I\u2019m pretty sure it was never decided at the end of October. We feel good in the moment, that\u2019s all.\u201d The notion that an experienced manager with 15 years on the job \u2013 who won the Bundesliga twice and has spent more than a year in England to immerse himself in its foibles \u2013 has no idea how to win the Premier League seems to be both endearing and a shrewd ploy. Playing it all down is a sensible approach, but will be difficult to sustain the longer Liverpool keep gathering results in their own inimitable fashion. It was an emotional game. Dejan Lovren felt such a maddening anger after his error led towards one of the Palace goals he admitted he wanted to leap into the crowd (where the Palace hardcore hang out, incidentally) when he scored. The home goalscorer, James McArthur, said he felt gutted at the end of it all. Dealing with emotional games is part of the ride under Klopp. Entertaining? Absolutely. But the manager also says the way they play is rational. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it because we want to show something, we do it because it helps us, because the best kind of defending is keeping the ball,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s quite logical.\u201d <strong>Amy Lawrence</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Crystal Palace 2-4 Liverpool</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/30/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league\">Klopp teaches Liverpool the art of filling space dynamically</a></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/29/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-crystal-palace\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59q6n\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2853491\"            data-video-name=\"Liverpool's J\u00fcrgen Klopp: 'I am happy with the character of my boys' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581508a0e4b08d944ba4c0dc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161029JurgenKlopp_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846485&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846485&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/29/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-crystal-palace\">Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u2018I am happy with the character of my boys\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>2) Barkley delivering under Koeman\u2019s tough love</strong></h2> <p>The evidence of Ross Barkley\u2019s entire Everton career should caution against hyping the midfielder or inflating expectations until he produces performances like that against West Ham United on a regular basis, though Sunday was a welcome reminder of how valuable he can be to Ronald Koeman\u2019s designs at Goodison Park. Koeman has not been slow to criticise the England international in public this season but his contribution to Everton\u2019s first win in six matches, helping to create Romelu Lukaku\u2019s latest goal against West Ham and scoring the second himself in a more composed yet decisive display, underlined why the coach is so demanding of a player in a key role. Everton\u2019s front three behind Lukaku has lacked \u201cproductivity\u201d, according to Koeman, who may well seek to strengthen in that department in future transfer windows. Whether Wayne Rooney fits that criterion remains to be seen, although it seems fanciful that the boyhood Evertonian\u2019s advisers would consider the substantial pay decrease needed to facilitate a return. Koeman has done nothing to dismiss the prospect \u2013 \u201cRooney is very welcome at Everton,\u201d he reiterated on Sunday \u2013 but if the tactic is to inspire a response from Barkley then so far so good.<strong> Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/everton-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Everton 2-0 West Ham</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/31/everton-to-pay-staff-living-wage\">Everton set to pay all staff living wage</a></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/30/second-half-confidence-everton-manager-ronald-koeman\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a2n3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2856117\"            data-video-name=\"Second half confidence was 'the difference' says Everton manager Ronald Koeman \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58163018e4b0219a00d3a58a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030EvertonWestHamReactions_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/30/161030EvertonWestHamReactions.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/30/161030EvertonWestHamReactions_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/30/second-half-confidence-everton-manager-ronald-koeman\">Second half confidence was \u2018the difference\u2019 says Everton manager Ronald Koeman</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>3) Rashford must take centre stage for United</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/oct/30/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan was again conspicuous by his absence from the matchday squad, as was any semblance of the wing play that used to be a Manchester United tradition.

Aitor Karanka\u2019s side had to merely turn up in the Championship last season \u2013 taking 16 wins from 23 home games \u2013 but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/middlesbrough-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">until beating Bournemouth on Saturday</a>, Boro had found home comforts anything but advantageous in the top flight. It was two unlikely lads, in many ways, Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez and Adama Traor\u00e9, who helped Boro to a first home win of the season. Ram\u00edrez arrived at Southampton from Bologna in 2012, yet only now is the Uruguayan beginning to feel at home in England. Traor\u00e9, meanwhile, is slowly reaping the rewards of a fresh start in the north-east after enduring relegation with Aston Villa last term. If the flair of Ram\u00edrez and Traor\u00e9, the 20-year-old former Barcelona B winger, can blossom in the north-east behind the often isolated \u00c1lvaro Negredo, then Karanka\u2019s prospects of coaching Boro in the Premier League again next season will prove significantly enhanced. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/middlesbrough-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Middlesbrough 2-0 Bournemouth</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/28/gaston-ramirez-middlesbrough-lifeline\">Talisman Ram\u00edrez is Middlesbrough\u2019s man for all seasons</a></li> </ul> <h2>5) Moses finally finding his feet at Chelsea</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/30/chelsea-antonio-conte-eden-hazard-diego-costa-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a37h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2856428\"            data-video-name=\"Chelsea's Antonio Conte has high praise for goalscorers Hazard and Costa \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5816512ee4b08d944ba4c5b0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030ChelseaPresser_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/30/161030ChelseaPresser.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/30/161030ChelseaPresser_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/30/chelsea-antonio-conte-eden-hazard-diego-costa-video\">Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte has high praise for goalscorers Hazard and Costa</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In two weeks, Antonio Conte has gone from laughing off rumours of the sack to clearing a space on his shelf for a Manager of the Month award. October has brought four league wins, 11 goals and none conceded. If things have moved fast for the Chelsea boss, it\u2019s a different story for Victor Moses, who has waited four years to become an overnight success at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea\u2019s upturn in form has coincided neatly with Conte\u2019s switch to a back three of Gary Cahill, David Luiz and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta. On paper, it doesn\u2019t scream solidity, but the results speak for themselves. Amid the mayhem at West Ham, a back three shorn of the protection offered by Moses and Marcos Alonso at wing-back (and with John Terry shoehorned into it) looked far less secure. Moses didn\u2019t feature on Wednesday, but has started each of the four league wins, and has earned repeated praise from Conte for his attitude and adaptability. Wingers on defensive duty are rarely as disciplined and assured as Moses was at St. Mary\u2019s \u2013 dropping into a back five to repel Southampton in the first half, hugging the touchline to bypass the hosts\u2019 narrow midfield, and getting upfield to set up Eden Hazard\u2019s opener. It has been a long time coming, but Moses may have found his place in what looks a formidable Chelsea team.<strong> Niall McVeigh</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/southampton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Southampton 0-2 Chelsea</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/30/antonio-conte-adaptability-helping-chelsea-side-prosper\">Conte\u2019s adaptability is helping his Chelsea side to prosper</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/chelsea-antonio-conte-premier-league-title\">Conte cautious on title chances after Chelsea extend winning run</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd6480b97df5f087bbd727fff3e82aca495c0055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd6480b97df5f087bbd727fff3e82aca495c0055/0_111_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Moses looks a player reborn at Chelsea under Antonio Conte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Moses looks a player reborn at Chelsea under Antonio Conte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Moyes unable to boost Wearside weariness</h2> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger did not mean to be patronising but he sounded it. \u201cI feel pity for him,\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager said when asked to reflect on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/david-moyes-sunderland-arsenal-worst-start-premier-league-season\">Sunderland\u2019s collection of two points</a> from the first 10 Premier League games of David Moyes\u2019s tenure. Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner, has no appetite to sack the club\u2019s seventh manager in five years but, should Moyes\u2019s team stumble in their next two fixtures \u2013 at Bournemouth and home against Hull City \u2013 the Wearside crowd may ensure his position simply becomes untenable. That would be a shame as, in many respects, he seems Sunderland\u2019s most impressive coach in years. Certainly no one should question Moyes\u2019s integrity or industry. Short\u2019s best policy would be to swallow the pain of relegation and allow him to rebuild in the Championship a l\u00e1 Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Newcastle but reality dictates a manager can take only so many defeats before being mortally wounded. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/sunderland-arsenal-premier-league-match-report-olivier-giroud-alexis-sanchez\">Match report: Sunderland 1-4 Arsenal</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/david-moyes-einstein-barry-glendenning\">Barry Glendenning: Sunderland escape act will be little short of a miracle</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/david-moyes-sunderland-arsenal-worst-start-premier-league-season\">Moyes refuses to panic despite record-equalling nadir</a></li> </ul> <h2>7) Musa puts body on the line to make mark</h2> <p>On the ropes after conceding to Vincent Janssen\u2019s penalty on the stroke of half-time, Leicester City\u2019s renewed togetherness was encapsulated by the commitment Ahmed Musa displayed when he scored the equaliser that earned them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/tottenham-hotspur-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">their first away point of the season</a>. Musa put his body on the line when he met Jamie Vardy\u2019s cross and although he avoided a serious injury, the winger was eventually substituted. \u201cHe goes without fear of the tackle to score the goal,\u201d Claudio Ranieri said. Leicester\u2019s manager is hopeful Musa will be fit for the trip to FC Copenhagen on Wednesday. They could certainly do with him being available. The Nigerian is beginning to enjoy playing for the champions after moving from CSKA Moscow. \u201cI want Musa to understand the spirit of the Premier League and now he\u2019s getting better,\u201d Ranieri said. Musa, with two goals in two games, looks like a smart signing. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/tottenham-hotspur-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Leicester City</a><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/30/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-leicester-city\">Pochettino needs Spurs\u2019 creative players to join hunt for goals</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7c98c9b222e3607cb7c06cb784aa87f7fec2c0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c98c9b222e3607cb7c06cb784aa87f7fec2c0d/0_112_4646_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmed Musa puts his body on the line to equalise for Leicester at Tottenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmed Musa puts his body on the line to equalise for Leicester at Tottenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/30/mauricio-pochettino-tottenham-leicester-city\">Mauricio Pochettino needs Spurs\u2019 creative players to join hunt for goals</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8) Phelan must draw on experience amid hard times</h2> <p>Despite all that success as Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s right-hand man at Old Trafford, Mike Phelan has not always had it easy. No longer required as Stockport assistant when Gary Megson was sacked in 1999, the former midfielder ended up joining United\u2019s academy and had to wait two years for his chance with the first team. Almost two decades later, Phelan is back in the real world of the Premier League\u2019s basement boys having seen his side pick up one point since the end of August. \u201cYou get used to winning after being involved in it for 19 years, of course you do,\u201d he said after the latest defeat, against Watford. \u201cBut you understand that while I have been at other end and winning, there are others who have lost along the way. I have to accept that is part of the game.\u201d Hull could count themselves unfortunate after Michael Dawson\u2019s late own goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/watford-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">handed Watford the points</a> following some dogged defending by the visitors. But Phelan knows he will need his fair share of luck to ensure they do not return from whence they came in May. \u201cI have stepped up to this role now in difficult circumstances,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cI have to stress that. Those circumstances are always around but we have to deal with it \u2013 we are in the big league where things have to develop fast. But we are newly promoted. We are on a losing spell but we have to stick together and keep working at it.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/watford-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Watford 1-0 Hull City</a><br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8363140ab01fd20dada280082b35366f0cf37e86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8363140ab01fd20dada280082b35366f0cf37e86/783_3_2170_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Phelan consoles Ahmed Elmohamady and Jarrod Bowen after the narrow defeat to Watford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Phelan consoles Ahmed Elmohamady and Jarrod Bowen after the narrow defeat to Watford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) What can make Ag\u00fcero even better?</h2> <p>In Pep Guardiola\u2019s ideal world, Sergio Ag\u00fcero would be a little more aggressive. The Argentina striker is too nice, according to his manager, and because of that needs to do more to convince people he is among the world\u2019s best. \u201cIn the box he\u2019s in that level with the best,\u201d Guardiola said when asked where he ranks after he scored twice and provided an assist to end City\u2019s six\u2011match winless run. Scarily for opposing defenders, the Manchester City manager also reckons \u201ca club legend\u201d could have a bit more self\u2011belief. \u201cHe has to convince because he is one of the nicest players I\u2019ve trained in my career.

His two goals against Sunderland on Saturday were very \u2018centre-forward\u2019 goals: one a towering header (and Lamine Kon\u00e9 might want to reflect on how a man seven inches shorter than him managed to tower so) and the other a snaffled finish of an expert poacher. It was as if he decided: \u201cWell, if I\u2019m a centre-forward, I had better start acting like one.\u201d Those two strikes were his seventh and eighth of the season (his 49th and 50th for the club), and his move to this new position has been one of the triumphs of the campaign so far, after a summer in which most people believed Arsenal needed another centre-forward. As it turned out that was true, it\u2019s just that, as Wenger often says, buying another one wasn\u2019t necessarily the answer. What\u2019s also encouraging for Arsenal\u2019s prospects this season is that now S\u00e1nchez represents Plan A, Olivier Giroud becomes the Plan B that he should probably always have represented. Options, depth and ruthless attacking: Arsenal look like a serious force this season.<strong> Nick Miller</strong></p> <ul> <li><a

And no one appears to much care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/worst-times-butterfly-butterflywatch\">Worst of times for the butterfly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, allow me to entertain the idea of a post-animal Britain. Could we make the best of this world, in true Theresa May fashion? Are animals, perhaps, all a bit overrated? Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad?</p> <p>Sure, there would be some tough choices at first. One particularly pressing matter would be finding a way to cross-pollinate flowering crops. As is well known, trees and insects co-evolved, the plants offering a sugary reward to insects in return for their pollination services. How might we achieve this without bees and flies? Simple. The problem of cross-fertilisation could quite simply be solved by robots or people on day release from jail (or even children who don\u2019t get into grammar schools). They could be made to hand-fertilise flowers. They could be like little unthinking bees.</p> <p>Indeed, hand-fertilisation is already <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand\" title=\"\">common practice in some parts of the world</a>, where invertebrate populations have already been ravaged. Think of the savings of such a plan! Robots don\u2019t need sugary water produced by plants, after all. They run on cheap oil and gas, which there\u2019s plenty of, forever. Without invertebrates, everyone wins, right?</p> <p>More seriously, there could be other benefits. Think of climate change. Global emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> would be greatly reduced without them, seeing that the gas that sprouts forth from farm animals accounts for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/26/greenhouse-gas-emissions-livestock\" title=\"\">15% of human-caused global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a>. So that would be good. We won\u2019t even miss the farm animals either, since it seems increasingly likely that we will be 3D printing our dinners in the future.

Pets can go. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/13/ethical-living-carbon-emissions\" title=\"\">contribute to global emissions</a> as well. If we were to get rid of them, within two generations the very notion of having a pet would probably end up being absurd. The very idea that some houses had cats that would warm a person\u2019s lap while they watched Netflix could seem almost perverted to our great-great-grandchildren whose idea of having a meaningful relationship with an animal would, by then, involve tossing 35 <a href=\"http://www.t3.com/news/pok-mon-go-fans-now-you-can-get-a-real-working-pok-ball-that-doubles-as-a-charger\" title=\"\">Pok\u00e9balls</a> at an imaginary one while sitting on the toilet.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all rosy, however. I\u2019m the first to admit that there would be problems in a post-animal world. Sure, green algal blooms would cover the entire face of the planet \u2013 most of the land and sea \u2013 and all plants would remain uncropped and there would be the stench of scavenging fungus which would come to fill the niche left by Earth\u2019s animal decomposers. But we can handle a bit of a whiff or maybe get a man in to fix this for us or something. Oh, and the crops wouldn\u2019t grow because there would be no worms to oxygenate the soil. And the soil communities \u2013 tiny nematode worms and mites \u2013 would die so the soil would essentially be dead and likely to blow away, being completely unsuitable for any forms of crops. But \u2026 let\u2019s not get bogged down in the details, OK? Again, children and robots can probably fill this role. It\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>For there is another bonus to living in a world without animals. It is simple. Imagine the ego-boost that would come from being the only animals to survive a mass extinction event. Imagine being the pinch point. You and me. We could be the masters of a mass extinction so enormous that all future life on Earth might be a descendent of us. Imagine, in 50m years, little rat humans and little pig humans and little humans that feast upon wetland grasses poisoned by a film of toxic bacteria. Imagine little fungus-eating humans, gorging upon the silent forests of stinking colourless mushrooms that thrive on rotting, uneaten trees. Imagine little cat humans that can warm your lap while watching Netflix. That sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? We could be surrounded by animals shaped in our own image. We could be gods, essentially.</p> <p>It may sound surreal, but conservationists, I believe, imagine this world quite a bit. They consider this human world, and what it would be like without animals in it. A silent world where it\u2019s all about us and what industry can do \u2013 where there\u2019s no escape from humanity. A world where the only sounds are human-made and the only colours are factory-made is not an Earthly place, to me at least.</p> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s time, finally, that we started considering the worst if only for a few moments every now and then. Perhaps it will make us listen that bit harder the next time statistics like these are published by conservationists. Because this is a real decline. This is a real trend. This is what mass extinctions look like from the inside. An animal world becoming less animal by the day. So, which world do you like best: ours or theirs?</p>",

  "<p>It is obviously more than a game and this documentary directed by Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani \u2013 and exec-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 showing on Netflix, brings a new urgency to an old subject: the ivory trade, which is threatening the world\u2019s elephants. This threat has not been cancelled or brought under control, as I had assumed. The film persuasively argues that it is all but out of control: so much so that elephants are in danger of being wiped out in the wild in just a matter of years. One of the biggest mammals on Earth might vanish. And the market forces driving the trade stem from just one country: China, where there is a huge appetite for luxury goods made of ivory. Well-organised criminal gangs poach the elephants, and get the ivory in container ships to China via south east Asia: the Vietnamese connection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/world-on-track-to-lose-two-thirds-of-wild-animals-by-2020-major-report-warns\">World on track to lose two-thirds of wild animals by 2020, major report warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the most grisly way, the well-publicised extinction threat and outrage are themselves creating the luxury cachet and driving up the price, encouraging the market which in turn worsens the danger still further. With elephants in such dire straits, competing poachers and illicit buyers know not just that they can make a fortune, but that there is only a short period of time in which to do it. The price rises all the time, and the window of opportunity is closing as well. They are in an extinction race to the bottom. And if elephants disappear in the wild, these same market forces in luxury goods mean that other species will be in danger too: the rhino, the giraffe, the lion. We are wearing down the fabric of biodiversity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"174aeab4f7d05459a51eb0be072096a429ad880d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/174aeab4f7d05459a51eb0be072096a429ad880d/163_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ivory Game film still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The awful truth appears to be that the Chinese government has legitimised and stimulated this trade by creating a notional legal \u201callowance\u201d for domestic consumption of ivory, which naturally only encourages the black marketers to use this supposed legality to launder their mountains of illicit material. Any artefact, any brutally severed tusk, can always be claimed to come under the \u201clegal\u201d umbrella. An anti-poaching campaigner says: \u201cOne person holds in his hands the fate of elephants: the president of China. I think it is the first time in history that one person has in his hands the destiny of an entire species.\u201d An observer is entitled to wonder if this situation is being helped by any possible state corruption in Africa. Investigating that isn\u2019t the point of the film. But China\u2019s huge semi-legalised ivory hunger is certainly the driving force.</p> <p>The film is perhaps a little too excitable and enamoured of its own narc-thriller style, with mannerisms that reminded me of Paul Greengrass or Michael Mann: particularly the scenes of Swat-type attacks and dramatic overhead shots of cars moving swiftly across open country. After a while, I felt that any time the film spends not demanding to speak to the Chinese president is a waste of time. But maybe the more realistic solution is not to focus on China, but on stronger protective action on the supply side, in Africa. In any event: a committed, valuable film.</p> <p>\u2022 The Ivory Game premieres on Netflix on 4 November.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GPEKKaSmZY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3GPEKKaSmZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GPEKKaSmZY\">Watch the trailer for The Ivory Game \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>",

  "<p>The size of the deficit in defined benefit pension schemes dropped sharply in October, according to a report on Monday.</p> <p>The total deficit in the UK\u2019s 6,000 defined benefit funds improved by \u00a360bn to \u00a3630bn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/01/uk-defined-benefit-pension-fund-deficit-grows-100bn-one-month-pwc\">down from the record high of \u00a3710bn in August</a>, said the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The improvement followed a recent rise in yields on gilts, or government bonds. But Raj Mody, PwC\u2019s global head of pensions, said: \u201cSlight improvements in gilt yields have contributed to the apparent deficit reduction, but liability measurement by gilt yields does not necessarily represent reality, given pension liabilities are mainly affected by longevity and inflation.\u201d</p> <p>PwC has called for a review of how pension deficits are repaired and how pension investment strategies are formulated. It said most funds expected to reduce their deficits within 10 years, but 15 years may be more realistic.</p> <p>The rise in gilt yields, which means the value of gilts are falling, follows investor concerns about the outlook for the UK economy post-Brexit. So far it has been a mixed picture, with the economy holding up reasonably well. </p> <p>But Brexit was the biggest reason for companies issuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/profit-warnings\">profit warnings</a> in the third quarter, according to consultancy group EY.</p> <p>It said UK quoted companies issued 68 profit warnings in the third quarter 2016, two more than the previous three months but 11 fewer than the same period in 2015. Twenty of the warnings blamed the fallout from the EU referendum vote, but EY said that overall the initial Brexit impact had been mixed and the negative effects were focused on sectors most exposed to business uncertainty and the weaker pound. <strong> </strong></p> <p>Alan Hudson, EY\u2019s head of restructuring for UK and Ireland, said: \u201cCompanies are contending with a daunting level of uncertainty. Last summer it was the falling oil price and worries about growth and US interest rates that dominated. This summer it was the fallout from Brexit. Meanwhile, companies are still facing competitive and disruptive forces in their own markets. </p> <p>\u201cFor most companies it has been business as usual and for some, the falling pound has been a help rather than hindrance.

  "<p>Immigration is likely to remain an overarching theme in European politics. And for a long time yet. It was at the heart of the UK referendum campaign (although this concerned mostly intra-EU migration), and it is set to dominate French and German elections next year (focusing on immigration from outside Europe). In the summer of 2015 <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/merkel-says-migrants-bigger-challenge-eu-greek-debt-181432878.html?ref=gs\">Angela Merkel predicted</a> that migration and asylum would \u201cin the future preoccupy\u201d Europe \u201cmuch, much more\u201d than financial issues have done.

Europe may have closed off the Aegean and Balkan routes, but more people are drowning than ever before in the central Mediterranean desperately trying to reach Italy.</p> <p>The migration issue has shaped political discourse in Europe, and is likely to continue to shape it. On one side are liberal internationalists attached to fundamental asylum principles or to the dream of a borderless world; on the other are xenophobic fence-builders who see migration as a modern version of barbaric invasions threatening culture and civilisation. The latter, alas, tend to hold sway.</p> <p>One of the collateral damages of post-truth politics is that not only the present gets distorted \u2013 the past gets rewritten as well. Racist videos online depict fantasies of Europe \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d migration. \u201cBefore\u201d is depicted with orderly scenes of 1950s streets, shops and parks where an all-white population strolls or plays happily. \u201cAfter\u201d is groups of dark-faced men attacking women, rioting against the police, shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d.</p> <p>The essential narrative of bigots is that our European world is collapsing under the onslaught of mass arrivals from cultures that we cannot possibly mingle with. In France, a theory called the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11323557/Enfant-terribles-literary-vision-of-an-Islamic-France.html\">great replacement</a>\u201d has spread to large parts of the right and certainly the far-right. It states that, as a result of immigration, the nation\u2019s core population is set to be replaced by non-European outsiders who will wreck the country\u2019s identity. There are also echoes of this in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/pegida-germany-anti-immigrant-group-polarising-dresden\">Germany\u2019s Pegida movement,</a> whose full name is \u201cPatriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the west\u201d.</p> <p>Debunking these myths can be hard work. Hatred and passions overtake rational approaches and documented facts get swept away. It is even harder when Europe\u2019s long history of almost constant population movement and mixing of cultures is ignored, untaught or forgotten. For example, it\u2019s often said that the arrival of Arabs and Muslims in France started when post-second world war reconstruction efforts required a new labour force, or after Algeria became independent in 1962. Yet Algerians (especially from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabylie\">Kabylie</a>) have been in France for at least a century. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/world/europe/a-life-spent-remembering-a-war-france-has-tried-to-forget.html?_r=0\">French historian Benjamin Stora</a> says the real challenge of immigration is \u201cthe challenge of knowing the other\u201d \u2013 and it goes both ways.</p> <p>The 2015 refugee crisis has held up a mirror to Europeans: it\u2019s forced them to ask themselves who they are, how they define themselves and their actions. The <a href=\"http://time.com/4434720/1-3-million-migrants-2015-pew/\">1.3 million people</a> who reached the continent last year represented only <a href=\"http://www.stand.ie/refugee-crisis-are-the-numbers-really-that-big/\">0.2% of the EU\u2019s total population</a>. It should have been manageable. Germany alone took in roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/20/germany-raises-estimate-refugee-arrivals-800000\">800,000</a>. That\u2019s equivalent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/aug/20/asylum-seekers-eu-comparison-germany-datablog\">1% of its own population</a>, and is the same number it absorbed in 1992 when people fled the Balkan wars and ethnic Germans left the former Soviet Union..</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bigots claim that Europe is collapsing under mass arrivals from cultures we cannot possibly mingle with</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If there was a crisis in 2015, it had less to do with the refugees \u2013 who knew what they were fleeing and where they wanted to go \u2013 and much more to do more with European governments and societies who did not all step up to the plate. In fact, Europe isn\u2019t confronted with a refugee and migrant crisis. It\u2019s the refugees and migrants who are confronted with a crisis of Europe. The scandal is that, in the Mediterranean, they have been paying with their lives.</p> <p>Demographers point out that the pivotal migration year for Europe was 2014. That\u2019s when <a href=\"http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/colloque-2016/symposium-2016-10-14-14h30.htm\">Europe for the first time surpassed the US as a destination for immigrants, according to the French demographer Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9ran</a>. Around <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics\">1.9 million legal immigrants</a> came to the EU (population 508 million) and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/06/us/immigration-statistics-fast-facts/\">1 million to the US</a> (population 319 million). With that, the European ratio became 3.7 legal immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants, while the US\u2019s was 3.1. This is the new, transformative reality many Europeans have yet to acknowledge.</p> <p>Historically, Europe exported its population, whether to distant colonial possessions for conquest and domination, or to the New World as a consequence of poverty, persecution or war. Now, it has become the foremost magnet and refuge for those who seek safety and a better life. We are simply much richer and more stable than many other parts of the world.</p> <p>And our diversity is set to grow, but not in the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d scenario. Europe needs immigration as an injection of youth and dynamism if in the decades to come it wants to address its workforce and pension problems.</p> <p>Europeans were once the huddled masses on boats reaching Ellis Island, in New York, or <a href=\"http://www.pier21.ca/home/\">Pier 21 in Halifax</a>, Canada\u2019s gateway for immigrants \u2013 both now museums.

Perhaps other European politicians should too.</p> <p>Canada and the US are countries whose creation derived from the movement of people to faraway shores; European nations are rooted otherwise. But Europe could draw inspiration from the capacity to form a positive narrative that embraces migration instead of treating it mainly as a threat. Europe, as the new continent of immigration, will increasingly need that narrative.</p>",
  "<p> Projecting the no-nonsense aura obligatory for all hard-pressed headmasters, Sher Ahmed Afghan favours a prompt 7.45am start to assembly at the Wesa Academy in Kandahar.

The school, which educates girls up to the age of 14, and boys up to 18, is so inundated with demand for places that it opened a nearby feeder nursery in September.

In 2015, <a href=\"http://unama.unmissions.org/education-and-healthcare-risk-children-afghanistan\">UN officials documented</a> 132 conflict-related incidents affecting education, an 86% increase compared with the previous year. In August, militants launched an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/27/american-university-afghanistan-survivors\">attack on the American University of Afghanistan</a> in Kabul, an oasis of liberal values, killing at least 16 people and wounding scores of others. A fortnight earlier, two lecturers at the university \u2013 an Australian and an American \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/american-australian-kidnapped-afghanistan-kabul-160808102236525.html\">were kidnapped by men dressed in police uniforms</a>. Security officials said they suspected the abduction was the work of a ransom-seeking criminal gang. </p> <p> While Kandaharis say their city feels more secure these days, other problems continue to cause grave concern. For example, the city still has extremely high rates of maternal and infant mortality. Educators say the private grief gripping so many families has contributed to the broader embrace of girls\u2019 education by persuading male family heads of the importance of female doctors. </p> <p>At Wesa, Rihana, 14, wearing a red prefect\u2019s sash and a badge announcing her status as headgirl, nurses an ambition \u2013 shared by many of her peers \u2013 to study medicine. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many female doctors \u2013 that\u2019s why we want to be doctors,\u201d she says.</p> <p> At Kandahar\u2019s government-run Malalai high school for girls, teachers report a similar pattern, saying many more pupils now aim to pursue higher education. \u201cThree years ago, we didn\u2019t have so many who wanted to go to university,\u201d says the principal, Anahita Rahimi. \u201cWe\u2019re convincing families to let them continue with their studies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d62814e27988c5cc2964d25a055b0052e1500b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d62814e27988c5cc2964d25a055b0052e1500b31/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A father and son walk in the centre of Kandahar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A father and son walk in central Kandahar.

Of 1,346 students studying at Kandahar\u2019s teacher training institute, 321 were girls, their report found.</p> <p> Illustrating the divisions in many families, Fazal Ahmad, a shopkeeper, says he is determined to keep his daughter in school. He laments a decision by his brother to withdraw his own 14-year-old daughter out of a combination of fear that she might be caught up in an insurgent attack and reluctance to defy more conservative elders. </p> <p> \u201cThere are many people who are under pressure not to send their daughters to school, but they are sending them anyway,\u201d says Ahmad. \u201cI\u2019m sure things are starting to change.\u201d</p> <p> As attitudes slowly evolve, the spirit of the pioneers at Wesa Academy is captured by a motto emblazoned in red, black and green on a sign taped to a classroom wall: \u201cNever give up.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Cities around the world confront a huge and pressing problem: how do you accommodate growing numbers of people? It is forecast that by 2050, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">two-thirds</a> of the world\u2019s population will live in urban areas, and transport planners face the daunting task of making sure everyone can move around without too much of a struggle.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s population is expected to grow by almost 10 million over the next 25 years \u2013 London\u2019s population could reach 9.8 million by 2025. Since many of our cities already suffer from overcrowding on trains, congestion on roads and worsening air pollution, there is an urgent need to find new ways to adapt to the demographic changes.</p> <p>How will our transport systems cope? How might we best utilise new technologies to make our journeys more productive and less polluting? The Guardian, supported by Heathrow, recently hosted a roundtable discussion to address some of these issues.</p> <p>While the scale of the challenge is formidable, there is optimism cities can handle peak populations and even be made more liveable, the roundtable heard. \u201cTransport is a force for change,\u201d said Susan Claris, associate director at Arup, the engineering, planning and design firm. \u201cIt can help shape better cities, and make them more socially inclusive.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the experts on the panel identified the humble car as holding huge potential for a more efficient transport system. \u201cCars are amazingly efficient vehicles when they have four or five people in them, and we should be doing more to encourage more efficient use,\u201d said Ali Clabburn, CEO of Liftshare, a social enterprise offering commuters the chance to organise shared car journeys. \u201cAt peak hours, every train or bus is full, and there are millions of empty [car] seats on the road. It\u2019s a crazy situation,\u201d she added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/14/hyperloop-elon-musk-futuristic-technology-transport\">Hyperloop and our misplaced love of futuristic technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also greater potential for shared ownership of cars, according to Martin Uhlarik, Tata Motors\u2019 UK head of design. \u201cThe shared economy opens up the potential for people to share the product and use [each car] three or four times as much,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Self-driving cars</h2> <p>Uhlarik believes advances in self-driving technology could change the nature of long car commutes. \u201cAutonomous vehicles will be arriving,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once they come, we might still spend two hours in traffic, but it\u2019s a chance to question how you are spending that quality time. Are you working? Are you entertaining yourself? It might be about managing your time better.\u201d</p> <p>Working life in Britain today still revolves, largely, around a nine-to-five schedule. Debra Charles, CEO of smartcard company Novacroft, would like to see business and government get behind a major programme to promote flexible working, leading to fewer peak time journeys. \u201cWe\u2019ve got flexible working to some degree in the UK, but what if that was better incentivised? The rigidness of the way people work \u2013 if we could change that it would make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Shifting the nature of short journeys will also be vital. A recent report by the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/health/health-publications/health-impacts-cars-london\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greater London Authority</a> found that more than one third of all car trips in the capital are less than 2km, and could be walked in 25 minutes or less. The same report shows 2.7m daily car trips in London could be cycled. Getting people out of their cars and walking or cycling could boost health and reduce congestion.</p> <p>Many cities have made bold moves to encourage active lifestyles. Both New York and Paris have made efforts to repurpose parking spots for walking, biking, and public space. In Copenhagen, pedestrianising shopping streets and raising parking prices has seen the proportion of people driving to work <a href=\"http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_pub2/pdf/682_x8IQDnzcpQ.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fall from 22% to 16% (pdf)</a>. Claris would like to see more trials run by local authorities in the UK to assess the benefits of pedestrianisation. \u201cIf you make cities more pleasant to walk around in, then even the most reluctant walkers will think, \u2018It\u2019s not actually so bad,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Tom Cohen, deputy director of the UCL Transport Institute, agreed. \u201cPeople are dying because of inactivity. Whatever we might say about the future of transport in cities, it has to incorporate physically active travel.\u201d</p> <h2>Cutting unnecessary road trips</h2> <p>Some business leaders on the panel believe commuters can be usefully nudged into streamlined routines to cut down on unnecessary road trips. Parcel service Doddle, for instance, offers commuters the chance to pick up their online orders from its stores in train stations, saving delivery vans from making so many repeated trips to customers\u2019 doors when they\u2019re out at work. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to change behaviour, it\u2019s about how intuitive and accessible you make things for people,\u201d said Tim Robinson, Doddle\u2019s CEO.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/03/electric-rickshaws-tuk-city-uber-zero-emission-taxi\">Getting around the city: why electric rickshaws are the tuk of the town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rail commuters are already getting their grocery shopping done at major station supermarkets on their way home, and some are also choosing to hold business meetings at station restaurants and cafes. Tim Hedley-Jones, major projects director for Virgin Trains East Coast, said larger train stations are becoming \u201cthe focus of their community\u201d.</p> <p>Hedley-Jones also said the UK could alter planning policy to make better use of the \u201chuge quantities\u201d of brownfield land near train stations. \u201cIf you can give people good quality housing next to good quality public transport, then you can start to break the cycle of car dependency for short journeys.\u201d</p> <p>There remains, however, the almighty task of making sure public transport is ready to cope with increased passenger numbers. Despite major infrastructure projects such as HS2, Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2, Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London, said even more capacity was needed in the south east, particularly across south London. \u201cIn London, we have a world class transport system, but it\u2019s still not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get more people in our underground systems, we need to think about tram systems, and getting it all joined up with the National Rail network in a much better way.\u201d</p> <p>John Holland-Kaye, CEO of Heathrow, which is waiting for parliamentary approval for its third runway, said his airport is experimenting to make sure increasing passenger numbers does not mean more congestion. There are improved links to public transport, a large staff car-sharing scheme, and driverless pods that carry people to Terminal 5. \u201cWe can pioneer with some of these things, make them happen, and hopefully develop models that can be applied elsewhere,\u201d said Holland-Kaye.</p> <p>If some major, energy-intensive engineering works are inevitable, there are high hopes new ways of sharing data can make the transport system as sustainable and efficient as possible.</p> <h2>Making better use of data</h2> <p>In Bristol, the city council has developed a web-based service, the Bristol API, that allows any developer to connect their app to existing transport data: route maps, live train and bus times, and car park occupancy. \u201cOnce you build transport infrastructure, it just gets full again, quickly,\u201d said Stephen Hilton, Bristol city council\u2019s futures director. \u201cSo the real challenge is about trying to use every bit of spare capacity within the infrastructure that\u2019s not being used effectively.\u201d<br></p> <p>Data might also be better used to give walkers and cyclists the chance to choose the least health-harming journeys.

  "<p>Nissan was convinced to stay in the UK with a promise of no tariffs or extra bureaucratic burdens on the car industry after Brexit, the business secretary has finally revealed, prompting fears that sector-by-sector deals could cost the taxpayer \u201ccolossal amounts of money\u201d.</p> <p>Greg Clark caved in after four days of pressure in an interview on Sunday to reveal some details of how the government convinced the Japanese manufacturer to produce a fleet of new vehicles at its Sunderland plant. The Tory minister said he wrote to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan\">Nissan</a> with a series of four assurances as he went \u201call out\u201d to allay concerns about Brexit, promising that the government was confident of securing a deal that would keep the car industry competitive.</p> <p>\u201cOur intention, our negotiating remit, when it comes to the discussions with our European partners, is to have a constructive dialogue and look for the common interest here,\u201d Clark told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cOur objective would be to ensure we have continued access to the markets in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments, and that is how we will approach those negotiations.\u201d He suggested that this applied to the car industry in general and possibly to other major sectors of UK business.</p> <p>That suggests No 10 is seeking a free trade relationship for the automotive industry that at least brings benefits similar to membership of the single market and customs union. Theresa May has however said she wants greater immigration controls and freedom from the oversight of the European court of justice \u2013 a combination that Brussels politicians have repeatedly said is unachievable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a2vk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2855513\"            data-video-name=\"UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5815efc6e4b0219a00d3a47f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030MarrClark_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\">UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The admission prompted questions about the financial cost of protecting the industry from the impact of Brexit.

The letter contained promises of a continuation of funds for training, skills and scientific research, and regional relocation grants.</p> <p>In his letter to Clark, Clegg said the news that Nissan was staying was welcome, but questioned whether the assurances were \u201cpart of a planned strategy with a desired endpoint or a one-off concession which shows those that shout the loudest get the best deal from ministers\u201d.</p> <p>Clegg, who is playing a leading role in the Open Britain campaign group, called for more clarity on what it meant for No 10\u2019s wider Brexit strategy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/greg-clark-brexit-negotiations-andrew-marr-show-nissan-auto-industry\">Greg Clark's big reveal on 'demeanour' of Brexit negotiations strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAny assurances given about our future relationship with the customs union and the single market would go to the very heart of the Brexit negotiations, revealing whether the government is intending to stay within either, or whether you intend to negotiate a patchwork of carve-outs, subsidies and sectoral arrangements, which will create winners and losers and may cost the taxpayer colossal amounts of money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview led to further criticism that the government had been telling industry more about No 10\u2019s negotiating aims than the UK electorate. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cWhile we welcome the commitment to securing tariff-free trade for the automotive sector, Greg Clark has raised more questions than he\u2019s answered.

It\u2019s time for the government to enact a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956\">clean air act</a> to tackle this modern pollution problem and protect all our health.\u201d</p> <p>In the report, Unicef urges all countries to cut air pollution by reducing fossil fuel burning in power plants and vehicles, which also helps tackle climate change. This double benefit has led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/china-coal-peak-hailed-turning-point-climate-change-battle\">significant action in China</a> in recent years.

  "<p>This weekend\u2019s news of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">renewed FBI interest</a> in a newly found cache of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails is just the latest twist in this long, strange trip to the White House. For months now, Hillary Clinton has seemed destined to become the next President of the United States. </p> <p>In recent weeks Trump\u2019s campaign has been in free fall and he remains well behind Clinton in the \u201cground game\u201d, the voter turnout operation so important in American electoral politics. Yet Trump has made a habit of defying predictions of his imminent political demise \u2013 and so long as the content and the implications of the Clinton emails remain unknown \u2013 we cannot rule out a Trump presidency completely. </p> <p>The issue of character has dominated the campaign. Trump\u2019s fitness for office, his persistent appeals to the worst fears and least attractive elements of American public opinion, his unwillingness to accept the results of the election. And Clinton has been plagued by decades-long enmity towards her among large segments of the electorate and persistent questions about her honesty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/07/is-the-us-australia-anchor-of-peace-immune-from-rust\">Is the US-Australia 'anchor of peace' immune from rust? | Carl Ungerer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the first time since 1980, unease about America\u2019s standing in the world \u2013 and how it should respond to numerous foreign policy challenges \u2013 has taken outsized prominence in a US presidential election. For Australia, vastly different implications for foreign and defence policy, as well as trade and investment, would flow from the election of Clinton or Trump.</p> <p>On the question of a Clinton or Trump presidency, Australian public opinion is utterly unambiguous. Earlier this year, before Trump\u2019s most shameful moments, the United States Studies Centre fielded questions about the US-Australia relationship to the more than 100,000 Australians who took the ABC\u2019s Vote Compass survey: 70% said Australia should distance itself from the United States if Trump is elected (just 24% said Australia\u2019s relationship with the United States should remain unchanged). </p> <p>Under a Clinton presidency, 87% of Australians would leave the US relationship unchanged, or seek to strengthen it. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s comfort with Clinton is understandable: she has visited here twice as first lady and secretary of state (including the 2012 launch of our sister centre in Perth). Much has been made of Clinton\u2019s hawkishness relative to President Obama\u2019s, her greater instinct to deploy military force and to take an active stance in global affairs. It seems likely that Clinton\u2019s foreign policy will be broadly consistent with Obama\u2019s, but with renewed vigour, less pensive deliberation, and a determination to stand up to global bullies. </p> <p>Three of the foreign policy challenges Clinton (or Trump) face are already apparent.</p> <p>Clinton will need to address ongoing Russian attempts to confront the United States and its interests at the same time as she manages US allies in Europe. Clinton seems determined to take a more active role in stabilising the Middle East, limiting if not eliminating the threat posed by Isis and other extremist groups, and instituting a no fly zone over Syria. Clinton will also need to police the Iran nuclear deal and limit the wider prospects of a Sunni-Shia conflagration stemming from Saudi-Iranian rivalry.</p> <p>In Asia, Clinton must balance the long term trend of increasing cooperation and dialogue between China and the United States alongside China\u2019s increasing assertiveness and militarisation in places like the South China Sea. </p> <p>For months Clinton\u2019s Asia team have been working on plans to further operationalise America\u2019s stabilising alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. North Korea will command immediate attention. Speaking last week, the US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper grimly assessed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/paranoid-north-korea-wont-stop-building-nuclear-weapons-us-spy-chief\">denuclearising the North Korean regime</a> may already be a lost cause, suggesting that the US and its Asian allies may soon face the prospect of North Korean nuclear tipped missiles pointed their way. </p> <p>If the United States is to act to avert this, the next administration will have to make some extremely tough decisions very early in its term. Australia is already committed to play a part in North Korean contingencies by virtue of our role in the UN Command charged with supervising the uneasy armistice on the Korean peninsula. </p> <p>The pressing question for Australia is how a President Clinton might apportion diplomatic and military effort between the Middle East, Russia, and Asia \u2013 and how Australia would seek to shape its contribution.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom is that a President Trump would lead an isolationist America. This is an incorrect simplification. Trump is a nationalist, not an isolationist. Trump has signalled he would increase the United States Navy by 30% and the US Marine Corps by more than 50%. He has pledged to renegotiate the Iran deal and up the fight against Isis, including through the commitment of US (and presumably allied) ground forces in Iraq and Syria. A Trump foreign policy could be very active indeed.</p> <p>Trump has declared he will sharply escalate trade tariffs with China and designate that country a currency manipulator. He has simultaneously promised to increase the presence of the US military in Asia (including in hotspots like the South China Sea) and withdraw forces contributing to the defence of South Korea and Japan. All of these moves are destabilising in a rapidly evolving Asian strategic situation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/unlike-julia-gillard-hillary-clinton-will-inherit-an-electorate-incredibly-alive-to-sexism\">Unlike Julia Gillard, Hillary Clinton will inherit an electorate incredibly alive to sexism | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most immediately, a President Trump would force Australia to a decision on Japan. Trump\u2019s dislike of Japan is visceral and long held, stemming back to 1987 when he bought full page ads in the New York Times claiming that Japan was taking advantage of the US. Would Australia, hedging against less predictable US engagement in Asia, continue its decade long trend towards a closer security relationship with Japan? Or to assure Trump, would Australia seek to distance itself from Japan, distinguishing Australia\u2019s alliance from one the new President sees as unfair and unrewarding?</p> <p>Though Clinton is the status quo candidate for Australians, her presidency may not be \u2013 she will face pressure to demonstrate that US allies are contributing to US interests. </p> <p>A Trump presidency however would put the US-Australia relationship under much greater stress. It would be unpalatable to a majority of Australians, and concerning to those with responsibilities for Australia\u2019s foreign and defence policy. </p> <p>These concerns would be compounded by uncertainty as to which of Trump\u2019s many (and often contradictory) campaign pronouncements would actually be implemented \u2013 and by whom. All of this would put immense pressure on the bipartisan consensus that has guided Australia\u2019s relationship with America.</p> <p><em>James Brown is director of research and Simon Jackman is professor of political science and chief executive officer, both of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. </em></p>",
