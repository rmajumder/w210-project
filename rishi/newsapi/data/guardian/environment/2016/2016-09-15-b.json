  "<p>The number of women dying from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth has almost halved since 1990, a global report has revealed.</p> <p>Worldwide the annual number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births fell by 44% between 1990 and 2015, from approximately 385 to 216.</p> <p>But the figure came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/12/un-report-maternal-deaths-slow-recent-progress-calls-for-action\">far below the target</a> set by the United Nations as part of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/28/millennium-development-goals-4-and-5-15-achievements-child-mortality-maternal-health\">millennium development goals</a> in 2000, which aimed to see a drop of 75% by 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/29/giving-birth-guinea-maternal-health-life-death-lottery-bereft-midwives-medicine\">Giving birth in Guinea: a life or death lottery bereft of midwives and medicine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report also highlights that global inequalities in maternal healthcare are increasing, with the gap between countries with the lowest level of maternal deaths and the highest doubling between 1990 and 2013, reaching a 200-fold difference.</p> <p>\u201cLots of people worked very hard and progress was achieved, but it was patchy,\u201d said Wendy Graham from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was a co-coordinator of the report. \u201cLike many things in health, in the progress that the average receives invariably there are some left behind.\u201d</p> <p>It is estimated that 210 million women become pregnant every year, with 140 million babies born. But according to the report \u2013 a series of six papers published in the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-health-2016\">Lancet</a> by an international team of researchers \u2013 provision of maternal healthcare worldwide is hugely variable.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about human rights and a lack of standardised care across the world,\u201d said Stephen Kennedy, head of the Nuffield department of obstetrics &amp; gynaecology at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the series.<br></p> <p>\u201cWomen should be as healthy as possible before pregnancy and have access to adequate health care when they are pregnant,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is then no reason why common problems in pregnancy shouldn\u2019t be managed in exactly the same everywhere because the evidence base is so strong. We know what to do. The problem is that we are failing to implement that knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>According to the new Lancet series, the chances of a woman dying from childbirth over her lifetime is about one in 4,900 in high-income countries, while for women in sub-Saharan Africa the figure is one in 36. By contrast, according to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/\">World Health Organisation</a>, the UK figure is one in 5,800.</p> <p>\u201c[What] drives some of the risk is that we still have high fertility in some parts of the world,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe still have large parts of low- income countries where there is a high unmet need for contraception.\u201d</p> <p>While births in the presence of skilled birth attendants rose from 57% to 74% between 1990 and 2013, the authors warn that many women in poor and rural settings do not have access to such care, while the increase in coverage does not necessarily mean such care is of high quality. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2015/jul/17/sierra-leone-maternal-mortality-in-pictures\">Sierra Leone's fight to reduce maternal mortality \u2013 in pictures | Misha Hussain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are still about 53 million women who have no care at all at the time of delivery,\u201d said Graham. </p> <p>\u201cIf you have coverage of care that is not good quality you are not going to prevent the deaths,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is a non-trivial proportion of facilities that are called maternity units but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/16/safe-water-sanitation-maternal-deaths\">don\u2019t have running water</a>, don\u2019t have electricity, don\u2019t have trained providers.\u201d</p> <p>Where women do make use of maternal healthcare services, the quality of care can vary dramatically, the authors add, with some receiving too little care, too late. That, they say, can be down to delays in recognising or accessing care, as well as poorly-equipped facilities, with too few staff and a lack of evidence-based care. <br></p> <p>The situation, they add, can arise not only in low income countries, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in high- and middle-income countries due to social inequalities: black women were more likely to die in childbirth in New York in 2010 than women in North Korea or Vietnam. </p> <p>The opposite end of the spectrum is also of concern, the authors write, citing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/16/mothers-fighting-against-birth-intervention\">over-medicalisation</a> of birth that they dub \u201ctoo much too soon\u201d, as shown by high rates of caesarean sections and induced labour as well as unnecessary ultrasound examinations and excessive use of antibiotics.</p> <p>\u201cYou have countries like Brazil and parts of Latin America where about 40% of deliveries are by caesarean section, they are a very common procedure,\u201d said Graham. \u201cNow there is no way that 40% of women need a caesarean section.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e92d34537b781d7ad1afbe3898d0df949ee22aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e92d34537b781d7ad1afbe3898d0df949ee22aa/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman is examined by a midwife at a health clinic near Doko, Siguiri, Guinea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman is examined by a midwife at a health clinic near Doko, Siguiri, Guinea.

The latter, they say, includes offering care not just regarding the pregnancy and birth itself, but also taking into account that older mothers are more likely to have medical conditions that also need to be addressed and considered, as well as different preferences for their care. </p> <p>\u201cThat joined-up thinking and that joined-up working among professionals and services doesn\u2019t really exist in low income countries in many places on the scale that can respond to these epidemiological transitions,\u201d said Graham. </p> <p>Other challenges, the authors note, lie in the boom in people moving into urban centres, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/10/obesity-endangers-health-women-babies-chief-medical-officer\">rise in obesity</a>, pointing out that in 2014, 13% of mothers were obese. </p> <p>\u201cAgain it is this issue of getting prepared for services to meet the needs of obese patients,\u201d said Graham. </p> <p>The report also highlights the need for emergency services to provide better maternal health care during crises, from outbreaks such as that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/zika-virus\">Zika virus</a> to mass migration, whether political or environmental. </p> <p>\u201cYour first line services have to recognise that pregnancy will continue and births will happen,\u201d said Graham. \u201cSystems need to be more resistant to what we call shocks \u2013 whether it is Zika or indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/23/ebola-sierra-leone-save-lives-women-childbirth-msf-hospital\">ebola</a>, shocks happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe new report makes it evident that there is a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots,\u201d said Katja Iversen chief executive of <a href=\"http://womendeliver.org/\">Women Deliver</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWe have come far in bringing down maternal mortality, but we are definitely not there yet,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is not just about increasing the number of health centres, it is also about women\u2019s economic status in society. It is not just about increasing the quality of care that women receive, it is also about education, nutrition and equality. And it is not just about low income countries, it is also something that we see in pockets of very wealthy countries.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It has been a strange year for the Mercury prize: no one could find much to complain about in the shortlist.</p> <p>In previous years, the shortlist has variously been upbraided for being too mainstream, not mainstream enough, too narrow or too tokenistic. This year, the solitary voice raised in objection seemed to belong to the Sun\u2019s showbiz editor, angrily decrying the judging panel for failing to nominate Adele \u2013 despite her \u201csales, huge sell-out tour and international chart domination\u201d \u2013 commercial success having long proved the most reliable indicator possible of any album\u2019s artistic value.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there seemed to be general agreement that the shortlist did a pretty decent job: so decent, in fact, that the field seemed open.

It\u2019s the biggest album yet to have emerged from grime\u2019s remarkable commercial resurgence, and embodies a lot of the characteristics that make that resurgence feel uniquely exciting and vibrant.</p> <p>It\u2019s music that has succeeded independently of the music industry. Self-released, it makes few concessions to pop commerciality \u2013 the music on it seems more interested in placing itself firmly within a lineage of underground British black music than pandering to the charts \u2013 but nevertheless became a huge hit. </p> <p>It is genuinely heartening evidence that in a world of focus-grouped pop and micro-managed hype, stuff that rejects the traditional path to success pursued by big record companies can still become hugely successful.</p> <p>It\u2019s also marked by an infectious confidence. Boosted by the support of Drake, Skepta is the first grime artist to make real waves in the US \u2013 a country given to treating UK rappers like well-meaning poor relations, or else ignoring them altogether \u2013 but sounds coolly unruffled by the prospect of Transatlantic success.</p> <p>It\u2019s a resolutely British album: the R&amp;B-inspired tracks that seem to have one eye on American audiences are vastly outnumbered by thrilling, explosive blasts of unreconstructed grime, the lyrics come thick with British slang and indeed a certain British bathos \u2013 he may well be the first rapper in history to use the phrase \u201cspend a penny\u201d or compare himself to Welsh children\u2019s television hero Fireman Sam \u2013 and when a huge star like Pharrell Williams makes a guest appearance, you\u2019re struck by the sense that he\u2019s trying to fit into Skepta\u2019s world rather than vice versa.</p> <p>Whether American audiences will follow suit en masse is an interesting question, but almost beside the point: as it is, Konnichiwa is at the forefront of the most exciting thing happening in British pop. </p>",

The prize is meant to be about the album that represents British music right now.

A thriving, commercially successful scene that simply never gets a look-in.

Those are the three acts that actually speak to the reality of modern British pop, the first two as representative of a grassroots scene, the latter as a clever portrayal of playlist culture.</li> <li>If forced to bet, I\u2019d go for Kano and Skepta, not least as a response to last year\u2019s criticism over the lack of grime.</li> </ul> <p>And here\u2019s a picture of Skepta and his crew!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce019b17ad0c987b3f4ed366c1f71096529f72c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce019b17ad0c987b3f4ed366c1f71096529f72c0/0_146_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skepta \u2026 You know that lyric about smoking in no-smoking areas in Shutdown?

Union sources told Weekly Beast that SBS bosses had declared that staff desks are \u201cpersonal work spaces\u201d and therefore cannot be sullied by flyers from the two unions negotiating a new deal for the workers: the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and the Community and Public Sector Union. \u201cWe do note that there has been instances where posters, notices and other union material has been affixed to areas outside of these notice boards,\u201d wrote one executive. \u201cIn these cases the materials have been removed. We ask that you remind organisers, delegates and union members to place material only on these notice boards. In addition we ask that you refrain from placing union materials on desks throughout our offices, as these spaces are often seen as personal workspaces and should be respected as such.\u201d</p> <p>That was until Thursday morning, when they wanted to promote a yes vote and the human resources people went around the building distributing vote yes flyers on every desk \u2013 sneakily accompanied by chocolate treats \u2013 in an effort to convince staff. The unions are urging a no vote, saying the agreement in its current form <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.meaa.org/meaa-media/media-industrial-updates/\">contains \u201csavage cuts\u201d to conditions</a>. The union reps are wondering what happened to those \u201cpersonal work spaces\u201d?</p> <h2>Mitchell names his favourite scribes</h2> <p>Despite a week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/12/chris-mitchell-memoir-reveals-six-figure-pay-rise-after-giving-rupert-murdoch-ultimatum\">indiscreet revelations</a> about prime ministers and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s family, Chris Mitchell\u2019s memoir won\u2019t be officially launched by Malcolm Turnbull at New South Wales Parliament House for another two weeks. The prime minister is an unsurprising choice to launch Making Headlines as he is possibly the only living prime minister the former editor-in-chief of the Australian hasn\u2019t insulted. Mitchell says Turnbull and John Howard are the only two prime ministers who knew what they were doing. Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott are summarily dismissed in the book, a tome in which Mitchell paints himself as one of the greats and Murdoch as a genius. The Australian is the \u201csingle most important private institution in our country\u201d, which under his great leadership broke more stories with its $50m budget than the ABC does with its entire $1bn budget.</p> <p>A review by David Fagan, also a former editor of the Australian and the Courier-Mail, says the book is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chris-mitchell-writes-a-love-letter-to-himself-65231\">essentially a love letter to Mitchell himself</a>. Fagan: \u201cIndeed, it is hard to find anyone on these pages matching the wisdom Mitchell has carried through the two decades he describes editing the Australian and the Courier-Mail in Brisbane. A handful of journalists he describes as friends have helped, but pretty well everyone else has failed to meet his standards.\u201d</p> <p>So who are Mitchell\u2019s favourites? \u201cThe Australian\u2019s brilliant environment editor Graham Lloyd\u201d is one. Political writers Paul Kelly and Dennis Shanahan, a writing team \u201clight years ahead\u201d of any other media organisation is another and the Oz\u2019s economics, business, higher education and arts writers are the best in the business. Hedley Thomas, who has been described by others as Mitchell\u2019s attack dog, is also singled out for praise. The Oz news pages are \u201cstraight down the line\u201d the rightwing warrior says with a straight face. But Fairfax, on the other hand, is always letting its political colours show in its news coverage. The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s political writers Mark Kenny, James Massola, Latika Bourke and Matthew Knott are so leftwing that their \u201centire world view is from a Green perspective\u201d, Mitchell says, while Laura Tingle and Phil Coorey on the Australian Financial Review are \u201cfar to the left of the AFR\u201d itself.</p> <p>Mitchell is not active on Twitter \u2013 he admits he Googles users\u2019 names to find their tweets \u2013 but he does see it as the most \u201cpernicious\u201d threat to modern journalism. He sagely advises editors to \u201cpolice the Twitter feeds of their senior political reporters lest silly comments mar the professionalism of their political coverage and their publication\u201d. The Australian\u2019s associate editor Chris Kenny, whose sole occupation appears to be tweeting about the alleged bias of the ABC, apparently escaped Mitchell\u2019s attention.</p> <h2>Chinese propaganda?</h2> <p>Last Friday the Sydney Morning Herald published a story about a university report which warned that the Chinese government\u2019s message was being spread locally by the media in Australia. Headlined \u201cChinese propaganda found in local media\u201d we wondered if the story could possibly be referring to the Herald\u2019s own pivotal role in spreading Chinese propaganda each month. The report found clear evidence Chinese propaganda \u201chad moved offshore from the mainland\u201d and become integrated with Chinese-language media in Australia. Yes we agree. It is published monthly in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/14/fairfaxs-china-propaganda-sheet-reveals-beijings-enormous-restraint\">a mini-newspaper, China Watch</a>. </p> <h2>Watchdog win</h2> <p>The ABC\u2019s Media Watch had a supreme court ruling in its favour against investigative journalist Natalie O\u2019Brien who tried to sue the program for defamation. A front-page report by O\u2019Brien, published in the Sun-Herald in 2013, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3813729.htm\">was criticised by Paul Barry on Media Watch</a> as misleading. The story warned of dangerous levels of toxic chemicals in soil near a Sydney playground. But on Thursday Justice Lucy McCallum agreed with Barry\u2019s assessment and found for the defendant.</p> <p>\u201cIn my assessment Mr Barry\u2019s criticism of the Sun-Herald and Ms O\u2019Brien represented an honest opinion, being well within the bounds of what could fairly be said by way of comment or opinion on the facts stated,\u201d McCallum said. An ABC spokesman said the broadcaster would pursue costs. </p>",
  "<p>Bit by bit, Sadiq Khan\u2019s formula for changing London\u2019s housing landscape is coming into view. A little more was sketched in on Wednesday. Answering <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/documents/s59136/04%20MQT%20Priority%20Order.pdf\">questions</a> from Labour AM Tom Copley about his long-term goal of making 50% of all new homes in London \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d, Khan, as is now his habit, warned that \u201cwe won\u2019t fix the housing crisis overnight\u201d but went on: \u201cI\u2019m going to raise the level of affordable housing by using my planning powers alongside investing the funding available and the release of public land. In terms of planning, my team are currently developing supplementary planning guidance \u2013 SPG \u2013 to increase the numbers of affordable homes delivered through the planning system.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve already seen him exercise those planning powers. Last month, Khan <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-boosts-affordable-homes-at-old-oak\">approved plans</a> for the first large housing development on the vast <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/old-oak-and-park-royal-development-corporation-opdc/about-opdc-0\">Old Oak and Park Royal</a> site in west London after the number of \u201caffordable\u201d homes was bumped up from 200 to 242 \u2013 from 33% of the total of 605 to 40%, with the possibility of raising that to 50% if sufficient profits are produced in the future. More recently, to the east, he <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-approves-up-to-10000-new-homes-in-barking\">approved the masterplan</a> for the huge <a href=\"http://barkingriverside.co.uk/\">Barking Riverside</a> regeneration after the \u201caffordable\u201d proportion of the possible 10,000 new homes there was upped from 28% to 35%. Provision for a possible subsequent hike to 50% is built in there too.</p> <p>Those were substantial tweaks to big bits of London housing arithmetic that had been lined up for a big tick from Boris Johnson. But it\u2019s the draft SPG, expected in October, that will formally set the tone of the new mayoral administration on housing delivery. Khan explained that it has to be written \u201cwithin the context of the policies in the current London Plan\u201d, the legally-binding master policy blueprint for the development of the capital\u2019s land. He intends to change the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan\">Plan</a>, but acknowledged he\u2019ll be bound by the present version \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, which could mean three years - that\u2019s how long it took Johnson to produce a replacement for Ken Livingstone\u2019s. </p> <p>Khan said that this constraint means \u201cI cannot set a target for affordable housing\u201d. This might come as a surprise - there have been <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/khan-plans-35-affordable-housing-policy/7016293.article\">reports</a> that a 35% affordable \u201cbenchmark\u201d for all new private housing schemes could be included in the SPG. But a target and a benchmark are not the same. Khan said that in drafting the SPG he was \u201cexploring an innovative new approach, whereby if applicants voluntarily meet an agreed level of affordable housing, they could benefit from a faster and more certain planning process\u201d.</p> <p>He stressed that \u201cthis level has not been finalized or announced\u201d, though 35% seems unlikely to be far wide of the mark. But the operative word in all of this seems to be \u201cvoluntarily\u201d. SPGs do not (and cannot) introduce new planning policies, but they serve to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance\">elaborate on or sharpen existing ones</a>. </p> <p>The current London Plan policy on affordable housing requires only the \u201cmaximum reasonable\u201d to be supplied as part of each individual private development. Khan is hoping to incentivise developers to maximise what they deem \u201creasonable\u201d by effectively telling them that if they are prepared to meet the affordable level he sets down in the SPG, he will help to speed them on their way. </p> <p>Copley asked if this therefore meant that developers who didn\u2019t accept the \u201caffordable\u201d housing levels he had in mind would find their assessments of a scheme\u2019s financial viability coming under close scrutiny from him. Khan\u2019s response? \u201cNot an unfair summary of where we\u2019re going\u201d. A team of viability boffins is being recruited for such tasks.</p> <p>City Hall later elaborated: \u201cDevelopers may opt to meet new minimum affordable housing thresholds to fast-track their applications\u201d. So for \u201cbenchmark\u201d read \u201cthresholds\u201d (the plural may or may not be significant. I\u2019m told there\u2019s still a bit of a fine-tuning to be done). </p> <p>The other angle on all this is that Khan\u2019s affordable levels/thresholds are being designed to bring more clarity, speed and consistency to the planning application process. Recent controversies over viability assessments - in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/oct/16/earls-court-questions-of-viability\">Earls Court</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">Southwark</a>, for example - have centred on concerns that well-resourced developers get the better of boroughs in negotiations over the amount of affordable housing they supply as part of the deal. Yet some developers say that they could do without the grief viability wrangles entail. So there\u2019s a trade-off to be proffered brewing here: in return for higher affordable yields Khan will provide a more straightforward planning environment and preferential treatment for the obliging.</p> <p>There is a long way to go before that 50% goal starts to be met. For example, Khan confirmed to Copley that doing so is going to mean hitting more than 50% affordable on publicly-owned land, such as TfL\u2019s - no small task. But be glad. What we\u2019re seeing the start of in Khan\u2019s City Hall is a more rigorous approach to property market regulation, which is what planning policy is for. His Tory critics warn that it can only make things worse, but Khan hopes he\u2019s got the key players onside. Their responses to the SPG will be enlightening. <br></p>",
  "<p>Six weeks ago, the British government unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">turned down the dimmer switch</a> on the Hinkley Point nuclear power station project. Today it insouciantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">turned the switch right back up again</a>. The deal \u2013 colossal in terms of its \u00a318bn cost, UK energy needs and relations with sovereign investors like China \u2013 is still exactly the same in most of its essentials as it was in July.</p> <p>Yet while it now turns out that there will be no U-turn over Hinkley, the delay has involved something a bit more substantial than a governmental summer screen break. In today\u2019s announcement, the business secretary, Greg Clark, highlighted that the go-ahead for Hinkley was subject to two conditions. One is that the UK government keeps a golden share in Hinkley and similar projects; the other is that ownership of key national assets will be subject to a national security test.<br><br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/535y2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2720468\"            data-video-name=\"Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57da6ff2e4b0e813b694d401\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915hinkley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These conditions should be seen as more than mere window dressing. True, similar conditions are the norm in many other major economies. True also, the British government possesses some powers of this kind already. Most people are likely to see them as utterly sensible. What is different, however, is the new political saliency given to such thinking, which accords to government an ineradicable place to act in the national interest. This suggests something bigger and deeper is changing in our politics.</p> <p>The insistence that government needs the power to exercise judicious control over the ownership of an industry in the national interest may seem sensible and moderate to most people. Yet it also seems revolutionary and radical. It is a break from a recent past in which global market forces have routinely been treated as the only secure basis for ownership decisions.</p> <p>Much the same goes for a requirement that a national security consideration be given to large infrastructure projects. This too sounds like common sense. Yet it needed saying. The UK\u2019s appetite for inward investment is now so large that even national security is being increasingly relegated to the margins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"efae2e2d9bd34225b53fe2ad81c4b8dfd2a2706f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efae2e2d9bd34225b53fe2ad81c4b8dfd2a2706f/305_0_2576_3008/856.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary, Greg Clark, \u2018drew a line\u2019 under George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business - and \u2018began to push back\u2019.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary, Greg Clark, \u2018drew a line\u2019 under George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business - and \u2018began to push back\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The re-examination of Hinkley is actually less important in terms of the substance of the deal than for these wider signals. It is one sign among many that the economic liberalism of the political right, which has been in such ascendancy since the 1980s, no longer eclipses all other considerations, including the human cost. Clark didn\u2019t bury George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business \u2013 what a vacuous phrase it is \u2013 even in sensitive sectors this week. But he drew a line under it and, in a limited way, began to push back.</p> <p>Not before time, many will say. Not yet enough, lots will add. Both observations are right. But we should nevertheless see this moment in our history for what it is. At the end of the 20th century, the triumph of capitalism and democracy seemed at one stage so complete that an era of global economic liberalism appeared to beckon. Today the folly of that delusion has been made obvious by the financial crisis and its political consequences.</p> <p>But it is not just the economic liberalism of the 80s that has hit rough water. So too has the socio-cultural liberalism of the 60s, with its belief in universal rights and the meaninglessness of difference. That form of liberalism has not been able to withstand the challenge of militant Islamism, with its denial of any universality except its own dogmas. The impact on liberal politics and liberal nation states continues to be immense, visible in Britain in everything from Brexit to the rise in state investigatory powers.</p> <p>Liberalism is a Hydra-headed and extremely resilient creature. There are also few words in the political dictionary that mean so many different things in different contexts. Most of us consider ourselves liberals in some respects but not in others. Adherents of 60s social liberalism are not necessarily adherents of 80s economic liberalism, or vice versa. Nor is either liberalism quite as absolutist as is sometimes claimed. Most people are somewhere on a spectrum of views, whether on social issues or economics.</p> <p>We should not pronounce the death of liberalism prematurely. Just because it is full of contradictions and cannot solve the problems of the age, it does not follow that liberalism is ignoble or that it is doomed to collapse \u2013 still less that there is some self-evidently superior alternative. Most people, at least in Britain, still seem prepared to support the liberal democratic order and many of the important liberal social and economic ideas on which it rests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"316b197a19b120512f41e0a0fad6c7be03784fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316b197a19b120512f41e0a0fad6c7be03784fa1/750_0_3077_3120/986.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May in Downing Street after becoming prime minister: \u2018Her speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.\u2019\" width=\"986\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May in Downing Street after becoming prime minister: \u2018Her speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly useful to see ours not as a liberal age but as a post-liberal one. There has been a rumbling discussion about post-liberalism for some years, triggered not least by concerns about the weakening impact of migration on national social democracies. But it is striking that this week saw the publication of a book by <a href=\"http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/the-politics-of-virtue\">John Milbank and Adrian Pabst</a>, which takes post-liberalism as an established reality and as the starting point for the examination of a new kind of politics based on a vision of social and personal virtue and what the authors dub conservative socialism.</p> <p>In Britain, the arrival of Theresa May in Downing Street in the wake of the Brexit vote is the most striking example of this shift. May is not an economic liberal like Margaret Thatcher or a social liberal like David Cameron. In fact, liberalism of any kind seems almost a marginal consideration in her thinking and her policy making. These are still early days, but May\u2019s speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.</p> <p>All of this poses a particular problem to the one party in British politics that proudly defines itself as liberal. The Liberal Democrats have more immediate hand-to-mouth concerns as they gather for their conference in Brighton than whether liberalism is in terminal eclipse. Nevertheless, in government between 2010 and 2015, the Lib Dems were the victims both of the crisis of economic liberalism, in the shape of austerity, and the crisis of social liberalism, in the rise of anti-migrant feeling articulated by Ukip. Liberals need to get real as well as feel sorry for themselves.</p> <p>As Milbank and Pabst stress, liberalism is certainly not inherently bad, but it does have defects and inherent problems. Brexit is in part a revolt against a set of characteristics of modern liberalism. We have a new political agenda that no political party can afford to ignore. Whether we consider ourselves liberal or not, we increasingly inhabit post-liberal times.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump attempted to combat widespread criticism of his sketchy economic policies by setting out what he presented as a new vision for the country that he audaciously claimed would create 25m new jobs in a decade and put the American worker first.<br></p> <p>Addressing one of the country\u2019s most august economic debating societies, the Economic Club of New York, the Republican presidential nominee sought to dispel the criticism that has dogged his campaign that his mathematics do not add up in balancing tax cuts and new spending. Sticking closely to a pre-prepared script \u2013 despite an initial malfunctioning of his teleprompter - he delivered a speech that was billed in advance by his senior advisers as the culmination of his thinking on how to get America back to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">Donald Trump to Dr Oz: I feel 'as good today as I did at 30'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmerican cars will travel the roads,\u201d he said, \u201cAmerican planes will soar the skies, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, American hands will rebuild this nation, and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the unapologetically populist tone, Trump tried to puncture criticisms that his plan lacked substance by putting figures to his ambitions. He projected 25m new jobs would be created broadly within the timeframe of a two-term Trump presidency, as a result of an average annual growth rate that would rise from current projections of about 2% to 3.5% through his tax-cutting and trade policies.</p> <p>The audaciousness of that boast is underlined by comparison with previous presidents. It would bring American job creation levels back to the golden days enjoyed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s when the dotcom boom and an expanding global economy saw 21m jobs created under his watch.</p> <p>By contrast, Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in the White House have seen almost 10m jobs created within a sluggish recovery from the 2008 collapse.</p> <p>Even more audaciously, Trump said he could achieve such a boon to employment while keeping the national budget deficit neutral. \u201cIf we achieve 4% growth it will reduce the deficit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Buoyed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">new polls</a> showing him in effect tied nationally with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the real estate billionaire said he could pull off such a turnaround in the US economy through a combination of traditional conservative tax cutting and by tearing up trade deals and bringing jobs back to America from Mexico and China. His words were given added poignancy, though he did not make overt reference to the fact, by the setting of his speech in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue, a legendary hotel bought by a Chinese insurance company in 2014.</p> <p>On taxes, Trump proposed to simplify the tax code into three brackets down from seven, and to take poor earners out of tax altogether with individuals with an income under $25,000 (\u00a319,000) and married couples under $50,000 paying no tax. </p> <p>However, with his tax cuts applying to all earners, no matter how wealthy, they would have a regressive effect. The Tax Policy Center has calculated the richest 0.1% would on average see tax cuts under his plan of $1.3m in 2017 compared with just $5,100 for everybody else.</p> <p>Trump tried to counter that criticism that he was putting forward policies that would benefit the 1% by modelling how average families would fare under his vision. A married couple earning $5m a year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses would only get a 3% reduction in their tax bill, he said, compared with a 35% reduction for a similar couple earning $50,000 and with $8,000 in child care.</p> <p>\u201cPeople earning $5m will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all,\u201d he said. </p> <p>But in other parts of his address, he underlined reforms that would be to the advantage of wealthy Americans, including his proposed abolition of the estate tax that is only paid on inheritances valued at over $5m. He also repeated his promise to slash the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, earning a robust cheer from the many corporate leaders eating lunch on the ballroom floor in front of him.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been widely criticized by analysts. This week the global firm <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-economy-idUSKCN11J25M\">Oxford Economics</a> predicted that the US economy could shrink by $1tn by the end of a single term Trump presidency as a result of his proposed tax cuts, barriers to trade and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>That would be the equivalent of 5% of US GDP, with knock-on effects for growth around the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/trump-clinton-health-medical-records-ohio-rally\">Donald Trump questions Clinton\u2019s health at rally in Ohio: \u2018You think this is easy?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the specific sticking points with the Trump plan highlighted by experts has been how the sums add up. On the one hand, he wants to see massive tax cuts, greater he said than any time since President Reagan; but on the other he also wants to pump more money into the US military and to preserve spending on social security and medicare. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">Independent analysis</a> has calculated that his tax cuts would bring down federal revenues by almost $10tn (trillion) over a decade, leaving even less fat in the system to cover his other ambitions.</p> <p>The point was raised in a question to Trump after his speech from Martin Feldstein, an economics professor from Harvard, who asked the Republican nominee what assets he would deploy to offset the sharp reduction in federal revenue from tax cuts.

The big thing over neutrality is the amount of business we will generate, and how we will stop companies take jobs out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the new figures that he peppered through his talk, the policy he outlined remained posited on faith that his strong leadership would bring about levels of growth and job creation that have eluded recent incumbents of the Oval Office. \u201cThis is what our new future will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to lower your taxes, I\u2019m going to get rid of regulation, I\u2019m going to unleash American energy. We are going to put the American worker back to work.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A gorgeous July day in Paris, the haute couture shows are in full swing and the <a href=\"http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/\">Four Seasons hotel</a> is in glamour lockdown. A motorcade of buffed, black, presidential-scale cars lines the kerb outside its street entrance, currently occupied by two women in red-carpet hair and makeup who have paused at the exit for a prolonged session with a selfie stick. Inside, a chandelier the size of a meteorite twinkles above a vast expanse of black and white marble floor, the airy space punctuated by urns crowded with triffid-sized white gladioli, reed slender and supermodel height.</p> <p>In other words, the scene is perfectly set for the entrance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/09/olivier-rousteing-balmain-rihanna-fashion-paris\">Olivier Rousteing</a>, Balmain\u2019s creative director and Paris fashion\u2019s most glamorous frontman. Except, of course, he isn\u2019t here yet, because I am 10 minutes early and he \u2013 like any self-respecting rock star \u2013 will be 20 minutes late. The restaurant is mostly empty, the diners having spilled out into the courtyard for post-lunch cigarettes and espresso, so I sip a Diet Coke served with elaborate ceremony by a waitress in a cocktail dress, and wait.</p> <p>And then here he is. He is in a black fedora, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/keithrichards\">Keith Richards</a> vibes, a sharp Balmain blazer with sleeves pushed up to the elbow. His chunky black and gold Rolex is exactly the watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tutankhamun\">Tutankhamun</a> would have worn, were he to be reincarnated in 2016. Skinny jeans, biker boots, a black T-shirt faded to the perfect sultry charcoal. His sunglasses are enormous, the size of lab goggles. There is an awkward moment when he sits down opposite me and I think he isn\u2019t going to take them off, but then he does, flashing me the wide, slightly distancing smile of the very beautiful, the smile of a man accustomed to being admired.</p> <p>He is ridiculously good-looking. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=zoolander&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=1280&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwhfu2_6nOAhXkIMAKHWA3DeMQ_AUIBigB&amp;dpr=1\">Zoolander</a> good-looking. Poreless skin, worked-out body, cheekbones for days. And while being good-looking has never been part of the job description for a traditional fashion designer, that is the point, because Rousteing is very much a non-traditional fashion designer. He is mixed race. He loves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/14/whats-wrong-with-studying-the-kardashians\">the Kardashians</a>. He posts <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/olivier_rousteing/?hl=en\">endless selfies</a>. And he has reinvented the house founded by <a href=\"http://www.balmain.com/en_au/heritage\">Pierre Balmain</a> in 1945 as a new kind of fashion enterprise, one that \u201cis very pop, but communicates like a luxury brand\u201d. He is not always adored by the critics (of which more later). But can 3.8 million Instagram followers be wrong?</p> <p>The industry is scathing about designers who pour their creative energies into their celebrity friendships and social media feeds, but Rousteing turns this on its head. He tells me the moment his creativity stepped up a notch was five years ago, when he moved from behind the scenes at Balmain to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/06/christophe-decarnin-fashion-balmain\">Christophe Decarnin</a> as creative director. \u201cThat was a big step,\u201d he says. \u201cSchool can teach you to be a great \u2018designer\u2019\u201d \u2013 he puts ironic speech marks around the word with his fingers, as if to suggest being a designer isn\u2019t really a proper job \u2013 \u201cbut there is so much more to being a creative director.\u201d This job title, by contrast, he says in reverential tones. \u201cIt means overseeing everything from the business to the fittings to the campaign to the stores. It means having a vision.\u201d Where the traditionalists of Paris revere the role of designer and roll their eyes at that of creative director, Rousteing does the opposite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d4ccb93a94e5753cbf81c70afe27a337637fb58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d4ccb93a94e5753cbf81c70afe27a337637fb58/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Rousteing backstage at Paris Fashion week with bosom buddies Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Rousteing backstage at Paris fashion week with bosom buddies Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Dufour/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frankly, Rousteing\u2019s Balmain frightens the life out of the fashion establishment, particularly in Paris, where a few blue-chip family names \u2013 Gainsbourg, Deneuve, de la Fressange, de la Falaise \u2013 have for decades ruled the front row like a quaint oligarchy. Rousteing, by contrast, has forged an alliance with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kardashian</a>-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">West</a>s, an American family who have built a multimillion global empire on sex tapes and nude selfies. To use an analogy with a suitable level of cultural bling, Olivier Rousteing is to the Kardashians what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/botticelli\">Sandro Botticelli</a> was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/great-dynasties-medici-family\">the Medici family</a>. Critics who dismiss Balmain\u2019s dresses as vulgar because they are made for Kim Kardashian might bear in mind that Botticelli painted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2012/mar/19/sandro-botticelli-primavera-spring-artworks\">Primavera</a> for the Medicis.</p> <p>The Balmain aesthetic is tight, bright and leggy. It is a rarefied, artisan-embroidered, exquisitely tailored version of an aesthetic instantly recognisable by any 18-year-old as Friday-night partywear. \u201cSome people feel luxury shouldn\u2019t look like what the masses like,\u201d Rousteing says. \u201cThey feel it should be more elitist. But Balmain talks to young people. It\u2019s not about selling to them, it\u2019s about making them part of my world. And the people who can afford to buy luxury fashion, today those women want to feel young. So Balmain is pop, but it is a luxury brand as well. I don\u2019t think you have to make sad, complicated clothes to show you have depth.\u201d The aesthetic is accessible, but the prices are stratospheric \u2013 so high that they make Balmain feel aspirational in an abstract way. Like diamonds, or skiing holidays.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3fe1c030ebd1e618944b35b4e401ae2b0e6c78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3fe1c030ebd1e618944b35b4e401ae2b0e6c78/0_0_2550_3000/850.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Rousteing hanging out with his buddy, the singer Justin Bieber, at a gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\" width=\"850\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Rousteing hanging out with Justin Bieber at the Met Ball in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Together, Rousteing, the Kardashians and a \u201cBalmain army\u201d of I\u2019m-with-the-brand model-groupies have staged a coup over the fashion establishment as gamechanging as it is glamorous, in which the traditional gatekeepers of taste are bypassed. Consider, for example, how Balmain\u2019s autumn/winter 2016 collection has made it into the public consciousness. When Kardashian-clan supermodel and Rousteing\u2019s close friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kendalljenner/?hl=en\">Kendall Jenner</a> opened and closed the show in March, she shared the moment with her 63 million Instagram followers. (It pains me to say it, but with that kind of instant reach, it arguably doesn\u2019t matter whether newspaper critics like your show.) In July, Kanye West and Rousteing jointly released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsA84bXrBZw\">music video for West\u2019s single Wolves</a> which doubled as the Balmain autumn/winter 2016 campaign video, featuring Kim Kardashian and models including <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joansmalls/?hl=en\">Joan Smalls</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/10/jourdan-dunn-crush-of-week\">Jourdan Dunn</a> and <a href=\"http://alessandraambrosio.com/main2.htm\">Alessandra Ambrosio</a> wearing the collection. \u201cWith music, you talk to an entire generation, where sometimes with fashion, you don\u2019t talk to an entire generation because not everybody gets magazines,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13462487/kanye-west-wolves-music-video-balmain-fall-2016-campaign/\">Rousteing told Vogue</a>. Within two days, the video had been watched five million times on YouTube.</p> <p>Yet when we meet, two weeks before the video will be released, Rousteing is in sensitive mood. In particular, and awkwardly, he is fed up with critics, who he feels disparage his work.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality of fashion is that the more success you have, the more haters you get. I am talking about journalists. But I understand that I will not always be loved in fashion, and that the only thing that matters is the business I am building. So, I don\u2019t care.\u201d I am not entirely convinced of the veracity of this sentence, especially when he continues, \u201cYou can dislike my show, but don\u2019t come to my show and then write 20 lines about how my face looks on Instagram! If that\u2019s what you want to write, don\u2019t bother coming to see six months\u2019 hard work. Just stay home!\u201d</p> <p>Haters? It is a word a pop star would use, not a fashion designer. But then that is Rousteing\u2019s world. Earlier that day, I visited the Balmain showroom to see the resort collection, some of which had been showcased during the menswear show the week before. One fringed and latticed leather coatdress in cornflower blue looked familiar: <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/news/rihanna-balmain-party-dress\">Rihanna had already worn it</a> on a night out in London, a couple of days after the show, at which it had been well-documented by the paparazzi. I asked Rousteing how that came about.</p> <p>\u201cThe night of the show, she [Rihanna] texted me and she was like, \u2018Babe, I love that show, so beautiful, it was amazing.\u2019 So I texted back, \u2018What do you like?\u2019 and she sent me a picture of the blue coat and I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll send it tomorrow.\u2019 There is no strategy. It comes from a text, from love and friendship. I don\u2019t need PRs.\u201d At this point he remembers his PR is sitting next to him and says, \u201cI mean, of course I need PR. But I don\u2019t need them for that.\u201d His PR, sanguine, concurs. \u201cWhen you see someone wearing Balmain, there\u2019s no contract. It\u2019s a real relationship, and that\u2019s the magic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fec7a7a49e77a5a2e7894ade6533b3809b23b6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fec7a7a49e77a5a2e7894ade6533b3809b23b6d/0_0_3016_4642/650.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna wore a Balmain outfit to a fragrance launch in Paris just a few days after it was first shown on the catwalk.\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna wore a Balmain outfit to a fragrance launch in Paris just a few days after it was first shown on the catwalk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rousteing has sufficient star quality not just to get his clothes in paparazzi photographs, but to be in the frame himself. There is <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/05/05/fashion/beyonce-taylor-swift-kanye-west-kardashian-met-gala-/s/05AFTERPARTIES-slide-0BFX.html?_r=0\">a striking photograph</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> from this year\u2019s Met Ball after party, in which she is lounging on a velvet sofa, gazing at Rousteing next to her, who is talking and gesticulating, feet pulled up on the sofa as if he owns the place. Rousteing wants to be the face of Balmain, because that is \u201ca positive message\u201d, he says. He spent the first year of his life in an orphanage before being adopted by a middle-class white couple, who brought him up in Bordeaux. \u201cDiverse is a word that is really important to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to show that no matter your background, no matter what colour you are, where you come from, you can feel part of Balmain.\u201d He is a committed activist for diversity in fashion, consistently casting a range of ethnicities for his catwalks and ad campaigns, and appearing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC-n7V2uUc8\">on Newsnight</a> <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/fashion/2015/09/29/olivier-rousteing-guest-editor-style.cnn/video/playlists/cnn-style-fashion-videos/\">and CNN</a> to challenge the fashion industry\u2019s lack of diversity.</p> <p>Rousteing began his career in Italy, where he spent five years at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/13/roberto-cavalli-this-much-i-know\">Roberto Cavalli</a> before moving back to France. For two years, he worked closely with Decarnin, adored by the French Vogue in-crowd for his haute-grunge aesthetic of insanely expensive ripped jeans, before stepping up to replace him in 2011 at the age of just 24. Between 2013 and 2015 revenue grew by 50% \u2013 but this tells only half the story. Balmain\u2019s new celebrity firepower brought it a vast slice of the fashion bandwidth, and this new status as an industry headliner brought about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/oct/15/balmain-x-hm-collaboration-the-first-look\">the collaboration with H&amp;M</a> last year, which made the brand a household name. In June this year, Mayhoola, the Qatari private investment company that owns Valentino, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/22/fashion-house-balmain-sold-to-qatars-mayhoola-sovereign-wealth-fund\">the acquisition of Balmain</a>, with a view to growing the brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ec0c4dad176647d029ad22c698c9f09f3de888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ec0c4dad176647d029ad22c698c9f09f3de888/0_855_3280_3908/839.jpg\" alt=\"Rousteing has re-created Balmain\u2019s aesthetic: under his leadership it is tight, leggy and bright.\" width=\"839\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rousteing has recreated Balmain\u2019s aesthetic: under his leadership it is tight, leggy and bright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lloyd-Evans/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rousteing was closely involved in sealing the deal. \u201cI met them right at the start, and we clicked. They understand the depth in my work. They get that I have success because I work hard.\u201d To paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/27/why-working-girl-offers-the-real-deal-mike-nichols-melanie-griffith\">Melanie Griffiths in Working Girl</a>, Rousteing has a head for business and a bod for Instagram. \u201cThe point of my Instagram is to show the beauty of my life. I want to inspire people. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to post a picture of me where I don\u2019t feel like I am pretty, and I am not going to post a picture of my collection before it is ready. But everything is real. I can post a picture of a flower, of my grandma at Christmas.\u201d The bio on his Instagram reads, \u201cTHIS IS MY REALITY\u201d. To be fair, it is probably quite hard to take a bad photo of someone who looks like Rousteing.</p> <p>He works at this. \u201cI go to the gym every morning at 7.30. I work out, I box, and then I go to work for about 10am. I work late, so I eat in the office in the evening. And then I want to go to sleep, because I will be up early at the gym. I might go out Friday or Saturday, but not both.\u201d He was working late in his office on the Friday evening in November last year when news broke of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-timeline-of-terror\">terrorist attacks</a> that killed more than 130 people. Rousteing\u2019s apartment, like many of his colleagues\u2019, is in the 11th arrondissement, close to where the attacks took place, so they slept in the office. That weekend, he stayed in a hotel. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone in my life in Paris,\u201d he told Vogue. \u201cMy assistants and colleagues went to their boyfriend\u2019s or girlfriend\u2019s or parents\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t have that here.\u201d</p> <p>Rousteing does have a support network, but it is a meta, international one. \u201cWhen I post on Instagram about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin [Bieber]</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton\">Lewis [Hamilton]</a> or Kim or Rihanna, that\u2019s a real friendship I am showing. If I love your album, I\u2019ll post about your music. But also, we can call each other at 5am when we just need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>His connection to the Kardashians came through West, whom he first had lunch with seven years ago. These days, he is very close with Kris Jenner (\u201cI am always with Kris\u201d) and devoted to Kim. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says about Kim. I love her. I love that she is a woman but has more power than so many men. And I love that she is so powerful but always takes care of the people she loves. And I admire her, because she is the best in the world at communicating with people.\u201d Like it or not, Kim makes people want what she has. It\u2019s a gift her friend Rousteing also has. Balmain\u2019s global presence is only going to grow as the house\u2019s new owners add their financial clout to the cultural pull of the Balmain army. \u201cFashion is a business. If you have a job in fashion, you have that job because people want fashion \u2013 and they want my fashion. You can dislike my taste, but you can\u2019t say I\u2019m not relevant.\u201d</p>",

However, we disagree that the fashion industry, and its media representations, don\u2019t play a role.</p> <p>The industry\u2019s promotion of extreme thinness is a major sociocultural pressure that increases eating disorder risk. Furthermore, these pressures are harmful to models, who too often must put their health at risk to keep their job. Legislation that can change this thin-ideal saturated environment has a high potential to decrease the incidence of disordered eating behaviours.</p> <p>The Women\u2019s Equality party\u2019s proposal argues for legislation aiming to increase size and shape diversity in fashion, including through larger sample sizes. Such legislation can be effective when end-users are involved and when enforcement is possible in practice and through the allocation of resources. In&#xa0;addition, providing youth with tools to resist appearance pressures is critical to decreasing rates of disordered eating. The WEP\u2019s additional focus on including media literacy in curriculums would address this. A number of effective, evidence-based media literacy programmes are freely available for schools.</p> <p>Limiting the impact of the thin ideal can only happen through concerted efforts to decrease these pressures and simultaneously help young people resist them.

The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/hinkley-point-c\" title=\"\">only change from a move that infuriated the Chinese and flummoxed the French investors appears to be a British veto</a> on any sale of the Gallic interest during construction, and in future a new national security test for all foreign investment in critical infrastructure. All the pause really illustrates is that when it comes to nuclear, Britain is no longer a player in a world in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/13/russias-state-owned-nuclear-group-keen-to-break-into-uk-market\" title=\"\">Russia</a> and China vie to dominate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans\">China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hinkley C is an unproven design that comes at a punitive cost. Given the bill that will finally be picked up by the British taxpayer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/nuclear-power-is-risky-and-expensive-heres-a-better-idea\" title=\"\">it could well be no riskier</a> to make a commitment on a similar scale to building <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-power-a-national-infrastructure-commission-report\" title=\"\">a smart energy network</a> that delivers power efficiently. This approach could be complemented by investing more heavily in reducing demand through measures such as better insulation, while expanding renewables, whose costs are falling. Already offshore wind is the only source more costly than nuclear.</p> <p>But nuclear clearly has some advantages. It is low carbon and Britain would struggle to meet its target of carbon-free energy by 2050 without it. It will keep the lights on in a way that most renewable energy cannot yet be relied upon to do, although the gap is narrowing as storage technology improves.</p> <p>Unlike onshore windfarms, fracking or even extensive solar installations, all of which arouse powerful local opposition, most of the neighbours at Hinkley C want the investment. It will safeguard existing jobs and it will deliver new ones \u2013 as many as 25,000, it is estimated. British business is eagerly anticipating a supply-line bonanza. Most of all, after the shattering blow of the Brexit vote and its potential impact on foreign investment, it is hard to see how Mrs&#xa0;May could really risk withdrawing approval for Hinkley C.</p> <p>In trying to exercise power, the prime minister has instead illustrated the constraints on her scope for action in an area where she has to maintain a fragile balance between national security, global investment and the demands of climate change politics. She could be forgiven for wishing she was starting somewhere else.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edie.net/news/10/Hinkley-Point-nuclear-energy-plant-development-timeline-and-schedule-2016/\" title=\"\">For nearly a decade</a>, Hinkley C has been presented as the magic bullet that will keep the lights on for generations to come, and a prelude to a huge expansion of nuclear power to meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy and the need to take old, dirty and inefficient capacity out of service. But&#xa0;after some costly experiences, Britain has lost its nuclear know-how: by the time it was completed in 1995, the last nuclear power station to be built, Sizewell B in Suffolk, was 40% over budget and successive governments have retreated from such ambitious infrastructure investment. When, in 2006, Labour tentatively proposed putting nuclear back in the energy mix, it already appeared certain that new nuclear would be built with foreign expertise and capital.</p> <p>British consumers will not bear the \u00a318.5bn&#xa0;construction costs of Hinkley C. But nuclear is far too costly and too slow to produce a return to attract private sector investment without huge incentives. That&#xa0;is why EDF secured a guaranteed price for its electricity that is nearly double the current wholesale cost, for half of its planned lifetime; it is why the government has also underwritten construction costs by \u00a32bn, and it explains the decision which so worried Mrs&#xa0;May, to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/china-to-take-one-third-stake-in-24bn-hinkley-nuclear-power-station\" title=\"\">Beijing to pick up a third of the cost</a> as a quid pro quo for future permission to build at least one nuclear power station to its own design, at Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>The decision is made, but implementation will matter too. The benefits that the government is claiming for the project must be realised. The consumer must not end up with the bill for construction, jobs must come to Britain and above all, the technology has to work. But there is more to it than that. This is a tale that illustrates one of the basic lessons in the No 10 manual of governance: in a competitive field, energy policy is one of the hardest to get right. Keeping the lights on without adding to global warming at a price that consumers can afford is complex. And nuclear, with its lethal waste and high decommissioning costs, is no long-term solution; the worst judgment of all on Mrs May\u2019s first big strategic choice is to find that it drives out investment in other, smarter, solutions which are the real technologies of the future.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s astonishing. British governments have fiddled for a decade with the terms and structure of the Hinkley Point deal. The proposed agreement runs to thousands of pages, as you would expect with an \u00a318bn contract to build the first new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower\">nuclear power station</a> in the UK for a generation. Yet nobody seems to have considered what would happen if <a href=\"http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_New_dawn_for_UK_nuclear_power_2409081.html\">EDF</a>, an over-indebted outfit over-reliant on the goodwill of current and future French politicians, ever wanted to sell Hinkley.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s review is a let-down on the central question of whether the Hinkley Point C project should proceed; she should have binned the project because the technology was unproven and the financial terms a rip-off. </p> <p>But she has addressed the question of future ownership. The UK government will be able to block EDF from selling its stake before and after construction. Similar powers will be secured in future by the UK government taking a special share in infrastructure projects deemed critical to the nation\u2019s security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans\">China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is welcome and overdue. Before the clause was inserted, it would have been possible, in theory, for EDF to sell its majority stake in Hinkley to its Chinese co-financiers, the state-backed CGN firm. Overnight, 7% of the UK\u2019s energy supply could have been in the hands of a country with a long and dishonourable history of cyber espionage.</p> <p>David Cameron and George Osborne, as they conducted their love-in with Beijing in recent years, ignored the worry in their desperation to find a new partner for EDF after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/04/centrica-withdraw-new-nuclear-projects\">Centrica, the owner of British Gas, dropped out of the Hinkley consortium in 2013</a>. The energy select committee, shamefully, also danced around the subject of national security. May deserves some credit for addressing it.</p> <p>The Brexit vote, incidentally, may have strengthened her hand. The EU tends to hate golden shares. Outside the club, it should be easier for the UK to adopt stronger protection over ownership of critical infrastructure. But the government is overstating matters when it says the UK\u2019s policy will now fall into line with other big economies. The US imposes far stricter restrictions on foreign ownership of nuclear plants on its soil.</p> <p>That is why, one assumes, the Chinese appear happy to accept May\u2019s \u201csignificant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">new safeguards</a>\u201d. For Beijing, the big prize has always been the chance to gain international recognition for Chinese technology by building a nuclear power station in Bradwell, Essex, to its own design. That prospect is still alive.</p> <p>But let\u2019s hope May\u2019s brief probe of Hinkley heralds a deeper rethink on the UK\u2019s entire nuclear programme. On cost and design, the adventure has lost touch with common sense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-costs-up-to-37bn\">Estimated cost of Hinkley Point C nuclear plant rises to \u00a337bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, cost. Hinkley, as everybody knows by now, is hideously expensive. If it were up and running today, EDF and CGN would be receiving annual revenues of \u00a32.8bn, calculates Peter Atherton, of Cornwall Energy. But only \u00a31.2bn would represent the market price of the electricity produced. The rest, \u00a31.6bn, would be a top-up payment ultimately paid by the public.</p> <p>The figure is large but, if it were a one-off, perhaps tolerable. The UK\u2019s 27m households use about 40% of the country\u2019s energy. Crunch the numbers and a theoretical \u201cHinkley subsidy\u201d works out to about \u00a324 per household a year at current prices. </p> <p>The problem, of course, is that Hinkley in north Somerset is not a one-off. It will provide about 3,200MW of capacity. The government\u2019s decarbonisation programme envisages up to 18,000MW of nuclear capacity by 2035. If Hinkley-style handouts are repeated, you\u2019re talking serious money for consumers and a big hit to the competitiveness of UK industry.</p> <p>That risk is real because of the second issue: the madness of a nuclear new-build programme in which all are invited to pitch. It\u2019s not just China that wants to bring its kit \u2013 Japanese, South Korean and US firms are also on the ticket for new plants. The UK could end up building four different reactor designs from five different manufacturers. That is inherently more expensive than picking the best design, replicating it and harvesting economies of scale. The UK\u2019s approach, argues Atherton, is \u201cthe equivalent of having the four new Trident nuclear subs built in different shipyards to different designs\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s too late, it seems, to stop Hinkley. But May should order a rethink of the rest of the UK\u2019s nuclear plan. It\u2019s a badly designed mess that no other country would copy.</p>",

Earlier this month new data also showed there has been a 20% rise in the number of people employed on zero-hour contracts, to 900,000, over the last year.</p> <p>Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre said bonuses had their uses but must be handled with care and he highlighted the return to levels last seen when the financial crisis struck in 2008.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, you could see why some employers would want to recognise people and reward them and say \u2018We are through the worst of it\u2019. But on the other hand, there\u2019s a worry that bad habits could return \u2026 I think small bonuses are perhaps a good idea but big bonuses are potentially very dangerous if they encourage people to take excessive risks.\u201d<br></p> <p>David Hillman, with the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \u201cOnce again these figures show that financial sector bonuses are way out of kilter with the rest of the economy. There is a long way to go before the excess of the City is curbed and this huge gulf in rewards between bankers and the public sector is addressed.\u201d</p> <p>The City\u2019s annual bonus round was a feature of the boom years in the early part of the 2000s, but the credit crunch, job losses and a clampdown on some of the riskier activities produced a sharp reduction in the payouts made by banks and other financial companies. The EU also introduced rules designed to limit City bonuses, although the rules actually resulted in many workers demanding higher basic pay. <br></p> <p>But bonus payments have gradually picked up again.</p> <p>The ONS data shows that finance and insurance remained the biggest contributor to the total. Employers in the sector handed out bonuses of \u00a313.9bn to their staff last year \u2013 an increase of 2.2% from a year earlier. But other sectors, such as IT and communication services \u2013 including marketing, advertising and PR \u2013 contributed more to growth as bonuses at non-financial companies rose 5.4% to \u00a330.4bn.<br></p> <p>The rewards on offer in the communications business were highlighted when WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-deal-faces-investor-revolt-at-wpp-agm\">paid its founder and boss Sir Martin Sorrell almost \u00a367m in bonuses</a> for last year. WPP suffered a shareholder rebellion, but approved the payout. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/18/bp-bob-dudley-pay-package-shareholder\"> BP, a majority of shareholders opposed chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s bonus-fuelled \u00a314m pay deal.</a> But the vote is only advisory and the rewards were still handed over.</p> <p>Nick Palmer, a statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cAlthough the finance and insurance industry retains the largest share of the total, other industries, particularly among professional and hi-tech business services, have been the biggest drivers of growth since 2008.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bonuses are spreading beyond the City, even as evidence mounts that the payouts are not good for companies in the long run. A Cornell Law School study found in 2014 that a company performs worse the more it pays its chief executive and that bonuses promote selfishness and opportunism. </p> <p>Neil Woodford, one of the UK\u2019s top fund managers, has recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/top-fund-manager-neil-woodford-investments-scraps-staff-bonuses\">scrapped bonuses for his employees</a>, arguing they are ineffective and can encourage bad behaviour.</p> <p>Finance and insurance workers received the highest average bonus at \u00a313,400 per employee. Health and social workers got virtually nothing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-15T14:52:12/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Bonus graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-15T14:52:12/embed.html\">Bonus graph</a> </figure>  <p>Almost all the total for last year \u2013 \u00a343.7bn \u2013 was in the private sector with few bonuses in the public sector. Civil servants, teachers and hospitality workers were also near the bottom of the rankings.</p> <p>Though the cash value of bonuses was a record last year, the peak year for bonuses as a proportion of total pay was in 2008, when they accounted for 7.1% compared with 6% last year. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/city-bonus-culture-bad-for-customers-the-economy-for-workers-neil-woodford\">The City\u2019s bonus culture was widely blamed for fuelling the credit boom and financial crisis</a> by rewarding bosses and traders with cash for short-term results. In some cases, such as Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, chief executives became multimillionaires while leading their companies to the edge of collapse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2016/aug/09/theresa-may-should-stick-to-her-guns-on-executive-pay-and-low-pay-alike\">Theresa May should stick to her guns on executive pay and low pay alike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the finance industry, bonuses peaked as a share of total pay in 2008 at 34%. The equivalent figure was 22.7% last year, down from 23.1% the year before. In other sectors, bonuses were 4.5% of total pay last year \u2013 the highest level since the ONS started its calculations in 2000.</p> <p>Oliver Parry, Head of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors, said bonuses could be a useful incentive for staff, but warned caution was necessary with financial sector bonuses and that the scale of payouts should be linked closely to performance: \u201cFirms have to be very careful in areas like financial products that they don\u2019t create a culture which encourages staff to behave unethically, as we saw with PPI mis-selling. </p> <p>\u201cA separate question is the use of performance-related pay for senior executives, where there have been problems. A few thousand pounds for an employee who hits their targets is one thing, but multi-million bonuses and share awards for CEOs where company performance has not been outstanding, such as we saw at BP, anger shareholders and employees alike.\u201d </p> <p>The ONS said bonuses as a percentage of total pay were 6% for the whole economy, a small increase on the previous financial year. </p>",

It identified three phases of support: helping host nations prepare before large numbers of people arrived; providing support to tackle long-standing issues such as health and education; and helping to create jobs.<br></p> <p>It added that unlike economic migrants moving to places where there were jobs, the forcibly displaced were fleeing conflict and violence, often suffering from a loss of assets, lack of legal rights and a lack of opportunity. \u201cThey need dedicated support to overcome these vulnerabilities and regain confidence in their future \u2026 so they can work, send their children to school and have access to services,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Kim has made tackling the causes of the refugee crisis a key priority for his tenure at the World Bank, and is expected to build on this report with initiatives to boost the economic prospects of displaced people.</p>",
  "<p>Environmental destruction and landgrabs could lead to governments and individuals being prosecuted for crimes against humanity by the international criminal court following a decision to expand its remit.<br></p> <p>The UN-backed court, which sits in The Hague, has mostly ruled on cases of genocide and war crimes since it was set up in 2002.

He also said, however, that any post-Brexit deal should preclude agreements to privatise public services and should not feature current rules on a ban on state aid for industries that not all EU members abided by.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just making the point that in our relationship with the European market, whatever form it is \u2026 we need to make sure we are not signing up to something that actually constrains governments in the future,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Corbyn also reiterated some of the ideas floated during his battle against Owen Smith for the Labour leadership. He called for a programme of national investment in infrastructure and training, and an emphasis on scientific research and nation-wide high-speed broadband.</p> <p>He also said the changing global economic situation presented \u201ca deep challenge to the social democratic and socialist tradition of which Labour, new or old, has always been a part\u201d. He added: \u201cIt punctures the old belief that it was possible simply to redistribute the proceeds [of] a growing economy to pay for public services. It can no longer credibly be argued, for the majority of people, that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity. A future Labour government will have to do more than redistribute income and wealth. It will have to focus on how we earn that income and wealth in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Other ideas floated in the speech included giving each new recipient of a national insurance number details on how to join a trade union, and a \u201cPhilip Green law\u201d to curb dividends and set rules on adding debt to companies.</p> <p>This was \u201can alternative to the drift and decay of the Tories\u201d, Corbyn said, adding: \u201cWe can and we will rebuild and transform this economy so that no one and no community is left behind.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn is seen as increasingly likely to defeat Smith in the leadership contest. The result is due to be announced on 24 September just before the start of Labour\u2019s annual conference. </p> <p>On Thursday the bookmaker William Hill said it had received a \u00a360,000 bet on Corbyn to win at odds of 1/16, and had now trimmed the odds to 1/25.</p>",
  "<p>China is set for a central role in Britain\u2019s nuclear industry after the government gave the go-ahead for a new power station at Hinkley Point.</p> <p>The Chinese company involved in the \u00a318bn project plans to submit a design for a nuclear power station in Essex within weeks.

May was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">said to have</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\"> had concerns about Chinese involvement</a> in such a sensitive project.</p> <p>However, it is understood that as part of the government approving Hinkley Point C it has assured CGN that its plans for Bradwell are still welcome.</p> <p>Sources close to the Chinese state-backed company said it intended to formally submit plans to the regulator to build its own nuclear reactor at Bradwell soon, potentially within weeks and almost certainly this autumn.</p> <p>CGN is understood to be confident about winning approval for its plans for Bradwell, although the review process for proposed power stations can take years. It is also ready to press ahead with proposals for another power station at Sizewell in Suffolk.</p> <p>If approved, the plants would give CGN a pivotal role in providing Britain with energy for the next generation. This is despite May insisting on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">\u201crevised agreement\u201d for Hinkley Point C</a> and the government pledging to take a special share in future nuclear projects to protect national security.<br></p> <p>CGN said: \u201cWe are delighted that the British government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy.</p> <p>\u201cCGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years\u2019 experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK\u2019s future energy needs.\u201d</p> <p>Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, chief executive of EDF, said the government\u2019s decision \u201cmarks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe\u201d.</p> <p>CGN\u2019s role in Bradwell B and Sizewell C were agreed with EDF in return for investing in Hinkley Point C. While EDF owns two-thirds of Hinkley Point C and CGN owns a third, this is likely to be reversed for Bradwell. It is intended that EDF will have an 80% share in Sizewell, with CGN holding the rest.</p> <p>China\u2019s investment in nuclear power stations has attracted a mixed response. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said the funding of new power stations should be separated from the design. </p> <p>He said: \u201cWith Hinkley now confirmed, attention must rightly shift to the other new nuclear power stations \u2013 including Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell in Suffolk \u2013 which we badly need across the country. The solution, however, is not to hand over the replacement of vital UK infrastructure lock, stock and barrel to China. </p> <p>\u201cGMB strongly cautions that the funding of nuclear developments should always be kept totally separate from the regulation of the design and construction of new nuclear facilities and the transport and safeguarding of nuclear and radioactive materials. Chinese pop-up power stations are not a solution on their own.\u201d </p> <p>However, business leaders welcomed the investment in Britain\u2019s infrastructure and the introduction of a special share to protect national security. The changes to the Hinkley Point C deal mean the government will be able to block EDF selling its controlling stake in the project and have more influence over future developments.</p> <p>Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe government is right to grasp the nettle to remove the potential for uncertainty surrounding a future sale by seeking a \u2018golden share\u2019 in critical infrastructure projects.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a well-considered approach to balance foreign investment, which the UK needs, against an uncertain future. This is an important dynamic to consider, especially in the context of critical infrastructure projects where decisions on ownership could have direct implications for businesses being able to operate.\u201d</p> <p>A so-called golden share in Hinkley Point C was first muted by the Liberal Democrats when they were in government. However, George Osborne, then the chancellor, is understood to have opposed it. EDF has previously signalled that it could reduce its stake in the project to 50% by bringing in other investors.</p> <p>CGN could also include fellow Chinese-stated backed energy company CNNC. However, Nick Timothy, May\u2019s joint chief of staff, pointed out in an article for ConservativeHome last year that CNNC stated on its website that it was responsible not just for \u201cincreasing the value of state assets and developing the society\u201d but the \u201cbuilding of national defence\u201d. </p> <p>Timothy claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to \u201cshut down Britain\u2019s energy production at will\u201d and argued against giving a \u201chostile state\u201d access to the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>When the architectural historian Peter Blundell Jones, who has died aged 67 of cancer, was a student, one building that was much in favour was the prize-winning, technology-led Centre Pompidou in Paris (1971). All the services were visible on the outside, and celebrated in form and colour.</p> <p>This was a prototype of a kind of universal building and a systemic approach to architecture that Peter rejected, because it did not take account of social, historical or physical context.</p> <p>He had entered the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture in London at the age of 17 in 1966, and found it a hotbed of radical ideas. The Archigram group was drawing on technology to envision a neofuturistic world that was expressed solely through hypothetical projects. At the same time, the young Charles Jencks was tutoring there, with Peter among his students, and developing the ideas for his influential book The Language of Post-Modern Architecture (1977). The partial collapse of the Ronan Point tower block in Newham, east London, in 1968 seemed to symbolise a failure of modernism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f42f15ec67e704300ad5b8e62e80ac4234669b74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f42f15ec67e704300ad5b8e62e80ac4234669b74/232_348_1533_1915/801.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Blundell Jones celebrated the depth and complexity of the modern movement.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Blundell Jones celebrated the depth and complexity of the modern movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Woudstra/University of Sheffield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the AA Peter also encountered a wide range of German modernism. One of the lecturers, Thomas Stevens, used a villa by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Bernhard-Scharoun\" title=\"\">Hans Scharoun</a> and a cowshed by Hugo H\u00e4ring to demonstrate what he saw as a deficient approach to design, in that they had started from resolving how people use a building and move through and around it. Stevens dismissed the type of architecture that arose from it as \u201cthrowing walls up around the circulation pattern\u201d. Yet to Peter these buildings had an immediate visual appeal, and represented more than anything \u201cthe freedom and transparency promised by the modern movement\u201d.</p> <p>Rather than focus on the buildings conventionally presented as exemplars of the modern movement and celebrated for their technological advancements, he became more interested in exploring the messy context of the relationship with people. In his own words, he became interested in \u201cthe irregular, in accumulated layers, in freehand, in the wrinkles of the ground, in place, in history, in participation, in spaces with which one could identify and where one could comfortably dwell\u201d.</p> <p>In his first book, Hans Scharoun (1978), derived from a thesis written at the AA, Peter provided an alternative reading of modernism, revealing a freedom of design liberated from the need to use right angles and thereby recovering \u201cthe choice of direction\u201d. It brought home a need to articulate \u201ccontent to make recognisable territories\u201d, as well as the necessity for a response to site, neighbours and terrain. These were the guiding principles that were to determine Peter\u2019s outlook and research.</p> <p>The German designers whose work he warmed to had thus far been marginalised in published histories of the modern movement, and Peter\u2019s work on Scharoun was therefore pioneering. He soon expanded his range to other architects who worked in similar fashions, including H\u00e4ring, Alvar Aalto and Gunnar Asplund, while also investigating a younger generation who used these context-led approaches, such as Giancarlo De Carlo, Peter H\u00fcbner, Enric Miralles and Lucien Kroll.</p> <p>While his publications provided a new perspective on alternative strands of modernism, he became conscious that they only adjusted the existing canon of modernist heroes. To provide a different reading and to celebrate the depth and complexity of the modern movement, Peter later settled on a case-study approach, focusing on individual buildings. This resulted in two volumes of Modern Architecture Through Case Studies (2002 and 2007), the second a collaboration with Eamonn Canniffe. They provide evidence \u201cfor the suppressed traditions and diversity in the modern movement\u201d.</p> <p>He always placed the human experience to the fore, and examined how that affected the relationship with the physical environment. With me, he produced a series of articles entitled Some Modernist Houses and Their Gardens, exploring how the inside and outdoors were connected. This approach also led to the books Architecture and Participation (2005), with Doina Petrescu and Jeremy Till, and Architecture and Movement: The Dynamic Experience of Buildings and Landscapes (2015), with Mark Meagher.</p> <p>Architecture and Ritual (2016) explores \u201chow the rituals of life \u2013 from the grand to the mundane and everyday \u2013 are framed and defined in space by the buildings which we inhabit\u201d. It connects anthropology and architecture, commencing with a series of international cases that show \u201cthe creative diversity of a more broadly conceived modernism\u201d. Peter illustrated how daily and other rituals were and continue to be central to the shaping of our environment. The book demonstrated that he was eager to share his ideas, arguments and insights, and open out beyond the narrowly defined boundaries of the professions.</p> <p>Besides his writing, he also left some buildings, such as the Round House at Stoke Canon, Devon, which was his parents\u2019 home, and the refurbished Padley Mill, Grindleford, Derbyshire. These show their pedigree in the more human side of modernism.</p> <p>Peter, the second of three children, was born near Exeter, where his father, Geoffrey, was an orthopaedic surgeon, and his mother, Avis (nee Dyer), a GP. He attended an Exeter preparatory school and Blundell\u2019s school, Tiverton.</p> <p>After he left the AA in 1972, he was commissioned to write the book on Scharoun. He then designed and built the Round House, and taught for a year at the North London Polytechnic and the University of Bath while also writing for the Architectural Review and Architectural Journal.</p> <p>Peter was an assistant lecturer at Cambridge University (1979-83) and from 1988 a principal lecturer and then reader at the South London Polytechnic. In 1992 he was named architectural journalist of the year. In 1994 he was appointed professor at the University of Sheffield School of Architecture.</p> <p>His first wife, Rosalind (nee Barron), whom he married in 1979, died in 1989. He is survived by his second wife, Christine (nee Poulson), whom he married in 1994, and their daughter, Anna, and by the two children from his first marriage, Timothy and Claire.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Blundell Jones, architectural historian, born 4 January 1949; died 19 August 2016</p>",
  "<h2> But nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make</h2> <p>Well, we have an answer. Each week on this blog, I have posted the same question: where is Tyrell Wellick? The E Corp executive was Mr Robot\u2019s central villain in its early episodes, then disappeared at the climax of season one. He had exposed Elliot Alderson as the head of f.society and demanded access to their group. Elliot had escorted him to the abandoned arcade f.soc called home and then, nothing. A gap. A hole. A blank. When we next saw Elliot, neither we nor he had any clue where Wellick was and what had happened to him. And that\u2019s how it has stayed, until now.<br></p> <p>With one more episode of this season to go, we find that Wellick is alive and well and walking through Manhattan with Elliot. Not only is he alive, he\u2019s totally on top of developments in the global power struggle that f.soc\u2019s grand hack of E Corp unleashed. More than that: he looks positively spiffing, with a wonderful jawline and an immaculate suit. What\u2019s that you say? You don\u2019t believe Wellick is really there? Well, it depends what you mean by \u201creal\u201d, doesn\u2019t it.</p> <p>I\u2019m paraphrasing Whiterose there, of which more later, but the conclusion you may have drawn from the reappearance of our favourite Scandinavian scumbag is that, actually, he\u2019s a figment of Elliot\u2019s imagination. Or, at least, another facet of his Dissociative Identity Disorder. Just as Mr Robot embodies Elliot\u2019s id, his assertive, untrammelled side, perhaps this Wellick is Elliot\u2019s encryptor. Everything that must be kept secret, the most vital of information, is stored in Wellick until needed. And now is the time for access.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0441d45e434b2f8ee6e14409899ce7ab172f4e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0441d45e434b2f8ee6e14409899ce7ab172f4e59/0_40_839_503/500.jpg\" alt=\"Our favourite Scandinavian scumbag makes a reappearance.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Our favourite Scandinavian scumbag makes a reappearance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, that\u2019s one theory. It could be that Wellick is real, that the cab driver had seen him but didn\u2019t have the English to tell Elliot that. That the weird Casablanca reference \u2013 \u201cthis is the start of a beautiful friendship\u201d \u2013 was Wellick trying out a new-found sense of humour. But if I was a gambling man (and in crypto-currency, obviously), I would say he\u2019s dead. He\u2019s dead and buried someplace only \u201cTyrell Wellick\u201d knows. But \u201cTyrell Wellick\u201d won\u2019t say, because he has things to do.</p> <h2> And the eyes in his head See the world spinning round</h2> <p>My suspicion is that next week we will find out what Stage Two is. It\u2019s the plan we thought belonged to the Dark Army and was then revealed to be known by Elliot but may, after all, be a plot by the Chinese government. Or maybe it\u2019s all three. Certainly this episode blurred the logic of the drama even more than usual, to the extent that I am genuinely befuddled.</p> <p>So bear with me as I try to untangle some thoughts on Elliot and his dissociative personalities. His mantra, \u201cmind awake, body asleep\u201d has hinted that Mr Robot is active when Elliot is not. We then see Elliot emerge from his slumbers and watch Mr Robot crack a code that, if the \u201cTyrell Wellick\u201d theory is true, was set by Elliot in the first place. Currently Elliot can see Mr Robot but can\u2019t talk to him, which is an inversion of their earlier relationship where Mr Robot would be present to Elliot in order to instruct him. This is also a change on last week, where he couldn\u2019t see him at all, and came after Elliot expressed a desire to be a \u201csilent observer\u201d.</p> <p>This is where it gets interesting. Elliot wishes to be a silent observer, like the friend he talks to in his head. I have long presumed that that friend is me, or \u201cthe viewer\u201d, but I assumed I had a passive role in what was happening, certainly when it became clear that Elliot had lied to me/us more than once, and certainly about prison. It\u2019s also the case that there are times when only I/we can see Mr Robot. When he walks through the night market we can see Mr Robot wending his way towards Wellick, while for a time Elliott cannot. If we hadn\u2019t seen Mr Robot, would Elliot have known where to go? Are we, actually, a vital component in keeping Elliot on the road, keeping his fragmented realities together? And does that apply to situations, or \u201cscenes\u201d, when Elliot isn\u2019t present at all?</p> <p>Makes u think \u2026</p> <h2>Well on the way, his head in a cloud</h2> <p>This questioning of reality brings us back to Whiterose, who has kidnapped Angela and locked her in the suburbs (at least we think he has etc). Having already reprised Blossom and the Fresh Prince in episode six, creator Sam Esmail this week chose to give us a little taste of Twin Peaks by detaining Angela in a room containing a fish tank and an outmoded computer. Then having her interrogated by a child. </p> <p>I won\u2019t try to make sense of the questioning: \u201chave you ever cried during sex?\u201d \u201cis the key in the room?\u201d \u2013 and I certainly won\u2019t try to read the significance of the paperback copy of Lolita on the table. In fact, this was one of the many great scenes in Mr Robot where it\u2019s best just to enjoy the moment. The mise en scene was beautifully done, very Lynchian but not too far away from Kubrick\u2019s war room neither. The camera work was delicious too, wider shots of Angela and her interrogator being replaced by close up when White Rose enters the room (the thumping vein on her neck hypnotised me). Then there were the retro bleeps of Whiterose\u2019s timer, both ridiculous and menacing, and the high-flown rhetoric of the Dark Army leader, as intriguing as it is enigmatic. \u201cYour mother and [Elliot\u2019s] father gave their lives to take humanity to the next level\u201d, he tells Angela. What does that mean? I hope and believe we\u2019ll find out soon. <br></p> <h2>They can tell what he wants to do</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74f7a42a0087c2f74fd1735ea83026d099640d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74f7a42a0087c2f74fd1735ea83026d099640d20/0_5_881_529/500.jpg\" alt=\"The E-Coin takeover \u2026 Philip Price\u2019s endgame.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The E-Coin takeover \u2026 Philip Price\u2019s endgame.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You lot in the comments and, to a lesser extent, your humble blogger, have been good at spotting plot developments coming down the road.

In an exchange with the treasury minister that went right over my head, Price promised transparency in return for effectively becoming an alternative central bank, funded by the Chinese state. Nice deal if you can get it. More on that next week I fancy.</p> <p>Finally, a piece of good news. Agent Santiago might not be a Dark Army stooge. His reluctance to help Dom DiPierro in her investigations has seemed fishy to date, but here he seems to have come round to her way of thinking and offers apparently honest advice on how to pursue her inquiries. \u201cWe have to find a way to walk between the mines and not stand on them,\u201d he says.

And there will be a full team in place to take on this government and provide very effective opposition. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>John McDonnell said the Corbyn team has apologised for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs. </strong>Asked if it was right to release it, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will be meeting with all our MPs on any of the issues of concern to them, of course we will. That release came from the campaign. It didn\u2019t come from Jeremy. And we\u2019ve apologised. It was just inappropriate. One of our researchers saw a bit of incoming flak and then did a list of all the statements that have been made by other MPs, some of which were not particularly kind, let\u2019s put it that way. It was a briefing note. It shouldn\u2019t have gone out. And we apologised for that.</p> <p>It certainly was not a list in any way to attack anyone. It was just a factual report.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell said that he was \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d about the release of the list because the Corbyn team are \u201crebuilding relations\u201d with Corbyn\u2019s critics. He says almost the whole PLP (parliamentary Labour party) backed Corbyn\u2019s stance in PMQs yesterday on grammar schools. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The thing about last night, that going out, it just set us back. And I was furious about that, to be frank, absolutely furious. And just at a time when we were rebuilding relations. I hope it hasn\u2019t set us back. And we will certainly have a conversation with all those involved.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he never resorted to using abusive comments himself.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I, as you know, never abuse anybody, tempting as it sometimes is. And I don\u2019t respond to unkind remarks that I understand are sometimes thrown in my direction because I believe politics is far too important for that. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell insisted that<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/15/john-mcdonnell-welcomed-the-financial-crash-and-called-himself-a/\"> a comment he was recorded making in 2013 saying that as Marxist he approved of the financial crash</a> was a joke.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a joke.

Here are the key points</p> <ul> <li><strong>Coyle accused Corbyn of \u201cdefamation\u201d and said he was \u201clivid\u201d about being singled out in this way.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All I know is that the leader of my party has gone out of his way to issue a statement accusing my of abuse with no detail, no forewarning, no explanation of what I\u2019m accused of. I won a seat back for Labour last year after 30 years. I should be out this morning with the CWU in my constituency campaigning to keep a post office. And instead I\u2019m trying to work out what I\u2019m accused of and how to defend myself from defamation by my own party leader.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He accused Corbyn and his allies of effectively encouraging people to abuse MPs on line.</strong> Labour members should respond by voting for Owen Smith in the leadership contest, he said. He claimed that a third of members have yet to vote.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The release of this list, and the victim culture it is trying to perpetuate, is an example of how nervous [Corbyn] is, and his team are, about the result. I think a third of members are yet to even vote in this. And Jeremy and his team know they have put a lot of people off through their incompetence over the last year who do not want to vote for them again this time around.</p> <p>For those members who have not voted yet, this is another demonstration of the kind of lack of leadership, the kind of division, that Jeremy and John McDonnell want to perpetuate if they win again. And look at the permissive culture they have created of abuse against Labour MPs, and especially women MPs.</p> <p>Jess Phillips has had months and months of abuse, a torrent of abuse, from Corbynistas and the like. And she has been put on this list again. That is a dereliction of duty. That is not leadership. That is Jeremy telling his trolls online to carry on. He is giving them a green light to continue their abuse. If Labour members don\u2019t want that abuse to continue, they really need to choose Owen [Smith] while they\u2019ve still got a chance in this leadership election.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would be talking to a lawyer about possible legal action.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve already asked for an explanation from Jeremy, I\u2019ve already been in touch with the chief whip\u2019s office, I have already been in touch with the party chair and the general secretary of the party. I do want an answer and I will be speaking to a lawyer tomorrow.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for a written apology from Corbyn. That would help resolve the matter, he said.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly rejected the claim that he had been abusive towards Corbyn</strong>. He said the only thing he could think of that led to his being included on the list was the fact that he wrote<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-labour-mps-elections\"> a joint article for the Guardian after the May elections with Jo Cox, the Labour MP killed in the summer, saying Labour needed to do much better.</a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If that is an attack on the leader, then he\u2019s really in desperate times.</p> </blockquote> <p>Coyle also said that he did not engage in anonymous briefing. If he had something to say, he said it openly, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed it was hypocritical of Corbyn to refuse to accept criticism given his own record as a backbencher.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy was the most rebellious backbencher for 30 years and yet somehow - it\u2019s utter hypocrisy really - does not like it when his own backbenchers disagree with him. Instead of challenges, instead of having a debate with us, he goes out and issues a silly little list like they did in January instead of having a debate and building that policy platform that we need to win.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He particularly criticised the decision to include Ben Bradshaw on the list. </strong>Bradshaw was the only Labour MP in the south west, he said. Corbyn should be \u201cworking with Ben to work out why Ben has been so successful in Exeter, why Ben has been a good MP for that constituency\u201d instead of putting him on the list, Coyle said.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff190ccc049ccf0a52abc8ecf83c7846d81b6377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff190ccc049ccf0a52abc8ecf83c7846d81b6377/60_0_762_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Coyle.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Coyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da6518e4b0e813b694d3c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T09:12:43.241Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On Twitter, in response to a question about the threat she has received (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/15/may-approves-hinkley-point-but-with-new-safeguards-over-foreign-nuclear-investment-politics-live?page=with:block-57da5d20e4b067ad30087ebd#block-57da5d20e4b067ad30087ebd\"> 9.40am)</a>, <strong>Jess Phillips</strong> says she is not even Jewish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessphillips/status/776325544547876864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/beastynewall\">@beastynewall</a> no I&#39;m not Jewish but apparently I&#39;m being controlled by the evil zionist press lobby</p>&mdash; Jess Phillips MP (@jessphillips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessphillips/status/776325544547876864\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da605fe4b05caf65ecd688\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T09:01:03.067Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former EU chief says 'serious' Brexit talks will not be able to start for another year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Herman van Rompuy, </strong>the former president of the European council, gave an interview to the Today programme this morning.

China is a minority investor in Hinkley Point, but it is investing as part of a deal that will also see it play a minority role in building a new nuclear power station at Sizewell, in Suffolk, and that will also see it take the lead in building a new nuclear plant at Bradwell, in Essex. For the Chinese Bradwell is the real prize because they believe that establishing successful Chinese-designed nuclear power station in the UK will lead to them breaking into many other markets in the West.</p> <p>May was concerned about giving control of a nuclear power station to a potentially hostile foreign power.

In India, we have licensed GM cotton traits to 49 seed companies offering over 1,000 locally adapted seed types, enabling farmer choice and providing farmers across the country access to an immensely beneficial technology.</p> <p>The government of India\u2019s recent intervention <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/government-caps-royalty-fee-on-new-gm-cotton-traits-at-10/articleshow/52365690.cms\" title=\"\">unilaterally reducing GM trait fees</a> and introducing draft licensing guidelines is against the backdrop of a dispute between Monsanto and a few seed companies. The government\u2019s reduction in trait fees does not translate into benefits for farmers, but adds to the profits of seed companies, which have lobbied with other vested interests to create an environment that allows them to maximise their profits at the cost of farmers\u2019 long-term prospects and technology access.</p> <p>These interventions have created significant uncertainty in the Indian business environment around respect for intellectual property rights and the status of private contracts. The impact is not limited to Monsanto, but also affects Indian companies engaged in research and development. A supportive, predictable policy and business environment that respects intellectual property rights on patented technologies and the sanctity of private contracts can encourage long-term investments to create the new tools and technologies that Indian farmers need.</p> <p>Finding solutions for smallholders is complicated: it requires local knowledge and an appreciation of the challenges farmers face. If the Guardian wishes to encourage development of farming tools that can help smallholders be more sustainable and improve agriculture overall, please call for science-based, inclusive and consistent decision-making from governments.<br><strong>Mark Buckingham</strong> <br><em>Monsanto UK</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

It echoed something that Simpson said locating the trend to the north-east of England. </p> <p>\u201cThe north-east was carpet-bombed by Thatcherism in the 80s,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/news/a7588/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-spornosexual/\">Esquire</a> \u201cCoal and shipbuilding disappeared and were replaced by shopping, service industries, gyms and tanning salons.\u201d</p> <p> In February, when singer Sam Smith debuted his new, svelte figure on Instagram the comments were full of opinions about how he should look (\u201cHe got wayyy too thin\u201d; \u201dHe was hotter when he was fat\u201d). Such ill-meaning banter illustrated a new truth: people\u2019s idea of the \u201cideal\u201d male body has never been clearer, and that can only be problematic thing. </p>",
  "<p>Blink and you\u2019ll miss it, but Ron Howard\u2019s intensely enjoyable documentary about the Beatles\u2019 touring years has a great surreal moment at the very beginning. The moptops are getting out of the plane in New York, on their way to a date with destiny on The Ed Sullivan Show, and the newsreel camera briefly catches a couple of placards held up in the huge airport crowd. \u201cBeatles Unfair 2 Bald Men\u201d reads one, and another says: \u201cEngland Get Out of Ireland.\u201d The images vanish, and their atypical sentiments are in any case drowned by the global scream of unironic adulation. Yet both echo other undercurrents in Beatlemania: a fear of these weirdly attractive aliens, a hatred of youth culture and youth itself, and perhaps mixed feelings in New York and the US about this extraordinary new British invasion. Maybe Paul McCartney even saw that second placard and modified it as a song title for Wings.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/06/the-beatles-eight-days-a-week-the-touring-years-exclusive-clip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xpxj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2695159\"            data-video-name=\"The Beatles: Eight Days A Week - The Touring Years: exclusive clip \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Other\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ce8b44e4b0456abb93dbe1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160905EightDaysBeatles_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160905EightDaysBeatles_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160905EightDaysBeatles.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/06/the-beatles-eight-days-a-week-the-touring-years-exclusive-clip-video\">The Beatles: Eight Days A Week - The Touring Years: exclusive clip \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Is there really anything more to say about the Beatles? Well, Howard gives us a movie conceived on similar lines to his non-fiction features such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/17/apollo-13-tom-hanks-space-ron-howard\">Apollo 13</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/03/forst-nixon-reel-history-ron-howard\">Frost/Nixon</a>, real people tested in the fire of publicity, with the same classic narrative arc of personal growth. Yet he persuades you that there might be something new to say, in a film that includes interviews with the two surviving members McCartney and Ringo Starr, archive material with Harrison and Lennon, and intriguing conversations with present-day fans such as Elvis Costello, Whoopi Goldberg and Malcolm Gladwell (whose 2008 book Outliers brings the Beatles\u2019 Hamburg years into his theory that greatness takes 10,000 hours of practice).</p> <p>Howard\u2019s film has a different emphasis from, say, Ian MacDonald\u2019s critical classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/17/revolution-in-the-head-by-ian-macdonald-a-song-by-song-history-of-the-beatles\">Revolution in the Head</a>, which was explicitly about the Beatles\u2019 recordings. This is about the Beatles as live phenomenon, and the fact that their music was all the more remarkable because it had to be heard above the scream \u2013 that ambient sound of sex, excitement and modernity, mixed in with a thin chirrup of press envy. The scream was an important part of it. There are many familiar scenes of the Beatles being unsure, in venues such as Shea Stadium, as to whether they could even be heard at all. And the film demonstrates that the sound system, such as it was, was just the stadium\u2019s PA speakers. What the fans heard was a thin and tinny travesty. But that was hardly the point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38f7c6135c550a698505f8255031102ab8c2211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38f7c6135c550a698505f8255031102ab8c2211/578_384_3518_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can you hear us? \u2026 the Shea stadium concert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can you hear us? \u2026 the Shea stadium concert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SubaFilms</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/13/beatles-eight-days-week-ron-howard\">Eight Days A Week: how Ron Howard brought the Beatles back to life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eight Days a Week is about what amounted to an almost unbroken four-year, semi-improvised multimedia performance for which there was no pre-existing template \u2013 not simply the music but the giant public spectacle and public scrutiny, the theatre of arriving at airports, hotels, posing for incessant photographs, and most challengingly of all, talking to journalists. With wit and good humour far in advance of anything being shown by the press corps, the Beatles came up with snappy but good-natured replies to the questions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/eddie-izzard\">Eddie Izzard</a> interestingly comments on their style. All too clearly, with pointed questions about how long the group expected all this to go on, the press was waiting for a comeuppance. Eventually it came, with John Lennon\u2019s remarks about the Beatles being bigger than Christianity. Not in the US Bible belt they weren\u2019t. (A more accurate blasphemy would be to say they were bigger than Shakespeare.) The row soured the exhausted Beatles\u2019 already darkening mood and it was time to quit touring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f369dd55506c42d88188a53a709ec979176a44b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f369dd55506c42d88188a53a709ec979176a44b0/0_1098_6864_4117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With George Martin at Abbey Road studios.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With George Martin at Abbey Road studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple Corps</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an age before social media, the Beatles could do and say almost anything they wanted to without it rebounding. A wave of euphoria and happiness pours from the screen, and Howard\u2019s movie surfs that wave. If there is a flaw in the film, it is that it somehow fails to notice the Beatles\u2019 wives. Three of them were married or got married in this period, and Linda Eastman met Paul towards the end of this time. Surely their domestic lives were part of what complicated their brotherhood and made their eternal boyhood on the road untenable.</p> <p>There is a lot of simple, moment-by-moment pleasure to be had here. Howard dishes up familiar archive footage but new material as well: in particular, their final performance in Candlestick Park, San Francisco. The Beatles\u2019 cherubic faces are strangely compelling: they did indeed look like intergalactic creatures who found a home on our planet.</p>",
  "<p>Yes, I still believe that nuclear power can make a useful contribution to low-carbon energy. No, I do not believe that the new plant the government has just approved at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">Hinkley Point</a> is part of that useful contribution. Far from it: this preposterous white elephant could scarcely be better designed to persuade people that nuclear energy is an expensive and dangerous distraction from the decisions we have to make.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start where all such discussions should start: at the most important place. The overwhelming priority for those who make decisions about energy must be to avert climate breakdown. They need to keep the lights on, but not by sacrificing the future welfare of humanity and Earth\u2019s living systems. It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. It is also better to curse the darkness than to burn your house down.</p> <p>Nuclear power, whatever its detractors might claim, is a low-carbon energy source, roughly comparable to renewables in terms of total emissions. To shut down viable nuclear capacity in the midst of a climate change emergency (now, in other words), as Germany and Japan have done, is a refined form of madness, especially when at least some of that capacity is likely to be replaced by gas or coal, whose carbon emissions are much higher. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables, on the timescale in which we need to act, is hard enough, without setting yourself the additional, unnecessary challenge of also replacing nuclear power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc333d5160d1b033222c4f00e2fff0fc37e9fbd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc333d5160d1b033222c4f00e2fff0fc37e9fbd1/1013_613_2136_1281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Security staff block a road leading to the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan.

The dangers of radioactive discharge and nuclear accidents have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/05/anti-nuclear-lobby-misled-world\">systematically exaggerated</a> by campaigners. As a result, the dangers of fossil fuel burning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/16/nuclear-scare-stories-coal-industry\">have been implicitly downgraded</a>.</p> <p>Remember that even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima disaster</a>, a level 7 nuclear accident (the highest category), caused by a massive earthquake and tidal wave hitting an antiquated reactor, has so far killed no one as a result of radioactive discharge, and is <a href=\"http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2013/unisinf475.html\">unlikely to do so in the future</a>. Fossil fuel burning, by contrast, kills hundreds of thousands of people every year through air pollution, and presents a possibly existential threat to civilisation through climate change.</p> <p>But keeping viable plants open and replacing a superannuated nuclear fleet with new plants are slightly different decisions. In the latter case, governments have to decide two things: whether nuclear power is the best means of replacing the low-carbon energy the old plants were producing and, if so, which nuclear technology should best be adopted.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that Theresa May\u2019s government has taken the wrong decision \u2013 it does not appear to have made a decision at all. It has simply adopted the proposal on the table, without subjecting it to a serious comparison with the alternatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/flamanville-france-edf-nuclear-reactor-hinkley-point-c\">Flamanville: France's beleaguered forerunner to Hinkley Point C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are several problems with the Hinkley C proposal but the most immediate is this: it could be unbuildable.

In the UK, the Internet Watch Foundation has faced similar criticism for keeping secret its list of websites that internet service providers must block.</p> <p>Martin describes the firewall as voluntary, so there will be no need for legislation.

Specifically, they expect business spending to slow more sharply than consumer spending in response to this uncertainty.

Nor will it entirely convince Beijing of London\u2019s continued commitment to the golden friendship. </p> <p>For China, the key will be whether Downing Street allows it to follow up its involvement in Hinkley by helping build a second nuclear plant in Sizewell, Suffolk, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 its own Chinese-designed plant in Bradwell, Essex.</p> <p>The latter project would allow Beijing to show off its nuclear prowess to the rest of the world and is considered the real prize for China\u2019s communist leaders. </p> <p>The state-owned China General Nuclear Power said it was \u201cdelighted that the British government has decided to proceed.

Rather, it said \u201csignificant new safeguards\u201d would be introduced for future foreign investment in critical infrastructure.</p> <p>Steve Tsang, an expert in China politics at the University of Nottingham, said Beijing would now be \u201clooking very hard\u201d at the implications of these new conditions, \u201cnot so much about Hinkley but about Bradwell, which is the real deal for China.\u201d </p> <p>The nature of those conditions would determine whether the UK-China romance continued to blossom or was consigned to the scrap heap, he predicted. \u201cA negative decision on Bradwell will mean the \u2018golden era\u2019 will not last.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Christy Yao in Beijing </em></p>",

  "<h2>Laura Mvula \u2013 The Dreaming Room</h2> <p>The best moments of Laura Mvula\u2019s 2013 debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/28/laura-mvula-sing-moon-review\">Sing to the Moon</a> seemed to suggest the arrival of a unique talent \u2013 certainly more so than its advance billing as a Radio 2-friendly retro soul album. But its follow-up really bears that promise out. There hasn\u2019t been another album released in the last 12 months that\u2019s even remotely like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/16/laura-mvula-dreaming-room-cd-review\">The Dreaming Room</a>: it exists in a world entirely of its own. The album\u2019s serpentine tunes thread their way through 36 minutes of strange, heady musical juxtapositions: explosive vocal harmonies, baroque classical ornamentation, off-centre funk, leftfield hip-hop, psychedelic R&amp;B. The music is richly, seductively melodic without really using choruses or hooks; the songs seem to slowly unfurl before you; the lyrics \u2013 and Mvula\u2019s delivery of them \u2013 are both poignant and painful. It sounds like pop music floating free from the standard rules of pop music, heading into uncharted territory. <strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mvula\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6CUIs9W7jJk0gtb5VzHlJ6\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Anonhi \u2013 Hopelessness</strong></h2> <p>If PJ Harvey can scoop an award twice, including one for her baroque protest album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/10/pj-harvey-let-england-shake-review\">Let England Shake</a>, then there\u2019s room for another second-time winner and for another album that takes aim at the world. Anonhi\u2019s Hopelessness eviscerates with bittersweet sharpness, constituting surely the most ambitious songs of 2016\u2019s shortlist \u2013 tackling war, climate change, murky politics and violence. They have an emotional range that spans lacerating anger and heart-clutching despair, underpinned by futuristic and expansive soundscapes from producers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/14/hudson-mohawke-kanye-west-producer\">Hudson Mohawke</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/26/oneohtrix-point-never-garden-of-delete-review\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. The opening track, Drone Bomb Me \u2013 a longing ballad from the perspective of a civilian beckoning a fatal drone strike \u2013 cuts deep. Climate change banger (a new musical genre?) 4 Degrees is another engulfing listen that sounds as if it is swooping over epic landscapes, with Anonhi\u2019s stark falsetto contrasting perfectly with Mohawke\u2019s signature majestic horns. Hopelessness is the only strictly electronic album this year but it\u2019s also the only album brave enough to take on the bigger picture. That\u2019s something to be hopeful for.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Kate Hutchinson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Anonhi\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A1S3OY2V2ZwFh4xU7gQG6IZ\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>David Bowie \u2013 Blackstar</h2> <p>If the Mercury prize is supposed to recognise albums that capture a moment or prove somehow ahead of the game, it\u2019s no wonder Blackstar is the runaway favourite with bookmakers. Bowie\u2019s best album in more than three decades freefalls through the music that inspired him across his career \u2013 from glam to jazz to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/19/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-a-butterfly-review\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a> \u2013 and emerges as something genuinely strange, off-kilter, otherworldly and postmodern. The lyrics wrongfooted everyone until two days after the album\u2019s release, when Bowie died and it became clear that he had tdrawn on his incurable cancer and impending death in his final work of art. Blackstar is effectively a loving goodbye to the world, and songs such as Lazarus (\u201cLook at me, I\u2019m in heaven\u201d) and the sublime <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqW-kvU5cLg\">Dollar Days</a> offer insights into illness, mortality and afterlife that were designed to be listened to once the reasons for their offering had been made clear. What a way to go. <strong>Dave Simpson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bowie\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2w1YJXWMIco6EBf0CovvVN\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Skepta \u2013 Konnichiwa</h2> <p>There are two grime records on this year\u2019s Mercury shortlist: Kano\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/10/kano-made-in-the-manor-review-grime-mainstay-finds-a-reflective-maturity\">Made in the Manor</a>, which speaks to the genre\u2019s garage genes, and Skepta\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/skepta-konnichiwa-review-boy-better-know-album-of-the-week\">Konnichiwa</a>, an album that embodies its zeitgeisty present. Over the past two years, the north London rapper has managed to contribute to British culture in a way that feels truly contemporary \u2013 and made the forecast of an exclusively retromania-fuelled pop future seem just like a bad dream in the process. The real basis for that achievement is an aesthetic one. Skepta is funny, clever and spirited on Konnichiwa, but more importantly he\u2019s stylish \u2013 something evidenced by everything from his minimal, slightly vicious production to the talk of binning his naff designer clobber. This is not a case of style over substance: these days, style is substance. Now more than ever, music is a multi-channel enterprise, and as Drake and Kanye West have made clear, your aesthetic aura is an important facet of your latest release. That means Konnichiwa isn\u2019t just the most arresting album on the shortlist \u2013 it\u2019s also the most relevant, by a very long way. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rachel Aroesti</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Skepta\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2yegc4SUhhXxUXUavLHUqL\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The 1975 \u2013 I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It</h2> <p>Rock history is replete with second albums that dwell on the disaffection and disillusion that comes with being made prosperous, famous and adored. And most of those albums tend to be intensely dislikeable affairs, because those of us who are not prosperous, famous and adored tend to find it hard to see the downside to that situation. The 1975\u2019s second album could easily have fallen into that trap, but didn\u2019t, because singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/the-1975-matt-healy-no-ones-asking-you-to-inspire-revolution-interview\">Matty Healy</a> portrayed himself not as the person alienated by everyone else\u2019s shallowness, but just as shallow as everyone else, which gave the album a sense of humour: it\u2019s a crisis caused by self-knowledge rather than self-importance. On the bleakly beautiful, none-more-80s ballad A Change of Heart, he paints himself as part of a couple equally incapable of empathy: it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/29/winter-reads-bret-easton-ellis\">Less Than Zero</a> set to music, with the year\u2019s best couplet: \u201cYou said I\u2019m full of diseases, your eyes were full of regret / And then you took a picture of your salad and you put it on the internet.\u201d Healy\u2019s isn\u2019t a world of inchoate rage on the estates, but one you recognise from the teenagers you talk to: confused autodidacts trying to trace a pattern in the world (and, boy, can he write a lyric, with the band supplying tunes to match). If you want an album that captures the magpie nature of modern music \u2013 skipping between styles, borrowing from the Police, Yazoo, M83, nu soul, pop house, Bowie and scores more with alacrity \u2013 then this is the one that sounds like playlist culture brought to life. <strong>Michael Hann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The 1975\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A12zl1WmHPFCSyKYbL4vBZn\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Radiohead \u2013 A Moon Shaped Pool</h2> <p>Radiohead have now clocked up five Mercury nominations, more than any other artist. They also, rather famously, have failed to win the award in any of their previous four appearances on the shortlist, making them the Leonardo DiCaprio of credible guitar music. In fairness, you can make at least a semi-credible case for three of those losses: OK Computer was defeated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/16/roni.sixe.reprazent.final.album\">Roni Size/Reprazent</a>, crowning drum and bass\u2019s ascendancy at the time; Amnesiac lost out to PJ Harvey\u2019s sumptuous Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (Thom Yorke\u2019s appearance on that album acting as a consolation prize of sorts); and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/06/popandrock.artsfeatures\">Hail to the Thief</a> came up against the might of Dizzee Rascal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jul/18/popandrock.artsfeatures\">Boy in Da Corner</a>. All fair enough, but then in 2008 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/11/radiohead.popandrock\">In Rainbows</a> lost to Elbow\u2019s milquetoast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/14/popandrock.shopping\">The Seldom Seen Kid</a>, and suddenly their failure to win the award started to look like a bit of a slight. Now is a decent time for the Mercurys to correct that. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool</a> is Radiohead\u2019s best album in more than a decade. It\u2019s a dizzying blend of past and present, of organic textures and glitchy futurism. It\u2019s polemical, elegiac, beautiful and frequently furious. You can hum along to at least seven of the tracks on it, rather than the usual none. It has True Love bloody Waits on it. In short, it\u2019s the sound of a band at the peak of their powers. It would be a worthy winner.<strong> Gwilym Mumford</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Radiohead\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A6vuykQgDLUCiZ7YggIpLM9\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Major European oil companies and commodity traders are exploiting weak fuel standards in African countries to export highly polluting fuels that they could never sell at the pumps in Europe, according to a new report.</p> <p>The Swiss commodity traders Trafigura and Vitol are among a number of companies accused of exporting what campaigners call \u201cAfrican quality\u201d diesel, blending products in European facilities to create fuels with sulphur levels that are sometimes hundreds of times over European limits, according to a three-year research project by the Swiss NGO Public Eye.</p> <p>When the fuel is burned, the sulphur is released into the atmosphere as sulphur dioxide and other compounds that are major contributors to respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and asthma.</p> <p>Trafigura made headlines when a ship it had chartered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/trafigura-lessons-toxic-waste-dumping\">dumped toxic waste in the Ivory Coast</a> a decade ago, and the company\u2019s lawyers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/17/trafigura-minton-report-revealed\">attempted to gag the press</a> from reporting on a draft report into the incident.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/vitol-world-biggest-energy-trader-emerges-shadows\">Vitol</a>\u2019s sales last year topped $270bn.

The companies involved all deny any wrongdoing and say they comply with the law in the countries in which they operate.</p> <p>Public Eye, however, says the result is \u201cregulatory arbitrage\u201d that allows traders and fuel companies to dump cheap, dirty fuels by blending them into other diesel before export, maximising profits at the expense of Africans\u2019 health. Erik Solheim, the director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) called the practice unacceptable. </p> <p>Last week, the World Bank said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/08/air-pollution-costs-trillions-holds-back-poor-countries-world-bank\">air pollution was among the biggest killers worldwide</a>, costing developing countries billions of dollars in lost income.

The rapid growth of urban dwelling and car ownership in the developing world means that more Africans are exposed to high vehicle emissions.<br></p> <p>The high-sulphur fuels also have a knock-on effect, rapidly destroying emission-reducing technologies in vehicles, according to Rob de Jong, the head of the UNEP transport programme. \u201cSo if you buy a vehicle that\u2019s a couple of years old and import it into some of the African countries, the technology in there \u2013 sensors and filters \u2013 all gets spoilt, and these cars, which are potentially very clean, are destroyed in a couple of tanks, and for the next 20 years will be belching smoke,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the tragedy of this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This in turn increases emissions of fine particulate matter, which can lodge deep in the lungs, causing cancers and other health problems.</p> <p>Public Eye tested diesel sold at the pumps of outlets partly owned by various Swiss trading companies in eight countries across sub-Saharan Africa, and found that more than two thirds of the fuel they sampled had sulphur levels of more than 1,500ppm, 150 times the European limit. </p> <p>Data shared with the Guardian shows that ships chartered by BP imported cargoes tested at more than 3,600 ppm in 2013, when the legal sulphur limit was still 5,000 ppm.

  "<p>It\u2019s finally happened. After weeks of speculation, and despite a hastily called review by Theresa May, the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">given a green light</a> to the most expensive white elephant of a project in British history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/hinkley-point-squandermania-george-osborne-china\">With Hinkley Point, squandermania has reached dangerous new heights | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nuclear power station proposed at Hinkley Point is no ordinary piece of infrastructure. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/nuclear/new-petition-stop-hinkley-nuclear-plant-and-spend-money-renewable-instead-20160307\" title=\"\">according to Greenpeace</a> it will be the most costly object ever built on Earth. A large chunk of the funds for the construction will come from China as part of a deal that will see it lead on the development of another reactor in Bradwell, Essex.</p> <p>EDF, an energy company owned by the French state, will stump up the rest of the construction costs. Just months after people in this country voted to \u201ctake back control\u201d, ministers want to place a big chunk of our energy system in the hands of foreign governments.</p> <p>The amount of cash for this project that is set to be provided by UK taxpayers is eye-watering. The National Audit Office produced a detailed <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> in July on the viability of nuclear power in the UK, significantly revising its estimates of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report\" title=\"\">\u201ccontract for difference\u201d subsidies</a>, up from \u00a36.1bn to \u00a329.7bn. Essentially, UK bill payers and businesses are underwriting the whole project through a promise of unjustifiably high payments for every unit of electricity produced.</p> <p>This is a terrible deal that has been slammed by economists and environmentalists alike for locking us into paying twice the current wholesale electricity price for 35 years.</p> <p>Though the case against Hinkley can easily be made on financial grounds alone, it\u2019s not only wasted money that marks this project out as extremely risky. At the heart of the problems with nuclear energy is the stark fact that there is still no solution to the nuclear waste problem. Over its lifetime Hinkley will produce waste equivalent to 80% of all the waste so far produced in the UK in terms of radioactivity. Having such highly dangerous spent fuel on site for up to 200 years will be a massive challenge.</p> <p>Earlier this month a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37255980\" title=\"\">terrifying expos\u00e9 by the BBC</a> revealed the risks associated with handling nuclear waste, with allegations that years of neglect have led to the nuclear-processing facility at Sellafield being \u201criddled with safety flaws\u201d.</p> <p>Added to the waste issue are serious concerns about the viability of the reactor planned for Hinkley. It\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/what-do-we-know-about-hinkley-points-technology\" title=\"\">EPR</a>, and has not yet been shown to work anywhere in the world. Indeed every project in Europe and China using this kind of technology is facing huge cost overruns and delays. Vincent de Rivaz, EDF\u2019s chief executive, had promised that Hinkley would be cooking Christmas turkeys in 2017, when even under best-case scenarios the project will have barely even been started by then. In fact, Hinkley is unlikely to provide power until the late 2020s \u2013 far too late if we\u2019re serious about weaning ourselves off fossil fuels with the haste that\u2019s needed.</p> <p>Perhaps the most absurd aspect of this project is that fact that it\u2019s being waved through while cheaper and cleaner alternatives are being blocked. According to the National Grid\u2019s energy scenarios, by 2020 small-scale distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. But the government is now actively undermining progress. Beneath a layer of green spin, ministers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\" title=\"\">demolishing the UK\u2019s renewable-energy and energy-saving policies</a>. Last week it was revealed that only 10 new community energy organisations have been registered so far this year, compared with 76 last year.</p> <p>The evidence for alternatives is clear: smart meters, home and grid-scale batteries that store and release excess renewable power, and other modern solutions would be cheaper and more efficient than building new power stations to meet extra demand during relatively short periods. The cost of wind and solar has dropped significantly, and we know that a nationwide scheme of home insulation would hugely reduce demand, keep people warm in their homes and provide jobs in every constituency for a fraction of the price of Hinkley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/hinkley-point-c-no-more-than-doomed-attempt-face-saving\">Hinkley Point C is no more than a doomed attempt at face-saving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the evidence against Hinkley so overwhelming, it has been puzzling to see Labour swing behind the project.

Do we keep ploughing billions into mammoth infrastructure projects such as Hinkley, or do we refocus resources and build up an energy democracy from the bottom up?</p> <p>Make no mistake, nuclear power will suck resources away from building the energy infrastructure we need, and threaten our climate change targets because of the snail\u2019s pace at which it will be built.</p> <p>Politics is all about choices.

  "<h2><strong>What is it?</strong></h2> <p>Hinkley Point C will be the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in two decades, after finally getting the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">green light from Theresa May</a> on Thursday. The plant is expected to cost \u00a318bn to build, most of which will be financed by the French utility company EDF.</p> <p>Chinese investment, via the CGN group, will cover one-third of the \u00a318bn cost. The Hinkley deal also involves the Chinese taking a stake in a new project at Sizewell and an agreement to build their own power plant at Bradwell in Essex.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Hinkley Point C will be built next to the two existing facilities, A and B, and will be the biggest construction site in Europe.

The construction is expected to provide 25,000 jobs, while the finished power plant will employ 900 people.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>Why has construction been delayed?</strong></h2> <p>The government unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">postponed a final decision on the project in July</a>. The official reason given by Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, was that the government needed to \u201cconsider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.\u201d</p> <p>But it was thought that doubts about the reliability of the plant\u2019s future financing as well as fears about Chinese involvement in the future of UK energy made ministers put on the brakes. </p> <p>The delay goes back much further than July though. In 2007, Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF\u2019s UK arm, predicted Britons would be using electricity from Hinkley to cook their Christmas turkeys in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0b99b8964d6cfab4803d2b273480a770e854655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b99b8964d6cfab4803d2b273480a770e854655/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The current construction site at Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater, Somerset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The current construction site at Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater, Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Why is Hinkley Point C so controversial?</strong></h2> <p>Critics say that Hinkley C is too expensive, will take too long to build, is a bad deal for UK consumers, is potentially risky and leaves the UK too reliant on foreign powers for its energy. And some argue that UK energy policy should be focused on renewables, which are dropping in price. Let\u2019s break these issues down:</p> <p><strong>Chinese involvement<br></strong></p> <p>Many suspect that the prime minister is not comfortable about Chinese involvement in the scheme. The former business secretary Vince Cable said that when she was home secretary May had raised national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet.</p> <p>She was \u201cunhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that [then chancellor] George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time,\u201d Cable said.<br></p> <p>In October last year \u2013 on the eve of the Chinese president\u2019s state visit to the UK \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy wrote: \u201cSecurity experts \u2013 reportedly inside as well as outside government \u2013 are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain\u2019s energy production at will \u2026 MI5 believes that \u2018the intelligence services of \u2026 China \u2026 continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Financing<br></strong></p> <p>Critics argue that with the cost of borrowing so low following the vote for Brexit, the government should build its own new nuclear power stations.</p> <p>There are also doubts about the financial reliability of the French firm EDF, which is 80% owned by the French state. EDF\u2019s market value has halved in the last two years and is now valued at only \u20ac22bn (\u00a318.7bn), not significantly more than Hinkley C\u2019s entire investment. EDF also needs to invest \u20ac50bn over the next ten years to upgrade existing French reactors, and the French government wants to end some state guarantees for EDF\u2019s revenues.<br></p> <p>EDF\u2019s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\">resigned in March</a>, reportedly because he believed proceeding with the project could jeopardise the company.<br></p> <p><strong>Cost to consumers<br></strong></p> <p>Much has also been said about Hinkley C\u2019s \u201cnuclear strike price\u201d - the price the government has guaranteed EDF per unit of electricity produced.</p> <p>To secure French and Chinese investment, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-nuclear-power-enters-new-age-with-hinkley-deal-with-householders-footing-the-bill-8893023.html\">the last coalition government agreed</a> in 2013 to pay \u00a392.5 per megawatt hour (Mwh) of electricity \u2013 rising in line with inflation\u2013 for the first 35 years of the plant\u2019s life. Critics say this now looks like a bad deal following the collapse in the wholesale price of energy in the last three years. Currently, \u00a392.50 per Mwh is more than twice the cost of wholesale electricity.</p> <p>These guarantees could end up costing UK consumers up to \u00a330bn, <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf\">according to the National Audit Office</a> \u2013 five times the original 2013 estimate.<br></p> <p><strong>Technology</strong><br></p> <p>Questions have been raised about the technology that will be used.

In Olkiluoto in Finland, an EPR was <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/new-nuclear-finlands-cautionary-tale-for-the-uk\">due to come on stream in 2009</a> and is \u20ac2.6bn over budget.

Here, no one is spared the rising seas.</p> <p>\u201cI need a better wall, one with rocks,\u201d Heine mutters. Her presidency will probably be defined by climate change. Heine took charge in January and immediately declared a state of emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/obama-marshall-islands-drought\">over a drought so dire</a> that water was rationed in the capital, Majuro. The nation also faces the existential threat of sea level rise and, with it, the potential exodus of its population.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers are increasing, of people leaving,\u201d Heine says. \u201cWe see that almost every day. It concerns us. I think to a certain extent there are people who are thinking about the sea level rise and they\u2019re wanting to make sure they\u2019re on secure land.\u201d</p> <p>There is one destination at the top of the list for departing Marshallese: the USA. More than 20,000 people from this remote sprawl of islands, located between Hawaii and Australia, are now in the US. Surprisingly, the largest Marshallese community has gathered not in New York or Los Angeles, but around Springdale, an unremarkable corner of Arkansas. </p> <p>Better job prospects and a college education are major pulls, but climate change is now elbowing its way on to the list of considerations. A third of the Marshall Islands\u2019 60,000-strong population now resides in the US and some of those left behind fret that many more will follow, with the archipelago\u2019s unique culture blemished by each departure. The Marshallese government has openly worried \u201cabout massive outmigration in recent years\u201d \u2013 a fifth of the population <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/oia/reports/upload/RMI-2011-Census-Summary-Report-on-Population-and-Housing.pdf\">left between 1999 and 2011</a>.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/\">the seas rise</a>, the pathway to the US could be closing. A <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/173999.pdf\">compact of free association</a>, which allows Marshallese people to live and work in the US without a visa, ends in 2023 and there are no guarantees it will be extended.

The Marshallese may use faded US dollar bills, daub murals of LeBron James and Steph Curry on walls and retain the names Rita (after Rita Hayworth) and Laura (after Lauren Bacall) for the two ends of the curved Majuro island, but the relationship with America is a complicated one. </p> <p>A US military base remains at Kwajalein, where unarmed missiles periodically land, fired from California. Many Marshallese serve in the US army, while the rest of the population each gets around $500 a year via a trust fund set up to compensate the harrowing nuclear tests. Still, many feel it\u2019s not enough given the legacy of trauma. </p> <p>\u201cIt appalls me the way the US has treated the Marshallese people out here,\u201d says Jack Niedenthal, a native Pennsylvanian who came to the Marshall Islands with the Peace Corps in 1981 and never left. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a really dark spot, I think, in US history.

The country produces coconuts and breadfruit, and sells fishing licenses for the international trawlers that scour Marshallese waters for tuna, but it leans heavily upon the aid of others. Majuro\u2019s police station, courts and street lighting were funded by Japan and Taiwan, the latter country getting Marshallese recognition in the UN in return. </p> <p>Half of the Marshall Islands population is aged under 24 and many inevitably wonder how life would play out in the US, even if it is cloaked in the language of duty. Family bonds are sprawling yet iron-clad in Marshallese culture \u2013 moving countries is largely aimed at helping the family thrive financially or socially.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people feel like the United States is the promised land, and that\u2019s where a lot of them wind up going,\u201d says Niedenthal, the former Peace Corps member who has helped administer the trust fund for years but is now packing up his office, disillusioned. \u201cMost times they buy one-way tickets.

But the Marshallese community, now numbering around 10,000, remains close-knit. </p> <p>Legend has it they congregated at this unlikely, nondescript place because of a pioneer named John Moody, who moved to the area first through education and then work in the 1970s. </p> <p>Moody toiled for nearly 20 years in the <a href=\"http://www.tyson.com/\">Tysons</a> poultry plant, gutting and packing chickens.

Walmart\u2019s headquarters, located up the road in Bentonville, is another major feature of the local economy.</p> <p>The Marshallese are an object of curiosity here, but are largely accepted by a population that has has become more diverse in recent years.

Morris was plunged into a new reality, a world of McDonald\u2019s and Valentine\u2019s day and Hanukkah, without being able to speak English. But she is now what many people would expect of a stereotypical American teen.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first started here, I always wanted to tell myself \u2018I\u2019m American\u2019, because I thought it was really cool coming here and then seeing new faces,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I grew up, I knew more about my culture, and then I really liked it. I was telling myself: \u2018Wow, I\u2019m blessed to have this culture.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Morris now attempts to straddle both worlds, of Snapchat and of Marshallese customs on clothing and behavior, as well as celebrations such as <em>kemem</em>, a big bash thrown at the first birthday of a child. She says she was \u201cvery angry\u201d when she heard about what climate change was doing to the Marshall Islands and wants to go back to help \u2013 but not to live.</p> <p>Arlynda Jonas, 23, is also inclined to stay in the US. Like Morris she has an American accent, which she says some Marshallese people tease her about. </p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m more towards the American side than my Marshallese side but I know that I should be on my Marshallese side more strongly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard. I don\u2019t want to forget my culture, my heritage or anything.\u201d</p> <p>At the Constitution Day parade in Springdale, the tone is a little more defiant. The celebrations have been given a climate change theme, giving the occasion more of a protest than a party feel.

Candies are tossed to onlooking children as the parade passes by.</p> <p>Kenneth Kedi, speaker of the Marshallese parliament, is in Springdale to address the crowd. Kedi decries the salt-soaked soils of home, ruined for crops, and the disastrous drought. Climate change \u201cisn\u2019t shenanigans, it\u2019s reality\u201d, Kedi says.</p> <p>Kedi spent six years in the US and is now putting his son through school here. But he says he has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the diaspora, as he inspects a lei filled with candies that has been placed around his neck.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>They\u2019re losing their identity as Marshallese,\u201d he says of the Springdale community. \u201cThis is what we fear and our chiefs fear will happen, and it\u2019s happening.\u201d He moved back to the Marshall Islands because he loves his country, he says, but \u201cnow, that train is reversing\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d251a2f9ddcae9502082953cac1f831c3e5a4734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d251a2f9ddcae9502082953cac1f831c3e5a4734/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marshallese men and women celebrate Constitution Day in Springdale, Arkansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marshallese men and women celebrate Constitution Day in Springdale, Arkansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mae Ryan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kedi, a soft-spoken man, worries that more people will flee as climate change starts to bite deeper into the fabric of Marshallese life. That they will probably move to the US is \u201cbittersweet\u201d, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we have been given a bad deal,\u201d he says. \u201cWe make a minuscule contribution to the climate greenhouse effect but we are at the very frontline of the problems of climate change.\u201d He adds that plutonium stored at Enewetak, one of the Marshallese islands, is starting to leak into the ocean \u2013 yet another American legacy.</p> <p>\u201cSo, yeah, we\u2019re getting a bad deal,\u201d he says. \u201cWe certainly are getting a bad deal.\u201d</p> <p>Before the beauty pageant begins there is a lengthy church service. Marshallese people are often deeply religious \u2013 most of the population is Protestant. Large sections of the address is in Marshallese but at one point the pastor blurts out in English while referencing climate change: \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p> <p>Pageant contenders read out poems on climate change. One has the anguished line: \u201cWe are losing our island, where will we stand?\u201d Another offers: \u201cKeep your faith in God.\u201d There follows dancing, singing and intricate, beautiful Marshallese gowns. Eventually, as we near 1am and even Marshallese patience is wearing thin, Arlynda Jonas is crowned the winner.</p> <p>It\u2019s a Marshallese triumph rooted in America. Jonas would be sad if the Marshall Islands were eaten away by the waves but can see an obvious solution for the country\u2019s people. \u201cIt would be great if they did all move [to the US] because there are just so many opportunities for them here, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cI think it would be great for them to move here.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Majuro, there are people who have to weigh whether to stay or go every day. For those who don\u2019t have the means or desire to relocate to the US, the future is particularly precarious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"973dd14993f2bdb8d9c1448bee50eca8bd1acda6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973dd14993f2bdb8d9c1448bee50eca8bd1acda6/0_0_5289_3526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child plays with trash in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, where 20,000 people live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child plays with trash in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, where 20,000 people live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mae Ryan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marlyna Laibwij, a teaching assistant in the community of Laura, has seen her neighbours abandon their coastal homes and move inland.

Earlier this year, after the waters yet again lapped at the walls of her family home, she pleaded with the local mayor for help. He organized the construction of a sea wall, essentially rocks bundled in bags. It has provided some temporary relief. </p> <p>\u201cI would have abandoned my house but I would have missed it very much,\u201d Laibwij says. \u201cI loved my home and I didn\u2019t want to abandon it.</p> <p>\u201cLife is getting hard, and I believe that all of these [changes] come from the same thing, from climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Should the waves advance further, however, Laibwij isn\u2019t sure if her family could remain. As we leave her house, in a moment of tender devastation, she confides: \u201cI think we can be here for another year or two. That\u2019s what I think. What do you think?

  "<p>A former news anchor has struck a rare blow for Japanese women in public life by becoming the first female leader of the country\u2019s biggest opposition party.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Renho Murata easily defeated her two rivals for the leadership of the left-of-centre Democratic party on Thursday, hours after she sparked a minor controversy by revealing she still held dual Japanese and Taiwanese nationality despite insisting earlier that she had renounced the latter while in her teens.</p> <p>The 48-year-old, who was born in Japan to a Taiwanese father and Japanese mother, is expected to give her party a temporary boost, following a run of poor election results.</p> <p>Murata \u2013 known simply as Renho \u2013 said the party\u2019s priority was to re-establish itself as a serious alternative to the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which together with its junior coalition partner dominates both houses of parliament.</p> <p>\u201cFrom here on, we face a giant ruling party,\u201d she said after the vote. \u201cI\u2019d like to call on everyone to join me in creating a party that does not criticise but makes proposals ... so that one day we will become Japan\u2019s choice.\u201d</p> <p>Murata is the third woman to attain high political office in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> in the past two months, although women are still woefully under-represented in the country\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>In July, Yuriko Koike was elected governor of Tokyo, and immediately confronted the city\u2019s bureaucracy by <a href=\"http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160831/p2g/00m/0dm/074000c\">postponing the relocation of Tsukiji market</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest fish market \u2013 due to concerns over soil contamination at the new site.</p> <p>Last month, Tomomi Inada, a rightwinger who has been tipped as a future prime minister, became Japan\u2019s second defence minister.</p> <p>Their appointments were made against a background of gender imbalance. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women make up less than 10% of MPs in the lower house of Japan\u2019s parliament, and 20% of those in the upper house. Inada is one of only three women in the 20-strong cabinet of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose mission to fill 30% of public and private sector leadership positions with women by 2020 has got off to a disappointing start.</p> <p>Murata, a former swimsuit model who worked as a journalist before being elected to parliament in 2004, seized the opportunity to lead the Democrats after the former leader, Katsuya Okada, said he was stepping down in the wake of the party\u2019s poor performance in July\u2019s upper house elections.</p> <p>During its three years in government from 2009, the party was criticised for mishandling the planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/japan-prime-minister-yukio-hatoyama-resigns\">relocation of a US marine base</a> on the southern island of Okinawa and for its response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi</a> nuclear power plant in March 2011. The party, whose MPs include an uneasy mix of liberal and conservative defectors from other parties, has never recovered from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-conservatives-poll-triumph\">heavy general election defeat</a> in late 2012.</p> <p>A poll by the Asahi Shimbun this week showed support for the LDP at 40%, with the Democrats on just 7%.</p> <p>Murata\u2019s attempts to rebuild the party\u2019s credibility got off to a shaky start, just hours before her expected victory was confirmed on Thursday.</p> <p>Questioned by reporters, she acknowledged that she still held Taiwanese nationality, despite earlier claiming that she had become a naturalised citizen of Japan in 1985 at the age of 17.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to apologise for the confusion caused by my inaccurate recollection of what happened and the contradictions in my recent remarks,\u201d she said, before confirming that she identified herself as Japanese. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked for the good of this, my own country, and I\u2019ll continue to do so,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Japanese law requires people with dual nationality to choose one or the other before they reach the age of 22, although failure to do so is not a crime. Many retain dual nationality under a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy.</p> <p>The nationality debacle is likely to be seized on by her opponents, however. The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper described Murata\u2019s confusion over her nationality as a \u201csorry state of affairs\u201d.</p> <p>Despite her assurances this week that she had taken steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship, the newspaper said in an editorial: \u201cIt is out of the question for a legislator \u2013 who is supposed to serve the interests of the nation, including in foreign affairs and national security \u2013 to leave their own nationality obscure.\u201d</p> <p>The Yomiuri suggested that some might question her loyalty to Japan, particularly over foreign policy issues where it is in disagreement with Taiwan.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Taiwan is friendly towards Japan, it is in conflict with the Japanese standpoint regarding some issues, for instance, its ownership claims on the Senkaku islands,\u201d the paper said. \u201cIf Renho retains her Taiwan citizenship, she could become the target of undesirable suspicions regarding her relations with Taiwan.\u201d </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/senkaku-islands\">Senkakus</a> are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan.</p> <p>During her leadership campaign, Murata vowed to protect the war-renouncing article of Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, as speculation mounts that Abe will use his party\u2019s big parliamentary majority to trigger changes that would end the military\u2019s strictly defensive role.<br></p>",
  "<p>It was \u201cthe can-do crowd\u201d, according to the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens. Those who gathered at the <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/expo/\">Health and Care Innovation Expo 2016</a> in Manchester were certainly hungry for the latest cutting-edge practice and the hottest technology on show.<br></p> <p>But Brexit uncertainty, funding anxieties and the unresolved junior doctors\u2019 dispute added a sharp edge to debate on how the health and care system can be transformed into one fit for 21st century purpose. And scarcely a session passed without warnings from patients\u2019 and service-users\u2019 representatives that people were feeling left out of the loop on plans for change.<br></p> <p>Paul Baumann, NHS England\u2019s chief financial officer and, as he said, \u201cchief devolutionist\u201d responsible for regional autonomy on health and care spending, set the tone for the reformers when he warned that the latest drugs and technologies would be unaffordable for the NHS unless it did \u201ceverything else differently\u201d. This would require \u201cbold innovation and bold leadership\u201d.<br></p> <p>But David Cartwright, a patients\u2019 representative from Oldham, summed up the frustration of the opposing camp when he asked Baumann and leaders of the Greater Manchester devolution project: \u201cWhen are you going to tell our communities what we are going to get and what we are not going to get?\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Public consultation on STPs assured</strong></h2> <p>Stevens picked up on the mood and used his keynote speech to try to offer reassurance, particularly with respect to the 44 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/stps-local-modernisation-plans-nhs-four-years\">sustainability and transformation plans</a> (STPs) being developed by local care leaders to transform systems across the whole of England.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/09/lethal-combination-secrecy-jargon-overshadowed-nhs-plans\">A lethal combination of secrecy and jargon has overshadowed NHS plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said he would be issuing a notice stressing the need for formal public consultation on the changes proposed by the STPs, which may include closure of hospital services. But he added: \u201cI hope that people will give NHS and local government leaders the respect that what they are trying to do is incredibly difficult, but incredibly important.\u201d<br></p> <p>Matthew Swindells, NHS England\u2019s national director for commissioning, said the aim was to get all plans for STPs \u201cassured\u201d by the end of December so that they could be aligned with operational plans effective from April 2017. Challenged on the tightness of the timescale, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to take longer. Every day we decide to have another committee meeting rather than getting on with making hard decisions, we are not making optimal use of health and social care from the money available.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Technology is the key</strong></h2> <p>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced plans to create an \u201civy league\u201d of global exemplar hospitals to fast-track digital excellence.</p> <p>Naming the initial 12 trusts each to receive up to \u00a310m in funding, Hunt said the idea would be to \u201cbuddy up\u201d each one with a leading US hospital such as the Cleveland or Mayo clinics to bring them up to the standard of the best in the world. Less tech-ready trusts would be prepared in subsequent waves. Hunt also promised \u201cinstant access\u201d to personal online health records. He said: \u201cThis puts power back into the hands of the patients.\u201d<br></p> <p>These announcements came on the back of publication at Expo of the final report of the Wachter review of NHS digital readiness, highlighting the need for clinical input in achieving digital transformation.<br></p> <p>The review\u2019s author and professor at the University of California, Dr Robert Wachter, stressed the need to \u201creimagine tasks\u201d rather then superimpose technology on old working methods. He said: \u201cThat is why we need to involve young people in this process. They need to look at workstreams and question why we do it that way, with fresh eyes.\u201d<br></p> <p>The digital revolution is, however, raising concerns about appropriate use of personal information. Dame Fiona Caldicott, the national data guardian, speaking about her review of public trust in the use of health and social care data, warned: \u201cPeople no longer accept things being done to them without their knowledge.\u201d Her review sets out 10 standards for data use, informing individuals and conditions for opting out. <br></p> <h2><strong>Innovation needs to be implemented faster</strong></h2> <p>There is no shortage of medical and health innovations to transform what NHS England\u2019s medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, described as the \u201cbiggest semi-integrated health system in the world\u201d. But he pointed out that \u201cideas are only as good as their uptake\u201d.<br></p> <p>Discussing the challenge of achieving innovation at scale, Keogh outlined the NHS innovation accelerator programme (NIA) \u2013 the brain child of a junior doctor, Dr Mahiben Maruthappu. In its first year, the NIA funded 17 fellows whose ideas and processes were accessed by 3 million patients in six months, Maruthappu said, with a further cohort of fellows due to be announced in October, focusing on disease prevention, early identification and long-term conditions.<br></p> <h2><strong>Devolution</strong></h2> <p>Devolution plans are now being developed in areas covering some 55% of England, following Greater Manchester\u2019s lead in setting up the NHS\u2019s first devolved health and social care partnership, which came into being in April.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/aug/31/how-manchester-plans-best-place-people-dementia\">How Manchester plans to be the best place for people with dementia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jon Rouse, chief officer of the partnership, making his first speech after just 20 days in post, said no one should be under the illusion that devolution was \u201cmagic dust\u201d. Although there was already satisfaction in the development of dementia-friendly pharmacies and Pride in Practice, a new standard of excellence in healthcare for gay, lesbian and bisexual patients, the biggest achievement so far was the bringing together of a strategic partnership of 37 NHS, local government and social organisations.<br></p> <p>Rouse said: \u201cJudge us later down the line by how we make progress on patient experience and clinical experience. Devolution is complex, it\u2019s dynamic and difficult, but it\u2019s worthwhile.\u201d<br></p> <h2>People come first</h2> <p>Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for NHS England, issued a call to arms to recognise and promote the diversity of the workforce. It was, she said, \u201cfrankly appalling\u201d that there were so few black and minority ethnic directors of nursing. Making special mention of health workers from the rest of Europe, worried by Brexit, Cummings said: \u201cDiversity makes us a better service.\u201d <br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>Global investment in energy fell by 8% last year to $1.8tn (\u00a31.4), reflecting low oil and gas prices and cost falls in the sector, <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/bookshop/731-World_Energy_Investment_2016\">new data shows</a>.<br></p> <p>Nearly half of the decline was accounted for by the US, where plunging oil prices and a recent boom in shale gas, along with cost deflation in the energy sector, have played an increasing role.</p> <p>China remained the world\u2019s biggest investor in energy worldwide, with $315bn spent in 2015, despite a slowing in the pace of its headlong economic growth.</p> <p>Despite falls overall, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/renewable-energy-smashes-global-records-in-2015-report-shows\">investment in renewable energy in 2015 remained robust</a>, according to the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog, which amassed the data. The move towards clean energy was driven by government policies, with countries pursuing low-carbon growth.</p> <p>About $313bn was invested in renewable and other low-carbon forms of energy last year, representing about a fifth of total energy spending. Much of it was in electricity generation, in which renewable power takes the lion\u2019s share of available investment funds. This has been further aided by steep falls in the cost of wind turbines and solar panels.</p> <p>By contrast, investment around the world in gas-fired power generation, touted as a transition technology between coal-fired power generation and renewables, fell by close to 40%.</p> <p>The investment figures show the mood before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">landmark agreement on climate change reached in Paris last December</a>. Under that accord, nearly 200 countries agreed to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>This will entail curbs to greenhouse gas emissions from all the world\u2019s major economies, developed and developing, and meeting these targets will require new policies to favour low-carbon energy above fossil fuels. Such actions should mean further boosts to clean energy sources in years to come.</p> <p>The IEA, in the report World Energy Investment 2016, found that the world\u2019s energy systems were undergoing \u201ca broad reorientation\u201d promoting low-carbon energy sources and greater energy efficiency. But the organisation said that investment in these must be ramped up much further if the aims embraced in Paris were to be achieved.</p> <p>Fatih Birol, executive director of the agency, said: \u201cWe see a broad shift of spending towards cleaner energy. Government measures can work and are key to a successful energy transition. But while progress has been achieved, investors need clarity and certainty from policymakers. Governments must not only maintain, but heighten, their commitment to achieve energy security and climate goals.\u201d</p> <p>However, his emphasis on renewable forms of power generation was disputed by Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association. He said that the continuing use of coal, especially in Asia where most new coal-fired power stations are being built, showed the need for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/uk-must-move-now-on-carbon-capture-to-save-consumers-billions-says-report\">massive new investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities</a>, which barely figure in today\u2019s investments.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIn many countries, coal is the logical low-cost power choice, particularly in Asia. To assume that fossil fuels will not be required or can be substituted in the next few decades is likely to lead to cheaper, less efficient coal technology being deployed, threatening the ability to deliver global climate objectives. It is critical that energy investment is directed towards all forms of low-carbon technology. Policy parity for CCS is essential if we are to achieve the best outcomes possible.\u201d</p>",

Everyone knows Brad suffers from asthma, his medical treatment is British Cycling and International Cycling Union approved and like all Team GB athletes he follows Wada regulations to the letter. The leak of these records is an attempt to undermine the credibility of Wada and that\u2019s something for them to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the two leading cyclists, golfer Charley Hull, rower Sam Townsend and rugby union player Heather Fisher are included in the second batch of athletes whose details have been made public by cyber-espionage group Fancy Bears, which is believed to be from Russia. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by any of the athletes.</p> <p>In a separate development, UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) has written to Team GB athletes warning them that their medical records could be at risk of exposure.</p> <p>The letter states: \u201cUkad is in close contact with Wada and it has been confirmed to us that the group has accessed some athlete data. As a result, and as a member of Team GB, we are writing to let you know that your information may potentially be at risk.</p> <p>\u201cPlease be assured that we are treating this matter with the utmost concern and seriousness. We are working hard to urgently determine what impact, if any, this may have on you and other British athletes, and exactly what information, if any, may have been compromised.\u201d</p> <p>Ukad also urge athletes to be vigilant where use of computer passwords is concerned. \u201cRemember, no sporting or anti-doping organisation, including Wada, will ever ask you for your password, and you should not divulge this to anyone under any circumstance. If you are concerned about the security of your password, we strongly recommend that you take steps to change it.\u201d</p> <p>Wada <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/wada-russian-cyber-attack-espionage-group\">first fell victim to hackers on Tuesday</a> when medical records relating to TUEs granted to certain athletes were leaked. TUEs can be issued to athletes who have an illness or condition which requires the use of medication that is on WADA\u2019s prohibited list.</p> <p>The latest leaks suggest that Rio gold medallist Wiggins, who has never made any secret of the fact he suffers from asthma, has several TUEs for salbutamol, a substance commonly used in an inhaler.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the three-times Tour de France winner Froome has TUEs for prednisolone, a steroid that can be used to treat chest complaints. In a statement on Thursday, Team Sky, for whom Froome rides, said: \u201cApplications made by Team Sky for TUEs have all been managed and recorded in line with the processes put in place by the governing bodies.

  "<p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Hope Solo are \u2013 how shall we say this politely? \u2013 divisive characters in world football. Both attracted ire this summer when they attacked their opponents for a lack of adventure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-olympics-football-rio-2016\">Solo called Sweden \u201ca bunch of cowards\u201d</a> after they ground their way to a penalty shoot-out victory against the defending champions, USA, at the women\u2019s Olympic football tournament. And at Euro 2016, Ronaldo launched the biggest attack on Iceland <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">since the Cod Wars</a> when he disparaged the tactics of everyone\u2019s favorite plucky underdogs. \u201cWhen [Iceland] don\u2019t try to play and just defend, defend, defend, this in my opinion shows a small mentality and they are not going to do anything in the competition,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/14/portugal-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\">fumed Ronaldo after Portugal drew with Iceland</a>. Ronaldo was proved right too, as long as you don\u2019t include beating England in the last 16 as \u201canything\u201d. Which many people wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>But cheap gags at Roy Hodgson aside, did Ronaldo and Solo - which sounds a bit like an 80s cover band \u2013 have a point? Are today\u2019s football games too easily destroyed by parking the bus and counter-attacking? The answer is simple: yes. The solution, though, is more difficult.</p> <p>And make no mistake: For all the global dollars, euros and pounds that wind up in the hands of Manchester United and Barcelona, a solution is necessary. The internet and the 500-channel universe have given football a larger audience, particularly in the United States where the Premier League now regularly <a href=\"http://www.socceramerica.com/article/68858/tv-report-epl-outdraws-nhl-in-2015-16.html\">draws in bigger viewership that the NHL</a>. But that audience can also be taken away.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">Gimmicky attempts to jazz up the game</a>, done mostly for an American audience with Fifa\u2019s alternating blessing and scorn, didn\u2019t pay off. The old NASL had a points system that rivaled English county cricket in its complexity and enforced the offside law only in the last 35 yards of the field. The USISL of the early 1990s used a 60-minute countdown clock that stopped when the ball went out of play, along with \u201ckick-ins,\u201d cruel and unusual punishment for fouling too often, and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/fifa-plan-bigger-goals-1322249.html\">the occasional flirtation with larger goals</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">Three points for a goal? League 1 America: the soccer revolution that never was</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A proposed new league in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">that would have limited players to particular zones</a> and given bonus points for long-range goals was dismissed in favor of the less experimental Major League Soccer. When commissioner Don Garber took over MLS in 1999 and immediately killed <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/throwback-thursday-hockey-style-shootouts-in-mls.html\">the post-game shootout</a>, a 35-yard one-on-one vestige of the NASL, the United States ended its service as a laboratory for attack-boosting rules.</p> <p>But the changes made globally to discourage negativity haven\u2019t solved the problem, either. No one wants to go back to the days of awarding only two points for a win or allowing defenders to play the ball into their own goalkeepers\u2019 safe hands. Yet those tweaks are not enough, especially in an era in which we\u2019ve all realized that to play like Barcelona, you need to be a team like Barcelona.</p> <p>The fundamental problem is space. Twenty-two players on a large rectangle seems to be a good number until the space is condensed by a team playing a high defensive line. Or when a crowd of players are in the box, reducing football to a simple test of one\u2019s ability to leap while shoving just enough to avoid a whistle.</p> <p>With all due respect to the recent set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/08/kickoffs-backwards-rule-changes\">changes to the laws of the game</a>, highlighted by the newfound legality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/08/kickoffs-backwards-rule-changes\">taking a kick-off backwards</a>, it\u2019s time for something more radical.</p> <p>Such as \u2026</p> <p><strong>Smaller numbers on set pieces</strong>. One reason teams can park the bus is that traffic in front of goal is so congested on corner kick and free kicks in an opponent\u2019s half. If teams were limited \u2013 say, five to six players per team in the box until the ball is cleared \u2013 attacking players would have more space, and defensive players would have more of a challenge. Teams could nominate whoever they want to go into the box so fans would still get the thrill of seeing their keeper sprint up the pitch for a rubbish header in the final seconds of a cup tie.</p> <p><strong>Farewell, offside.</strong> Interpretation of Law 11 <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9930438/the-offside-rule-change-explained-with-the-help-of-a-referee\">has evolved over the years</a>. Now, we\u2019re told \u201ceven is on.\u201d But it\u2019s still far too easy for a defensive line to compress the field. The law\u2019s supporters say defenders are free to join the attack without having to worry about an opposing forward lurking 70 yards down the field, but when the defense press forward, we can end up with 20 or so mobile players in a congested area. And then the outcome of a game may hinge on the split-second decision of an assistant referee who surely could do better things than stare at the second-to-last defender for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Which leads to this \u2026</p> <p><strong>More eyes off the ball</strong>. The NFL <a href=\"http://operations.nfl.com/the-officials/these-officials-are-really-good/officials-responsibilities-positions/\">has several officials</a> who watch for fouls away from the ball. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(basketball)\">Basketball has three officials</a> for 10 players. Ice hockey <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)\">has four officials for 12 players</a>. Football has one person <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/04/world.cup.referees.fitness/\">running more than 12 miles per game</a> just to be near the ball. Two more officials race along the lines of the field, but again, their primary task is to stare at the second-to-last defender. Then a fourth official holds aloft a sign and attempts to calm down Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (more than four officials <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22440422\">have been used in some tournaments</a> but the practice is not yet widespread).</p> <p>Surely some responsibilities can be rearranged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/15/mls-video-replay-referees-football\">Tests with a \u201cvideo assistant referee\u201d are promising</a>, though perhaps a video official can chat with the referee through a headset (as in cricket, rugby, field hockey and a handful of other sports) instead of waiting for the referee to jog over to see someone\u2019s video screen.</p> <p>But if we need to resort to stronger measures, maybe we need to start punishing teams who sit back, make themselves a nice sandwich and wait for penalties. Some suggestions:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/05/breaking-the-law-why-fifa-should-relax-its-eligibility-rules\">Breaking the Law: why Fifa should relax its eligibility rules | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Passivity penalty</strong>. Each team will be required to register a legitimate shot on goal at least once every 30 minutes. Failure to do so is punished by the removal of one player. The referee wouldn\u2019t issue a red card \u2013 so players aren\u2019t suspended for a collective failing \u2013 but the manager of the offending (or over-defending) team would be obliged to take off one player. We\u2019ll need to define a shot too \u2013 possibly a ball that is either on target or within six yards either side of the goal \u2013 to prevent players from just taking a speculative whiff from 50 yards out every few minutes.</p> <p>Those are game-by-game solutions. A few other ideas are dependent on the type of competition.</p> <p><strong>League play:</strong> Deduct points. Each time a team attempts fewer than eight shots in a game, it\u2019s a warning. The third warning is a one-point deduction. The fifth warning is a two-point deduction. And so on. Until your team is relegated on minus-98 points.</p> <p><strong>Tournament play:</strong> Revamp extra time. If a game remains tied after extra time, the team that attempts the most shots in the added period is declared the winner. A team may still park the bus for 90 minutes, but sometime in the next 30, they needs to get that bus in gear. If teams are level on shots, it goes to penalties just to make England unhappy. Yes, you may see teams doing whatever they can to take or prevent shots. That simply adds another dimension to the game and makes the tiebreaker something other than the test of nerves and luck of the traditional kicks from the penalty spot.</p> <p>And if all else fails, boo. Complain. Gripe. Writers, should stop hailing the \u201cbrave defense\u201d of an overmatched team that makes little effort to play an entertaining game. Fans, create tifo ridiculing negative opponents.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019ll remind coaches and players that their massive salaries are dependent on people who have other options to spend their money on. And if they keep on treating the beautiful game as a dour exercise in cranking out results, we\u2019ll all be watching and playing lacrosse or ultimate frisbee in another couple of decades.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister, Theresa May, tops the list of 50 most powerful people in UK higher education this year. </p> <p>Published by <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/\">Wonkhe</a> \u2013 a thinktank for higher education policy \u201cwonks\u201d \u2013 the list is dominated by politicians, but includes the vice-chancellors, journalists and thinkers who are making the most impact on the sector.</p> <p>Wonkhe editor Mark Leach says: \u201cThere is, of course, no scientific way to measure power. Our judging discussions had two overriding themes: who has the power to allocate resources and make the rules? And who is active and effective at trying to influence this? </p> <p>\u201cMany of the figures work day-in, day-out in our sector. Others may give very little thought to the world of UK universities \u2013 but they make the massive decisions that shape the world in which British higher education must operate.\u201d</p> <h2>Top 10 on the power list</h2> <p>(with commentary from Wonkhe)</p> <h2>1 Theresa May, prime minister</h2> <p>As home secretary, May was loathed by universities thanks to her dogged determination to restrict international student recruitment and her zealous implementation of anti-terror legislation. May has previously declared her pride in standing up to university lobbyists on these matters, and said she believes universities need to reform their business models to lessen their dependence on foreign recruitment. Fresh policy being driven from No.10 could have far-reaching consequences for the sector, such as a new wave of grammar schools, and compelling universities to open their own schools. The new PM will define the post-Brexit climate in which higher education institutions will have to learn to operate. </p> <h2><strong>2 Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor </strong></h2> <p>As one of the most influential people on the planet, Angela Merkel scores very highly on this year\u2019s list. The terms of the UK\u2019s exit will have to be approved by the European Union\u2019s member states, but nothing will be agreed without the consent of Germany. We should expect her to play a key role in the negotiating lines for the UK\u2019s exit of the EU, and subsequent deal-making. Bundestag elections will next take place in 2017 and Merkel is said to be politically vulnerable. So this could be a make-or-break year for the quantum-chemist-turned-politician. </p> <h2><strong>3 David Davis and Oliver Robbins, secretary of state and permanent secretary for exiting the European Union</strong></h2> <p>The men running the first ever UK government department to include a present continuous verb literally hold the keys to the kingdom in their hands. It\u2019s a vastly complicated task, and the highly-regarded Oliver Robbins will play a critical role at every twist and turn. The sector has already been in to see the pair and state their case. David Davis has never showed a great deal of interest in universities, and hasn\u2019t given much away yet. But it is in his power to put universities at the centre of a sustainable deal \u2013 or to set up a post-Brexit horror show. </p> <h2><strong>4 Carlos Moedas, EU commissioner for research, innovation and science </strong></h2> <p> Moedas will have considerable influence over the finer points of higher education policy during Brexit, and the sector will need to make representations to him to get a good post-Brexit deal with the European research community. Moedas has already been in close communication with Jo Johnson about the status of Horizon 2020 projects involving British researchers, and although he\u2019s offered some reassurance, little action has been taken so far. </p> <h2><strong>5 Philip Hammond, chancellor of the exchequer </strong></h2> <p>A sober public image has led to the chancellor being labelled \u201can accountant\u201d, but his background is actually in entrepreneurial business, and Hammond was not shy about taking risks. A post-Brexit reset of UK fiscal policy will have a massive impact on higher education. Hammond has hinted that austerity and his predecessor\u2019s fiscal targets may be tweaked or abandoned, and his upcoming autumn statement is hotly anticipated. Hammond is thought to be arguing for a Brexit settlement that maintains as much of the single market as is possible, which should make him an ally for the sector\u2019s broader interests.</p> <h2><strong>6 Xi Jinping, president of China </strong></h2> <p>The growing importance of China to UK higher education (and indeed the wider economy) will be accelerated by Brexit, particularly if there is a decline in EU student numbers. Several UK universities now have campuses in China, including Liverpool and Nottingham. In 2008-09, one in five new international students came from China. In 2012-13, it was one in three. Around a quarter of postgraduate taught students are Chinese. The growing success of China\u2019s own universities in global rankings is also a significant competition area for UK universities. Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to the UK last year saw the red carpet enthusiastically rolled out by UK universities who were desperate to impress the Chinese premier. Amid the pomp and ceremony, it was excruciatingly clear that the Chinese felt that they represented the stronger side of a global partnership.</p> <h2><strong>7 Jo Johnson, minister for universities, science, research and innovation </strong></h2> <p>On his appointment, the sector was pleased that a well-connected and wonkish politician was chosen to represent it. Few anticipated the zeal with which he would take forward a series of reforms that are still only in their early stages, including the paradigm-shifting Teaching Excellence Framework which has been dominating the policy debate. Since the reshuffle, he has to divide his time between two departments and teams, and has been stripped of his own special adviser. He will be judged on his ability to resist Theresa May and Amber Rudd\u2019s mindless assault on universities\u2019 ability to recruit international students and to ensure the best possible deal for universities and science in the Brexit negotiations. <strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>8 Justine Greening, secretary of state for education </strong></h2> <p>The first openly LGBT woman to serve in the cabinet, and the first education secretary to attend a comprehensive school, Greening was welcomed as a safe pair of hands after Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan. The return of higher and further education to the Department for Education puts her in a powerful position. She will be the arbiter in fights for funding between schools, universities and colleges, particularly if the Treasury begins trimming the department\u2019s budget. Greening is a close ally of the prime minister and is tasked with planning the reintroduction of grammar schools.<strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>9 John Kingman, chair, UK Research and Innovation </strong></h2> <p>Recently appointed as the inaugural chair, John Kingman\u2019s already-high stock in the sector is rising further. When UKRI is fully operational, it will have a budget of over \u00a36bn per year. He\u2019ll be combining his UKRI role with that of chairman of Legal &amp; General Group. <strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>10 Greg Clark, secretary of state for business, energy, and industrial strategy</strong></h2> <p>Clark finds himself higher up this year\u2019s list thanks to his wide-ranging new role. It\u2019s not only the research and science policy buck that stops at his desk \u2013 his mandate to create a new industrial strategy for the UK could have far-reaching consequences for universities. Many in the sector are pinning their hopes on the strategy mitigating some of the worst effects of Brexit, so the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. </p> <h2>The top VCs</h2> <p>University leaders also feature prominently on the power list, particularly vice-chancellors who take the most active roles outside of their own institutions. </p> <p>Leach comments: \u201cSome, such as Leszek Borysiewicz, Steve Smith and David Eastwood, are veteran \u2018big beasts\u2019 of the sector who have had multiple leadership roles in the world of education, science and research. Others, such as Ian Diamond and Anton Muscatelli, have taken an active role in a specific area of government policy. Finally, there are the \u2018rising stars\u2019, a new generation of vice chancellors who recognise the importance of being active in public life, such as Janet Beer.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Here are the top 10 VCs and their rankings:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f946bd1486f78f200c31e657cc723d0fb410ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f946bd1486f78f200c31e657cc723d0fb410ca0/734_560_3798_2279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, vice chancellor of Cambridge University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leszek Borysiewicz, University of Cambridge (15)<br>Ian Diamond, University of Aberdeen (20)<br>Anton Muscatelli, University of Glasgow (21)<br>Louise Richardson, University of Oxford (22)<br>David Eastwood, University of Birmingham (25)<br>Steve Smith, University of Exeter (26)<br>David Bell, University of Reading (29)<br>Janet Beer, University of Liverpool (31)<br>Anthony Seldon, University of Buckingham (35)<br>Julia Goodfellow, University of Kent (37)</p> <p><em>The full list of 50 is available <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/\">on the Wonkhe site </a></em></p>",

Since 2013, New Zealand has put a standing offer to Australia that it would take 150 people a year, but the Turnbull government has consistently shut the offer down, arguing it would give a green light to people smugglers.</p> <p>After Dutton\u2019s comments to al-Jazeera were published in Australia, the New Zealand immigration minister issued a two-line statement saying New Zealand was not contemplating any separate discussion with Nauru over the resettlement offer.</p> <p>In questions after his speech on Thursday night, Dutton said there was absolutely no change in the government\u2019s position on resettlement in New Zealand.</p> <p>He said the question put to him on al-Jazeera referenced a deal that could be struck between Nauru and New Zealand, not an Australia-led negotiation. \u201cThere has been no change. Our position remains unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>Dutton told the Australian Strategic Policy Institute the government had to hold the line on deterrence measures because people smugglers \u201cwill not go quietly into the night; they are ruthless and sophisticated criminals\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey diligently follow the asylum seeker debate in this country, looking intently for any opportunity to restart what was a half-billion-dollar industry. Whatever decisions we make, we must always cast an eye to potential pull factors and the consequences that may follow.\u201d</p> <p>Dutton acknowledged there had been what he termed \u201cissues in our strained detention and processing networks\u201d \u2013 but he repeated his regular criticism of refugee advocates.</p> <p>\u201cOur detractors do no service to anyone by trading in false hope and speaking in disingenuous terms. Their entreaties to a different approach offer nothing but a holiday from history and ignore the fundamental reality that secure borders require policies that are tough and fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf they are not tough they will not be fair to those desperate people waiting in camps. And they will not be morally fair to those who will again be lured to the murky depths by the siren call of people smugglers.\u201d</p> <p>He also told his audience terrorist groups such as Daesh were \u201cexploiting the mass movements of the international migrant crisis to move materials and personnel to support terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are using chaos and volume as cover. Just two days ago three Syrian nationals who travelled through Turkey and Greece using fake passports were arrested in a series of pre-dawn terror raids in northern Germany,\u201d Dutton said.</p> <p>\u201cThe men were allegedly assisted by the same smuggler organisation behind the Paris attacks.\u201d</p> <p>During the period of questions Dutton was asked why John Howard could soften the \u201cPacific Solution\u201d and bring people held offshore back to Australia in the mid 2000s \u2013 but the Turnbull government was resisting current entreaties to bring people out of what is proving to be indefinite detention.</p> <p>The immigration minister suggested criminal syndicates lacked the capacity during the Howard years to communicate quickly with one another about political statements being made in Australia. \u201cWe have to learn the lessons of history but we have to have a contemporary view,\u201d Dutton said.</p> <p>The minister said the government was working \u201cvery very intensely with a number of partners\u201d on third country resettlement \u2013 but complex resolutions to complex problems can\u2019t be announced overnight.</p>",

It drops the $500,000 lifetime cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer did a lot of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print first. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the parliament and that needs Labor\u2019s support. But the win did increase Coalition confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne followed up, saying the Labor\u2019s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. Remember that one under Tony Abbott?<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very interesting fishing exercise.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. </strong><br></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s it from me.

Labor\u2019s superannuation package, which was released by <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> a fair while before the Coalition\u2019s package, should also be congratulated. Bowen essentially gave Morrison cover to work up superannuation reforms which could make a difference to the budget and get rid of a significant tax shelter. As Morrison said, people were stacking money into balances up to $100m paying no tax. Larf! </p> <p>Now you could say, Morrison should have run it past his own backbench before the budget to make for a neater policy package. It certainly would have saved a bit of angst and removed a stick for <strong>Eric Abetz</strong>. But hey, the broader point remains. If the generous concessions for largely high-income earners are wound back for the good of the budget and the savings figures are correct, <strong>Morrison and Turnbull done good</strong>. (All nuclear explosions kept to the comments thread, please.)</p> <p>Bowen will be out at midday. Morrison says he has spoken to him. We await with interest but could there be two policy reform handshakes in one week?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:47:49.653Z\">at 2.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9f3d8e4b067ad30087d44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:07:55.138Z\">2.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lastly \u2013 I promise \u2013 <strong>George Christensen</strong> gives the prime minister five stars for performance.

Can you understand, though, why most people would think that $100,000 a year out of after-tax income, is an extraordinarily high amount to enable someone to contribute to super out of their own pocket.

That is the product of a previous set of arrangements. </p> <p>That will have a legacy to it, understandably.

While some may call me a latte-sipping elite, I am no stranger to communities in the back blocks. I live in a small town and live among some people who for various reasons share some of the views of <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>. Some vote for her.</p> <p>I heard those views just prior to Hanson winning a seat in 1996. I had just moved out of the city and at that time, she was an anathema to me because I considered her and her supporters ignorant. Since coming to know the people in regional Australia, I don\u2019t think of her supporters in that way. They have issues which they want to see ventilated and putting a lid on them will not make them go away. Conversations help.</p> <p>But there is a difference between then and now, though the messages are similar. I covered that 1996 speech when she said Indigenous Australians were getting special benefits and we were being swamped by Asians. Now we are being swamped by Muslims, who are taking benefits, and the Asians, having done too well, are buying all our land. As <strong>Penny Wong</strong> said this morning, if she was around in the 50s it would have been the Greeks and Italians. I predict the Sudanese will come into focus in the future.<br></p> <p>The difference as I see it is this. In 1996, Hanson was unformed, politically naive, channelling views she heard in her family and in her community. The political process and Svengalis got a hold of her, chucked her in jail for a bit and she has emerged out the other side a different person. Strategic. Polished. That speech last night was a result. Deliberately hitting the same notes but choosing different victims. Smirking as the Greens staged their ill-advised walkout. As <strong>Tony Burke</strong> said she is not dumb, this was a deliberate, damaging, illogical but incendiary intervention. As much as I railed in 1996, I prefer that version. Pauline Hanson 2.0, in this security environment, has much more capacity for damage. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T23:42:34.389Z\">at 12.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9cf64e4b067ad30087c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T22:36:37.144Z\">11.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are looking around for powerful first speeches, check this one out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNKv2QttTY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/muNKv2QttTY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julian Leeser, new MP for Berowra, gives his first speech.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Leeser won the safe Liberal seat after <strong>Philip Ruddock</strong> retired. </p> <p>It\u2019s the personal experiences I think which shape the best first speeches.

  "<p>The European Union\u2019s trade negotiators are due to meet their US counterparts on Thursday amid growing speculation that talks over the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> have ground to a halt.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s trade chief, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, will meet US trade ambassador Michael Froman in a bid to rescue the TTIP talks at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday described as a \u201cstocktake\u201d of the negotiations so far.</p> <p>The two sides are understood to be preparing to put the talks on the back burner while policymakers consider complaints about a similar and equally controversial EU trade deal with Canada.</p> <p>The comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) deal with Canada is due to be ratified by the council of ministers next month prior to being debated by the Strasbourg parliament. But protests in Germany, France and Finland could wreck the agreement and with it the prospects for the TTIP talks.</p> <p>A gathering in Germany of SPD members next week at a special congress could force the left-of-centre party\u2019s leadership to reverse its support for CETA, and trigger widespread revolt across the continent against the deal and its cousin TTIP. </p> <p>Last month Sigmar Gabriel, the SPD leader and economy minister in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/29/eu-trade-negotiator-talks-down-ttip-failure-report-sigmar-gabriel\">\u201cin my opinion, the negotiations with the US have de facto failed</a>, even though nobody is really admitting it\u201d, though he remains a supporter of the CETA deal.</p> <p>EU officials believe the ailing European economy can only recover with the help of trade deals that harmonise rules and regulations, making it easier to sell goods and services abroad.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A spokesman for the commission said it was aiming to strike a comprehensive deal with the US. </p> <p>He said: \u201cSince the beginning of this year there has been a intensification of contact between negotiators, both at technical and political level.\u201d</p> <p>He denied that negotiators were shedding controversial elements of the talks to secure a deal before the US president, Barack Obama, leaves office at the end of the year.</p> <p>\u201cA quick deal would likely be a scaled down deal that would not include meaningful outcomes for most of the EU\u2019s interests. That would mean far fewer benefits for EU citizens. It is in the EU\u2019s interest that substance prevails over deadlines,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Jude Kirton-Darling, Labour MEP for north-east England and a member of the European parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the political arm-twisting needed to secure the CETA deal could spell the end for TTIP.</p> <p>\u201cTTIP has been stalled for months, and [Thursday\u2019s] meeting is merely a face-saving exercise for both the US and the EU. Political attention in Europe is now really focused on the finalised EU-Canada CETA deal, due to be ratified in the coming months, which up to now has been subject to less public scrutiny but raises many of the same concerns around standards, public services and the rule of law,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cLoud public declarations from EU leaders and their opposition to TTIP in recent weeks can only be understood in the context of growing public discontent over the CETA deal. TTIP\u2019s life support machine will be turned off if doing so helps to secure a majority in favour of CETA.\u201d</p> <p>TTIP has become the focus of anti-globalisation protests in the US and Europe with both presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, accusing the Obama administration of promoting a trade deal that would cost jobs and drive down wages.<br></p> <p>The European commission has come under intense pressure to abandon the talks following protests across Europe against provisions that campaigners argue will allow US companies to demand access to public sector contracts. Opponents have also complained that a separate courts system to resolve trade disputes will allow corporations to sue governments when new laws restrict their ability to make profits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Malmstr\u00f6m has overhauled the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system used in most trade deals, which anti-TTIP campaigners have described as a secretive courts process for the sole benefit of multinational corporations. She has proposed a more transparent version, which has retrospectively been inserted into the CETA agreement.</p> <p>The anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now has described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\">TTIP</a> as having \u201clittle to do with selling more products\u201d and being \u201cmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/david-cameron-support-ttip\">a charter for deregulation</a>, which threatens to change the way we make decisions about laws\u201d.</p> <p>This week Alfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, called for all future trade agreements to \u201cstipulate the primacy of human rights\u201d in a clear reference to the private courts systems included in TTIP and CETA deals. </p> <p>He said existing treaties should be revised to ensure that they did not conflict with the duty of government to fulfil binding human rights treaties and meet environmental and health goals. <br> </p>",
  "<p>Rectangles of pale blues and greens lie scattered across a sea of grey sand, looking a bit like someone dropped <a href=\"http://www.farrow-ball.com/colours/paint/fcp-category/list\">their Farrow &amp; Ball</a> colour swatches in a cat litter tray.

His team scouts potential subjects from the comfort of Google Earth, then with GPS technology Burtynsky can fix a position in the air by latitude, longitude and altitude, and send a drone-mounted camera back again and again to the exact same spot until he\u2019s happy with the shot.<br></p> <p>He is currently engaged in a five-year project on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever\">anthropocene</a>, the pending name for the present geological age in which humans have had a discernible impact on the environment, working in collaboration with scientists from the international <a href=\"http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/\">Anthropocene Working Group</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the five great extinctions,\u201d he says, referring to prehistoric devastations from the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d of the Permian eruptions, to the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. \u201cNow humans are having the equivalent effect of that meteor impact.\u201d</p> <p>If his message is one of impending catastrophe \u2013 or indeed a catastrophe that\u2019s already happened \u2013 it is tempered by the fact that these manmade scars are incredibly seductive.

On one spread, the mirror-glass skyline of Toronto, shot in the late afternoon sun, faces a gnarled hole in the ground in Australia, the sunset pinks and turquoises echoing the sandy soil and greenish lake at the bottom of the copper mine. \u201cWe build cities and leave holes in the ground where they came from,\u201d says Burtynsky. He refers to quarries as \u201cinverted skyscrapers\u201d.</p> <p>Flicking through the book is like touring the landscapes of late capitalism, tracing the supply chains of our consumer culture back to both ends \u2013 where the stuff came from and where it ends up. A field of shiny motorbikes is paired with a heap of tyres, an iron-ore mine with a ship-breaking yard. His post-production can be a little heavy-handed with the contrast and saturation levels, in the quest for pin-sharp clarity. But this is also part of his conscious aesthetic: images are pumped up until the entire picture plane is flattened into a surface seething with granular detail, or what he calls \u201cthe democratic distribution of light and space across the whole field,\u201d a neutrality that encourages the eye to wander.</p> <p>The flattening of these gaping scenes plunges the viewer headlong into the dams and reservoirs, aqueducts and deltas of this global survey. It brings a visceral sense of places that have been drained, drilled, excavated and extracted, terrains that have an archaic, almost primordial feeling. This is the fundamental matter from which human civilisation has been wrought, the landscapes that have been squeezed and scraped for their material worth, ravaged and disfigured on an epic scale, leaving beautiful residue in their wake.</p> <p>\u201cIn our ephemeral information age, people think we\u2019ve left behind the stone, bronze and iron ages,\u201d says Burtynsky. \u201cBut they\u2019re all still going on \u2013 we use tonnes of this stuff every day.

  "<p>At a digital innovation consultancy in central Helsinki, the men\u2019s toilets were causing something of an inconvenience. The Finnish company, Futurice, employs many male employees and the bathrooms were often occupied.</p> <p>However, now they can find out if one is free without leaving their desk. An app with a live map of the office tells them. \u201cThe bathrooms on the map turn red when they\u2019re occupied and green when they\u2019re unoccupied. Then you know where to go,\u201d says Paul Houghton, who has the grand title of director of wizardry and development at Futurice.<br></p> <p>The live map was created by Houghton and his colleagues to explore whether internet of things (IoT) technologies, where objects communicate with each other over the internet, could improve working life for staff and also save them time. <br></p> <p>It displays real-time information about what\u2019s happening in the office, for example quiet places to work. Using Wi-Fi beacon triangulation, it shows where someone is in the building at a particular moment (their marker moves when they move) and is designed to encourage ad hoc social interactions and make it easy to find people. Soon it will have a heat map showing areas that are particularly warm or cool.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a poll, 58%\u200b said IoT increased collaboration while 54% believed it raised productivity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Houghton, who is the mastermind behind project V\u00f6r, says: \u201cWe built the whole service around the idea of indoor location. It\u2019s an experiment in creating the office of the future. But it\u2019s also because we moved office from one part of Helsinki to the centre where we have a new open [plan] office type of environment and there were some problems with this new space that we felt we could address with technology.\u201d<br></p> <p>A designer was brought in and staff were interviewed about what they wanted. Besides the bathroom issue, another common irritation was around hot-desking. \u201cBecause we\u2019re right in the centre of town we have less space and because we\u2019re a consultancy our people are away on customer site. So when you come in you don\u2019t have a permanent place to work. The first thing you think when you walk in is: where am I going to sit today? Where are my friends or teammates?\u201d<br></p> <p>The team began experimenting. Beacons, (Futurice uses small wireless sensors that can attach to a location or object, they broadcast tiny radio signals which a smartphone can receive and interpret), switches, cameras and air quality sensors were placed around the office, and these communicate with employees\u2019 phones over the office network via the Android app. Motion sensors send information to the map about which desks are free.<br></p> <p>However, the experiment has discovered that, in certain areas of office life, the technology wasn\u2019t welcome. \u201cWe put motion sensors in the [men\u2019s] bathrooms, and I thought it would be interesting to also put in an air-quality sensor in the bathroom, so it would sense methane in this case,\u201d says Houghton. \u201cBut I was kicked out of the ladies\u2019 room with my tail between my legs because they told me, in no uncertain terms, that this is their private space and they didn\u2019t want any spaceship-looking sensors.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a light-hearted point but highlights serious concerns around the internet of things and privacy. While knowing where your colleagues are in real time might be useful, isn\u2019t there something sinister about being able to watch a colleague\u2019s every move? Offices can breed resentments and personality clashes, so how can they ensure this won\u2019t be used against people?<br></p> <p>Houghton points out the project has been created by staff, not the company, and they have endeavoured to put the user in control of their own information. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely opt-in system. It\u2019s been created by a few of us employees playing around. You can turn it off \u2026 or you can just not install it on your phone. Not everyone uses it, for sure.\u201d </p> <p>Then there\u2019s the question of the data generated and what happens to it. Houghton says none of the information leaves the office. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the cloud. It\u2019s not written down anywhere. There\u2019s no record, it\u2019s just what\u2019s happening near me right now.\u201d They have no plans to sell the software, says Houghton, it\u2019s just for internal use.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s unsurprising that businesses are experimenting with the internet of things. Those that use these technologies experience clear benefits, according to a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/verizon/18980_HBR_Verizon_IoT_Nov_14.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey </a>in 2014 by the Harvard Business Review. Of those polled, 58% said it increased collaboration within the business while 54% believed it increased employee productivity.<br></p> <p>Mike Gotta, research vice president at IT research and advisory company Gartner, says the idea of \u201cindoor mapping\u201d, or a \u201cGoogle maps for the building\u201d could become a handy tool for office staff. \u201cImagine you\u2019re a new hire at a big company, you\u2019re going to meet someone but you don\u2019t know where they sit.

E-commerce company Klarna, based in the UK and Sweden, and US-based Twilio have connected live data and messages to screens throughout the office to keep staff updated in real time or to say thank you to someone who helped out a fellow employee.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re merely scraping the surface of what could be achieved if more offices look at how they can adopt the internet of things and data to improve everything from operations to sales, and happiness to product development,\u201d says Grech.<br></p> <p>Many people will feel uncomfortable with the idea of technology being deployed to promote their happiness at work. However Futurice\u2019s Houghton doesn\u2019t see it that way. They haven\u2019t measured whether staff productivity has increased.

The rest were just general supporters of the idea.</p> <p>E-residency is self-funded, with the costs coming from people who register.

The organisation emerged four years ago at a time of mounting climatic stress in Santiago.</p> <p>A recent protest saw at least 2,000 people take to the capital\u2019s streets to demand the repeal of laws that privatised Chile\u2019s water supply. At the heart of the protest and others like it in recent years lies frustration that the privatisation of water has kept prices unnecessarily high, delivered poor service and done little to address concerns over insufficient supply in the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9011aa417b8915449265e533644a33987c3ecddf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9011aa417b8915449265e533644a33987c3ecddf/723_283_3528_2117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street flooded from the overflowing of the Mapocho river during heavy rains in Santiago on April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flooded Santiago street during April\u2019s heavy rains, when 4 million people were left without tap water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Diaz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With water availability to Santiago <a href=\"http://sdcenter.org/santiago-climate-risk-and-response/\" rel=\"nofollow\">predicted</a> to fall 40% by 2070, residents are right to be concerned about the future of their water. For Fern\u00e1ndez, while climate change poses a serious threat to the city\u2019s water supplies, she believes the issue is principally political: \u201cThe root of the problem lies in the commodification of the nation\u2019s water under [Pinochet\u2019s] dictatorship,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The process of water privatisation in Chile which began in 1981 under General Pinochet established a model for water management that strengthened private water rights, adopted a market-based allocation system and reduced state oversight. That model became emblematic of neoliberal reforms heavily promoted by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>These reforms fundamentally changed the way water is valued and managed globally. No longer a mere necessity for human survival, water has become an object of international financial speculation and experts <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/willem-buiter-water-2011-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">predict</a> that \u201cblue gold\u201d will soon become the most important physical commodity worldwide, dwarfing oil and precious metals.</p> <p>Pinochet\u2019s political demise in 1990 was not the end of Chile\u2019s faith in a privatised water supply. If anything, that faith deepened following the return to democracy, with legislation in 1998 clearing the way for international firms to buy up the nation\u2019s water utilities. </p> <p>Aguas Andinas, for example, a subsidiary of transnationals <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-18/suez-environnement-to-buy-rest-of-spanish-water-utility-agbar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agbar and Suez</a>, monopolises Santiago\u2019s market today, selling water to 6 million of the city\u2019s 7.2 million residents at <a href=\"http://www.bnamericas.com/es/features/aguasyresiduos/las-tarifas-mas-y-menos-costosas-de-las-empresas-de-aguas-de-latinoamerica\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of the highest tariffs</a> in Latin America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27da84636dc5ed12c81aae8b227b75d560b72426\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27da84636dc5ed12c81aae8b227b75d560b72426/0_136_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Valparaiso\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water protests are not unique to Santiago.

A government body \u2013 the Water Directorate \u2013 is meant to be in charge of water planning, but Barton says it has no control over water, \u201cbeyond basically giving it away to private owners\u201d.</p> <p>But there are signs of a government change of heart, perhaps spurred by public sentiment: a new <a href=\"http://www.mediabanco.com/2016/08/16/61-los-chilenos-considera-urge-reemplazar-las-afp-sistema-publico-solidario/\" rel=\"nofollow\">poll</a> suggests that 74% of Chileans support a return to the public ownership of water. The Chilean government\u2019s special <a href=\"https://www.camara.cl/trabajamos/comision_portada.aspx?prmID=720\" rel=\"nofollow\">committee on water resources</a> recently proposed reforms to national water laws. Those proposals, now under discussion in congress, would prioritise human consumption over commercial use and grant the Water Directorate new oversight powers.</p> <p>The private sector is resisting reform, however. The Confederation of Production and Commerce, representing the Chilean private sector, made its opposition clear in a <a href=\"http://www.cpc.cl/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Declaracion-publica-CPC-sobre-regimen-juridico-de-propiedad-de-derechos-de-aguas.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">statement</a> (pdf) last month.

Barton says climate change requires \u201cradical change\u201d if future water crises are to be avoided and he doesn\u2019t believe that change will happen within the current privatised water system.</p> <p>Chile\u2019s legislators should begin by listening to the demands from the streets. It makes sense to prioritise human and ecological needs over profits. It also makes sense to have a serious conversation about reforms to water ownership and oversight in the search for a durable solution to the country\u2019s water troubles.</p>",

Some of the poorest countries committed to modernising their schools are still receiving woefully low levels of aid. Togo, a much improved performer, receives just $7 per pupil.

To fund this, a begging bowl circulated years into the crisis must now be replaced by guaranteed provision available at the outset.</p> <p>The dividends will be profound. Education is the greatest anti-poverty investment we can make and with infant mortality among educated mothers half the rate of the uneducated, one of the most impactful health interventions. Our estimate is that, if our recommendations are accepted, GDP per capita in low-income countries will be 70% higher in 2050, and poverty 20% lower.</p> <p>Seventy years ago, international cooperation and statesmanship brought forth the Marshall plan to rebuild broken-down countries, the World Bank and the IMF to finance their reconstruction and the United Nations to secure the rights of their citizens. This was a time of enlightened self-interest, a time when the world saw a positive-sum pathway to improving the human condition.

By then, a capacity crunch will have hit the UK as old power stations close.</p> <p>Hinkley puts a lot of generation capacity in one plan , which is very risky given the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-fails-all-tests-bar-the-politics\">financial, legal and technical obstacles</a> it faces. EDF, the French company leading the project, is taking on considerable financial risk, with Martin Young, an energy analyst at investment bank RBC Capital Markets, saying the project \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-nuclear-plant-edf-still-on-track-ministers-insist\">verges on insanity</a>\u201d. </p> <p>Court challenges \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/31/edf-representatives-file-legal-challenge-in-france-over-hinkley-point\">including from EDF\u2019s own trade unions</a> \u2013 abound and the fiendishly complex project has been described by one nuclear engineer as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/nuclear-environmentalists-scrap-hinkley-c-plans\">unconstructable</a>. Two attempts to build the same reactor in France and Finland are miles over budget and behind schedule.</p> <p>In contrast, energy efficiency could deliver <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capturing-the-full-electricity-efficiency-potential-of-the-uk--2\">six Hinkleys\u2019 worth of electricity</a> by 2030, according to the government\u2019s own research. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-smart-power-revolution-could-save-consumers-8-billion-a-year-adonis\">Four Hinkleys\u2019 worth</a> could be saved by increasing the ability to store electricity and making the grid smarter, with the latter alone likely to save billpayers \u00a38bn a year. </p> <p>Capturing and storing carbon from fossil fuel plants is also vital, but has received scant attention from the government compared with Hinkley. It would halve the cost of beating global warming, according to government\u2019s own official advisers, but in November ministers abruptly canned its plan. The government will not be able to get out of the Hinkley deal, however. Once signed, the deal with EDF contains a \u201cpoison pill\u201d which could leave taxpayers with a \u00a322bn bill if a future UK government shuts down the plant.</p> <p>The government has remained adamant that Hinkley, which could provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity, is a vital part of a secure low-carbon future. But it is not just the idea of EDF\u2019s partner, a Chinese state company, being involved that creates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/energy-specialists-raise-concerns-on-chinese-hinkley-involvement\">security fears</a>.

One back-up option recently favoured by the government is to deploy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/diesel-farms-built-subsidies-national-grid-auction\">farms of diesel generators</a>, which emit large volumes of carbon dioxide, ready to start up when needed. </p> <p>Yet in a smart, distributed system, knocking out one wind turbine or solar panel is barely noticed by the grid. </p> <p> The risk with Hinkley is that will it bring about the mutually assured destruction of both EDF and UK energy policy, with an expensive, hard-to-build reactor, in which the taxpayer will end up footing the bill.</p>",

The process for managing complaints relating to advertisements of therapeutic goods will also be simplified, with stronger compliance powers against misleading advertising.</p> <p>However, though there will be stricter penalties for false and misleading advertising of medical products, the government will abolish the current process of pre-clearing advertisements.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the reforms sponsors will be encouraged to publish on their website the evidence that it holds to support all indications included on the product as well as information that will assist consumers to compare complementary medicines,\u201d Ley said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/18/chiropractic-board-australia-should-be-sacked-members-contentious-claims\">Chiropractic Board of Australia \u2018should be sacked\u2019 over members' contentious claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAdvertising for therapeutic products will be simplified but there will be stricter penalties for non-compliance.\u201d </p> <p>But Dr Ken Harvey, an adjunct associate professor at the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University who served on the TGA\u2019s transparency review panel, said abolishing the current pre-clearance of advertisements would \u201copen the floodgates of crazy claims\u201d, many of which currently get picked up and prevented. </p> <p>\u201cIn addition, the worst offenders of misleading and deceptive claims are not members of industry associations, so self-regulation offered by industry associations will not pick these up,\u201d said Harvey, who was a member of the expert group that drafted the World Health Organisation\u2019s ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion. </p> <p> He said a proposed education program for manufacturers was \u201ca furphy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst offenders know the rules and deliberately breach them because they make money doing so,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough more post-marketing surveillance and better penalties for breaches is good, it is attempting to shut the gate after the horse has bolted.

Talk of creating a register was renewed after the PIP breast implant scandal. The implants were prone to rupturing and created a range of medical problems for women. Without a register, there was no way to determine exactly how many Australian women had received PIPs or who they were.</p> <p>But, in response to the recommendation, the government said \u201cestablishing and maintaining registries requires careful consideration of the range of registries managed by a variety of organisations and how they could be sustainably managed and funded in the future\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Chris Del Mar, an evidence-based medicine specialist, said he was concerned by expediting approval of products that had already been approved by regulators overseas. He said different agencies had different thresholds for approving drugs. </p> <p>For example, the Food and Drug Administration in the US does not approve neuraminidase inhibitors [used in antiviral drugs] for reducing serious complications of influenza, while the European Agency does, with each body interpreting the evidence in different ways. </p> <p>\u201cWe think this might be because of different access to confidential trials data,\u201d Del Mar said. \u201cBut this means that approvals might be based on the least stringent process, in a field we know is fraught with commercial pressures \u2013 often subtly worked through unwitting patient groups. </p> <p>\u201cWhen there is still doubt about a drug\u2019s efficacy and safety, it\u2019d be far better to use it in an experimental mode, when we can collect randomised data to help assuage our uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Cancer Council Australia chief executive, Prof Sanchia Aranda, said the recommendations were \u201can important step in the right direction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, the recommendations supported by government, such as accepting assessments from comparable overseas regulators, should speed up the process of subsidising vital medicines in Australia,\u201d Aranda said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will need to look at the detail more closely to get a better sense of how they will address current inequities. The government should nonetheless be commended for its response.\u201d</p>",

The Russians have basically hacked into both parties at the national level and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are.</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI director would tell you they\u2019re just trying to undermine the integrity of the process,\u201d McCaul continued, after Blitzer noted that if Russia had hacked the RNC, it was news to him. \u201cThey are not discriminating one party against the other.</p> <p>\u201cThey have hacked into the RNC, so this is, again, they\u2019re not picking sides here, I don\u2019t think,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re hacking into both political parties.

Clinton placed half of Trump supporters in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d on 9 September and stumbled upon leaving the World Trade Center on 11 September. Trump led Clinton 44-39 in a four-way race in the poll, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson scoring an impressive 10 points.</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, which has picked the winner in every presidential election since 1964.

  "<p>Parklets are popping up everywhere. Cities around the world \u2013 and increasingly across Australia, from <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-18/pop-up-parks-catch-on-in-perth/6788094\">Fremantle</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.qt.com.au/news/council-approves-parklet-trial-effort-improve-busi/1799512/\">Fraser coast</a> \u2013 are introducing programs to convert roadside parking spots into more green and sociable spaces.</p> <p>In Sydney, Waverley council\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.waverley.nsw.gov.au/building/current_projects/bondi_junction_projects/great_places/urban_interventions\">Urban Interventions</a> program received an award for \u201cbest planning idea\u201d from the Planning Institute of Australia (New South Wales) in 2014. The Glebe Chamber of Commerce is running a <a href=\"mailto:https://pozible.com/project/glebe-parklet-share-your-city\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to turn its pilot parklet into a more lasting installation.</p> <p>Before parklets there was <a href=\"http://rebargroup.org/parking/\">PARK(ing)</a>. In 2005, members of the San Francisco design collective Rebar paid an on-street parking meter for two hours. Rebar used the space to create a \u201cpark\u201d with turf, a tree, a bench and signs inviting passersby to sit and relax. It then packed up and returned the space to its former condition.</p> <p>While the event was not intended to continue beyond the initial two hours, photos and video were rapidly shared online. The images proved inspirational: requests quickly came from people asking how to create their own \u201cparks\u201d. Rebar responded by producing a how-to guide and launched an event that would make a much bigger statement about the use of public space.</p> <h2>Going global</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e96487294e3f17e23a6dcf68c447b5893cd795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e96487294e3f17e23a6dcf68c447b5893cd795/0_25_754_452/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebar\u2019s original pop-up park in San Francisco in 2005\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From little things: Rebar\u2019s original pop-up park in San Francisco in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: my.parkingday.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2006 the first <a href=\"http://parkingday.org/archive/\">PARK(ing) Day</a> was celebrated with 47 \u201cparks\u201d in 13 cities across three countries. The event grew rapidly, expanding to more than 200 parks in 2007 and featuring in the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2008. By 2011 PARK(ing) Day included almost 1,000 parks in 35 countries.</p> <p>PARK(ing) Day has spread beyond the event itself. As well as parklet programs, the first of which was introduced in <a href=\"http://pavementtoparks.org/parklets/\">San Francisco</a> in 2010, participants have gone on to develop a range of related events \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3069577/Skipsters-Charity-Melbourne-creates-mobile-park-street-using-SKIP-look-trendy-alternative-place-hang-out.html\">skipsters</a> of Melbourne to the <a href=\"http://www.mtlblog.com/2015/05/montreals-free-summer-boardwalk-village-is-back-this-june/\">temporary villages</a> of Montreal to the worldwide <a href=\"http://betterblock.org/\">Better Block</a> movement.</p> <p>At the core of PARK(ing) Day is an idea about law. Paying the parking meter was seen as a way to access ownership, albeit temporarily, in a city where the means to acquire legal title were beyond the reach of many residents.<br></p> <p>Its instigators described this act as creating a \u201clease\u201d, a property right that brought with it a right to engage in planning, by participating in the development of a vision of what could be and, significantly, in the (fleeting) material creation of that vision.</p> <p>At first, the vision was for more parks in an area that \u2013 according to the city\u2019s own maps \u2013 had little green space. In subsequent iterations in cities around the world, PARK(ing) Day participants have claimed and reclaimed the street in diverse and dynamic ways: from croquet greens to community health clinics, libraries to lemonade stands, bike workshops to weddings.</p> <p>Turning a parking space into a park is a quirky idea but even in 2005 it was not entirely new. Precedents can be found in many cities over many years: from the installations on California roads by Bonnie Ora Sherk in the 1970s, to the <a href=\"http://tlchamilton.blogspot.com/2001/07/parking-meter-party.html\">Parking Meter Parties</a> held in Hamilton, Ontario, from 2001, to Ted Dewan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.wormworks.com/roadwitch/pages/livingroom.htm\">road witching</a> in Oxford, the UK, from 2003, to Michael Rakowitz\u2019s 2004 <a href=\"http://www.michaelrakowitz.com/plot-proposition-i/\">(P)LOT</a> projects in Vienna, Austria, and Trento, Italy.</p> <p>Yet none of these precursors succeeded in engaging or inspiring people on such a grand scale.</p> <h2>The power of a \u2018sticky\u2019 idea</h2> <p>Rebar describes PARK(ing) Day as a \u201csticky\u201d idea. With very little organisation \u2013 almost none in recent years, since Rebar no longer exists \u2013 the event has proved extremely durable.</p> <p>While some participants engage consistently over many years (the Sydney office of <a href=\"http://fieldsofactivity.com/parking-day/\">Arup has built \u201cparks\u201d</a> seven times since 2008), most take part just a few times. Yet PARK(ing) Day continues to attract new participants: North Sydney girls high school and locals around Australia Street, Newtown, are some of the newest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjMLGCingNo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZjMLGCingNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The reach of PARK(ing) may be traced to the power of the initial image, or to the success (or luck) of Rebar in connecting with particularly influential people.</p> <p>But a key part of the event\u2019s success is its connection to law. PARK(ing) Day was not presented as a protest, a plea for change, or a proposal for reform. On the contrary, PARK(ing) Day was expressly presented as something already legal. PARK(ing) Day provides a powerful invitation to citizens around the world to rethink the city and their place in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The\u00a0Conversation&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64359/count.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em>\u2022 Friday, 16 September, is the 11th PARK(ing) Day.

  "<p>From giving women the vote to repealing the White Australia Policy, the Australian parliament has an amazing history of taking the transformative decisions that make this country so great today. </p> <p>On issues like economic reform and gun control, Australia was well ahead of its time and we\u2019re still seen as a global leader. </p> <p>That great history makes it all the more bizarre that we\u2019re on the brink of handballing the next big social change \u2013 marriage equality \u2013 to an expensive and unnecessary plebiscite, rather than dealing with it in parliament like every other decision that doesn\u2019t need a change to the constitution. </p> <p>When we elect our MPs, we trust and expect them to make those calls.

Given that the rate of depression for gay Australians is much higher than the national average, that\u2019s a serious concern.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about giving people time and space for a national debate. Australians have been talking about marriage equality seriously since the early 2000s and we already have the forums for people to express their views on both sides, including the media and the parliament itself. The issue is with using taxpayer funds in a way that could give a platform to the worst kind of homophobic rhetoric \u2013 without even binding parliament to the result. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z2h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714138\"            data-video-name=\"Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7a185e4b08465d4500198\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913gaymarriage_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\">Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There have only been three plebiscites in Australian history and the last one was the vote on whether to change a national anthem \u201cAdvance Australia Fair\u201d.

Hoth Mai served as the chief of staff and deputy chief of logistics of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army before being dismissed in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe residence is situated on a one-acre lot backing up to a forested area bordering nearby Lysterfield Lake, a popular destination for sailing, canoeing and mountain biking,\u201d the Sentry report says. </p> <p>\u201cThe home boasts four bedrooms, a top-of-the-line kitchen, a two-tiered home theatre, a sauna and an infinity pool. When the Sentry visited the home in August 2016, a BMW 316 used by one of Hoth Mai\u2019s daughters was parked in front of the house. </p> <p>\u201cThe home was described by the real estate agency that sold it as \u2018perfecting the balance between serenity and glamour\u2019. </p> <p>The agent who sold Hoth Mai the home, and who did not want to be named, told Guardian Australia that he thought the family \u201cwere lovely and very well-mannered and well-educated\u201d.</p> <p>Contrary to the Sentry report\u2019s claims, he said the property was originally bought in Hoth Mai\u2019s wife\u2019s name, not his son\u2019s. The name was transferred to his son at settlement. The agent said he did show Hoth Mai through the home once and that the property had been paid for using money transferred from overseas bank accounts, including from Dubai. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/south-sudan-general-on-60k-paid-15m-cash-for-melbourne-mansion/news-story/0989507a63845168e03df6fdf8d577c2\">a report in the Australian</a>, the former owner of the home grew suspicious of the Hoth Mai family owing to difficulties with the settlement, including the family experiencing trouble getting money out of Dubai. He reported his concerns to the Foreign Investment Review Board but told the Australian the board \u201cdidn\u2019t want a bar of it\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has sought comment from Hoth Mai.</p> <p>In July Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, announced $8m in funding for the South Sudan humanitarian fund and the UN high commissioner for refugees to deliver deliver food, shelter, security and other assistance to South Sudanese who had fled the conflict to neighbouring countries. It brought Australia\u2019s total contribution to South Sudan to more than $50m since December 2013.</p> <p> The Sentry report also states that the president, Salva Kiir, and the opposition leader, Riek Machar, had both amassed wealth from the conflict, which they had shared with their family through luxury trips, cars and homes.<br></p> <p>\u201cSeveral of President Kiir\u2019s other children have attended high school and college in Australia, Malaysia and Uganda,\u201d the report said. </p> <p>\u201cAnd President Kiir\u2019s children appear to travel internationally for more than just their education.

While fiction might be the catalyst for this discussion, in the eyes of Abdel-Magied and others the issues are deeply rooted in real-world politics and a long history.</p> <p>The image of the blackface minstrel artist of 1830s America \u2013 the white performer painted up to look like a caricature of an African-American person and performing comic skits \u2013 is perhaps the most oft-invoked example of cultural appropriation from history. <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/sfeature/sf_minstrelsy.html#\">The racial dynamic of minstrelsy was complex</a> \u2013 it was performed by African-American and Anglo actors alike \u2013 but while African-American performers often sought to gain financial security from the practice and in some cases use their platform to <a href=\"http://exhibits.lib.usf.edu/exhibits/show/minstrelsy/jimcrow-to-jolson/african-american-performers\">counter negative public stereotypes of themselves</a>, white performers reinforced those stereotypes. This occurred within a society which still had not abolished slavery, and in which the political power dynamic was very much racialized. As the civil rights movement grew, so did criticism of white people attempting to exploit the images and experiences of people of colour for social and financial gain. </p> <p>This pattern is repeated around the world, particularly in places that experienced colonisation and slavery, such as India, Australia and South Africa. As scholars, artists, activists and writers of colour fought to gain access to predominantly white institutions and public spaces, and gained visibility in the cultural sphere, they began to criticise the inaccurate representations of themselves they saw created by and for the profit of others.</p> <p>The issue has been heavily explored within the academies but has gathered momentum in popular culture over the past decade. It underpins criticism of, among other things, Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/iggy_azaleas_post_racial_mess_americas_oldest_race_tale_remixed/\">sonic blackness</a>\u201d, Coldplay\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/coldplay-beyonce-hymn-for-the-weekend-cultural-appropriation-india\">myopic construction of India</a>\u201d in their music videos, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/miley-cyrus-twerking-cultural-appropriation\">Miley Cyrus\u2019s dance moves</a>.

The difference between cultural representation and cultural appropriation, by this logic, lies in the white writer telling stories (and therefore taking publishing opportunities) that would be better suited to a writer of colour.</p> <p>Some writers argue that it works in reverse, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/30/marlon-james-writers-of-colour-pander-white-woman-man-booker-event-brief-history-seven-killings\">In an event for the Guardian in November last year</a>, Booker Prize-winning author Marlon James said publishers too often \u201cpander to the white woman\u201d (the majority of the book-buying public), causing writers of colour to do the same.

  "<p>A new report has found a \u201cvast\u201d gender wage gap exists within sport, with female athletes battling for better pay in a billion-dollar industry that remains predominantly male.</p> <p>The 2016 Gender Balance in Global Sport report, written in the lead-up to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, was released on Thursday by Women on Boards, an advocacy organisation based in the UK and Australia. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.womenonboards.net/womenonboards-AU/media/AU-Reports/2016-Gender-Balance-In-Global-Sport-Report.pdf\">update to its inaugural report</a> published in June 2014 included data sourced from more than 300 bodies, and showed significant differences in pay for men and women in basketball, golf and football. There had been progress made towards parity in cycling and cricket, while athletics and tennis offered just about equal renumeration for men and women.</p> <p>But despite \u201csome brighter spots\u201d, the report concluded a \u201clong journey to pay parity\u201d remained.</p> <p>Claire Braund, the executive director of Women on Boards, said in a statement the discrepancy reflected persistent bias that \u201cwomen\u2019s sport is not as physical and not as good to watch\u201d. The gender pay gap was seen by some as an inevitability of the increasingly commercial nature of sport, she said.</p> <p>\u201cHad our culture been used to seeing women, rather than men, play football and rugby for generations, we would find the idea of men playing these games a bit novel.

That was made possible by a new broadcast partnership with Nine and Telstra, she said. Braund has been contacted for comment by Guardian Australia. </p> <p>Researchers did find some positive indications that some sporting bodies were working to address the pay gap. Top female cricketers in Australia, England, Wales and India have had their cases for central contracts \u2013 which allow them to play professionally year-round \u2013 bolstered by the success of the T20 format of the game.</p> <p>Braund said the shorter game had raised female players\u2019 profiles through increased ground audiences and television coverage, leading to sponsorship opportunities.</p> <p>But she said there was slow progress in women\u2019s football, and pointed to lack of representation at the top of the sport. \u201cThe main governing bodies in world football have few women on their boards. The situation was the same in UK football bodies, but she noted that Australia had three women in senior positions on its professional independent board.</p> <p>This was a widespread problem across sport, the report found, with many global governing bodies reporting fewer than 30% of board seats held by women. Across the 28 International Sports Federations, women board members represented 18% of the total, and that figure dropped to 16.6% for the 129 National Olympic Committees assessed for the report \u2013 despite a target of 20% set for both by the International Olympic Committee in 2005.</p> <p>Only Malawi, Australia, Bermuda, Norway, New Zealand, Kiribati, Samoa and Tuvalu had more than 40% women on their national Olympic boards and committees. The USA had 31.3% women and the UK, 26.7%. Many bodies that recorded increases were comparing to bases of 0% in the 2014 report.</p> <p>With election and selection processes a key factor in the imbalance, Braun said there was a clear need for reform of \u201cboth the governance and leadership\u201d in global sport to facilitate women to play a greater role.<br></p> <p>The report\u2019s recommendations remained the same as in 2014: mandating governance processes, pay attention to the composition and operation of boards, leading by example, and disclosure over funding and gender composition.</p>"
