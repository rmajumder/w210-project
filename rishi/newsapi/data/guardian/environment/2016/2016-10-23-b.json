  "<p>The first two user tutorials are pretty stock standard but, from there, things escalate dramatically. After mastering How to Sign Up and How to Recover Your Password, users are apparently ready to advance to lesson number three: How to Create a Democracy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As it turns out, on <a href=\"http://democracyos.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DemocracyOS</a>, this is a relatively straightforward matter \u2013 no overthrowing the previous regime nor exterminating the last traces of the royal lineage in order to pave the way for a new world order. Instead Argentinian developers Democracia en Red have made it a simple matter of clicking a button to form a group and thrash out the policies voters wish to see enacted.</p> <p>It is one of a range of digital platforms for direct democracy created by developers and activists to redefine the relationship between citizens and their governments, with the powers that be in Latin American city councils through to European anti-austerity parties making the upgrade to democracy 2.0.</p> <p>Reshaping how government works is a difficult enough pitch by itself but, beyond that, there\u2019s another challenge facing developers \u2013 the online trolls are ready and waiting. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/20/is-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-bad-news-for-migrants-and-refugees\">Is the fourth industrial revolution bad news for migrants and refugees?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain alone this year offered up two examples of what impact trolls could have on online direct democracy \u2013 there was the case of \u201cBoaty McBoatface\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/17/boaty-mcboatface-wins-poll-to-name-polar-research-vessel\">famously winning a Natural Environment Research Council poll</a> to determine the name of a multimillion-pound arctic research vessel, and then there was the more serious case of trolls <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/petition-for-second-eu-referendum-may-have-been-manipulated\">adding the signatures of thousands of residents of countries such as the Cayman Islands and Vatican City</a> to a formal petition calling for a second Brexit referendum, in order to have the entire document disregarded as an online prank. </p> <p>In the US presidential election even the politicians are getting in on it, with a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC (political action committee) hiring <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-digital-trolling-20160506-snap-htmlstory.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an army of online commenters to defend the candidate in arguments on social media</a>, while the Republican contender, Donald Trump, is himself engaging in textbook trolling behaviour \u2013 whether that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">urging the hacking of Clinton\u2019s emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/22/donald-trump-reveals-republican-rival-lindsey-grahams-phone-number-on-tv\">revealing the phone number of a Republican rival during the primaries</a>, or unleashing a constant stream of controversial statements as a means of derailing conversations, attracting attention and humiliating his targets. </p> <p>So what does this mean for digital platforms for direct democracy? By merging the world of the internet with that of politics, will we all end up governed by some fusion of trolls and Trumps promising to build Wally McWallfaces on our borders? And will the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution also usher in a revolution in how democracy functions? </p> <p>Richard D. Bartlett, the cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.loomio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loomio</a> \u2013 the platform of choice for numerous direct democracy initiatives including Spain\u2019s Podemos party \u2013 says setting boundaries is key to safeguarding against trolls.</p> <p>\u201cAt Loomio we developed our community moderation policy in collaboration with our community, so our moderators have an explicit mandate to act,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout clear boundaries, you immediately exclude everyone that doesn\u2019t want to expose themselves to harassment. It\u2019s like saying \u2018we only want jerks here please\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Shefali V Virkar, the author of the University of Oxford study Trolls Just Want To Have Fun: Electronic Aggression Within the Context of e-Participation and Other Online Political Behaviour in the United Kingdom, says direct democracy initiatives have largely avoided trolling problems partly due to their heavy moderation of disruptive behaviour but also because, to date, such platforms have been considered too small and irrelevant to be worth targeting.</p> <p>If such initiatives grow as large as their developers envision, however, effective moderation will become increasingly challenging to maintain and Virkar suggests the employment of stricter registration criteria to stop trolls joining in the first place. </p> <p>\u201cThere is little much else that platform owners can do to curtail trolling and the chief challenge here is now for platform owners to balance website security with freedom of expression,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/14/why-teaching-graduates-to-be-flexible-is-more-important-than-worrying-about-jobs-that-dont-yet-exist\">Why teaching graduates to be flexible is more important than worrying about jobs that don't yet exist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An example of how this balance might be difficult for developers to achieve can be found in perhaps the world\u2019s most successful direct democracy party, Italy\u2019s Five Stars movement, which in six years of existence has risen to become one of the country\u2019s major political forces. </p> <p>In his 2015 book, Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement: Organisation, Communication and Ideology, the Italian political scientist Filippo Tronconi analysed the content of a random sample of comments removed from the party\u2019s policy sounding board website between 19 September and 10 November in 2013. He found that, while the comments deleted by the comedian-turned-party leader Beppe Grillo were almost all critical, many were communicated in a calm and polite manner.</p> <p>\u201cBy describing dissenters as trolls, Grillo exploits web culture to implicitly gain censorship authority over the debate: according to the ethics of online communities, \u2018flames\u2019 [i.e. deliberately provocative comments) can be legitimately deleted by the administrators for the sake of the conversation,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>In Australia, the <a href=\"https://voteflux.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">app developer-cum-political party Flux</a> is looking to bitcoin for answers.

  "<p>If you discover your favourite aromatic plants and herbs are looking chewed this autumn the culprit is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/apr/18/gardens\">rosemary beetle</a> <em>(</em><em>Chrysolina Americana), </em>an unwelcome new addition to the UK\u2019s gardens \u2013 thanks to climate change.</p> <p>Despite its name, <em>Americana, </em>its original home is the Mediterranean and North Africa, but the increasing warmth of the British climate means it can now survive and thrive here. It was first seen London in 1994 and after a slow start it has rapidly spread in England and now reached Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>While, as the name suggests, it is often found on rosemary, it also eats lavender, sage, thyme and other related aromatic herbs. These are plants which are normally pest free so this makes the beetle a doubly annoying invader.</p> <p>Both the rather startling metallic green and purple striped adult beetles and the more inconspicuous slug-like greyish white larvae feed on the same plants, chewing their leaves to stumps. The adults, about 6-8mm long, can be found at any time of year, but larvae that grow to the same size, are particularly active during warm autumn weather. A large infestation can reduce most of the plants in the herb garden to skeletons by spring.</p> <p>This has alarmed, among others, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which has a <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=555\">helpful guide to this invader</a> and how to control it. It also has a campaign to try and track where the beetle has now reached.</p> <p>The most <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-BUNHiA1N4\">recent map</a> shows that it is now all over the south-east of England but elsewhere seems to do best in cities, like Manchester, where it is warmer. Large areas of countryside with frosty winters are so far still free of this pest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/pests-moths-carpets\">The curious case of the case-bearing carpet moth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the problems with control is that many people grow the species that the beetle eats (apart from lavender) to flavour their cooking. Most pesticides which kill the beetles and their lava, also render the herbs uneatable, although the RHS suggest some brands that the makers say are not harmful to humans. However, pesticides will also kill a lot of beneficial insects including bees.</p> <p>Picking the adult beetles off is laborious so the RHS recommends giving the plants a good shake. On the advice site is a helpful video demonstrating how to place a big piece of white paper under a rosemary bush to catch them all. Someone else suggested an upturned umbrella. How this works for low growing thyme is not shown. In any event once captured they have to be squashed.</p> <p>The larvae remain active all through the winter or until they are fully-grown. By April all will have dug their way into the soil to pupate, emerging in early summer. Because the beetles live a long time they can be found on the plants all the year round.</p> <p>The adults do not appear to eat much in summer but in August they start munching, mate and lay eggs.</p> <p>The good news is that, come the spring, when the larvae disappear into the ground, most chewed plants recover, throwing out new growth to replace their lost leaves. However, the beetles have no natural predators in this country and will soon re-emerge, so control will be needed. Since the beetles are slow, and just hang about on their food plants, the summer is the best chance to fight back. </p>",
  "<p>This time last year the world\u2019s weather was being dominated by one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o events on record. As surface waters in the equatorial Eastern Pacific warmed by more than 2\u00b0C, a chain reaction of extreme weather events was set in motion. From torrential rains in Peru and huge storms pounding the coast of California, to drought and bushfire in Australia and Indonesia and catastrophic floods in south-east India (submerging parts of Chennai under eight metres of water), this El Ni\u00f1o really packed some punch. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/30/el-nino-is-over-but-it-leaves-nearly-100-million-people-short-of-food\">May 2016 the El Ni\u00f1o conditions had gone</a>, but the big question now is whether El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s opposite phase \u2013 La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 is waiting in the wings?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/what-is-el-nino\">What is El Ni\u00f1o?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>La Ni\u00f1a, which is associated with abnormal cooling of equatorial Eastern Pacific waters, usually does follow El Ni\u00f1o, and in this case we\u2019d expect to see La Ni\u00f1a emerge by the end of this year or in early 2017. And like El Ni\u00f1o, <a href=\"http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/elnino/lanina-faq\">La Ni\u00f1a</a> also tends to whip up some weird weather, often bringing cooler temperatures to many regions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jul/14/east-africa-drought-la-nina\">drier conditions to East Africa</a> and wetter weather over south-east Asia.</p> <p>So far scientists have measured cooler than average sea surface temperatures in the Central Pacific, but this hasn\u2019t spread further, and right now most climate models are <a href=\"http://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/?enso_tab=enso-cpc_plume\">predicting a return to average conditions</a> for the Pacific, or at most a weak La Ni\u00f1a event. If La Ni\u00f1a does arrive then its cooling influence might cause a break in the string of global record-breaking warm months we\u2019ve seen since March 2015, but without La Ni\u00f1a the world\u2019s thermostat is <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/gpc-outlooks/glob-seas-prob\">likely to continue inching upwards</a>.</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/16/movingonfrommontreal\" title=\"\">Montreal protocol</a> is the most successful environmental treaty in history, and arguably one of the most successful of any international pact. It phased out the gases that were destroying the ozone layer, averting potential catastrophe and healing the hole that human activities had opened in our protective layer. Unfortunately, it had a side-effect overlooked when it was signed in the 1980s: some of the chemicals substituted for the ozone-destroyers had an effect on the climate thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide. This month, world governments agreed to address that by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\" title=\"\">eliminating the substitute chemicals</a> \u2013 called HFCs \u2013 potentially reducing rising temperatures by as much as 0.5C in a relatively short time. Scientists put the safe limit on future rises at 2C above pre-industrial levels by the middle of this century: beyond that, catastrophic and irreversible climate changes are judged likely. So the reduction agreed under the Montreal protocol could have an enormous, and swift, impact.</p> <p>This is just the beginning of the good news. The International Civil Aviation Organisation <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aviation-is-first-global-industry-to-limit-carbon-emissions/\" title=\"\">agreed this month to measures</a> to combat the impact of flying. Planes are not only a rising source of greenhouse gases, but also contribute through the vapour they produce, which \u2013 coming at such high altitudes \u2013 has a greater warming effect. This week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/shipping-progressives-call-for-industry-carbon-emission-cuts\" title=\"\">international shipping will debate similar rules to cut its impacts</a>. This is a trillion-dollar business, and ships use particularly dirty fuel. Governments should take the simple measures needed. Altering the fuel to be less polluting, preventing outflow during shipping&#xa0;and harbourage, and improving monitoring to reduce emissions need not be costly and will be invaluable in the fight against marine and air pollution as well as climate change.</p> <p>These progressive moves, though belated and insufficient, must be welcomed. They&#xa0;represent an unprecedented run of helpful measures set out internationally since&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\" title=\"\">the Paris accord on climate change was&#xa0;signed last December</a>. In further good news, the Paris accord itself has now been ratified, making it harder for future governments in any nation, and of any stripe, to unpick it. Supporters said Paris would unleash a slew of contributory measures that would help reverse the rising trend in greenhouse gases. Based on these conclusions, it looks as if they&#xa0;were right.</p> <p>Now the bad news. Last Tuesday, Nasa confirmed that September was the hottest on record, albeit by a small margin, making 11 out of the last 12 months record-breakers. This year is expected to set a new record \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/2015-smashes-record-for-hottest-year-final-figures-confirm\" title=\"\">as last year did</a>, and 2014 before it. These results give the lie to climate sceptics\u2019 claim that global warming has \u201cpaused\u201d.</p> <p>The biggest obstacle to action on climate remains, as it has been for more than 20 years, the US political system. The US has led the world on other environmental reforms, but the Senate is, incredibly, threatening to block the improvements to the Montreal protocol, apparently from partisan spite, industry lobbying and climate denialism rather than any rational basis. And if Donald Trump were to win the White House, though polls now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/trump-clinton-polls-brexit\" title=\"\">indicate that is unlikely</a>, all bets on action on global warming would be off. He has declared himself a climate change denier and vowed to renege on the Paris agreement.</p> <p>Scientists say we have a rapidly closing window to reorient the world\u2019s economies to a low-carbon future, just a few years before we are locked into dangerous levels of warming. In 1987, the Montreal protocol was agreed despite clamour from industry that phasing out these destructive gases would be technically impossible or economically catastrophic. Those voices were wrong: the change happened ahead of schedule, with no discernible economic effect. Multiple studies, not least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/27/nicholas-stern-climate-change-davos\" title=\"\">the landmark 2006 Stern review</a>, have shown that reducing greenhouse gases will have an economically beneficial effect. Industries such as coal can be compensated while others flourish, creating jobs and economic opportunity.</p> <p>To achieve what is needed before the window closes, we must recapture the sense of urgency that motivated the Montreal protocol. Then, a clear and imminent danger \u2013 based on only two decades of scientific research, compared with more than 100 years of global warming \u2013 led nations, even during the cold war, to come together to protect our planet. Climate change may be slow-burning compared with the ozone layer\u2019s destruction, but it is no less threatening. Montreal should provide the template by which we tackle it.</p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s decision to greenlight aviation expansion (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/chris-grayling-decision-heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-tuesday\">Chris Grayling: decision on airport expansion to be made on Tuesday</a>, theguardian.com, 23 October) is a predictable failure, but not an acceptable one. With the scrapping of vital decarbonisation policies and funding, the UK is already way off-track to meet our climate change commitments. The impacts of any new runway will be devastating to people\u2019s lives and to the planet. Locally it will see the demolition of hundreds of homes, result in increased noise pollution, and illegal levels of air pollution \u2013 already responsible for almost 10,000 premature deaths in London every year.</p> <p>But the biggest tragedy of the government\u2019s failure is a global one. Only around 5% of the world\u2019s population flies at all, yet the impacts of climate change \u2013 droughts, floods and heatwaves \u2013 are already hitting poorer communities in the global south, who are the least likely to ever set foot on a plane.</p> <p>The push for more runway space is not about demand from business \u2013 that has been dropping for over a decade. Nor is it about people taking one or two annual holidays. Growth is being driven by the frequent leisure flyers taking weekend breaks and shopping trips by plane. Half of the UK population don\u2019t fly in any given year, yet all of us subsidise the holidays of the rich.</p> <p>The UK must not abandon our commitments under the Paris agreement and the Climate Change Act for the convenience of binge flyers. We will not allow our government to ignore the promises they have made to us and to the world.</p> <p><strong>Craig Bennett </strong><em>CEO, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, </em><strong>Nicky Bull </strong><em>Chair, Operation Noah, </em><strong>Amy Cameron </strong><em>Director, 10:10, </em><strong>Sarah Clayton </strong><em>Coordinator, AirportWatch, </em><strong>Peter Deane </strong><em>Biofuelwatch, </em><strong>Bill Hemmings </strong><em>Director, aviation and shipping, European Federation for Transport and Environment, </em><strong>Claire James </strong><em>Campaigns coordinator, Campaign Against Climate Change, </em><strong>Rosalie James </strong><em>Chair, Aircraft Noise 3 Villages</em><strong> </strong><em>(Lightwater, Windlesham &amp; Bagshot), </em><strong>Tim Johnson </strong><em>Director, Aviation Environment Federation, </em><strong>James MacColl </strong><em>Head of campaigns, Campaign for Better Transport, </em><strong>Kara Moses </strong><em>Environment editor, Red Pepper, </em><strong>Leo Murray </strong><em>Director, Fellow Travellers, </em><strong>Danielle Paffard </strong><em>UK divestment campaigner, 350.org, </em><strong>John Sauven </strong><em>Executive director, Greenpeace UK, </em><strong>Kia Trainor </strong><em>Director, CPRE Sussex, </em><strong>Anna Vickerstaff </strong><em>Co-director, UK Youth Climate Coalition, </em><strong>Vivienne Westwood </strong><em>Climate Revolution, </em><strong>Peter Willan </strong><em>Chair, Richmond Heathrow Campaign</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Milton, director of external affairs at Heathrow, says the Airports Commission\u2019s analysis \u201cconcluded that a third runway at Heathrow can be delivered in accordance with EU air-quality limit law, and would have less impact on health receptors (where people live and work) than a runway at Gatwick would have on the community in that area\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/21/heathrow-expansion-will-boost-air-quality\">Letters</a>, 22 October).</p> <p>It made no such conclusion at all. Quite the opposite, in fact; the 2015 Business and Sustainability Assessment said of the Heathrow North West Runway that \u201cagainst the Commission\u2019s objective to improve air quality consistent with EU standards and local planning policy requirements the unmitigated impact of the Heathrow Northwest Runway scheme is SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSE. Mitigations as above could limit this impact to ADVERSE if delivered with concerted effort from all parties including HAL but given the increases in pollutant concentrations at various health receptors and despite the fact that EU and local policy limits are not necessarily breached, the impact is unlikely to be able to reach a NEUTRAL level.</p> <p>\u201cThe Heathrow Airport Northwest Runway scheme performs more poorly than Gatwick with respect to EU limit values as Gatwick has no monitoring stations predicted to be in breach of EU limit values, but more strongly than Heathrow Airport Extended Northern Runway\u201d.</p> <p>Since that was written, it has been verified that EU emissions limits around Heathrow are actually being breached now.</p> <p>Mr Milton and others may be of the view that Heathrow expansion will be the best thing ever for the economy with \u00a3211bn in economic benefits, although without any explanation I suspect that figure may be plucked out of the air. Benefits or not, one thing is for certain \u2013 Heathrow is poisoning the residents around it now and will do so more if expanded. The Cambridge study is not worth the paper that it is written on. It is theoretical and modelled, and it depends on compliance with the Euro 6 engine emissions limits. Tests have shown that while vehicles may comply in laboratory situations, they are failing by up to 1,500% when out on the road.<br><strong>Neil Spurrier</strong><br><em>Twickenham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Milton appears to be living in a parallel universe. Under current EU legislation, it is impossible to give the go-ahead for a third runway without an avalanche of legal challenges. Heathrow breaches the EU air quality directive for a number of pollutants, but nitrogen dioxide is the most intractable as local traffic and congestion is bound to increase in line with passenger numbers. The strategy being adopted by Heathrow management depends upon new diesel engines emitting less pollutants than current models, but this strategy is doomed to failure as recent studies demonstrate that even Euro 6 diesel engines emit much more NO<sub>2</sub> on the road than they do in lab testing.</p> <p>I suspect the reason that Theresa May has delayed a parliamentary vote on Heathrow (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may\">Report</a>, 19 October) is to give the UK parliament time to invoke article 50, and repeal the relevant EU air quality directive.

  "<p>Some years ago, a journalist went to interview Lord Michael and Lady Anne Heseltine about their garden. The woman in question was a poor choice for the job, Lady Heseltine thinks: \u201cI forget her name, but she is married to \u2026 Alan ... Oh, God, the little man who\u2019s slightly in disgrace now, but I imagine that\u2019s why she was given the job.\u201d (She means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob\">Alan Yentob</a> and his wife Philippa Walker, who, it should be said, has a long and serious list of documentary credits to her name.) \u201cShe didn\u2019t know anything about gardening at all, which was rather a pity, and she kept wanting to bring Michael back to politics. He said: \u2018No, this is the garden, not politics.\u2019 And she didn\u2019t want to talk to me at all.\u201d She laughs brightly, her message artfully transmitted. I run my hand over the list of questions about the state of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative party</a> and her husband\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/fightback-against-brexit-on-cards-remain-eu-referendum-heseltine\">forceful interventions in the Brexit debate</a> that I\u2019ve written down on my way here, smile back, and try to think of something intelligent to say about snowdrops.</p> <p>We\u2019re in a living room at Thenford, the family\u2019s grand Northamptonshire home and venue of the remarkable gardens and arboretum that are a large part of their life\u2019s work. Lord Heseltine isn\u2019t here yet. He\u2019s out there somewhere, I guess, lecturing an errant sapling, as he has acknowledged that he occasionally must, or taking issue with a squirrel. Who knows how long he\u2019ll be: being out in the garden at Thenford is not like being out in most gardens. \u201cBefore we had the golf buggies and mobile phones it was a nightmare,\u201d Lady Heseltine \u2013 can I call her Anne? I don\u2019t risk it \u2013 says. \u201cYou\u2019d spend half the morning looking for him.\u201d They would alert him from the bell tower, and Michael would occasionally return, a little breathless, only to find that the summons was not on behalf of No 10 but from someone offering to clean the windows.</p> <p>The estate runs to about 1,400 acres, and they\u2019ve reinvented it all. \u201cIt is completely barmy,\u201d Anne says. \u201cWe never meant to do it. We never meant to do it.\u201d At that moment, in the driveway visible through the window behind her, I see a rangy 83-year-old in corduroy trousers and purple socks, his luxuriant hair buffeted by the wind, whistling past in a golf buggy. It\u2019s Tarzan, with a hint of Fred Flintstone. An image arrives of a prehistoric political titan, mace in hand, doggedly propelling his stone-age vehicle onwards with his feet. Before Michael has even walked in, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019d rather be out there than in here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff3b30b165cfc2e6d3c4b86b8e4b2a8abeb88383\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3b30b165cfc2e6d3c4b86b8e4b2a8abeb88383/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It is completely barmy.

With the Tarzan-and-Jane era more or less behind them \u2013 while he was swinging that mace in the cabinet and carving out a niche as the best Conservative prime minister that never was, she was on the boards of four major museums \u2013 the Heseltines have finally written the book that they have talked about for years. So, OK, you win, Heseltines. Fine. We\u2019ll start with the garden.</p> <p><a href=\"http://headofzeus.com/books/thenford\">Thenford</a> is an account of a horticultural transformation from a neglected wilderness, where \u201cold trees remained where they had fallen, like sticks in a giant\u2019s game of spillikins\u201d, to great English gardens. It features useful advice, hearty family photos and the odd entertaining political anecdote, but mostly it\u2019s a monument to an undertaking that, whatever they were doing in London, you cannot help feeling was their real calling.</p> <p>When they came here in 1977, the Heseltines hadn\u2019t quite reckoned with the scale of the project. \u201cThe plan was the house rather than the garden, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d says Anne. \u201cWe were not looking for the garden,\u201d says Michael, who has sat down in an enormous armchair next to his wife, with an appealingly shabby 16-year-old sausage dog called Casper at his feet. \u201cThere was an assumption that there would be a garden already there. But we never thought we would find a broken down wood, which is what we got.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b6e510f04cfe19164543a1633396c72e46673ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b6e510f04cfe19164543a1633396c72e46673ef/0_0_3672_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Heseltines moving into their prior Nettlebed home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Heseltines moving into their prior Nettlebed home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe did it bit by bit,\u201d Anne goes on. \u201cUsually, we completed one section, and then we thought: what\u2019s next? We started with an aviary, then there was this little stream, and then we made some ponds \u2026\u201d On the list goes. They did once decide against building a bridge because of the expense, but that appears to be about the only economy, which is probably not that surprising when you consider that this year\u2019s Sunday Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rich-lists\">Rich List</a> estimated the fortune they have accumulated via Haymarket publishing at \u00a3300m. He swiped cuttings from the prime minister\u2019s country retreat, Chequers (Edward Heath visited, as did John Major, David Cameron, the American ambassador during the Westland affair, Prince Charles, and any number of other grandees; Margaret Thatcher never did), and she chose sculptures by Lynn Chadwick and Elisabeth Frink. A <a href=\"http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3982038\">massive bust of Lenin</a>, rescued from the former Soviet Union at the end of the cold war was meant to cost \u20ac2,000; when the dealer sheepishly explained that he had left a zero off the end of the price, they rolled their eyes and bought it anyway. The garden itself, meanwhile, is entirely their own. Today, there are about 13,000 varieties of plant catalogued here, among them 3,000 trees and shrubs in the arboretum, 400 different roses, 370 oaks and 342 snowdrops, which, I am almost certain, are those little white ones.</p> <p>The house and its owners have the same careless, unapologetic grandeur as the gardens. I don\u2019t mean to be crass, but Michael Heseltine\u2019s loo is an actual throne: a gigantic wooden chair with arms and a wicker seat that you have to lift to discover its true purpose. There are many beautiful things, as well as a bobblehead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush\">George W Bush</a>. The Heseltines, for their part, have a laconic, almost indetectable haughtiness to their excellent manners. There is, for example, no indication that they\u2019ve registered my name. I quite like them for it, to be honest. They are here to talk about the garden, which they love fiercely, and they are not that interested in discussing anything else \u2013 certainly not politics, as we have seen (although they will, after a slight hesitation, reveal the time that Michael punched a drunk in the face).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6522ff4f3af98faeecd5c74771677cd7a3099f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6522ff4f3af98faeecd5c74771677cd7a3099f6e/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"The \u00a320,000 bust of Lenin.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u00a320,000 bust of Lenin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pilston for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that\u2019s later. For now, they\u2019re describing the consequences of their great project\u2019s exposure to the world with some of the same reluctance. At the moment, they open the gardens to the public four times a year; with the book, Anne says: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen. I think we will have to be open more than four times a year, don\u2019t you? Otherwise the garden will be trampled to bits.\u201d At the thought, I surmise, of large family groups with screaming toddlers and a pram carving its way across the grass, a cloud crosses Michael\u2019s face. \u201cThe website is coming,\u201d he says ominously, sounding like the voiceover on a trailer for a horror film called The Website. \u201cWe can see how it goes.\u201d Yes, he admits, there is trepidation at the prospect. \u201cBeing open is a new dimension, and it starts with things called loos, and teas, and gates, and\u201d \u2013 he italicises his dismay \u2013 \u201c<em>choke points</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, even without such chaos, there are already some interlopers in paradise. One of the statistics that stuck with me from the book, I say, was that the Heseltines have shot a genocidal 300 grey squirrels for the protection of small birds and trees in just six months. Three hundred! It\u2019s a massacre out there. \u201cThree hundred and fifty,\u201d Michael corrects me. \u201cAbsolutely awful things,\u201d says Anne. Taken though I am with the image of Tarzan taking potshots from the golf buggy, I suspect it\u2019s probably mostly the work of Thenford\u2019s dozen gardeners. Still, Michael bows to no one in his antipathy for the little buggers. \u201cThese foreign intruders may have a Walt Disney appeal in London parks,\u201d he writes \u2013 the couple take alternating chapters \u2013 \u201cbut to us they are Public Enemy Number One \u2026 and are shot without hesitation.\u201d He is variously \u201cenraged\u201d and \u201caggravated\u201d by their presence. But now they are on the run and, as a result, says Anne, \u201cwe are hearing and seeing all sorts of birds that we didn\u2019t before.\u201d In such idyllic circumstances, the Heseltines are more enamoured of their garden than ever, and more determined to spend as much time there as they can. \u201cI can tell you exactly when I feel it most,\u201d Michael says, \u201con a cold January day when I\u2019m out shooting, and I say to myself: \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019 All those lovely greenhouses, and I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>If all this \u2013 anxiety at the influx of the great unwashed; shooting; that throne \u2013 give an impression of elitism, the Heseltines are bracingly unconcerned. It makes you nostalgic for a certain stripe of patrician Conservative, now in short supply, who viewed the sensible stewardship of the nation as their natural responsibility, and didn\u2019t much care if they seemed remote in exercising it. It would be harder to get away with on the front lines of politics now, wouldn\u2019t it? In the post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/23/mps-expenses-conservatives\">duck-island-era</a>, a life like this would come with a political price. Not a bit of it, says Michael. \u201cYou have just got to believe in what you are doing. Anyway, there is a huge gardening world out there. And I would much rather have them on my side than the journalists.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling embarrassed about my firm position in the latter camp, I talk ruefully about my own back garden, whose state of disrepair can be summarised by the ominous weed that keeps sliding in under the back door. \u201cThey are not toys,\u201d Michael says solemnly. \u201cThey are very demanding. Well, you can pave it.\u201d A thought occurs to him, and he looks a bit surprised. \u201cThere is something I want to clarify,\u201d he announces. \u201cAre you the gardening correspondent of the Guardian?\u201d No, I\u2019m not. \u201cOh,\u201d he replies. \u201cI thought you were.\u201d He sits back and narrows his eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2623419fdc48a11db3618c6969c8188a382aee38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2623419fdc48a11db3618c6969c8188a382aee38/0_273_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher with Michael Heseltine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher with Michael Heseltine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Daily Express/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I look back down at my notes about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>. Is it all right if I ask a couple of political questions? \u201cYou can try,\u201d he says. Now Anne, too, has a distinctly sceptical look; despite the tea and biscuits recently provided by a servant summoned by telephone, the atmosphere has chilled. Oh, well. I\u2019m trying to link the garden\u2019s impervious, permanent beauty to the state of chaos around the country when Michael cuts me off. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/fightback-against-brexit-on-cards-remain-eu-referendum-heseltine\">My views are quite well known</a> on the referendum,\u201d he says. (They are both firm remainers.) \u201cWe know what happened in the referendum. But no one knows what is going to happen as a consequence. We will see.\u201d</p> <p>He waits. Anne sips her tea. We\u2019re meeting the day after David Cameron\u2019s former spin doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">Craig Oliver\u2019s incendiary diaries</a> were splashed across the Mail on Sunday, revealing the bitter divides that the referendum created in the government, and putting the boot into Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson. What did Oliver\u2019s account tell us about the leaders of the leave campaign? \u201cThey did what they believed in, and the consequences will one day be evident,\u201d Michael says, and falls silent again. When he does elaborate, he moves with impressive efficiency into the weeds of policy. A question about the social effects of the division provokes a lively discussion of whether a friend called Susie was leave or remain but, otherwise, the subtext of every answer is clear: why is this question not about our garden?</p> <p>At this point, something slightly surprising happens. Accepting that the killer line about Boris that I had secretly hoped for is not about to materialise <strong>\u2013</strong> I mean, earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/lord-heseltine-slams-boris-johnson-abandoning-army\">Michael described his Henley constituency successor as</a> \u201ca general who marches his army to the sound of the guns and the moment he sees the battleground he abandons it\u201d, for God\u2019s sake \u2013 I find myself babbling out of awkwardness. I should, I hear myself saying, have asked the question a friend once advised me would get an interesting response out of anyone: have you ever thrown a punch? We all cheer up a bit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have, actually,\u201d says Michael, but Anne is on hand to correct him. \u201cYou did! You did!\u201d she cries. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? You were coming back from the House of Commons, and a man approached you. He was drunk or druggy or something.

Active though they still are, their richest life now is in the confines of Thenford, basking in the splendour of the blooming world they have made for themselves (and, just occasionally, for others).

  "<p>The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating a \u00a33.6m sale of shares to small investors in a company claiming to revive the Our Price records brand.</p> <p>Our Price was Britain\u2019s second-biggest chain of music stores in the mid-1980s, but after a series of owners, its last shop closed in 2004. The brand was acquired by Lee Skinner, who has attached it to short-lived businesses such as Our Price Furniture and Our Price TV.</p> <p>Investors have not lost money in the transaction, although the cash is being held in a third-party escrow account. The FCA is allowing Our Price to use limited funds, but large-scale spending is barred to protect shareholders.</p> <p>Early last year, Skinner sought to raise \u00a31.5m by offering shares to private investors in a new company, Our Price Records Ltd, at 60p a share, valuing the company at \u00a310.5m. After a second round of share sales, Our Price raised \u00a33.6m.<br></p> <p>Despite using the Our Price name and logo, the company was not seeking to tap into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/12/vinyl-destination-who-is-actually-buying-records\">the vinyl revival</a>. Instead, Skinner said he would use the well-known brand to become a force in online retailing, as a shop window for discounted goods from leading brands.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04792445/filing-history\">share prospectus said</a> the company would use the funds to launch its website and pay for advertising. It said the \u201cexit plan\u201d was to list on the stock market or sell to a trade buyer for \u00a3100m within three years. </p> <p>In late 2015, the FCA started examining the share sale and in January 2016, the regulator wrote to shareholders to say it was investigating. </p> <p>Skinner wrote to shareholders on 27 April saying Our Price\u2019s problems stemmed from its accountants, Leigh Carr, not being authorised to approve the prospectus. </p> <p>The FCA wrote to shareholders on 3 May saying Leigh Carr\u2019s lack of authority was \u201conly one facet of our investigation\u201d and that it was examining whether unauthorised sales agents breached company law, whether Our Price knew about any breaches, and the accuracy of promotional material sent to consumers.</p> <p>Skinner told the Guardian that he was ready to launch the business in January and the FCA investigation had prevented him from doing so.<br></p> <p>\u201cEverything as far as I\u2019m concerned has been done totally legitimately with the objective of a flotation or a trade sale within three years, once Our Price had rebuilt itself. That was always and still is the objective,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Leigh Carr did not respond to requests for comment. The FCA declined to comment. </p> <p>Our Price\u2019s prospectus said it would receive commission on discounted products offered through its website.

  "<p>Once the preserve of monastic retreats and hardcore meditators, simply being quiet is growing in appeal. Whole businesses have sprung up to meet a rising demand for quiet time, from silent weekend getaways to silent dining, silent reading parties and even silent dating. This month sees the release of documentary In Pursuit of Silence, a \u201cmeditative film\u201d about our relationship with noise, promoted with a delicate two-minute trailer in which not a word is uttered.</p> <p>Silence can, as the film attests, mean different things to different people. It can be a space for quiet reflection or a state fraught with discomfort. There is a certain intimacy inherent in being silent with other people \u2013 we usually do so only with those closest to us. So there is something almost radical about the recent trend for enjoying silence with strangers.</p> <p>Mariel Symeonidou started a regular silent reading party in Dundee just under a year ago, in a moment of \u201cuncharacteristic extroversion\u201d. Readers bring their books and meet in a bar, where they read together in silence for an hour or sometimes two, then put the books away to chat and have a drink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e0b51e9b369c78a434d467251ca4724fa9e7394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e0b51e9b369c78a434d467251ca4724fa9e7394/0_72_2953_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meditating in Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meditating in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concept began in the dimly lit, retro-furnished cafes and bars of Seattle. Devised as a literary hangout for those who don\u2019t like spoken-word nights or discussion groups, the premise was simple: show up, shut up and read. The trend has spread to New York and since found a home in the UK, in London and Edinburgh as well as Dundee.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the reading starts, everything goes quiet,\u201d says Symeonidou. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surreal, especially in what is usually a bustling bar. However, there is something special about sharing that silence with others. It offers an opportunity for escapism; everyone is so busy with work and with technology being ever present. An event like this gives people the opportunity to escape these things for a while.\u201d</p> <p>While the readings are now tranquil and relaxed, Mariel concedes initial iterations were a little awkward. This discomfort is precisely where the radical power of silence lies, says Matthew Adams, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Brighton. \u201cSilence is often something we experience as uncomfortable, as a rupture in the social fabric, an awkwardness we want to cover over with our voices.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/five-of-the-best-meditation-apps\">Five of the best meditation apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adams has a long-term interest in the social, cultural and psychological significance of silence, and particularly in shared silence and electing to share silence. \u201cCollective silence is about connecting with others in a way that gets underneath social conventions. It confronts us with what it feels like to be in the physical presence of other human beings without any games, strategies, reading or misreading of intentions. It is a temporary suspension of our reliance on talk.\u201d</p> <p>The absence of chatter can have social advantages. London\u2019s silent speed-dating event organisers Shhh! say that we are \u201cinstinctively better at communicating and choosing the right partners when we have the chance to put aside words and see each other as we really are\u201d.</p> <p>Shhh! hosts regular speed-dating sessions and singles events, featuring \u201cnon-verbal flirting games\u201d and \u201ceye-gazing\u201d; neatly side-stepping all the what-are-you-watching-on-Netflix questions. Claimed to be a favourite with \u201ccreative professionals in their 20s and 30s\u201d, Shhh! boasts a busy programme of events until the end of the year. The sessions begin with games to break the ice, including jumping around in front of a potential mate and making \u201cpaleolithic noises\u201d. Then comes a somewhat standard speed-dating set-up; attendees are paired off for a limited window of time, communicating only with gestures, before engaging in 60 seconds of uninterrupted eye contact. After the event you are dutifully furnished with the contact details of interested parties and if you\u2019re lucky enough to land a second date, you can maintain the established embargo on chit-chat, whisking them off for a silent dinner date or a mute trip to the pictures.</p> <p>Honi Ryan is an artist based in Berlin who began hosting silent dinners back in 2006. An otherwise ordinary dinner party setup, albeit with a ritzy vegan menu (regular dishes include baked almond soy mushrooms and Lebanese beans), the rules of the dinner are: no talking, no using your voice, no reading or writing, try to make as little noise as possible, do not interact with technology, and stay for at least two hours.</p> <p>Ryan describes the silent dinners as \u201csocial sculptures\u201d engaging with \u201cthe changing nature of communication and the space between people\u201d. So far she has taken her silent dining project to Mexico, the US, Australia, Lebanon and China. The global reach is fundamental to the project, as is the inclusive and international menu. \u201cIt\u2019s evident that the age-old connections we make over food do not depend on the words around it. \u201cSilence creates the space for the people and places involved to fill with whatever is needed; it strips away our rehearsed social behaviours.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bf91fad24ed1c552657eb508e03e13740cda95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bf91fad24ed1c552657eb508e03e13740cda95/56_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Pursuit of Silence \u2026 the art of finding stillness within yourself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Pursuit of Silence \u2026 the art of finding stillness within yourself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most well-known silent social is the silent retreat. Recently featured in an episode of BBC comedy Fleabag, silent retreats vary in tone and purpose, and are more popular than you might imagine. The retreats often have a religious or spiritual element, with Buddhist, Christian and Catholic retreats making up the majority. They can last anywhere between a couple of days to a few weeks, set in locations that are usually fittingly pastoral, in old farm buildings or country piles.</p> <p>Silent retreat regular Peter Cadney first discovered the power of silence on a 10-day vipassana silent meditation course, in 2013. The technique emphasises developing a connection with silence and accessing the \u201cstillness\u201d within yourself.</p> <p>\u201cThere had been a number of events in my life that I hadn\u2019t been able to deal with very well; things like relationship breakups and the death of a close friend. I\u2019d spent years working at a computer and was feeling the effects of muscle tension, anxiety and stress. I felt drawn to finding somewhere quiet to sit in order to find peace within myself.\u201d</p> <p>Cadney says silent meditation has helped to improve both his mental and physical health. \u201cWhen I first sat down in silence, it felt very peaceful. I started noticing just how many thoughts were coming and going in my mind, it was as if there had been no space for silence.\u201d</p> <p>Cadney has since given up his office job and now works as a holistic therapist. \u201cAs soon as I sat down in that meditation hall I thought: this is where I am supposed to be.\u201d</p> <p>Swiss Artist Salome Voegelin also found a purpose in silence. However, rather than finding silence soothing or nulling somehow, it instead opened her mind to the \u201cradical possibility of hearing\u201d. She describes silence, not as the absence of sound, but as the beginning of listening, though she has some reservations about the \u201cegotistical tendencies\u201d of the current trend for silent getaways.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these events are contemplative and respectful, I wonder how much of the silent listening is spent obsessing about one\u2019s own silence rather than hearing others and the environment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Voeglin\u2019s book, Listening to Noise and Silence: Towards a Philosophy of Sound Art posits silence and noise not as opposites but as different ends of the same spectrum. \u201cThere is no true silence. It\u2019s a state that allows me to hear my breathing in tandem with yours, the rumbling of my stomach, the gurgling of the radiator. It provides a time out. It\u2019s when we start to listen to each other.\u201d</p> <p>Silence assumes a new meaning in an era in which we are consuming information and engaging in conversation with each other endlessly, without ever opening our mouths. While we may watch The Pursuit of Silence and enjoy the absence of sound, how many of us will be tempted to check in with our emails, tweet our thoughts on the film? While we might find pleasure in those rare and cherished moments of peace and quiet, when it comes to silence and stillness, can we muster up the self-restraint at all?</p> <p><em>In Pursuit of Silence is on release now.</em></p>",
  "<p>I hold the burger with both hands and bring it, somewhat trepidatiously, to my mouth. I commit myself to at least one bite. As I close my eyes and chew, some long dormant receptor in my mind comes alive and for a split second it\u2019s 1986 again and I am eating a hamburger at a family cookout in Chicago.</p> <p>This is the first time I\u2019ve eaten meat in 30 years \u2013 except, this is not meat.</p> <p>I open my eyes and remember that I am standing in a wine bar in San Francisco\u2019s Soma neighborhood, surrounded by other reporters, all of us sampling our first Impossible Foods plant-based burger, which is making its West Coast debut. I\u2019m far from the only person convinced that this mixture of potato and wheat, coconut fat, Japanese yam, vegetable broth, xanthan gum, sugars and amino acids and a key protein called leghemoglobin is a dead ringer for the dead animal version of a hamburger. Three renowned chefs \u2013 Chris Cosentino, Traci Des Jardins and Tal Ronnen \u2013 are also convinced, and are here to announce that they are bringing the Impossible Burger to some of their respective eateries in California. (Chef David Chang became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/impossible-burger-new-york-veggie-momofuku-david-chang\">first in the country to serve it this summer at New York City\u2019s Momofuku Nishi</a>.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/impossible-burger-new-york-veggie-momofuku-david-chang\">Impossible burger: New York's latest food craze is a veggie burger that bleeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Impossible Foods is one of many companies that are inventing meat substitutes in an effort to disrupt animal agriculture and its significant environmental footprint. Unlike the veggie burger of yore, made from lentils or beans, Impossible Foods has developed a burger that can fool even meat connoisseurs.</p> <p>According to the company, the Impossible Burger uses 95% less land and 74% less water than a conventional burger. The greenhouse gas emissions generated in creating an Impossible Burger is 13% of that of a beef burger.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been reading about Impossible Foods for months and am fascinated by what its founder Pat Brown has accomplished since 2011. Brown, a long time vegan, left his dream job as a biochemistry professor at Stanford to start the company because he is so convinced that climate change cannot be mitigated unless the world cuts its reliance on animal agriculture. Brown considers animal agriculture, which accounts not just for livestock but all of the feed, land, water, transportation and energy needed to produce it, the single biggest threat to our climate. More importantly, he knew that the meat alternatives that existed at that time would never convince omnivorous diehards (like chef Cosentino, who equates most veggie burgers with hockey pucks but calls the Impossible Burger a \u201ccravable\u201d product) to give up the real thing.</p> <p>To have a shot at converting the masses, Brown knew his burger needed authenticity. Its texture needed to closely mimic the connective tissue of beef. But more importantly, it needed, quite literally, to bleed \u2013 or at least, emit a blood-like substance. To do that, it needed heme.</p> <p>Heme is the molecule in hemoglobin which carries oxygen in blood and also happens to make beef taste like beef. The good news is that the roots of soy or other legumes contain a protein called leghemoglobin that serves a similar role to that of hemoglobin in mammals (it pulls nitrogen or oxygen from the soil). The bad news is that harvesting that protein from legume roots by farming them would have been energy- and resource-intensive. So Brown and his team of scientists, engineers and chefs have figured out how to take, as journalist<a href=\"https://psmag.com/the-biography-of-a-plant-based-burger-31acbecb0dcc#.oeu2ln7kz\"> Rowan Jacobsen describes</a>, \u201cthe snippet of soy DNA that codes for heme and inserting it into a standard yeast strain\u201d.</p> <p>Impossible Foods then ferments that yeast to make heme, which is what makes the Impossible Burger bleed. It\u2019s what thrusted my taste buds back in time, convincing them that they were once again consuming the all-American food icon.</p> <p>Some people get freaked out by this notion that scientists can make fake blood. If I were a meat eater, I\u2019d be far more concerned with what comes with that bonafide cow heme. Consumer Reports recently <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/food/how-safe-is-your-ground-beef.htm\">analyzed raw meat in 300 store-bought burgers</a> (both from conventionally-raised grain-fed cattle and grass-fed cattle) and looked for fecal-derived bacteria. And there it was, in every single sample. Even putting aside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/21/eat-less-meat-vegetarianism-dangerous-global-warming\">environmental impact and ethical implications of the industrial meat complex</a>, do you want a fake burger with fake blood or a real burger with real poop?</p> <p>As I took my second and third bites, I started to wonder if eating this Impossible Burger would flip some long repressed caveman switch in my brain, making me crave meat again. But that didn\u2019t happen. In fact, eating such a convincing imposter just made me feel weird. Not guilty. Not nauseous. Just disconcerted. I asked Pat Brown if he had a similar reaction, and he said it was a bit like the experience of drinking out of a water fountain made from a toilet.</p> <p>That might sound insane, but it is an experience that he and I and millions of others who have visited San Francisco\u2019s Exploratorium museum have all had, because he was referring to an exhibit meant to explore human perception. The water is perfectly clean tap water, but the conveyance seems wrong. Likewise, eating something that is not meat but really seems like meat, seems wrong.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that in the near future, Impossible Foods will end up on the menu of a restaurant that I frequent, or on the shelves of my local grocer. I\u2019d eat it, but only if I did not see more compelling options.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2016/apr/06/foods-modified-startups-meat-gelatin-pictures\">Impossible foods: how startups are changing what we eat \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But who cares if I\u2019m ambivalent? It really doesn\u2019t matter what I, or Pat Brown, or any other consumer who has already eschewed meat, thinks about the Impossible Burger \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.vegetariantimes.com/article/vegetarianism-in-america\">because we make up just 3.2% of American eaters</a>. The eating habits of the 317 million other Americans is what Brown is targeting. To reach its mission \u2013 which venture capitalists have backed to the tune of more than $175m \u2013 Impossible Foods needs to convert not just a handful of gourmet chefs in coastal cities. </p> <p>It needs to convert the line cook at your favorite greasy spoon diner, and the food services company that sells to your office cafeteria, and eventually McDonald\u2019s, with its 36,538 outlets serving 68 million customers daily in 119 countries.</p> <p>I, for one, am bullish that the meat-eating public can be sold on the Impossible Burger. The endorsement of big name chefs carries a lot of weight in our food-obsessed culture, so if this trend continues and the Impossible Burger makes its way into more marquee menus, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it lands in the mainstream American diet. </p> <p>If it happened with kale, why can\u2019t it happen with a fake burger? Of course, unlike simply converting more land to growing a trendy leafy green, scaling production of the Impossible Burger \u2013 and getting it into grocery stores at a price point that the average consumer is willing to pay \u2013 is going to be a challenge. Even if that happens, Brown\u2019s mission will not be accomplished. Around half of the beef produced in the US is turned into ground chuck. So even if real meat burgers were to disappear, feedlots, other cuts of meat, and all of the environmental and ethical implications that come with them, may not.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a start. And even if Impossible Foods falls short, there are other startups busy at work in the lab, also focused on disrupting the industrialization of animals. As the global population swells towards the 10 billion by mid-century there simply are not many other options.</p>",
  "<p>Look out! The ultras are coming. Well, not quite. And definitely not those ones \u2013 although it depends on what your definition of an ultra is \u2013 but there are moves afoot in Britain to try to adopt a culture of support which often appears to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/oct/28/the-secret-footballer-mario-balotelli\" title=\"\">more misunderstood than Mario Balotelli</a>.</p> <p>Whenever stories about European ultras penetrate British media they invariably come dripping with negative connotations of the fans involved: extreme violence, racist chanting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/nov/01/petrolul-steaua-bucharest-romania-ultras\" title=\"\">threats against players</a> and other such depressing accounts that help portray these groups as a repugnant, often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/06/marseille-ultras-rule-temptation-never-far-away\" title=\"\">entitled, subculture within football</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/21/premier-league-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-claudio-bravo\">Premier League should learn from Pep Guardiola, not pour scorn on him | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, yes, it is clear ultras have an image problem. Very rarely do we hear the stories about the cuddly types, such as those who build links with different ethnic groups within their club\u2019s local community or the good work, such as that carried out by Bayern Munich fans, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/12/bayern-munich-anti-nazi-history\" title=\"\">in which they organise trips to Auschwitz</a> to highlight the club\u2019s Jewish history. But stories of do-goodery do not fit the stereotypical narrative of the ultra as the tooled-up smashing machine.</p> <p>But there are ultras already walking among us, Crystal Palace\u2019s Holmesdale Fanatics who, while not carrying the moniker ultras in their title (see above for why), are rightly praised for the noise and colour they bring to games. Their corner of Selhurst Park is an incessantly vibrant, effervescent antidote to the caravan-tradeshow atmosphere that is the norm for long periods of matches at many British stadiums, particularly in the Premier League. They also rally behind supporter issues brought about by the commercialisation of football.</p> <p>There have been attempts among followers of other British clubs to import a culture which at its heart is about intense organised backing of your team through colourful displays and noise on the terraces, not cracking skulls. Aston Villa\u2019s Brigada 1874, Leicester\u2019s Fosse Boys, Middlesbrough\u2019s Red Faction and Celtic\u2019s Green Brigade are among them and there have been movements at Ipswich Town and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/10/clapton-ultras-anti-fascist-essex-senior-league-football\" title=\"\">non-league clubs such as Clapton FC</a> and Dulwich Hamlet, whose support comes from a left-leaning, liberal platform as a counterpoint to the often contrary views on the terraces of British football\u2019s past.</p> <p>Kenny Legg, a football writer based in Berlin who is fascinated by German ultras, believes that for the UK to develop a similar scene fans need something to kick against, be it a political issue, exorbitant ticket prices or just the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/30/boredom-football-manchester-united-chelsea\" title=\"\">perceived boredom of the modern football experience</a>. \u201cIt has its roots in left-wing politics in Italy and the German ultras scene is heavily political, with groups often taking a stance on issues outside of football \u2013 refugees, racism, homophobia,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Germany the ultras movement was often a reaction against the hooliganism that was still prevalent in stadiums in the early/mid-90s. Ultras groups, in some instances, took over the terraces and made them a fun, bright, colourful place for broad ranges of society, rather than a place to be feared.\u201d</p> <p>But Legg believes that, even as Britain stands on the verge of shrinking itself culturally as it prepares to pull the shutters down on Europe, young people here could never be as politically motivated as mid-90s post-reunification Germans, so any catalyst must come from somewhere else. It may be that British football, particularly the commercial juggernaut that is the English top flight, is immune to an ultras movement because of all-seater stadiums, a fear of hooliganism, ticketing, an ageing fanbase (try doing the Poznan for 90 minutes in your mid-50s) and years of gentrification.</p> <p>David Mayor, a Manchester City season-ticket-holder of 30 years and writer for the sadly now defunct European Football Weekends website, fears the sanitisation of football in Britain \u2013 particularly the Premier League \u2013 has gone so far as to make developing an ultras scene almost impossible. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a warming to the movement in Britain because of the internet and YouTube and also people travelling abroad more to watch games. But fans here might be worried about the consequences of being too exuberant or vocally critical of their club. The possibility of being thrown out might put them off.\u201d</p> <p>Fans in Britain do not really enjoy orchestrated singing or repetition \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/20/england-fans-great-escape-supporters-band\" title=\"\">just ask the England band</a>. Nor do they take kindly to being told how to support their team. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/west-ham-watford-london-stadium-supporters-violence\" title=\"\">altercations that have broken out at West Ham</a> in recent months are evidence of a divide that exists between those who see themselves as old-school supporters and those who are new to the game and perhaps a little wealthier and more passive. And it is not only a problem at West Ham. Some fans just want to watch the match and could not care less about the atmosphere \u2013 and would want to be near a flare only if they were bobbing up and down in the North Sea. That is fair enough \u2013 and in any case many ultras do not believe in the no pyro, no party ethos. There are many other ways to have fun at the match.</p> <p>Legg says many normal fans were at first resistant to the ultras movement in Germany but, over time, grew to accept it and realise that it was a positive, harmless influence in grounds.</p> <p>With safe-standing back on the agenda (Celtic have reintroduced it), discussions about how to breathe a little life back into British stadiums will inevitably be had among fans\u2019 unions, of which there are many more than there used to be. If the word ultras is uttered, it need not be dismissed out of hand. Ultras groups might not be completely compatible with British football culture but they could help it get over what, at times, feels like a fear of atmosphere.</p>",
  "<p>Thursday will mark 30 years since the London Stock Exchange swept away centuries of tradition and beckoned in the modern, global City of London.

The big bang also meant the scrapping of fixed commissions on share dealing and of ancient distinctions between stockbrokers, who advised clients, and jobbers, who bought and sold shares on their behalf. </p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s government regarded the previous set-up as anti-competitive and inefficient and wanted the City to adopt new technology to compete as finance went global.</p> <p> \u201cIt was an anachronism that had had its day,\u201d said Nigel Boardman, a partner at the law firm Slaughter and May, who began working at his firm in the 70s and was a partner by the time the big bang arrived.</p> <p> The effect was to make many small City firms obsolete as the most prestigious were snapped up by US investment banks and rivals from Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere. The City boomed as London became a global financial centre, bridging the time zones of the Americas and Asia and allowing foreign banks access to the EU. This year it has even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/04/lse-shareholders-expected-to-back-deutsche-borse-merger-london-stock-exchange\">led to an attempt to merge the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a>.<br></p> <p>Job numbers rose. In early 1986, financial services employed 976,000 people in Britain, government figures show. By 1990 the number had jumped to 1.18 million and it peaked at 1.21 million in 2008. Today, even after the financial crisis and 30 years of automation and cost cuts, there are 1.15 million people employed in finance \u2013 174,000 more than before the big bang.</p> <p>Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture\u2019s global financial services business, said it also democratised share ownership \u2013 and brought in \u00a365bn of tax revenues. This was one of the benefits of the bonus culture that took over the City in the wake of the big bang.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit will change the City in some ways,\u201d said Lumb. \u201cBut I\u2019m more optimistic than pessmistic.\u201d He pointed to factors such as the skilled workforce in London and the tax and legal environment.</p> <p>The lobby group <a href=\"http://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2016/oct/Brexit_POV.PDF\">TheCityUK has calculated that \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 in which the UK does not have access to the single market of the remaining 27 EU countries \u2013 could put 35,000 jobs at risk.</p> <p>Boardman, though, sees some positives from leaving the EU \u2013 for instance, freeing the City from a tax on financial transactions that is being introduced in 10 European countries or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/04/bankers-bonus-cap-architect-says-sue-uk-government\">the cap on bonuses that has forced up City salaries</a>. \u201cOn the other hand, if financial passporting is lost that would be adverse \u2026 If you already have offices in the EU it may be you can more easily manage the loss of the passport \u2026 but if you don\u2019t it could be more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Previous anniversaries of the big bang have also coincided with controversies. In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/big-bang-1986-city-deregulation-boom-bust\">the 25-year milestone was marked by soul searching about the impact that the implosion of the banking sector</a> had had on the economy and inequality.</p> <p>But, Boardman said, the current controversy about financial services post-Brexit is about more than just London. \u201cThe future of the City is an extremely important thing for the country and I don\u2019t think we should talk about it as the future of the City. It\u2019s the future of the country to a very significant extent because the whole country benefits from the City\u2019s activities.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>That proverbial wall of worry?

Some are esoteric, like one tied to the options market and known as the \u201cskew\u201d. It rises in price along with the cost to buy options that will pay off when stocks fall, relative to the cost to purchase options that rise in price when stocks gain ground. That metric <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-12/docile-vix-masks-surging-prices-for-stock-hedges-before-election\">has hit record highs</a> this month. </p> <p> Add to that the perennial worries that stocks are overvalued \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-baml-survey-idUSL8N1BP2G6\">perhaps more so than they have been since the beginning of the 21st century</a>. The trailing price/earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 index is now about 24, meaning that investors are paying about $24 for every $1 of profits generated by the companies in the index in the last 12 months. </p> <p>The prospective P/E ratio, which is forward-looking, is about 18, meaning you would pay about $18 for every $1 of earnings. It\u2019s a quick and easy valuation metric that gives you a way to tell how important the market sees those earnings as being, and how hard it would be to get that income anywhere else. For context, the long-term average P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 index is about 15, so by that measure, you\u2019d have to say current valuations are above average. But are they excessive?</p> <p> Not if you\u2019re asking Richard Bernstein and his colleagues at Eaton Vance.</p> <p> True, those <a href=\"http://www.barrons.com/articles/punk-profit-growth-wont-kill-this-bull-market-1476508326\">profits have been more meager recently</a>, raising questions about whether lackluster growth in earnings was enough to fuel even modest expansion in share prices.</p> <p> But that ignores two facts. The first is that the profits recession <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/10/the-profit-recession-on-wall-street-is-coming-to-an-end.html\">may be drawing to a close</a>. The second is interest rates, which remain near historic lows. The market seemed fine with lofty valuations when the interest rate on the 10-year Treasury note was at 6.5%. Today, with the 10-year Treasury trading at only 1.7%,<strong> </strong>investors shouldn\u2019t find those market multiples terribly unnerving<strong>. </strong>When investors can get such meager returns from bonds, stock-market returns become much more valuable and it makes sense to be willing to tolerate higher valuations.</p> <p> Meanwhile, investors refuse to take on higher levels of risk.</p> <p> \u201cFind me an investor who is [borrowing] to get more exposure to equities,\u201d Bernstein said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/us-money-blog/2016/jun/26/us-stock-market-reaction-uk-leave-vote-brexit\">US stock market and Brexit: a toxic blend of uncertainty and complacency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact is, he says, that while investors may grumble about volatility and lackluster returns \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 is ahead only 4.8% so far this year \u2013 their logic is flawed. </p> <p>\u201cWith volatility comes opportunity,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually in the second-largest bull market of the postwar period and the opportunity cost of being fearful is high.\u201d </p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s time to climb the wall of worry. Or, to translate that old investment cliche, to take all your extra cash and invest it. Bonds certainly aren\u2019t going to generate much income and sitting on cash isn\u2019t remotely useful if you want to retire with a nest egg that has grown in size. </p> <p>You shouldn\u2019t ever allow yourself to be distracted by short-term events, however major they appear at the moment. Remember the Iraq war(s)? The terrorist attacks of 9/11? Even the financial crisis of 2008? Eventually, after all of them, the market snapped back to life and investors with a long-term time horizon didn\u2019t have to try to make the tricky or even impossible decision of when to jump back in after fleeing in terror. </p> <p> That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019ll want to buy everything in the market, the Eaton Vance pundits argued. Instead, it\u2019s time to become a little more picky. </p> <p>If the stock market itself isn\u2019t overvalued, some corners are, such as consumer staples (think packaged foods): you\u2019ll pay $19 to $20 for every dollar of earnings they produce and their earnings aren\u2019t growing very rapidly, noted Perkin. He also noted that there has been a rotation away from defensive stocks, like utilities, and that investors will need to start taking a look at cyclical companies.</p> <p> It may even be time to revisit gold mining companies, Bernstein suggested, companies that have performed so badly in the last few years that they have fallen off most investors\u2019 radar screens completely. Now they are <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/13851452/1/here-s-what-to-know-before-trading-volatile-gold-stocks.html\">starting to revive</a>.</p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re heading into a new market stage: the recovery phase of the profits recession,\u201d he says. </p> <p> Election or not, this is no time to be running for cover, he insists.</p>",

A person who once listened to Radiohead\u2019s first album, didn\u2019t like it and decided the rest of their output over the subsequent 24 years was rubbish. This person saw Alien 3 and to this day thinks David Fincher can\u2019t direct. They once saw a production of Hamlet where the stage lights went out and they still tell all and sundry down the pub that Shakespeare was a hack. This person watched the Tracey Ullman show in 1987 and is still convinced The Simpsons won\u2019t be a hit.</p> <p><strong>This distant and far off land </strong>is a comments section somewhere. This person is an idiot. And this person still thinks Ben Stokes doesn\u2019t justify a place ahead of Nick Compton in the England Test team.</p> <p><strong>If any questions remained over Stokes before this Test </strong>he has put them to rest as firmly as a dastardly villain might do your favourite character in Game of Thrones. Were his first-innings figures of four for 26 not enough to satisfy Mr Below the Line then his masterful harnessing of reverse swing to claim three for eight \u2013 <em>three for bloody eight! </em>\u2013 and ensure that Bangladesh\u2019s tail damn well would not wag must have at least kept the troll quiet for the rest of the series. </p> <p><strong>Then, just to make sure,</strong> he came in with his side 48 for four and departed 85 runs later with England 242 runs ahead \u2013 extended to 273 by the close \u2013 and surely set to win this match. The only questions now are 1) whether it\u2019s still cool to love Ben Stokes, given everyone worth knowing surely does after that double rescue act, and 2) is there a better all-rounder in Test cricket now, if we consider Ravi Ashwin a pure bowler?</p> <p><strong>Bangladesh have a bit of a conundrum on their hands. </strong>They are in the curious situation whereby the sooner they bowl England out, the quicker they are likely to lose this one. Alastair Cook obviously won\u2019t declare overnight but any ball blocked by the last two wickets is a ball wasted on this pitch. I expect Tim de Lisle will be OBOing the <em>coup de grace</em> at some point in the second half of the day.</p> <p><strong>Play begins at 10am Chittagong time, </strong>which is a delightful 5AM BST AND I\u2019M IN THE SODDING OFFICE.

  "<p>At the intersection of two highways just outside downtown Detroit, a hulking relic of the city\u2019s past looms over the skyline: the largest municipal trash incinerator in the US. It\u2019s a facility that has raised concerns of nearby residents since its construction in the 1980s.</p> <p>And some days, it stinks.</p> <p>\u201cThe odors, if you ride I-94, you get this foul, rotten egg smell,\u201d said Sandra Turner-Handy, who lives about three miles from the facility.</p> <p>The 59-year-old said her son used to work a block away from the incinerator and said the smell was \u201cconstant\u201d. Her granddaughter developed asthma while attending a school near the incinerator, but hasn\u2019t used an inhaler since she graduated and moved away.</p> <p>The persistent odor and emission of other polluting substances are among 40 alleged Clean Air Act and state violations that have been logged against the company that owns the facility, Detroit Renewable Energy, since March 2015, according to a notice to sue by the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72bc29f492666c57f9af3b12f952a282d1aa1c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72bc29f492666c57f9af3b12f952a282d1aa1c91/0_126_1944_2430/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Turner-Handy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Turner-Handy: \u2018You get this foul, rotten egg smell.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Michigan Environmental Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the things that you can\u2019t smell that are the most harmful,\u201d said Turner-Handy. \u201cAnd how do residents report something that they can\u2019t smell?\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, the incinerator burned more than 650,000 tons of garbage, according to the notice. And since the beginning of that year, the incinerator has been fined for persistently violating an earlier agreement with the state for alleged state violations.</p> <p>The law center also said in the filing that the incinerator presents a clear example of an environmental justice problem, as a majority of the trash burnt at the facility is imported from outlying communities, which pay $10 a ton less than Detroit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/14/green-waste-distribution-methods-recycling-plastic-oil-epa\">dispose of garbage</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/14/green-waste-distribution-methods-recycling-plastic-oil-epa\">Can incineration and landfills save us from the recycling crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn short, Detroit is subsidizing other communities throughout the State of Michigan, the Midwest, and Canada to dispose of its garbage at the Incinerator,\u201d the filing said, with the incinerator \u201clocated in a neighborhood that is composed mostly of low-income people of color and is heavily overburdened by air pollution\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a long-running debate over whether incineration is better for the environment than landfills. But communities located near incinerators have long lamented that they bear the brunt of its adverse impacts on air quality.</p> <p>Citing statistics from the EPA, the center said 7,280 residents live within one mile of the incinerator, of whom 60% live below the federal poverty line and 87% are people of color. An EPA report also found that the area is a \u201chotspot for respiratory related health impacts when compared to other Michigan communities\u201d, according to the law center.</p> <p>The notice to sue also names Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, along with the state and federal environment agencies. The agencies have 60 days to commence an enforcement action, the law center said, and if neither pursues any, a lawsuit may be filed on behalf of residents to enforce the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>Detroit Renewable Energy, which <a href=\"http://www.detroitrenewablepower.com/about/\">says</a> the facility provides energy to more than 140 buildings in the downtown and midtown neighborhoods, downplayed the litany of claims in the notice of intent.</p> <p>In a statement, the company said that it has invested approximately $6m over the last few years to \u201cimprove odor management\u201d at the facility. The company said it employs nearly 300 residents, operates a \u201csophisticated\u201d waste-to-energy facility, and \u201cplaces the highest priority on complying with the strict and complex requirements established by the EPA and the state environmental department.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, we have done our part,\u201d the company said. \u201cAny claim to the contrary would simply be false.\u201d</p> <p>The law center says otherwise.</p> <p>Beyond odor, the notice of intent to sue also highlights an additional 19 violations for emitting carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter above legal thresholds. The incinerator creates a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of particulate matter, said Nick Schroeck, executive director of the center, which \u201ccan get lodged in people\u2019s lungs\u201d.</p> <p>The incinerator can\u2019t be directly linked to cases of asthma, but the filing said <br>\u201cparticulate matter emissions have been shown to trigger asthma incidents, particularly amongst children\u201d.</p> <p>Activists are pushing for a ballot initiative for November 2017 to close down the facility in favor of cleaner-energy-producing methods.</p> <p>\u201cWe initially approached this topic sort of by looking at what it was we could do that would be effective within the confines of city law, of state law, and how a ballot initiative could actually rectify a problem in the city,\u201d said Mac Farr, treasurer and spokesman for <a href=\"http://sustainabledetroit.co/\">Sustainable Detroit</a>. \u201cAnd we could take a policy change and use it to both unify the city and also make the lives of Detroiters better.

He suggested a more \u201crobust, citywide recycling program\u201d could \u201cdivert a lot of material out of the waste stream if we were to shut off incineration as a method of disposal\u201d.</p> <p>Officials estimated earlier this year that <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/02/11/detroit-recycling-outreach-campaign/80254664/\">only 11% of households</a> in the city are recycling.</p> <p>Dr Abdul El-Sayed, executive director and health officer at the Detroit health department, said issues surrounding the incinerator hadn\u2019t been on his department\u2019s radar until recently, but it\u2019s now \u201cvery squarely on my plate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious that when you burn anything, it\u2019s going to produce material that goes up into the air. That material can do a number of hazardous things,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that those things are not good for the lungs, and the eyes and some of the other organs \u2026 the heart.

These days it\u2019s all <em>Bake Off</em>, Trump, Isis and <em>Poldark</em>.</p> <p>It must still be happening, because if it had stopped we would <em>definitely</em> have heard \u2013 you don\u2019t hear much about Sean Connery, but it\u2019ll be all over the news when he dies. A sudden halt in global warming would be an unmissable opportunity for climate change deniers to crow, for dark-souled petrol salesmen to denounce the scientific community as a bunch of delusional tree-huggers, for the scum of the earth to lay into the Friends of the Earth. So, I think it\u2019s safe to say climate change is still happening and the world\u2019s scientists aren\u2019t facing the spectre of being wrong instead of the more familiar spectre of being doomed. What a relief.</p> <p>As I understand it, then, the situation remains that human activities, particularly those that emit carbon dioxide, are elevating the planet\u2019s temperature in a way that, if unchecked, and maybe anyway, will render most of it uninhabitable by humans. That\u2019s still on the cards. Suddenly I\u2019m feeling a lot more relaxed about Brexit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm not a very environmentally friendly person. I'd much rather turn a tree into a chair or a pizza box</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But is it really, definitely happening? Well, again, as I understand it, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it is. Manmade climate change is as certain as anything can be. Of course, there are people who say it isn\u2019t, who have fuelled much discussion (fuel is often their business), but then there are people who will deny the hands in front of their faces: there\u2019s a school of maverick historians that claims the years AD614 to AD911 never occurred; there are people who think Elvis or Hitler still live, or that they live with each other, or that they recently split up after a row about Jeremy Corbyn. There is no assertion, no matter how self-evident, that is completely safe from contradiction. If humans are to survive, it is imperative that \u201cIs climate change a myth?\u201d move from the same discussion category as \u201cShould we introduce proportional representation?\u201d to the same one as \u201cIs the Queen a lizard?\u201d</p> <p>What brought all these Christopher Eccleston-era reflections to mind was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/theresa-may-accused-of-dither-and-delay-over-heathrow-airports-expansion\">Theresa May\u2019s announcement</a> last week about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport\">Heathrow</a> airport \u2013 or rather her announcement last week that she\u2019s going to make an announcement next week. It\u2019s all incredibly involved and tedious: next week the government will finally say, after decades of dithering, whether Heathrow will get another runway, or a longer runway, or whether, instead, Gatwick will get another runway. But it isn\u2019t really finally, because under a \u201cspecial derogation\u201d, ministers who are pissed off with the choice (because, say, their constituencies are near Heathrow) will be allowed to openly moan about it and then it\u2019ll probably be 2018 before MPs vote on the issue, in order to allow lots of time for a public debate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c215a9044341f9ad2f8e80bb2247b24dc26f844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c215a9044341f9ad2f8e80bb2247b24dc26f844/0_0_1884_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of aeroplane wearing a gas mask.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the nature of this debate that frightens me.

For Labour, London mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-gatwick-bosses-new-runway-heathrow\">Sadiq Khan opposes it</a> too and favours a new Gatwick runway. But all of this mainstream opposition seems to focus on the air and noise pollution (previously known as pollution and noise) it would cause in west London \u2013 hence the preference for the more rural Gatwick. Only the Greens and Lib Dems have even floated the notion of not extending an airport at all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/decision-airport-expansion-tuesday-chris-grayling-heathrow-gatwick-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58z4q\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2832299\"            data-video-name=\"Decision on airport expansion to be made on Tuesday, says Grayling \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580ca3b7e4b0d7abfb253e2d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979170&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/23/161023GraylingMarr_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979170&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/decision-airport-expansion-tuesday-chris-grayling-heathrow-gatwick-video\">Decision on airport expansion to be made on Tuesday, says Grayling</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is bonkers. Climate change is definitely happening. Aviation contributes hugely to it. So global levels of aviation must be significantly reduced. Why is it, then, that everyone with a whisker of a chance of power agrees that London\u2019s airport capacity should increase? It\u2019s not one side saying \u201cLet\u2019s close an airport\u201d and the other saying \u201cLet\u2019s not\u201d \u2013 that would be a reasonable spread of opinion when the need to reduce air travel was accepted. Instead, it\u2019s both sides saying \u201cLet\u2019s hugely extend an airport\u201d. The only debate we\u2019re having is over which one.</p> <p>You may not believe this, but I am not a very environmentally friendly person. I would much rather turn a tree into a chair, a pizza box and a roaring fire than hug it. I don\u2019t much care about endangered species. For me, the environment, the delicate global ecosystem, is somewhere for humans to live. It\u2019s collectively ours and I think we can do what we like with it. But it\u2019s got to remain livable in and livable from. That\u2019s not leftwing, it\u2019s just obvious. And I can\u2019t believe all those scientists are lying, much as I would genuinely like to.</p> <p>In this crisis, we\u2019re suffering a potentially disastrous failure of leadership. Would Theresa May deny climate change? I doubt it. Would Sadiq Khan? No way. So why on earth, specifically on earth, do they want to extend an airport? For the sake of London\u2019s economy. Well, excuse the cliche, but you can\u2019t take it with you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/climate-change-airport-expansion-heathrow\">Climate change means no airport expansion \u2013 at Heathrow or anywhere | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know I\u2019m ignoring the political realities and the importance of seeming pro-business, but isn\u2019t actual, physical reality a political reality too? Isn\u2019t the habitability of the planet good for business? But politicians aren\u2019t making these arguments. Instead, they\u2019re acquiescing in a situation where there\u2019s no overlap between the politically possible and the environmentally uncatastrophic.</p> <p>It may be too late. In which case, hey, build the runway. We might as well die prosperous. If we despair of reducing our environmental impact, if we\u2019re convinced the international agreements don\u2019t go far enough and won\u2019t be observed anyway, then let\u2019s extend away. Maybe the anti-climate change lobby is going to switch to that argument \u2013 from \u201cIt\u2019s not happening, so we don\u2019t need to change our ways\u201d to \u201cYeah, our bad, it was always happening, but it\u2019s unstoppable now, so there\u2019s no point in changing our ways\u201d. It\u2019s a logical approach, but, if accurate, it makes me feel a bit of a heel for fathering a child.</p> <p>There is a ray of hope. We will undoubtedly spend billions extending one airport or another but, on Britain\u2019s current form, that probably means global air travel actually will be reduced after all. Heathrow could be the reverse <em>Field of Dreams</em>: build it and they won\u2019t come. We can use sod\u2019s law to save the world.</p>",
  "<p>In the late 1660s, after the Great Fire, building began on land then known to Londoners as Henry VIII\u2019s Royal Park. It used to be fields around there, save for a few cottages. The area was primed to be one of London\u2019s grandest neighbourhoods, one of its future Marylebones or Mayfairs. A few decades later, the Huguenots arrived and built a church. Italians, Greeks and Algerians followed, setting up small businesses, cafes and restaurants. Then came the small theatres and the music halls, the poets and the performers, the prostitutes and the pop stars.</p> <p>\u201cSoho was this mythical place where anything went on, that collected outsiders, full of people that didn\u2019t really fit in anywhere else.\u201d On a muggy autumn afternoon at the private members\u2019 club Soho House, Marc Almond, here to discuss his new 10-album career retrospective box set, is describing the place that made him who he was in the late 20th century. \u201cA friend of mine, a ballet dancer, lived here in the late 70s, opposite a casino, and there were neons in the windows and the police coming every night arresting people. And I thought: this is where I want to be. This is where I\u2019m meant to be.\u201d</p> <p>But what Almond really loved about Soho went a little deeper. \u201cThe love of history next to the glass buildings, the little music hall next to the apartment block.\u201d He smiles, a little sadly. \u201cThe old and the new.\u201d It was here, on Brewer Street, that the kohl-eyed creature in front of me bought his first London flat 35 years ago, after having his first No 1 single as half of the duo Soft Cell. A fabulous update of a northern soul staple through the medium of synth-pop, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZVpR3Pk-r8\">Tainted Love</a> had a grittiness and a grottiness about it; it was waywardly glamorous. At its heart was that voice \u2013 deep, menacing, glorious, slightly out of tune, and unmistakably English.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gay men now have to be chiselled and have a bit of Botox \u2013 where does the outsider fit in?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the song Almond is best known for, a little to his chagrin, but it speaks volumes about his career, documented in the fabulously titled box set <em>Trials of Eyeliner</em>. Ten CDs is a lot, but its vastness stands up, telling us the tale of a musician who has never stood still. Cassette-only experiments with industrial group Coil sit next to lush smash hits, including Something\u2019s Gotten Hold of My Heart, Almond\u2019s duet with its original singer Gene Pitney (the pull of which was so strong in January 1989 that it knocked Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan\u2019s Especially For You off the top of the charts, and stayed there for a month). Operatic song cycles for the stage sit alongside singles about rent boys (1985\u2019s Stories of Johnny was performed live on <em>Wogan</em> with a children\u2019s choir). Other collaborators include Nico (Almond recorded Your Kisses Burn with her shortly before she died in 1988; a picture exists of the two of them playing pool), house DJ T-Total and Saint Etienne\u2019s Sarah Cracknell.</p> <p>Almond arrives shyly today with his young female PA, not wanting to be in the hubbub of noise surrounding London Fashion Week, which is circling upstairs. He\u2019s not one for phone interviews, which he says make him nervous; he prefers Skype, or speaking face to face. He is good at it too, warm and funny despite obvious anxiety; and his perfectly made-up face looks far from that of a man who will turn 60 next summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/17/london-soho-stories-sex-drugs-rock-and-roll\">Soho stories: celebrating six decades of sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Looking back at his career, however, he is wary of nostalgia. \u201cIt\u2019s a great comfort blanket sometimes, as long as you don\u2019t become totally nostalgic about everything\u2026 being that old person sitting there saying: \u2018Oh, it was better in this day and that day, now it\u2019s no good any more.\u2019\u201d Still, he has inevitably been taken back to his roots with this project, to the young boy from the north-west who went to Leeds Polytechnic to study art, but spent all his holidays in London, working on experimental theatre pieces about the city. \u201cI felt I could disappear here, or appear or disappear, however I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>Almond\u2019s story, like those of many artists who became famous in the 70s and 80s, follows a familiar pattern. Difficult childhood, pseudo-spiritual conversion through pop music, fully funded creative years at university, giro cheques and crap jobs, managers taking a risk \u2013 and ta-dah! No 1. \u201cBack then, record companies [were run by] mavericks. When you had a flop record, you weren\u2019t just put in the dumpster. You were nurtured, and allowed to make another record and another record because people believed in you. Now people are allowed one successful album, then [if the next fails] they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p> <p>Born Peter Mark Sinclair Almond in 1957 to a Scottish father and a Norwegian mother, he was brought up, on and off, by his maternal grandparents in Southport. His father, a soldier, told his son he had been a mistake and once tried to suffocate him with a pillow; his mother frequently laid a hand on him (when his parents divorced when he was 15, he and his younger sister, Julia, were \u201cdelighted\u201d). Almond was often ill with asthma and bronchitis and had issues at school arising from (he now understands) dyslexia and mild autism. But he has fond childhood memories too \u2013 of his grandfather carrying him on his shoulders on Southport beach, singing Stranger in Paradise from the Broadway musical <em>Kismet</em>. His grandmother, too, was a positive influence. \u201cShe always had her hairstyle like the Queen\u2019s, and she taught us to speak properly.\u201d Almond\u2019s soft vowels are testament to her. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what kind of shock she had seeing me on <em>Top of the Pops</em>, though,\u201d he laughs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would never have got through an X Factor audition. I\u2019d be one of the quirky ones they\u2019d stick in as a novelty act</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Almond\u2019s obsession with music began around the same time he realised he liked boys. Deep Purple and Black Sabbath were his passions at 13, before glam rock glittered into his life as his adolescence surged. He is Marc because of Bolan, and wears a purple and gold T Rex T-shirt under his jacket today; he also adored Bowie, seeing him on his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane tours. \u201cHe was so much more important to me than my teachers. He got me into books, music, films \u2013 that\u2019s what great pop stars can do.\u201d Then came punk, he continues, enthusiastically. \u201cAnd Soft Cell came from punk. Punk made me realise that I didn\u2019t need to be brilliant at playing instruments or making art \u2013 I could just create. It was about free expression.\u201d</p> <p>For Almond, this manifested itself in performance pieces he\u2019d do while studying art at Leeds Polytechnic. Take one called Icebox, in which he would sit at a mirror, naked except for black boots and a strategically placed swastika, shaving his hair then cutting himself, and simulating sex. Rather less dramatically, he became friends with a \u201ctall, stocky bloke from Blackpool who liked painting\u201d \u2013 one Dave Ball, who would mess around at the art department\u2019s tiny music studio on a Korg synthesiser. Serendipitously, Ball needed a singer to give shape to the spines of some songs, and Soft Cell\u2019s stark, gothic first track, The Girl with the Patent Leather Face was recorded in the art department studio. Still startling today, it shows how cheap machines could help musicians with little money make gripping music, as did the duo\u2019s next track, Memorabilia, which sounds like cutting-edge techno long before it was officially invented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1530acaf390979c9d4ada0a54ae54dca3e98e4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1530acaf390979c9d4ada0a54ae54dca3e98e4b/0_63_4542_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Almond with Dave Ball in November 1981, when Bedsitter went to No 4 in the charts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almond with Dave Ball in November 1981, when Bedsitter went to No 4 in the charts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fin Costello/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By summer 1981, Soft Cell had a record deal. Itching to be different from all the other icy synth-poppers, they decided to cover Tainted Love, which became 1981\u2019s biggest single (1.27m copies sold to date, though Almond didn\u2019t make a penny from the sales as the B-side was also a cover). He seems particularly pleased, nevertheless, that it kept Shakin\u2019 Stevens\u2019s Green Door off the No 1 spot. \u201cI don\u2019t think Shaky was very happy with me about that.\u201d</p> <p>Almond\u2019s obvious otherness was intriguing to many, but threatening to others, including his publicists, who weren\u2019t happy with how outre he was. They invented relationships he\u2019d had with women (including Liv Tyler\u2019s mother, Bebe Buell) to sell to the papers, and kept asking Almond to tone his outfits down, but he point-blank refused. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, Soft Cell would be finished, I kept getting told.\u201d Watch Soft Cell playing Bedsitter on <em>Top of the Pops</em> four months later, you see how Almond reacted: he\u2019s a riot of S&amp;M-friendly black leather. Two weeks later, their debut album <em>Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret</em> came out. It featured songs called Seedy Films and Sex Dwarf.</p> <p>Being a gay artist back then was tough, Almond says, and although things are better now, they\u2019re not as good as they should be. \u201cThe less mainstream press are a lot more accepting, but in other areas there\u2019s still a tendency to accept the gay stereotype \u2013 I call it the gay clown \u2013 who\u2019s prepared to do a gay performance for straight people, and that bothers me.\u201d He rails at <em>The</em> <em>X</em> <em>Factor\u2019</em>s treatment of gay contestants particularly. \u201cThere\u2019s this homophobic side to it \u2013 they pick a gay person who\u2019s going to be super-super-camp. What they\u2019re saying is \u2018Let\u2019s just have a bit of a laugh at them\u2019, really.\u201d He is visibly riled. \u201cI would never have got through these auditions. I\u2019d be one of the quirky ones they\u2019d stick in as a novelty act.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cacceptable face of gayness\u201d in general culture gets him bristling too. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be good looking, chiselled, have a bit of Botox, and wear a designer outfit to be accepted \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to be married, preferably. Where does the loner outsider in Castleford fit into all that? In the north, camp is still a weapon and a survival mechanism, but it\u2019s still derided. At least the gay community was more unified back then. Parts of the gay community are not valued as much as other parts in 2016\u2026 It\u2019s very divided these days.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I caught sight of myself on TV last year, and thought, \u2018Oh dear, I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can do this\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the 80s wound on, Almond\u2019s career went leftfield. An offshoot project, Marc and the Mambas, mixed chanson, vaudeville and goth, while Soft Cell committed \u201ccommercial suicide\u201d with 1983\u2019s <em>The Art of Falling Apart</em> and 1984\u2019s <em>This Last Night in Sodom</em>. Almond loved it. \u201cInstead of posing in party hats on the front of <em>Smash Hits</em>, we were being written about in serious music papers, which was great.\u201d Then they split up; not acrimoniously, but because Ball didn\u2019t want to tour and Almond did (they re-formed for a while at the turn of the century, and still remain friends).</p> <p>Almond also became friends with Nick Cave around then, and both were part of the Immaculate Consumptive, a one-off collective led by Lydia Lunch, which played just three gigs, in October 1983. Drugs were everywhere. \u201cIt was a cabaret show of the lost and the miserable. It was a great, wild time.\u201d Almond has been \u201cin awe\u201d of Cave as an artist ever since, but they\u2019ve long drifted apart. \u201cHe once sent me a book, quite a lot of years ago now, inscribed with the words, \u2018From your long-lost friend\u2019, and I didn\u2019t do anything about it. And I sometimes see him at awards ceremonies, but I\u2019m actually too shy to speak to him.\u201d</p> <p>The 1990s brought more success, including a fabulous No 4 cover of David McWilliams\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qdAkazLBs\">The Days of Pearly Spencer</a>. But drugs had taken their toll, and he gave them up completely by the late 1990s, save for a final binge on Millennium Eve. \u201cI felt it was an end of days, just like Prince said \u2013 you\u2019ve got to party like it\u2019s 1999 \u2013 so I started the millennium just how I didn\u2019t want it to start.\u201d His grandmother also died very early in 2000, aged 96, and he started thinking about her influence again. \u201cShe knew more about music than me in her old age \u2013 she was in a nursing home losing her sight, listening to the radio, talking about the songs with the young girls who looked after her. She\u2019d seen through the millennium, she\u2019d seen the fireworks on the TV, she\u2019d lived the 20th century.\u201d He still misses her. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to live as long as my grandmother. And I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KgEs3Zksg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y9KgEs3Zksg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KgEs3Zksg\">Watch the video for Say Hello, Wave Goodbye by Soft Cell.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2004, Almond had his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/18/arts.artsnews2\">closest brush with death yet</a>. A car went into the motorbike on which he was riding pillion, throwing him into the road; he suffered serious head injuries, had part of his skull removed, and took a few years to recover (his first performance back was in 2006 with Antony Hegarty, his head still shaved). His short-term memory is still affected, and a stammer he had as a child returned for a while. But he refuses to talk about the experience negatively. \u201cI found I wanted to take lots of opportunities, and have experience and adventure again. After an accident you think, what in reality is left in my life? I mean, without being very morbid, I\u2019m 60 next year \u2013 how much longer am I going to live? And how am I going to use that time really, really well?\u201d</p> <p>In the past nine years, Almond has released nine albums. They include collaborations with Current 93, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/16/john-harle-marc-almond-tyburn-tree-review\">composer John Harle</a>, and a song Jarvis Cocker wrote for him called Worship Me Now (in Pulp\u2019s seedy stories, you see Soft Cell recast in bright indie-pop colours). Almond has also thrown himself into Russian culture, covering the songs of singer Vadim Kozin on 2009\u2019s <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/02691-marc-almond-orpheus-in-exile-the-songs-of-vadim-kozin-album-review\"><em>Orpheus In Exile</em></a><em>.</em> He finds the country\u2019s gay culture particularly fascinating. \u201cI have gay friends in Moscow who see things from a very different point of view than the west. They kind of want to have this dictator... this person that tells them what to do. They all pay corrupt people under the table\u2026 there is that life there. I guess when you have this place that\u2019s absolutely a gigantic collection of gangster states, it takes a monster to look after the monsters.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/industry-queer-gay-pop-artists-frank-ocean-little-richard\">The industry closet: queer pop from Little Richard to Frank Ocean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s also on the fence about Brexit. \u201cI felt worried at first. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a European person. Then I kind of thought, what is, is. All I can think is that fighting about it is hopeless. We have to go forward and make something work, because it\u2019s not going to change.\u201d Still, he does have his anxieties. \u201cThe world is a very unsteady, strange, odd place at the moment. I have lots of anxiety and lots of worry about it. I try not to watch the news and then I get obsessed about it. You watch every day, in horror of something else [happening], and then you think the rise of the right in Europe \u2013 I just think, thank God I\u2019m getting on. I\u2019ll be \u2018come, sweet death\u2019 when it comes!\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, though, he\u2019s tried to fight age. He has tried to get into newer music \u2013 he likes the new Wild Beasts record especially \u2013 but has also embraced nostalgia with heart. He\u2019s sung with official T Rex tribute band T-Rextasy (his version of Teenage Dream is on the box set) and toured with Holy Holy, the band formed by Tony Visconti and Bowie\u2019s old drummer Mick \u201cWoody\u201d Woodmansey, performing <em>The Man Who Sold the World</em>. Visconti would often peel away from practice to take phone calls, Almond remembers \u2013 this was 2015. \u201c\u2018Who the bloody hell is this now?\u2019, he\u2019d say, then he\u2019d go, \u2018Oh, David! Hello David.\u2019 You kind of got this sense that something was not quite right.\u201d Almond also went round the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/24/david-bowie-is-exhibition-review\">Bowie V&amp;A exhibition</a> with Visconti, seeing him \u201cwandering around, looking at a synthesiser, going, \u2018I remember that from the studio floor.\u2019 All these one-armed, one-legged costumes I\u2019d seen when I stood at the front of the stage for Ziggy Stardust, and there they were, on a lifeless mannequin\u2026\u201d Almond didn\u2019t like the experience. \u201cIt already felt like David Bowie had died.\u201d</p> <p>Almond has been a regular on the somewhat cheesy Rewind 80s revival tours, which might feel like a strange fit for someone so wilfully wayward \u2013 but he\u2019s loved them. They\u2019ve given him a refreshing perspective on the early days of his fame. \u201cBack then, you\u2019d be in London for <em>Top of the Pops</em> at the Columbia hotel, opposite the Human League at breakfast, with Siouxsie and the Banshees at the bar. We were all encouraged to have this rivalry, so you\u2019d end up being quite bitchy about, I don\u2019t know, Spandau Ballet. But now doing tours with Tony Hadley\u2026\u201d His enthusiasm is obviously sweetly genuine. \u201cTony Hadley!

It remains one of the great \u201980s pop ballads, with its harsh drums and brash synthesiser line beating in the agonies, over a glorious, melancholic melody and those unmistakably English lyrics: \u201cWe tried to make it work/You in a cocktail skirt/And me in a suit/But it just wasn\u2019t me\u201d. A story about the breakdown of a relationship between a boy and girl \u201cused to wearing less\u2026under a deep red light\u201d, he feels privileged to have written it, he says. He did so in a student bedsit in Leeds, trying to do his own version of a chanson, dreaming of prostitutes and pop stars, dreaming of Soho.</p> <p>In 2016, Marc Almond has fallen out of love with the place that made him who he was \u2013 a place that has tried to be aspirational in its own chaotic, characterful, individual way for the past 450 years. It\u2019s a long time since he lived in Soho \u2013 he\u2019s now in South Bermondsey, where he\u2019s currently battling noisy neighbours \u2013 but still regularly comes into the West End. He still sings about London, and in 2014 even released two albums about it: <em>The Tyburn Tree</em> <em>(Dark London)</em> with composer, John Harle, and a live recording of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/08/ten-plagues-edinburgh-almond-review\"><em>Ten Plagues</em></a>, about London after the Great Fire, written by Mark Ravenhill.

And then the bickering overcame the laughs, and it just became bickering, and then I suddenly felt \u2013 I never thought I would say this \u2013 I don\u2019t think I can take this any more.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/25/savage-song-soft-cell-bedsitter\">Jon Savage on song: Soft Cell \u2013 Bedsitter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he gets older, he also thinks more of where he comes from, and even thinks he might return to Southport, which he wrote about beautifully on the title track of his most recent album, 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/05/marc-almond-the-velvet-trail-review\"><em>The Velvet Trail</em></a>. In it, he wanders old arcades where teenage dreams are won and lost, and summer leaves without saying goodbye. \u201cIt\u2019s a song about where you go back to at the end of your life, and Southport is such an inspiring place to me. I still feel it was a bit part of my makeup as a child, the loneliness of seaside towns, and the sea out of season.\u201d He smiles, ruefully. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing so sad as the sea out of season.\u201d</p> <p>But Almond\u2019s not finished with music just yet. He\u2019s recently signed to a major label for the first time since 1999 and a new record is planned for next year. The approach from Universal about this box set also gave him fresh energy. He finds the renewed interest surprising and exciting.</p> <p>He also knows that if he had his time again, he\u2019d take mainstream success every time. \u201cWhen someone fringe like me is given a chance, is given 35 years in the mainstream, it\u2019s a great chance to be subversive, to get other ideas and other things across to people. I\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d Almond sounds a little sad as he speaks, but there\u2019s hope around the edges of his words. \u201cI\u2019m someone who likes taking the past with me, really.

  "<p>While Dorothy, blue-skirted and pigtailed, clutching a wicker basket and a bewildered dog under her arm, surveys the weird flowers and pygmy huts around her, she\u2019s sure of just one thing: she\u2019s not in Kansas any more. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/14/wizard-of-oz-digested-classic\">L Frank Baum</a>\u2019s character was, it turns out, born slightly too early. In 1901, a year after the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/19/fiction6\"><em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em></a>, Baum wrote <em>The Master Key</em>, a novel credited with the invention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/21/augmented-reality-iphone-advertising\">augmented reality</a> via a pair of imagined spectacles that could map information on to whatever or whomever its wearer looked at. Had Dorothy owned a pair, she might have learned that she\u2019d been whisked to Oz, or that her new friend the Tin Man was in need of a heart, even, perhaps, that a wicked witch is burned not by fire, but by water.</p> <p>It was almost a century until Baum\u2019s invention gained a label. In a 1992 research paper, the Boeing engineers <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OyGiW2OYI8AC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=1992+research+paper,+the+Boeing+engineers+Thomas+Caudell+and+David+Mizell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZZGR0-N_G7&amp;sig=Ddupwmjba8_xhhaIfnCy8GuF2ko&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje9L7miuTPAhUHthQKHQsHA2oQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=1992%20research%20paper%2C%20the%20Boeing%20engineers%20Thomas%20Caudell%20and%20David%20Mizell&amp;f=false\">Thomas Caudell and David Mizell</a> described a pair of \u201csee-thru virtual reality goggles\u201d, a device that would enhance the vision of factory workers with the complicated task of piecing together a jumbo jet\u2019s nests of internal wiring with dynamically changing labels and information. Caudell termed this principle of annotating the seen world \u201caugmented reality\u201d, thereby formalising for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</a>\u2019s mavens and investors a fresh and unplundered field of technological opportunity, one that would eventually lead to the invention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-glass\">Google Glass</a>, a pair of information-spewing spectacles built, unbelievably, to Baum\u2019s century-old definition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who wouldn\u2019t like a natural history programme where the dinosaurs roam across your room?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the breathless press releases are to be believed, 2016 has been the year of virtual reality \u2013 a discarded technology that, thanks to the revolution in low-cost components heralded by smartphones, is currently enjoying a lavish revival. Sony, Facebook and HTC have all launched expensive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/14/google-translate-app-update-break-language-barrier\">miraculous visors</a> that transport us into fabricated realities, fooling the brain into believing that, like Dorothy, we\u2019ve been bodily transported to another place. At its best, VR allows us to visit places too remote, too dangerous or too expensive to otherwise reach. Documentarians are using the nascent medium to allow us to experience life through the eyes of another. But VR technology also has numerous drawbacks. As well as the cost (just 3% of Britons are expected to invest in a serious headset this year, the cheapest of which costs \u00a3350, even without the PlayStation needed to run it) there\u2019s also the sense of vulnerability that wearers experience while sitting blind in front of the television, as well as the perils of bumping into furniture. As one Microsoft spokesperson put it, VR users are \u201cbest advised to stay seated or keep still to avoid collisions\u201d.</p> <p>AR, while not having quite the same transporting effects, gets around this issue by layering its simulated elements over the real world. Through a pair of AR glasses, or a smartphone\u2019s camera, you are able to see both the elbow-y chair and teetering lamp in front of you, and the data that overlays it. Microsoft\u2019s apparent scepticism about VR is understandable; the company has instead focused millions of R&amp;D dollars into AR (or, as the company prefers to term it, \u201cmixed reality\u201d) via its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/09/hololens-microsoft-virtual-world-augmented-reality-\">HoloLens</a>, a see-through PC-in-a-visor that launches in November for the precise and gargantuan cost of <a href=\"http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2473929/want-a-microsoft-hololens-headset-itll-cost-you-gbp2-719\">\u00a32,719</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"925e0fa58e641efe7826f3483a8088e518f7cf2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925e0fa58e641efe7826f3483a8088e518f7cf2b/0_109_1536_1745/880.jpg\" alt=\"Star Chart lets you annotate the night sky using GPS positioning.\" width=\"880\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star Chart lets you annotate the night sky using GPS positioning on your smartphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Escape Velocity Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Microsoft believes that HoloLens is the next evolution for AR, technology that we have seen for years whenever, for example, a weather reporter gestures toward a virtual map behind them in a television studio, or a football pundit offers an assessment of the starting 11 in a football match, as digital versions of the players magically appear in front of them on the desk. In HoloLens the data isn\u2019t merely layered on top of the world you\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s conjured and anchored into the environment around you. In this way, you can play Minecraft on the dining room table, walking around the room in order to get a different perspective on your creation. For Microsoft, it\u2019s a way to pull the software on which we rely from our smartphone screens into the room, a holographic conjuring act that, as the spokesperson puts it, enables us to \u201cinteract with them in the same way we interact with physical objects\u201d.</p> <p>For Caudell, who coined the term AR, the technology, which he believed would be adopted across industries such as architecture, automotive design, building construction and even medicine never quite took off in the ways he expected. \u201cThere were technical and cultural issues at that time that kept it in the research lab,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that sense it was probably ahead of its time.\u201d The pervasiveness and power of smartphones has, however, \u201cdrastically opened up the market,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the success of AR games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/12/pokemon-go-becomes-global-phenomenon-as-number-of-us-users-overtakes-twitter\"><em>Pok\u00e9mon Go!</em></a>, which was downloaded more than <a href=\"http://www.techtimes.com/articles/172156/20160802/pok%C3%A9mon-go-reaches-100-million-downloads-earns-over-10-million-in-daily-revenue.htm\">100 million times</a> in its first month, reportedly earning $10m per day at the height of its popularity, has attracted widespread attention and investment. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether all the attention is warranted,\u201d says Caudell. \u201cBut the potential for benefit is huge.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/how-to-use-snapchat-tips-join-conversation\">New to Snapchat? Here\u2019s how to join the conversation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the BBC, which has been using AR elements in its programming for more than a decade, the next generation of technology is opening up extraordinary possibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming possible to break down all the aspects of a traditional programme \u2013 like a presenter, an overlay and even the sound \u2013 and treat them as separate objects,\u201d explains Graham Thomas, from the corporation\u2019s R&amp;D department. This could enable, Thomas claims, new kinds of TV programming. \u201cIt might be as simple as swapping out the usual presenter of a show for one who uses sign language, or automatically editing a news report to fit the time you have available. Or it might allow you to create AR experiences by reusing the objects from a TV show in a novel way. Who wouldn\u2019t like a natural history programme where the dinosaurs roam across your coffee table?\u201d</p> <p>This kind of speculative pitching may sell AR to venture capitalists (according to Digi-Capital, investment in VR and AR in the 12 months from March 2015 to March 2016 exceeded $1.7bn) but consumers soon tire of gimmickry. \u201cAs with any emerging technology, the experiences need to be compelling enough once the novelty has worn off,\u201d says Thomas.</p> <p>Besides, simplicity, rather than ambition, is where AR has proved itself. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/how-to-use-snapchat-tips-join-conversation\">Snapchat</a>, the social media platform beloved of tweens, where your messages self-destruct after a few seconds, has produced perhaps the most widely used AR app in the world via its novelty camera filters which, for example, add dog ears and a lolling tongue in real time to the camera feed of one\u2019s face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ba35abd63a5ef6a7c2d1b28699e4170827c1dd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ba35abd63a5ef6a7c2d1b28699e4170827c1dd6/0_0_939_934/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Inkhunter app lets you visualise how a tattoo might look.\" width=\"500\" height=\"497\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inkhunter allows you to visualise how a tattoo might look on your body.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inkhunter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Alex Fleetwood, the designer of Beasts of Balance, a forthcoming boardgame that uses AR to complement the play experience, Snapchat\u2019s AR filters show how the technology can remain compelling, at scale. \u201cAdding fun things to video has become a natural extension of putting emoji at the end of your DMs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While some point to HoloLens and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/07/magic-leap-headset-design-patent-virtual-reality\">MagicLeap</a> (another AR headset that accounts for the majority of that $1.7bn in investment) as the future of AR, for Fleetwood Snapchat\u2019s lighter, less invasive approach is a better vision. \u201cI believe in AR much more than VR, which in my view really is a bubble. But we need to get away from the idea that AR means wearing a computer on your face. Smartphones have already intervened in our social dynamics in ways we\u2019re still coming to terms with. I think faces are going to be a big no-go area for most people.\u201d</p> <p>For AR\u2019s architects, the possibilities of further democratising information, and placing relevant facts and directions on to the real world, may be enough to convince us to move technology from our palms to our faces. \u201cI consider accurate, readily available information a human right,\u201d says Caudell. \u201cMaybe AR technology will help spread the information riches to everyone. But, yes, as with any invasive technology, I remain concerned about the unintended consequences.\u201d As with so many technological breakthroughs and refinements in the past decade, humanity\u2019s engineers are realising science fiction\u2019s blueprints, without reconciling them with science fiction\u2019s accompanying warnings.</p> <p>In Baum\u2019s <em>The Master Key</em>, which was subtitled with a phrase that offers a rather delicious description of Silicon Valley \u2013 <em>An Electrical Fairy Tale, Founded Upon the Mysteries of Electricity and the Optimism of Its Devotees</em> \u2013 the protagonist is given the magical spectacles by a demon. After a fortnight\u2019s adventuring, he concludes that neither he nor the world is ready for the specs. On the third week, he returns the invention until, he says, that time when humankind knows how to use them.</p> <p>\u201cThere are competing notions of what AR is going to be,\u201d says Fleetwood. \u201cThere are the people who think we\u2019re going to be living in some mass consensual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/13/seveneves-by-neal-stephenson-disaster-novel\">Neal Stephenson</a> novel. I\u2019m very against that.

  "<p>In July 2013, a large, strangely shaped beetle emerged from the fabric of a wooden chair that had just been bought in the UK. The inch-long creature had developed inside the chair\u2019s wooden frame before it ate its way to the surface and burst through the seat\u2019s plastic covering \u2013 much to the alarm of its purchaser. Crucially, the furniture had been made in, and imported from, China.</p> <p>Analysis by Fera Science, formerly the Food and Environment Research Agency, showed the beetle was a Japanese pine sawyer. Worse, the beetle was found to be infested with a second serious pest: the pinewood nematode worm. In combination, the beetle (<em>Monochamus alternatus</em>) and worm (<em>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</em>) have been linked to widespread damage to pine forests in China and Japan. Now it is spreading through parts of Europe.</p> <p>In this case, the invaders were destroyed after staff at Fera Science traced the chair and destroyed several other contaminated items of furniture from the same consignment. But the warning was clear. Britain and its trees are coming under increasing pressure from a range of foreign pathogens, a point underlined last week when scientists revealed that the horse chestnut tree was now being threatened by a different invader \u2013 the leaf miner moth, which has spread through England and Wales, and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/conker-tree-parasite-scotland\" title=\"\">recently discovered in Scotland</a>.</p> <p>The leaf miner (<em>Cameraria ohridella</em>) does not kill conkers directly but leaves trees weakened, while their seeds are small and shrivelled. Younger trees are killed off, and mature trees are left susceptible to deadly diseases such as bleeding canker.</p> <p>The threat to the British landscape is one of the worst since Dutch elm disease wiped out millions of trees in the 1970s. It includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ash-dieback\" title=\"\">ash dieback</a> (<em>Hymenoscyphus fraxineus</em>), which is caused by a fungus that quickly kills young ash trees, and older trees more slowly. Scientists have warned that the fungal spores spread so easily that the disease could eventually wipe out the UK\u2019s estimated 80&#xa0;million ashes, one of our commonest trees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/14/scientists-people-power-find-disease-ash-resistant-trees\">Scientists use people power to find disease-resistant ash trees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The British tree is being ravaged as never before, it would seem. \u201cThere is no doubt that the threat from foreign pathogens to our trees is growing,\u201d said Professor Rick Mumford, a scientist at Fera Science. \u201cYou can see a clear trend. More and more are appearing, and dealing with them is getting harder and harder.\u201d</p> <p>Climate change, which is warming Britain and making it more hospitable to many foreign insects and pests, is a factor. But Mumford was emphatic that the most common way invaders are getting into Britain and infecting our trees is through imported wood. This is often for packaging, and very frequently originates in China. \u201cThe volume of wood sent as packaging or as items such as furniture is vast,\u201d he added.</p> <p>One example of this dangerous influx is provided by several dozen trees that were found, in 2012, to be infested by the Asian longhorn beetle (<em>Anoplophora glabripennis</em>) in Paddock Wood, Kent. More than 250 live larvae were discovered. Crucially, Forestry Commission experts said they believed the beetles \u2013 a threat to sycamore, ash, birch, willow, poplar and some fruit trees \u2013 had emerged from wood packaging used to import slate from China to a site near the outbreak. Thousands of trees in Paddock Wood had to be cut down to contain the outbreak.</p> <p>In that case, the wooden packaging, rather than the goods inside, was to blame. In the case of the Japanese pine sawyer beetle it was the product itself \u2013 a chair \u2013 that was infected.</p> <p>Joe Ostoj\u00e1-Starzewski of Fera, writing in an article \u201cImported furniture \u2013 a pathway for the introduction of plant pests\u201d in the bulletin of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, said large volumes of chairs of a construction similar to those found to be infested with the beetle are now being brought into the UK. In 2012-13, 84,000 such chairs were imported. \u201cThis trade clearly offers a pathway with the potential for multiple and widespread introductions of wood inhabiting pests,\u201d Ostoja-Starzewski wrote.</p> <p>Mumford agreed. \u201cWood goods and packaging should be treated so they do not carry pathogens, but clearly this process is not being enforced as strictly as it should be in some cases,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/31/ash-dieback-gm-genetic-modification-woodland-crisis\">With 90% of the UK\u2019s ash trees about to be wiped out, could GM be the answer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This point was acknowledged by Nicola Spence, chief plant health officer of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. \u201cIncreasing global trade does mean that our plants face increased threat from the spread of pests and diseases,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t eliminate all risks but we have stringent plans to deal with threats, and take prompt action should they be detected. We work closely with neighbouring countries, the wider international community as well as industry, NGOs, landowners and the public to reduce the risks of pests and diseases entering the country.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also working to build the resilience of our trees and plants \u2013 this helps to mitigate the impact of pests that have already arrived. From 2012 to 2019 we will have invested more than \u00a337m into tree health research.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is the situation universally gloomy for already infected trees. In the case of ash dieback, some trees have been found to be resistant, with UK trees proving to be particularly resilient. \u201cThat does offer hope that we could one day regenerate the ash,\u201d added Mumford.</p> <h2>KILLER INSECTS</h2> <p>\u25a0 The leaf miner moth (<em>Cameraria ohridella</em>) kills young conker trees and makes mature trees susceptible to deadly diseases such as bleeding canker.</p> <p>\u25a0 Japanese pine sawyer beetle (<em>Monochamus alternatus</em>) and pinewood nematode (<em>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</em>) have caused widespread damage to Asian pine forests.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Asian longhorn beetle (<em>Anoplophora glabripennis</em>) is a threat to sycamore, ash, birch, willow, poplar and some fruit trees.</p>",
  "<p>Slang has always fascinated me. My father, who grew up in the council estates of Slough during the second world war, knew slang words for most situations, good and bad, which I would hear regularly around the house as a child.</p> <p>Somewhere in my early 20s, I stumbled across a cheap secondhand reprint of a book by an 18th-century Londoner named Francis Grose, which recorded the everyday speech of the people he encountered in the low drinking dens, bagnios and rookeries around Covent Garden and St Giles. First published in 1785, <em>A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</em> remains for me the single most important slang collection of them all. Bawdy, mocking, occasionally brutal, superbly inventive and yet somehow overwhelmingly good-hearted, it helped fuel my interest these past 30-odd years in the language of everyday people \u2013 not as heard in drawing rooms or public orations, but late at night three sheets to the wind, or dodging shells in the trenches, when circumstances call for choice expressions that sum things up or cut them down.</p> <p>Having spent the past four years writing a history of English slang, it gradually became clear to me that the digital age is altering slang: both the way it evolves and is spread, and attitudes towards it. Many of the historical sayings documented in my book \u2013 such as referring to a modern-day sex worker by the 13th century term, soiled dove, or employing a 200-year-old name for a gay man, backgammon player \u2013 would now be unacceptable to someone or other online, busily taking offence on behalf of everyone else. It is all right to publish these terms in a book \u2013 or deploy a magnificent variety of them in an award-winning series such as <em>The Sopranos</em> \u2013 but try uttering any of them on social media and see how far that gets you. Is this form of speech under threat?</p> <p>Of course, slang has always had its detractors. <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/CN1926-01-16.pdf\" title=\"\">Ramsay MacDonald, Britain\u2019s first Labour prime minister, declared</a> in 1925 that using slang in conversation was the mark of \u201cdecadent minds\u201d, and that such talk \u201cmurders truth itself\u201d. The American lexicographer Noah Webster dismissed it in his original <a href=\"http://webstersdictionary1828.com/\" title=\"\">1828 dictionary</a> as \u201clow vulgar unmeaning language\u201d. The poet <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/carl-sandburg\" title=\"\">Carl Sandburg</a> defined slang rather more poetically as \u201clanguage that takes off its coat, spits on its hands and goes to work\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31c273441efcf261711621d8f5c20423796470c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31c273441efcf261711621d8f5c20423796470c4/88_56_1898_3094/613.jpg\" alt=\"18th century slang-collector Francis Grose.\" width=\"613\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">18th century slang-collector Francis Grose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: to come</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it goes to work or not, people have often determined that slang should be kept out of school. In October 2013, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/15/london-school-bans-pupils-slang-innit\" title=\"\">London academy</a> attempted to outlaw the use of certain slang words and phrases among its pupils, to help them perform well at interviews for universities and jobs. To that end, the school put up signs that read:</p> <p><em>BANNED WORDS:</em><br><em>COZ</em><br><em>AINT</em><br><em>LIKE</em><br><em>BARE</em><br><em>EXTRA</em><br><em>INNIT</em><br><em>YOU WOZ and WE WOZ</em></p> <p><em>Beginning sentences with BASICALLY</em><br><em>Ending sentences with YEAH</em></p> <p>Much slang starts out as a kind of low-level guerrilla warfare directed at straight society, designed to keep out the squares, or annoy them, and is then abandoned by the originators once the words have become common currency. Groovy was the hip new jazz word of the early 1940s, batted around by bebop musicians and pulp novelists. Twenty years later, it was as mainstream as they come, co-opted by every branch of the media \u2013 so that today it is routinely taken for a 60s term. Ageing jazzers were probably choking on their berets listening to Simon and Garfunkel in <a href=\"http://www.paulsimon.com/song/59th-street-bridge-song-feelin-groovy/\" title=\"\">The 59th Street Bridge Song</a> (1966) singing about \u201cfeeling groovy\u201d, as a once exclusive in-word suddenly flooded the airwaves.</p> <p>One obvious drawback for the slang user is that often the hip word of today turns unexpectedly into the embarrassingly square word of tomorrow. Indeed, the word \u201chip\u201d itself only became hip after its predecessor, \u201chep\u201d, fell out of favour, as noted by <a href=\"http://blogssomdearie.blogspot.co.uk/p/discography.html\" title=\"\">Blossom Dearie</a> in the song I\u2019m Hip (1966): \u201cWhen it was hip to be hep, I was hep\u201d. One example of this kind of change has a personal resonance for me. In 2000, I published a book of words and phrases drawn from a lifetime\u2019s obsession with the language of vintage crime fiction, film noir, jazz, blues, hillbilly, rockabilly and rock\u2019n\u2019roll music. I called the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/nov/14/guide-guidelines-50s-hipster-slang\" title=\"\"><em>Straight From the Fridge, Dad</em></a>, an adaptation of a slang phrase meaning \u201ccool\u201d that I\u2019d heard in that jewel among teenage exploitation films, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Girl\" title=\"\"><em>Beat Girl</em></a> (1960). The book was a compendium of phrases associated with the more outre fringes of society \u2013 musicians, mobsters, beatniks, con artists \u2013 of the first half of the 20th century, the language of outsiders. In the book\u2019s subtitle, I used a term that most jazz musicians of the late 1940s bebop era would have been proud to bear \u2013 hipster \u2013 meaning someone who was one of the sharpest, the most in the know, and I had no problem calling my book <em>A Dictionary of Hipster Slang</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhr-zPTP250\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rhr-zPTP250?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhr-zPTP250\">Watch the trailer for Beat Girl, repository of choice slang such as \u2018straight from the fridge, dad\u2019.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Two years after it was published in the UK and the US, an American book appeared called <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97775/the-hipster-handbook-by-robert-lanham/9781400032013/\" title=\"\"><em>The Hipster Handbook</em></a> by Robert Lanham, full of nerdy lifestyle material seemingly aimed more at ivy league squares, and somehow this has become the default modern meaning of the term: geek chic. It describes people who, according to Lanham, enjoy \u201cstrutting in platform shoes with a biography of Che Guevara sticking out of their bags\u201d, which shows how far the word has travelled since the days of alto sax giant Charlie Parker or boogie pianist Harry \u201cthe Hipster\u201d Gibson. In Britain these days, the word hipster is frequently used as an insult, in much the same way that in the punk days of the late 1970s, one of the most damning labels you could hang on anyone was to call them a poser.</p> <p>By the same token, the slang greeting \u201cYo!\u201d has taken a long, strange path over the years. When rappers Public Enemy named their 1987 debut LP <em>Yo! Bum Rush the Show</em>, this was very much the language of the street. Yet, fast-forward two decades to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/08/tonyblair.labour11\" title=\"\">off-air private conversation</a> between two politicians at the G8 summit in Switzerland, as jive-talking George W Bush greets the then British prime minister Tony Blair:</p> <p>GWB: Yo!

Mind you, this is a man who warned a Washington audience in 2004 about \u201cthese hateful few who have no conscience, who kill at the whim of a hat\u201d, and assured a New Hampshire chamber of commerce in 2000 that \u201cI know how hard it is for you to put food on your family\u201d, so he clearly enjoys a special relationship, not so much with England, but with the English language in general.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e6e80a266b65239cf08b1ccff1311e287c2daa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e6e80a266b65239cf08b1ccff1311e287c2daa5/0_193_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Yo, Blair!\u2019: George W Bush lays some slang on Tony Blair at the 2006 G8 summit, unaware of a nearby microphone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Yo, Blair!\u2019: George W Bush lays some slang on Tony Blair at the 2006 G8 summit, unaware of a nearby microphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first glance, this might look like a straightforward example of a politician making a lamentable attempt to be \u201cdown with the kids\u201d. Yet the conversation between Bush and Blair was recorded without their knowledge, and there was no thought of trying to impress the younger members of the electorate with this language. This was not the case in 2016 when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/ravin-chattin-roamin-eu-remain-campaign-appeals-to-young-voters\" title=\"\">Britain Stronger in Europe campaign</a> group \u2013 headed by Conservative peer Lord Rose and partly bankrolled by a number of prominent hedge-fund managers \u2013 attempted to persuade young people to vote in favour of remaining in the European Union by means of a much-derided, supposedly streetwise advert, complete with obligatory hashtag:</p> <p>WORKIN, LEARNIN, EARNIN, SHOPPIN, RAVIN, CHATTIN, ROAMIN, MAKIN, MEETIN, SHARIN, GOIN, LIVIN \u2026 Make sure you\u2019re #VOTIN</p> <p>Newspapers have generally been keen to give their readership an insight into the ways of slang. The <em>Observer</em>, only a year after it was first published in 1791, informed the public that \u201cthe slang technical term for persons in the pillory is babes in the wood\u201d. These days, most papers run \u201cnew words of the year\u201d articles, in which we are told, for example, that twerking had been brought in from the wilderness. This word for a type of dancing had been around in rap circles for roughly two decades \u2013 first surfacing in a 1992 New Orleans bounce track by DJ Jubilee called Do the Jubilee All \u2013 though the term would have meant little to anyone outside of Louisiana. A friend of mine from Texas tells me that her young son picked up the word in 2005 because so many children evacuated from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina arrived at his school, bringing local slang with them.</p> <p>Twerking came to worldwide prominence after a performance by Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke on 25 August 2013 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2013/aug/26/mtv-vma-miley-cyrus-criticism-video\" title=\"\">MTV\u2019s annual video music awards</a> in New York.

The song was called, with the deathless logic of a corporation at full cry in search of a dollar, Twerk. As blogger <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-28-miley-cyrus-justin-bieber-twerk-song-listen-lil-twist#.WAd6fDYrLAw\" title=\"\">Perez Hilton</a> put it: \u201cOn the heels of Miley Cyrus\u2019 twerktastic evening at the VMAs comes the single that is going to BLOW YOUR TWEEN MIND!\u201d Or not, as the case may be. Among the comments left by fans below this news item were \u201cpuke\u201d, \u201cgross\u201d, \u201cthis song sucks\u201d, and the considerably more eloquent \u201cI think this song signals there is no hope for us, it\u2019s over, we had a good run, society, however, has&#xa0;failed.\u201d</p> <p>Owing to the internet and 24-hour global media, the word twerk went from cool to embarrassing in record time, its recognition factor spreading so far outside its original core group that <a href=\"http://privateeyenews.tumblr.com/post/60443648629/from-eye-1348-by-robert-thompson\" title=\"\"><em>Private Eye</em></a> was able to print a cartoon just weeks afterwards, showing a group of elderly gents in cloth caps gyrating arthritically in a building labelled \u201cTwerking Men\u2019s Club\u201d, confident that readers of all ages would understand the meaning of the&#xa0;word.</p> <p>Slang used to come from the street, from the working stiffs, the grafters, the taxi-dancers, the jack-rollers, the winchester geese, the hep-cats, the old lags, the mollies, the lobsters and the jug-bitten. Much of the time, it still does, but it is now fighting against a tidal wave of fake language deployed by committees of marketing executives or focus groups, all desperately seeking to look cool.</p> <p>In March 1984, the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Washington correspondent, Alex Brummer, reported that the word yuppie was one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s hottest new status descriptions\u201d. (The other he mentioned, yummie \u2013 \u201cyoung upwardly mobile moderate\u201d \u2013 seems to have died an early death.) The same year also saw the publication of Marissa Piesman and Marilee Hartley\u2019s tongue-in-cheek work <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yuppie-Handbook-State-Manual-Professionals/dp/067147684X\" title=\"\"><em>The Yuppie Handbook: The State-of-the-Art Manual for Young Urban Professionals</em></a>, with its cover showing a power-suited couple proudly sporting must-have items such as a Rolex watch, a Gucci briefcase and a Sony Walkman. <em>Newsweek</em> rounded off December with a <a href=\"http://2407asg14.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/newsweek-year-of-yuppie.html\" title=\"\">cover feature</a> declaring 1984 \u201cthe year of the yuppie\u201d.</p> <p>Yet no one from the streets would have come up with a term based on the words \u201cyoung urban professional\u201d \u2013 it smacked of advertising speak. Far more authentic, and of similar vintage, was the mocking English acronym \u201clombard\u201d \u2013 loads of money but a right dickhead.</p> <p>In today\u2019s online information blizzard, billions of words are sent out into the fray in the hope of causing a Twitter storm, trending on Facebook or gaining countless plays on YouTube, alongside tap-dancing kittens and the latest celebrity wardrobe malfunction.

Witch-hunts are conducted against words, thoughts and&#xa0;modes of behaviour. Judgments are made, sentences passed, and appeals are futile. Ultimately, slang will have no place in this world, because the best of it is guaranteed to offend someone somewhere.</p> <p>We live in an age in which pretty much every sexual activity known to the human race has been filmed and is available online \u2013 something many people in the 60s would perhaps have considered a liberated and long-overdue state of affairs. Yet numerous slang words for describing these activities would now be deemed unsayable in most public forums. That same technological advance has also made it possible to view footage of real-life atrocities, and brutality can be routinely filmed by the perpetrators using a cheap device carried in almost everyone\u2019s pocket.

When we left the kayaks and walked into the forest, he began moving by sound, hearing things I could not. \u201cThere\u2019s a woolly monkey.\u201d And then he would mimic their call with uncanny accuracy, bringing the woolly monkeys into view.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/yasuni-man-film-ecuador-ryan-killackey\">Yasuni Man film is an intimate portrait of a beautiful land under siege for its oil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The trees were frothy with epiphytic ferns, orchids and bromeliads, each a habitat for more species than an entire secondary forest. Victor began squeaking and something answered. \u201cGolden-mantled tamarin,\u201d he whispered, and we left the path, circling the massive buttresses of a sabre tree, and briefly sighted a fabulous orange and black monkey. A hummingbird hurtled past my ear so fast I didn\u2019t even see it, just felt the air tremble, but Victor spotted the greenish blur and identified it.</p> <p>As the day continued, we added to our primate sightings: black-mantled tamarins, and a pair of night monkeys peering timidly from a hole in a tree. We spent an hour under a tree while Victor guided my eyes to the smallest monkey in the world, the pygmy marmoset \u2013 its body barely 15cm long.</p> <p>The sun was setting by the time we headed back towards the kayaks. It had been a long, successful day, but it wasn\u2019t quite over. Victor came to a sudden halt then, with a quick \u201cCome on!\u201d we were running as silently as possible through jungle, dodging vines and pausing to listen. The forest was dark beneath the canopy. A few late golden rays touched some upper trees. We crossed a stream, climbed a slope then abruptly doubled back. Perched on a low branch in one last ray of light, was a huge bird with a red bill. I had a great view for a few seconds, then it was gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1398879afcf2434beab5b790e445989385bc4094\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1398879afcf2434beab5b790e445989385bc4094/0_86_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil installation along the Napo river, Ecuador.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oil installation at one of the villages along the Napo river that has chosen to exploit the oil reserves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSalvin\u2019s curassow!\u201d said Victor. \u201cOh, you\u2019re so lucky!

When she\u2019s not doing that, you\u2019ve probably seen her on telly as a science presenter for the BBC. She has just finished her first book, <em>Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life</em>, and if that\u2019s not enough she also plays badminton competitively.

This business of having two phases together \u2013 a liquid and a gas interacting \u2013 is such a useful thing. It gives you something that neither a gas or a liquid can do on its own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As the sea ice retreats the Arctic Ocean is more exposed\u2026 I\u2019d like to go and study the bubbles underneath breaking waves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Like what?</strong><br>Take the foam on top of a cappuccino.

Whether it\u2019s a politician or a salesman, you need to know the rules they\u2019re playing by. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an expert on weather systems or on double glazing or cars or mattresses or phones, but if you know the basics it gives you the confidence to ask the right questions. Say someone is trying to sell you a swanky smartphone case to make your reception better, or a magnetic bracelet they say will cure your wrist pain, you can ask \u201cwell, how does it work?\u201d and if you know the basics you can tell whether they know what they are talking about or whether they\u2019re just making things up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c97401bf93cd3d4cadee8e8aad0a0be1b6d20df2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c97401bf93cd3d4cadee8e8aad0a0be1b6d20df2/156_0_1570_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image of the arctic shows comparative ice melt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite image of the Arctic shows comparative ice melt: an opportunity for bubble research, says Czerski.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>But a lot of people shun physics because it seems so complicated and irrelevant.</strong><br>I know. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a good job in talking about physics. People get the impression that it\u2019s all about quantum weirdness or stars and time and the universe, but it\u2019s also about quite basic things. Physics is about patterns that are folded into our everyday lives. It\u2019s much more accessible than people think and we should be telling them that. But nobody else is, so I am.</p> <p><strong>Do you have an example from your book?</strong><br>OK. How about the way that tea sloshes around when you walk helping to explain why mobile phone signals don\u2019t interfere with each other? Tea sloshes at different rates in different size mugs, faster in little mugs and slower in bigger ones. The reason you spill tea when you walk is that it just so happens that the walking speed of a normal human is almost exactly the same as the slopping speed in your average mug. The walking speed exactly reinforces the slopping speed, so you spill the tea if you walk normally \u2013 walk slowly or with a tiny mug or a gigantic mug and you won\u2019t spill a drop. Mobile phone signals work on the same principle. They\u2019ve each got a really precisely tuned resonance \u2013 or electron slopping rate \u2013 so that you can have two people sitting next to each other on two phones having two different conversations and they won\u2019t interfere with each other.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I see choosing to have an adventure as a rational decision, even though it might look irrational</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Is there a tension between being a scientist and being a television presenter?</strong><br>The biggest tension is time. It\u2019s definitely more than one job, however you want to add it up. There are benefits: I learn a lot. I\u2019ve definitely met people and learned things that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have if I stayed in my lab like a lot of scientists do. There are similarities between the two, too. The most important thing, whether it\u2019s doing scientific research or presenting or writing, is understanding the situation clearly enough to be able to pick out exactly the right question. To organise all the ideas into a hierarchy and say: \u201cThis [jabs at an imaginary point with her finger], this is the important thing that it all hangs on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It must be tough to make time for yourself?</strong><br>Not really. I manage to do some kind of sport \u2013 badminton or running or canoeing \u2013 almost every day. One of the things that I find mystifying is that people tend to think of scientists as somehow \u201cother\u201d, somehow alien. I\u2019ve sometimes not been invited to normal, mundane things that I\u2019d enjoy because people assume I\u2019m off doing something higher. It\u2019s true that I read a lot of books and play with ideas but the washing machine breaks for me, too!</p> <p><strong>So what\u2019s your biggest non-science, non-sport guilty pleasure?</strong><br>I guess I\u2019m not allowed to say reading, am I?</p> <p><strong>No.</strong><br>Erm\u2026 chocolate. Dark chocolate with hazelnuts.</p> <p><strong>Of what are you most proud in your career?</strong><br>Overcoming being extremely shy. I was too shy to speak as a child and it\u2019s something I only really began to overcome around the time of my PhD [in experimental explosives physics at the University of Cambridge]. Academically, I\u2019m probably most proud of building instruments that go out into the open ocean and measure things that we have never been able to measure before. There\u2019s something quite satisfying about drawing a ridiculous machine on a piece of paper and then a few years later having this monstrous thing sitting in front of you, pushing a button and it working.</p> <p><strong>If money or logistics were not an issue, what would your dream experiment be?</strong><br>I\u2019d like to go to the Arctic and study the bubbles underneath breaking waves there.

And no, I don\u2019t mean the comedians on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been tuning into Monocle\u2019s Trump v Clinton podcast, <a href=\"https://monocle.com/radio/shows/the-global-election/4/\"><strong>The Global Election</strong></a>. Presented by Steve Bloomfield, this half-hour weekly programme brings in high-level experts on foreign policy, international terrorism, City finance, Europe and China to discuss what might happen in countries that are not the US after the US election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We listeners are like the waiters at a grownup dinner party, earwigging on the high-end conversations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once you\u2019ve got over the weird disconnect of hearing well-informed people offer considered views on Donald Trump and what his presidency might entail, this is really interesting. (It is strange at first, like having a professor of logic analyse the rantings of an angry toddler.) In the most recent episode, Chris Phillips, former head of the UK\u2019s counter-terrorism office, points out that Trump is aiding Isis \u2013 playing into their hands \u2013 by trying to split the US along racial and religious lines. In the show on Europe, there are a few really fascinating points about how Trump\u2019s admiration for Putin means that the Baltic states are suspicious of him, but also how his (US) nationalism chimes with many of them, too.</p> <p>In the same episode, Yanis Varoufakis (Greece\u2019s ex-finance minister) compares Trump to Mussolini, but he also calls Clinton a \u201cthoroughly dangerous prospect for geopolitical peace\u201d. And all this is done with impeccable politesse. We listeners are like the waiters at a grownup dinner party, earwigging on the high-end conversations.</p> <p>As a side point, it was <a href=\"https://monocle.com/radio/\">Monocle radio</a>\u2019s fifth birthday last week, so congrats and bumps and happy birthday etc. The shows on Monocle \u2013 there are loads, covering urban living, culture, finance, news \u2013 have always been of an immensely high standard. They\u2019re like the magazine: clever, international, but also a teensy bit smug and sans jokes. Lovely antidotes to the ramblings of unprepared podcast \u201cpersonalities\u201d.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another Trump-ish podcast. <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/whoisneil\"><strong>#WhoisNeil</strong></a> is an odd story. About eight months ago, computer coder Nathan Bernard started wondering why and how a tweeter called Neil Turner was always the first to comment on Donald Trump\u2019s tweets.</p> <p>Was Turner a Trump-bot? Kind of. He turned out to be a real person who uses a computer program to make sure his replies were first. Bernard found all this out and created his own bot to respond first to \u201cNeil\u201d whenever he tweeted. Then Bernard started talking to \u201cNeil\u201d on social media. And then he made a podcast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"39cd58db86d4728e2b28d9a2b83cee7a0185dbb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39cd58db86d4728e2b28d9a2b83cee7a0185dbb7/0_0_1338_1672/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rich Hall\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Always a delight\u2019: Rich Hall on the US election trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Parker/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight episodes in and the podcast is\u2026 OK. Not brilliant. Bernard speaks slowly, without much dynamism and he\u2019s not the world\u2019s best storyteller. The use of music is odd and there is much techy chat that leaves me cold. It gets better when Bernard starts delving into the alt-right movement. God, they are odd, these people, blethering on about how \u201cthe US is supposed to be whites only\u201d and other vile rubbish. There is interesting stuff here, but listening makes you long for a presenter like Jon Ronson or Louis Theroux.</p> <p>And on Wednesday, comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rich-hall\">Rich Hall</a> began his new series, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b080z2zd/broadcasts/upcoming\"><strong>Rich Hall\u2019s (US Election) Breakdown</strong></a>. I could listen to Hall for ever. His laconic, hilarious intelligence and beautiful use of language is always a delight. And this standup show, recorded in front of an audience in Washington DC, didn\u2019t disappoint. He dealt his blows even-handedly. Clinton is \u201ca cyborg, void of emotion, held together by rivets\u201d. Trump has \u201call the appeal of a rancid Mac and cheese fermenting in a hot dumpster\u201d. Whoever wins, it will be, said Hall, a historic decision. \u201cWe\u2019re about to elect the first woman president,\u201d he said. \u201cOr the first last president.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>M y eye was caught by a Kickstarter campaign for a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theswon/swon-the-smart-device-that-conserves-shower-water\" title=\"\">gizmo called a SWON</a>, described as \u201ca connected conservation device for your shower\u201d. You unscrew the shower head, screw on the SWON and then screw the head back on to it. From then on, water goes through the SWON before it reaches you. The Kickstarter campaign needs $50,000 to be pledged before the product can be made. Last time I checked, it had 75 backers and had raised pledges of $4,798.</p> <p>Before consigning it to the \u201cleading-edge uselessness\u201d bin, I clicked on the link. This triggered a video spiel in which four twentysomething hipsters straight out of central casting (male, baseball caps, black T-shirts \u2013 you know the rigmarole) explain why the gizmo is such a good idea. Apparently, every minute a hipster spends in the shower uses 2.5 gallons of water. \u201cThis is why,\u201d says the lead geek, \u201cI created SWON, an IoT device that installs in under one minute.\u201d It will save its users \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d in utility costs, and between 4,000 and 10,000 gallons of water a year, which in drought-stricken Silicon Valley is obviously quite a big deal.</p> <p>Impressive, eh? But wait a minute \u2013 did he say \u201c<em>an IoT device\u201d</em>? As in internet of things? Yep, he did. There\u2019s a smartphone app that tells a hipster how long he\u2019s spent in the cubicle and how much each shower costs in utility bills. He can set his desired shower time so that the gizmo beeps when his time is up. He can even specify the ideal water temperature so he knows when to step into the shower. \u201cAnd lastly,\u201d says the pitch man, \u201cthis is an IoT device, which means that it connects to your home\u2019s Wi-Fi network and can connect with other connected devices.\u201d</p> <p>You do wonder, when you encounter this kind of thing, what these people have been smoking. In their eagerness to clamber on to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/10/internet-of-things-better-made-things-smart-devices-security\" title=\"\">internet of things bandwagon</a>, they appear to have checked their brains at the door. They have forgotten that there is no such thing as a totally secure networked device, with the result that our homes, offices and, increasingly, our streets are being equipped with networked devices that are chronically insecure, ie vulnerable to hacking.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/brian-krebs-ddos-attack-google-protection-cybercrime\" title=\"\"> the colossal DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) attack</a> that had driven Brian Krebs, one of the world\u2019s foremost anti-cybercrime investigators, offline. \u201cWhat was new about the Krebs attack,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2016/1015.html\" title=\"\">wrote Bruce Schneier</a>, a leading cybersecurity expert, \u201cwas both the massive scale and the particular devices the attackers recruited. Instead of using traditional computers for their botnet, they used CCTV cameras, digital video recorders, home routers and other embedded computers attached to the internet as part of the internet of things.\u201d</p> <p>What this attack demonstrates, Schneier says, is that the economics of the IoT mean that it will remain insecure unless government steps in to fix the problem. \u201cThis is a market failure,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat can\u2019t get fixed on its own.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/oct/21/virtual-reality-changing-sport-game-nfl-nba\">Virtual reality and sport: breaking ground on and off the pitch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s right. Computer companies such as Apple and Microsoft go to great pains to try and ensure that the desktop and laptop computers they sell are protected from malware and that vulnerabilities are patched as soon as possible after they are discovered. But none of that happens with IoT devices, which are sold at razor-thin profit margins and are usually built by smallish Chinese and Taiwanese companies that don\u2019t possess the expertise (or the incentive) to make them secure. What makes it even worse, though, is that most of the IoT devices currently installed in homes cannot be patched. As Schneier says: \u201cThe only way for you to update the firmware in your home router is to throw it away and buy a new one.\u201d</p> <p>So here we have a market failure on a global scale: billions of insecure, vulnerable networked devices whose owners or manufacturers have no incentive to fix. There\u2019s only one institution that could deal with this \u2013 it\u2019s called government, but at the moment no government seems to be interested in it.</p> <p>Which brings us back to SWON. One doesn\u2019t doubt the sincerity or idealism of the guys behind it. Showering is indeed an incredibly wasteful habit. Even in the UK it\u2019s a problem. In 2011, for example,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15836433\" title=\"\"> a Unilever survey</a> showed that the average British shower lasts eight minutes and uses almost as much water and energy as the average bath. (For power showers you can double those numbers.)</p> <p>Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem and it doesn\u2019t involve installing a networked vulnerability in your home. Just spend less time in the&#xa0;shower. As Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign managers used to say: it\u2019s the economy, stoopid.</p>",
  "<p>How much short-term damage was inflicted by the Brexit vote will be revealed this week when we get an official GDP figure covering July, August and September.</p> <p>Back in the spring and early summer, Britain\u2019s national income was expanding at a healthy annual rate of 2.5%. The latest figures could show that this figure has halved and most forecasters expect next year to be no better.</p> <p>One of the supposed benefits of pulling out of the European Union \u2013 a low pound \u2013 has duly happened and sterling is around 18% lower against the dollar than it was before the referendum. This benefit is mostly reaped by exporters, who overnight find their goods cost less abroad and can therefore sell more of them.</p> <p>In the short term, though, there is a cost that kicks in before the export benefits can be realised, and that is higher import prices. Already petrol costs more than it did in June. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\" title=\"\">Marmite war between Tesco and Unilever</a> revealed there are plenty of tweaks to prices in the pipeline. There is a range of forecasts for next year\u2019s inflation rate of between 2% and 3%, up from 1% last month.</p> <p>Higher inflation, stagnant wages and slowing growth usually goes under the name stagflation. It\u2019s not a very friendly term and it\u2019s not supposed to be. It was coined in the 1970s and was supposed to remain tied to that decade, never to be repeated.</p> <p>It\u2019s like going to work with a heavy cold with the added anxiety that it might turn out to be flu. Productivity stays low and output declines.</p> <p>Unemployment, for so long the measure of Britain\u2019s jobs miracle alongside record employment figures, has started to rise. Stagflation could turn the August increase in the jobless total of 24,000 into a six figure total, with all the pain that unemployment brings.</p> <p>A 24,000 rise is the equivalent to a third of the workers in a town like Guildford, or half the number in Selby, North Yorkshire, being made redundant. More than 100,000 extra people on the dole is the same as putting Wolverhampton\u2019s entire workforce out&#xa0;of a job.</p> <p>This is an alarming thought, and not one a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/18/unemployment-public-sector-strikes\" title=\"\">government has had to consider since 2011,</a> when unemployment climbed to 2.86 million, or 8.4% of the workforce. It is now 1.66 million and the jobless rate is 4.9%.</p> <p>The Brexit vote has certainly played its part in dampening the enthusiasm of businesses to invest. Other factors have played a part, though, and they could turn a year of grey skies, economically speaking, into one where it rains all the time.</p> <p>The US economy is faltering after a year of sluggish manufacturing and construction output. Like Britain, the consumer has provided the main prop for GDP growth, but increasingly people are hanging on to their cash rather than spending it.</p> <p>Investment decisions are being delayed while firms cope with the high value of the dollar, which is hampering export growth. Around 17% of British exports go to the US, which is why the UK receives a cold blast from across the Atlantic when American businesses catch a chill.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve appears ready to disregard the fall in American growth \u2013 from 4% in 2015 to 2% this year and possibly to zero in 2017 \u2013 and make a further increase in interest rates. It is waiting until the election is over before making its move, but the warning signs are there.</p> <p>It has all the hallmarks of a disastrous decision that, for the sake of central bank dogma, will push the economy into recession.</p> <p>Britain, despite the best efforts of its own central bank, has already suffered from a downturn in global trade. A crippled US economy can only make that situation worse, adding to the pall cast by the looming exit from the European Union.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac4559b08fc763bbff1d943a0ba0d2aa3386f886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac4559b08fc763bbff1d943a0ba0d2aa3386f886/0_124_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under scrutiny: the Hermes parcel delivery company\u2019s distribution base off the M62 at Burtonwood, Cheshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Plague of bogus self-employment</h2> <p>Self-employment is the new outsourcing. At its most benign, the outsourcing of work to freelancers and contractors, facilitated by the internet, offers a chance to fit work around lifestyles and abandon the drudge of commuting. But for many of the 4.8 million self-employed people in the UK, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/hmrc-launch-crackdown-gig-economy-firms-agency-self-employed-staff\" title=\"\">gig economy</a>\u201d is little more than exploitation \u2013 and anyone who makes a fuss can wave goodbye to an already very uncertain income.</p> <p>Latest <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/latest\" title=\"\">UK labour market figures</a> show that 48% of jobs created from June to August this year were in self-employed roles. How many of these were disguised employees, hired through agencies, or, as allegedly in the case of delivery company Hermes \u2013 although it denies this \u2013 full-time staff, but without the benefits and legal protection that brings?</p> <p>HMRC has launched a specialist unit to investigate companies that opt out of giving workers employment protection by using agencies or calling staff self-employed. Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/frank-field\" title=\"\">Frank Field</a> says Theresa May\u2019s government is showing a real willingness to grapple with this problem.</p> <p>But how rigorous will a clampdown be? In January, millions will submit personal tax returns. Those who miss the deadline will be fined. Much more seriously, individuals who lie on their return, concealing income or deliberately understating their position, can be fined up to 200% of the extra tax due, and get a potential criminal record. They could end up behind bars.</p> <p>Companies found to be using bogus self-employment to save on national insurance, pensions and holiday pay should face the same aggressive intervention. On paper, HMRC has the power to pursue businesses for historic and current PAYE deductions and to impose hefty fines. But there appears to have been a reluctance to take on big companies. Until the fines are more meaningful \u2013 say 10 times the amount of tax avoided \u2013 the law more rigorously enforced, and directors potentially hit with a criminal record \u2013 the plague of bogus self-employment will continue.</p> <h2>Green is not the only man to blame</h2> <p>Not for the first time in 2016, Sir Philip Green has had a bad week. He started it by making a plea to save his knighthood by saying he was \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d about the collapse of BHS, that he had made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d in selling the department store chain to Dominic Chappell and that he was still working on a deal to rescue the company\u2019s beleaguered pension scheme.</p> <p>However, MPs still voted to strip Green of his knighthood and he was labelled a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d, among many other things, in a heated debate in the House of Commons.</p> <p>Green deserves to be scrutinised for his stewardship of BHS, but the furore around the billionaire tycoon must not overshadow the other serious issues that have emerged from this scandal, such as the regulation of pension schemes, the role of advisers in mergers and acquisitions, and the behaviour of Chappell and his consortium Retail Acquisitions, which, at best, could be described as incompetent.</p>",
  "<p>Tom and Mary Carroll raised nine children in their modest council house in Little Hulton, Salford. When daughter Maria was born with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/downs-syndrome\">Down\u2019s syndrome</a>, her siblings would occasionally have to run down to the shops to have a word with local scallywags teasing her.

They chose another of Maria\u2019s paintings, of the Madonna and child, to adorn the last Happy Mondays album, <em>Yes, Please</em>. Matt can\u2019t remember whether the band was aware the picture was Maria\u2019s work. He texts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shaun-ryder\">Shaun Ryder</a> to check. \u201cHe just got back and says, \u201cYes, we all knew it was Maria\u2019s artwork and were very proud to have it as a cover.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago Matt and Maria began working on pictures together, often starting with an idea Maria had begun on an iPad. \u201cIt became obvious that to collaborate and create something together would be special.

You will love it.\u201d Oh dear. If there\u2019s one way to guarantee I\u2019ll hate something, it\u2019s by telling me I\u2019m going to love it. Don\u2019t you dare tell me what to feel before I\u2019ve felt it. Don\u2019t you dare try to force me to have a good time. I don\u2019t do enforced jollity.

I could well imagine some people might actually love its food, less a style of cooking than a form of gastronomic bare-knuckle fighting in which the shoutiest ingredient wins. It\u2019s food which can\u2019t spell the word \u201csubtle\u201d let alone express it. The problem is one of accumulation; of different but curiously similar flavours piling up, one atop the other, until they begin to topple. But it took time for me to get there, as it will for you.</p> <p>Foley\u2019s belongs to Mitz Vora, a former sous chef at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/12/the-palomar-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Palomar</a>, the Jerusalem-born restaurant over in Soho which has turned counter eating into performance theatre, complete with cooks breaking into song and offering shots to the diners. There may well be an element of that at Foley\u2019s because downstairs in the basement is a Palomar-style open kitchen with a dining counter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6e314e6d65f7c6f63e9620dc3d46765f39709b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6e314e6d65f7c6f63e9620dc3d46765f39709b5/0_354_5060_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Going wild: charcoal-grilled cauliflower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going wild: charcoal-grilled cauliflower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously I didn\u2019t know anything about it until I went for a loo break. I found another dining room full of glossy-haired young people having a fine old time. Clearly the staff took one look at us and decided we were not suitable for the counter. They didn\u2019t even mention its existence. Instead they directed us to the subdued space upstairs, where bass lines thunder and chatter bounces off the brick walls, which were only slightly more distressed than we were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa8d6203774a31e9a00bfcb541348df4bd81dff9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8d6203774a31e9a00bfcb541348df4bd81dff9/0_302_5232_3140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Salty and crisp and compelling\u2019: chicken burnt ends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Salty and crisp and compelling\u2019: chicken burnt ends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Palomar the food plays fast and loose with the culinary traditions of the Middle East. Hummus and fattoush make a showing. At Foley\u2019s, which takes its name from its London street address, the kitchen plays fast and loose with the culinary traditions of just about everywhere. The menu references India and Japan, China and Greece, Thailand, the Middle East and Indonesia. It\u2019s an over-funded gap year of a menu; the sort that could only really exist in a multi-ethnic city at ease with itself.</p> <p>The curious thing is that taken dish by dish, it works. Peanut crackers, both crumbly and savoury, come with a lightly spiced tomato sambal, which tastes like ketchup\u2019s filthier cousin; the one who learned to smoke and drink before you did. It\u2019s the first appearance of peanuts. If you like peanuts don\u2019t worry. More will be along later.</p> <p>A dish called \u201ccharcoal grilled chicken burnt ends\u201d references the pork rib tips of American barbecue that always end up a little darker than the rest of the meat. These are nothing of the sort, of course, because the ends of chicken ribs would be like Q-tips. These are skin-on pieces of thigh, drenched in a Korean-style marinade and fired up. They are smoky and dark, salty and crisp and compelling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b306d3053716ba8d0baa2dfe6eea0ce782625f0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b306d3053716ba8d0baa2dfe6eea0ce782625f0b/0_294_5260_3156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Full of smoked peanuts\u2019: market salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Full of smoked peanuts\u2019: market salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cauliflower has also had a good time in the flames, before being dumped on a tzatziki bed, smeared with a pungent tomato relish and pelted with smoked peanuts for crunch. The textural contrasts are fun. It feels like the kitchen has ticked off a list that reads: \u201csalty, sweet, sour, crunchy\u201d. Along comes a \u201cmarket salad\u201d full of sprouted greens, and acidulated cubes of cucumber, sour slices of granny smith apple, butter milk and \u2013 oh look! \u2013 our old friend smoked peanuts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"014728caf61452494a0c56a074ee6e7308eea638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/014728caf61452494a0c56a074ee6e7308eea638/0_307_5220_3131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018More bloody peanuts\u2019: sticky beef.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018More bloody peanuts\u2019: sticky beef.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both of these dishes are striking, but both seem built in exactly the same way. The issue becomes more pronounced with the meat side of the menu. A long-cooked piece of short rib, glazed with something salty and sweet, comes with a Thai-inspired salad of spiralised daikon and cucumber, with crispy shallots and more bloody peanuts. The description of the pork belly dish makes it sound entirely different. It\u2019s \u201cTamarind BBQ, apple, green papaya, buttermilk, cured red onions\u201d.</p> <p>This one doesn\u2019t have peanuts. Oh no. Nothing of the sort. It has toasted cashews. So that\u2019s a sweet-salty glazed bit of meat, with a sour-crisp salad and more nuts. I find myself imagining Vora standing back from each dish as it was created and muttering \u201cWhat this dish needs is nuts!\u201d and then hurling handfuls of them at the plate. Even an octopus dish ends up tasting like the beef and pork dishes. That\u2019s quite an achievement. The hunks of tentacle are slow cooked and charred and served with crisped bits of pork mince, an intense black sesame mayo and their own chilli sauce.</p> <p>Individually each dish really does deliver a thrilling whack. These are big unashamed flavours, with a serious come-hither pout. They\u2019re also well priced, with most around a tenner or less. Perhaps if I popped in for lunch and had a couple to myself it would be fine. But tasting six in a row starts to feel like being shouted at repeatedly by the kitchen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a777358dc95c142a05f88d579521839ee311a88c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a777358dc95c142a05f88d579521839ee311a88c/0_272_5332_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018All bravado\u2019: Fatboy Elvis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All bravado\u2019: Fatboy Elvis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dessert offers a \u201cFatboy Elvis\u201d but it\u2019s all bravado. There are little pieces of chocolate chip sponge fizzing with bicarb and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 peanut honeycomb. Well of course. There\u2019s also something called \u201cbacon crack\u201d, which sounds like it\u2019s applying to be my drug of choice. It turns out to be bacon-flavoured popping candy and less than addictive. Far better are crisp leaves of honeyed filo with crushed caramelised nuts, under a glorious cloud of cardamom-flavoured cream. They could have called it a deconstructed baklava. I thank them for not doing so.</p> <p>And all this served by one waitress who keeps begging us to tell her which dish is our favourite, and another who asks if she can \u201ctempt\u201d us to another bottle of sparkling water. I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019ve had more tempting offers. It\u2019s service which puts the \u201cplease make it stop\u201d into solicitous. The dessert menu also includes an invitation to purchase a \u201csix pack for the chefs\u201d. Yup, for \u00a36 you can buy the cooks a beer to drink after work. Really? I thought I was already seeing the cooks right by, y\u2019know, paying for the dishes and the 12.5% service charge. Chalk that one up in the column headed \u201cchutzpah\u201d. Foley\u2019s isn\u2019t a bad restaurant. It isn\u2019t a terrible way to spend your money or your time. Some people might even love it. I just doubt I\u2019ll ever be one of them.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Maray</strong> in Liverpool takes a similar global approach to Foley\u2019s, but is a little more successful for corralling the various regional influences within each plate rather than across them.

Kitchen commissions led to living rooms, to offices, bedrooms, a shop, each project continuing their modernist aesthetic, their passion for plywood. \u201cBut really,\u201d adds Hoy, \u201cAll we are is a set of details.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This weekend marks four months since the country voted to leave the European Union and there is as yet no consensus on how we progress. We are a nation stuck in an impasse, where a language and culture of intolerance are beginning to emerge. Left unchecked, this could take us to a place where neither Leave nor Remain voters intended us to go.</p> <p>Theresa May must take her share of responsibility for this. Her approach to Brexit has been chaotic, at best. The lack of a strong vision has created a vacuum. And into this vacuum have stepped the hardliners, imposing on the result their own narrative, deciding what the British people really meant. Not all those who voted to leave voted for a hard Brexit. We all know the reality is far more nuanced. Moderate voices have felt attacked and pushed out. As a result, the tone and dialogue in our public spaces online and offline is changing. Intolerance, fear and insecurity are on the rise.</p> <p>Last week, I asked a range of people across the country and in my local community what they felt, now we are four months on. What came back did not make for light reading. \u201cLanguage used by people who were Brexiters has become much more aggressive,\u201d said one. Another: \u201cI saw a woman approached by a man on the street who shouted, \u2018Are you going to go home now you \u2013 we voted you out.\u2019\u201d One headteacher said: \u201cThe day after the vote, for the first time in three years, our year 2 pupils were racially abused outside with \u2018Go back home\u2019.\u201d Another said: \u201cThe elephant in the room is the incessant and systematic bullying, berating and gagging of a huge portion of our society, people who voted to remain and who still believe that in a democracy they should continue to have a voice in what happens next.\u201d</p> <p>The post-Brexit debate is becoming less reasoned, more toxic and more intolerant. Last week could have offered a chink of light. Theresa May faced her first electoral test and it did not go well. She pounded the streets and knocked on doors of this safe Tory part of Oxfordshire alongside David Cameron. The results of her campaigning? T<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority\" title=\"\">he Conservatives\u2019 majority was slashed</a> by nearly 20,000 votes.</p> <p>Could this be a turning point? As the three Brexiters hurtle towards hard Brexit without a thought for casualties, perhaps, just perhaps, Witney could be the wake-up call for May that we need.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a child from an Asian family I expected to be spat at or have something  thrown at me. I thought those days were over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A nation of division, intolerance, lower living standards and a slowing economy is not what people voted for. Growth has been revised down, the pound has fallen to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78478eee-e170-32d3-bdbb-b88a98f2f9bd\" title=\"\">168-year low</a>, inflation is on the rise. Around 40% of our household shopping basket is imported. As food prices rise, families on low incomes will be increasingly squeezed and hit the hardest. As May puts her party politics ahead of our economy and national interest, people are starting to notice.</p> <p>Language matters and political rhetoric has consequences. The public mood can change quickly. We have a responsibility to watch the way we speak over the next years and how we talk about Britain\u2019s future. It is not a coincidence that racist or religious hate crime incidents recorded have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/hate-crimes-eu-referendum-home-office-figures-confirm\" title=\"\">risen by 41%</a> in the aftermath of the referendum. It is a consequence.</p> <p>Something terribly unBritish is developing and it is damaging our social fabric and our image abroad. It is so very far removed from the Britain we have known for the last generation. We have built up a strong reputation as an outward-looking country and a global player. The debate after the referendum \u2013 more than the vote itself \u2013 is what may irrevocably destroy this reputation.</p> <p>Amber Rudd\u2019s call for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\" title=\"\">register of foreign workers</a> and her misguided speech at the Tory conference at a time when we need, more than ever, to come together and work collaboratively with so many issues on the world stage was highly irresponsible.</p> <p>Yet any challenge to this narrative can result in calls that question our patriotism. When it comes to Brexit, like anything else, it is vital for our democracy that we should be able to challenge and scrutinise. If parliamentarians raise concerns about the challenges ahead and stand up for the interests of voters, we are, it\u2019s said, \u201cundemocratic\u201d. But voices of moderation or inclusion should not be frozen out. There is not only one way to Brexit.</p> <p>Last week, Theresa May called for Britain to still have a central role in Europe until we leave. That\u2019s welcome but, sadly, three months late. Because of her choice not to speak earlier, our MEPs doing important work on tax avoidance and other issues have already started to find themselves sidelined. And now that sidelining has extended to May herself \u2013 she cut an isolated figure as she was given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\" title=\"\">five minutes to speak on Brexit at 1am</a>.</p> <p>In my 20 years of political activism, I cannot remember a time when we had such an unshared sense of who we are as a nation. Just four years ago, we stood together side by side as our nation hosted one of the most successful Olympics ever, our winning ticket being a message of openness, pride in our diversity and confidence in our place in the world. Mo Farah became a national hero, a young Somalian who had come to Britain as a refugee and grown up, like me, in Feltham, west London.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to believe that a young Mo Farah would today have the same chances and be able to serve his country, But with the language currently heard around child refugees, it does make me wonder. We are a nation with a bigger heart and a bigger purpose. It\u2019s not too late to correct the course we are on. But it has to start at the top. It has to start with Theresa May.</p>",

So ferocious is the reckoning of the child to the adult, the history to the present, the individual to what is global, that when the poem is, finally, performed, the effect is a roll of thunder from the stage, a summoned storm.</p> <p>I have never experienced anything quite like it in the theatre, and days out from the performance I am still electric with its impact. Such effects are only possible with the technical flawlessness of artists at the height of their self-realisation, and gratitude is due to Holloway not merely for programming Lepage, but programming 887 within a complement of others that affirm and nuance a broader conversation about these subjects and their value. </p>",

Time Warner\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bewkes, says he expects all of his company\u2019s creative and business executives to stay on \u201cfor a number of years\u201d. </p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee said on Saturday he would block the deal if he were elected. In <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/donald-trump-gettysburg-contract-with-america-sue-accusers-hillary-clinton\">a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>, Donald Trump said AT&amp;T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner would give the combined group \u201ctoo much concentration of power\u201d and would \u201cdestroy democracy\u201d. </p> <p>Speaking about his continuing battle with the \u201cdishonest mainstream media\u201d, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people.</p> <p>\u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said he would also consider \u201cbreaking\u201d up the last big media deal, Comcast\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/13/comcast-general-electric-nbc-universal-rockefeller-plaza?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+%28Media%29\">acquisition of NBC Universal in 2013</a>. \u201cDeals like this destroy democracy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Telecoms companies are increasingly seeking to buy into cable TV providers and content producers, in order to offer more extensive packages to consumers. AT&amp;T spent $48bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/att-directv-takeover-deal\">buying the satellite TV provider DirecTV</a> last year, making it the country\u2019s largest pay-TV provider, with 25 million customers. The company has also spent hundreds of millions improving its infrastructure to give consumers a better experience watching video content on their mobile phones. </p> <p>Buying Time Warner would give AT&amp;T, which has a market value of $226bn, access to the Harry Potter and Batman film franchises as well as hit TV shows such as The Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones. </p> <p>The rival telecoms company Verizon is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/can-verizons-bid-for-yahoo-survive\">in negotiations to buy Yahoo</a> and has already bought AOL, owner of the Huffington Post.</p> <p>The AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal vindicates Bewkes\u2019s, decision to turn down a $85-a-share takeover approach from 21st Century Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/24/rupert-murdoch-time-warner\">two years ago</a>. Shares in Time Warner jumped 8% to $89.48 on Friday, when speculation about the proposed deal was first reported.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pvtl.com/team/\">Brian Wieser</a>, lead researcher at the analytics firm Pivotal, said the deal would present the new entity with potentially insurmountable difficulties.</p> <p>Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at first look similar to the successful Comcast, following its purchase of NBC Universal, an AT&amp;T-Time Warner entity would present unique challenges. Other entities, he said, made more sense for the always-a-bridesmaid Time Warner. </p> <p>\u201cDirecTV and Time Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and AT&amp;T,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like a hedge against the commoditization of infrastructure.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/can-verizons-bid-for-yahoo-survive\">Verizon's bid for Yahoo on the rocks ahead of latest revenue results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cash-rich telecoms companies such as AT&amp;T are facing a crisis as their wireless businesses reach maturity and fixed-line income continues to erode.</p> <p>\u201cAT&amp;T is an acquisition machine and interested in empire preservation if nothing else,\u201d said Wieser. </p> <p>\u201cTime Warner has always been for sale at the right price. It\u2019s not a position that creates any synergies and it does create some dis-synergies, like the problem of managing a global media company from Texas. It\u2019s a standalone entity that gets lost when it\u2019s part of a much bigger conglomerate.\u201d</p> <p>AT&amp;T faces tough choices, said Wieser: \u201cIf the prospects for wireline growth are negative and the prospects for wireless growth tepid, what do you do to make sure your business grows?\u201d </p> <p>Time Warner, too, faces problems. The trend of \u201ccord-cutting\u201d \u2013 people getting TV over the internet \u2013 has eaten into the cable subscriptions that are vital to its networks. </p> <p>There is also increasing competition from players such Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google\u2019s YouTube. In August, Time Warner bought a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu.</p>"
