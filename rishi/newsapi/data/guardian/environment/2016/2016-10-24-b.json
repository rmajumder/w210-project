  "<p>Renee Wootton didn\u2019t set out to smash any stereotypes, she just wanted to find friends when she moved to live with her grandparents in Marlee, a small town on the mid north coast of New South Wales.</p> <p>But when she joined the Australian Air Force Cadets as a teen, she discovered a passion for aircraft that led her to a career in aerospace engineering \u2013 an unusual choice for a woman, especially one with an Indigenous background.</p> <p>Wootton, now 23, is in the graduate program at Qantas with an honours degree under her belt, thanks to her own hard work and dedication and a number of programs that gave her a helping hand.</p> <p>Putting to one side the dearth of female engineers (around 14% of enrolments), the number of Indigenous students who enrol in Stem courses (science, technology, engineering and maths) is tiny \u2013 fewer than 1%. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/atsiheac_background_paper_stem.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">represent around 1.4%</a> (pdf) of all university enrolments. Around 3% of the Australian population is Indigenous. </p> <p>This absence from Stem is locking them out of some of the most rewarding and high-paying jobs. Of fast-growing occupations, 75% require Stem skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/17/autistic-employees-can-give-companies-an-edge-in-innovative-thinking\">Autistic employees can give companies an edge in innovative thinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wootton says she had a drive to achieve: \u201cFor me, I didn\u2019t have a family that stuck together. My parents divorced early on and Mum never really had a steady job \u2013 so that was a life I didn\u2019t want for myself\u201d.</p> <p>Once Wootton discovered her love for aircraft engines, she took extra tutoring at school to try to get the marks she needed to get to university.</p> <p>The aerospace engineering course at the University of NSW required an ATAR score of 93. Wootton achieved 80.71, but was awarded entry into an alternative pathway for Indigenous students, via a diploma in science, engineering and technology. After a year, she was able to transfer to the degree course.</p> <p>In Sydney, she joined a mentoring and support service for Indigenous university students, CareerTrackers, which placed her in an internship at Qantas. </p> <p>Qantas group executive of brand, marketing and corporate affairs, Olivia Wirth, says around <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reconciliation.org.au/raphub/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reconciliation-action-plan-2015-2018.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">1% (317 people)</a> of the airline\u2019s employees are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background.</p> <p>Qantas is working towards a target of 1.5% by 2018 and, once it achieves that, will continue to keep increasing the proportion, she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the national carrier and that has a lot of meaning.

Qantas will provide a minimum of 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander internships over 10 years, with 100 Indigenous internships over the first three years.</p> <p>Wirth says the airline has a focus on getting diversity in the people employed in its Stem roles, which include pilots and engineers, and Indigenous people have been part of that.</p> <p>Michael Combs is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.careertrackers.org.au/ \" rel=\"nofollow\">CareerTrackers</a>, now in its seventh year, and says 94% of its interns <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hcamag.com/hr-news/indigenous-interns-soaring-says-careertrackers-report-216982.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">graduate</a> from university (compared with the 40% of Indigenous students not in the program). </p> <p>Combs credits this success rate to the sense of community, mutual support and accountability generated among the interns.</p> <p>Combs says around 200 CareerTrackers students are doing Stem degrees and are being recruited by a wide range of companies which are looking for the \u201cStem way of thinking\u201d.</p> <p>Australian software company Atlassian is looking for ways to employ more people of Indigenous background and has so far hosted one intern through CareerTrackers last summer. \u201cHe was a first-year IT student at uni and he was so great that we are bringing him back for a second internship,\u201d says head of diversity, Aubrey Blanche.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/10/gender-diversity-at-work-using-education-to-tackle-the-backlash\">Gender diversity at work: using education to tackle the backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is definitely a partnership we are looking at continuing in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the CSIRO and BHP Billiton Foundation launched the $28.8m Indigenous Stem education program. This ambitious five-year project has the twin aims of encouraging Indigenous students into Stem careers, while integrating traditional Indigenous science into school curricula.</p> <p>The project director of the Indigenous Stem education program, Therese Postma, says integrating Indigenous content into schools\u2019 science classes is a way of engaging the interest of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.</p> <p>\u201cThere is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1290&amp;context=research_conference\" rel=\"nofollow\">literature</a> that says Indigenous students are slightly more interested in science than non-Indigenous students,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cI think that links back to [the fact] there are still a lot who are working on the land and that links to responsibilities, what their family do, culturally, and cultural practices.\u201d</p> <p>This program also runs <a href=\"http://www.csiro.au/en/Education/Programs/Indigenous-STEM\" rel=\"nofollow\">free summer schools</a> for year 10 Indigenous students, across the country. \u201cThe feedback we have had from those summer schools has been that students have come there thinking they might be a bricklayer in their community \u2013 and have left thinking they can be an engineer,\u201d says Postma.</p> <p>They can then take part in a leadership program, which supports them through the rest of their high school years and provides workplace opportunities in Stem areas.</p> <p>Students are also offered a place in a Melbourne University-run bachelor of science, which is extended an extra year to four years so that young people who may face greater challenges in a tertiary education environment have time to get up to speed.</p> <p>These university students are not required to qualify by their Atar score, but are accepted for their passion and interest in the subject. It is hoped that, at the end of the five years of BHP Billiton foundation funding, many of the elements of the program will have become self-sustaining and that funding can be found for the rest.</p> <p>Aboriginal-owned business, Indigi Lab, <a href=\"http://www.indigilab.com.au/what-is-indigenous-science/\" rel=\"nofollow\">promotes Indigenous science,</a> while also encouraging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to take up Stem careers.

  "<p>Women have caught up with men in the amount of alcohol they drink and are doing increasing amounts of damage to their health as a result, according to a global study that looked at the consumption habits of four million people over a period of over a century.</p> <p>The change is partly the result of successful marketing campaigns and the creation of sweeter products aimed at young women or girls, as well as cuts in price, say health campaigners.

Alcohol use and alcohol-use disorders have historically been viewed as a male phenomenon. The present study calls this assumption into question and suggests that young women in particular should be the target of concerted efforts to reduce the impact of substance use and related harms,\u201d they say.</p> <p>Their analysis, <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011827\">published in the journal BMJ Open</a>, looks at the convergence of drinking habits between men and women over time, from 1891 to 2014. It pools the results of 68 international studies, published since 1980, to look at the changing ratio of male to female drinking over the years.</p> <p>Historically, far more men drank alcohol than women. Men born between 1891 and 1910 were twice as likely as their female peers to drink alcohol and more than three times as likely to be involved in problematic use or use leading to harms. But in all three respects, this had almost reached parity among those born between 1991 and 2000.</p> <p>Women\u2019s drinking has increased for a number of reasons. Those who have succeeded in obtaining jobs that were once the preserve of men have joined \u2013 or found it necessary to become part of \u2013 the after-work drinking culture. Office for National Statistics figures from 2011 show that women in management and professional jobs drink more than the average woman and drink more on weekdays.</p> <p>But drops in the price, which have led to wine and beer becoming regular items in the supermarket shopping trolley and part of everyday life at home, have also been a factor, alongside deliberate marketing targeted at women.</p> <p>\u201cSince the 1950s we\u2019ve seen women\u2019s drinking continue to rise,\u201d said Emily Robinson, director of campaigns at Alcohol Concern. \u201cDrinking at home has continued to increase and because alcohol is so cheap and easily available it\u2019s become an everyday grocery item.

But she warned that there was no safe limit for anybody.</p> <p>Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: \u201cHistorically women did not drink that much. There has definitely been a proactive effort to entice women to drink more.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some of the drinks now available have been targeted at young women who \u201cpre-load\u201d while getting together to dress and do their make-up before a night out. Three large glasses of wine can be the equivalent of nine units, she added.</p> <p>Babycham was the first drink specifically designed with women in mind in post-war Britain.

With a Lambrini tailored to complement your own personal style and taste, you\u2019re going to love our new collection!\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.lambrini.co.uk/\">the advertising on its website</a>. </p> <p>Alcohol advertising and sponsorship is also noticeable in TV programmes aimed at women. For example, Baileys backed Desperate Housewives.</p> <p>Women\u2019s bodies do not tolerate alcohol as well as men\u2019s, however, because they have a higher fat to water ratio. Because they have less water, the alcohol in their system remains more concentrated. They also have smaller livers than men, which makes it harder to process alcohol safely.</p>",

Their statement says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our team on the ground have informed us that The Home Office have not been allowed to register children today. As such, the most vulnerable group, the under 13\u2019s (who would qualify under the Alf Dubs amendment) are being forced to remain in the Calais camp itself amidst all the confusion and chaos. </p> <p>Our latest census shows there are 49 unaccompanied children in the Calais camp who are 13 years old or under. All are eligible under the Dubs amendment for resettlement in the UK. There are also many unaccompanied girls remaining in camp who are eligible to come to the UK but who were not registered over the weekend.</p> <p>The shipping containers on site in the Calais camp were emptied of residents at 7am this morning, on the understanding that unaccompanied minors would be housed there until they were properly processed (either sent to the UK under Dubs or family reunification, or suitable accommodation was found for them in France). </p> <p>However, the minors already living in the containers were also asked to vacate this morning. Some of the children are being asked to go to the warehouse for registration to queue up to then be sent back to the containers. Others are being told registration has stopped for the day. </p> <p>This chaotic set up is extremely distressing and confusing for the lone minors, the youngest of which is 8 years old (according to our last census). The younger children are struggling to understand where they are supposed to go, and how they are supposed to get there.</p> <p>Up to a thousand children are expected to be housed in the shipping containers and at present it appears there is nothing in the way of youth workers or social workers to be responsible for, and help calm these young people and children.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T13:47:44.850Z\">at 2.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580e0f51e4b0c146d5891444\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T13:41:46.776Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In case you were wondering how long people have been waiting to get into processing centres and on to buses away from Calais, this tweet by Michael Bochenek will enlighten you:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelBochenek/status/790525836336259072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These men from Sudan have been in line since 8am and are now reaching the gate at the warehouse front. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Calais?src=hash\">#Calais</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fOGr4Qbqsz\">pic.twitter.com/fOGr4Qbqsz</a></p>&mdash; Michael Bochenek (@MichaelBochenek) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelBochenek/status/790525836336259072\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580e0d0fe4b024af0e451aa9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T13:31:54.033Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Geoffrey Cox QC</strong>, MP for Torridge and West Devon, has welcomed the arrival of the refugees in Devon.

They are worried France won\u2019t grant them asylum because it doesn\u2019t recognise them as persecuted, based on the experience of others who have been rejected.</em></p> <p><em>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said everyone in the Calais camp would be offered the chance to be transferred to a reception centre where they could apply for asylum. </em><em>\u201cThere will be no blanket decisions for certain nationalities,\u201d spokeswoman Laura Padoan said.</em></p> <p><em>French asylum chief Pascal Brice recently visited the Jungle and offered reassurances to the migrants and refugees, including the Oromo group, said Solan. </em><em>Brice was not available for comment when the Thomson Reuters Foundation contacted his office on Monday.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cIf they accept us we want to stay here (in France),\u201d said Solan, who did not want to give his full name. \u201cWe are not searching for a better country, we are here (in Calais) because England accepts Oromo people.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>Solan has been moving back and forth between Calais and a makeshift migrant camp in Paris for the past year, he said.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s has been a very rapid attempt by the French and UK governments to do their homework on the back of the bus.

Under pressure from Britain, which sees it as having a \u201cpull\u201d effect on migration, the camp is closed in 2002. Hundreds of mainly Afghan migrants then set up camp east of Calais, on a patch of scrubland next to a road travelled by lorries heading for Calais port. The migrants call it \u201cthe Jungle\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>September 2009</strong>, the Jungle is demolished for the first time on the orders of then president Nicolas Sarkozy, following a mass police raid in which scores of people are arrested.<br></li> <li>In <strong>early 2015</strong>, a new settlement - labelled the \u201cNew Jungle\u201d - sprouts up near a state-run day centre for migrants established at the site. The camp later becomes simply known as the Jungle. <br></li> <li>From <strong>mid-2015 on</strong>, migrants attempting to board lorries or enter the Channel Tunnel frequently clash with police around the camp, which mushrooms in size as asylum-seekers pour into Europe in unprecedented numbers. That November, France\u2019s top administrative court rapped the government over conditions in the camp, describing them as \u201cinhuman\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>January 2016</strong>, the port of Calais is shut for more than three hours after dozens of migrants occupy a moored Britain-bound ferry. A month later, around 20 people are arrested in Calais at a banned rally by supporters of Germany\u2019s xenophobic Pegida movement.<br></li> <li>The southern half of the Jungle camp is demolished in late <strong>February 2016 and early March</strong>, sparking protests. Iranian migrants protesting at the destruction of their shacks sew their mouths shut. The evicted migrants moved to the northern part of the camp.<br></li> <li>On <strong>26 September</strong>, President Francois Hollande says the Jungle will be demolished by the end of the year and that the migrants - estimated to number around 6,000 - will be moved to shelters around the country.<br></li> <li>On <strong>October 21</strong> the interior ministry confirms the operation to tear down the camp will start on Monday, 24 October (today). Migrants began evacuating early in the morning, with the first bus carrying about 50 Sudanese leaving the Jungle at about 08:45 am (0645 GMT). <br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580de333e4b0c146d5891341\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:34:47.178Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">600 people bussed away from Calais camp by 11.30am</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">By 11:30, 600 refugees &amp; migrants had left by bus to places including burgundy, north eastern France, western France <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/calais?src=hash\">#calais</a></p>&mdash; Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:35:04.270Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580de2ade4b0ce434eca471c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:31:36.233Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our reporters have arrived back at the processing queues and say that all is now calm in the area.

I really worry that Britain left this far, far too late to do its bit in terms of helping the children and teenagers.

Once the clearances start, we know that there is a significant risk that many of those children and young people disappear.

He told Lisa: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am an educated person, why would I want to be in this camp? But I am. All my family are in the UK.

Airport expansion decision day \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two sources on the cabinet\u2019s airports subcommittee have told the Guardian they expect the group to back Heathrow, after it meets on Tuesday morning to make a final decision.</p> <p>Members of the nine-strong committee have been directed to make their decisions on the basis of the evidence of the Airports Commission, which was led by Sir Howard Davies. </p> <p>That put forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/23/overwhelming-case-for-heathrow-expansion-says-commission-chair\">two options for expanding at Heathrow and one at Gatwick</a>, before making a final recommendation for a third runway at Heathrow last year.</p> <p>The decision will be explained to MPs by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, at 12.30pm but is likely to emerge soon after the committee, chaired by May herself, has met earlier in the morning. </p> <p>Both the interim and final reports of the commission, in December 2013 and July 2015, were released at 7am as they were regarded as market sensitive.</p> <p>No 10 has been careful to say that expansion at either Heathrow or Gatwick is still on the table. However, speculation has been mounting in favour of Heathrow since May announced plans to allow ministers to speak out against the chosen option if they have a longstanding opposition and to delay holding a parliamentary vote for more than a year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/airport_options-zip/giv-140650CV7byeBOAH/\" data-alt=\"The options\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/airport_options-zip/giv-140650CV7byeBOAH/\">The options</a> </figure>  <p>This would allow Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to speak out against Heathrow if it is chosen for many months.</p> <p>If Heathrow is picked, it will mean a reversal in Conservative policy since David Cameron as opposition leader ruled out backing a third runway with \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d. </p> <p>Although ministers are likely to be happy with the compromise offered by May, a number of Conservative backbenchers would be furious with a decision in favour of Heathrow.</p> <p>The decision is likely to trigger a byelection at some point as Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond Park, is expected to resign and stand again as an independent. </p> <p>Tania Mathias, the Conservative MP for Twickenham, told the Guardian she did not feel that concerns about air quality and noise impact around Heathrow have been resolved since Cameron last year delayed a decision on a third runway to consider the environmental impact further.</p> <p>\u201cIf the decision is Heathrow, I do not think they can get through the public consultation and scrutiny,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be saying they cannot fudge their data now. I think it will mark the beginning of the end for any expansion to Heathrow.\u201d<br></p> <p>Grayling insisted this weekend that a decision had yet to be made between Heathrow and Gatwick. But the cabinet subcommittee, which excludes prominent opponents of Heathrow expansion, appears likely to follow the \u201cclear and unanimous\u201d recommendation of the Airports Commission in July 2015 to build a \u00a317.6bn runway by 2025. </p> <p>Gatwick, which still harbours slim hopes of getting the nod over Heathrow, has warned that its option is its own second runway plan or \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d, pointing to two recent instances \u2013 in 2003 and 2009 \u2013 when the government has approved a third runway at the west London hub without it being built. </p> <p>The West Sussex airport\u2019s chairman, Sir Roy McNulty, on Monday wrote to members of May\u2019s airports subcommittee in a last-ditch attempt to underline its claims as the \u201cprogressive, competitive option\u201d. McNulty wrote: \u201cGatwick expansion \u2026 would build on the success of airport competition that has seen more choice, improved services and lower fares for passengers. It would help write the next chapter in this success story rather than turn the clock back to the old monopoly of the past.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/23/overwhelming-case-for-heathrow-expansion-says-commission-chair\">'Overwhelming' case for Heathrow expansion, says commission chair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Sir Howard Davies on Monday reiterated his view that the case for Heathrow was overwhelming, adding: \u201cYou struggle to find local supporters of expansion near Gatwick.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s response to the commission\u2019s report was delayed last December, ostensibly to conduct further studies into air quality around Heathrow. Although the results of the Department for Transport\u2019s research have not been released, Heathrow has said it is confident that the studies have turned up no new obstacle. </p> <p>But environmental concerns will be at the forefront of opposition to Heathrow expansion, in terms of air quality, climate change and noise. Green MP Caroline Lucas condemned the \u201cclimate-wrecking plans\u201d for new runways and called for a frequent flyer levy to reduce the demand for flying. She said: \u201cWe know that laying more Tarmac at either Heathrow or Gatwick will bust any hope we have of meeting our climate change commitments, and inflict noise and air pollution on already blighted local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth backed the proposal. Greenpeace UK\u2019s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: \u201cAviation is one of the high-carbon industries where demand restraint is essential as the only practical means of controlling its spiralling emissions.\u201d</p> <p>The chair of the Commons\u2019 environmental audit committee, Mary Creagh MP, said it would be seeking assurances from the government that any new airport capacity could be reconciled with climate change commitments and legal air pollution limits. </p>",
  "<p>Getting out of the EU without precipitating a constitutional crisis is going to be a severe test of the UK\u2019s politicians and the political arrangements in which they operate. It will require tact, diplomacy, patience, and a willingness to try to reach a consensus. So far, there is little evidence of any of these qualities. Most of the blame for that must fall on the prime minister, since although all the participants \u2013 the leaders of the devolved assemblies and the UK parliament \u2013 have a role in this unprecedented process, she sets the tone: so far, it has been confrontational. She has little alternative but to accept the result, and to play for time while Whitehall works out what needs doing and in what order. But she has sounded high-handed on a hard Brexit, on engaging with parliament and now on the role of the devolved administrations that could lead, all too easily, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/theresa-may-constitutional-crisis-brexit-deal-institute-for-government\" title=\"\">to the break-up of the United Kingdom</a>.</p> <p>Today\u2019s meeting of the joint ministerial committee of the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with Theresa May and her ministers \u2013 not only the first since the referendum, but the first for nearly two years \u2013 was an indication of how quickly it could all go wrong. After a morning of \u201crobust\u201d discussion, the first ministers emerged complaining about the government\u2019s lack of transparency and its failure to make any concessions on their key demand of continuing access to the single market. While much of this is predictable and not entirely unrelated to domestic considerations, it underlines the importance \u2013 as a new <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/four-nation-brexit\" title=\"\">report from the Institute for Government</a> explains in detail \u2013 of reaching common positions as a basis for future negotiations with Brussels, through teamwork between Whitehall officials and the devolved administrations. London too should be part of this process; the absence of a specifically English regional voice is a weakness. A negotiation that goes as far as possible to reach a position that leavers and remainers can both accept is essential.</p> <p>Behind the bold simplicities of freedom of movement, the single market and free trade lurk a thousand variables that have different effects on different parts of the UK. Trade in particular, which once merely meant tangible goods, is now a huge and complex area that embraces intellectual property, public service procurement, financial and other services. The continuing crisis over Ceta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/belgium-eu-ultimatum-canada-trade-deal-ceta-wallonia\" title=\"\">the Canadian trade deal </a>with the EU that was a decade in the making, is a reminder of how easily it can all go wrong. The power that two of Belgium\u2019s regional bodies exploited last week to veto the deal because of concerns over the impact of globalisation on jobs and the power that it gives to corporations to sue nation states, was only conceded by Brussels in order to try to ensure democratic legitimacy. It is easy to imagine a similar revolt against a Brexit deal: that is, after all, what the leavers\u2019 slogan of taking back control implies.</p> <p>There is another reason why Mrs May must make a priority of working for consensus \u2013 certainly much more than she has so far \u2013 between the four nations. If she does not, she will collide with the complications of a series of overlapping mandates that arise from the failure to include a \u201cdual majority\u201d clause in the EU referendum act. That would have required all four nations of the UK to have majorities in order to overturn the status quo; it would have avoided the situation faced now where Scotland and Northern Ireland, each with their own electoral legitimacy, demand that the terms of the negotiation recognise that they are faced with seriously damaging consequences from a decision that their voters rejected.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s response so far is to insist that her government alone controls the process. Technically, she is right both about negotiating withdrawal from the EU, and about the established relations with the devolved assemblies: neither trade nor international relations are devolved matters. However, typically of Britain\u2019s constitutional arrangements, the relationship between devolved and non-devolved matters often turns out to be a matter of negotiation. And the politics of it are likely to privilege the devolved bodies, not least because much of the detail of the Brexit negotiations \u2013 on fisheries, food, farming and the environment, for example \u2013 are of intense concern to them.</p> <p>Pressed again on her negotiating strategy and the role of parliament in its formulation, Mrs May repeated in the Commons this afternoon that there would be no running commentary. This is a recipe for confrontation that could lead to a constitutional crisis. It will take a policy of transparency and a search for consensus to avert it.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/tata-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry-replaced-ratan-tata-jaguar-land-rover-tata-steel\">The ousting of Cyrus Mistry as boss of Tata</a> is a shock and could have serious implications for the UK.</p> <p>Tata matters to the UK. It owns Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain, Tata Steel (11,000 jobs) and other brands including Tetley Tea.</p> <p>Theresa May is keen to draw up an industrial strategy for the country. One of the key people the prime minister needs to talk to for that is the boss of Tata. In fact, one of the first people Greg Clark met after becoming business secretary was Mistry in Mumbai.</p> <p>The end of Mistry\u2019s four-year tenure was revealed in a remarkably terse statement by the Indian conglomerate. \u201cThe decision was taken at a board meeting held here today,\u201d Tata said. Sources say there was discontent on the board and among shareholders about the financial performance of the group.</p> <p>The change at the top of Tata has created a storm in India, where it is arguably the country\u2019s most famous corporate group. Mistry\u2019s exit was the lead story on Indian news sites on Monday. To put it into context, Ratan Tata, who is replacing Mistry on an interim basis, wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi to inform him of the news.</p> <p>Tata has become renowned for its stability, privacy, and long-term perspective. Mistry only gave his first interview as Tata boss a few weeks ago, and that was to the group website. Tata\u2019s overseas expansion, particularly into Britain, created much pride in India.</p> <p>So this brutal switch at the top is extraordinary. Ratan Tata was chairman for 21 years before stepping aside for Mistry in 2012 after turning 75. Now he is back as chairman, at least for the next four months as a committee looks for a permanent replacement.</p> <p>Ironically, one the biggest criticisms from analysts and investors about Tata under Mistry has been the slow speed at which he has tackled the problems facing the conglomerate. </p> <p>Although Ratan Tata expanded the company around the world, some of the businesses he bought now look overpriced and in need of restructuring \u2013 perhaps none more so than Tata Steel. Tata paid \u00a36.2bn for the Corus steel business in 2007, which in hindsight was the top of the commodities and financial cycle.</p> <p>If only Tata had acted as decisively with its UK steel business as it has with axing Mistry. The Indian company announced it was reviewing the future of its UK business in March, but this remains unresolved.<br></p> <p>The departure of Mistry as chairman could be good news for Tata Steel\u2019s 11,000 UK workers because Ratan Tata is a renowned Anglophile who bought the business in the first place.</p> <p>But Mistry and Tata Steel had been making progress on a potential merger of its European steel operations with ThyssenKrupp and were close to a deal with the UK government about financial support and a restructuring of its pension scheme.</p> <p>There is now a new uncertainty hanging over this deal. After months of worrying about their future, workers at the Port Talbot steelworks owned by Tata Steel could do without this.</p> <h2>Heathrow</h2> <p>The main argument about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport\">why Britain needs to expand its airport capacity in south-east England</a> is to help economic growth and encourage trade links with emerging markets such as China.</p> <p>But on the eve of the government announcing whether to expand Heathrow, Gatwick or neither, British Airways has quietly put a spanner in that argument.</p> <p>With remarkable timing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/ba-scraps-service-chinese-city-airport-expansion-heathrow-chengdu-decision-runway\">BA has decided to drop its flights from Heathrow to Chengdu</a>, the Chinese city that was cited by pro-expansion campaigners as a key destination. BA launched flights to Chengdu, its fourth Chinese destination, in late 2013. It had already trimmed the frequency of the service on the route.</p> <p>The success or failure of one route should not determine Britain\u2019s transport strategy. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, has previously blamed the problems getting a British visa for weak demand on flights to and from China. Nonetheless, it shows that some of the presumptions behind the arguments to expand Heathrow or Gatwick \u2013 such as the boost to Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 are by no means guaranteed.</p> <h2>BHS</h2> <p>Away from the House of Commons and its raucous criticism of Sir Philip Green, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">BHS</a> scandal is far from over. </p> <p>The department store chain\u2019s administrators, the Insolvency Service, and the Serious Fraud Office are all still hard at work establishing why the company collapsed and trying to recover money owed to it.<br></p> <p>As shown by the news at the weekend that the administrators to BHS are trying to wind up Retail Acquisitions, the company Dominic Chappell used to buy the retailer, there is still much work to do on this front.</p> <p>If Retail Acquisitions is wound up then Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, will gain access to it books and potentially recover funds that it owes BHS. This could be vital in understanding what went on before the collapse, which left more than \u00a31bn of debts and led to 11,000 job losses.</p>",

On top of this, schools are now experiencing increased difficulties in retaining staff. Ministers need to ask themselves why this is happening and take immediate action.</p> <p> \u201cThey need to face the fact that schools have become more difficult and less rewarding places in which to work. Intense workload and the demands of high-stakes testing\u200e create an environment where job satisfaction is becoming rare.\u201d</p> <p>The NUT says staffing problems mean schools are relying on supply teacher agencies and teachers covering roles outside their specialism. \u201cThe quality of provision is being lowered \u2013 and ministers must take responsibility for this,\u201d said Courtney.</p> <p>John Pugh, the Lib Dems education spokesman, said: \u201cIt is bad enough that dedicated teachers are being driven away from the profession they love, but this is also laying the foundations for a disastrous teaching shortage in years to come if we cannot train new teachers fast enough to replace the ones which leave.\u201d</p> <p>He called on the government to work with the profession to address the factors making teachers feel demoralised and undervalued, and reverse \u201cdevastating\u201d cuts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/school-funding\">school budgets</a> which put added pressure on teachers.</p> <p>Alison Ryan, senior policy adviser at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, added: \u201cThe loss of teachers is a tragic and expensive waste, and particularly catastrophic as the number of pupils is set to increase dramatically over the next few years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/burnout-teachers-teaching-extra-work\">To keep burnout at bay, teachers must learn to say no | Kester Brewin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe government needs to tackle the reasons why teachers are leaving the profession; excessive workload, working within an assessment system that strips the joy from pupils\u2019 learning and dealing with a treadmill of constant change in education.\u201d</p> <p>The number of newly qualified teachers entering state schools dropped to 20,600 in 2011 but climbed to 25,500 in 2015.</p> <p>Many in the education sector have expressed frustration as ministers roll out new policies on academisation and more recently, on increased selection.

Polls consistently show high levels of disillusionment; more than half of teachers surveyed in a YouGov poll last year said they were considering leaving the classroom in the next two years.</p> <p>Of those that leave the state sector, as detailed in the figures revealed by Gibb, some take up posts in private schools, others go to teach overseas while a number reconsider their career altogether.</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cTeaching remains an attractive career and we have more teachers entering our classrooms than those choosing to leave or retire.</p> <p>\u201cTeacher retention has been broadly stable for 20 years and the annual average salaries for teachers in the UK are also greater than the OECD average, and higher than many of Europe\u2019s high-performing education systems like Finland, Norway or Sweden.</p> <p>\u201cWe want every child to have access to great teachers that aren\u2019t weighed down with unnecessary workload so they have the time and freedom to do what they do best - inspire the next generation.

  "<p>Last week Filipino sailor Antonio Libref was in forest in the Horn of Africa marking his 1,672nd day in captivity at the hands of Somali pirates. Kept alongside 25 other Asians, all crew of the Omani-flagged Naham 3 fishing vessel, thin and haggard hostages were treated \u201clike animals\u201d forced \u201cto eat rats just to survive\u201d.<br></p> <p>On Monday, the 32-year-old was having his first proper meal as a newly free man in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Two days earlier, he and fellow sailors from Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, Indonesia and China, captured in March 2012 south of the Seychelles, had been released in exchange for a ransom. <br></p> <p>Bile Hussein, the pirates\u2019 representative, claimed in comments reported by one news agency that the value of that ransom was $1.5m (\u00a31.2m), a figure that could not be independently confirmed. </p> <p>The men\u2019s handover represented \u201cthe end of captivity for the last remaining seafarers taken hostage during the height of Somali piracy\u201d, said the NGO Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP). The Taiwan-owned Naham 3 crew were the second-longest held hostages by Somali pirates. Only one other group, <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2015/February/longest-held-hostages-in-somalia-s-history-released.html\">who were released in 2015</a> after five years, were held longer. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe were treated like animals, so it feels good to be human again,\u201d Libref told the Guardian via phone as he waited to be repatriated to the Philippines, where he hopes to join his family later this week. He said he was thrilled to be free.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m full of happiness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a surprise; we didn\u2019t expect to be released ... If you believe in God, hope is always there \u2013 we were in the hands of pirates yet there was hope, there was a miracle and we\u2019re back in normality.\u201d</p> <p>The happiness of those who were freed, however, may be tinged with the grief felt for those who did not make it. The Naham 3 crew had originally numbered 29, but the captain was killed on the day the ship was hijacked and two others \u201csuccumbed to illness during their captivity\u201d, according to OBP. </p> <p>Details of how the sailors were released \u2013 and who paid a ransom \u2013 have been kept under wraps. What is known is that the men\u2019s torment came to an end when they were flown to Nairobi on Sunday evening. Images taken at the Jomo Kenyatta international airport show the former hostages, tears in their eyes, hugging each other in disbelief. </p> <p>John Steed, a retired British colonel who helped to negotiate the release as coordinator of the Hostage Support Partners (HSP), was on the plane to bring the men to Kenya. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe flew into Somalia yesterday to the city of Galkayo, which is one of these divided cities with a lot of fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe picked them up in an airstrip outside the city, and they were handed to us by a local community, elders and regional administration, and flew them back here to Nairobi, where they are having medical care.\u201d<br></p> <p>Steed said the hostages were beginning to open up, talking about \u201chow cruel the pirates were and how they beat them up and tortured them\u201d. Some of their account is harrowing. The hostages have said that two of the sailors who subsequently died were then kept inside the freezer. <br></p> <p>After being captured, Libref and his fellow hostages were kept on board Naham 3 for a year and a half before being taken to land. The OBP said trawler was initially tethered to another hijacked vessel, the MV Albedo, but that both had subsequently sunk, on separate occasions. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhen the MV Albedo began to sink, with its crew onboard, the crew of the Naham 3 courageously assisted in their rescue by jumping into the ocean to save the drowning seafarers. Over a year after its capture, the Naham 3 sank and the crew was brought ashore, where they were subject to much greater risks,\u201d according to OBP.<br></p> <p>Out in the forest, Libref said the hostages became so hungry they ate rats. \u201cWe suffered a lot, we only ate rice, beans, flour, wheat, so we were forced to catch rats; we had to survive,\u201d he said. They made nets out of rope and tree trunks to capture rats and birds, using rice as bait. <br></p> <p>Arnel Balbero, another of the captives, told the BBC his time as a hostage had left him feeling like the \u201cwalking dead\u201d. </p> <p>Many people went to greet the hostages as they arrived in Nairobi, but the presence of one person took all 26 of them by surprise. Michael Scott Moore is a <br>US journalist who had spent five months with them on Naham 3. Moore, who was captured while researching a book on piracy in Somalia, was released in 2014.<br></p> <p>He said he had got along well with all the former hostages, especially the five Filipinos, who spoke English. He said their tales of captivity were an indication of how badly they were treated. <br></p> <p>\u201cI was totally hungry. I lost a lot of weight but I wasn\u2019t so desperate that I felt that I needed to catch birds,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo of them died of disease; what they always do is throw drugs at the person who is sick. When I came down with something actually serious, they tested my blood, and they found it was malaria and they brought me the proper medication. The fact that they didn\u2019t do that with these guys tells you that on an individual level, the circumstances were worse for each one of them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Piracy off Somalia\u2019s coast was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/22/piracy-somalia-european-union\">once a serious threat</a> to the global shipping industry, but the number of attacks has declined sharply in recent years since vessels began carrying armed guards and EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/somalia-pirate-mission-expanded-eu\">naval forces increased patrols</a>. No commercial ship has been successfully attacked for about four years, but observers warn the threat remains. </p> <p>The OBP said on Saturday: \u201cWhilst there has not been a successful attack on a commercial vessel since 2012, there have been a number of attacks on fishing vessels and there remain a number of hostages still held in Somalia.\u201d Among those still far from freedom are 10 Iranians and three Kenyans. In 2015, at least 306 seafarers were attacked in the region. </p> <p>Libref said he did not have any plans for the future yet. \u201cNow, to be free is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my message is to the pirates: what they are doing is very bad. You capture people; you ask for money. What is the value of money?\u201d <br></p>",
  "<p>One of the things that attracted Fitzalbert Taylor to becoming a coal miner was the warmth. \u201cIt was like I\u2019d emigrated to a different country down there,\u201d says the 88-year-old. \u201cIt was so warm. When I was in the building trade, I couldn\u2019t feel my arms or my legs \u2013 donkey jacket, two pairs of trousers and you were still cold.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor moved to the UK from Jamaica in 1954 when he was 26, and spent 25 years working as a miner.

The initiative\u2019s founder, historian Norma Gregory, says the role black miners played in the history of British mining industry has been badly neglected. \u201cI\u2019ve searched through so many books, films and archives, with the help of volunteers, and I\u2019ve found very few mentions of miners of other nationalities,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09b951c7d309b95a5715542f1913bc9f8db9a812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b951c7d309b95a5715542f1913bc9f8db9a812/216_0_2767_3456/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lincoln Cole, Gedling miner 1965-1987, father of ex-England footballer Andy Cole.

There are no reliable records of how many non-white miners worked in British mines but Gregory estimates that between the early 50s and the late 80s there were nearly 1,000 men of African-Caribbean origin working in Nottinghamshire mines at any one time. Collieries did not keep records of workers\u2019 ethnicity, and when pits started closing in the 1980s personnel documents were often destroyed, leaving researchers like Gregory to rely on former miners to suggest possible interviewees.</p> <p>Garrey Mitchell started working at Gedling colliery in Nottingham in 1975, aged 17, and worked there until 1986, when he left to start his own business. He got the job because the manager had known his father, who was also a miner, and who had emigrated from Jamaica in the early 50s. \u201cWe were very united down there. You had to be,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cYou had to watch each others\u2019 backs. Colour didn\u2019t come into it.

On 23 August 1958, the city saw a 1,000-person-strong race riot, a precursor to the violence that erupted in London\u2019s Notting Hill a week later. Eight people were hospitalised and the Nottingham Evening Post wrote that Nottingham had become like \u201ca slaughterhouse\u201d.</p> <p>Cole says his introduction to the city in the early 60s wasn\u2019t particularly pleasant. \u201cThere were teddy boys with bicycle chains,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom six o\u2019clock you couldn\u2019t go out, because they would kick you left, right and centre.\u201d While racial tension was simmering over on the streets, it does not feature much in the accounts from below ground. When a colleague used a racial slur against Cole, the colliery manager told the offender to apologise immediately and threatened to sack him. The men report that opportunities for promotion were limited because of their skin colour, and Mitchell says black miners generally brushed off racist comments by colleagues: \u201cThere was no use having friction, because it would give a bad atmosphere and [that was] the last thing you wanted.\u201d</p> <p>When the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike in 1972 and 1974, black miners in Nottingham joined their colleagues on the picket line.

  "<p>Feted as the final piece in an expensively assembled jigsaw in the summer and pilloried as a lavish disappointment barely two months later, Paul Pogba makes a convenient scapegoat now that it transpires he did not arrive in England holding a wand that could magic away all of Manchester United\u2019s problems with one extravagant flourish. The temptation to give him a good kicking is strong, not least because he makes it easy for his critics. Pogba loves a flashy new haircut. He looks offensively pleased with himself when he scores. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/stormzy-and-laundry-ladies-the-new-face-of-transfer-announcements\">There was that whole Stormzy business. </a>He must be taken down.</p> <p>But before we all jump on the bandwagon in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">United\u2019s humiliation at the hands of Chelsea</a>, it is worth considering why such an extraordinary talent is yet to replicate his Juventus form since putting on a red shirt again. Not because he is a foreign player who needs time to settle (resist the urge to shout that anyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">signed for \u00a393.2m</a> should be hitting the ground running at a pace that would shame Usain Bolt). But because of the feeling that something deeper is at play here, that while trading on the romance and grandeur of United\u2019s name remains an easy enough sell to glitzy new signings and sponsors, deep pockets on their own are not enough to restore a club\u2019s shattered sense of identity on the pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/24/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-antonio-conte\">Don\u2019t be too swift to bury Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 the monster may be stirring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be pushing it to make excuses for the way Pogba was strolling in midfield as N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 scored Chelsea\u2019s fourth, other than to point out it was his third start in six days. Yet it is harder to understand why a player who excelled for Juventus has been so limp for United.</p> <p>There have been flashes, such as a starring performance in the thrashing of Leicester City and his lovely second goal in last week\u2019s victory over Fenerbahce, but one of the dilemmas for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is that he appeared to have solved the Pogba conundrum by moving him from a deeper position to a role behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic against Leicester. There was a moment in that game when he linked up beautifully with Ibrahimovic, scooping a gorgeous pass over the top for the striker to swivel and almost score a superb volley. But his impact in the defeat at Chelsea and the goalless draw at Liverpool was minimal, his relationship with Ibrahimovic nonexistent. Surely there is more to come from the 23-year-old.</p> <p>But wait. If it is not quite fair to liken United\u2019s transfer policy since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement to Real Madrid\u2019s gorge on gal\u00e1cticos, given that efforts have been made to improve their defence, it is nonetheless the case that Pogba and Ibrahimovic are merely the latest glamour signings who are unable to mask wider flaws. Perhaps the same can be said of Mourinho in the dugout, and Louis van Gaal before him.</p> <p>Surely there was more to come from Juan Mata, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Radamel Falcao. Just wait until the mysterious Henrikh Mkhitaryan settles. Surely Mourinho will sort it out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-rages-manchester-united-incredible-mistakes-chelsea\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accuses Antonio Conte of humiliating him after Chelsea defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>United\u2019s signings make sense on their own. David Moyes tried to save himself by adding the creativity of Mata, the link man United craved. Van Gaal was given Di Mar\u00eda, a winger to provide dash and invention, until it turned out that Memphis Depay was the future. Falcao was an upgrade on Danny Welbeck and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. Ander Herrera was the midfielder who could make United pass like a Spanish side. Morgan Schneiderlin would screen the defence. Pogba was the global midfield sensation they needed, Mkhitaryan the subtle No10, Ibrahimovic the trophy-winning goal machine.</p> <p>Spending hundreds of millions, the latest shiny toy is hailed as The Answer, while little of any significance changes. Mourinho seemed to have cracked it when he rightly dropped Wayne Rooney against Leicester. But just as England discovered in the draw with Slovenia, Rooney\u2019s decline is not the only issue.</p> <p>United have had three managers in the space of three and a bit seasons, each of them introducing a new way of playing to a mish-mash of a squad. Moyes floundered, Van Gaal placed too high a value on control and now Mourinho wants to implement a solid 4-2-3-1 that is beginning to look a little tired and dated with its reliance on physical strength. No wonder the players are confused. Chelsea are far from the finished article but they are developing into a team with a clear way of playing under Antonio Conte. The Italian has even found a use for Victor Moses other than sending him out on loan. He is managing his resources and working with the tools at his disposal, just as J\u00fcrgen Klopp has responded to Liverpool\u2019s weakness at left-back by moving James Milner there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2016/oct/24/smalling-is-appalling-as-united-capitulate-at-chelsea-football-weekly\">Smalling is appalling as United capitulate at Chelsea \u2013 Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A simple test is to compare the football played by the league\u2019s top sides with United\u2019s. Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City want to be expansive, Arsenal are playing Wengerball with more of a swagger with Alexis S\u00e1nchez up front, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur press like demons and have plenty of ingenuity in attack, and Klopp\u2019s Liverpool attack from all angles. United proved themselves capable of stifling Liverpool but they played a destructive rather than a creative game.</p> <p>Every now and then, United click thanks to their individual quality. Di Mar\u00eda was a delight in the sunny early days but left for Paris Saint-Germain. Mata has chipped in with important goals but none of his managers have entirely trusted him. Ibrahimovic has faded since the Manchester derby. United are six points off the leaders, but they have been inconsistent for too long, erring by valuing individuals over the collective.</p> <p>Mourinho has made mistakes, from benching Anthony Martial to the treatment of Luke Shaw after the Watford defeat, to his struggle to let go of his inherent caution in big games. Perhaps he has lost the spark that made him special, a super manager whose aura has faded, a luxury hire by United when they needed someone fresher.</p> <p>Whatever happens next, however, it is becoming clearer that United need to think in the long term again, whoever is sitting in the dugout. Throwing wild sums of money at the problem is not the answer. Whatever you think of Guardiola\u2019s philosophy, the presence of Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano in City\u2019s boardroom shows what kind of team City want to build. They stand for something now, whereas Pogba has joined a team without any discernible personality. Bringing in the next famous face, another big name, will not cure United\u2019s ills.</p>",

They managed household finances and were crucial to the country\u2019s ability to prosper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ece39868346e38afe0e0e59e86d0b96ad463fac5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ece39868346e38afe0e0e59e86d0b96ad463fac5/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Daughters of Reykjavik are a feminist rap collective who rap about gender issuesl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daughters of Reykjavik are a feminist rap collective who rap about gender issues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1975, Icelandic women were fed up. It wasn\u2019t just that they weren\u2019t being properly paid for their labour, they also were sick of their lack of political representation: only nine women had ever won seats in parliament. So, against the backdrop of the global feminist movement, Iceland\u2019s women decided to take things into their own hands.</p> <p>An outpouring of women on to the streets was, by then, a well-trodden form of activism. In 1970, tens of thousands of women had <a href=\"http://time.com/4008060/women-strike-equality-1970/\">protested on Fifth Avenue</a> in Manhattan. In the UK, that same year, 20,000 women <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood/timeline\">marched in Leeds</a> against discriminatory wages. But what made Iceland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/18/gender.uk\">day of protest on 24 October 1975</a> so effective was the number of women who participated. It was not just the impact of 25,000 women \u2013 which, at the time, was a fifth of the female population \u2013 that gathered on the streets of Reykjavik, but the 90% of Iceland\u2019s female population who went on all-out professional and domestic strike. Teachers, nurses, office workers, housewives put down tools and didn\u2019t go to work, provide childcare or even cook in their kitchens. All to prove how indispensable they were.</p> <p>Thordis Loa Thorhallsdottir, CEO of a tourism company, was on the streets that day: \u201cI was 10 at the time, and I remember it very clearly, standing there with my mother, fighting. I can still feel the crowd and the power that was there. The big message was that if women don\u2019t work, the whole community is paralysed \u2013 the whole society.\u201d</p> <p>Grassroots activism at such a scale unsurprisingly had a significant material impact. Within five years, the country had the world\u2019s first democratically elected female president \u2013 Vigdis Finnbogadottir. Now in her 80s, this steely-eyed powerhouse tells me of the impact that day of protest had on her own career trajectory.</p> <p>\u201cI would never have been elected in 1980 if it hadn\u2019t been for the women\u2019s day of action \u2026 because when my predecessor announced that he was not going to stand again, the voices were immediately heard: now we have to have a woman among the candidates.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"724f044b3cfaf48ae6b12e5403666f0483eeeb1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724f044b3cfaf48ae6b12e5403666f0483eeeb1e/0_0_398_626/318.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Iceland is a good place to be a woman.\u2019\" width=\"318\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Iceland is a good place to be a woman.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loftur \u00c1sgeirsson/Reykjavik City Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other landmarks soon followed. An all-female political party \u2013 the Women\u2019s Alliance \u2013 was established. More women were elected to parliament; by 1999, more than a third of MPs were women.</p> <p>And then, in 2000, parental leave legislation came into effect: whichevery person I spoke to highlighted this moment as key to Iceland\u2019s march to the top of the gender-equality table. Today, every parent receives three months\u2019 paid leave that is non-transferable. Parents then have an additional three months to share as they like.</p> <p>Because the pay is significant \u2013 80% of salary up to a ceiling of \u00a32,300 a month \u2013 and because it\u2019s on a use-it-or-lose-it basis, 90% of Icelandic fathers take up their paternal leave. This piece of social engineering has had a profound impact on men as well as women. Not only do women return to work after giving birth faster than before, they return to their pre-childbirth working hours faster, too. Research shows that, after taking the three months\u2019 leave, fathers continue to be significantly more involved in childcare and do more housework. Sharing the parental responsibilities and chores from the beginning, it seems, makes a difference.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good place to be a woman,\u201d says Thorhallsdottir. And it is. Almost 80% of Icelandic women work. Thanks to mandatory quotas, almost half of board members of listed companies are now women, while 65% of Iceland\u2019s university students and 41% of MPs are female.</p> <p>Yet, women I met on my journey were also clear that the country has a long way to go. They still have less economic power than men \u2013 only 22% of managers are women; only 30% of experts on TV are women; and women still earn around 14% less than men. Iceland\u2019s record on all of these fronts is better than most countries; in the UK, women\u2019s hourly pay is 18% less than men.</p> <p>It is the gender pay gap that puzzles me the most. How can it be that it is still so significant given the huge efforts the state has put into mitigating the \u201cmummy penalty\u201d? Not only when it comes to parental leave, but with heavily subsidised nursery schools and after-school care?</p> <p>Explanations vary: from women going into less well-paid professions, to the <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/labour-market-and-economic-reports/equality-issues/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap\">penalty paid for working part-time</a> that we\u2019ve found in the UK as well, to the time it takes for employers\u2019 implicit gender biases to shift.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/25/iceland-most-feminist-country\">Iceland: the world's most feminist country</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/steiney90/?hl=en\">Steiney Skuladottir</a>, one of Reykjav\u00edkurd\u00e6tur (or the <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/reykjavkurdtur-interview-2016\">Daughters of Reykjavik</a>) \u2013 a feminist rap collective who rap about gender issues \u2013 puts the blame in part on women\u2019s reluctance to ask for sufficient pay compensation.

  "<p>Polly Toynbee\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/public-turning-against-brexit-theresa-may-immigration\" title=\"\">The public are already turning against Brexit. When&#xa0;will Theresa May listen?</a>, theguardian.com, 20 October) made me think that there might be a route back to power for Labour, if it became the party for the 48% who wish to remain in the EU, and for the many more who are coming to that view as the consequences of leaving become apparent.</p> <p>A decision to challenge the referendum result would need to be accompanied by policies to help those who have been left behind by globalisation, many of whom voted Brexit because they had so little to lose. This is partly about investing in a more balanced distribution of economic growth, but also requires unapologetic support for redistribution, focusing on the need to address an unprecedented increase in inequality, and the real hardship faced by those left behind.</p> <p>With the Tory government set on inflicting enormous and irreversible damage to our economy, our society, and our union, there is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Labour to be the party of the sane alternative, attracting voters who would not perhaps normally vote Labour. Who knows, with a bit of compromise, it might even be possible to forge a united Labour opposition around that position. It is perhaps the only issue where there is a real possibility of attracting enough new Labour voters to evict the Conservatives.<br><strong>Mick Foster</strong><br><em>Chelmsford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee refers to the four freedoms. Why only four freedoms? Why is each beneficial to commercial enterprises but not necessarily to the wider community? (The welfare of megacorporations is not synonymous with social welfare.) Why are there only freedoms to, not freedom from? Why freedom to extend the iron grip of economic reductionism, not freedom from phenomena like job insecurity and freedom from fear of losing the continuity of community? What\u2019s wrong with economics as though people matter?</p> <p>The compression of human rights into four freedoms leads to a conflation of human rights with the neoliberal agenda. This is naive and dangerous. Let\u2019s change the terms of the debate in Europe, not just chunter on as though \u201cfour freedoms\u201d is an unquestionable assertion of fundamental moral principle. Time to reframe, surely.<br><strong>Tony Brauer</strong><br><em>Jordans, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Before we teeter off the \u201chard Brexit\u201d cliff edge (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/italian-job-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">Real life has turned into a remake of The Italian Job</a>, 20 October), it is surely worth considering the scope for a \u201cthird way\u201d between the current free movement of labour policies followed within the EU and Theresa May\u2019s preference for managed migration.</p> <p>One such option would involve an open work-and-study-permit arrangement that allowed free movement between the EU and the UK for students, and for any EU citizen with a firm offer of employment in the UK (and vice versa). This would prevent (or discourage) speculative migration, where people move from one country to another and then search for work on arrival. While it would therefore be likely to reduce flows of unskilled workers, it would not prevent employers from recruiting abroad for hard-to-fill jobs, in agriculture, or in the care and hospitality sectors.</p> <p>Such an arrangement could be characterised as demand-led free movement and, as such, could be acceptable to our negotiating partners. It would not give the government the control it currently appears to seek in respect of the total volume of inward migration. But by restricting the supply of unskilled or entry-level labour, it would address a major concern expressed during the referendum debate on the effect of EU free movement on wages for the lower-paid. Perhaps the basis for the type of sensible compromise that will need to be made by both parties to ensure not a hard or soft Brexit, but a good Brexit.<br><strong>Ian Jones</strong><br><em>Fownhope, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a remain voter in the EU referendum, I note with some disdain the way in which the EU leaders have dealt with Theresa May in recent days. Rather than treating her with dignity and magnanimity as a leader who is trying to do the best with the hand she has been given by the British people, she was treated like a petulant child who had misbehaved and now had to suffer (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-eu-council-summit-brexit-russia-\" title=\"\">Sketch</a>, 22 October). This and the collapsed trade deal with the Canadians (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">Frustration as Canada\u2019s EU trade deal is blocked by Belgian region</a>, 22 October) clearly reflects how weak the EU really is, and how impossible it will be for the UK to negotiate a trade deal with it. We should be under no illusions that they will negotiate on free movement or allow us not to pay into the EU\u2019s central budget in order for us to continue to play a part in it. Britain, as a clever and able country, will indeed survive and no doubt thrive with trade tariffs if this is the price it has to pay for its vote on sovereignty and self-determination on immigration.<br><strong>Robert Bradlow</strong><br><em>Reigate, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is with a great sense of trepidation I read that the chancellor, Philip Hammond \u2013 supposedly in favour of a softer Brexit \u2013 was \u201chopeful a deal was possible that allowed all European nationals to remain in the UK and UK nationals to stay in EU countries\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/19/philip-hammond-attempts-to-ease-concerns-over-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">Hammond seeks to allay fears over Brexit</a>, 20 October).</p> <p>I find it difficult to understand the statement as anything but \u201chard\u201d, as someone who has lived in London for almost 40 years \u2013 during which time I have been working and paying taxes.

  "<p>Donald Trump used to spend most of his campaign rallies citing his awesome polls in what passed for stump speeches during the primaries. He was up, and his rivals were down. He was a winner, and all the governors and senators were losers.</p> <p>But now the polls aren\u2019t so gold-plated, and he thinks they\u2019re mostly all wrong.</p> <p>\u201cEven though we\u2019re doing pretty good in the polls, I don\u2019t believe the polls anymore,\u201d the GOP nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/18/stop-whining-obama-knocks-trump\">said</a> last week in Colorado Springs. \u201cBelieve me folks, we\u2019re doing great. If we keep our spirit, and we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me.\u201d</p> <p>This is the last resort of losing campaigns: the grasping at straws that comes with the sinking feeling that all the time, money and hopes have been for naught. In their final throes, campaigns cling, sometimes bitterly, to an outlier poll, while they mutter darkly about the elites, or the media, or the polls themselves.</p> <p>In that regard, Trump is no different from past failures of presidential nominees. But in other ways, he is uniquely of this political moment. What used to be called a <a href=\"http://time.com/4381539/brexit-global-populism/\">throw-the-bums-out</a> mood has turned into a desire to blow the bums up.</p> <p>Previous campaigns used to invoke the ghost of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1948\">Harry Truman</a> to delude themselves through the final days. They loved that old photo of the newly elected president grinning as he brandished the newspaper that declared \u201c<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-deweydefeats-story-story.html\">Dewey Defeats Truman</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has no need for Truman because he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/trump-clinton-polls-brexit\">Nigel Farage</a>. Never mind that the beer-swilling former leader of the UK Independence party never quite made it to prime minister. Never mind that he was not the mainstream leadership of the \u201cleave\u201d campaign that won the referendum on the European Union.</p> <p>Instead, Trump carries Nigel Farage and Brexit on the campaign trail like some anti-elitist talisman, warding off all the polls that show him losing.</p> <p>\u201cWe will win,\u201d he said in Pennsylvania last week. \u201cWe will shock the world. This is going to be Brexit-plus.\u201d</p> <p>To the extent that you can consider this an argument, there are two strands to it. One is that the polls were all wrong about Brexit. The other is that Trump is a natural-born winner who has shocked the world through this entire election. So why would 8 November be any different?</p> <p>First, the Brexit polls. Referendum votes are notoriously hard to model for pollsters for the simple reason that there haven\u2019t been many of them. Will people actually show up when they say they are likely voters? In that sense, the Brexit polls were more unpredictable than presidential election ones are.</p> <p>Still, late surges in turnout can affect the accuracy of polls. Just ask the Kerry campaign, which was openly celebrating its victory based on the first waves of exit polling in 2004. That polling failed to detect the early-day voting patterns in outer suburbs that tipped the contest to President Bush.</p> <p>Turnout is everything in any election, and the Bush campaign had a best-in-class turnout operation that the Obama campaign learned from in 2008. If Team Trump has something similar, they have done a stunning job of keeping it hidden from the nation at large.</p> <p>Then there are the <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/\">Brexit numbers</a> themselves. Until a month out, the \u201cremain\u201d campaign was ahead in the majority of polls. But as the campaign intensified, the Brexit team pulled ahead. Of 18 polls in the first half of June, the leave campaign was ahead in 11 of them, while one was tied.</p> <p>In the final week, in the midst coverage of the assassination of MP Jo Cox, the polls leaned back in favor of remain. Polling averages ended with the race with the narrowest of edges for remain, between 0.5 and 2 points.</p> <p>Today in the presidential contest, the national polling averages \u2013 a truly blunt measure in a state-by-state election \u2013 place Clinton\u2019s lead at between 6 and 7 points. In the last three months of polling, just eight national polls have given Trump a lead and eight are tied.</p> <p>Of those 16 more positive polls for Trump, fully nine are the same outlier: a tracking poll by the LA Times and University of Southern California with an unusual methodology that is either \u201c<a href=\"http://cesrusc.org/election/\">pioneering</a>\u201d as its pollsters suggest, or an embarrassment, as its rivals suggest.</p> <p>Since the numbers don\u2019t exactly point to another Brexit, all that\u2019s left is Trump\u2019s volatility. Surely a candidate who came out of nowhere could pull off the biggest surprise in political history? Didn\u2019t he do the same in the primaries?</p> <p>Not quite. Trump was consistently ahead in the primary polling from July of last year, just one month after entering the race. You don\u2019t need both hands to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html#polls\">count the national polls</a> in which he was trailing during that time.</p> <p>Whatever the anti-Trump pundits and forecasters were basing their predictions on, it wasn\u2019t the polling numbers. Instead, it was more likely their personal shock and disbelief at the sight of Trump\u2019s success inside the GOP.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal volatility does not and did not translate into polling volatility. While the candidate may be confusing, his numbers are not. He may blow as hot and cold as a Katy Perry song, but the polls are somewhat less colorful.</p> <p>Which brings us back to Brexit. The one takeaway that is relevant to this presidential contest is the importance of turnout.

  "<p><strong>I\u2019ve been reading a lot about how fashion has to represent \u201creal women.\u201d But what does this mean and who are these \u201creal women\u201d?</strong></p> <p><em>Caroline, by email</em></p> <p>Excellent question, Caroline! I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot, especially since the publication of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/03/british-vogue-latest-issue-model-free-zone-real-women-emily-blunt\" title=\"\">latest issue of Vogue</a>, which proudly proclaims itself to be a \u201cmodel-free zone\u201d, in which clothes are photographed \u2013 as editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/alexandra-shulman\" title=\"\">Alexandra Shulman</a> explains \u2013 \u201cthrough a more real filter\u201d. We\u2019ll return to those claims later, but the point here is that this clarifies the real/non-real divide in fashion: \u201cNon-real women\u201d are models and \u201creal women\u201d are not models. I\u2019ve been pondering long and hard over who this dichotomy insults more: the models with the insinuation that they\u2019re fake women, or the non-models with the overt suggestion that they\u2019re barely evolved peasants rolling in the mud at the foothills of the models\u2019 golden palaces. And after much consideration, I\u2019ve settled on the latter. Oh, pity us potato-faced proles, living alongside the perfect superhumans that are the models! The only way we can cope is if we are repeatedly insulted by condescension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"147f28119bd9cc617a7a1e8b3b3b502f7d469142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147f28119bd9cc617a7a1e8b3b3b502f7d469142/0_0_945_1260/750.jpg\" alt=\"Vogue, November 2016 edition\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vogue, November 2016 edition.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vogue/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But look, I\u2019m not getting at Vogue about this. I\u2019m really not. I honestly take my hat off to Shulman because, let\u2019s face it, she at least makes more of an effort to deal with fashion\u2019s, shall we say, problematic body issues than any other editor I can think of. She also, quite frankly, can\u2019t win. Some of the funniest moments in her upcoming book, A Diary of My Hundredth Year, about editing Vogue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/07/vogue-happy-100th-birthday-magazine-exhibition\" title=\"\">during its centenary year</a>, are not to do with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge\" title=\"\">Duchess of Cambridge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\" title=\"\">Philip Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell\" title=\"\">Naomi Campbell</a> or any of the other gossipy bits that have already been filleted by the Daily Mail. Rather, they\u2019re to do with a certain rightwing tabloid\u2019s female columnists, who barely even look at the magazine before knocking out another 1,500 words on their editor\u2019s orders about how Vogue is so evil because it causes eating disorders and it makes these columnists feel so very unhappy about themselves and can we run some pretty pictures of models to brighten up the column and me me me and here\u2019s an invoice for a grand thank you very much (I\u2019m paraphrasing a tad, but you get the point.) So on the one hand, there\u2019s the connection between models and mental illness being made by a tabloid that, on a daily basis, reduces women to their physical appearances; and on the other, there are designers who simply do not make sample size clothes any bigger than a size 10.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/03/british-vogue-latest-issue-model-free-zone-real-women-emily-blunt\">British Vogue ditches models in favour of 'real' women \u2013 for one issue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thus we end up with the current result we see in the new Vogue, in which \u201creal women\u201d are represented by the impossibly beautiful 55-year-old Spanish-Vietnamese-American actor (and, ahem, model) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anhduongart/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Anh Duong</a> and the ridiculously sexy 30-year-old playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/polly-stenham\" title=\"\">Polly Stenham</a>. Well, all I can say is, if these are \u201creal women\u201d then I must be a troglodyte. Models have never made me feel bad about myself because I understand that they are not supposed to represent me. But to be told that a real woman who lives in the \u201creal filter\u201d looks like the gorgeous artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/phoebethegorgon/\" title=\"\">Phoebe Collings-James</a> (one of notably few \u201creal women\u201d of colour, incidentally) is a little jarring. Which filter am I in? I hope it\u2019s Valencia.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s Vogue, so of course you\u2019re only going to see gorgeous people. But what\u2019s the point in substituting professionally beautiful women for ones who are just as beautiful but happen to do something else for a living? Is it the fact that models don\u2019t have a second job that makes them objectionable? And, in any case, this issue of Vogue is clearly not a \u201cmodel-free\u201d zone, given that all its adverts, which make about a third of its pages, feature nothing but models, or, as I guess we\u2019re supposed to call them now, \u201cnon-real women\u201d. And \u2019twas always going to be thus. After all, Shulman might be able to get in some attractive artists to wear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci\" title=\"\">Gucci</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/22/burberry-ready-modernise-fashion-without-delay\" title=\"\">Burberry</a>, but she can\u2019t reinvent the wheel.</p> <p>But let\u2019s look a little more at this idea of \u201creal women\u201d. Who are they? Where do they live? What do they do for work? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a chap who works in advertising \u2013 presumably for a certain soap brand \u2013 who has a checklist that answers all of those questions. The only answer I can give with any certainty, speaking as a fellow real woman (I think?), is that she is not a model, as we have already established that this is what shifts a woman from the realm of the real to the non-real. (Hilariously, Vogue includes an interview with a 25-year-old solicitor who, until two years ago, was a model. Welcome to the world of \u201creal women\u201d, ma\u2019am! I hope your transition was not too bumpy!)</p> <p>Look, you don\u2019t need to be as annoyingly obtuse as me to find this \u201creal women\u201d versus \u201cnon-real women\u201d schtick annoying. Yes, models present a very limited perspective of female beauty, and I get that what Vogue and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women\" title=\"\">various advertising campaigns</a> are trying to do is provide a broader perspective. But to suggest that models are otherworldly creatures who the rest of us can never equal is just another way of deifying them and patronising the rest of us. So instead of this \u201creal\u201d versus \u201cnon-real\u201d nonsense, how about just referring to them as \u201cmodels\u201d and \u201cnon-models\u201d, and not insinuating that the latter represent ALL non-models. Because, as frustrating as this must be to market researchers, advertisers, fashion magazine and tabloid columnists, the female world is not divided into models and the rest of us: it is just a lot of diverse women, doing their thing. And the only thing I\u2019m pretty sure you can say for certain about all of us is that we\u2019re all real.</p> <p><em>Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Collaborators say there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/19/i-would-hide-4-u-whats-in-princes-secret-vault\">a vault of unreleased songs that constitute 70% of Prince\u2019s oeuvre</a>, so his estate looks set to be flush for decades to come. If so, he would not be the first artist to trust posterity more than he trusted contemporary taste.</p> <p>Beethoven, upon finding that no musician in Vienna could play his string quartets, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/beethoven-for-a-later-age-by-edward-dusinberre-review-tantalisin/\">told a frustrated violinist</a>: \u201cThey are not for you, but for a later age.\u201d The Alexandrian poet CP Cavafy, who died in 1932, comprehensively suppressed the erotic poems he is now famous for. Kafka ordered that all his manuscripts be burned upon his death \u2013 an order, thankfully, defied.</p> <p>In general, the historic pattern was: in an artist\u2019s lifetime, creative work gets filtered through what taste and the market can withstand. After they are dead, and adjudged to be great, the market becomes very eager to commercialise their unpublished work. The work\u2019s value is boosted by the fact that, being dead, they are unable to produce any more stuff, creating instant scarcity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/25/paisley-park-minnesota-to-become-permanent-prince-museum\">Prince's Paisley Park granted permission to become permanent museum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was David Bowie who, in 1997, first understood that technology might be about to disrupt the old pattern. In a pioneering financial arrangement, Bowie securitised the projected income on his already-published music \u2013 meaning he took a loan of $55m (then \u00a333m) against his future royalties, in return for 8% annual interest over 10 years. His motivation was that, with the arrival of the internet, royalties on recorded music would probably diminish \u2013 so better to get them sooner rather than later.</p> <p>It\u2019s known that Prince consulted David Pullman, who designed the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35280945\">so-called Bowie bond</a>, not long after Bowie\u2019s deal was publicised. Pullman has told reporters he thinks Prince\u2019s unsold songs might be worth up to $100m. But there was no \u201cPrince bond\u201d. Prince\u2019s estate seems likely to trickle out the material over several years, extracting maximum value not just from the music but from his image.</p> <p>If so, in addition to inventing an entire musical genre, Prince may go down as the inventor of post-death capitalism. He turned the logic of the Bowie bond on its head and did something far more interesting.</p> <p>For an economy based increasingly on intellectual property, copyright laws are crucial. The conglomerates who own the major music and movie studios have, over time, managed to extend the life of copyright to \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf\">in the US </a>\u2013 life plus 70 years. If the creator is a \u201ccorporate body\u201d, the term extends to 120 years from the creation date. But what if I am a corporate body who intends to publish my work at a later date? And how can corporate bodies \u201cdie\u201d?</p> <p>Copyright law on unpublished stuff generally relates to archives \u2013 notes, diaries, rough drafts, early scripts \u2013 in analogue form. But who is to say whether Prince, <a href=\"http://www.princevault.com/index.php?title=Good_Dick_And_A_Job\">meandering through a solo song called Good Dick and a Job</a> in 1995, meant this as a first draft or a finished work? He \u201cpremiered\u201d the recording at a party on 19 May 1995 but never performed it live.</p> <p>Ask these questions and the long-term potential of Prince\u2019s strange modus operandi becomes clear. The unreleased song archive could, if his estate wants, remain artificially scarce for 120 years. It is possible to imagine that the hype will be considerable in the year 2136, when the last Prince album is released. So, behind the white walls of his Minnesota mansion, Prince may have pioneered a form of information capitalism much more sophisticated than Bowie\u2019s, and greatly more far sighted than the contracts designed by studio lawyers.</p> <p>Prince \u2013 almost uniquely among major artists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/7348551/prince-battle-to-control-career-artist-rights\">owned the masters of his recordings</a>. In the studio system, when you sell a song to a label, you get writer\u2019s royalties and performance royalties but you alienate the property rights to the master recording itself. By eschewing this, Prince \u2013 even with his published work \u2013 retained a much greater proportion of its value for himself.</p> <p>On top of that, it seems by his own admission, he \u201cdidn\u2019t always give the studio the best song\u201d. Indeed, he trailed unreleased songs by naming them in interviews and sleeve notes for the published albums. And then, having meticulously created this treasure trove, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/prince-death-will-business-assets\">he left no will</a>. He created scarcity, interest and quality in the unpublished work \u2013 but showed no interest in how it would be exploited. He even, reportedly, joked that it should be destroyed.</p> <p>Prince, in short, committed a giant act of defiance of the commercial conventions of pop music \u2013 compared with which renaming himself as a symbol mid-career looks like child\u2019s play. He knew all too well, after the 1990s, that he could have converted the whole oeuvre into a Bowie bond. But he did the opposite. He secured the property rights to his music and then just left it there, for others to work out when, where and at what price it should be commercialised.</p> <p>We live in an age when those who mediate between artists and money always want to know: who is it for? Who is the target audience? Who will pay to consume it? This is as true in TV drama, Arts Council-funded theatre and the global art market \u2013 even if the question gets asked in more subtle ways. Allied to that is the legitimate question: what will the artwork change? What is its impact going to be?</p> <p>Prince\u2019s vault reads like a top lip curled in defiance to all that. It reminds us that an artist, if they want to, can just create for themselves. And having created, they can dump the problem of what it means, what it changes and who it communicates with on to those who outlive them.</p> <p>As to money, once he had created a revenue stream from the published work sufficient for the upkeep of his quirky lifestyle, Prince seems to have lost interest in the problem of commercialising his output. That\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem now.</p>",
  "<h2>\u2018WHO ARE YOU? WHO, WHO, WHO, WHO?\u2019</h2> <p>These are strange times indeed.

After Manchester United were so thoroughly hosed by Chelsea on Sunday, the 4-0 scoreline offering not so much a clue as to where Mourinho\u2019s team are currently, as a glimpse into the echoey void <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-rages-manchester-united-incredible-mistakes-chelsea\">where his soul used to be</a>, the main question became this: what would the erstwhile winner of trophies use to distract attention from their performance? He probably couldn\u2019t have a go at an underling, because not even Mourinho plays the same song twice and anyway, that sort of thing can end up in court. Not the best idea to blame the whole thing on United having three games in seven days while Chelsea were nice and rested up, because people might then remember whose fault it is that they were free in a European week.

He did have quite a long time to mull things over, as he basically declared the game over after Pedro\u2019s first-minute goal, as though nobody had ever conceded early in a game before. In the end his solution was creative, to whisper into Antonio Conte\u2019s ear in full view of everyone, then act all coy when people asked what he had to say. Alas for Jos\u00e9 and his commitment to the secrecy of private conversations, someone was able to earwig and ascertain that he had boldly grabbed the concept of irony, torn it up, thrown it on the floor and set it on fire, as he complained to Conte about his touchline etiquette. He could not have displayed less self-awareness if he\u2019d accused Conte of wearing rubbish coats these days and not being as good as he used to be.</p> <p>The Fiver did quite enjoy Conte\u2019s reaction to this latest slice of Mourinho horse plop, regarding his rival with a vague bafflement rather than the annoyance and even anger one might expect. Conte just seemed to peer at Mourinho with a sense of curiosity, wondering exactly what this buffoon was talking about. Still, the good news is that Mourinho\u2019s attempt at deflection doesn\u2019t seem to have worked. Most people seem to be discussing his comments only in the context of how much of a berk they made him look, and devoting the rest of the time to how achingly terrible his side was.</p> <p>It might reach the point soon, if it hasn\u2019t already, that these hunks of bullsh!t are the only things remaining of the old Mourinho, the only things we have to identify the man who used to persuade players to run through fire for him. Once a fearless manager of egos and man who created thrillingly effective teams, he\u2019s now the bloke who can\u2019t work out what to do with the most expensive midfielder in the world. Nowadays his nonsense and the little JM on his jacket are among the few things that identify him, whereas they used to be mere by-products of his personality.

  "<p>It was a walk past a frozen lake 10 years ago that got Ian Tansley thinking differently about global health. The Welsh inventor had spent decades travelling and developing solar technologies throughout Africa and Asia. Yet one puzzle he was keen to crack \u2013 how to deliver vaccines on a wide-scale basis to the poorest, most remote communities \u2013 had so far eluded him.</p> <p>Vaccines are notoriously hard to deliver safely, requiring refrigeration at certain temperatures, which means having access to a constant power supply. Yet hot climates, intermittent availability of electricity, supply shortages and unreliable storage facilities mean that one in five children \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/immunization/\">more than 19m worldwide</a> \u2013 do not get even the most basic immunisations to keep them healthy.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2016/oct/24/how-sri-lanka-bit-back-mosquitoes-wiped-out-malaria-podcast\">How Sri Lanka bit back at mosquitoes and wiped out malaria \u2013\u00a0podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using the frozen lake as his inspiration, with its frozen top but liquid bottom, Tansley developed a refrigeration system, <a href=\"http://www.surechill.com/how-it-works/\">Sure Chill</a>, that harnesses water\u2019s unique properties to keep vaccines cool at 4C \u2013 yet doesn\u2019t require a constant power supply. The refrigeration compartment is surrounded by water, and relies on the fact that the liquid is at its heaviest at 4C, when it sinks. When the device has power, the water cools and forms ice above the compartment, leaving only water at 4C cooling the contents. When the power is switched off, the water warms and rises while the ice begins to melt, and water at 4C remains below to keep the vaccines chilled.</p> <p>Sure Chill \u2013 which was awarded a $1.5m (\u00a31.2m) Grand Challenges grant from the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and is now used to deliver vaccines in 38 countries \u2013 has proved a major breakthrough in global health. Tansley\u2019s immunisations cold-box can keep vaccines cool for up to 35 days in even 43C weather. And the technology is entirely scaleable, from a cool box up to a warehouse. </p> <p>Naming it one of the top four innovations saving children\u2019s lives, the Gates Foundation\u2019s director of vaccine delivery, Dr Orin Levine, calls Sure Chill <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/29/health/levine-world-immunization-week-innovations/index.html\">\u201can important tool in humanitarian response efforts\u201d</a> and says it demonstrates, for the first time in decades, a global health issue \u201cbenefiting from significant innovation\u201d.</p> <p>Innovation is the theme of this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://grandchallenges.org/\">Grand Challenges global conference</a>, taking place in London this week.

Developed by Virginia Gardiner, an American journalist-turned-industrial design engineer, Loowatt has had a massive impact in Madagascar, where a pilot public toilet project has grown to provide 100 toilets for private use within family homes, and is set to be rolled out across other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.<br></p> <p>The toilets seal waste into a portable cartridge within biodegradable film, and combine anaerobic digestion with pasteurisation in order to kill off any waterborne diseases. The waste is collected and converted into fertiliser and biogas, which is then used for cooking and electricity.</p> <p>The toilets are particularly essential in regions where waterborne diseases are prevalent, or where shared \u2013 or a complete lack of \u2013 toilets prevent women and girls from going to the bathroom, says Gardiner.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are going from having pit latrines at home to our toilets in their homes, which means they\u2019re not being exposed to eco-pathogens in their everyday lives any more,\u201d says Gardiner. \u201cThe current model can support 2,000 people \u2013 in urban or rural settings \u2013 and is important in showing that in this global sanitation crisis, there is technology out there than can convert waste into energy.\u201d</p> <p>Both Gardiner\u2019s and Tansley\u2019s systems get to the heart of what the Grand Challenges are about \u2013 improving the lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable. Tansley has been surprised at just how much his Sure Chill technology has changed the face of medical outreach. \u201cThe people benefiting the most are generally the poorest people in the most remote places, the people you just wouldn\u2019t normally see: rural agricultural communities far from any infrastructure or power grid,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re nomadic or very dispersed \u2013 they\u2019re people who weren\u2019t being reached before.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Final days of 2016 campaign defined</h2> <p>As early voting continues, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have adopted different tactics. While Trump has doubled down with raucous swing state rallies, Clinton is spending heavily on advertising, local organising and looking to help congressional candidates.

Trump advisers said the country\u2019s anti-establishment mood will work to their advantage, though as campaign manager Kellyanne Conway acknowledged to NBC: \u201cWe are behind.\u201d In Florida, Trump continued his tirade against a \u201crigged system\u201d and vowed to sue the women who have accused him of sexual assault.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/23/trump-news-clinton-poll-election-ads\">Trump camp admits \u2018we\u2019re behind\u2019 as Clinton team warns on complacency</a></p> <h2>Clinton\u2019s record as diplomat hints at presidency</h2> <p>The Democratic candidate visited 122 countries and faced crises in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, but her years as secretary of state do not provide a transparent guide to how a President Clinton would act.

The council\u2019s \u201cmaster plan\u201d is actually unclear: even the hospital doesn\u2019t know what it will use the site for yet (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/09/farm-terrace-allotment-holders-launch-campaign-to-save-nations-plots\" title=\"\">Sara Jane Trebar</a>, a Farm Terrace campaigner, thinks it will become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/17/allotments-threat-housing-cities-green-spaces\" title=\"\">68 houses and a car park for Watford football club</a>).

There are other riches there too: the businessman who arrives stressed and leaves less so; the young families who leave with children clutching sweetcorn or potatoes, now knowing that not all fruit and vegetables come wrapped in plastic; the old boys who offer advice, wanted or unwanted. Growing your own isn\u2019t always cheaper, but it\u2019s always better.

The <a href=\"http://www.nsalg.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Allotment Society</a> is more sanguine, pointing out that of the 65 of 87 applications for disposal that were granted between 2010 and 2013, most were for small bits of land for access or flood alleviation, or land that had long been disused.</p> <p>But Farm Terrace isn\u2019t disused, nor derelict, nor hideous. The case matters because it is a fight about what is of value. Of course hospitals and houses are needed. The problem with Farm Terrace is that Watford council can\u2019t see the worth of the plots, nor that a proper health scheme can be more than a community hub, shops and a bit of green space. The judicial review adjourned on Friday with no decision reached, but my grubby allotmenting fingers are crossed that peas will be given a chance. I hope that there is room, still, in our era of cat-calling, spite and profound uncertainty, for the simple, humble act that is putting your fingers into the earth, and reaping what you sow.</p>",

When I consulted him he said that I had malaria. By this time most of the villages were suffering from the disease. We had pills continuously and covered ourselves with bedsheets as we felt cold all the time. We suffered a lot and we lost our businesses and money. We went to Kurunegala to obtain medicine by hiring private vehicles as we couldn\u2019t manage ourselves to travel on the public transportation. </p> <p><strong> DR</strong> So how did Sri Lanka eliminate malaria? My name is Dinitha Rathnayake and I am a radio journalist based in Colombo. In this episode of the global development podcast I\u2019ll speak to people who lived through the 80s malaria epidemic and the doctors, health workers and officials who waged the war to eliminate the disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/sri-lanka-malaria-free-world-health-organisation\">World Health Organisation declares Sri Lanka malaria-free</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Sri Lanka\u2019s relationship with malaria has been a long one.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Sri Lanka is a country endemic to malaria and malaria has been in this country for the past many millennia probably. My name is Dr HDB Herath, consultant in public health, and now currently serving as the director [of the] Anti-Malaria Campaign. </p> <p> Historical and archaeological findings indicate that the shifting of capitals of Sri Lanka has been partly due to the foreign invasions and similar political reasons; but on the other hand, the disease malaria also helped play the important role in deciding on it.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> In the 20th century the spread of malaria continued.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> We had a massive epidemic of malaria in and around 1935 where 80,000 deaths were reported and over five million cases were reported. At that time the total population of Sri Lanka dipped down and the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, so that was a huge epidemic.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> It was around this time that the Red Cross was established in Sri Lanka. Mahieash Johnney is the senior communication manager.</p> <p><strong> MJ</strong> The British colonial government at that time wanted to fight this malaria epidemic, but they did not have the resources nor did they have the ability or the amount of people in order to go into households, go into villages, go into areas where they have been affected. Information was not available to them at hand like today. </p> <p> So it was the People\u2019s Movement \u2013 which has to go from house to house \u2013 sits down with them, explains [to] them this how you get malaria, this is how you safeguard yourself. If you have these kind of symptoms, this is exactly what you need to do.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Malaria was dramatically reduced in the 1940s after the introduction of house spraying with DDT and again in the 1950s with the launch of a national spraying programme. And according to the organisation the Anti-Malaria Campaign, by the early 60s, it had almost been totally eradicated.</p> <p> But, the success of the campaigns prompted the government to direct financial support away from prevention programmes and this, at least in part, resulted in the disease making a reappearance towards the end of the decade.</p> <p> In 1983 civil war broke out, predominantly affecting the north and east district of the country. Infrastructure in those areas crumbled and health facilities became less accessible and, as a result, the number of malaria cases rose sharply. Thelge Somapala Peris recalls his experience.</p> <p><strong> TSP</strong> In the 1980s I got malaria four times in total with a three- to four-month gap during the year. My sister was living in Polonnaruwa and she visited us. Unfortunately she too got malaria. My home town is Mathura. Most of my wife\u2019s relations visited and they all got malaria. We also might have lost our [lives] in those days but luckily we were young and we were capable [of fighting] the disease.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Kaluappuge Karunawathi and her family lived in Jaya Gaga Junction in the North Central Province. </p> <p><strong> KK</strong> We all got it in our family. My husband, me, everyone. I was so upset when my children got the disease as they were at the ages of two to three. When you get malaria you get a serious spine pain, headache, numbness in hands with fever. I couldn\u2019t get up from the bed, slept throughout the day. According to the medical doctors they gave 10 tablets to take continuously in the morning and evenings.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Dr Anula Wijesundere worked in Polonnaruwa Base Hospital from 1986 to 1989.</p> <p><strong> AW</strong> It is much better. About 35% of the wall admissions to my ward, both the paediatric and the medical ward, were due to malaria. Now these people from the hill country had no immunity from malaria at all, being in hill country. So when they came to the North Central Province which had a lot of malaria, then these new people, new settlers, developed malaria. They got severe attacks and they developed very high parasite count, and malaria became a real epidemic during this period.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> In response to the epidemic, the Anti-Malaria Campaign decided to shift their emphasis from eradication to control of the disease and launched eight regional programmes.</p> <p> Kaluappuge Karunawathi remembers what that time was like for the people who lived in her region.</p> <p><strong> KK</strong> Those days there were officers who maintained our surroundings. They made several projects to eradicate this disease. At times it was very difficult for us as the government officers came to spray kind of an oil to kill the mosquitoes every two weeks. We got to pull all our household outside the house. Patients who suffered from malaria were in queues in hospitals to obtain the specific medicine. Some of them came from afar. Some of them didn\u2019t have enough money to purchase the prescribed medicines from the pharmacy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2016/jul/26/mangroves-and-incomes-flourish-as-sri-lankas-women-promote-conservation-in-pictures\">Mangroves and incomes flourish as Sri Lanka's women promote conservation \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> People who were far came by tractors to hospitals as there were no transportation facilities. Hospital beds were overflowed with patients. Initially we were not aware that this was malaria. But afterwards we were made aware by the medical doctors that we all have got the disease malaria.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Over the course of the next two decades the programmes addressed the unique conditions for malaria transmission in each region.</p> <p> SR Jayanettti from the Sri Lanka Anti-Malaria Campaign started work in his region in 2002. </p> <p><strong> SRJ</strong> Malaria was a big public health problem during those days. One of the areas affected mainly was this area, the Nallamudawa area, because it has a unique condition for malaria transmission \u2013 because it has a lot of quarry pits and the malaria vector prefers sunlit pools.</p> <p> So we had to do lot of things. We had to control the vector, we had to treat the people, we had to conduct a lot of mobile clinics, monthly intervals and we had to follow the patients to see whether [there were] any treatment failures.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Gradually, the number of cases, at least in non-conflict areas, decreased, and Sri Lanka was able to control the spread of malaria. However the internal conflict made it impossible to reach some of the affected regions, and so it was to be a few years before a programme for elimination could begin.</p> <p> In 2009 president Mahinda <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=President+Mahinda+Rajapaksa&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD0KKRuOnPAhULB8AKHTQrAWYQvwUIGygA\">Rajapaksa</a> declared an end of three decades of internal conflict. The internal conflict had made the control of malaria a difficult task but following the declaration the ministry of health was able to launch a national malaria eradication programme. The plan was to eliminate the transmission of the deadliest strand of the disease by the end of 2012 and the most common by the end of 2014.</p> <p> The programme for malaria control was divided into three main strategies; the first was to address the vector mosquito by spraying pesticides such as DDT and malathion.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> They were cheap, they were effective but [the] acceptance rate was very low because of the smell and the colour and staining and all of these things. </p> <p><strong> DR</strong> According to Dr Herath from the Anti-Malaria Campaign the programme faced many challenges, not least the effectiveness of insecticides.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Initially what we had \u2013 the challenges were that insecticide coverage was a very difficult task, but that was later, we managed to overcome. And then the treatment, the mosquitoes become resistant to insecticides \u2013 that was another challenge. And also the parasites become resistant to the ordinary treatment and we need to find new treatment methods. And also whenever you find a new one that means [it\u2019s] very expensive. And finally those are the initial challenges.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> The next stage of malaria control involved managing the parasite through early detection of patients with the disease.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Catching as many patients as possible and treat them quickly so that the parasite will not go to the mosquito again. And also there are a number of people who are carrying the parasite but yet not developed the disease.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> And in a move which the WHO called highly effective, mobile malaria clinics were set up in high transmission areas offering prompt and effective treatment.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> We [went] to the villages and we [found] anybody who was having fever in the last many weeks or months and we took a blood film and treated them. We also did a unique thing where we got blood films from people who [were] coming to the hospital for other purposes. We said that probably we asked whether they had any fever in the past and then we took blood films.</p> <p> So [with] all these approaches we were able to gradually reduce the case numbers and then from there onwards, we had to maintain very good records because when it comes to the last minute, things need to be very carefully monitored.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/04/story-sri-lanka-civil-war-memoir-long-watch-war-captivity-return-ajith-boyagoda\">'Whatever the army saw, they destroyed': looting and loss in Sri Lanka's civil war</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> DR</strong> Although the target was set for 2014, in fact by 2012 Sri Lanka was free of locally transmitted malaria cases. Finally in 2015, with no further cases reported for three consecutive years, the WHO officially certified Sri Lanka as having malaria-free status.</p> <p> As Sri Lanka enjoys its new malaria-free status, the challenge now is how to keep it that way. Dr Herath \u2026</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Although we have eliminated the disease within the country we get, every year, about 50 patients coming from outside with malaria. That is those people who are going outside from here to other countries with malaria and then they come with malaria. And also the foreigners who are coming to Sri Lanka from malarious countries. So for that we have managed to educate our doctors and we have identified high-risk people, people who are going to malarious countries, and we check them.</p> <p> The next challenge is when the disease is no longer there, the country, the government is usually having difficulties to manage or maintain the resource flow and the disease number is going down \u2013 there is a tendency to divert the existing resources to other places. So we have to educate the policy maker and others to ensure that the resource flow is maintained until the whole world eradicates malaria.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> And Dr Anula Wijesundere believes there is a danger that not only the government, but also doctors could become complacent.</p> <p><strong> AW</strong> Because there is no malaria in Sri Lanka our doctors delay to diagnose it, to diagnose malaria. They delay it because they don\u2019t think of it. And the young doctors have not seen any case of malaria in Sri Lanka for the past five or six years. So they fail to diagnose. So one message that is very important is that if anyone comes with fever who has been abroad you have to do the blood for the malaria parasites to diagnose it early.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> You try to do more publicity internationally than locally, because internationally by doing so the world will know that the country is free of malaria. More people will come to Sri Lanka, more investors will come to Sri Lanka, and that can happen. On the other hand if you do more publicity within the country people will be also complacent. So it\u2019s a challenge. You cannot hide it also. You need to give more publicity. But on the other hand more publicity may be having a bad effect as well.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Despite the potential pitfalls ahead for now the message to the world is loud and clear.

The volume of retail sales was flat in September versus August. The fall in the pound has already generated a pick-up in inflation. The consumer prices index was up from 0.6% to 1% in the latest ONS release and is expected to trend steadily higher soon. This is especially bad news for workers whose real wages are still about 7% lower than they were at the pre-recession peak in 2007. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2016/oct/24/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-october-verdict\">How has the Brexit vote affected the UK economy? October verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Real wages have been on the rise for the last couple of years as inflation tumbled. The latest data for the month of August shows that annual wage growth, not adjusted for inflation, was 2%, down from 2.4% in July. The concern is that by the middle of 2017 prices of goods will start to rise faster than wages, lowering living standards. Unemployment is on the rise again, although it is somewhat unclear by how much because the ONS data is so bad. Estimates range from 10,000 to 144,000 on the month. </p> <p>The ONS last week published data for unemployment for the average of June to August, which it compared with the average of March to May and claimed that the number of unemployed rose by 10,000. But it seems the real jump was likely a lot larger than that. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/labourforcesurveysinglemonthestimatesx01\">Deep inside the ONS website you can find the underlying monthly data</a>. Here it is in millions. </p> <p>March: 1.73m</p> <p>April: 1.58m</p> <p>May: 1.62m</p> <p>June: 1.71m</p> <p>July: 1.55m</p> <p>August: 1.69m</p> <p><strong>Averages</strong> </p> <p>March-May: 1.64m</p> <p>May-July: 1.63m</p> <p>June-August: 1.65m</p> <p>The data shows from the latest single month estimate, which is what every other major country in the world publishes, that unemployment rose 144,000 between July and August. This may be too high, given that these monthly numbers are unstable. If you average the months together as the ONS does, then it is true that unemployment jumped by 10,000, from 1,646,000 in March-May to 1,656,000 in June-August. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t seem the right comparator. If you compare the rolling quarter of May to July with June to August, which seems much more sensible, the rise is actually a really worrying \u2013 and more believable \u2013 25,000. Whether the true rise in unemployment is 10,000; 25,000 or 144,000 the rise is bad news of course, as unemployment hurts. This is surely the lull ahead of an oncoming Brexit tsunami. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bfabff66d07ed190d6edb1dfef582c8bc63668b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bfabff66d07ed190d6edb1dfef582c8bc63668b/0_99_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man fills his car with petrol at the pumps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petrol prices are rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011:</strong><br></p> <p>Since the referendum result we have seen some mixed economic indicators.

That is now changing \u2013 with CPI inflation picking up to 1% in September \u2013 though this is the tip of the inflationary iceberg created by the recent fall in the pound. CPI inflation is set to rise to at least 2.5-3% by the end of next year \u2013 and possibly higher.

There is anecdotal evidence that businesses are becoming more cautious about investment \u2013 particularly in sectors which could be affected by the UK leaving the EU, such as manufacturing and financial services.

He says: \u201cBoth the retail sales and inflation releases suggested that price pressures are on the turn.

The government had to borrow \u00a32bn more than expected in September to balance the books, partly because of weaker tax receipts. As the outlook for the public coffers deteriorates even before the full impact of any Brexit effects takes hold, the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, faces a major challenge next month when he delivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">his maiden autumn statement</a>.

  "<p>British banker Rurik Jutting allegedly subjected a 23-year-old Indonesian woman to three days of torture that he filmed on his mobile phone before killing her and another woman at his luxury Hong Kong apartment, a court has heard.</p> <p>Jutting, 31, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/british-banker-rurik-jutting-denies-of-two-women-in-hong-kong\">went on trial on Monday</a> for the 2014 double murder of the two migrant workers. The high court judge, Michael Stuart-Moore, warned jurors they would be shown photographs and video footage that was \u201cvery shocking indeed\u201d. </p> <p>The nine jurors were told that the Cambridge-educated banker, who had worked as a trader for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, had lured the women to his home before killing them with knives.</p> <p>John Reading, prosecuting, said Sumarti Ningsih, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30110872\">a single mother from a village in central Java</a>, had agreed to go to Jutting\u2019s 31st-floor flat on the night of 25 October 2014 after being offered \u201ca large sum of money\u201d. </p> <p>Once inside, Ningsih, who was working in Hong Kong at the time, was subjected to \u201ccruel acts of violence\u201d involving sex toys, pliers, a belt and the defendant\u2019s fists, Reading said.

She had moved to Hong Kong looking for work and also used the name Jesse Lorena.</p> <p>Reading said Jutting, who went to school at the prestigious Winchester College, told police he had gone out that evening \u201chunting for prey, and that Miss Mujiasih was his prey\u201d.</p> <p>After going to Jutting\u2019s apartment, Mujiasih began to \u201cstruggle and shout\u201d after spotting a gag, the court heard.

  "<p>It has been one of the eternal questions of the Premier League era, echoing down the years as kits have got tighter and wage packets heavier. Will the bubble ever burst? Will the seemingly insatiable demand for the product ever level out? Will the thirst of giant media companies for live top-flight action in order to grow and retain their customer bases ever run dry? Will the exponential growth in TV rights income at home and abroad that has fuelled the endless inflation of the Premier League\u2019s high-octane balloon ever level off?</p> <p>Every time the question has been posed, the answer has come back ever more emphatically: no. Just as one tectonic plate appears to be shifting, another slots into place to take broadcasting income to new heights.</p> <p>The bitter competition between Sky and BT Sport, both desperately using sport as a weapon in the battle for customers across TV, broadband, telephone and mobile, plus the increasing demand across the world in an international market that is still far from sated, drove the latest Premier League TV deal beyond \u00a38.3bn over three seasons. BT shelled out almost \u00a31bn for the Champions League over the same period, while the FA has just brought in around \u00a3820m over six seasons for the international rights to the FA Cup alone.</p> <p>Received wisdom, in the US and the UK, remains that in a fracturing, splintering media landscape top-notch live sport remains one of the only types of content for which viewers will make an \u201cappointment to view\u201d. Since Rupert Murdoch famously bet the farm on Premier League football to rescue Sky&#xa0;TV in 1991, it has been the catnip that has underpinned subscriber loyalty and, even in a far more complicated media landscape, is seen as so vital as to be worth almost any price.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/premier-league-tv-football-televised\">Have you given up on live football on TV or are you just watching in other ways?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, arresting figures suggesting a decline in early season ratings have prompted an outbreak of soul\u2011searching at those broadcasters and head\u2011scratching among analysts. Early season ratings for live Premier League matches on Sky Sports are down by a fifth. On one particular Tuesday, BT Sport\u2019s Champions League figures were down by 40%. Could the unthinkable be happening? Could fans finally be turning off? This has coincided with more deep-seated fears in the US, where NFL coverage, for which broadcasters and cable carriers have collectively shelled out more than $50bn for rights into the early 2020s, has suffered a double-digit decline in viewers this season.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/nfl-ratings-just-fell-off-a-cliff-why/503666/\" title=\"\">recent article in the Atlantic magazine</a> posited four possible culprits: the presidential debates (short-term displacement of viewers), cord cutters (the phenomenon in the US of cable customers cancelling their subscriptions in favour of streaming services such as Netflix), Twitter streams (the ability to catch up with games without actually watching them) and Peyton Manning (not just him, but a perceived lack of superstars). The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, was forced on to the defensive last week. \u201cThere a lot of factors to be considered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make excuses. We try to figure out what\u2019s changing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"487994877b95a94217c2002823b54c956ebdcfae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/487994877b95a94217c2002823b54c956ebdcfae/71_12_3366_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A TV cameraman films a match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Are changing viewing habits simply leading people to watch in different ways?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Could something similar be happening here? Is this a blip or a trend? Are changing viewing habits simply leading people to watch in different ways or is the vast smorgasbord of football on offer throughout the season finally starting to give viewers indigestion as the endless stream of action becomes a blur?</p> <p>Beneath those isolated figures, the picture is inevitably a lot more complex. Sky and BT point to seasonal or one\u2011off factors that make year-on-year comparisons dangerous until later in the season. The Olympics, the weather and a comparative lack of heavyweight clashes so far this season have been cited as reasons for the drop in viewers. BT can reasonably point to the fact that matches involving teams with a smaller fanbase, such as Leicester City, in the Champions League are inevitably going to attract fewer viewers.</p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, one reason its Champions League ratings are down and its Europa League figures are up is because Manchester United are playing on Thursday nights this season. Sky says that the first genuine heavyweight clash of the season \u2013 the disappointing goalless draw between Liverpool and United on the preposterously billed \u201cRed Monday\u201d \u2013 recorded the best figures for three years, with an average of 2.8m viewers.</p> <p>Even apparently minor factors, such as the relegation of well-supported teams such as Newcastle United and Aston Villa, can have an effect on the numbers watching at home and in pubs. Both broadcasters can also reasonably point to technological and cultural shifts, which are not captured by the conventional ratings measures, as reasons why the figures are more difficult to parse than they once might have been.</p> <p>BT Sport and Sky Sports heavily promote viewing through apps available on smartphones and tablets. BT\u2019s viewing online and via its app is understood to have increased by 17% this season. In addition to pushing its Sky Go service for subscribers and an attendant new \u201cmatch centre\u201d app, Sky has focused significant investment in promoting its Now TV service. That allows non-subscribers to dip in and out of Sky Sports and other channels on a day-by-day basis and also does not feature in the headline ratings.</p> <p>Simon Green, the head of BT Sport, told the Guardian that picking out ratings on linear television on individual match nights and comparing them with last season was only one factor by which they measured success.</p> <p>\u201cViewing figures will fluctuate on a day-to-day basis and are influenced by many factors, including the team and the size of their fan base, other events happening on the day or even the weather,\u201d he said. \u201cBarb [the Broadcasters\u2019 Audience Research Board] viewing figures are just one of many ways in which we measure the success of BT Sport and only give part of the picture.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cViewing figures help us make decisions about programming and rights, but the most important measure is our overall business performance and these are reported every quarter to the City. BT is happy with the impact that BT Sport has made and the content that we are showing on the channels.\u201d</p> <p>He said the danger of stripping out figures for a single Tuesday was borne out by the fact that ratings across both Champions League nights were up on the corresponding week last season.</p> <p>\u201cViewing figures on a Champions League night will depend on which teams are playing, what the stage of the competition is and who they are playing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor match-day three we have had a cumulative sum in-match viewing figure of 2.3m versus 2.1m last&#xa0;season.\u201d</p> <p>At Sky Sports the managing director, Barney Francis, is similarly bullish, emphasising the breadth of choice provided by the broadcaster and, interestingly, pointing out that ratings in other sports \u2013 and the Football League \u2013 are up. \u201cSky Sports gives customers an unrivalled breadth of sport in a multitude of ways, encouraging them to engage with sport in the way that suits them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is demonstrated by our consumption; we\u2019ve shown the top 15 most viewed Premier League games this season including Liverpool v Man United at 2.8m average, the highest ratings in three years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f26176fa05fa7757f3f7a7002c7fc167254c9fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f26176fa05fa7757f3f7a7002c7fc167254c9fb/0_192_3894_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The BT Sport team at White Hart Lane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The BT Sport team at White Hart Lane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cViewing of F1, EFL and cricket is up strongly year on year, and The Open saw a reach of 8m on TV and 2.8m unique users online.

Could something else be going on here?</p> <p>For years, the Premier League has fought a largely beneath-the-surface war on piracy. It has waged a high\u2011profile legal battle against pubs beaming in coverage from abroad while using specialist technology companies to try to close down illegal streams at source.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/30/chris-sutton-football-angry-pundit-bt-sport\">How Chris Sutton became the king of football\u2019s cinematic miserablists | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But now that just about every household has fast enough Wi-Fi to make streaming illegal streams to a phone, tablet or laptop a reality, that effort feels increasingly like the modern equivalent of sticking a finger into a leaky dyke.</p> <p>Up to now, a concerted effort by Sky and BT to ensure that they provide their subscribers with enough quality and breadth to make streaming illegally just too much hassle, combined with the fact their numbers have continued to grow regardless, has made it another dog that has failed to bark. But if those who have shelled out more than \u00a35bn for domestic rights start to feel that their ratings are being compromised, expect them to put more pressure on the rights owners to do something about it.</p> <p>Of course, for BT and Sky the only real metric that matters is whether people are giving up their subscriptions. If viewing patterns fluctuate and fans snack on football in different ways that is fine by them \u2013 as long as those supporters are still shelling out every month and are happy with the breadth and range of content and technology on offer.</p> <p>Even more difficult to analyse is whether cultural factors are having an effect. Clearly, the internet, social media and video games are having an effect on the way that younger fans in particular interact with the game.</p> <p>Are younger people watching football in a different way? Is the sport now so all-pervasive that actually watching a full match is becoming a tedious inconvenience if the relevant action and talking points can all be absorbed via osmosis on Twitter and other social media channels?</p> <p>That might seem an extreme analysis, and certainly the sanctity and thrill of the live occasion remains for most fans, but it is one that Sky clearly recognises \u2013 for the first time this season, the broadcaster is pushing out selected goal clips for nothing over Twitter as matches take place. But the theory gives rise to an intriguing thought experiment \u2013 could the very ubiquity of the modern game, its endless noise and hype, eventually start to eat away at the exclusivity that has fuelled its growth over the past two decades. In short, will it finally eat itself? More likely is that fans will continue to make an \u201cappointment to view\u201d for the biggest matches but that they could become fewer and further apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/bt-sport-score-afternoon-viewers-soccer-saturday\">BT Sport make their play for Saturday afternoon football viewers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it could also be true that as the market becomes ever more complex and austerity continues to bite, more viewers will start to feel that the amount they shell out every month to gorge on sporting action is an expense too far and look at ways to mitigate it - whether that is switching to an a la carte service such as Now TV or taking their chances with a streaming service.</p> <p>In a recent note, the media analysts Enders said that the same factors that were driving US \u201ccord cutters\u201d were not present to the same extent in the UK. It doubted that the same dynamics existed in the UK market and recent results from Sky and BT showed continued growth.</p> <p>There is certainly no sense of panic from the Premier League\u2019s headquarters in Gloucester Place, with the overall feeling being that it is far too early to judge whether the early season numbers are a blip or a trend.</p> <p>And yet, beneath the bullish exterior, senior broadcasting sources are also starting to quietly question whether rights owners are doing their bit in return for the billions poured into sport since the satellite television revolution began in the late 1980s. On both sides of the equation \u2013 rights owners and broadcasters \u2013 the stakes have been raised to almost unimaginable levels. What happens next will be fascinating. Stay tuned. Or not.</p>",
  "<p>Owen Farrell is in a striking mood today. It is almost surprising to compare how relaxed and amiable he appears in contrast to the intense and often fiery man who plays for Saracens and England. There is a new lightness to Farrell, at least in the comforting surrounds of Saracens\u2019 training ground in St&#xa0;Albans, and it is only when transcribing his words that it becomes clear how a concentrated ambition beats even more strongly inside him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jun/27/how-british-irish-lions-may-line-up-new-2017-zealand-tour-england-scotland-wales-ireland\">How the British &amp; Irish Lions may line up on 2017 New Zealand tour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the chit-chat about his love of watching sport on television and moving out of home so he can be looked after by his girlfriend, the recurring theme is obvious. It resonates so often that I count 16 separate occasions when Farrell uses the words \u201cimprove\u201d, \u201cimproving\u201d and \u201cimprovement\u201d, or the short phrase of \u201cget better\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAll we\u2019ve ever tried to do is get better,\u201d Farrell says as he shrugs off a compliment for the way in which, 10 days ago, on his return from injury, he inspired Saracens to subject Toulon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/toulon-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">to a rare lesson in attacking rugby</a>, and sealed the French club\u2019s first home defeat in the European Champions Cup. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re good at but we want to improve in every area of the game. We did well against Toulon but we were a long way from perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell scored 16 points and his coach Mark McCall, who described him as the best player in Europe before the match, said: \u201cThe way Owen played was remarkable.\u201d On Saturday, in his second game since injuring his back in pre\u2011season training, Farrell kicked 19 points, and created so much space for his backline, as Saracens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/23/saracens-scarlets-champions-cup-alex-goode\" title=\"\">completed a 44-26 European thumping of Scarlets</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy giving this everything,\u201d Farrell says simply as he relishes playing again. \u201cIt\u2019s an obsession of mine and something I love doing.\u201d</p> <p>That second sentence contains the crux of Farrell\u2019s approach while explaining how he has dealt with the tumultuous past year. Last October Farrell and English rugby were at a terrible low point after their humiliating World Cup. Twelve months on, following a grand slam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/australia-england-third-test-match-report\" title=\"\">and a 3-0 series whitewash in Australia</a>, they have won 10 Tests in a row. Eddie Jones, the coach who sparked the transformation, hails Farrell as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/england-dylan-hartley-australia-whitewash\" title=\"\">solar-system class</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0771ffedb9d489143502a025bf9e193a19869d1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0771ffedb9d489143502a025bf9e193a19869d1a/0_769_3648_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Farrell of Saracens surveys the scene after the victory over Toulon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"947\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Farrell of Saracens surveys the scene after the victory over Toulon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five months ago Farrell also won the Premiership and European Cup double with Saracens but success has sharpened his appetite. Past disappointments also underpin these achievements. Farrell remembers how, two years ago, he and Saracens endured a double blow. A week after they were crushed in the European Cup final by Toulon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/31/northampton-saints-beat-saracens-premiership-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the Premiership title was snatched away</a> when Northampton were awarded a controversial try in the last minute of extra-time.</p> <p>\u201cThe disappointments probably make the big wins happen in the first place,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the lows make the highs more meaningful. They actually help you figure stuff out. You have to work out where you went wrong and what you need to do to get better. We\u2019ve done that at Saracens and obviously things have changed at England. The main thing is that we\u2019ve&#xa0;improved.\u201d</p> <p>The old southern hemisphere jibe \u2013 that England are satisfied too quickly by a few wins \u2013 is redundant in Farrell\u2019s company. As the autumn internationals loom with Tests against South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia, Farrell talks plainly: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go. We\u2019re by no means anywhere near where we want to be. Our improvement is exciting but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/rugby-union-talking-points-european-champions-cup-action\">Rugby union: talking points from the weekend's Champions Cup action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any temptation to get carried away is curbed by the history-making All Blacks. On Saturday New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/new-zealand-make-history-beat-australia-all-blacks-18-consecutive-wins\" title=\"\">became the first team to win 18 Tests in a row</a>, beating Australia 37-10, and the gulf between them and every other rugby\u2011playing nation is obvious. Yet Farrell sounds more inspired than intimidated. \u201cThey\u2019re a brilliant side and brilliant to watch. Obviously every team is different and you don\u2019t want to try and be them. But you\u2019ve got to figure out your own way and work hard to get to that level. I saw them against South Africa [when New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-33rIhWPVA\" title=\"\">scored nine tries while hammering the Springboks in Durban</a>] because you watch every big game and try to learn from it. New Zealand were very good. It was a clinical performance and that\u2019s the standard they\u2019ve set.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has been measured in analysing England\u2019s progress. He also enjoys his reputation as a coach whom his own players often fear. Does Farrell feel any trepidation? \u201cWhat you feel more than anything is that you want to perform. You want to do well for him. He works hard to create that environment. And we try to create it as a team \u2013 so you drive yourselves.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want this to come across the wrong way \u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s comfortable playing for [Jones]. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to ease off.\u201d</p> <p>Before he began working with Jones had he heard about the Australian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/eddie-jones-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">reducing some hardened Test forwards to tears</a>? \u201cYou always hear stories but I can only speak from my experience. I was here when Eddie was at Saracens [as a consultant in 2006]. I was a young lad in the academy. I actually played my first game at Saracens under him \u2013 against Scarlets. We lost.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b725df85cc430daee90804a110104fc75f15630b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b725df85cc430daee90804a110104fc75f15630b/0_90_1746_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Farrell makes his Saracens debut against Scarlets in October 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"960\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Farrell makes his Saracens debut against Scarlets in October 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farrell smiles as he recalls how, in October 2008, 11 days after turning 17, he became the youngest player to appear for an English Premiership club when Saracens picked him in an Anglo\u2011Welsh Cup fixture. \u201cI remember those times with Eddie really well. He was brilliant with me. Really brilliant. My experience of him then and now has been great.\u201d</p> <p>Jones can still be brutal. He picked Farrell at fly-half against Australia in June but, after 29 minutes, with Luther Burrell struggling defensively at inside centre and England 10-0 down in the first quarter, Jones made a dramatic substitution. Burrell was taken off, George Ford was sent on and Farrell moved to centre. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/11/australia-england-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">England won 39-28 and Farrell scored 24 points</a>. The early replacement seemed cruel to Burrell but, in the blunt terms of Test rugby, it was justified.</p> <p>\u201cI guess it did surprise me,\u201d Farrell says. \u201cWe spoke about it afterwards but that\u2019s what needed to be done. Thankfully we ended up winning. You don\u2019t like to see that happen but while you\u2019re playing you just go: \u2018Yeah, right, let\u2019s get on with it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t want this to come across the wrong way \u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s comfortable playing for [Jones]</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In all Jones\u2019s other matches as England coach, Farrell has started at inside-centre. He retains the No10 shirt at Saracens. Does he prefer his club position? \u201cI\u2019d say so. I\u2019d say I am a fly\u2011half. As regards being 12 for England I\u2019ve not tried to play any different. I guess I\u2019ve been like another 10. Obviously you do some things differently and you might not have your hands on the ball as much \u2013 but you\u2019re still in the game and constantly communicating. You\u2019re happy to fit in wherever you\u2019re wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Any frustration Farrell feels at not being picked in his favoured role is offset by the pleasure of playing in a winning team with his close friend. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great. Me and George have played alongside each other a lot. We did all the age groups together and we\u2019re very open about how we see the game. We talk to each other and it works well.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell and Ford have similar backgrounds \u2013 the sons of rugby league men [Andy Farrell and Mike Ford] who became respected union coaches after moving from the north and ending up in the leafy Hertfordshire town of Harpenden. Apart from playing rugby together every day, either at St George\u2019s School or in the street, Ford sometimes did Farrell\u2019s French homework.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably cleverer than me so he would help me out,\u201d Farrell quips, \u201ceven though he was the year below me. So I like playing alongside George. The main thing is I\u2019ve tried to get better at everything \u2013 that includes the attacking side, being a threat and taking people&#xa0;on.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell has endured enough bruising defeats to make him a rounded player \u2013 but his team-mate Maro Itoje has yet to learn the same harsh lessons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/maro-itoje-saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final\" title=\"\">In his sensational first full season</a> with Saracens and England, Itoje did not lose a single game he started.

He also went to St&#xa0;George\u2019s and ever since he\u2019s been at Saracens the most impressive thing about him is that he\u2019s took everything in his stride. He\u2019s never been in awe of anything. It doesn\u2019t matter who is in front of him, he thinks he can dominate them. He might not even think like that \u2013 he might just do it.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell and Itoje are likely to be important figures for the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand this season. Farrell is understandably more comfortable talking about the 2013 tour of Australia than speculating on his possible role against the All Blacks. \u201cI loved it,\u201d he says of the last Lions series. \u201cIt was brilliant \u2013 especially as we won. I only got on at the end [as a substitute in the decisive third Test] but to be involved in the whole thing and to play with some special players was incredible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/23/saracens-scarlets-champions-cup-alex-goode\">Saracens close in on European record but Alex Goode seeks improvement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Has he allowed himself to think ahead to New Zealand? \u201cNot at the minute.

The accord creates voluntary crop substitution programmes to ensure that alternatives are sustainable from an environmental and economic point of view. Substitution plans must include actions for the mitigation of environmental damage in areas of special environmental interest and for forest recovery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/09/the-phrase-economic-development-has-bad-associations-in-latin-america\">The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>New resources, new challenges</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2016/6/23/La-paz-oportunidad-para-el-medio-ambiente-en-Colombia.html\">According to the UN</a>, war has limited the economic development that Colombia can achieve thanks to its biodiversity. It is also true that the areas that face the most intense conflict are areas of great biodiversity like Choc\u00f3. At the same time, they face great economic need and state neglect. Peace opens an opportunity for these areas to exploit their natural resources in a way that does not enrich illegal groups nor corrupt politicians. This is the opportunity to take advantage of the land to create and implement sustainable tourism programmes and other forms of economic development that do not solely depend on resource extraction, but on their preservation and responsible use to offer a better quality of life to vulnerable and low-income communities.</p> <p>Much has been said about the economic dividends of peace. Colombia spends approximately <a href=\"http://datos.bancomundial.org/indicador/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=truehttp://datos.bancomundial.org/indicador/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=true\">3.4% of its gross domestic product</a> in defence. It is the Latin American country that spends the most on this sector. Although freeing this public budget does not directly mean that there will more economic growth or better social spending, it does open an opportunity to redirect this money to education, health, and environment. According to the government, peace can result in an <a href=\"http://thomsonreuters.com/en/articles/2015/reuters-newsmaker-interview-colombia-president-santos.html\">increase of 1.5%</a> in GDP and 5% to 8% in the regions most affected by conflict.</p> <p>Some of these issues are being contested under the renegotiation process following the vote, particularly the rural reform. If the government and the guerrilla can agree to go ahead with an accord that includes the elements of the original agreement discussed above, it is possible to reinvent the environmental governance of the country. The great challenge then from now on will be how to manage resources in a responsible and proactive fashion. In order to advance towards sustainable development, strengthening of institutional capacity, monitoring, transparency in implementation, and accountability should all be central components in a post-conflict scenario.</p> <p><em>The piece was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.nivela.org/articles/la-paz-en-colombia-una-oportunidad-clave-para-un-desarrollo-sostenible/en\">Nivela</a>. </em></p> <p><em>Camila Bustos is a lead researcher and </em><em>Marcela Jaramillo is a policy adviser on climate finance at Nivela.

Existen muchas razones ecol\u00f3gicas para alegrarse del acuerdo de paz: una de las m\u00e1s importantes es la posibilidad de reducir la deforestaci\u00f3n; tener mayor control sobre la restauraci\u00f3n, recuperaci\u00f3n y conservaci\u00f3n de \u00e1reas ecol\u00f3gicas (tales como parques naturales y <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1ramo\">p\u00e1ramos</a></em>); la otra es crear una econom\u00eda m\u00e1s sostenible, eficiente y diversificada.</p> <p>El impacto de la guerra sobre las riquezas naturales de Colombia ha sido enorme.

De igual modo, dicha pol\u00edtica incrementar\u00e1 las oportunidades de los colombianos para asumir las responsabilidad del manejo de los recursos naturales en su pa\u00eds.</p> <h2><strong>Empoderar a los agricultores</strong></h2> <p>Para beneficiar a las comunidades rurales m\u00e1s afectadas por la negligencia del estado y el conflicto, el acuerdo crear\u00e1 un fondo de tierras. El fondo contar\u00e1 con 3 millones de hect\u00e1reas de tierra durante los primeros 10 a\u00f1os a partir de su creaci\u00f3n.

Aunque el conflicto ha contribuido a la deforestaci\u00f3n y la destrucci\u00f3n de ecosistemas, tambi\u00e9n ha limitado la explotaci\u00f3n de recursos como la madera, miner\u00eda y agronegocios en varias \u00e1reas rurales y de dif\u00edcil acceso, muchas de las cuales caracterizadas por una alta biodiversidad.</p> <p>En otras partes del mundo, la migraci\u00f3n interna posconflicto ha llevado a una mayor presi\u00f3n sobre los recursos naturales y, en muchos casos, un incremento en la deforestaci\u00f3n.</p> <p>En este sentido, el acuerdo establece que la reforma deber\u00e1 garantizar la sostenibilidad socio-ambiental.

Al mismo tiempo, existen zonas que sufren grandes carencias econ\u00f3micas y la negligencia del estado. La paz abre una oportunidad para que \u00e9stas exploten sus recursos naturales de modo que no enriquezcan a grupos ilegales ni a pol\u00edticos corruptos. Esta es la oportunidad para aprovechar la tierra, para crear e implementar programas de turismo sostenible y otras formas de desarrollo econ\u00f3mico que no s\u00f3lo dependan de la extracci\u00f3n de recursos, sino de su preservaci\u00f3n y uso responsable para ofrecer una mejor calidad de vida a las comunidades vulnerables y de bajos recursos.</p> <p>Se ha insistido mucho sobre los dividendos econ\u00f3micos de la paz.

  "<p>Craig Baxam was lost. He thought he was in a town in northern Kenya called Marareme, though really he didn\u2019t have a clue. He then got on a bus headed to Garissa, towards the Somali border, but was puzzled by the way the other passengers referred to it as \u201cArara\u201d.<br></p> <p>Baxam was far from home, spoke no local language and knew little about the region he was traveling through. If he were successful in reaching southern Somalia, his destination, things would almost certainly get worse for him: the war-torn country, where he planned to live according to his faith, remains one of the most inhospitable and perilous on Earth. </p> <p>Yet none of that flustered him. All he wanted was to keep on moving towards the border. Find it, cross it and begin a new, better, devout life.</p> <p>Baxam, 24 at the time, had thrown to the winds his comfortable existence in Laurel, Maryland, where he worked for a TV services company. In December 2011 he cashed in his thrift savings plan account (all $3,613.38 of it), gave $1,000 of that to an acquaintance in need, and with the rest bought himself a ticket to Nairobi. He had decided to set out on a hijrah, a migration to a true Islamic land, as he was instructed to do in the Qu\u2019ran.</p> <p>To say that this was all new to Baxam would be an understatement. A black American raised Catholic who had recently discharged himself from the US army after four years of service, he grew up with no connection to the Muslim faith. But five months before his trip, he went through a dramatic and sudden conversion after stumbling on a religious website. </p> <p>Barely half a year later, he was making his way north through Kenya into the vast unknown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/somalia-terrorist-carpenter-al-shabaab\">Somalia: one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s carpenter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he travelled, Baxam kept his head down, stopping merely to eat and pray at mosques. He had good reason to be careful: he was heading towards one of the world\u2019s most anarchic conflict zones in a country that had been in the throes of an extreme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/04/somalia-al-shabaab-insurgency-mogadishu-mohamed-nur\">Islamist insurgency</a> for several years. </p> <p>Once inside Somalia, he planned to live under al-Shabaab \u2013 a group designated by Washington as a terrorist organisation which practices a very strict form of Islam under the religious law of sharia. </p> <p>The stakes were high. US and Kenyan authorities worked closely together to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/15/foreign-troops-in-somalia-struggle-to-keep-al-shabaab-at-bay\">intercept</a> any movement across the border from al-Shabaab members, and Baxam had a taste of those security efforts as he sat on the bus going north. He later told the FBI there were posters all along the route telling people to contact police should they see anyone acting strangely. He must have looked suspicious himself, he said, given what was about to happen.<br></p> <p>Soon after the bus pulled out, a man boarded and gently began asking Baxam questions. Where was he going? Did he speak the local dialect? Was there family nearby? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a53d4e9e91c84f261770d6e2f099caf0526a578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a53d4e9e91c84f261770d6e2f099caf0526a578/0_0_2021_2441/828.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam with his mother Deanna in November 2015.\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam with his mother Deanna in November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baxam thought to himself: I\u2019m in luck, here\u2019s someone who wants to help me. It didn\u2019t quite turn out like that. Not long after, the bus was surrounded by Kenyan police who swarmed onboard and took him away on suspicion of terrorism. </p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At 7am on a Monday, 11 days after Craig Baxam was hauled off the bus, the phone rang at Deanna Baxam\u2019s house in Atlanta, more than 8,000 miles away. It was the Baltimore field office of the FBI. Her son, she was told, had been detained in Kenya and was in a Nairobi jail. </p> <p>That was all they said. Nothing about how long he\u2019d been held, where he\u2019d been, or what treatment he had endured.</p> <p>The following day, 4 January 2012, two FBI agents from the Atlanta division came knocking on Deanna Baxam\u2019s door. They asked whether she was willing to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket home. When she inquired whether he had been charged with any crime, they said no, so she readily agreed, thinking Craig would soon be back with her.</p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018We would like to bring him home to you, but you have to pay the airfare.\u2019 So I gave them my charge card and they put a $3,000 ticket on it,\u201d Baxam said in the course of a three-hour interview with the Guardian in her home in the Atlanta suburbs.</p> <p>On 6 January 2012, she began the long drive to Maryland to meet her son as he flew into Baltimore Washington international airport. She was apprehensive, but happy he was safe and coming home. But somewhere on the interstate, another call came in from the FBI. Craig\u2019s plane had already landed, they told her. He had been re-arrested as he set foot on US soil and taken off to a federal institution. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3148000-Indictment-1.html\">charged</a> with attempting to provide material support to al-Shabaab, the designated terrorist organisation, and informed that he faced a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. </p> <p>Of all the many things that have happened to Deanna Baxam since that day, having the FBI asking her to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket so he could be flown into the waiting claws of the US justice system perhaps hurts the most.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very angry about that. They used me as an American citizen, had me spend private funds to conduct law enforcement activities on behalf of the FBI. That\u2019s not the worst of it. The worst of it is this: my government screwed my son and made me pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>She may not have realized it fully at that time, but Deanna Baxam had just been sucked into one of the defining conflicts of the modern age: religious fundamentalism versus the US national security apparatus. </p> <p>On the one hand, she now had a son who professed to be a devout Muslim and who felt such a fierce commitment to his newly discovered faith that he was prepared to leave his family and radically change his life to practice it. On the other hand, she also had to deal with seemingly duplicitous anti-terrorist agents within the FBI who were bearing down on her child with the full might of the world\u2019s only superpower. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me</p> <footer> <cite>Deanna Baxam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was caught between two utterly bewildering worlds, and her initial reaction was one of disbelief. This didn\u2019t happen to a family like hers. \u201cI thought our family did everything right, everything that would keep us out of the government\u2019s clutches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Deanna was born in Nebraska, a US citizen, but she was raised in Jamaica to Jamaican parents. She returned to the US after completing her chemistry degree and went on to marry Carl Baxam, an American Trinidadian who worked for a defense contractor. They had two sons, the youngest of whom, Craig, was born in 1987.</p> <p>There was always something special about Craig, she said. He was creative, outgoing, smart. He also had an obsessional quality, as smart kids often do. Passions would flare up, burn brightly and then fizzle out in quick succession. \u201cOne day when he was about 10, he wanted to learn Hangul, so he visited our Korean neighbors every day \u2013 he was a real pest. That was typical: he wanted to learn the piano so he would go at it for days and days, and then it was done.\u201d</p> <p>Along with that intensity came what she describes as a purist streak. \u201cThere was no grey for him: it was either black or white, right or wrong. Nothing in between. When things were shoved into the in-between, he couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>There were other difficulties. He once said to his mother he thought he had attention deficit disorder, though she couldn\u2019t see it. He also took the divorce of his parents badly. They separated when Craig was eight years old and a few years after that Deanna moved away from Maryland to New Jersey, leaving her son largely in the care of his father. </p> <p>The internal struggle reflected itself in Craig\u2019s education. He flunked out of college before the end of freshman year, and then flunked out of community college. Deanna kept asking him what he was going to do with his life, a question which he answered, to her shock and dismay, by signing up for the US military. He enlisted in 2007, telling Deanna that he wanted to defend America in the wake of 9/11. After eight months\u2019 training in advanced cryptology and intelligence, he was posted to Baghdad. </p> <p>Until he joined the army, Craig had been what his mother describes as \u201cvery clean. Didn\u2019t drink or do drugs. Never. He had never been in trouble of any kind and had no criminal convictions or arrest record.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what happened to him in Iraq \u2013 to this day he refuses to talk about it \u2013 but she does know that he came back a changed person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e/0_346_1372_1945/705.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam at Goodfellow air force base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me. I still don\u2019t have him back. I raised nice, middle-class children, sent them to music lessons, Catholic school, and then he just came back different.\u201d </p> <p>Having never smoked, Craig now consumed cigarettes, marijuana and K2 (synthetic marijuana, which at the time of his arrest was a legal substance). He began drinking heavily, another first.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam is convinced her son displayed classic PTSD symptoms. In between flashes of anger, he was withdrawn and disconnected. She had made his bedroom welcoming for his homecoming, but instead of sleeping in the new bed she\u2019d bought for him, he insisted on lying on the floor with his head on his service bag, as though he were still in the war zone.</p> <p>He signed up for one more tour of duty, this time to South Korea. The night before he was dispatched, she recalls that Craig would not move from a chair in the kitchen. \u201cI went to bed, and I left him sitting there in the chair in the dark all night. That wasn\u2019t right. There was something bad going on.\u201d</p> <p>Amid all this turbulence, Craig Baxam turned to the Muslim faith that was to become his salvation and his undoing. </p> <p>While stationed in South Korea, he began exploring religions. He would send his mother emails asking existential questions such as \u201cdo you believe there\u2019s only one God?\u201d or comparing Christianity with Islam. She was impressed and glad he was nurturing his spiritual side.</p> <p>But when he got off the plane on his return in July 2011, she knew something major had happened. He had grown a beard and was wearing a kufi and robe. She was stunned, and let it show. \u201cOh my God, what happened to you? Why would you even travel looking like that?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m a Muslim now,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>She ran out of the airport, sat on a bench and cried.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the faith that distressed her: they had raised their children to be believers, and Deanna Baxam herself is a Pentecostal Christian. It was the feeling of abandonment.</p> <p>\u201cFaith is important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we raised them in a certain tradition, so to have him leave Christianity was like a rejection of the family. I was angry about it for a long time. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m as devout as you are, but we are on different tracks and you are separating our family.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>According to an <a href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1874.pdf\">affidavit</a> given by an FBI agent, Craig Baxman converted about a week to 10 days before he quit the army in South Korea. There seems to have been no grooming involved by any individual or organization: Baxam had been surfing the internet and had come across a website that talked about the Day of Judgment \u2013 it spoke to him and made him hungry for more. Almost instantly he was praying five times a day and devouring books on Islam.</p> <p>Back in the US, he regularly tried to convert his own mother, too. Sometimes he would say to her: \u201cMom, I respect your right to have different faith, but I\u2019m worried you are going to hell when you die.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to be as accepting as she could, hoping that his new obsession would fade away. It didn\u2019t. In December 2011 she got a call from Craig\u2019s father saying that her son had disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9db3dd80a964c3d58a557fa3c369e9afc9b85f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9db3dd80a964c3d58a557fa3c369e9afc9b85f/0_0_4483_3225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A copy of the Initial Entry Training Soldier\u2019s Handbook belonging to former US soldier Craig Baxam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A copy of the Initial Entry Training Soldier\u2019s Handbook belonging to the former US soldier Craig Baxam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bita Honarvar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/04/somalia-al-shabaab-insurgency-mogadishu-mohamed-nur\">Al-Shabaab</a> is one of the world\u2019s most feared Islamist militant groups. Since Craig Baxam\u2019s attempt to live under its control, the extremists have carried out some of the most brutal terrorist attacks in living memory, including the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-hostage-westgate-nairobi\">Westgate mall attack</a> in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed.<br></p> <p>The group emerged in about 2006 out of the anarchy and chaos that has gripped Somalia, a \u201cfailed state\u201d. At the time that Baxam was making his way through Kenya, carrying only a few hundred dollars in his pocket, a prayer mat and a copy of the Qu\u2019ran, al-Shabaab militants<strong> </strong>were being forced out of the Somali capital Mogadishu but were still in control of large swathes of the south of the country.</p> <p>It was these al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia that Craig Baxam was determined to reach. Using the internet, he had identified three places in the world where, in his view, a Muslim could conform fully to the tenets of his new religion under sharia law. <br></p> <p>The trio of locations that he chose as his possible future havens are among the harshest environments \u2013 both physically and spiritually \u2013 on the globe. They were the Taliban-controlled parts of Afghanistan; the southern islands of the Philippines, where an extremist group was trying to gain a foothold on Mindanao; and the al-Shabaab parts of Somalia.</p> <p>US prosecutors presented in court documents a psychological profile of Baxam in which they alleged that he had been aware of al-Shabaab\u2019s terrorist designation and the insurgency it was actively fighting at the time within Somalia. Based on interrogations with him while he was held captive by Kenyan police with FBI agents in attendance, they claimed that he had become hostile towards America, which he regarded as oppressive to Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cTo live as a Muslim in the US you need to compromise,\u201d the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit said, paraphrasing Craig Baxam\u2019s alleged position. \u201cHe finds the constant playing of music and display of pictures disrespectful. Only Allah can create images.\u201d</p> <p>The affidavit went on to allege that Baxam was prepared to take up arms and fight against the US if it attacked al-Shabaab:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Baxam saw himself dying in Somalia. It might be from malaria or from being hit by a rocket. Only Allah could know. Baxam never intended to return from Somalia, he was \u2018looking for dying with a gun in my hand\u2019. He would be happy to die defending Islam; being mowed down or hit with a cruise missile. If someone dies defending Islam, they are guaranteed a place in Jannah [paradise].</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s impossible to really know what was going through Craig Baxam\u2019s head as he was making his fateful journey. In a recent letter to the Guardian from his current prison cell in Beaumont, Texas, he declined to be interviewed, writing that \u201cdespite the grief the US government has caused me, I am a private man and I also consider what happened to me to be far more insignificant than other cases\u201d.</p> <p>But there are clues that suggest that the US prosecutors\u2019 account of his intentions was overblown. The federal judge assigned to the case, Frederick Motz, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147999-OrderReBillofParticulars.html\">cast doubt</a> on the state\u2019s claim that Baxam had terrorist inclinations. </p> <p>\u201cAccording to what he told FBI agents,\u201d Motz wrote in a court memo, \u201cit appears to me that defendant had not formed an intention to fight for al-Shabaab in any offensive capacity when he travelled to Somalia. To the contrary, all the statements seem to reveal is that defendant wanted to live in a Muslim country under Sharia law and that if the country in which he was residing was attacked, he would then defend that country.\u201d </p> <p>For Deanna Baxam, the account given by the state \u2013 that her son was a callous terrorist-sympathiser intent on betraying his own country \u2013 just didn\u2019t ring true. As she sees it, it was his innate purist streak that was leading him on, not any political sensibility. \u201cHe believed that the Qu\u2019ran says that if you live in an oppressive regime where Islam is not in control, like America, then you should make hijrah.

There were the 11 days between her son\u2019s arrest on the bus in northern Kenya, and his return to US soil \u2013 what happened in that period, how many times was he interrogated, and what role did the FBI play in the process? Why were none of the interrogations recorded on tape so that the FBI\u2019s account of what her son told them could be verified?<br></p> <p>She is alarmed by the fact that her own government deployed its considerable resources to track and detain her child on foreign soil. Instead of providing him with the care he needed as a disturbed veteran who had seen tours of duty in Iraq and South Korea and displayed symptoms of PTSD, they left him to his own devices.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this stuff happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThey track US nationals in Kenya? To say I\u2019m outraged doesn\u2019t seem enough of a response. When you are a US national overseas I thought the job of the government was to help protect you, not to collaborate with the Kenyan authorities in tracking you down.\u201d</p> <p>She is also dismayed by what she believes was the willful denial of her son\u2019s first amendment right to practice his religion. \u201cAmerica has a history of interning the Japanese, of persecuting people because of their religious beliefs. How is that different here? How can we imprison somebody who has no demonstrated guilty intent or action \u2013 there was none of that? And yet he is rounded up and sent to prison.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Baxam was sentenced in January 2014 to seven years in prison, with five years of post-prison supervision added on. The sentence flowed from a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147998-Plea-Agreement-Baxam-Copy.html\">plea bargain</a> in which the US government agreed to drop the main terrorist charges against him in return for a guilty plea to a lesser charge: that he had knowingly disposed of records that could be used in a terrorism investigation. Before leaving for Kenya, he had destroyed his personal computer and thrown it in a dumpster, allegedly to foil any future FBI probe.</p> <p>Today, Craig Baxam, now 29, is approaching his fifth anniversary behind bars, some of which time he has spent in solitary confinement. </p> <p>His father, Carl Baxam, lost his job with the defense contractor after 24 years of loyal service once news of the case broke. Carl died last year while Craig was still in prison.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam had to change the church in which she worshipped because she felt stigmatized by others in the congregation. She lost a few corporate contracts as a lawyer, as well as some professional friendships, after people dropped out of sight without saying a word. </p> <p>She says she still wrestles with the fallout of it all. She travels to visit her son whenever she can, and they exchange letters regularly. In his correspondence and phone calls, Craig continues to talk about Islam fervently, and makes clear that his long-term goal remains to live under sharia law, though no longer in Somalia. </p> <p>He signs his letters \u201cEsmail the American\u201d. In them, he\u2019ll weave in and out of a discussion of his faith. Allah will appear in one sentence, a joke about his mother\u2019s basketball team the Chicago Bulls the next. From time to time, he\u2019ll make another stab at getting Deanna to convert to Islam. </p> <p>As a mother, she has had to accept that there\u2019s a side to her son that is now beyond her reach. \u201cThere is a part of me that says, \u2018How could this have happened, what would make you so driven that you would want to go and live with al-Shabaab?\u2019 I can\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p> <p>She has tried to reach out to other mothers in her position, so far without success. \u201cPeople want to stay underground,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, who wants to be known as the \u2018mother of a terrorist\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>If she had the chance to send a message to other mothers like her, trapped between religious fundamentalism and an overweaning government, what would she say? </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018You are not alone. What has happened to you is beyond your imagination. But you are not alone.\u2019\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 25 October 2016 to correct the spelling of Craig Baxam\u2019s father\u2019s surname.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>No billionaire owner, no shareholders.

The trust warmly welcomes you.<br></p> <p>In my 13 years as chair, I have witnessed many developments. The flexibility of the trust deed has allowed us to change everything, from the name of the paper (the Manchester Guardian became the Guardian in 1959) to the medium in which we publish (print on paper to electronic words and moving pictures); from the basic business model (a single UK newspaper to a global media business) to the definition of a journalist, which now embraces the two-way relationship of a digital news operation.</p> <p>We have even turned the trust itself into a company to safeguard its purposes into the future. The trust has had its highs \u2013 stopping the sale of the Guardian to the Times at one particularly low ebb in our fortunes, buying the Observer, supporting a far-seeing editor in the vanguard of digital technology and bringing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations</a> to light. The lows have mostly been of a financial nature.</p> <p>At times, we have needed to be quick on our feet, but the deep foundations of trust values, purposes and priorities leave me in no doubt that, in our bones, we haven\u2019t changed.</p> <p>When I joined the Guardian, the company consisted of one print-on-paper newspaper that lived by selling display and classified advertising, and being read by a few hundred thousand people in the UK, plus an abridged version, Guardian Weekly, that was treasured in a handful of liberal outposts abroad.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"197bf584b39dae0c8c507569bb3da9cdd8753be6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/197bf584b39dae0c8c507569bb3da9cdd8753be6/2062_427_1512_1889/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Graham\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Graham, the new chair of the Scott Trust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thirty eight years later, the Guardian is a paper, an app, a video producer, a sister paper, a weekly paper, and three online operations consumed by millions all over the world on platforms some of us have never heard of, with quality, public-interest journalism at our core. </p> <p>It is therefore a good moment for the appointment of the first Scott Trust chair who has never worked at the Guardian \u2013 though he is, of course, a devoted and lifelong reader.

  "<p>After 14 years of sexual harassment at work, Idihar Chaieb finally got her day in court. The widow had been repeatedly propositioned and groped by her boss, who was also a local official in her home town of Menzel Bouzelfa, an hour\u2019s drive from Tunis. When he finally got the message that Chaieb wasn\u2019t interested in his advances, he threatened to destroy her reputation.</p> <p>\u201cI was afraid to speak out.

Chaieb was fired from the company where she had worked for 25 years; her former boss demanded a letter of apology. She was left devastated and destitute.<br></p> <p>Chaieb\u2019s story is not untypical in Tunisia. Despite its reputation for being the most progressive country in the Arab world on women\u2019s rights, with <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tunisian-parliament-passes-bill-set-bring-more-women-power-1706934906\">almost one-third</a> of parliament consisting of female MPs and more than 700 civil society organisations working on gender issues, violence against women and sexual harassment are endemic.<br></p> <p>Almost half of women aged 18-64 \u2013 47.6% \u2013 had experienced some form of violence, according to a <a href=\"https://www.aub.edu.lb/fm/shbpp/ethics/Documents/violence-against-women-Tunisia-Majed-Zemni.pdf\">2010 survey</a>. There is little evidence that the situation has improved since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/14/tunisian-president-flees-country-protests\">uprising</a> that ended the dictatorship of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and led to a democratically elected government.<br></p> <p>However, this month Tunisia\u2019s parliament is debating a bill to strengthen legislation on violence against women. Championed by <a href=\"http://www.ennahdha.tn/\">Ennahdha</a>, a conservative reformist party with Islamic roots and a clutch of dynamic female MPs and officials, the bill is expected to be passed by the end of 2016.<br></p> <p>The proposed law, which would be incorporated into other legislation and government policies, would introduce sweeping definitions of gender-based violence, covering psychological and economic harm in both the public and domestic spheres. Marital rape would be outlawed and there would be an end to impunity for rapists if their victims are under 20 and they subsequently marry them. Penalties for sexual harassment at work would be increased and police officers and hospital staff trained in gender issues.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women want a chance to say what happened, how it destroyed their lives, how they were rejected by society</p> <footer> <cite>Ibtihel Abdellatif, Truth and Dignity Commission</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The scope of the bill may challenge western stereotypes of Islam, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/23/tunisia-women-revolution\">Mehrezia Labidi</a>, an Ennahdha MP and chair of the parliamentary women\u2019s committee, said: \u201cWe see no contradiction between Islam and protecting women\u2019s rights. We have a progressive reading of Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Sayida Ounissi, 29, another Ennahdha MP and secretary of state for entrepreneurship in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29828706\">coalition government led by the secular Nidaa Tounes party</a>, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have conservatives like us saying violence against women is not acceptable. Some conservatives might argue that the state should not interfere in the private space [of the family], but when a person\u2019s physical integrity is harmed, the state needs to step in.\u201d<br></p> <p>Tunisia may have a better record on women\u2019s rights than other countries in the region, \u201cbut we compare ourselves to international standards\u201d, she added.<br></p> <p>Tunisia is a country of contradictions when it comes to women\u2019s rights. Free abortion and contraception are available, and women have equal rights in marriage, divorce and property ownership. In 2010, one-third of judges and more than four in 10 lawyers were female; <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/01/is-tunisia-the-beacon-of-womens-rights-it-claims-to-be/\">in 2013, 30% of Tunisia\u2019s engineers were women</a>.<br></p> <p>In 2014, three years after the revolution, equal opportunities were enshrined in a new constitution. Political parties were required by law to alternate men and women on electoral lists, ensuring substantial representation in parliament. In April 2014, Tunisia lifted its reservations to the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/\">UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a>.<br></p> <p>But in socially conservative towns and villages, men and women continue to follow traditional roles. The word of a woman usually carries less weight than that of a man when accusations of sexual or domestic violence are evaluated, according to <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde30/2814/2015/en/\">an Amnesty report</a>.<br></p> <p>Women who have been raped or sexually assaulted are often seen as bringing \u201cdishonour\u201d to their families. Victims of domestic violence are frequently pressed to drop complaints for the sake of family unity and reputation.<br></p> <p>Though recognised as a specific crime since 1993, family violence is widely accepted as \u201cnormal\u201d. In 2012-13, two-thirds of the 5,575 complaints of marital violence lodged with the authorities were withdrawn or dismissed; only 10% resulted in convictions. The police may refuse to investigate complaints and allegations \u2013 and sometimes they are the perpetrators.<br></p> <p>Siham Beji knows this all too well. The 51-year-old grandmother was attacked by three police officers on the street early one morning in May 2012. They beat her, breaking her jaw, and took her identity papers, a watch and a bracelet. Then they kept her in a police cell for three days. After a court appearance, in which the officers claimed she had been drunk and attacked them, Beji was fined and spent a further three days in prison. No medical attention was offered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c96b9b91e19537b3bc66915bbd9e430c60ad0aad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c96b9b91e19537b3bc66915bbd9e430c60ad0aad/38_100_489_294/489.jpg\" alt=\"Siham Beji\" width=\"489\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siham Beji: \u2018I became another person after the attack\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Sherwood/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, with the help of the <a href=\"http://femmesdemocrates.org.tn\">Association of Democratic Women</a>, she brought a case against the men. A year after the attack, the officer who broke her jaw was sentenced to three months in jail; the other two got three days for their part. All three are still serving police officers.<br></p> <p>\u201cI became another person after the attack,\u201d said Beji. \u201cI completely changed. I became aggressive, and I get upset and angry easily.\u201d She said her family blamed her for the episode. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to kill myself seven times.\u201d<br></p> <p>Violence meted out to women by the police and security forces stretches back to the early days of the dictatorship. The <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/06/09/tunisia-launches-truth-and-dignity-commission.html\">Truth and Dignity Commission, established by the post-revolution government</a>, has received 15,000 complaints from women who were raped, tortured and degraded under the regimes of Ben Ali and his predecessor, Habib Bourguiba.<br></p> <p>According to Ibtihel Abdellatif, the body\u2019s commissioner for women, the number does not reflect the scale of violence against women. \u201cFor every man put in jail, be sure there were at least four women who were also victims \u2013 mothers, wives, sisters, daughters,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cMen coming out of prison were seen as heroes, they were respected in their communities. But for women who were sexually abused, there was a terrible stigma. Many girls coming out of prison weren\u2019t accepted back into their families. There are women who have never told their husbands what happened.<br></p> <p>\u201cMany who have come to us say they don\u2019t want reparation, they just want a chance to say what happened, how it destroyed their lives, how they were rejected by society. The impact on women was much greater than the impact on men.\u201d<br></p> <p>The commission is attempting to deal with the past; the violence against women bill aims to give greater protection in the future. But the politicians promoting it hope for something more than legislative change.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t change people\u2019s lives simply by passing a law,\u201d said Labidi. \u201cWe change lives by education, raising awareness, changing the language around violence against women.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Ounissi: \u201cPassing the law is the beginning of the process, not the end. You need the support of the education system; this starts at school. You need a training programme for the police. And you need to look at television shows that normalise violence. People are more influenced by what\u2019s on television than what\u2019s in a parliamentary bill.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94e555e655b3d1772cfd1903ce302bf0a606da0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e555e655b3d1772cfd1903ce302bf0a606da0b/4_52_570_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"Idihar Chaieb\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idihar Chaieb: \u2018I hope justice will be done\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Sherwood/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ounissi, the daughter of an imam added: \u201cThe mosques also play a major social role. These people are public servants, they are paid by the state \u2013 so we need to get the ministry of religion involved. If we can monitor imams for signs of radicalisation, we can monitor them for what they say on domestic violence. I don\u2019t think it will be difficult.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Ennahdha party was historically labelled \u201cIslamist\u201d, but six months ago it ditched that description in favour of \u201cMuslim democrat\u201d. The move, which followed a three-year process, was overwhelmingly supported at Ennahdha\u2019s congress last spring. The movement draws comparisons with European Christian Democratic parties, saying its new label reflects a forward-looking democratic reformist party rooted in Islamic values.<br></p> <p>Ennahdha \u2013 now a partner in the coalition government \u2013 expects the violence against women bill to win strong parliamentary support, although some compromises may be required before a final vote.<br></p> <p>Amna Guellali, senior Tunisia researcher at <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a>, said the bill was a \u201ccomprehensive framework for fighting violence against women\u201d. All state institutions were mandated to incorporate it but \u201cits practical impact will depend on a willingness of the state to provide the means of implementation. In Tunisia we have a tradition of passing good laws, but the reality on the ground is more complicated,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>For Chaieb, any move that strengthens the rights of women is to be welcomed. Her story has taken a turn for the better since she lost her case against her predatory boss.</p> <p>Women\u2019s organisations helped her financially by investing in a small grocery shop she opened, and by finding her a lawyer prepared to act on a pro bono basis. In March, Chaieb returned to court, and this time her former boss was found guilty of sexual harassment and fined 25,000 dinars (\u00a39,000).<br></p> <p>A further appeal is yet to be heard, and Chaieb has not received any money. \u201cBut what happened to me has been recognised,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope justice has been and will be done.\u201d<br></p>",

That's scary\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born to a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father, 31-year-old Rubinos questions the limitations that other people put on her identity, including the artistic ghettoisation she experiences when her music is labelled \u201cLatin\u201d. Such pigeonholing flattens her sound\u2019s wild abandon and ambition. She graduated from the prestigious Berklee College Of Music with a degree in jazz composition, got her start playing DIY house shows in her Brooklyn apartment, and is currently signed to ANTI-, a division of punk label Epitaph. Indeed, on Black Terry Cat, she thrashes as hard as Shellac, flows like Erykah Badu, and matches the strut of classic Daptone records. Because of this, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating when I feel someone\u2019s not listening and just looking at my face or name and assuming.\u201d</p> <p>That miscategorisation, coupled with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, inspired Rubinos to investigate her own heritage while writing Black Terry Cat. Tracing her roots back to her Spanish grandfather and African great-grandmother, she began defining as Afro-Latina (rather than the disputed ethnonyms Latino and Hispanic). She says she wasn\u2019t aware of that designation when she was younger, but a surge in Latin media has finally offered proper representations of her background; even listicles about \u201cthings you only know when you have a Puerto Rican grandma\u201d help, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c08f887dbe7b031d571387b6110ec8632302a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c08f887dbe7b031d571387b6110ec8632302a55/0_275_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xenia Rubinos on stage in Bilbao, 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xenia Rubinos on stage in Bilbao, 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t see myself [re]presented in media in any kind of way that was relatable or authentic,\u201d says Rubinos. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to have these things now to help me navigate my experience.\u201d</p> <p>Since its release, Black Terry Cat\u2019s themes have felt ever more pressing. The emotionally frantic Black Stars was inspired by the death of Rubinos\u2019s father after complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, but she says its lyrics took on extra meaning after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. The week we speak, there are reports of police killing more unarmed black men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. But, Rubinos says, it\u2019s just as limiting to call her a \u201cpolitical artist\u201d as it is to call her a Latin one. \u201cBecause I\u2019m saying things about being a brown girl in America, suddenly it\u2019s a protest album,\u201d she says dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m just talking about real shit that\u2019s happening around us.\u201d She references Nina Simone: \u201cShe was socially engaged and wrote a lot of provocative songs, but she was a great composer, a great pianist, a great vocalist.

  "<p>It\u2019s been another turbulent month in the long-running saga over the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Having looked as if she might be <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/28/green-light-for-hinkley-point-as-new-18bn-nuclear-plant-approved/\">contemplating a rethink</a>, Theresa May <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/09/15/new-era-of-uk-nuclear-power-as-hinkley-point-finally-gets-go-ahe/\">unveiled an apparently decisive approval</a> just before the Conservative Party conference. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-accused-backing-down-hinkley-point-c-deal\">But with longstanding issues still unaddressed</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/frances-nuclear-power-stations-at-risk-of-catastrophic-failure/5548593\">and new problems emerging even since the PM\u2019s announcement</a> \u2013 the debate over Hinkley is far from over.</p> <p>Now might be a good moment, then, to reflect on the contribution that social science can make to these kinds of controversies over science and technology. Of course, what counts as useful in any given controversy will depend on your perspective. It is inherent to democracy that different values and interests yield contrasting conclusions. This is especially so over deeply-fractured faultlines like those which run through the <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/36890\">UK\u2019s commitments to nuclear power</a>.</p> <p>Social science can provide a better understanding of why different perspectives disagree \u2013 and help (when possible) to identify common ground. Hard-pressed policymakers often find it useful to understand how to foster trust, confidence and \u201cacceptance\u201d of their institutions and procedures.</p> <p>For powerful interests in any setting, social research can also play a useful role in helping to justify, present or implement favoured policies. Here, social science can be part of the closing down of debate \u2013 helpfully enabling political attention to move on.</p> <p>But what if, on deeper reflection, powerfully-backed policies are a bad idea (perhaps as with the Hinkley decision? History is replete with examples \u2013 like asbestos, heavy metals, carcinogenic pesticides, chlorine bleaches, toxic solvents and ozone depleting chemicals \u2013 where it only emerged in retrospect that the pictures being given of \u201csound science\u201d or the \u201cevidence base\u201d at the time were unduly shaped by vested interests or constrained imaginations.</p> <p>It is here that social science can play a further crucial role: helping <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08c6ce5274a31e00011ee/1052734439-stirling.2005-opening.pdf\">to open up policy debates where they are being prematurely \u201clocked-in\u201d.</a> This focuses less on society as a target for policymaking, and more on the processes of policymaking themselves. The production and interpretation of evidence is, after all, as much a social phenomenon as public attitudes or political mobilisation.</p> <p>It is a striking feature of the Hinkley example that even <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/internal/bulletin/staff/2015-2016/16092016/hinkley-approval-defies-logic?ref=email\">the government\u2019s own evidence base is strikingly damning</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/556917/3_-_Value_for_Money_Assessment.pdf\">assessment of value for money</a> itself acknowledges Hinkley C to be more expensive than other low carbon energy strategies. <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf\">And the picture in other official sources is even more negative</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-costs-up-to-37bn\">With nuclear costs rising and renewable costs falling</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf\">and a worldwide turn towards wind and solar power</a> \u2013 global trends compound the picture.</p> <p>With the UK enjoying the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48128/2167-uk-renewable-energy-roadmap.pdf\">best renewable energy resource in Europe</a> and holding a <a href=\"http://www.greeninvestmentbank.com/media/44638/osw-pitchbook_ukti_june-2015.pdf\">competitive advantage in offshore industries</a>, industrial policy arguments are also manifestly stronger for renewables. <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2988060/if_its_jobs_they_want_labour_and_the_unions_must_back_renewables_not_hinkley_c.html\">The same applies to prospective jobs</a>. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/08/nuclear-energy-security-risk/\">Compared to nuclear safety and security challenges, renewables are less vulnerable</a>. And simplistic \u201cbaseload\u201d arguments are shown by numerous official reports to be superseded by technology \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.energypost.eu/interview-steve-holliday-ceo-national-grid-idea-large-power-stations-baseload-power-outdated/\">repudiated even by the National Grid</a>. So the officially-stated reasons for nuclear enthusiasm simply don\u2019t stack up.</p> <p>The contrast with Germany is especially strong. Here, arguably the world\u2019s most successful industrial power <a href=\"https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00585316/document\">had a nuclear sector far larger and more successful than that of the UK</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.energy.eu/publications/a07.pdf\">much less attractive renewable resource</a>. Yet it is Germany \u2013 with a record of far-sighted industrial policy decisions in the past \u2013 that has made the opposite move to the UK: <a href=\"http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Topics/Energy/energy-transition.html\">an \u201cEnergiewende\u201d towards renewable energy</a>, in contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/leading-the-way-the-uks-new-nuclear-renaissance\">British \u201cnuclear renaissance</a>\u201d.</p> <p>So, here emerges another role for social science: critical interrogation of what lies behind the official picture<a href=\"https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=2015-18-swps-johnston-stirling.pdf&amp;site=25\">. Our own recent research on the Hinkley question</a> suggests the best way to understand this continuing commitment \u2013 and the contrast with Germany \u2013 lies in the relative <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-germany-is-dumping-nuclear-power-and-britain-isnt-46359\">qualities of the two democracies</a>. The post-war German constitution, and a more critical political culture, makes it easier for Germany to resist incumbent industrial interests and ease itself out of lock-in.</p> <p>And our research suggests there is a further \u2013 seriously neglected \u2013 factor that may underlie the intense attachment of successive UK governments to civil nuclear power. This involves <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/36984#.V-TshqU2QSY.twitter\">parallel UK commitments to maintain nuclear submarine capabilities</a>. Without the cover provided by lower-tier contracts in civil nuclear construction, the diminished UK nuclear manufacturing sector would simply not be able to build these formidable technological artefacts. Nor could they easily be operated without civil infrastructures for nuclear research, design, training, maintenance and regulation.</p> <p>So a consequence of withdrawing from nuclear power might also be very serious for <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/media/politics/documents/research/Trident_and_British_Identity.pdf\">a particular version of British identity</a> \u2013 especially in the coming post-Brexit era. It is nuclear military prowess that supposedly allows the UK to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35566480\">\u201cpunch above its weight\u201d</a> on the world stage. Yet, although this rationale for continued UK nuclear commitments is clearly documented on the military side, it is unmentioned anywhere in official civil nuclear policy statements \u2013 and in energy debates more widely.</p> <p>What this might mean for policy is a moot point. But by opening up this kind of wider discussion, social science can undertake its trickiest \u2013 but arguably most useful \u2013 task in any controversy. The stakes in this particular case transcend nuclear debates alone \u2013 and raise questions about the overall health of British democracy.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/328393\">Phil Johnstone</a> is a research fellow and <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/7513\">Andy Stirling</a> is a professor of science and technology policy at the <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/\">Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU)</a>, University of Sussex.</em></p>",

On Saturday, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, promised to block it because it would \u201cdestroy democracy\u201d. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, said he was \u201cpro-competition\u201d.</p> <p>The companies\u2019 bosses announced late on Saturday night that they had signed a deal \u2013 the biggest corporate takeover of the year \u2013 which was a \u201cperfect match\u201d of firms to \u201cbring a fresh approach to how the media and communications industry works\u201d.</p> <p>The deal, unanimously approved by both companies\u2019 boards, values Time Warner at $107.50 a share \u2013 a 20% premium on its closing price on Friday. It unites a historic phone company that traces its roots back more than 130 years to Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, with the producer of some of the world\u2019s most popular movies and TV shows, including Veep and Game of Thrones.</p> <p>AT&amp;T and Time Warner would have combined market value of more than $310bn. If the deal goes through and the companies aren\u2019t forced to sell assets, it would have AT&amp;T\u2019s assets of more than 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-TV subscribers through DirecTV, which AT&amp;T bought for $50bn in 2015, as well as Time Warner\u2019s extensive collection of Hollywood movies and TV channels and productions. Time Warner owns Warner Brothers (Harry Potter and Batman) as well as HBO, CNN and DC Comics. It also holds a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T\u2019s chief executive, who will lead the combined company, said the corporate tie-up would transform consumers\u2019 experience of watching media on their phones at a time when many young people are giving up on pay TV. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe premium content is always going to win,\u201d he said, on a late night conference call announcing the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s been true on the big screen, the TV screen and we believe it is true on the mobile screen.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we combine Time Warner content with our scale and distribution \u2026 we\u2019re going to have something really special.\u201d</p> <p>The deal faces the prospect of a tough battle with politicians and regulators fearful that such a tie-up could lead to less consumer choice, higher prices and a possible threat to media plurality.<br></p> <p>Trump has vowed to block the deal if he wins next month\u2019s election.

Earlier this month she vowed to \u201cstrengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinise mergers and acquisitions, so the big don\u2019t keep getting bigger and bigger\u201d. </p> <p>Kaine told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m pro-competition. Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon later told reporters there were \u201ca number of questions and concerns\u201d about the deal but said that more needed to be known \u201cbefore any conclusions should be reached.\u201d </p> <p>Al Franken, a Democratic senator for Minnesota and regular critic of other cable and media tie-ups, said: \u201cI\u2019m skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices and even worse service for consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, said in a joint statement: \u201cAn acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Lee later said a hearing would be held sometime this year.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are also likely to review the deal, which comes shortly after cable provider Comcast took full control of NBC Universal. It is expected that the combined AT&amp;T/Time Warner group will have to promise to provide competitor content the same access to its customers as its own content.</p> <p>Disney executives have called for \u201cvery close regulatory scrutiny\u201d of the deal. </p> <p>Stephenson, who said he hoped the deal would be completed next year, said he did not expect any significant challenge from regulators as AT&amp;T is not buying up a direct competitor but adding to its business by purchasing a supplier. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not a horizontal deal. This is vertical merger,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to find examples where vertical mergers have been blocked.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/person/21/craig-aaron\">Craig Aaron</a>, president of the consumer watchdog Free Press, said the deal would concentrate a \u201chuge amount of media power under one corporate umbrella\u201d and would likely lead to less customer choice and higher prices. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hear lots in the months ahead about supposed benefits, but history shows that mega-deals like this lead to higher prices, fewer choices and too much power in too few hands,\u201d he told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cWall Street pushes these deals for short-term gains but they\u2019re ultimately bad for business, larger economic growth and especially content creators and consumers. This deal will be a huge test about whether the next president is serious about antitrust. If they are, they\u2019ll move to block this deal.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/richbtig\">Richard Greenfield</a>, a media and technology at research firm BTIG, said the deal showed that Time Warner believes \u201cthe entire legacy media world is headed [for] secular decline\u201d.</p> <p>He said Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chairman and chief executive, would end up being remembered as \u201cthe smartest CEO in sector \u2013 knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/03/time-warner-buys-stake-hulu\">Time Warner buys 10% stake in Hulu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bewkes, who turned down an $85-a-share takeover approach from 21st Century Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/24/rupert-murdoch-time-warner\">two years ago</a>, said he would stay with the company for a handover period before stepping down.

  "<p>Hello guzzlers,</p> <p>Martin Gardner, who wrote dozens of books of recreational mathematics, would have been 102 last Friday. In the years since he died, his friends and fans have started a global movement called <a href=\"http://www.celebrationofmind.org/wordpress_site/\">Celebration of Mind</a>, which encourages people to put on puzzle-themed events on or around the date of his birthday. </p> <p>Please celebrate your minds right now by attempting these two gems from Gardner\u2019s archive. One is straightforward. The other may take you a little longer.</p> <p><em>1. At the hardware store, you are told that 1 will cost you 50p, 12 will cost \u00a31 and the price of 144 is \u00a31.50. What are you buying?</em><br></p> <p><em>2. Reconstruct the following long division:</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb1c5ef8c71c1011dbaff2a26d760b0773b93f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb1c5ef8c71c1011dbaff2a26d760b0773b93f4/572_621_665_494/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the long division of an eight digit number by a three digit number. All the digits in both numbers - and the workings out - have been replaced by Xs. Not only do you need to work out what digits the Xs are, you also need to calculate the answer, which is a five digit number with the 8 in its third position.</p> <p>The puzzle was one of Gardner\u2019s favourites.

  "<p>It\u2019s a hot sunny day in mid-September and Gareth Malone is wearing a green felt Christmas tree on his head. \u201cThe more you sing this carol like you\u2019re singing to granny at home,\u201d he tells the London Youth Choir, \u201cthe more heartfelt it is \u2013 and the more the microphones will pick it up.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s best known choirmaster is making a Christmas record in Abbey Road studios. But, true to his roots, he is also doing it in the community. In fact, he\u2019s doing it in lots of communities: in Cornwall with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCRadioCornwall/videos/1294045967286221/\">Perranarworthal Hand Bell Ringers</a>; in Birmingham with its <a href=\"http://www.birminghamcommunitygospelchoir.co.uk/\">Gospel Choir</a>; and in Wales with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-35275802\">Coed Eva</a> primary school (whose building was burnt down in an arson attack on New Year\u2019s Eve).</p> <p>Over the past decade, Malone has shown he can transform pretty much any group of no-hopers into a decent choir. In <a href=\"http://www.garethmalone.com/programmes/boys-don't-sing\">Boys Don\u2019t Sing</a>, he took a bunch of Leicester schoolboys who hated the idea of singing in a choir and nine months later had them performing at the Albert Hall. Then there was <a href=\"http://www.garethmalone.com/programmes/sing-while-you-work\">Sing While You Work</a>, in which P&amp;O saw off the likes of Sainsbury\u2019s and Cheshire Fire Service to become Britain\u2019s top workplace choir. Most famously, in 2011 he took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/20/the-choir-military-wives-reality-tv\">Military Wives</a> to a Christmas No 1 with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0hR6O7VxKaQ\">Wherever You Are</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hR6O7VxKaQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0hR6O7VxKaQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0hR6O7VxKaQ\">The Military Wives sing Wherever You Are</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Malone is a boyish 40, with the air of a children\u2019s TV presenter, part Simon Cowell, part social worker and part teacher. The son of a civil servant mother and bank manager father, he grew up in Bournemouth and did a drama degree at the University of East Anglia. \u201cI thought I was going to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-branagh\">Kenneth Branagh</a> in Henry V, that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Malone was convinced he would conquer the world, that he would make his name as an actor, a director or a singer \u2013 and, if things worked out well, all three. But his ambition was not matched by his talent or dedication. \u201cI had moments of realisation at university. I saw other actors and thought, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re a bit more dedicated and a bit more serious and a bit better than me.\u2019 So that was a little knockback. I think I had the same with directing: there were these people who had a singlemindedness about what they wanted to do that I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He took a postgrad in classical singing at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music \u2013 passing with a distinction \u2013 but again he felt he was lacking. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a huge operatic voice. It\u2019s a smallish instrument. The people who get picked up tend to be the ones with opera-sized voices.\u201d To even stand a chance, he says, he would have also had to show unwavering commitment for six to eight years. \u201cIt\u2019s like brain surgeon-type commitment. A lot of my friends who I was in college with are just starting their careers now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68bd4de9a2bb547464d9032a0b994a4b895f5bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68bd4de9a2bb547464d9032a0b994a4b895f5bd4/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malone in the recording studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malone in the recording studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I came out of school cocksure and confident \u2013 I thought I was marvellous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So he returned to Bournemouth, worked in a bar and sold ice creams on the beach. He was at a bit of a loss. \u201cOne day, a friend of my parents called and said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen an advert for a youth worker to work with young teenagers and I think you\u2019d be really good at it.\u2019\u201d Malone applied, got the job, and it changed his life. He worked with disadvantaged youngsters, encouraging them to take an interest in music, and he saw a world he had been oblivious to. </p> <p>\u201cI would teach them to play bass guitar, try to organise them. I found it deeply traumatic in some ways, because it was my first realisation that people had not had the same advantages I had. People would tell you their parents were on drugs or whatever and I found it difficult to deal with because I was young and didn\u2019t know much about the world.\u201d Was he naive? \u201cYes, I was sheltered till I was in my 20s.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63bb38a3495d973d6a83c7e56f18cd168ecffd72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63bb38a3495d973d6a83c7e56f18cd168ecffd72/0_67_2051_1231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the first series of The Choir, pupils from Northolt High School competed in the World Choir Games in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the first series of The Choir, pupils from Northolt High School competed in the World Choir Games in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the youth work, he got a job with the <a href=\"http://lso.co.uk/\">London Symphony Orchestra</a> running its youth and community choirs and <a href=\"http://lso.co.uk/lso-discovery/about-lso-discovery.html\">working in inner-city schools</a>. \u201cI got a real kick out of seeing teenagers you\u2019d never expect getting involved in classical music.\u201d The experience knocked some of the arrogance out of him. \u201cIt was quite humbling. I came out of school fairly cocksure and confident \u2013 I thought I was marvellous.\u201d</p> <p>Disappointment had given him a new perspective: he now regarded himself more as an enthusiastic amateur than an unheralded divo. He certainly did not see community work as a stepping stone to a career in TV. I read that his wife Becky, an English teacher with whom he has two young children, said that he had grim prospects when they met and she took him on as a project. \u201cOh, what a lovely thing to say!\u201d he says. \u201cI think she spotted potential, but I wasn\u2019t like a high-flying city lawyer with bags of cash. I was a bohemian with grand plans. I think she felt I\u2019d always do something but she didn\u2019t know what. Then this TV thing came up and it just clicked.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbaab9282baac7118a1bddab462028e84f8b6c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbaab9282baac7118a1bddab462028e84f8b6c09/1085_238_1852_2594/714.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Malone leads a session\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Malone leads a session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2006, he was invited to make a series for BBC2, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2006/dec/05/youreviewthechoir1\">The Choir</a>, in which he taught choral music to teenagers. And everything fell into place. The skills he had learnt over the years \u2013 acting, directing, singing, teaching, mentoring \u2013 all played a part in this new career. I ask what he thinks makes him good on TV. He ums and ahs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m certainly not camera-shy.\u201d He also says his bossiness comes in useful. \u201cI\u2019m a back-seat driver in life. You know, \u2018You might want to turn the oven down to three.\u2019 Back-seat baker, cook, organiser, back-seat everything. I have always got an opinion on how I\u2019d like things to be.\u201d</p> <p>Older women, including my mother, tend to adore Malone. She says what she loves about him is that he is an enabler: giving people the confidence to do things they wouldn\u2019t have dreamed they were capable of. A great example is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008y102\">Boys Don\u2019t Sing</a>, the BBC2 series Malone cites as his favourite. \u201cI just lived and breathed it for nine months, in and out of that school every day trying to make it work. It was the joy of going from not knowing what we were doing to standing on the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for the first time in my life with 150 people \u2013 and it working. I was really proud of that performance.\u201d</p> <p>What makes him particularly proud is that he was working with schoolboys. Why do they tend to be resistant to choirs? Malone says it\u2019s a such complex issue, involving masculinity, biology and language itself. \u201cYou\u2019re always struggling to prove it can be as manly and as cool as football and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox\">Xbox</a>. The term boy is quite complicated in relation to music. We talk of boy bands, but they are actually young men.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You're alway struggling to show that singing can be as manly and cool as football</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd the changes that occur to a young man\u2019s voice are very traumatic. We don\u2019t deal with that very well. We always talk about boys\u2019 voices breaking and of course they don\u2019t break. It\u2019s a source of anxiety for so many men. They say, \u2018Oh, I sang in a choir and then my voice broke and I stopped. What happens when something breaks? You throw it away and get a new one. Well, you can\u2019t get a new voice, so a lot of men just fall out of love with their own instruments.\u201d </p> <p>Does he never get bored with the TV formula of turning dross into gold? He looks surprised. No, he says, he loves it. \u201cI like performing and working with people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/simon-rattle\">Simon Rattle</a> doesn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019ve played in all the big halls in the world, so I\u2019ll stop now.\u2019 You keep going on and learning. Every scenario is different.\u201d</p> <p>Would he be tempted if a good acting offer came along? He nods. \u201cI\u2019d be the right kind of nervous I think.\u201d He grins. \u201cI should be careful because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street\">Coronation Street</a> will call me up and I\u2019ll be the resident choirmaster!\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c01ffd45cd12eb4847ec3c18277d45af9287170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c01ffd45cd12eb4847ec3c18277d45af9287170/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rio gold-medal hockey star Helen Richardson-Walsh sings with London Youth Choir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great buzz \u2026 Rio gold-medal hockey star Helen Richardson-Walsh sings with London Youth Choir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For now he\u2019s focused on the task in hand \u2013 getting the best out of the <a href=\"http://www.londonyouthchoir.com/\">London Youth Choir</a>, whose female singers are here today, as well as four of Team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/gb-women-hockey-historic-gold-shootout-final-olympics\">GB\u2019s gold-winning women\u2019s hockey team</a> (who tweeted him to ask if he would teach them how to sing the national anthem properly).

That is a <em>lovely</em> sound!\u201d He\u2019s virtually jumping with excitement as they sing Oh Holy Night.

Brilliant. We did it. Hurrah. Right, one more take</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He tells the girls: \u201cThe point of this verse is it\u2019s an end to slavery. Oppression is <em>the</em> word. Oppression is when people are put down. When it says oppression shall cease, that\u2019s a <em>big</em> deal. It\u2019s a really important verse, so let\u2019s try again.\u201d And next we see Malone the perfectionist. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got pretty much everything. I\u2019d just like two more takes. Maybe three. Here we go!\u201d</p> <p>Malone is in his element working with all ages and abilities. \u201cLadies of the hockey team, I suggest we stick you slap bang in the middle.\u201d As the dark draws in, they work away at O Come All Ye Faithful, with Malone gently ticking off the more experienced singers for overshadowing the others, complaining that some words are indistinct, and suggesting they harden \u201cLord\u201d. Finally, he seems happy.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely killer,\u201d he shouts. \u201cBrilliant! We did it! Hurrah!\u201d The choir and hockey players look relieved and happy \u2013 for all of one second. \u201cRight,\u201d says Malone, \u201cone more take.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Choir: Gareth\u2019s Best in Britain starts on BBC2 on 1 November. <a href=\"http://www.garethmalone.com/cddvd\">A Great British Christmas</a> is released on Decca Classics on 2 December. </p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Dozens of MPs have signed a joint letter, organised by a group that aims to hold leave campaigners to their pre-referendum promises, which calls on the government to uphold the most infamous Brexit promise of all \u2013 \u00a3350m more a week to be spent on the NHS.</p> <p>The letter, signed by 41 MPs, mainly from Labour but also some Liberal Democrats and Caroline Lucas of the Greens, demands that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, make the pledge in his autumn statement a month from now.</p> <p>The \u00a3350m pledge was a key element of the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s promise to voters, billed as money that would be saved after leaving the EU which could instead go to health spending.</p> <p>In the wake of the 23 June referendum many leading pro-Brexit figures began to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\">distance themselves from the idea</a>, a process highlighted in a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz0FTqTzn89sTlRSWmpqQWVCY3M/view\">new Vote Leave Watch video</a> to accompany the letter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/boris-johnson-nhs-extra-funds-after-brexit-andrew-marr-lansley\">Boris Johnson says NHS will get substantial extra funds after Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month it emerged that a successor group to Vote Leave, Change Britain, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">not included the pledge among its aims</a>.<br></p> <p>The letter, addressed to Hammond, noted that the chancellor\u2019s speech to the Conservative party conference earlier this month said that \u201cthe message of the referendum result had been \u2018received, loud and clear\u2019 by the government\u201d.</p> <p>The letter continued: \u201cWe accept the verdict of the British people.

Vote Leave promised that, if Britain left the EU, \u00a3350m a week extra would be spent on the NHS. They travelled the country in a bus which said: \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350m a week, let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\u201d In the press conference suite at their London headquarters, a large sign read: \u201cLet\u2019s give our NHS the \u00a3350m the EU takes every week.\u201d</p> <p>The foreign secretary, the secretary of state for international trade, the secretary of state for the environment, the secretary of state for transport and the secretary of state for international development all appeared in photo opportunities featuring these messages.

Behind the scenes, vehicle makers have pushed strongly for a staggering 300% over, according to material seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The draft regulation is still being discussed by EU member states and the auto industry has not given up hopes of wrenching further concessions on particulate emissions ahead of a final decision on 7 December. </p> <p>One Powerpoint slide shown to EU expert groups by the European automobile manufacturers association (Acea) says that a 300% latitude in meeting the letter of the law would be \u201crealistic\u201d because of \u201cmeasurement uncertainty\u201d in emissions tests.<br></p> <p> Florent Grelier, a clean vehicles engineer at the Transport and Environment (T&amp;E) campaign group, told the Guardian he feared that EU attempts to improve air quality were being \u201cbent to the will of the automotive industry\u201d. </p> <p> \u201cThis is a petrolgate scandal in the making,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the European commission and governments establish strict test procedures to protect the industry from its own short-sightedness, within a few years we will see continuing high levels of particles killing hundreds of thousands of citizens prematurely.\u201d</p> <p> Under EU law, car-manufacturers are already obliged to use filters for diesel engines, but not for the rapidly-growing 40% of the petrol engine market which is made up by uncontrolled gasoline direct injection engines. These release more particulate matter than modern diesel cars.</p> <p> Gasoline particulate filters could reduce these emissions by a factor of around 100, and would cost manufacturers just \u20ac25 per car, according to research by T&amp;E. But car manufacturers have argued this would violate the principle of technology neutrality.</p> <p> A spokesman for Acea declined to comment on the issue.</p> <p>Calls by the auto industry for a delay in implementing the new regulation have been well received by several car-producing EU countries. Spain and Sweden argued for a one-year legislative delay that would push its introduction back to 2019, in minutes of a technical committee meeting earlier this month seen by the Guardian.</p> <p> The UK took no formal position on when the new regulation should enter into force but warned of \u201cunintended adverse effects\u201d if PM limits were given a separate starting date to standards for another pollutant, nitriogen oxide (NOx) , which will now begin in 2019.</p> <p> An EU group of national experts \u2013 the technical committee on motor vehicles - is now expected to sign off on the final proposal to amend the Euro 6 regulation for real world driving emissions, in December.</p> <p> The issue of \u201cconformity factors\u201d - or compensating for uncertainties in emissions tests \u2013 last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/28/eu-emissions-limits-nox-car-manufacturers\">led the committee to impose a NOx limit 110% higher</a> than the one written into the Euro 6 regulations last year.</p> <p>  </p>",
