  "<p>David Cameron was unequivocal. \u201cThe military,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military is definitely one sector where I don\u2019t see black people represented at the top.\u201d That was four years ago, and the former prime minister was talking to me about the sectors of society in which he felt people of African or African Caribbean heritage were most conspicuous by their absence.</p> <p>He had been spot-on in identifying the military; there are very few black faces in the senior ranks. Only 2.4% of officers are from a black or minority ethnic background \u2013 and that figure includes recruits from Commonwealth countries. However, he could just as easily have been talking about the civil service, the police or the media and still have been on the money.</p> <p>Six years before that conversation, I launched the <a href=\"http://www.powerlist.co.uk\">Powerlist</a>, an annual publication that profiles some of Britain\u2019s most influential people of African and African Caribbean heritage. Now, 10 years on, as we publish this year\u2019s list, we have found that despite some cause for optimism \u2013 mostly in the business sector \u2013 in many areas the situation is no better than a decade ago, and sometimes worse.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the government. Incredibly, there has never been an MP of African or African Caribbean heritage in the cabinet. The only black cabinet minister was Baroness Amos (a peer) who served in the decision-making body of the executive as secretary of state for international development and leader of the House of Lords between 2003 and 2007. Baroness Scotland, as attorney general, and before her Lord Boateng, as chief secretary to the Treasury, held positions in which the incumbent minister was regularly invited to attend cabinet meetings, but strictly speaking neither of those roles is regarded as being in the cabinet. Today there are no black people in the cabinet.</p> <p>A look at the judiciary shows that 10 years ago Dame Linda Dobbs, who currently chairs the Powerlist judging committee, was the only black high court judge. In 2004, when she was first appointed, she said of the fact that she was the first person of African heritage to fill such a role: \u201cI am confident that I am the first of many to come.\u201d Sadly, that has not been the case. Not only was she the one black high court judge throughout her tenure, but since Dobbs retired in 2013 there has been a total absence of black judges in the high court.</p> <p>Intriguingly, however, there has been a significant shift in representation on the list from the public to the private sector. There are no official data to back this up, but a look at corporate Britain reveals that the number of black people in senior positions has increased over the years \u2013 almost certainly as a result of aggressive diversity programmes instituted by many companies in this sector. In professional services, while the numbers are still far fewer than they ought to be, there are more black partners than ever before. It\u2019s the same in law firms: more black partners have come through over the past decade. And in banking, particularly investment banking, there are more black managing directors than ever.</p> <p>But when we look at board representation in FTSE 100 companies \u2013 the people who make the most important decisions in these firms \u2013 the picture once again turns ugly. There are just two UK-based black people \u2013 Dambisa Moyo, at Barclays and at SAB Miller, and Jean Tomlin at Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 serving on the board of a FTSE 100 firm. Both are non-executives. There are no black c-suite execs (chair, chief executive, chief finance officer etc) \u2013 the people who really run the company. In 2007 there were three, two of whom were executive directors.</p> <p>As our list has clearly shown over the years, this is not due to a paucity of talent. It\u2019s more to do with a lack of opportunities for that talent to shine, with some of the headhunters who have traditionally filled board vacancies particularly culpable because they simply don\u2019t know any black people.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not all bad news. The one area that seems to have thrived, somewhat ironically given the economic climate of the past decade, is the number of black-owned and run businesses that have come through.</p> <p>Ten years ago we struggled to find successful entrepreneurs. Now young people such as 24-year-old Steven Bartlett, who set up Social Chain, one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing social media firms, and former banker Martin Ijaha, the founder and CEO of Neyber, a company that offers affordable loans to company employees, are becoming serious trailblazers in the business sector. And then we have the more established entrepreneurs such as Ric Lewis, whose property investment firm Tristan Capital Partners has \u00a310bn under management, and Tom Ilube, who has set up and sold a number of tech companies. In the arts, Femi Oguns\u2019 Identity Agency Group has been at the forefront of supplying black British acting talent to Hollywood, <em>Star Wars</em> actor John Boyega being one high-profile success.</p> <p>On Tuesday we celebrate the Powerlist\u2019s 10th anniversary at the annual influencers\u2019 dinner, a black-tie event in the City which will feature leading figures in the UK\u2019s African and African Caribbean population as well as guests from the US, Africa and the Caribbean. London mayor Sadiq Khan, will deliver the keynote speech. It has become the most prestigious event in the black British calendar.</p> <p>Ten years on, Powerful Media, the company that publishes the list, has added <a href=\"http://powerful-media.com\">Future Leaders</a>, which profiles 100 of the UK\u2019s most talented black students every year and which has become an invaluable resource for our recruitment firm Powerful Personnel. Through it we work with some of the country\u2019s leading firms to assist them in their efforts to recruit the brightest and best, at all grades of seniority, regardless of their ethnicity.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always said that we will stop publishing the Powerlist when it is no longer necessary. But given the slow rate of change in so many areas of British life, it\u2019s arguably needed more now than ever before.</p> <h2>Corporates, financiers and entrepreneurs</h2> <p><strong>Nathaniel

  "<p>Italian police are investigating a dozen doctors at a Sicilian hospital after the family of a 32-year-old woman who died after a miscarriage claimed she was not given adequate medical attention. The family says that her doctor had professed moral objections to abortion.</p> <p>The death of Valentina Milluzzo, who was five months pregnant with twins when she miscarried and fell ill, has reignited a debate across Italy about the high number of gynaecologists and obstetricians who refuse to provide abortions. As a result, women may not get the medical attention they require in emergency situations.</p> <p>The investigation into the Cannizzaro obstetrics and gynaecology hospital in Catania on the east coast of Sicily was opened after the family of Milluzzo, who became pregnant through in-vitro fertilisation, said a doctor refused to intervene even though her life was at risk.</p> <p>Milluzzo had been admitted to the hospital two weeks earlier, after going into premature labour. After the death of one of the foetuses, Milluzzo reportedly became very ill and her blood pressure dropped rapidly. Her family asked for the other foetus to be aborted but say her doctor refused. Milluzzo died within hours on 16 October of septic shock.</p> <p>Milluzzo\u2019s partner, Francesco Castro, told reporters that his wife was \u201cscreaming in pain for nearly 12 hours\u201d when he asked the doctor to intervene. Milluzzo had already given birth to one foetus, which was stillborn, but Castro said the doctor told him he could \u201cnot intervene\u201d because he objected to abortion and the other foetus still had a viable heartbeat.</p> <p>Milluzzo\u2019s parents have backed her husband\u2019s recollection of events but the hospital has disputed the account, saying that an abortion would not have been necessary in Milluzzo\u2019s case because she was already miscarrying.</p> <p>Paolo Scolio, a doctor at the Cannizzaro, admitted that all of the doctors in the hospital were conscientious objectors to abortion but that other specialists could technically have been called in if required.</p> <p>Catania\u2019s prosecutor is now investigating a dozen doctors, which could lead to charges of manslaughter, according to Italian press reports.</p> <p>Beatrice Lorenzin, the Italian health minister, said doctors were permitted to conscientiously object to performing voluntary abortions on patients, but that doctors were not allowed by law to withhold medical treatment when women\u2019s lives were at risk. This point was reiterated by a national association of Catholic doctors, who said they had to do whatever was necessary to save a woman\u2019s life it if was in danger.</p> <p>Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, but the rules surrounding the medical procedure are stringent. Under Italian law, doctors can perform an abortion during the first 90 days of pregnancy. But after that a woman must either be physically or mentally at risk because of the pregnancy or have evidence of a serious problem with the foetus.</p> <p>The most recent government figures show that about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages\" title=\"\">seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists </a>refuse to carry out abortions on the grounds of conscientious objection. The proportion of doctors who object has risen from about 59% in 2005 to 70% in 2013.</p> <p>The health ministry had previously denied that the increasing number of doctors in Italy who were refusing to perform abortions posed any risk to women, because the number of abortions was decreasing.</p> <p>When the health ministry was asked earlier this year whether Italy could ensure that women had access to safe abortions given the high rate of objectors, the ministry said that the workload of doctors who did perform abortions was sustainable.</p> <p>The number of doctors who object differs from region to region, but Sicily is among the areas with the highest number of doctors who will not carry out abortions, with a rate of about 87.6% of gynaecologists in the region refusing to perform the procedure.</p> <p>The International Planned Parenthood Federation, a global group that supports abortion rights, said the case had eerie echoes of the death in 2012 in Ireland of 31-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/14/ireland-woman-dies-after-abortion-refusal\" title=\"\">Savita Halappanavar</a>, who was admitted to Galway University clinic with severe abdominal pain and high fever but was denied an abortion. She died of septicaemia.</p> <p>\u201cItaly is not Ireland and abortion has been legal in Italy for 40 years,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe tragic death of Valentina highlights the brutality of a system that permits objecting health care providers to disrespect the law.</p> <p>\u201cFar too many doctors and medical staff put their personal conscience before a woman\u2019s conscience, life and dignity.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/15/social-care-elderly-inadequate-funding\" title=\"\">view on social care</a> (Editorial) rightly highlights a vital public service on its knees following years of funding cuts. This neglect of our social-care system is having a dire effect on the lives of thousands, if not millions, of disabled and older people who deserve decent, dignified and compassionate support to live fulfilling and independent lives.</p> <p>We know that funding cuts mean at least 400,000 fewer people are now receiving social care compared to 2009. In addition to the devastating impact on individuals, this is placing the NHS under further unsustainable pressure.</p> <p>The government must take urgent action on this issue. With the autumn statement fast approaching, the chancellor has an opportunity to bring forward vital additional funding to help stabilise a system facing crisis.</p> <p>In the longer term, we need an honest national conversation, led by a cross-party commission, about which aspects of support the state can and should fund and what people should be individually responsible for. Only then will we create a social-care system that is sustainable and of which we can all be proud.<br><strong>Neil Heslop</strong><br>Chief executive<br>Leonard Cheshire Disability, London SW8</p> <h2><strong>The will of the people?</strong><br></h2> <p>The hypocrisy of Brexit politicians never ceases to amaze. As you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/new-alliances-oppose-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">reported</a> (In Focus), at Westminster they demand that parliament, in which they have no majority, should not have a voice in the Leave negotiations. They argue that Brexit is the inviolable will of the people, despite being that of less than half of the electorate and only a small majority of those who actually voted. The reverse is the case in Northern Ireland. There, they have used the built-in Unionist majority in Stormont to thwart the democratically expressed wish of their electorate to remain, which could be recognised by negotiating special EU status for Northern Ireland.

If we are serious about trying to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we cannot afford more air travel. Therefore, a much better option than increasing supply is to reduce demand, by raising airport duty. A sharp increase in the tax would greatly reduce the number of flights taken for trivial purposes, leaving plenty of air travel capacity for the business users who are lobbying for expansion.</p> <p>The money raised from the more expensive flights would ideally be used to cancel some of the austerity public spending cuts, but if the government wanted a more populist approach, they could share it out as a direct payment to every adult in the UK as an annual \u201cclimate change bonus\u201d.<br><strong>Richard Mountford</strong><br>Tonbridge, Kent</p> <h2><strong>Hooray for the tax activists</strong><br></h2> <p>Luke Harding charts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/taxes-panama-papers-trump-tax-havens\" title=\"\">the gradual exposure of tax havens</a> and their users (\u201cOnly idiots still pay tax\u201d, News) but predictably forgets to mention one group.

  "<p>Two decades ago, the Democratic Republic of Congo, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest country, was engulfed in what became known as <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/1213296\" title=\"\">Africa\u2019s Great War</a>, a conflict that drew in half-a-dozen neighbouring countries and raged for five years from 1998.</p> <p>The conflict and its aftermath cost the lives of an estimated 5.4&#xa0;million people, mainly from starvation and disease. This epic disaster was largely ignored outside Africa, even though it was the developed world\u2019s insatiable demand for the DRC\u2019s mineral riches that helped to fuel it.</p> <p>The war was halted, in part, by the introduction of a new constitution and a democratic system of governance, replacing decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/mobutu-sese-seko-remains-repatriated-congo-zaire\" title=\"\">Mobutu Sese Seko\u2019s brutal dictatorship</a>. In 2006 Joseph Kabila was confirmed as DRC president by popular vote, although the fairness of the election was widely disputed. In 2011 he was re-elected. Again, the results were hotly contested. A key factor in their acceptance was his pledge to honour the constitution and refrain from seeking a third term.</p> <p>The DRC\u2019s next presidential election is due next month. It isn\u2019t going to happen. A court last week upheld a request by the election commission that the poll be postponed, ostensibly because voter rolls are incomplete. A \u201cnational dialogue\u201d by the ruling coalition and involving fringe parties and civic groups, but boycotted by the main opposition and Catholic church, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/drc-elections-put-back-to-2018-as-opposition-calls-strike-in-protest\" title=\"\">also agreed a delay until at least April 2018</a>. In effect, Kabila and his security force backers have compromised the constitution and the judiciary and engineered a silent coup. His solemn 2011 promise has been broken.</p> <p>This shameless subversion of the democratic process (parliamentary and provincial polls have also been put off) was condemned by the main opposition party, the UDPS, as a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d. Rassemblement (Gathering), the multi-party opposition organisation, reacted with fury and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/general-strike-kinshasa-drc-congo-kabila-election-postponement-president\" title=\"\">called a general strike</a> last Wednesday. Kabila\u2019s attempt to cling to power threatens the DRC\u2019s hard-won and still precarious stability. Worse, it risks a return to national and regional upheaval, violence and war. At least this time the world is paying more attention. Maman Sambo Sidikou, the senior UN official in the country,<a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/un-warns-of-large-scale-violence-in-congo-crisis/a-36019244\" title=\"\"> warned the UN security council</a> last week that \u201clarge-scale violence is all but inevitable\u201d if the impasse is not resolved. \u201cThe tipping point could be reached very quickly.\u201d After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/democratic-republic-congo-demonstrations-banned-police-killed-joseph-kabila-etienne-tshisekedi\" title=\"\">related clashes in Kinshasa last month,</a> in which at least 50 people died, the US imposed limited sanctions on army generals implicated in human rights abuses. On Monday EU foreign ministers also agreed to pursue possible punitive measures.</p> <p>Matters are not as clear cut as they might seem. Kabila denies he wanted the delay. Analysts suggest the president, thrust into office after his father was assassinated in 2001, is a frontman for the security apparatus. The opposition is fragmented and its readiness to resort to protests often leads to violence. Concerns over stability by <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/france-moots-drc-sanctions-with-elections-delayed/a-35958088\" title=\"\">countries such as France</a> and Belgium are not wholly disinterested, commercially speaking. But that the leadership of another African country appears ready to ride roughshod over democracy and laws is clear. The DRC has never had a peaceful transition of power since independence in 1960. This is why term limits are so important. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/burundi/11614000/African-presidents-dilemma-Should-I-stay-or-should-I-go.html\" title=\"\">presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and Congo-Brazzaville</a> overrode constitutional requirements that they step aside. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/14/fake-calm-in-burundi-as-tension-threatens-return-to-violence\" title=\"\">In Burundi\u2019s case</a>, violence and displacement resulted. In Uganda, Yoweri Museveni looks determined to go on for ever. Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwean \u201cpresidency for life\u201d and Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos\u2019s Angolan ascendancy provide further examples of endemic disregard for democratic principles.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to think Africans care less about self-serving, corrupt and irresponsible politicians than Europeans or Americans. The African Union has repeatedly stressed peaceful political transitions in embedding democratic habits. Studies show African voters <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/africa/how-to-deepen-transition-to-democratic-governance-in-central-africa.cfm\" title=\"\">value democratic systems</a> but are increasingly frustrated at their malfunctioning and wilful subversion.</p> <p>Nigeria demonstrated last year<a href=\"http://blog.crisisgroup.org/africa/nigeria/2015/04/02/nigerias-unexpected-election-success/\" title=\"\"> how it could be done</a>. But South Africa, ruled since apartheid\u2019s end by a single, overpowerful party, is less of a shining light. Its reported decision to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/south-africa-to-quit-international-criminal-court-document-shows\" title=\"\"> renounce the International Criminal Court</a> is another sign that too many African politicians would rather jettison democratic and legal norms than subject themselves to scrutiny and public judgment.</p>",
  "<p>Several of London\u2019s largest banks are looking to stockpile bitcoins in order to pay off cyber criminals who threaten to bring down their critical IT systems.</p> <p>The virtual currency, which is highly prized by criminal networks because it is difficult to trace, is being acquired by blue chip companies in order to pay ransoms, according to a leading IT expert.</p> <p>On Friday, hackers attacked the websites of a number of leading online companies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/ddos-attack-dyn-internet-denial-service\">Twitter, Spotify and Reddit</a>. They used a special code to harness the power of hundreds of thousands of internet-connected home devices, such as CCTV cameras and printers, to launch \u201cdistributed denial of service\u201d (DDoS) attacks through a US company called Dyn, which provides directory services to online companies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/brian-krebs-ddos-attack-google-protection-cybercrime\">DDoS attacks</a> involve inundating computer servers with so much data traffic that they cannot cope.</p> <p>There is no evidence that Dyn was the subject of extortion demands but it has become apparent that hackers have been using the code to threaten other businesses into paying them with bitcoins or risk becoming the target of similar attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cd52ecc3c4c5fe1d5d25aad52c0ecd0d71a7c96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cd52ecc3c4c5fe1d5d25aad52c0ecd0d71a7c96/0_38_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter was among a those giant internet companies targeted by last week\u2019s attack in the United States\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter was among a those giant internet companies targeted by last week\u2019s attack in the United States</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Simon Moores, a former technology ambassador for the UK government and chair of the annual international e-Crime Congress, the global body that brings together IT professionals, said the scale and ferocity of the attacks meant some banks were coming round to the view that it was cheaper to pay off the criminals than risk an attack.</p> <p>\u201cThe police will concede that they don\u2019t have the resources available to deal with this because of the significant growth in the number of attacks,\u201d Moores said. \u201cFrom a purely pragmatic perspective, financial institutions are now exploring the need to maintain stocks of bitcoin in the unfortunate event that they themselves become the target of a high-intensity attack, when law enforcement perhaps might not be able to assist them at the speed with which they need to put themselves back in business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/intel-better-it-decisions/2016/sep/30/how-safe-are-you-from-hackers\">How safe are you from hackers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moores declined to identify the banks buying up bitcoins but it is understood senior police officers have been made aware of the practice.

Initial reports put it at approximately 665 gigabits of traffic a second, far more than is typically needed to knock most sites offline.</p> <p>Some experts believe the attacks were launched in response to articles that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/23/brians-krebs-ddos-attack/\">Krebs</a> had published about the DDoS-for-hire service vDOS, which coincided with the arrests of two young men identified as its founders.</p> <p>The attack on Krebs was launched by a large botnet, a collection of enslaved computers \u2013 in this case, hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/oct/22/how-did-hackers-use-everyday-devices-to-launch-a-cyber-attack-video-report\">hacked devices</a> that constitute the internet of things (IoT), notably routers, IP cameras and digital video recorders. These devices are the internet\u2019s achilles heel. Unlike personal computers or smartphones, they are often not password protected, relying on factory settings. Because of this they make soft targets for <a href=\"https://digitalguardian.com/blog/attack-killer-cameras\">botnets</a> scanning the internet for IoT systems that can be easily compromised.</p> <p>The Krebs attack might have gone largely unnoticed outside of internet security circles if someone using the name Anna-senpai had not then chosen to release the source code that powered the botnet on to a hackers\u2019 forum.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first go in DDoS industry, I wasn\u2019t planning on staying in it long,\u201d Anna-senpai said on the Hack Forums site. \u201cI made my money, there\u2019s lots of eyes looking at IoT now, so it\u2019s time to GTFO.\u201d</p> <p>Within hours of Anna-senpai\u2019s decision to release the botnet into the wild, it was creating havoc as others started to employ the code to enslave more devices. Soon an army of zombified devices was mobilising against Dyn.</p> <p>By targeting Dyn, it appears that hackers were able temporarily to disrupt a raft of sites. Others that reported problems included Mashable, CNN, the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and Yelp.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s web services division reported issues in western Europe. In the UK, Twitter and several news sites could not be accessed by some users.</p> <p>Anna-senpai\u2019s identity and motivation for releasing the code remains a mystery.

China, Russia and North Korea have all been mentioned in IT circles.</p> <p>\u201cWhile this particular attack [on Dyn] may not have been motivated by extortion, a new model of ransom-based attacks could be on the horizon, motivated to pay off threats for fear of infrastructure-wide customer outages,\u201d said Thomas Pore, director of IT at Plixer, a malware incident response company. \u201cAn infrastructure outage, such as DNS [denial of service], against a service provider impacting both the provider and customers may prompt a quick ransom payoff to avoid unwanted customer attrition or larger financial impact.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5c4585e361e9e6101263278d9e63803edad9caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5c4585e361e9e6101263278d9e63803edad9caa/0_128_4906_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The headquarters in New Hampshire of US internet service company Dyn, which was targeted by hackers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The headquarters in New Hampshire of US internet service company Dyn, which was targeted by hackers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Cole/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem facing businesses battling the hackers is becoming one of scale.

But if they choose not to there is one other very good team in Manchester that is hoovering up the talent.\u201d</p> <p>Glenn welcomed the global FA Cup deal. \u201cWe went in with a big ambition, saying 4.5 billion people watch the Premier League around the world and the FA Cup is typically, by the later stages, Premier League clubs playing each other in a pretty intense format.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s biggest banks are preparing to relocate out of the UK in the first few months of 2017 amid growing fears over the impending Brexit negotiations, while smaller banks are making plans to get out before Christmas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/oct/21/hard-brexit-risk-expertise-skills-research\">Hard Brexit would put UK's skills and expertise advantage at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dramatic claim is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/22/brexit-threat-to-british-banks\">made in the <em>Observer</em></a> by the chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.bba.org.uk/\">British Bankers\u2019 Association</a>, Anthony Browne, who warns \u201cthe public and political debate at the moment is taking us in the wrong direction\u201d.</p> <p>A source close to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said he and the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, had last week sought to offer reassurance that they were determined to secure the status of the City of London.</p> <p>However, the government\u2019s stated intention to take control of the freedom of movement into the UK is widely recognised among officials to be a hammer blow to any chance of retaining the present terms of trade for banks, particularly given the bellicose rhetoric of major politicians on the continent.</p> <p>The so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/passporting-rights-brexit-uk-firms-fca-eu\">passporting rights</a> for members of the single market allow UK-based banks to offer financial services to companies and individuals across the EU unimpeded, yet the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is among those who have insisted in recent weeks that hard Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/uk-will-get-a-hard-brexit-if-may-pursues-tough-approach-hollande\">will mean \u201chard negotiation\u201d</a> and Britain will need to \u201cpay the price\u201d of leaving.</p> <p>A hard Brexit would involve the UK leaving both the single market, a central pillar of which is freedom of movement, and the customs union, which could potentially reintroduce tariff and non-tariff restrictions on British imports and exports.</p> <p>Browne warns that British and European politicians who appear to be pursuing \u201canti-trade\u201d goals need to recognise that \u201cputting up barriers to the trade in financial services across the Channel will make us all worse off\u201d.</p> <p>Browne, whose organisation has been in intense negotiations with the government, further warns the EU that banks based in the UK are currently lending \u00a31.1tn, therefore \u201ckeeping the continent afloat financially\u201d, and this arrangement is at risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cf8532b5647e3e03e74db5208bb6ce42f881a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf8532b5647e3e03e74db5208bb6ce42f881a76/186_272_3552_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Browne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Browne of the British Bankers\u2019 Association says the whole of Europe will suffer if the UK chooses a hard Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of Britain\u2019s position, he writes that banking is the country\u2019s biggest export industry by far and the current trajectory threatens not just tariff-free trade, but the legal right of banks to provide services.</p> <p>\u201cMost international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers, the date by which this must happen, and how best to do it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cTheir hands are quivering over the relocate button. Many smaller banks plan to start relocations before Christmas; bigger banks are expected to start in the first quarter of next year.\u201d</p> <p>Sources close to Davis dismissed speculation that he believed a solution would be for the City to strike an \u201cequivalence\u201d deal with the EU, under which the regulatory systems are recognised by both parties through a one-off agreement. Browne writes that some Brexiters have made such an argument, but such a deal would not be enough to stop banks deserting Britain.</p> <p>\u201cOn this side of the Channel, some high-profile Brexiters have poured scorn on the idea that we need passporting at all and that other regimes such as \u2018third country equivalence\u2019 will do,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut the EU\u2019s equivalence regime is a poor shadow of passporting \u2013 it only covers a narrow range of services, can be withdrawn at virtually no notice, and will probably mean the UK will have to accept rules it has no influence over. For most banks, equivalence won\u2019t prevent them from relocating their operations.\u201d</p> <p>It has been reported that Goldman Sachs is among those drawing up plans to transfer around 2,000 of its employees to a rival European city, should the UK lose its passporting rights.</p> <p>The industry body <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.thecityuk.com/\">TheCityUk</a> has claimed that up to 70,000 financial jobs could be lost if Britain leaves the EU without a new, credible relationship in place for the City of London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/european-banks-warn-off-political-intrusion\">European banks warn against political 'intrusion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Browne says he understands the motivation of those who are seeking to take business from UK shores, but he condemns politicians who appear to be willing to break up the integrated financial market, which \u201cmakes it easier and cheaper for French farmers, German manufacturers and Italian fashion designers to secure funding\u201d.</p> <p>He writes: \u201cIt is understandable that other European cities want to attract jobs from London. Delegations from Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Madrid are all coming to the UK to pitch to bankers. I am pro-competition, and long may they try to make their labour market and fiscal policy more attractive to international investors.</p> <p>\u201cThat is not the problem. The problem comes when national governments try to use the EU exit negotiations to build walls across the Channel to split Europe\u2019s integrated financial market in two, in order to force jobs from London.\u201d</p> <p>The scale of the task facing the UK in striking a good Brexit deal with the EU has been put in stark relief by the apparent collapse of the proposed EU-Canada trade pact.</p> <p>On Saturday, there were frantic diplomatic efforts to salvage a deal after Canada\u2019s international trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/21/chrystia-freeland-frustrated-failure-eu-canada-trade-deal-video\">walked out of talks</a>. She described the situation as \u201cimpossible\u201d on Friday and cast doubt on the bloc\u2019s ability to operate effectively after the proposals were blocked by a regional administration in Belgium.</p> <p>The parliament in Wallonia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/eu-canada-free-trade-deal-delayed-belgium-ceta\">holding up the deal</a>, although the region\u2019s leader, Paul Magnette, suggested the standoff could be resolved within days. It has concerns the deal will undermine labour, environment and consumer standards, and allow multinationals to crush local firms.</p>",
  "<p>The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is poised to name a \u201cnight tsar\u201d after a spate of closures of clubs and other late-night venues that has prompted alarm about the city\u2019s future as a 24-hour city.</p> <p>The identity of the tsar will be made public next month, and a report by the mayor-appointed \u201cnight time commission\u201d published by the end of the year. The commission will propose steps to promote the night-time economy as \u201ca key driver of economic and cultural regeneration, and a magnet for domestic and international visitors\u201d.</p> <p>According to a recent <a href=\"http://londonfirst.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Londons-24-hour-economy.pdf\">study by London First</a>, the capital\u2019s night-time businesses contributed up to \u00a326.3bn to the UK economy in 2014, forecast to rise by \u00a32bn by 2029. But behind the upbeat tone of the report, club and bar owners are voicing growing concern about their businesses, which they say are being threatened by bureaucracy and the pace and scale of development in London.</p> <p>In the past five years, London has lost half its nightclubs and more than 40% of its music venues. Last month, one of the country\u2019s best-known nightclubs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/london-nightclub-fabric-close-permanently-licence-revoked-drugs\">Fabric, lost its licence</a> after two drug-related deaths. The closure was \u201ca miserable day for London\u2019s clubbing landscape\u201d, according to the Ministry of Sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b93e640241991edebfa446441e9a2a28cffe3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22b93e640241991edebfa446441e9a2a28cffe3d/0_0_4500_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man reads placards left on the doors of the Fabric night club.

The Coronet in south London recently won a year\u2019s reprieve but is expected to close in January 2018 as part of a shopping centre redevelopment.</p> <p>Club owners and advocates of London\u2019s night-time economy blame restrictive licensing laws, aggressive property development and growing complaints from new residents.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating about the UK is that we don\u2019t actually see that the night-time economy helps make places more attractive to a highly educated, very mobile, creative workforce that creates a huge number of new jobs and businesses wherever they choose to go,\u201d said Rohan Silva, the founder of start-up workspace and cultural centre <a href=\"https://secondhome.io/\">Second Home</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBritish policy makers don\u2019t understand the relationship between the night-time economy and our cities being places that talented people want to live and work in.\u201d</p> <p>London\u2019s mayor and his new night tsar will address these issues, says City Hall. Better protection for music venues and nightclubs will be put in place and the mayor will work with developers to find new sites. A new \u201cagent of change\u201d principle means that the onus will be on developers to take steps such as soundproofing new residential properties in areas where music venues or nightclubs are already established. Likewise, if a nightclub opens in a residential area, it will be responsible for safeguarding residents\u2019 peace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"733d47f697aa86eec6611345b8a226b4715ddfbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/733d47f697aa86eec6611345b8a226b4715ddfbf/0_115_4990_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadiq Khan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has appointed a \u2018night time commission\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, Zurich and Toulouse already have \u201cnight mayors\u201d but, said Marion Roberts, professor of urban design at the University of Westminster, \u201cyou have to be very careful about making comparisons between London and other European cities\u201d. London\u2019s population is almost three times that of Berlin and four times that of Paris, she pointed out. \u201cNew York or Tokyo are more accurate comparators.\u201d</p> <p>Roberts hopes the night tsar will encourage new kinds of night-time activity in London, such as markets, gallery openings, film clubs and classical music concerts, as well as clubs. Londoners want relaxed, quirky and experimental offerings, she said.</p> <p>According to Silva, \u201cit\u2019s striking how few things there are to do at 1am or 2am. We\u2019re nothing like a 24-hour city.\u201d He opened his bookshop <a href=\"http://libreria.io/\">Libreria</a> through the night to mark the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/night-tube-thunders-into-london-stations\">start of the night tube</a> in August and was astonished when thousands of people flocked there.</p> <p>He also cited the popularity of the <a href=\"http://www.institut-francais.org.uk/mynightwithphilosophers/\">Institut Francais\u2019 all-night philosophy sessions</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.shufflefestival.com/festival/\">Shuffle festival</a> in Mile End, \u201cwhere there was poetry at 3am and science workshops at 4am, and it was packed all night\u201d.</p> <p>Changes in working patterns were fuelling demand for more flexibility in people\u2019s lives, he said. \u201cBy the end of 2018, we\u2019re expecting there to be more freelancers and self-employed than there are people working in the public sector.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been profound shifts in the way we work, freeing people from the tyranny of nine to five. It\u2019s creating more expectation that cities like London should cater for different lifestyles.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/05/fabric-licence-appeal-november-closure\">appeal against Fabric\u2019s loss of licence</a> will be heard next month, and many clubbers, club owners and champions of the night-time economy will be watching closely. \u201cIt will be a signal,\u201d said Silva. \u201cLondon is facing a big test of its resolve post-Brexit to be attractive to global people who can choose to be anywhere they want to be. We need all the positive messages we can muster.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Deeper and deeper Sunderland dropped, until they were almost defending from their six-yard box, and there was an inevitability about the cruel blow that came from Winston Reid\u2019s left foot in the fourth minute of stoppage time. Having decided to settle for a point when a braver side might have sought to test West Ham United\u2019s nerve in a stadium that still feels a little cold and alien, they ended up with nothing. Their air of resignation about their plight is becoming suffocating, a self-fulfilling prophesy that threatens to drag them into the Championship without so much as a whimper.</p> <p>As the cliche goes, goals change games and Reid\u2019s winner certainly altered the perception of a desperately poor game. If Sunderland had held out, David Moyes would have been able to praise their resilience or Lamine Kon\u00e9\u2019s fine performance in central defence. In that parallel universe, the visitors left east London with their heads held high, determined to build on a morale-boosting draw by giving Arsenal the game of their lives at the Stadium of Light next Saturday.</p> <p>Instead they departed stalked by the stench of doom and decay, the focus switching to a debate about whether they were punished for their negativity, with Moyes handing the initiative to West Ham by replacing two of his attacking players with defenders in the final&#xa0;10&#xa0;minutes. Slaven Bilic added another striker, Ashley Fletcher, to West Ham\u2019s attack.</p> <p>In trying to hold what they had, it was no surprise that the league\u2019s bottom side proved so butterfingered. Although the pressure from West Ham could hardly be called relentless \u2013 for much of the second half the hosts attacked with all the sense of direction of a fly repeatedly zooming into a window \u2013 Reid\u2019s goal leaves Sunderland with two points from their first nine matches, winless and witless.</p> <p>Moyes complained that Jonathan Calleri was standing in an offside position when the substitute let Reid\u2019s shot run through his legs and past Jordan Pickford, but the flag stayed down.</p> <p>From West Ham\u2019s perspective, this was a crucial victory after last Saturday\u2019s restorative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/15/crystal-palace-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">win over Crystal Palace</a>. It lifted them three points clear of the bottom three and eased the pressure on Bilic, although he knew that his team failed to impress once again in the disorienting environment of their new ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Clinical Burnley edge out Everton with Scott Arfield\u2019s last-minute winner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They faded after starting brightly and there were plenty of moments when Sunderland wasted chances to expose their defensive flaws on the break.</p> <p>In West Ham\u2019s defence, they played some excellent football in the opening 20 minutes when Sunderland had the look of a side waiting for the punishment to begin. Bilic kept faith with the 3-4-2-1 system that worked so well at Selhurst Park with Edimilson Fernandes, a young Swiss midfielder, making his first league start in place of the suspended Aaron Cresswell on the left and Dimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini kept popping up in dangerous positions. \u201cWe were really good,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cJust we didn\u2019t score a goal.\u201d</p> <p>Payet threatened on three occasions, curling wide after a neat exchange with Mark Noble, shooting too close to Pickford at the end of a brilliant dribble through the heart of the defence and hitting the base of the right post with an effort from 18 yards out.</p> <p>An early goal would have extinguished the uncertainty that weighs West Ham down here, but their dip in intensity let Sunderland into the game. \u201cWe are still in a bit of cramp,\u201d Bilic said, pointing to his head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/leicester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester back on track as Shinji Okazaki shines in win over Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Far too isolated throughout the first half, Jermain Defoe perked up. Jack Rodwell sent a header narrowly over and Wahbi Khazri squandered Sunderland\u2019s best opening at the start of the second half, shooting insipidly at Adri\u00e1n.</p> <p>\u201cI did not enjoy the first part, but the second half we were not threatened and, if anything, we looked more likely to score,\u201d Moyes said.</p> <p>Yet Sunderland invited late pressure when Moyes brought on Paddy McNair and Billy Jones for Duncan Watmore and Khazri respectively, ceding territory and paying for it when a short corner routine ended with Payet finding Reid, who turned and hammered a low shot through the bodies from 18 yards out. Sunderland slumped again.</p>",
  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up \u00a352bn of losses since it was bailed out eight years ago this month: and when it reports third-quarter results on Friday it is expected to dive even deeper into the red.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s list of woes seem neverending, ranging from a potential \u00a39bn penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling mortgage bonds a decade ago to allegations of bad treatment of small business customers. Its share price is so far below the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/philip-hammond-drops-plan-to-sell-cut-price-lloyds-shares-to-public\" title=\"\">the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has abandoned any attempts to sell off any more shares</a>.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s troubles have prompted one thinktank to argue that it is time for a radical strategy rethink, after the bank scaled itself down from a global business with operations in more than 50 countries to one with a flag in just 13 and a renewed focus on the UK high street.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the UK government to put all options for the bank\u2019s future back on the table and urgently examine whether there are alternatives that could deliver better value for taxpayers and the economy,\u201d Laurie Macfarlane, an economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF), <a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/taking-control-of-rbs/\" title=\"\">argues in a paper published this weekend</a>.</p> <p>The vote for Brexit has given the NEF fresh impetus in its call for RBS to be broken up into 130 regional UK banks. Macfarlane argues that RBS could turn its focus to \u201clending for investment in production services such as manufacturing, retailing and distribution, telecoms, construction and energy\u201d, which are spread across the UK.</p> <p>\u201cTurning it into a network of local banks could therefore help boost real-economy lending while investing in communities that have been left behind by our London-centric economic model \u2013 exactly the kinds of communities who voted to leave the EU,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It is not the first time that the NEF \u2013 among others \u2013 have called for a rethink of the strategy for RBS. Sir Vince Cable called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/04/vince-cable-rbs-break-up\" title=\"\">for the dismantling of the Edinburgh-based bank when he was the business secretary</a> in the coalition government. \u201cAt the very beginning of our government, we should have gone for the breakup option,\u201d the former Liberal Democrat MP says.</p> <p>\u201cThey should be trying to create sensible smaller banks out of the greater whole,\u201d Cable adds. However, he acknowledges he has been told that the cost of breakup would be too high \u2013 illustrated by the problems RBS has experienced in trying to spin off just 300&#xa0;branches, as stipulated by the EU as punishment for receiving state aid.</p> <p>The difficulty RBS has encountered in selling off these branches, intended to be rebranded Williams &amp; Glyn, was referred to by Hammond when he announced that ambitions to sell off the remaining 73% stake had been put on the back burner. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the disposal of RBS shares at a price that recovers taxpayers\u2019 investment is not practical at the moment,\u201d Hammond said. The shares closed on Friday at 190p.</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, had indicated that selling the government\u2019s stake at a profit was not a priority. He sold 5% at 330p a share \u2013 and a \u00a31bn loss \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\" title=\"\">in August 2015</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a958f0375c6429a40cd4cd8cd32880af06c9014\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a958f0375c6429a40cd4cd8cd32880af06c9014/0_37_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross McEwan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross McEwan, RBS\u2019s chief executive, would be unlikely to welcome a radical review of strategy for the bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Analysts hold out little expectation that the RBS share price will ever get back to 502p. According to Bloomberg, the average forecast by analysts is 180p a share \u2013 and thus, Macfarlane argues, it is time for a rethink: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that there is no way the taxpayer can make its money back by selling RBS back to the private sector.\u201d</p> <p>The Treasury, though, is unlikely to have much appetite to embark upon a strategy reversal. Osborne commissioned a review into whether RBS should be split up in 2013. It backed off radical action and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/royal-bank-scotland-losses-internal-bad-bank-rbs\" title=\"\">instead focused on putting \u00a338bn of troublesome assets into an internal bad bank</a>.</p> <p>Ross McEwan, now entering his fourth year as chief executive of RBS, would be unlikely to welcome a full-blown review either. He has embarked on an effort to put a fresh focus on NatWest \u2013 the now-revived brand name for RBS\u2019s high street banking business in England and Wales \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/royal-bank-scotland-turns-back-fred-goodwin-era-natwest-ads\" title=\"\">through a new advertising campaign</a> launched last month, and has turned the focus on the remaining businesses, which generate \u00a31bn of profit a quarter. His problem, though, is that those profits are being wiped out by tackling the so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d of the past.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, also points out that RBS is the fastest-growing among its UK peers in terms of lending for mortgages and business. \u201cBut that is being drowned out by the bigger, more volatile, \u2018known unknowns\u2019,\u201d says&#xa0;Gordon.</p> <h2>RBS\u2019s problems</h2> <p>\u25a0 A settlement, yet to be negotiated, with the US Department of Justice over the way <strong>mortgage bonds were packaged up a decade ago and sold on</strong> to consumers. RBS has not been able to estimate the financial impact of this settlement but analysts put figures on it ranging from \u00a34bn to \u00a39bn.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>The sale of 300 branches, to be branded Williams &amp; Glyn,</strong> stipulated by the EU as punishment for the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The bank admitted in August that there was no longer any prospect of spinning this business out onto the stock market and is looking for a trade buyer. However, the obvious bidder, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander, is said to have pulled out.</p> <p>\u25a0 A much-delayed<strong> report into the treatment of small business customers</strong>. The investigation, commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority, began after allegations first surfaced in 2013 that the bailed-out bank was deliberately wrecking small businesses to make profits.</p>",
  "<p>As a trial lawyer, Mark Baute takes pride in being able to \u201cbreak\u201d a witness within three minutes, even if it\u2019s a weeping young woman accusing three men of rape.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/19/derrick-rose-rape-trial-verdict-consent-nba-jury-photos\">NBA star Derrick Rose and friends cleared in rape case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The combative attorney did so while defending the NBA star Derrick Rose in a high-stakes trial in Los Angeles that ended this week in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/19/derrick-rose-rape-trial-verdict-consent-nba-jury-photos\">victory for his client</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you break a witness?\u201d Baute said in an interview on Friday, reflecting on his win. \u201cIt\u2019s preparation, understanding people, and eye contact. Some witnesses show up ready to lie and they need to be shown in the first three minutes that they\u2019ll be exposed.\u201d</p> <p>Some critics said the two-week civil trial exposed other things: ruthless \u201cslut shaming\u201d of the accuser; a jury in thrall to celebrity; a judicial system that intimidates alleged sex assault victims.</p> <p>Baute, 55, vehemently rejected all that. The 30-year-old accuser, he said, concocted a \u201cbullshit\u201d story that she told through tearful testimony to try to extort a fortune from the New York Knicks point guard.</p> <p>\u201cCrocodile tears. Pretty easy to fake if you\u2019re looking for 20m bucks. I had the same reaction as many jurors \u2013 the tears looked choreographed.\u201d</p> <p>In his closing argument to the jury Baute said the accuser, known as Jane Doe to shield her identity, had welcomed her alleged assailants into bed with \u201copen arms and open legs\u201d. That and other comments by the defense team, including a request to the judge to stop Doe sobbing on the stand, appalled some observers.</p> <p>But on Wednesday the jury of six women and two men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/19/derrick-rose-rape-trial-verdict-consent-nba-jury-photos\">cleared Rose and his co-defendants</a>, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, of all liabilities. Outside the federal court jury members smiled and <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/10/19/derrick-rose-juror-photos/#M3zDoYycTSqQ\">posed for pictures</a> with the athlete and Baute.</p> <p>\u201cThe system worked,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cWe picked the smartest jury we possibly could because we believed the plaintiff would act on the stand. Smart jurors can see past the tears.\u201d</p> <p>Doe\u2019s lawyers, in contrast, said that underhand tactics prevailed. They accused Baute\u2019s team of stripping her of her anonymity and smearing her by claiming she had no \u201clegitimate fear of shame\u201d because photos from her Instagram account were sexual in nature. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame for this country that a celebrity can come to court and slut-shame a woman,\u201d Waukeen McCoy, an attorney for Doe, told reporters after the verdict.</p> <p>Baute said using Doe\u2019s real identity was necessary for a fair, transparent trial but that her anonymity endured, with mainstream media still using the pseudonym. He denied slut-shaming or criticizing her choices on the disputed night. \u201cWe were respectful of her.\u201d</p> <p>The trial channeled issues of sex, consent, race and fame in the wake of outcries over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bill-cosby\">Bill Cosby</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, who are accused of getting away with sexual assault and misconduct, and Brock Turner, a former Stanford student, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/brock-turner-released-jail-sexual-assault-stanford\">served just three months</a> for a campus sexual assault.</p> <p>Baute bristled at any suggestion Rose, the youngest player to win the NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player award, belonged in that category. If there were victims, he said, it was Rose and his co-defendants, young black men targeted by a gold-digger and then traduced by biased media coverage.</p> <p>\u201cEvery member of our team picked up on the anti-black coverage. In cases of rape and black men the white media can no longer function in an objective way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41584d7aad49f7942f51a310623d5d377b54ca89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41584d7aad49f7942f51a310623d5d377b54ca89/0_173_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derrick Rose arrives at federal court in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derrick Rose arrives at federal court in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ut/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Doe and Rose had dated on and off for two years before the alleged assault. On the night of 26 August 2013 Doe and a female friend visited Rose\u2019s rented Beverly Hills home. Doe became inebriated and took a taxi back to her apartment. Hours later Rose, Hampton and Allen entered her apartment, took turns having sex with her and left. </p> <p>The case hinged on whether Doe was too incapacitated to give consent. In the absence of physical evidence \u2013 Doe waited two years to report the alleged assault \u2013 it boiled down to her word against the defendants\u2019 and interpretation of text messages she exchanged with Rose.</p> <p>With a criminal investigation by the LAPD remaining open, Doe sought $21.5m damages in a civil lawsuit, which alleged she was drugged and that the men committed trespass, battery and sexual battery.</p> <p>It was a lie, a hoax, said Baute, speaking over breakfast in Malibu, where he has a home. \u201cShe wanted money and she was angry that she had been dumped.\u201d Rose had apparently ended their relationship several weeks before the disputed night.</p> <p>The drugging accusation was fabricated and the sex at her apartment was consensual, he said. He described it as \u201cjust four people in their 20s having a fun night\u201d.</p> <p>Baute \u2013 who surfs, plays basketball and sports cropped grey hair \u2013 acknowledges being abrasive; the only way to survive decades of \u201cgunslinging\u201d in downtown LA courtrooms, he said. </p> <p>He conceded, however, that his colleague Michael Monico, who represented Hampton and Allen, should not have asked Judge Michael Fitzgerald <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8c5b0239acc846ffb2a436fd79e5e3e1/derrick-rose-fights-against-rape-allegation-civil-lawsuit\">to order Doe to stop crying</a>. </p> <p>Baute also said Doe\u2019s tears may have been partly genuine. \u201cPossibly from regret from having had intercourse that night. You also see it when someone\u2019s case starts crumbling. It can create certain emotions.\u201d</p> <p>After the verdict jurors told reporters Doe lacked credibility. \u201cI felt like she was playing us,\u201d said one. \u201cI think most of us believe it\u2019s possible there are pieces of her story that were true, but there just wasn\u2019t any evidence,\u201d said another. </p> <p>Social media bristled at images of jurors posing with Rose after the verdict but Baute said they were not wowed by the athlete\u2019s fame. \u201cThere\u2019s a myth that LA courts show favouritism to celebrities. There\u2019s actually a bias against them \u2013 many jurors believe celebrities don\u2019t behave properly.\u201d </p> <p>The great exception, OJ Simpson, beat a murder rap because of spectacularly inept prosecutors, Baute said. </p> <p>He was even more scornful about Doe\u2019s two lawyers, calling McCoy shambolic and accusing Brandon Anand of developing a co-dependent bond with Doe. Baute\u2019s court filings said the alleged victim \u201chad social interactions with Mr Anand, including getting high together\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WerlySportsLaw/status/772563581208408064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whoa, Derrick Rose&#39;s lawyer accuses Doe&#39;s attorney of &quot;getting high&quot; with his client.<br><br>This is war. <a href=\"https://t.co/XOa0Ezvxbn\">pic.twitter.com/XOa0Ezvxbn</a></p>&mdash; Dan Werly (@WerlySportsLaw) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WerlySportsLaw/status/772563581208408064\">September 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Doe\u2019s case further suffered, said Baute, from having churned through seven different lawyers.</p> <p>McCoy and Anand did not respond to interview requests in response to these claims.</p> <p>Baute expressed sympathy for \u201creal\u201d sexual assault victims.

  "<p>At the end of a fiery and fully committed contest, a draw was probably a fair result, yet ultimately both teams may well reflect on what might have been. For Tottenham Hotspur this was a chance missed to go top after largely dominating proceedings while for Bournemouth the feeling will be that having performed with great togetherness they could have won had their opponents been reduced to 10, and possibly even nine, players.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/22/bournemouth-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live\">Bournemouth 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a different day and with a referee who showed less leniency than Craig Pawson did here, both \u00c9rik Lamela and Moussa Sissoko would almost certainly have been sent off for their respective displays of recklessness. Sissoko\u2019s incident was the most blatant with the midfielder, having come on as a 72nd-minute substitute, clearly striking Harry Arter with his elbow as the pair tussled by the near touchline. Arter was enraged and complained to Pawson, but the official, despite having a clear view of what had happened, took no action. That was also the case on 40 minutes, when Lamela lunged in on Dan Gosling having already received a yellow card. The Argentinian\u2019s reaction was that of a man who expected to be dismissed, but he survived.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Sissoko\u2019s foul on Arter was raised with both managers and, perhaps also not surprisingly, both claimed not to have seen the flashpoint. Instead, Mauricio Pochettino and Eddie Howe were more interested in praising the efforts of their players, with the latter claiming this display by Bournemouth had pleased him more than the one they delivered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/bournemouth-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">defeating Hull 6-1</a> here.</p> <p>\u201cI was really proud of the players,\u201d said Howe. \u201cMore proud than I was this time last week, partly because of the quality of the opposition we were playing against.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re supremely talented players and we felt our best option was to try to stop the ball getting into the final third with our workrate and intensity. The players delivered an incredible physical performance, full of endeavour and desire.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"489f4ffb9e26a3ee134794fc84b5de4a5ea7aaf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489f4ffb9e26a3ee134794fc84b5de4a5ea7aaf4/168_123_3247_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bournemouth\u2019s Adam Smith hooks the ball away from Christian Eriksen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bournemouth\u2019s Adam Smith hooks the ball away from Christian Eriksen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that regard, no one shone more brightly than Arter, who closed down opposition players with relentless desire and was quite rightly named man of the match Yet, as Howe intimated, this was a collectively impressive display by the hosts as they looked to push Tottenham back right from kick-off. Callum Wilson led the charge, with the lone centre-forward ably supported by the attacking trio of Joshua King, Jack Wilshere and Jordon Ibe. Behind them Arter and Gosling, who came into the starting lineup just before kick-off after Andrew Surman was ruled out because of illness, restricted the ability of Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Deli Alli to dictate proceedings and cause danger from centre midfield in their usual manner.</p> <p>Bournemouth had the best chance of the match, a close-range shot from Charlie Daniels after five minutes that looked to be heading in, only for Hugo Lloris to deflect the ball on to the bar with this leg and make a second eye-catching stop in four days after his stunning block of Javier Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s close-range strike in Tuesday\u2019s Champions League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/18/bayer-leverkusen-tottenham-champions-league-match-report\">draw with Bayer Leverkusen</a>.</p> <p>Lamela almost scored for Tottenham on 17 minutes with a long-range drive but, overall, the visitors were left feeling frustrated during the first half, evident in part by the four bookings they collected during that period. A fifth, and second, for their No11 would have been justified.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/oct/14/football-alternative-world-cup-kurdistan-team-jack-losh-sebastien-rabas\">The rebel World Cup: on the road with Kurdistan's football team</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The visitors were much improved after the break and deserved to remain the only undefeated team in the Premier League given they had the lion\u2019s share of possession \u2013 61.8% \u2013 and created more chances than Bournemouth \u2013 16 compared to eight. However, few of those chances were clear cut and Son Heung-Min was largely anonymous as their lone striker. It is now one goal for Tottenham in their last three games. Harry Kane\u2019s return from injury cannot come quickly enough.</p> <p>\u201cThe game was tough but I am pleased with the efforts of my players,\u201d said Pochettino before going on to concede his side needs to be more ruthless if they are to sustain their title charge. Tottenham are fourth, one point off new leaders Arsenal.</p> <p>For Bournemouth, it is now four matches without defeat and soon after Sissoko\u2019s strike on Arter \u2013 who said he received an apology from the Tottenham player for the elbow, which he accepted, saying \u201che isn\u2019t that type of player\u201d \u2013 there was one more moment for the majority of those in attendance to feel hard done by.</p> <p>Wilshere \u2013 who completed a full match for the first time since September 2014 \u2013 went down under a seemingly illegal challenge from Victor Wanyama inside the Tottenham area.

  "<p>The very inclusion of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG) to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/\">reduce inequality</a> is a gamechanger.<br></p> <p>For a generation or more, any serious mainstream discussions of inequality had been off the table. In the formulation of the millennium development goals all the key players knew that income or asset inequality was to be kept off the agenda. Governing elites and international organisations would hardly acknowledge it as a relevant concept for development, often dismissing inequality focused academics and activists as hard-leftists. Many commentators vehemently argued that inequality promoted competition, by reducing inefficiency, which in turn created jobs and profit.</p> <p>The global financial crash of 2008 and the fallout that continues to affect so many people, has changed the conversation. A small group of people made vast profits while tens of millions lost their jobs, houses and dignity. The evidence of the damage to society caused by high levels of inequality has been re-examined, while new research and popular <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum\">campaigns</a> have seen a new consensus form relatively rapidly. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/05/sustainable-development-goals-most-difficult-targets\">How can we reach an SDG target when we're moving in the wrong direction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett set the ball rolling in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/13/the-spirit-level\">The Spirit Level</a>. They argued that rising inequality in rich nations negatively impacts on our physical and mental health, education, experience of work and even life satisfaction, and is associated with the use of illegal drugs and mental illness. Detailed studies by <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=780485\">Martin Ravallion</a> and World Bank colleagues showed that as inequality rose in poor countries, the poverty-reducing impacts of economic growth declined. Subsequent work revealed how rising inequality also slowed downs rates of improvement in human development indicators. Rising income inequality was bad for the citizens of both rich and poor countries. </p> <p>The SDG for reducing inequality, with a specific target to \u201cprogressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average\u201d encapsulates the broad acceptance of the perils of inequality, not just between countries, but within them. The fact that the target applies and demands action from all countries enhances its potency as evidence of shifting global norms. </p> <p>However, this is not a radical goal, such as arguing that top incomes must be capped or that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient\">Gini coefficient</a> must be reduced every year. Rather, it is a modest, reformist goal that seeks to ensure that those at the bottom of the income scale are not left behind as economic growth moves forward. </p> <p>Yet for all the evidence, the hand-wringing from business elites at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/davos-2015-tackling-inequality-world-economic-forum\">Davos</a>, calls from parties across the political spectrum and increasing disaffection with the status quo from those left behind (at least in rich nations), relatively little is being done to seriously address the problem of rising inequality around the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since 2000, the incomes of the bottom 40% have experienced slower growth year in, year out. Inequality is rising at spectacular rates. While different measures (wealth or income), different datasets (national accounts or taxation) and different analysts disagree on the detail, they all agree that the wealthiest are getting richer faster than anyone else (except in Latin America). The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008.</p> <p>Turning this situation around will take a Herculean effort, for two main reasons. First, contemporary capitalism is based on economic processes that permit those who manage to amass money by their brain power or political connections or both, to increase their wealth faster than others. As Thomas Piketty tells us, the returns to capital (owning physical and financial assets) are greater than the returns to labour (working). So the rich get richer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/23/paradigm-shift-needed-governments-fight-poverty-inequality\">A 'paradigm shift' is needed from governments to fight poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly, when the rich get richer, they have the ability to keep it that way. They are able to shape national and international public policies to such an extent that they remain on a rising tide of prosperity. They can also safeguard national and international patent and competition laws, enabling them to dominate the markets in which they operate, and influence rules which allow them to avoid paying tax. </p> <p>To top it all, by gaining control of the media plutocrats, the super-rich even persuade the public that inequality is good for everyone. Billionaire Donald Trump somehow becomes the voice of those left behind. Gold taps in private jets seem to be a qualification for public office in what Francis Fukuyama terms \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-rise-of-trump-brought-to-you-by-the-decay-of-americas-institutions/2016/03/10/ca6438b4-e6f2-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?utm_term=.a9c7aff2c01c\">political decay</a>\u201d in the US.</p> <p>So what can be done? Few support the 20th century revolutionary solution of seizing and redistributing land and assets, as happened after the second world war in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Perhaps more reformist measures are a more popular 21st century answer? In most low income countries, effective public expenditure on domestically-financed education, health and social protection would raise the prospects for sustained growth, structural transformation and welfare advances. The evidence for such policies is clear but, enacting them in the places they are most needed is very problematic. The nature of domestic business and political elites \u2013 often greedy, extractive and predatory \u2013 allied to international business elites and the social norms they transmit, means that socially beneficial policies are not effectively implemented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f156da1939bf531ce7ed3ec5edf66eed6ceba9d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f156da1939bf531ce7ed3ec5edf66eed6ceba9d1/0_0_3210_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her Bolsa Familia social plan card.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her bolsa familia social plan card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanderlei Almeida/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Significantly reducing inequality doesn\u2019t have to be the stuff of utopian dreamers. In Brazil, a sustained decline in inequality levels has been of the most striking aspects of its development performance over the last 10 years. In addition to raising an estimated 40 million people out of poverty, the Brazil\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2014&amp;start=2014&amp;view=map\">Gini coefficient fell by 12%, from 0.59 in 1995 to 0.52 in 2012</a>. While inequality in Brazil remains high, this reduction stands in stark contrast to other OECD and Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, which have seen levels rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/oct/18/the-e-waste-reduce-waste-old-technology-mountains-in-pictures\">The e-waste mountains - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently published research <a href=\"http://www.brazil4africa.org/\">investigating the Brazilian development model</a> looked in detail at the factors behind this trend. An estimated 35-50% of the reduction in inequality in Brazil can be attributed to changes in non-labour incomes, largely as a result of growing social assistance programmes. Despite costing just 0.7% of GDP, the extremely effective targeting of the  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/brazil-bolsa-familia-decade-anniversary-poverty-relief\"><em>bolsa familia</em></a>, a conditional cash transfer scheme, has been vital. A further 10% or so can be attributed to demographic factors, particularly the declining household size among poorer families. The remaining 40-55% is attributed to changes in the distribution of labour earnings. This had previously been attributed to the effects of an increasingly educated workforce, but our research suggests that reduced wage gaps for women and ethnic minorities actually made the biggest impact.</p> <p>Achieving the SDG target to reduce inequality will require a huge shift in how economies and political systems operate right around the world. Some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, demonstrate that sustained reductions in inequality are achievable, when there\u2019s a fairly explicit shift in the social contract, enabling politically difficult decisions to be taken and sustained over a long period. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/angus-deaton-wins-nobel-prize-in-economics\">Angus Deaton tells us</a>, humanity has made amazing progress in reducing income poverty and raising health standards. The next big task is reducing inequality so that we can all enjoy a better life. </p> <p>Reducing inequality in every country will be extremely difficult. But a growing tide of protest and its consequences (sometimes socially progressive and sometimes regressive) may persuade the 1% that they will not get the world they want for their grandchildren if business continues as usual.</p> <p><em></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Selling on the streets is hard. It doesn\u2019t matter if one is slinging handbags or doughnuts, shish kebab or art \u2013 vending is for those who are tough. The hours are long, the pay low and precarious. Competition is cutthroat, and cops drown you in tickets. Worse, the space legally available to vend keeps shrinking. Which is why, on a rainy summer afternoon, two dozen street vendors gathered in Times Square to demand their place in the city.</p> <p>The group was barely noticeable amid the crush of tourists, private security and grubby ersatz Spider-Men. Their signs were handmade; some presented simple demands: more permits, fewer tickets and restricted streets, and an end to the 20ft rule that keeps vendors from working near building entrances. Others insisted the vendors were workers with families to feed.</p> <p>Osama Khatlan strode the front of the crowd. He wore a cape made from the hundreds of tickets he and other vendors had received for various offenses such as \u201cvending in a restricted area\u201d<strong>.</strong></p> <p>An Iraqi artist in his mid-50s, Khatlan is a lifelong activist. Declined entry to university for refusing to sign a Baathist loyalty pledge, Khatlan learned his trade illustrating for communist newspapers, and spent the late 1970s resisting Saddam Hussain alongside Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq\u2019s north. While Khatlan exhibits his fine art internationally, he makes his living in part as a portrait artist in Times Square. He began organizing with other street artists informally in the 1990s, after other vendors attempted to threaten a Haitian artist out of his spot. Khatlan intervened and physically defended him. </p> <p>Through the years, he also witnessed police harassment and arrest of his colleagues. During one such arrest, police complained to Khatlan that street vendors made New York resemble Baghdad. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m from Baghdad,\u201d he answered furiously.</p> <p>The group Khatlan addressed that rainy day was a cosmopolitan group \u2013 a Latina burrito vendor, Chinese artists who make graceful name paintings, a west African handbag seller working in Queens, as well as a smattering of organizers. To the chant of \u201cvendor power!\u201d and waving banners, they headed downtown. </p> <p>The march snaked down 8th Avenue, until it arrived in front of the Midtown South precinct police station. The officers eyed them suspiciously. Out came the barricades. Khatlan began another speech: \u201cWe sell art to showcase the beauty of this great city. We are not criminals!\u201d</p> <p>Despite their timeless presence in New York \u2013 where, according to a report by the <a href=\"http://ij.org/press-release/groundbreaking-report-highlights-economic-impact-of-new-york-city-vendors/\">Institute for Justice</a>, they contribute $293m annually to the economy \u2013 street vendors are embattled on all sides: by the police, by the brick-and-mortar storeowners who view them as unfair competition, by the bureaucracy that they believe strangles their ability to make a livelihood. </p> <p>Cops slap vendors with tickets that can eat up half their take-home pay. BIDs (Business Improvement Districts, or areas where business owners pay an extra tax to fund services) deploy private security to hassle vendors, and use their influence with the city to lobby for the closure of more streets. To BIDs, vendors like Khatlan are flies in the ointment of the sleek corporate neighborhoods they hope to build. To vendors, who are working class and predominantly immigrants, it\u2019s a battle for more than survival. </p> <p>They\u2019re fighting for the right to be ambitious in New York.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Donald Trump led a jeremiad to close Fifth Avenue to street vendors. \u201cThe street-peddler plague is infecting the entire city of New York,\u201d he <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=JuUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=The+street-peddler+plague+is+infecting+the+entire+City+of+New+York&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nTHdwbS19L&amp;sig=NtSXQ_Op2xDBJKIOkzPYpwIbEBk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivkpW_3-nPAhUBRSYKHVTcA-oQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20street-peddler%20plague%20is%20infecting%20the%20entire%20City%20of%20New%20York&amp;f=false\">said</a> a few years earlier, in 1987. His words could speak for many members of the city elite.</p> <p>New York glorifies entrepreneurship. We love the hustler, the poor boy or girl who made good. We\u2019re the city of Jay Z and Madonna. We fetishize the scrappy businessman who bleeds for his dream. Yet as the city becomes more gentrified, and the police ubiquitous, there\u2019s less and less space for poor people who work for themselves. This goes double if those people are brown, immigrants or can\u2019t speak English, like most of the protesters in front of the 8th Avenue police station.</p> <p>After a half hour, the station sent out a detective.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked Khatlan.</p> <p>\u201cWe are here to say please respect us, respect us as business owners,\u201d Khatlan answered. He demanded to know why he kept receiving criminal charges while doing his art.</p> <p>The officer smirked. \u201cThe police department isn\u2019t in charge of legislation.\u201d</p> <p> The vendors presented a petition. The police moved them to the other side of the street. They stayed for another half hour, beneath the slow drizzle of summer rain. Time passed, work called and soon the protest dissolved into the city.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>A labyrinthine bureaucracy governs a street vendor\u2019s life. Fifty-four pages of rules regulate food sellers, covering health rules, limiting them to certain streets, even forbidding them from tucking their licenses into their shirts. If vendors sometimes don\u2019t fully understand the rules, police know them even less, leaving a huge margin for miscommunication, error and quota-fulfilling tickets. </p> <p>In 2015, the city\u2019s environmental control board wrote 18,744 vending violation tickets.</p> <p>\u201cVendors are kind of sitting ducks,\u201d Sean Basinski told me. \u201cThey are out there in the same spot every day. Imagine that you are a police officer and you need to write a ticket to somebody \u2026 There are so many rules [for vendors]. They are either breaking one or you could say that they are breaking one. They are almost definitely going to be an immigrant who is going to be scared of you, and they are not going to file a complaint against you.\u201d</p> <p>Basinski is the director of the <a href=\"http://streetvendor.org/\">Street Vendors Project</a> (SVP), the group that called the Times Square demonstration. Basinski founded SVP in 2001 when he was just 23, after a summer working as a burrito vendor during law school. The Giuliani administration had just closed many streets to vendors, and Basinski became involved in a wave of organizing. </p> <p> One of SVP\u2019s major goals is to persuade the city to increase the amount of permits it issues. Because of first amendment protection, artists and booksellers need no license to sell on the streets, and in New York, disabled veterans also have the right to vend. Everyone else needs a permit. The city caps these at 3,000 and the waiting list stretches for decades, so frustrated vendors turn to the black market, where one vendor told me that the $200 permits can go for up to $20,000<strong>.</strong></p> <p>SVP, which has 2,000 members, functions at once as an activist group, professional association, and legal aid society for vendors. They maintain an emergency fund for vendors, a small business lending program and an annual food cart competition. At their monthly meetings, vendors organize around grievances, network and give each other moral support. </p> <p>On the legal front, the SVP has won some major victories, including the reduction of a vendors\u2019 maximum ticket from $1,000 to $250 in 2013. SVP\u2019s staff lawyer helps vendors fight these civil tickets, but they don\u2019t have the resources to represent their members in criminal court. No clear, public data is available on the number of vendors charged with misdemeanors, but the vendors I spoke to reported it was a constant concern. Khatlan has received 60 criminal tickets, as well as 90 civil ones. Most were dismissed, but a few times, he was sentenced to attend a class, or waste a day stamping envelopes or cleaning streets. </p> <p>Unlicensed vendors also face potentially violent arrests, or worse: in 2014, SVP members marched in solidarity with Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who died after officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a chokehold during an arrest.</p> <p>Immigrant vendors who don\u2019t speak English face particular difficulties, said Angela Ni, a legal intern with the Street Vendors Project. Ni got involved with the organization at 13, interpreting for her father, a Chinese immigrant who drew portraits in Times Square. Many of the artists her father worked with had been newspaper illustrators in China, and some studied at the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts, but in America, their inability to speak English led them to practice their trade on the streets. </p> <p>Over the last 10 years, Ni watched the already tense relationship between the artists, the police and the BID deteriorate. \u201cThey should feel protected by the police, but they feel persecuted,\u201d she said. Banned from most Times Square streets before 7pm, artists work till past midnight for between $50 and $100 a day, but see up to half their incomes swallowed by tickets.</p> <p>This is what happened to De Zhao, who has drawn caricatures of tourists in Times Square for the last eight years. </p> <p>I met Zhao at the Midtown community court, where he was dealing with a charge for \u201cvending on a restricted sidewalk\u201d. Through a translator, Zhao spoke about the discrimination endured by Chinese artists, who \u201cdon\u2019t have any way of explaining themselves or fighting back\u201d. Zhao described a squad of six cops who he says often targeted him, shoving arbitrary tickets into his hand without bothering to speak to or look at him. When he asked for explanations, the police just wrote more tickets. </p> <p> \u201cThe police need to be more concerned with getting the bad guys, with helping people instead of oppressing them,\u201d he said, frustration making him speak faster. \u201cBut what can I do? I don\u2019t understand any English.\u201d </p> <p>The Midtown community court was founded in 1993, during the start of efforts to \u201cclean up\u201d Times Square. It is sold as a kinder, gentler, \u201cproblem solving\u201d court, where defendants are sentenced to community service, classes or rehab rather than incarceration. At first, police rounded up the sex workers, touts and three-card Monte dealers who gave Times Square its seediness \u2013 but street vendors were also on the list. </p> <p>The court is a public-private partnership, and from the beginning received significant financial contributions from the Fifth Avenue Association, a local BID. </p> <p>New York\u2019s first BID hit Union Square in 1984. They\u2019ve since proliferated wildly. New York now hosts 72, more than any other city in the country, and the relationships between BIDs and the police have always been close. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1266&amp;context=ylpr\">Yale study</a> released a year after the court\u2019s foundation wrote \u201cthe fact that strong private interests are making significant financial contributions to the court has caused many criminal justice officials to voice questions about the propriety of such contributions. Many of the people interviewed expressed their concern that the court was the direct result of a rich special interest buying its own system of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Claims of undue influence are also raised by Midtown community court conditions panel meetings that take place between the DA, judges, police and members of local BIDs. Though technically open to the public, these meetings are not advertised, and it took the Street Vendors Project considerable time to find out when they are held. </p> <p>Basinski, who attended several of them, described a judge who drilled police on how to write tickets that wouldn\u2019t get dismissed. (The Times Square Alliance BID declined requests to comment on this article.)</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Videos become the vendors\u2019 testimony to their experiences. </p> <p>Mohammed Omar, a kebab cart vendor, showed me a cellphone video footage he\u2019d taken to document harassment by the BID\u2019s private security. In the video, the guard approached Omar\u2019s kebab cart aggressively, saying something I couldn\u2019t make out. \u201cEvery day you bother me,\u201d shouted Omar. When he saw Omar was filming him, he covered his face. </p> <p>Omar, who\u2019s also a board member of the SVP, told me that two weeks before I met him in July at the Urban Justice Center\u2019s offices, a police officer tried to ticket him for selling during restricted hours. When he explained his cart was closed, the officer barked at him to shut up, and when, as SVP advocates, he took out his camera to document the interaction, the officer threatened him with arrest, then slapped him with another ticket. </p> <p>Omar started working on the streets at 22, selling vegetables in his hometown of Port Said, Egypt. Business flourished, and he soon owned a clothing store but in 2011, he packed up his wife and five kids and moved to America. He didn\u2019t mention the revolution that broke out that year, telling me only: \u201cAmerica is a free country. It\u2019s safe here for women to walk on the street.\u201d</p> <p>In New York, Omar got a job at a food cart owned by another Egyptian immigrant. If he was restarting his life, he figured, he might as well start on the street.</p> <p>On Omar\u2019s second day, a cop slapped him with five tickets he couldn\u2019t hope to pay. Not knowing enough English to protest, Omar broke down in frustration. Seeing his distress, a fellow food cart worker told him about the Street Vendors Project. Soon, he was going to all their meetings, and, as his English improved, he joined the group\u2019s board.</p> <p>Omar owns his own cart now, and he\u2019s taken on his friend\u2019s daughter, Doa Abdolla, as an assistant. She has also joined the SVP leadership board. </p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>New York tells itself a story. It goes like this. We are sharp-elbowed bastards who live in filth, surrounded by sewer rats, but with enough chutzpah, drive and determination, any of us can rise high enough to scrape the sky. It\u2019s a myth, of course, and like all myths, it contains a narrow shard of truth. But with each year that shard shrinks, under the weight of gentrification, corporations and police. People like Khatlan and Omar fight to keep it alive.</p> <p>It was Ramadan when I interviewed Omar, so he invited me to break the fast with him at his cart. Beforehand, I wandered through Times Square. A few topless showgirls were all that remained of the neighborhood\u2019s outlaw cachet, but the streets are still theaters of working-class, largely immigrant ambition. Beggars demanded money for Viagra. Disabled veterans sold scarves. Touts hollered in praise of comedy shows, and dozens of blinking, smoking halal food carts offered cheap plates of protein that have fed generations of workers. </p> <p>On the billboards, Global Capital reigned supreme, but the streets still surged with the human-scale hustle that has always defined this city. </p> <p>When I found Omar\u2019s stall, it was a few moments before sunset, and he was dying for a cigarette. As observant Muslims, he and Doa refrained from food and water during Ramadan\u2019s daylight hours \u2013 a hard task in their line of work. In his free moments, Omar laid out supplies. Dates, a sticky fruit drink called Qmar-al-din, and skewers of lamb. Finally, the sky darkened. Despite the neon, we could make out the moon. </p> <p>\u201cEat!\u201d Omar demanded in Arabic and shoved twin mountains of food towards me and Doa. Then, he lit a cigarette.</p> <p>Business was slow, he said. Vendors who owned several carts were stealing spots, and officers bedeviled him with tickets. But he worked for his kids, not himself.</p> <p>Then he smiled. \u201cI like the streets.\u201d He said. \u201cI think, if today is not good, there\u2019s tomorrow. If this week is not good, there\u2019s the next. If I take one day off, what can I do? Relax? That\u2019s not life. The street is my life.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>This is an exceptionally exciting time for sculpture. In the last few weeks, the Turner prize has given a platform to artists such as Michael Dean, whose installation at Tate Britain looks at modern poverty with the help of millions of pennies and a \u201cfamily\u201d made of corrugated iron.

Sculpture has become a significant part of public life in the UK \u2013 which is why the Hepworth Wakefield museum is launching a prize to celebrate it.</p> <p>More than any other art form, sculpture engages and confronts us directly. We are obliged, in a way we are not with wall-based 2D work, to share our own space with it; we have to move around it, look over, through or into it. And since we negotiate an object-based physical world every day, we are already primed for the bodily experience of sculpture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/21/phyllida-barlow-shortlist-hepworth-prize-sculpture\">Phyllida Barlow on shortlist for Hepworth sculpture prize</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a particular fascination with the way sculptures are created.

Sculpture has a protean ability to reinvent itself. The early part of the 20th century saw Picasso\u2019s radical experiments in sculpture escape the stifling confines of solid volumes to present shifting planes offering varied perspectives \u2013 providing the basis of cubism\u2019s new multifaceted worldview. Marcel Duchamp\u2019s notorious \u201creadymade\u201d <em>Fountain</em> from 1917, which consisted of a standard urinal signed \u201cR Mutt\u201d, went further by changing the way an everyday object was experienced and used, while testing the meanings, values and beliefs associated with art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcfa6e4e15a5d6e86d2e7aa9e44ca969a4af48e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcfa6e4e15a5d6e86d2e7aa9e44ca969a4af48e2/0_547_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Marten\u2019s Drunk Brown House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Marten\u2019s <em>Drunk Brown House.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annik Wetter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain wasn\u2019t left behind: leading European modernists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jan/03/1\">Constantin Brancusi</a>, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti proved hugely influential on two of our most important sculptors, Hepworth and Henry Moore, soon to be followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/16/anthony-caro-in-yorkshire-review-sculpture-that-can-take-your-breath-away\">Anthony Caro</a>.

These group names were little more than shorthand for fascinating and quite disparate bodies of individual work. This naming of British groups also tended to disconnect them from their international peers, as though art were not a global phenomenon.</p> <p>The surprising thing is that in spite of the strength and reputation of contemporary British sculpture, there has until now been no UK prize for sculptors.

  "<p>As a child, I was obsessed with ornamental birds and chickens. I would ask to go to Chatsworth House to see the Duchess of Devonshire\u2019s poultry; and as a young teenager, I worked at a place called Newstead Abbey, which has peacocks.

While I was learning the technical side at Kew Gardens, I started visiting my gardening idol, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahraven\">Sarah Raven</a>, at <a href=\"https://www.sarahraven.com/customer/pages/open-days\">Perch Hill Farm in Sussex</a>. I was incredibly lucky to have three months house-sitting for her there. I learned to combine colours and forms in a container, using the floristry rule of a central heart or filler and a taller horizon.</p> <p>It is essentially container gardening on a grand scale here at <a href=\"http://www.emmabridgewater.co.uk/en/uk/about-us/our-factory-in-stoke/page/ourfactoryinstoke\">the Emma Bridgewater ceramics factory</a>.

We are the only pottery with a cut-flower garden.</p> <p>From March to mid-November, we don\u2019t buy flowers for the factory shop. Most of the plants start off in a couple of greenhouses on the roof directly above a kiln. This is great for germinating seeds in winter, but more of a challenge in summer. There is no room in the garden for plants to look past their best. I can\u2019t give the public any room to say their sweet peas, or whatever, are better than mine.

  "<p>Four in 10 of Britain\u2019s local authorities breached legal air quality limits last year, largely due to heavy road traffic, government records reveal.</p> <p>Ministers have admitted that 169 local authorities were found to have gone over annual limits on nitrogen dioxide. It is an invisible gas produced predominantly by road traffic, and is linked to lung disease and cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>Monitoring stations in councils across all four nations of the UK recorded breaches of the legal limits on NO2, data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs shows.</p> <p>A report in April from the environment, food and rural affairs select committee stated that poor air quality was linked to more than 40,000 premature deaths in the UK every year. The committee is chaired by Neil Parish, the Tory MP who obtained the latest figures from the government.</p> <p>Parish said he was working with the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue to secure the power and funding to introduce a clean air zone in pollution hotspots in all local authorities. This month, the government made available \u00a33m for councils to bid for funding to improve air quality.</p> <p>Parish said: \u201cThese are shocking statistics. When we think of areas breaking air quality laws, we usually think of a handful of areas in our busiest towns and cities. These figures show just how widespread the problem is across the UK. It requires a comprehensive solution \u2013 urgently\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government needs to act now to give all councils the power \u2013 and crucially, the funding \u2013 to implement a clean air zone and limit the most polluting vehicles in hotspot areas. The \u00a33m government funding pot is a start but not nearly enough. We also need a big push to incentivise electric and low emissions vehicles to replace the oldest, most polluting vehicles.\u201d</p> <p>The government is being hauled before the courts over its failure to tackle the levels of nitrogen dioxide. A 1999 European Union directive set legal limits that came into force in 2010. Now the legal activist group, ClientEarth, is asking the high court to order ministers to come up with a better plan for improving air quality.</p> <p>Sam Hall, environment researcher at Bright Blue, said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/treasury-blocked-moves-to-charge-diesel-cars-to-enter-polluted-uk-cities\">worst polluting cars</a> should be banned from cities in order to tackle the problem. \u201cForty percent of local authorities in the UK breached legal air pollution limits last year,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor air quality is clearly a national public health issue that requires urgent action.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s current plans for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\"> clean air zones</a> in just five cities do not go far enough. Ministers should enable all city councils to set up clean air zones to restrict the dirtiest cars from urban centres.</p> <p>\u201cTogether with measures to encourage greater uptake of electric vehicles, this approach would reduce air pollution, cut carbon emissions and boost automotive manufacturing in the UK.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Five Links housing estate on the outskirts of Basildon, Essex, could never be called lovely. Built in the late 60s, it is made up of a series of interlocking courtyards crisscrossed with alleyways and blind corners. Walking from one side to the other is like tackling a red-brick maze. \u201cYou can see why we call it Alcatraz,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.basildonmeetings.info/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=2051\">Frank Ferguson</a>, a local councillor, as he shows me round.</p> <p>Basildon council wants to rid the estate (home to 1,300 residents) of its Alcatraz reputation. It started a decade ago, by pulling down a block of flats whose underground car park had become a venue for drug dealing. Now it wants to change all the street names. Out will go those of <a href=\"http://www.basildon.com/history/laindon/5links.html\">the original \u201cfive links\u201d</a>, all named after English villages or farms (Somercotes, Mellow Purgess, Brendon, Handley Green or Newberry Side) and after which all the estate\u2019s roads are named.</p> <p>Instead, the streets are being named after flowers. This month, signs for Wisteria Court, Lobelia Mews, Arabis Place, Begonia Drive and Orchid Place have started appearing. But many of the residents are not happy. Milinda Rydqvist moved into 112 Mellow Purgess in 1986; soon her address will be renamed Gardenia Court. \u201cI feel that by changing the names, Five Links will no longer exist,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the council\u2019s way of completely shutting us away.\u201d</p> <p>I met her, and half a dozen unhappy locals, in one of the estate\u2019s many courtyards. Rydqvist, 71, is a softly spoken former City secretary, but there is a quiet anger to her. Like many, she believes the council\u2019s floral scheme is no more than a metaphorical hanging basket tacked on to a decrepit house. \u201cIt means they don\u2019t need to do anything more for us \u2013 they don\u2019t need to do repairs, to mow the lawn.\u201d</p> <p>Her fellow resident John James agrees. A former refinery worker standing over 6ft tall, he is more robust in his view of his home\u2019s change from 416 Somercotes to 12 Bellflower Mews. \u201cIt\u2019s just to make it sound pretty. But it isn\u2019t any nicer. Look at that over there,\u201d he says, pointing to a washing machine fly-tipped on to a patch of scruffy grass.</p> <p>Last year the residents, backed by Ferguson, a Ukip councillor, took the Conservative-controlled council to court, challenging the name changes on the grounds that the process was unnecessary and did not have the overwhelming support of locals; an estimated 53% of the 533 households affected submitted letters of complaint. They won the initial case in the magistrates court, but the council fought back, taking it all the way to the high court and eventually winning on appeal.</p> <p>It is not just the hassle of the renaming process to which residents object, meaning they\u2019ll having to rechip their pets and inform their utility companies (the council insists it will pick up the bulk of the administration and costs for this). They want to keep the old street names because they have become a part of their identity. Rydqvist tells me that, for her, \u201cMellow Purgess has an emotional and sentimental attachment. When my grandson was born, he couldn\u2019t say my name; he used to say \u2018Nanna Mellow Purgess\u2019. He\u2019s grown up now, and he still does.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>For many of us, street names are no more than simple signposts. In an era of postcodes and satnavs, Britain\u2019s 1,795 Church Lanes merge with its 573 Chapel Streets. Does it really matter if you live on Alexandra Road or George Street, Mellow Purgess or Gardenia Court?</p> <p>Many experts believe it does. If nothing else, most of us say or type our street name on a daily basis, as we give our physical address over the telephone or enter it into a website. \u201cFor most of us, it is our cultural capital, our cultural history,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/people/Laura.Wright/\">Dr Laura Wright</a>, reader in English language at Cambridge University, who has studied the history of medieval and 18th-century place, street and business names, particularly in London. \u201cAnd it is observed in the breach \u2013 you most notice it when a street name is changed. It\u2019s the same as a church being knocked down: you may never have walked into that church, you may not be religious, and yet, to most of us, it is an affront, an insult: \u2018Someone has changed my environment without consulting me.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Blue Anchor Way in Milton Keynes was vetoed recently as potentially sounding like \u2018wanker\u2019, if said very quickly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That environment is evolving all the time, but changing street names, as Basildon council has done, is unusual. According to the Royal Mail, which keeps a log of all British street names, 494 streets were renamed last year. That may sound a lot, but it\u2019s a small percentage of the estimated 858,000 streets in the UK \u2013 and nearly all of these were small adjustments to help clear up satnav anomalies. (For instance, a Back Lane in Hull was renamed Back Road to avoid confusion with another Back Lane five miles away.)</p> <p>Far more common is the addition of fresh names, as developers lay out new housing estates where fields or factories once stood. Last year, 6,984 new names appeared, many celebrating Britain\u2019s plants and animals, some honouring local worthies, others trying to inject a bit of history into an otherwise modern development. A few attempt something altogether more ambitious. How new streets get their names is a fascinating story, and one that highlights the tension between those in power and those they rule.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/71/part/II/crossheading/naming-of-streets\">Public Health Act 1925</a>, street names are the responsibility of local authorities. Each authority has a street-naming and numbering officer, or an entire department, and takes a different view on what is and isn\u2019t OK.</p> <p>They agree that their primary aim is to avoid confusing the emergency services and Royal Mail: duplicates and names that are difficult to spell are invariably ruled out, along with anything potentially offensive. We appear to be far more sensitive than in the days of Bell End in Rowley Regis or The Knob in Kings Sutton. Recently, Blue Anchor Way in Milton Keynes was vetoed as potentially sounding like \u201cwanker\u201d, if said very quickly.</p> <p>In the 80s, street-naming departments were very active, not least Labour-run departments with anti-Thatcher axes to grind. A generation before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/the-real-meaning-of-rhodes-must-fall\">the Rhodes Must Fall campaign</a>, some councils altered streets honouring prominent imperialists; there was a push for roads to be named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela\">Nelson Mandela</a>, sometimes against the wishes of locals, who thought it would discourage new businesses. In 1988, a magistrate backed a group of Dewsbury businesses who objected to the West Yorkshire council attempting to change a Rishworth Road into Mandela Way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f040090c3ec5ca3a739fcd1816e651cdff51906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f040090c3ec5ca3a739fcd1816e651cdff51906/4386_2450_1331_955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Montage of images of houses and street signs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Some local authorities are really anal about what streets are called, others don\u2019t care that much.\u2019 Photographs: Alamy; Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy, Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, many local authorities have neither the resources nor the inclination to get involved, especially with so little council housing being built. Instead, they leave the job of picking names almost entirely to developers, retaining only the right to veto. This gives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/taylorwimpey\">Taylor Wimpey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/persimmon\">Persimmon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/barrattdevelopments\">Barratt Homes</a> the same power to shape maps as was wielded by aristocratic landlords in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Bedford Estate, for instance, is still a major landlord around the British Museum in London, and responsible for anything called Tavistock, Howland, Woburn, Russell, Gower and Bedford \u2013 all of them places and titles connected to the Duke of Bedford.</p> <p>Jason Stokes, sales and marketing manager for Taylor Wimpey in the south-east, is the duke\u2019s modern-day equivalent. He reckons he is responsible for more than 1,000 names that now appear on maps. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of legacy, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he says. \u201cYou can drive down that road in 30 or 40 years\u2019 time and say, \u2018I named that.\u2019 I enjoy it. You can get quite a buzz out of it.\u201d</p> <p>The key, he says, is to find a historical link to the plot of land without plumping for something too obvious, another Winston Churchill Drive. Sometimes, that involves consulting a local historian or the council\u2019s street-naming department. \u201cIt really depends on the local authority,\u201d Stokes says. \u201cSome are really anal about what streets are called, others don\u2019t care that much. I\u2019ve been doing this job for 20-odd years and I\u2019ve always tried to avoid boring, generic names unrelated to the site.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/kent/dartford/the-bridge\">The Bridge development in Dartford, Kent</a>, which has 800 new homes and is built on the site of a former hospital, is one of Stokes\u2019s most recent projects. Phase one was named after the doctors and nurses who worked there: Hyde Grove memorialises a matron who served on one of the hospital ships moored in this stretch of the Thames at the end of the 19th century. Phase two was named after Britain\u2019s engineering history, with Vickers Lane running into Vimy Drive, honouring the <a href=\"http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=836\">Vickers Vimy biplane</a>, which first took off from a nearby airfield. \u201cWhen we sat down with Dartford council, they were keen to keep some of the history,\u201d Stokes explains.</p> <p>But they went for something a bit more daring for phase three: the Rolling Stones. One of Stokes\u2019s original team members lived in the area: \u201cHe knew that Mick and Keith had met on a Dartford railway platform.\u201d The council put up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/15/in-praise-of-platform-two-dartford-rolling-stones\">a plaque on platform two</a> last year, to record the moment in October 1961 when a 17-year-old Richards, carrying a H\u00f6fner cutaway electric guitar, struck up a conversation about the blues records the 18-year-old Jagger was clutching.</p> <p>\u201cThe council loved the idea,\u201d Stokes says. So the new streets are called Ruby Tuesday Drive, Angie Mews, Sympathy Vale, Cloud Close, Lady Jane Place and Rambler Lane. \u201cI thought it was a nice touch,\u201d he smiles.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Crouch End, north London, a development of 28 flats demonstrates what happens when a lack of imagination is taken to its logical conclusion. A side street created a decade ago was named Primezone Mews, after the small developer who built the flats (Primezone Ltd). \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible,\u201d resident Sophie Rushmore says. \u201cIt sounds like you are living in a corporate version of Butlin\u2019s, like something out of a video game.\u201d</p> <p>Celine Caux, an IT director, was the second resident to move in. \u201cI thought it was a temporary name,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people thought that at first. The fact that it was the name of the developers made us feel we were being branded.\u201d</p> <p>The original residents tried to get the name changed, formed a committee and appealed to the council. \u201cThe difficulty was that we needed all the freeholders to agree. Most people said they\u2019d like to see the name changed, but getting them to actually sign all the paperwork was another matter.\u201d They eventually gave up, and the street remains Primezone Mews.</p> <p>Most councils say they like involving the local community in naming new streets, but residents, even ones with strong views, have very little power to reverse a name once a developer has got it signed off. Even if you do get everyone\u2019s consent (in some areas, two-thirds will suffice), you then have to pay administrative costs. The council usually charges a fee of \u00a3500, insists the residents pay for a full consultation, and then there is the cost of the signs themselves, usually \u00a3100 each.</p> <p>Caux has since moved to Hertfordshire. \u201cBut I occasionally go past, and the fact that it is a cheap name reflects on the place, I think. It hasn\u2019t aged very well. The people who first moved in were all young, successful professionals, but it soon changed and became more of a rental market, and people stopped respecting the place. The name, I really think, did influence it. If it had had a lovely, posh name, it might have been a different story. I know that sounds awful.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s true, names do have a value. <a href=\"http://www.zoopla.co.uk\">Zoopla</a>, the online estate agency, calculates that the average property price on Britain\u2019s 233 Rectory Lanes is \u00a3452,000, compared with \u00a3153,000 on its 324 Union Roads. This is partly because the former tend to be in picturesque old villages and the latter are more likely to be Victorian terraces (they are usually named after the 1801 Act of Union), but the differing values reflect more than just the architecture. Developers, who need to sell as many houses as they can as quickly as possible, know the average home on a \u201clane\u201d fetches more than twice that on a \u201cstreet\u201d. This is why you won\u2019t see many \u201cstreets\u201d on a new housing estate.</p> <p><a href=\"http://people.uwe.ac.uk/Pages/person.aspx?accountname=campus%5Cr2-coates\">Richard Coates</a>, professor of linguistics at the University of the West of England in Bristol and a student of street names, has a few theories. \u201cIs it the association of the word street \u2013 street urchins and street walkers?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou don\u2019t get avenue urchins, do you?\u201d He adds that the avoidance of \u201cstreet\u201d started in the interwar period, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia\">John Betjeman\u2019s beloved metrolands</a> were cropping up. \u201cIt has a lot to do with the naming of housing estates. People obviously feel the need to pretty up these swirls of housing with dignified words such as drive and avenue.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bus drivers call it the Stiffs Estate. Hendrix, Monroe, Bob Marley: every street is named after a dead person</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the past year, there have been 201 new \u201cstreets\u201d against more than 450 drives, 560 ways and 1,000 closes. \u201cIn recent years, place names have gone from being simply a way of getting around \u2013 they\u2019ve become a brand,\u201d says <a href=\"http://people.uwe.ac.uk/Pages/person.aspx?accountname=campus%5Cr2-coates\">Dr Derek Alderman</a>, head of geography at the University of Tennessee, who has studied the history of modern place names, specifically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king\">Martin Luther King</a> streets in the US. \u201cHow does a developer market a place as worthy of moving to? They attach names that evoke images and emotions, and there is now a high priority in making those images positive.\u201d</p> <p>Many developers default to the flora and fauna of Britain, in the hope that this will conjure a rustic ideal even as our cities sprawl. In the last year alone, there have been 58 new streets with \u201cfarm\u201d in the name; there have also been 26 new Willow Streets, four different Woodpecker Closes and four Foxglove Ways, spread across Britain. There\u2019s a Willow Tree Lane in Derry, a Willow Court in Stockton-on-Tees and The Willows in north Oxford.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/03/struggle-for-the-soul-of-milton-keynes\">Milton Keynes</a> was created in 1967, its council has had to name hundreds of new roads. They take a hands-on approach, giving no leeway to developers; housebuilders are presented with a list of names they can use, and each area of the town has to fit with a designated theme.</p> <p>In Crownhill, the streets are named after musicians and film stars, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jimi-hendrix\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/marilynmonroe\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobmarley\">Bob Marley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/15/popandrock\">Billy Fury</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/freddie-mercury\">Freddie Mercury</a>. Some residents are convinced the scheme was dreamed up by someone with a morbid sense of humour: a corner of the estate backs on to the Crownhill Crematorium. \u201cThe bus drivers call it the Stiffs Estate,\u201d says Keith Evans, who works in the food industry. He has lived in Kinnear Close, named after <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0455702/\">the actor Roy</a>, since the houses were built in 1992. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence. Every street on this estate is named after a dead person.\u201d</p> <p>But the council\u2019s archivist insists the crematorium was not their inspiration. It came about, she says, after a request from the <a href=\"http://www.elvispresleyfanclub.co.uk\">British Elvis Presley fan club</a> for the singer to be immortalised on a new estate in Milton Keynes \u2013 hence Crownhill\u2019s Presley Way. Indeed, most councils have a policy that streets can\u2019t be named after living people for fear they might go on to disgrace themselves. (There are rare exceptions: Liverpool has a Ringo Starr Drive and a Paul McCartney Way; Leicester has a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/02/22/gary_lineker_road_opens_feature.shtml\">Lineker Road</a>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f040090c3ec5ca3a739fcd1816e651cdff51906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f040090c3ec5ca3a739fcd1816e651cdff51906/5058_1407_659_1008/654.jpg\" alt=\"Montage of images of houses and street signs\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018How does a developer market a place as worthy of moving to?

There are plenty who rather like it, even if they are not quite sure of the identities of all those being honoured. I meet Sarah Baitupo on the corner of Hendrix Drive and Hudson Lane, named after Hollywood star <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001369/\">Rock Hudson</a>. She moved here three years ago. \u201cI like it. It\u2019s fun,\u201d she says of the famous names. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know who Hudson is. Was he a singer? I thought it was named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jennifer-hudson\">Jennifer Hudson</a>. I\u2019d prefer it if it was Jennifer.\u201d I explain that all the people have died. She points to Keaton Close across the road, named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/busterkeaton\">Buster</a> \u2013 \u201cNot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/17/ronan-keating-q-and-a\">Ronan Keating</a>, then?\u201d \u2013 and laughs.</p> <p>Jill Brown, a finance manager and another Kinnear Close resident, isn\u2019t sure how many locals remember Roy Kinnear: \u201cBut I do think I have a bit more affinity with him because I live here. I mean, if he crops up on the telly.\u201d</p> <p>Farther down Hudson Lane, I talk to Debs Jones out walking her dog. I ask if she knows who Rock Hudson was. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to know. It creeps me out a bit, to be honest, because we live down the road from the crematorium. I always joke that that\u2019s why we are all depressed around here.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t see an alternative. \u201cI don\u2019t have much choice, do I?\u201d</p> <p>This is the problem. The parish council may be consulted by a developer or the council, but residents rarely, if ever, have a say before they move in to a new development. But there is a recent move to give some locals more input: the parents of servicemen and women killed in Afghanistan are being asked if they want to memorialise their children in a street name. <a href=\"http://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/politics/barking_and_dagenham_war_heroes_road_naming_campaign_praised_1_1949706\">An idea first talked about in Barking and Dagenham</a> in east London, many other councils have followed suit. Where roads once paid tribute to the empire\u2019s generals, now it\u2019s the turn of corporals and privates killed on active service to be remembered.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/charlie-wood-way-mums-touching-9899197\">Charlie Wood Way in Middlesbrough</a> was built 18 months ago. It is named after Wood, 34, a bomb disposal expert from 23 Pioneer Regiment who was killed in a blast from an improvised explosive device. His mother, Barbara, lives just a five-minute walk from the new estate on which her son\u2019s road sits. She says she goes past it \u201cpractically every day\u201d. Does it help? \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: Charlie Wood Way is just a sign \u2013 I\u2019d rather have him here. But I think it\u2019s a great idea, because people will remember him, and it will be there for years to come. Because one day he\u2019ll be a topic of conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Less than five miles away is <a href=\"http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/corporal-roberts-close-street-named-8603507\">Corporal Roberts Close</a>, named after Wood\u2019s friend and colleague, Andrew, known to his friends and family as Ginge; he was killed two years later. Andrew\u2019s father Stephen says he was moved that \u201cpeople have got in touch on Facebook saying how proud they are to live on Corporal Roberts Close\u201d.</p> <p>Andrew\u2019s name, along with those of all the other soldiers who died, is inscribed on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/02/national-memorial-arboretum-remembrance-dead-staffordshire\">the official memorial at the Stafford Arboretum</a>, but his father says, \u201cIt\u2019s important he\u2019s got a street named after him. It means a lot. I can see it. He\u2019s from this area, and when I see his name, I see him. I can walk by the street and remember Ginge.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Basildon, meanwhile, residents feel no such affinity with their new names. Judy Burston, 79, who, like Milinda Rydqvist, lived on Mellow Purgess, is a former teacher and very dubious about the story put out by the council that schoolchildren chose the new names. \u201cI know that very few junior schoolchildren will have heard of a gardenia, a bellflower, let alone an arabis,\u201d she scoffs. \u201cReally!\u201d</p> <p>Like her neighbours, Burston is particularly resentful about the lack of consultation, especially because the council argues that the flower scheme was decided on to ensure the streets are \u201ccoherently named and numbered for the benefit of existing and future residents\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Wright feels great sympathy with the Five Links residents. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with gardenia or wisteria,\u201d she says, \u201cbut nobody likes to be messed with. This is the local council just saying from on high: you were this, now you are that. You just don\u2019t do that. It certainly wouldn\u2019t happen in Knightsbridge. Nobody would come along to Belgrave Square in central London and say, \u2018This is now going to be Petunia Square.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m sure she\u2019s right, but is Gardenia Court, Burston\u2019s new address, really so awful? \u201cIt is a completely ridiculous name,\u201d Burston says. And what does Mellow Purgess mean to her? She answers very simply: \u201cHome.\u201d</p>",

His English is crisp and fluent; his personal odyssey from agricultural labourer to pre-eminent legal scholar verges on the fantastical.</p> <p>He was born in Beijing in 1953. During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\">cultural revolution</a> he was sent to work on a farm. \u201cI believed in communism,\u201d he recalls. After a few years, though, he began to feel he had been fooled, and started writing a novel to prove he possessed talent. When he completed it, he was allowed to return to the capital, where he worked as a plumber. There he fell in love with a beautiful young woman. \u201cShe was a doctor; it was a very good job,\u201d he says. Her parents tried to separate them.</p> <p>They set up a challenge. \u201cIf I could pass a national exam for university \u2026 they would be happy to meet me. I had had only six years of education,\u201d He recalls. \u201cThe examination was very competitive. I prepared for six months and passed.\u201d</p> <p>On enrolment at university, he randomly selected law. \u201cI didn\u2019t know [about it],\u201d he admits. \u201cUnder the cultural revolution there was no law.\u201d Two years later, after finishing his course in record time, he married his girlfriend. They have been together for 35 years, and have a daughter and a grandson.</p> <p>He is an optimist. Accustomed to hard work on the farm, he believes the experience helped him power through academic challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing for people to have hard lives and frustrations when they are young,\u201d he says. Of the cultural revolution, he is less forgiving: \u201cMy second novel [published by Penguin] is entitled <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/books/article/1628965/book-review-black-holes-he-jiahong\">Black Holes</a>. The cultural revolution was a black hole. It changed the lives of millions of people.\u201d</p> <p>The death penalty, real and fictional, has been a recurrent theme in He\u2019s work. Eventually, he hopes, its use may cease. Opinion polls conducted in 2002, he says, showed public support for executions running at around 93% of the population. It was considered a natural part of Chinese culture.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, I said that we cannot abolish the death penalty. We have to respect public opinion. If you kill somebody then you should be killed. About 10 years later, I changed my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cPublic opinion can be changed with education. More and more people think that [considering human rights] the death penalty is not a natural role for human beings.\u201d</p> <p>Around 2005, the Chinese authorities introduced a criminal justice reform known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/29/china-death-penalty-executions\">\u201ckill fewer, kill carefully\u201d</a> reforms. In 2014, an amendment to the criminal law further reduced the number of offences that carry the death penalty.</p> <p>Support for capital punishment is now around 70-80%, and coming down. He has advocated abolishing it gradually over the next two decades. \u201cIn fact, we may not abolish the death penalty [straight away],\u201d he suggests. \u201cWe might not use it. We would wait and see; if we don\u2019t use the death penalty for a number of years, then people in China would be persuaded. Then we may legally abolish the death penalty in 20 years. But it all depends on the situation \u2026 the government is facing the threat of terrorists [militant groups from within <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/china-uighurs-blamed-as-18-die-in-xinjiang-attack-says-report\">the separatist Muslim Uighur ethnic group</a>] and drug trafficking.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_China\">number of executions</a> is a state secret. Figures are disputed.

We have to change the mentality of the decision makers. These wrongful convictions made [the authorities] have second thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, the authorities decided to return to the supreme people\u2019s court the power to review any death penalty. It had previously been entrusted to lower courts because there were too many cases for the supreme court to consider. Trafficking in the organs of those who have been executed has also been banned.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, Back from the Dead could not have been published, He admits. \u201cI started studying wrongful convictions in 2005. And at the time people thought it was wrong. It was difficult to have a dialogue openly in conferences at first.</p> <p>\u201cChinese people would say: \u2018We have some dirty things, but we should not let foreigners know.\u2019 That was quite natural. But the leaders of the judiciary have had to accept that we must deal with the problem more openly, and that wrongful convictions can teach us lessons,\u201d He says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4d65fd53e48cccfda67ac5bb1526cd1ed96174f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4d65fd53e48cccfda67ac5bb1526cd1ed96174f/0_0_2048_1427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sentencing rally in the Chinese city of Wenzhou in 2004, after which 11 prisoners were executed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sentencing rally in the Chinese city of Wenzhou in 2004, after which 11 prisoners were executed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is not a matter of viewing police or prosecutors as evil gangs.

A scar on his cheek and salt-and-pepper flanks in his hair, he is in character as <a href=\"http://marvel.com/characters/14/doctor_strange\">Doctor Strange</a>, the next superhero protagonist from Marvel Studios.

Stephen Strange was a selfish young neuroscientist whose life was shattered when he suffered a car accident and lost the use of his hands. Seeking meaning in his life, Strange went on a pilgrimage to the east and found a source of magic in a Tibetan sanctuary.</p> <p>Taught by a guru named the Ancient One and coming into possession of not only his amulet \u2013 the Eye of Agamotto \u2013 but a sentient cloak, Strange returned to the west as a Sorcerer Supreme. From that point it got weirder as, not content with depicting magic, Ditko took Doctor Strange on adventures into other dimensions, creating surreal spacescapes with structures that looked like they\u2019d fallen out of a <a href=\"http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/\">Kandinsky</a> painting. Ditko\u2019s panels were vibrant, a bit bonkers, and also prescient. By the second half of the 1960s, Doctor Strange had his own title, and anyone with a keen interest in psychedelics had a new favourite superhero.</p> <p>Just like the hippies themselves, Strange has been in and out of fashion ever since. But now, in 2016, his big moment has arrived. Alongside Cumberbatch, a premier-league cast has been assembled including Swinton (as the Ancient One), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chiwetel-ejiofor\">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/12/mads-mikkelsen-lars-von-trier-hannibal-danish-cinema\">Mads Mikkelsen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jul/24/rachel-mcadams-five-best-moments\">Rachel McAdams</a>. A production crew of more than 500 have created everything from functional operating theatres to opulent Greenwich Village interiors. They have even built an entire Hong Kong street \u2013 incorporating 35 shops stocked with goods \u2013 purely for the purposes of destroying it in a fight. And, of course, there are the special effects. The film\u2019s signature scene throws Strange into a Manhattan that has folded in on itself. And not metaphorically. Viewers might reasonably expect Marvel\u2019s take on Inception or The Matrix; the phrase commonly used on set is \u201cmind-bending\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad35db68bebf415ced3aa7bde3699b44a9c5e23d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad35db68bebf415ced3aa7bde3699b44a9c5e23d/14_0_1893_1136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One with Cumberbatch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One with Cumberbatch and the inevitable Marvel portal thing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marvel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a movie business that is increasingly plagued by nightmares of multi-million pound blockbusters crashing round its ears, and after a year of critical maulings for superhero films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/08/suicide-squad-hollywood-creativity-blockbuster-films\">Suicide Squad</a>, Marvel still has a palpable swagger.

I think that Marvel is a magnet for big names because they love [the experience]. And there\u2019s a lot of things to love.\u201d</p> <p>For Derrickson, who persuaded the studios to hire him over the course of eight separate interviews, the scale of the ambition attracted him, too. \u201cI\u2019ll be shooting one scene and then doing some script revisions, and at the same time I\u2019ll be looking at VFX tests,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s never much down time, but I rather like that. Doctor Strange has long been my favourite Marvel comic book. I grew up reading them, and I do think it\u2019s the only comic that I\u2019m personally suited for because of the nature of the material. It\u2019s an aberration, and we\u2019re making a film that I think is a real left turn in the Marvel Comics Universe.\u201d</p> <p>Whether that turn will be a successful one remains to be seen, and a man with a cloak casting spells could sound a bit hokey (pocusey) for audiences. But then Chris Pratt as a modern-day Han Solo seemed a weird call until Guardians Of The Galaxy became a hit. Trailers have shown off Cumberbatch\u2019s wit as well as his kung fu skills, and you wouldn\u2019t bet against Marvel continuing the successful expansion of its \u201cuniverse\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f28367b6c5b5066d2363b6830aeb01c0c52436e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f28367b6c5b5066d2363b6830aeb01c0c52436e/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swinton with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marvel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since Iron Man rocketed on to the screen eight years ago (feels longer, right?), Marvel\u2019s ambitions have grown in sync with its success.

Doctor Strange, it is widely held, will play a key role in helping weave disparate strands of narrative together, unless people feel they haven\u2019t had enough of superheroes by then.<br></p> <p>\u201cEvolve or die,\u201d says Derrickson of the challenge ahead for Marvel. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for any major studio to fearlessly evolve. But I think Marvel don\u2019t operate out of fear at all. Marvel now has the greatest library of intellectual property there is. I think that Marvel will continue to evolve and surprise audiences in the way they want to be surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Is he right? Only time will tell.

What I actually did want to write was of course harder to say.</p> <p>As so often happens, I stumbled into it by chance. In the autumn of 2012, I wrote a 30-page story for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/15/granta-list-british-novelists\">Granta</a>. It was called \u201cEuropa\u201d and it was about a Hungarian prostitute and her male minders, one of whom is also her boyfriend, travelling to London for a week of high-end money-making. At the time I was disenchanted with the whole enterprise of writing fiction, and this simple, self-contained little tale was a way of feeling my way back to some sort of enthusiasm for it. In that respect, it certainly succeeded, because I found that by the spring of 2013 I had a definite appetite for writing more. Specifically, I had this idea of a book of stories that would speak to each other somehow, that would work together to express things that none of them would be able to express on their own. Such a book would need some kind of unifying scheme or structure.</p> <p>The first idea was that it would be a book about Europe \u2013 that each of the stories, like \u201cEuropa\u201d, would be about a person or a group of people from one European country travelling, for some reason, to another European country. It would be a book about the extreme human fluidity of contemporary Europe. (This was, remember, three and a half years ago, and the word Brexit didn\u2019t even exist \u2026) These ideas, of a Europe in motion, are of course there in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/all-that-is-man-by-david-szalay-review\"> <em>All That Man Is</em></a>, but it was quickly clear to me, as I pondered my unwritten book back in 2013, that the European theme was really just that \u2013 a theme, not a structure. It was simply not strong enough to fuse the disparate stories (only one of which had then been written) into a single, unified, indivisible work. Something more was needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95b24237621a9c06633a40f91764f402b9aa552a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95b24237621a9c06633a40f91764f402b9aa552a/557_318_5203_3122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Szalay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Szalay: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to write a conventional novel.

During my disenchantment with fiction, I had spent a while tinkering ineffectually with traditional verse forms, and one of the very worst poems I had written was a sonnet on the subject of the three ages of man. Happening to reread it one afternoon, I had one of those rare, clarifying moments that all creative artists are so grateful for \u2013 those moments when the door that you have been battering yourself against for weeks or months just swings open of its own accord. The book would be a series of stories about progressively older male protagonists \u2013 starting in adolescence and ending in retirement \u2013 and their stories would embody the massively simple and seemingly timeless notion of life as three stages: youth, maturity and old age.</p> <p>I then just wrote the stories. Initially there were seven, a nod, perhaps, to Shakespeare.

This is a massive, daunting subject, and I did not know where it would take me. However, I knew from the start that I would call it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/23/hot-milk-deborah-levy-review-novel\"><em>Hot Milk</em></a>, for the many queasy associations this title triggers. A mother and daughter would embark on a modern pilgrimage to seek a cure for a mysterious and undiagnosed illness. It would be set in an ideologically turbulent and fragile Europe \u2013 but where? In the end I decided to land my characters in a fishing village in the semi-desert of southern Spain, a landscape I know well. Over the years, I had observed how the desert is never silent and never still \u2013 the cries of small animals at night, the shrubs that vibrate with invisible insects, all of this had got under my skin.</p> <p>I wanted to use this parched, vast terrain to write about a young woman in her 20s who is ashamed of her small life and of her own despair. She would be the main carer for her mother, who perhaps (this was not set in stone) uses her various aches and pains as a means to control her daughter and keep her by her side, way after she should have left home. The theme of hypochondria offered a rich menu to explore the ways in which the body speaks for us. It\u2019s a strange language, this grammar made from mysterious symptoms that apparently defy diagnosis. It\u2019s as if the hypochondriac wants to mess up the story a physician might offer her, a bid to not be pinned down to a single narrative. Likewise, it\u2019s hard to pin down <em>Hot Milk</em> to a single storyline; there are multiple stories about the contemporary world within the main daughter-mother relationship.</p> <p>Yet, I was very taken by a deceptively simple quote from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2010/nov/05/helene-cixous-france\">H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous</a>: \u201cWe live in a history not a story.\u201d The history of the daughter in <em>Hot Milk</em>, Sofia, is that she has witnessed how her mother\u2019s wishes and hopes for herself have been lost in the winds and storms of a world that is not arranged to her advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1640b6d801d278494982dfda78af2e62e318f081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1640b6d801d278494982dfda78af2e62e318f081/889_422_3608_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Levy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Levy: \u2018I wanted to write about hypochondria.

She wants to transcend this history, to make another plot. In this quest, it was important to me to honour and give value to the more radical dimensions of human experience \u2013 the ways in which we are irrational, chaotic, superstitious, recklessly brave and hopelessly vulnerable.</p> <p><em>Hot Milk</em> is written in the first person from Sofia\u2019s point of view. The novel is her anthropological gaze on everything. To my surprise, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/neil-gaiman-top-10-mythical-characters\">Medusa myth</a> and her monstrous gaze began to tiptoe lightly through my book. <em>Hot Milk</em> puts the Medusa to work to ask Sofia a question: what is so \u201cmonstrous\u201d about a young woman, who constantly has to endure the violence of the ways in which she is societally gazed upon, returning that gaze full-on? What would it take to insert her subjectivity into the world, instead of looking away?</p> <p>\u2022 Published by Hamish Hamilton.

One story he told me will be lodged in my mind and heart forever. It involved a boy whose father had sexually abused him for years, and whose mother had been complicit in the abuse. The boy killed his father, and will live the rest of his life in prison. A year later, when I set myself the task of writing a novel, that story resurfaced in me: why do we hurt the people we love? Why is denial so powerful? Can we ever escape the identity we\u2019re born into? What does it mean to be free?</p> <p>To be honest, the answers to these questions frightened me. I was scared to confront my optimism for fear that it would be shot down with painful truths such as \u201cThere is no such thing as altruism,\u201d and \u201cViolence and trauma are basic elements of life on Earth,\u201d and \u201cThere is no escaping who I am,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll only be truly free when I\u2019m dead.\u201d That fear was the flare that lit the path to discovering my narrator, Eileen Dunlop, and ways by which she could narrate through these complex and disturbing issues.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/eileen-by-ottessa-moshfegh-review-bell-jar\"><em>Eileen</em></a> was to be my first novel, and I wanted it to appeal to a wide range of readers, from those literary types who had known me as a short-story writer, to travellers who might be browsing through the airport bookstore looking for a quick read on a flight. I decided to take a traditional novel structure and see what would arise if I followed certain narrative cues (plot points, you could say). I even bought a book called <em>The 90 Day Novel</em> to educate myself about the stylistic and structural conventions of mainstream fiction. I laughed at how simply the three-act structure of the novel was laid out, as though art could be made by plugging random variables into an algebraic formula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4d4317090996a0fbaa686a962c683b4a7e141a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4d4317090996a0fbaa686a962c683b4a7e141a1/25_117_2077_1246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ottessa Moshfegh:\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ottessa Moshfegh: \u2018Why do we hurt the people we love?

These are the questions that frightened me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Marker/BFA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw that the structure existed as a distillation of works over the past century, what we\u2019ve come to understand as \u201cclassics\u201d. The structure is very much like the three-act structure used as a template in Hollywood films. I liked the idea of a reading experience that played with a reader\u2019s canned expectations. So I took the traditional form and said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d I thought it would be an interesting creative experiment, sure, but I also knew it was the perfect architecture to house the larger question at hand: can you be free within the confines of a system? I discovered that I could not, but that limitations can sometimes lead to ingenuity.</p> <p>So I invented Eileen. She is a single woman in her early 20s in a small town in coastal New England. She works at the juvenile prison and cares for her alcoholic father, a retired cop. I chose to set the book in 1964 because America was on the precipice of a great cultural transformation at that time, and I envisioned Eileen\u2019s story as a transformation, too. I decided to make Eileen\u2019s story run in tandem with the inspiring story of the young man in prison; his was not my story to tell, but Eileen\u2019s felt very close to my own, at least emotionally. Lastly, I envisioned the book as a satire, which gave me permission to push the narrative into awkward extremes. Why did I not take a straightforward approach? When you look directly into the eyes of the beast, it attacks you. It is best to come around from the side. More is revealed to you that way.</p> <p>\u2022 Published by Vintage.

What made the case exceptional, however, was not the violence itself, but rather that Rivi\u00e8re then wrote an eloquent account of what he had done. In 1838, a Stornoway tenant farmer named Malcolm MacLeod strangled his wife Henrietta. A relative testified that he \u201chad a peculiar temper owing to some strange notions he had formed in his head\u201d; yet in a letter to his brother written from prison, MacLeod was capable of writing this: \u201cWhat can I say to you but I have a low eye and a trembling heart and a low hope that the Lord have mercy on me, a poor cursed man.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of an individual capable of an act of terrible violence yet also able to write articulately about what they have done fascinates me, and was the initial spur for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/12/his-bloody-project-by-graeme-macrae-burnet-review\"><em>His Bloody Project</em></a>. My research led me to the concept originating in 19th-century criminal psychology of \u201cmania without delirium\u201d or \u201cmoral insanity\u201d, a condition whereby an individual might be seized by \u201cparoxysms of maniacal fury\u201d, yet at all other times appear to be fully in possession of their reason. My protagonist, Roddy Macrae, a 17-year-old crofter who kills three people in the tiny village of Culduie in 1869, began to form in my mind.</p> <p>It was quite natural for me to set my story in the barren but stunning landscapes of Wester Ross. My mother\u2019s side of the family comes from there and I have been visiting the area all my life. The Scottish Highlands, however, is not the rural idyll imagined by the Victorians. It has a dark history of clan warfare and later of the brutal \u201cclearances\u201d, when crofters were forced off the land to make way for the more profitable ventures of sheep farming and gaming estates. An inventory of 25 regulations governing the lives of crofters in Lewis in 1881 brought home to me the draconian nature of the regimes under which the native population lived. The cropping of heather from the hills, taking fish from the burns, harvesting shellfish or even seaweed from the shore: all were outlawed. Thus, the feudal conditions under which Roddy Macrae lives form a backdrop to his crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a361038bdaa7214a96e4ab2324cae079de62d3e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a361038bdaa7214a96e4ab2324cae079de62d3e1/769_53_4217_2530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Macrae Burnet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graeme Macrae Burnet: \u2018I was fascinated by the idea of an individual capable of terrible violence, and also writing articulately about it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But historical research and abstract ideas alone will not bring a novel to life.

  "<p>Last month, 180 delegates from twenty African countries spent three days in Pretoria, South Africa debating how evidence can be more widely used in decision making. The emphasis of the <a href=\"http://www.evidenceconference.org.za/\">Evidence 2016 meeting</a> was on shared learning across the continent, in support of Africa\u2019s development goals. Participants came from a diverse range of fields, including scientific advice, evidence-based medicine, policy evaluation and financial planning.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naledi_Pandor\">Naledi Pandor</a>, South Africa\u2019s minister for science and technology, opened the conference with <a href=\"http://www.gov.za/speeches/minister-naledi-pandor-africa-evidence-network-conference-2016-20-sep-2016-0000\">a call for more decisions to be informed by evidence</a>, tempered by a reminder that social and political factors must also play a role. Her <a href=\"http://www.gov.za/speeches/minister-naledi-pandor-africa-evidence-network-conference-2016-20-sep-2016-0000\">keynote speech</a> reflects the prominence that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/guardian-africa-network\">growing number of African governments</a> are placing on the use of evidence.</p> <p>The meeting was hosted by the <a href=\"http://www.africaevidencenetwork.org/\">Africa Evidence Network (AEN)</a>, a \u2018made in Africa\u2019 initiative that brings together public servants, researchers and civil society representatives who share an interest in evidence-informed decision-making across the public sector. The network came about when twenty Africans found themselves at a conference in Asia, and decided to build a stronger community of practice in their own continent. Three years on, that core group has expanded into a network of nearly 1000 people across thirty-five countries. More than a quarter of its members are drawn from African governments.</p> <p>As a result, there is now a growing community in practice in Africa focused on the use of evidence to support development agendas. Given the limited resources of many African governments, it is important that policies and programmes have the desired effect. Better use of research, data, evaluation and citizen views can make a real difference.</p> <p>The delegates at <a href=\"http://www.evidenceconference.org.za/\">Evidence 2016</a> shared experiences of the use of evidence by legislators and policymakers in their countries. \u201cJust yesterday I learnt about what is happening in my own Parliament towards evidence-informed decision-making\u201d, commented one academic from Uganda. Information sharing was a key theme of the conference, as was the need to build relationships based on trust and mutual respect, to understand political realities, and to recognise how values underpin how evidence gets used in decision-making.</p> <p>\u201cWe also give a voice to the African community on the global stage\u201d explains <a href=\"http://www.africaevidencenetwork.org/author/precious/page/2/\">Precious Motha</a>, the AEN\u2019s coordinator. Network members have attended other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/sep/28/scientists-are-giving-advice-but-are-governments-listening\">recent meetings on evidence and policy</a> in Rome, London, Brussels and Maastricht. All too often, Africa is an agenda item at such international meetings, but as Motha explains, \u201cwe want to be at the table contributing to decisions, not only the subject being discussed.\u201d</p> <p>And the <a href=\"http://www.africaevidencenetwork.org/\">network</a> plans to keep on growing. Challenges remain in engaging francophone countries, and tapping into the full range of individuals and communities who can bring expertise and insights to decision-making across Africa.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.gov.za/speeches/minister-naledi-pandor-africa-evidence-network-conference-2016-20-sep-2016-0000\">Naledi Pandor reminded us in her opening speech</a>, the greatest potential lies in using evidence to inform how Africa tackles its three big challenges: unemployment, inequality and poverty. None of these has simple solutions, and they all require extensive collaboration between the public and private sectors, civil society and academia. The <a href=\"http://www.africaevidencenetwork.org/\">Africa Evidence Network</a> is bringing people together who care deeply about these issues, and have the power, willingness and energy to tackle them head-on. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuthS3\">Ruth Stewart</a> is programme director, of UJ-BCURE (Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence) at the University of Johannesburg, and chair of the executive committee of the Africa Evidence Network.

Beer thoughts may start with Beamish and Murphy\u2019s but craft breweries, such as award-winner Rising Sons, as well as Elbow Lane, the Franciscan Well, and the Cotton Ball Brewing Co, provide character in a pub scene that is alive, well and adhering to cliches \u2013 in the best possible sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"314351f16a965a4f1d352b5ba37b09ed698eb76c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/314351f16a965a4f1d352b5ba37b09ed698eb76c/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Finbarr\u2019s Cathedral in Bishop Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saint Fin Barre\u2019s cathedral in Bishop Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, it has its historic attractions. Enjoy city views and ring the Shandon Bells at <strong>St Anne\u2019s church</strong> (adults \u20ac5, children \u20ac2.50), marvel at the William Burges-designed <a href=\"http://corkcathedral.webs.com/\"><strong>Saint Fin Barre\u2019s cathedral</strong></a> (\u20ac5), chinstroke at <a href=\"http://www.crawfordartgallery.ie/\">the <strong>Crawford art gallery</strong> </a>(free) \u2013 or visit <a href=\"http://www.corkbutter.museum/\"><strong>Cork Butter museum</strong></a> (adult \u20ac4, child \u20ac1.50). But this student-rich city also has a sense of fun and a strong cultural heartbeat away from its tourist hits.</p> <p>Cork hosts 24 major festivals every year, including Ireland\u2019s oldest movie showcase, <a href=\"http://www.corkfilmfest.org/\"><strong>the Cork film festival</strong></a>, which celebrates its 61st birthday in November. There\u2019s also a world-renowned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/20/top-10-jazz-festivals-europe-montreux-umbria-cork\">jazz festival</a> in October and annual celebrations of folk music, literature, science and food. What\u2019s more, this is a place built for strolling and has a centre ripe for exploring. It has its dark side, too \u2026 though you can more easily examine that amid the, at times, comic setting of Lisa McInerney\u2019s prize-winning novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-glorious-heresies.html\">The Glorious Heresies</a>.</p> <p>Cork may often have been merely a starting point for those heading west to the rugged, dramatic scenery of the Ring of Kerry, Mizen Head and the Ring of Beara but it is a fascinating jaunt in its own right. The verbal jousting with Dublin about being the \u201creal\u201d capital of Ireland is unlikely to end but pick any month and there\u2019ll be a great event here; pick the right time and an affordable return flight is likely. Cork could be the short-hop stop that turns into the best of adventures.</p> <h2><strong>WHAT TO SEE AND DO</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2159a916f50a4982fb50509907dfc06a6f022077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2159a916f50a4982fb50509907dfc06a6f022077/0_771_4712_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Glucksman Gallery, University College, Cork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Glucksman Gallery, University College, Cork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Get on the Fab Food Trail</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s not fast food but fab food.

The Cork <strong>film festival</strong> (11-20 November) mixes home-grown movies, a well-curated pick from world cinema, plus a few Hollywood big hitters. It makes use of venues around the city, including the impressive Opera House. <a href=\"http://www.corkfilmfest.org/2016/\">This year, the festival</a> features director Nate Parker\u2019s provocative The Birth of a Nation; Gimme Danger, Jim Jarmusch\u2019s documentary about punk band the Stooges; a strand of German films; and a series of late-night screenings including a 40th anniversary presentation of Carrie.

  "<h2>What should I do if my employer won\u2019t provide a reference for a new job?</h2> <p><strong>\u2022 How can I get a reference from an employer who just won\u2019t provide one? I am studying, and looking forward to getting back into work once I finish the course. I\u2019m three months away from completing my course and have had interviews. I have emailed my previous boss to provide references, but received no answer after seven days.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>I admit we never got on, but I complied with all work expectations and took full responsibility for everything I did. Neither was I late or absent without permission or with a wrong attitude.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>What should I do when faced with a prospective employer looking for references from my previous employer? </strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 I am trying to get a second reference from previous employers. One has got back to me saying they only keep records for six years and I worked in this job in 2005; the other I\u2019m waiting on is for an employer from 1998-2005.</strong></p> <p><strong>If I can\u2019t get these references what are the alternatives? It might cost me my new job.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Since both letters are on similar subjects, I will answer them jointly.</p> <p>The reluctance of past employers to provide references to past employees seems to be becoming more common. This is mainly because employers are not obliged to provide references (unless specifically included in the original employment contract or in certain regulated occupations such as financial services); there is no advantage to the ex-employer in providing such a reference; and a growing fear of litigation for having provided a misleading reference makes companies wary of saying anything at all.</p> <p>When such a refusal incurs no penalty, and when the provision potentially opens them up to legal action, it\u2019s easy to see why companies choose to do nothing. And there\u2019s very little the former employee, whose potential new employer is understandably demanding references, can do about it.</p> <p>In the case above where 10 years or more have passed since the employee last worked for those two companies, their failure to provide references or respond to requests doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Since employers can\u2019t be forced to provide references, the frustrated employee has to think of alternatives.</p> <p>In both cases, personal references can&#xa0;help fill the gap, and can certainly provide reassurance on questions of character \u2013 the more authoritative the referee, of course, the better. Ex-teachers or university tutors are often happy to oblige. It\u2019s also worth thinking of senior people who have left the company you used to work for, but with whom you had a good relationship. Their endorsements can\u2019t, of course, be official and shouldn\u2019t pretend to be \u2013 but&#xa0;by assembling quite a number of such \u201cunofficial\u201d references you can provide substantial comfort to the recruiting company.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I couldn\u2019t get a reference due to the company ceasing trading, but I got a statement of employment dates from the pension scheme they moved funds into when the company scheme closed. I then had a reference from volunteering and a personal reference. <strong>ajchm</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Just provide potential employers with contact details when asked for a reference and hope for the best. Besides, it\u2019s not unusual for references not to be followed up. <strong>walkinginthesand</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s the duty of the new employer to contact the old one to confirm any information, quite often through a background check company who will go through your CV to check all your claims. <strong>whatamilike</strong></p> <p><strong> \u2022 </strong>Ask the HR department at your previous company instead. They will normally just give confirmation that you worked there and the start and end dates.<strong> Vinnyr</strong></p> <h2>My daughter\u2019s probation service job has put her in a false and difficult position</h2> <p><strong>My daughter works for the probation service.

When she complained that she felt uncomfortable that she was not regarded as a bona-fide employee, her manager said she was there \u201cto break down discrimination\u201d.&#xa0;But my daughter is not a \u201cservice user\u201d and has therefore been placed in a false position.</strong></p> <p><strong>After doing three weeks\u2019 training she has been placed in the local office, where she is given literally nothing to do. She\u2019s been told she cannot offer to help other staff in any way, as that is not her job. When she tried to help a colleague with a new computer protocol that my daughter was familiar with, she was reprimanded. Her manager has simply said she should \u201cresearch training opportunities on the internet\u201d. </strong></p> <p><strong>She desperately wants to leave, which is a shame as she entered the probation service with a keen desire to work with clients. Her position is further weakened by the fact her new role is only a short contract, whereas her previous role (taken before the probation service was privatised) was a permanent contract.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>As I am sure you are aware, the part-privatisation of the probation service has not been without its critics, and the National Audit Office, among others, has raised a number of concerns. It seems as if your daughter is the helpless victim of a lengthy process of organisational change that has yet to be completed.</p> <p>However, it can\u2019t be in her company\u2019s interests that this bizarre situation is allowed to continue. I can quite understand her disillusionment and wanting to get out \u2013 but she has a vocational drive to help rehabilitate clients and I can think of no obvious alternative jobs to which she could turn.</p> <p>So I believe you should encourage her to hang on in there for a little while yet. A privatised company, conscious of the need at the very least to cover its costs, is surely not going to go on paying someone to do nothing for much longer.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your daughter believed she had been offered a full-time role supporting probation service users. This sounded like a good step up from being a part-time receptionist, so she accepted. Once in post it seems as if she has been mistaken for a service user herself. There must be emails and paperwork \u2013 not least an offer of employment \u2013 which can clarify what exactly was offered to her. <strong>Theresa Thomson</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your daughter should take a long and hard look at her files in the HR department and find out how she became a \u201cprobation service user\u201d. Her manager, by the sound of it, may not be aware that she is not. Also, you should seek legal advice. Obviously your daughter would be better off in another working environment, but I cannot see how a reference showing that she was employed as a probation service user could do her any good. <strong>Aranzazu</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

  "<p>The old-style model of publishing was: you wrote your book; you got an agent; your agent got you a publishing deal; you got published. Then the hard work began \u2013 getting noticed, getting reviews, sales, awards, bestseller lists, film deals. Finally, you relaxed on your yacht off Cap d\u2019Antibes. Of course, very few writers made it to the end of that sequence.</p> <p>The world has changed. Nowadays publishing is simultaneously easier and much, much harder. Easier because anybody can e-publish their book and present it to a global market with a couple of mouse-clicks. And, boy, are people presenting their works, uncountable rivers of e-books flowing over the cliff-face of the internet. Which is why it\u2019s harder too, of course: with so much \u201ccontent\u201d out there, how is anyone to attract readers? Some manage it. Andy Weir initially published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/science-fiction-roundup-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Martian</em></a> on his own website because nobody else was interested, and then watched it become first a global bestseller (quickly snapped up by a conventional publisher) and then an Oscar-nominated movie. But who else can pull off such a trick?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/31/science-fiction-roundup\">The best recent science fiction novels \u2013 review roundup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Becky Chambers, maybe. I was one of the judges for the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.thekitschies.com/\" title=\"\">Kitschies</a>, an&#xa0;award that allows the submission of&#xa0;self-published work alongside conventionally published material. And a huge amount of self-published stuff was duly submitted, the majority of it e-published and the majority of that \u2026 well, \u201ccrap\u201d, I think, would be the mot juste.</p> <p>But every now and again a diamond would shine from the dustheap. Chambers\u2019s first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/31/science-fiction-roundup\" title=\"\"><em>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</em></a>, was one such: a genuinely charming space opera, character-driven science fiction that was readable and inventive and heartening, somewhere between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/27/firefly-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\"><em>Firefly</em></a> and Larry Niven, with just a dash of <em>Treasure Island</em>. <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beckychambers/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet\" title=\"\">Chambers had used Kickstarter</a> to raise the (modest) sum she needed to write and self-publish her novel. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/13/self-published-sci-fi-debut-kickstarts-on-to-kitschies-shortlist\" title=\"\">shortlisted it for the Kitschies</a>, and you\u2019ll pardon me for smiling smugly if I note that it went on to be listed for the Clarke award, the British Fantasy award, the Tiptree and the Baileys women\u2019s prize for fiction. It&#xa0;was also picked up by a major publisher and has won her a&#xa0;large body&#xa0;of fans.</p> <p>In a contrast to the low-key birth of her first book, Hodder is giving her follow-up the all-bells-and-whistles treatment. It\u2019s well earned. Though it works as a standalone story, <em>A Closed and Common Orbit</em> is an overlapping sequel to <em>Small Angry Planet</em> which includes many of the same things that made the first book such a success: a believably grimy hi-tech world, complex characters, varied alien species, and above all the sheer likability of the&#xa0;whole. It has the same weaknesses, too: a tendency for characters to pootle about rather than move the larger plot forward, and a slight sense of authorial thumb-in-the-balance when it comes to stressing the upsides, never the downsides, of cultural, sexual and inter-species diversity.</p> <p>In essence it is a story about the strength of the love that can grow between friends. Pepper is a streetwise mechanic, tech-mender and space-pilot; her ghastly childhood as \u201cJane 23\u201d in a scrap-recycling sweatshop run&#xa0;by robots is roughly half the novel. And then there\u2019s Lovelace, an artificial intelligence running a large spaceship, with myriad data pathways and surveillance networks, who has to go on the run, downloaded into the poky sensorium of a humanoid robot body called Sidra. Chambers is particularly deft when it comes to getting the reader inside Sidra\u2019s new consciousness: from initial panicky claustrophobia through a convincing and moving process of self-discovery and awareness. The novel is compelling in its portrait of Pepper coming to terms with her past, but the real star of the show is Lovelace.</p> <p>One thing SF is especially good at doing is representing people who are \u201con the spectrum\u201d, from Asperger\u2019s to autism. Mainstream fiction also includes these characters, of course; but SF has a knack for doing it in a way that is humanising and eloquent. This may be because many people on this spectrum are more comfortable with the hard facts and cut-and-driedness of science and technology. Either way, characters such as <em>Star Trek</em>\u2019s Spock or&#xa0;Data are talismanic figures for many such fans. There\u2019s a reason <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>\u2019s Sheldon Cooper is such an SF geek.</p> <p>In the character of Sidra, Chambers has created a memorable addition to this gallery: a rational computer intellect who grows wonderfully into her emotional life. Warm, engaging, properly science-fictional, <em>A Closed and Common Orbit</em> is a very likable novel&#xa0;indeed.</p> <p>Adam Roberts\u2019s<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-thing-itself.html\" title=\"\"> <em>The Thing Itself</em></a> is published by Gollancz.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>A Closed and Common Orbit</em>&#xa0;is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

  "<p>The overnight low in West Kirby on the Wirrall was around 5C last night. Yet in Colin Usher\u2019s home the temperature is a comfy 20c-21C \u2013 despite the fact he has not turned on the heating once this autumn. Even in the depths of winter, the house uses a fraction of the energy that most British homes consume trying to keep warm. On average, the Ushers\u2019 home energy bills since 2014 have been \u00a3530 a year, and that for a house that is nearly twice the size of a standard British semi. It means the family is saving at least \u00a31,000 a year, and possibly much more. Throw in the fact that their rooftop solar panels generate an income of \u00a3500 a year and their net energy bills are actually close to zero.</p> <p>Colin and his wife Jenny insist they are not shivering in their four-bed house, or wrapped in multiple fleeces and blankets to keep the cold away. Rarely does the temperature in the house go above 22c, rarely does it fall below 20c. Yet they have achieved this without spending ludicrous amounts of money buying the fanciest new technology. Usher, an architect, built the 179 sq metre (1,926 sq ft) house for just \u00a3240,000 and says the key to saving on heating bills is being airtight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d2dd0856d3ef4673a7a57bead275793620add815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2dd0856d3ef4673a7a57bead275793620add815/0_38_670_837/400.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Usher's eco home\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A warm welcome: it may be chilly outside, but inside Colin and Jenny Usher\u2019s home it\u2019s a steady 20C \u2013 without having to turn on the heating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have lots of insulation, of course. The house is almost completely airtight. But because it is hermetically sealed we also need to carefully ventilate it. Above all, we spent money on good quality construction \u2013 it is a heavyweight construction using lots of concrete, a material that helps to iron out hot and cold weather. It heats up from the sun, and holds the heat for days.\u201d</p> <p>Usher did not even bother to install any heating upstairs in the house and, after three winters in their home, they haven\u2019t needed it. \u201cThe way it works is that the whole building holds heat \u2013 it\u2019s like a night storage heater. The ventilation system then distributes the temperature around the house.\u201d</p> <p>One innovation of Usher\u2019s is to have an over-large water cyclinder, which holds lots of warm to hot water, rather than very hot water. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to overheat water. We never add cold water to the shower or when running a bath. It is very wasteful to overheat water.\u201d</p> <p>But while Usher is a fan of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/standard.jsp?id=122\" title=\"http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/standard.jsp?id=122\">Passivhaus</a>\u201d eco-standards for building, he is critical of some in the insulation industry. \u201cI have a jaundiced view of installing insulation without warning about the condensation risks. People go to great efforts to put in insulation, then get condensation and mildew in the corner of their rooms. It\u2019s almost bound to happen.\u201d He recommends that anyone making their home airtight should also consider systems such as the <a href=\"http://www.nuaire.co.uk/our-products/Residential/products?pt=1685\" title=\"\">Nuaire Drimaster</a>, which costs around \u00a3250 and gently forces moist air out of the house.</p> <p>Some will say that new-builds with lots of energy-saving measures are great, but ask what is realistic for an existing house, especially the Victorian or Edwardian terraces common in UK cities?</p> <p>Luigi and Jane Caccavale took a 120-year-old, three-floor, rundown property in Wandsworth, south London, and brought it up to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/page.jsp?id=20\" title=\"http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/page.jsp?id=20\">EnerPHit</a>\u201d standards that aim to match the energy efficiency of a new-build eco-home. Today their energy bills are around \u00a380 a month, although keeping the home comfortable was as important as saving money. Like the Ushers, airtightness has been key to saving energy, as has triple-glazing the house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People go to great efforts to put in insulation, then get condensation and mildew. It\u2019s almost bound to happen</p> <footer> <cite>Colin Usher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about keeping the heat in,\u201d says Luigi, a software engineer who managed much of the project himself. It involved stripping the house back to its brickwork, and then leaving enough of a gap between the bricks and the insulation to let air circulate. \u201cIn effect, condensation forms outside the envelope of the house rather than inside it,\u201d he says. But he warns owners of older houses that making it airtight was something of a slog. \u201cWhen you try to make an old house airtight, you have to go through every crack and seam. It\u2019s very labour-intensive.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Fulham, south-west London, Pablo Ettinger says his electricity bills are already down 40% since he carried out a full energy survey on his house earlier this year and had works completed in July. He\u2019s hoping that his heating bills will be down by a similar amount. \u201cThey insulated my roof and some walls, and a very large number of windows and doors were replaced with triple-glazed windows. In addition they converted all my bulbs to LEDs.\u201d</p> <p>He admits the cost was high \u2013 but it\u2019s a big house in an expensive area \u2013 and that the work was done to make the house quieter and more comfortable as much as to save money. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic large Victorian house, four beds, a cellar, very badly built around 1895 with almost zero insulation. Our heating bills were around \u00a32,000 a year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa3b864da8a53acbdb0bde771457276b6fc40db3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa3b864da8a53acbdb0bde771457276b6fc40db3/7_0_1213_942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luigi and Jane Caccavale\u2019s eco-home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"777\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For Luigi and Jane Caccavale it\u2019s all about keeping the heat in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joana Saramago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s now a huge convert to triple-glazing. \u201cWe\u2019d had double-glazing done, but it was a complete waste of money. Triple-glazing is twice the price of double-glazing but makes a huge difference. The house now feels totally, totally sealed. We\u2019re about five yards away from the District Line at the back of the house but now you can hardly hear it.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing with us was that it wasn\u2019t really about saving money, but about making the house comfortable. The top of the house used to feel cold even at the height of summer. It just feels so much more comfortable now.\u201d</p> <p>Ettinger looked into turning his home into a zero-energy house, but after visiting various projects he decided against it. \u201cI\u2019m a musician, and standing in a zero-energy room feels like standing in a dead space \u2013 you really can almost feel it. So we decided not to go the whole hog.\u201d</p> <p>Akta Raja, founder of <a href=\"http://www.enhabit.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Enhabit UK</a>, which designs and delivers low-energy improvements to buildings, and who helped the Caccavales to retro-fit their home, says her drive is about protecting the environment as much as saving money. Around a fifth of carbon emissions in Britain come from buildings, which could be cut dramatically if we moved to low energy standards. She also reckons that we could drive home energy bills down to as little as \u00a3350 a year with careful planning and building. \u201cThere are also the other benefits: homes that are quieter and more comfortable, warmer in winter and cooler in summer.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you try to make an old house airtight, you have to go through every crack and seam</p> <footer> <cite>Luigi Caccavale</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Raja acknowledges that some energy-saving measures can be expensive, only delivering a financial return over the long term. But she adds that there are quick wins: chimney balloons, which cost as little as \u00a320, \u201cmake a massive difference to comfort and to bills,\u201d she says. Manufacturers estimate that a chimney balloon can save half a tonne of CO2 a year per chimney and pay for themselves within three months.</p> <p>So should we tackle the major housebuilding firms for failing to ensure our homes are not more airtight and energy saving? Enhabit UK\u2019s board includes a former chief executive of Barratt. \u201cCurrent building regulations in the UK are actually quite good, and newly built houses should be relatively cheap to run and be comfortable. But above this it needs attention to detail \u2013 so we see some houses where airtightness levels are lower than they should be.\u201d</p> <p>At the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in Watford, meanwhile, a \u201czero bills\u201d home aims to make home energy bills obsolete. The rooftop solar panels generate electricity, while a small air source heat pump recycles heat recovered from stale air. The house is an off-the-shelf kit made of a steel frame with timber wall panels that its makers, <a href=\"http://www.zedfactory.com/\" title=\"\">ZEDfactory</a>, say costs \u00a31,350 per square meter, or around \u00a3129,600 to build a standard three-bed home. It has already been commissioned for use on a development in Newport, Essex.</p> <p>The public can visit the BRE Innovation Park at Watford and view the zero-energy home.

The Energy Saving Trusts suggests getting a \u201cstandby saver\u201d which allows you to turn all your appliances off standby in one go.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Save \u00a350 a year in the kitchen</strong> Use a bowl to wash up rather than a running tap and cut energy bills by \u00a330 a year. Only fill the kettle with the amount of water you need and save around \u00a37 a year. Cutback your washing machine use by just one cycle per week and save \u00a35 a year on energy, and a further \u00a38 a year on metered water bills.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Spend less time in the shower</strong> One minute less in the shower each day will save around \u00a310 each year per person. With a water meter this could save a further \u00a310 off annual water and sewage bills. If everyone in a four person family did this it would lead to a total saving of \u00a380 a year.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Install an energy saving monitor</strong> Nothing shows you how much power you are using more than a domestic monitor \u2013 you will get one for free when you install a smart meter, or you can buy them for around \u00a325. You soon find out exactly where your cash is going on energy costs.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Low energy LED lightbulbs </strong>New LED spotlights are bright enough to replace halogens, as well as regular energy saving bulbs. If the average household replaced old-fashioned bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps, and all of their halogens with LEDs, it would cost about \u00a3100 and save about \u00a335 a year.</p>",

  "<h2>Snapshot: Me as a teen, through my big sister\u2019s eyes <br></h2> <p>These are two photos of me, both taken by my older sister, Xtine. The colour picture (above) is from the summer of 1962, when I was 14. At that time I was mad about Cliff Richard\u2019s backing group, the Shadows. About six months earlier, I had been given their first LP. On the cover was a colour photo of the group in a casual pose. Hank Marvin and Jet Harris are looking at what appears to be a fan letter. Bruce Welch is looking straight at the camera, but Tony Meehan, the drummer, seems lost in his own thoughts. They are all wearing very distinctive, striped jumpers or cardigans. As Meehan was the drummer, and I played drums in a&#xa0;school rock group, he was my idol.</p> <p>I begged my mother to knit me a zip-up cardigan, as close in pattern and colour to the one Meehan is wearing on the album cover. She did an amazing job, as always, and that\u2019s what I am sporting in the photo.</p> <p>Xtine is seven years older than me. In 1962, she was 21 and already a schoolteacher. Over the next two or three years, she and her new boyfriend had a big influence on my taste in music and clothes and my hairstyle. You can see evidence of that in the second photo (below), which was taken in 1964, the year of Twist and Shout and It\u2019s All Over Now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"225ec77e42531e858049ca706ce6a4771230eebf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225ec77e42531e858049ca706ce6a4771230eebf/0_0_1063_1068/995.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Tinwell\u2019s sister\u2019s \u2018arty\u2019 shot of him, taken in 1964.\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Tinwell\u2019s sister\u2019s \u2018arty\u2019 shot of him, taken in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gone is the Shadows-style cardigan, replaced by a black turtleneck jumper and long black scarf (knitted by my mother). Gone are the ice-blue Wranglers, replaced by Levi\u2019s. Gone is the old-fashioned hairstyle, replaced (although you can\u2019t really see it in the photo) by a Beatles-influenced style. It was my sister who persuaded me \u2013 and at first it took a lot of persuasion \u2013 to have a Beatles fringe and let it grow longer.</p> <p>But gradually I embraced it and was the only boy at my school with \u201clong\u201d hair. I was often rebuked by teachers for my \u201cBeatle cut\u201d including, once, the headmaster during morning assembly. As it turned out, I became more of a Rolling Stones fan.</p> <p><em>Ian Tinwell </em></p> <h2>Playlist: Cassette tapes and trips to Folkestone</h2> <p><strong>Ghost Town by the Specials</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>This town is coming like a ghost town / All the clubs have been closed down / This place&#xa0; is coming like a ghost town / Bands won\u2019t play no more / Too much fighting on the dance floo</em>r\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ2oXzrnti4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZ2oXzrnti4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ghost Town by the Specials topped the&#xa0;British charts in the summer of 1981, spending three weeks at No 1.

I stood back and watched as the beautiful, clear, orange-red liquid was poured into the jars.&#xa0;Water vapour rose&#xa0;in clouds into the already humid room.

  "<p><em>Rosalind Powell, with her husband, Harry, adopted 14-year-old Gabriel when he was two*.</em></p> <p><strong>1. Know your limits.</strong> Embarking on the adoption process is exciting, scary, intense and emotional. Most of the children up for adoption have been taken away from their birth parents and come through the care system, having possibly experienced abuse or neglect. You will hear stories that make you cry, and some children will capture your heart. Be honest with yourself \u2013 work out what you feel you can offer as parents in terms of a child\u2019s age, sibling groups or any difficulties they may have, and how you will fit as a family.</p> <p><strong>2. What\u2019s love got to do with it?</strong> There are two fundamental questions at the heart of adoption \u2013 can you love somebody else\u2019s child and can they love you? With hindsight, I know both are possible. But there is no way of knowing this when you adopt. All you can do is hope: it\u2019s a leap of faith that co-exists with fear. I felt totally committed to Gabriel when he arrived, and protective of him, but did I love him? I didn\u2019t know him. I knew I had to wait for love to come, and it did.</p> <p><strong>3. Keep things familiar.</strong> When Gabriel arrived, I was desperate to dress him how I wanted him to look. But even a new brand of washing powder can be overwhelming for a young child moving into a strange environment and having to get used to unfamiliar smells, textures, colours and sounds. However strong the urge to change them, keep toys, clothes and bed linen the same until they settle.</p> <p><strong>4. You don\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb.</strong> All new parents feel conspicuous \u2013 and adoptive parents do with knobs on. You have been brought together as strangers and yet you are now a family. Your child is likely to be a walking, talking, bombastic toddler. They may be older. You haven\u2019t had the luxury of getting to know them from birth, nurture them through the first smile, steps or tooth. Instead, you\u2019ve been catapulted straight into the battlefield of swing parks and play groups \u2013 even the school playground.</p> <p>If they have a tantrum in public, at best, you feel that everyone is pointing at you and, at worst, that your child is going to be carted off by social services. For many months, I felt a fraud, in charge of a stolen child. I would make excuses to strangers, blurting out to shopkeepers, bus drivers and fellow mums, \u201cHe\u2019s adopted!\u201d It didn\u2019t help that for the first six weeks he called us both Harry. It\u2019s a terrifically steep learning curve but as you all get to know each other better, things will fall into place.</p> <p><strong>5. Who is the mummy/daddy?</strong> I felt I didn\u2019t just have to learn how to become a mother, I also had to earn the right to be one \u2013 a common feeling among adoptive parents. But you have been better prepared than most to become parents, having been through a rigorous assessment process in which you have had to confront your motives for wanting a family, and assess how good you\u2019ll be at it. As for the thorny issue of whether you\u2019re the \u201creal\u201d mum or dad \u2013 you have fed, washed and clothed your child, dried their tears, read to them and loved them. You can\u2019t get more real than that.</p> <p><strong>6. Nosey parkers.</strong> Be prepared for awkward questions from strangers, insensitive acquaintances and inquisitive children. My husband and I are white, our son is mixed-heritage, which has led to intrusive remarks, including, \u201cWhat blood\u2019s he got in him?\u201d Work out how much information you want to give about your family and be ready with the answers. It is helpful to remind yourself that your child\u2019s personal history is their story to tell, not yours.</p> <p><strong>7. Talk.</strong> Be open with your child about their adoption from the start. Talk to them about it, respond to questions and add bits of information as and when appropriate. Take your lead from them. The Life Story book \u2013 the collation of photos and facts compiled by your child\u2019s social worker about their life before coming to you \u2013 can be a useful tool for you to explain and them to understand events so far. If you are not happy with what has been provided, make your own. We did.</p> <p><strong>8. Be a team.</strong> As with any parents, a bit of competitive parenting does creep in. Both of you are trying to bond with this little person, and win their love. I was surprised to discover my inner earth mother a few months after Gabriel\u2019s arrival, determined to be nurturer in chief. I wanted Harry to play the \u201chunter gatherer\u201d and kick a ball around. He wanted to be able to give his son a bath occasionally. We eventually compromised and found our rhythm, but it took time.</p> <p><strong>9. Enjoy it \u2013 time passes so quickly.</strong> The first few years are a whirlwind of new experiences and heightened emotions, so overwhelming at times that you forget to enjoy it. My son is now 14 so no longer needs me to push him in a buggy to send him to sleep; read him bedtime stories; listen to endless requests for Ben 10s, or tell him to brush his teeth (actually, he still does). I love having a teenager who is taller than me, but I wish I could have just one day again with him at two, and know what I know now \u2013 that it will all be fine.</p> <p><em>*Not their real names.</em></p> <p><em>Rosalind Powell\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-i-met-my-son.html\"><em>How I Met My Son: A Journey Through Adoption</em></a><em> is published by Blink, \u00a38.99.</em></p>",

This development in my opinion should never have been built without an environmental assessment, much less allowed to operate. This case was important because of the unique environmental values of the Tiwi Islands, but it sends a broader message to government and those wanting to develop the north \u2013 don\u2019t cut corners and don\u2019t think you can get away with more here than you can in other parts of Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Drew English, convenor of the Environment Centre NT, said he hoped Frydenberg would push for a full environmental impact survey. </p> <p>\u201cThe orders today make it clear that what was done was inadequate, and the Northern Territory community, and our environment, expect and deserve better,\u201d English said. </p> <p>\u201cThese islands, like much of the Northern Territory, are important habitat for many species. They remain that way because the NT has avoided much of the damaging approach to development that has occurred down south.
