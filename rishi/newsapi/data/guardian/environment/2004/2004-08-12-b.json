  "<p>In case anybody needed a reminder of the filthy lucre on offer in the world of hedge funds, up popped Jupiter Asset Management's annual report yesterday to reveal that Philip Gibbs took home \u00a38.2m last year. </p> <p>Good luck to him, many will say. A few years ago, he was a humble banking analyst at BZW, he took a risk with his career and is clearly good at his job. Jupiter, the company, may still be loss-making but the bits for which Mr Gibbs has responsibility, including the Hyde Park hedge fund, are showing excellent investment returns. </p> <p>Yet something jars about the size of these sums. A successful chief executive of a large FTSE 100 company, whose decisions directly affect the lives of tens of thousands of employees, does well to collect more than two or three million in a year. Betting on the success or failure of those decisions can clearly be far more rewarding. </p> <p>Naturally, every self-confident financial expert wants to try his hand. A fascinating piece of research by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein yesterday calculated that there were 6,000 hedge funds at the end of 2003, managing $850bn of funds. Ten years before the figures were 1,500 and about $200bn; Dresdner's analysts call it \"near exponential growth.\" </p> <p>Their concern is not individual managers' rewards, but the bubble-like nature of this new industry. Growth was fuelled by poor returns in traditional equities and cheap money as Fed chairman Alan Greenspan cut interest rates in the wake of the dotcom implosion. </p> <p>Cheap credit and a belief in the discovery of a new paradigm in investment sounds a flammable mix, as the dotcom bubble itself proved. The added problem with hedge funds is that everybody is chasing the same opportunities - everybody wants to be a momentum investor in the belief that easy returns of 15% a year are available. All modern investment experience says they are not there for all. DKW reckons it could end painfully. \"Because of the widespread leverage employed by the hedge funds, any reduction in their number could drastically affect market prices,\" it says. You have been warned. </p> <p><strong>Going Dutch</strong></p> <p>Neelie Kroes, the new EU competition commissioner, has at least one attribute in her favour: she is neither French nor German, nor British for that matter. Certainly, a French or German appointee would be sorely tempted, and pushed by Paris or Berlin, to pursue a policy of defending and promoting \"national champions\" rather than enforcing stricter rules on state aid. The Dutch liberal-conservative, who sits on the boards of Volvo and mm02 inter alia, has a reputation as a tough, energetic, perhaps impatient, politician who will have to refine - and rethink - the legacy left by Mario Monti. </p> <p>Signor Monti is still bitterly resented in the US for blocking the merger between GE and Honeywell and, more recently, imposing a record fine on Microsoft. He also incurred French and German wrath by blocking politically-inspired mergers and demanding repayment of state aid. But the outgoing commissioner also suffered some severe legal defeats, such as over Airtours and Tetra Laval, and has been forced to trim back on state aid rules. Witness the deal with France that led to yesterday's capital-raising by Alstom. </p> <p>Competition lawyers at Linklaters believe Ms Kroes will bring a lot of private sector understanding but face problems tackling reform of the law on dominant companies to give more power to national governments - and those state aid rules which companies and governments bend in an unholy and spurious alliance to promote employment. </p> <p><strong>Up Green's street</strong></p> <p>It sounds idyllic. An exclusive, five-star resort nestling in a Spanish valley, sheltered by the Murcian hills and fringed by the Mediterranean sea. Watersports, golf and tennis. A casino for millionaires struggling to find ways to throw away their money. La Manga is a byword for decadence and excess. The Chardonnay flows, the jewellery glints in the sunshine and the phrase \"bling, bling\" lingers in the twilight. </p> <p>P&amp;O wants \u00a3100m for the resort as a single job lot. Understandably, the company feels La Manga does not fit with its portfolio of ferries and container ports. </p> <p>The only drawback? Footballers. Residents must share their space with the likes of Paul Gascoigne, Rio Ferdinand and Stan Collymore who have all, at some point, mistaken La Manga's fixtures and fittings for footballs. </p> <p>Tanya Turner from \"Footballers' Wives\" would lurve La Manga. She could showcase her fake bake, indulge in a little Celine Dion on the iPod by the pool and romance would be in the air. </p> <p>So who could nurture La Manga in a way which P&amp;O cannot? The place is too tacky for Sir Richard Branson, too upmarket for Stelios Haji-Ioannou and too expensive for struggling leisure companies such as MyTravel. </p> <p>The buyer should have an eye for a vanity purchase, an appreciation for the high life and a wallet bulging with cash. </p> <p>Step forward Philip Green, the orange-skinned buccaneering billionaire of the high street. If he hasn't been to La Manga, the order of the universe is flawed. La Manga would be the perfect place to plot a fresh assault on M&amp;S. Come on, Phil, wave your wad.</p>",
  "Australia's poorest state was in uproar this week over a \u00a3250,000 \"golden goodbye\" awarded to the Tasmanian governor, Richard Butler, who resigned on Monday. The former UN weapons inspector's abrasive personality has made him massively unpopular in the state, culminating in a staff walkout last week. <p>The opposition leader, Rene Hidding, described the payout as an \"obscene moonlight robbery of ordinary Tasmanians\", but the state premier, Peter Lennon, told the Hobart <b>Mercury</b> that there had been no sound basis for the dismissal. \"The only other way that you end Mr Butler's term as governor is through dismissal,\" he said. \"What were the grounds?\" He refused to be drawn on Mr Butler's high-handed behaviour as governor. \"It's not one particular instance or event that created the controversy,\" he said. \"Everyone has their own style.\" </p> <p>The case was taken by many republicans as evidence of rottenness in an outdated system. \"Being pompous and arrogant used to be an unwritten part of the job description of the Queen's representative in Australia,\" wrote the <b> Australian</b>'s Mike Steketee. \"Now it is grounds for resignation.\" </p> <p>Back on the mainland, the tabloids had bigger fish to fry. Jana Pittman, Australia's 400m hurdles world champion, who is considered the country's best hope of a track gold medal at the Olympics, injured her knee while warming up for a training race in Zurich. </p> <p>A gloomy prognosis from a Swiss specialist was greeted with national mourning on Sunday. \"I want to say sorry to all of Australia because I feel I have let them down,\" a tearful Pittman told Sydney's <b> Sun-Herald</b>. \"I'm hoping for a miracle.\" </p> <p>The next day the miracle materialised in the form of an operation by a London surgeon, Fares Haddad, prompting more front-page splashes of the photogenic 21-year-old. \"She could beat nature in a rush to the starting blocks,\" mused the Sydney <b> Daily Telegraph</b>'s resident medico Dr Doug Stewart. \"Whether she will be 100% fit and able to do herself justice is another matter.\" </p> <p>The effects of injury were also concentrating minds at Sydney's supreme court, where 57-year-old Richard Sheehan is demanding a A$750,000 (\u00a3290,000) payout from a shopping centre where he slipped on a battered potato slice in 1998. Surveillance photographs showed him standing up and lifting his electric wheelchair into his car boot. </p> <p>Photographs he took of the offending potato had been changed to emphasise the mess, Adelaide's <b> Advertiser</b> reported. \"He admitted digitally altering his photographs to enhance the \"oily substance around the debris\", it said. </p> <p>The offending mess of the Iraq war also caused waves in Canberra on Sunday, when a group of 43 former diplomats and military leaders issued a joint statement condemning the government's foreign policy. \"We are concerned that Australia was committed to join the invasion of Iraq on the basis of false assumptions and the deception of the Australian people,\" the statement read. </p> <p>The Australian's influen-tial columnist Paul Kelly described it as \"the strongest critique for decades of any Australian government\" to have come from the foreign affairs establishment. Faced with such attacks, the government's ruling coalition responded with its weapon of mass destruction: alliteration. </p> <p>De-Anne Kelly, from the ruling coalition's National party, described the signatories as \"doddering daiquiri diplomats from a past era\". Writing in the Melbourne <b> Age</b>, a signatory and former ambassador to Israel, Peter Rogers, gave as good as he got. \"Our profiles may be podgy, our prostates prominent, but our penchant for the profound persists,\" he pontificated. </p> <p>A fresh doping scandal on Wednesday threatened to disrupt the mood of this sports-mad nation on the brink of Olympics hysteria. </p> <p>Competitors at Brisbane's annual agricultural show were excluded from the competition after they were spotted giving hormone injections to cattle to make their udders more distended, the key to success in bovine beauty contests. </p> <p>Judge Trevor Beckingham was dismayed that the noble contest could sink to such depths. \"It is against rules and regulations and against fair play, as a lot of labour and a lot of love goes into preparing a champion cow,\" he told Brisbane's <b> Courier-Mail</b>.</p>",
  "A Texas murderer who has taken his fight for clemency to the internet, where he sells handmade greeting cards and other artworks, is asking the state parole board to give him life in jail instead of the execution due on August 26. <p>James Vernon Allridge was condemned for shooting a shop assistant in Fort Worth, Texas, during two days in 1985 when he and three others were said to have carried out at least 20 robberies. One of the three was his brother Ronald, executed in 1995 for another murder. </p> <p>Relatives and others say in support of his appeal that he has been a model prisoner and poses no threat to anyone. </p> <p>His brother Darren said: \"In spite of what he's done, he cherishes and lives his life to the fullest that he can.\" </p> <p>The petition, which claims that he has been rehabilitated, includes statements by former prison officers and jurors, and examples of his art. </p> <p>If the board grants his appeal he will be eligible for parole almost immediately, but Jim Marcus, a Texas defence service lawyer helping with his appeal, said he was not likely to be freed. </p> <p>Victims' rights advocates such as Dianne Clements have criticised the greeting card sales (at <a href=\"http://www.ccadp.org/jamesallridge.htm\">ccadp.org/jamesallridge.htm</a>), which are helping fund his appeals, as \"murderabilia\". </p> <p>\"You're sentenced to death for the crime you committed, not your metamorphosis in a controlled environment,\" she said. </p> <p>\"What is rehabilitation anyway? This guy draws pictures and sells them for money. That doesn't negate the murder.\" </p> <p>Lisa Fine, one of Allridge's lawyers, said: \"This was a senseless murder. We are not asking that he be absolved of his guilt, only that he be allowed to spend the rest of his life in prison for what he's done.\" </p> <p>Allridge was visited recently by Susan Sarandon, who won an Academy award for her portrayal of the crusader against capital punishment Sister Helen Prejean in Dead Man Walking and is herself an outspoken opponent of capital punishment. </p> <p>One of jurors who convicted him, Laury Robertson, said she supported his efforts and regretted that he had been sentenced to death.</p>",
  "<p>Toys R Us put itself up for sale yesterday, making it the latest victim of the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart. </p> <p>The company is the third specialist toy retailer in the US to concede defeat in the past nine months to out-of-town discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target. In December the upmarket FAO Schwartz filed for bankruptcy, followed by KB Toys a month later. </p> <p>Toys R Us, which operates more than 1,460 stores, said it also planned to spin off its Babies R Us chain. </p> <p>The firm lost the mantle of America's leading toy seller to Wal-Mart in 1999. Some analysts have questioned Wal-Mart's cut-throat tactics and aired suspicions that the company sells toys at a loss to generate traffic for other lines. </p> <p>Toys R Us attempted to restore its fortunes with a programme of upgrades to its American chain, improving service and offering more exclusive toys. The company operates 683 Toys R Us stores in the US, a further 579 overseas and 200 Babies R Us outlets. </p> <p>The effort to revive the chain's fortunes failed to make a difference. Profits during the fourth quarter of last year, the crucial holiday season, halved to $144m (\u00a378m). In the first quarter of this year, Toys R Us losses widened to $28m as same-store sales slid by 5.6%. </p> <p>The company said it planned to cut costs drastically at the core toy business, presumably to attract buyers. It intends to cut annual costs at its head office by $125m, halve capital spending and take $150m in markdowns to liquidate stock. </p> <p>The stores portfolio will be kept under review but it is unlikely to close any ahead of the busy Christmas period. </p> <p>In a statement, the company said it had decided to \"explore the possible sale of the global toy business as well as to prepare for a possible spin-off of Babies R Us\". The two divisions, it added, were at \"fundamentally different phases\" in their growth cycles. Operating profits at Babies R Us in the first quarter were 17% higher than a year earlier. </p> <p>Chairman and chief executive John Eyler said the \"overall strategic plan we are pursuing is intended to enable Babies R Us to continue to prosper as a separate entity while also putting our global toy business on a solid foundation\". </p> <p>The aim was to \"create a radically different global toy business with a powerful ability to generate cash\". </p> <p>Credit Suisse First Boston is acting as a financial adviser. </p> <p>The growth of Wal-Mart divides America. Proponents praise the chain for creating jobs, generating higher tax revenues, often in low-income areas, and lowering prices. </p> <p>Critics say the arrival of a Wal-Mart destroys local businesses and can rip the heart out of a town centre. It is also criticised for its low wages.</p>",
  "An Italian envoy will fly to Libya tomorrow to discuss radical plans to set up \"reception centres\" for would-be immigrants, with officials from both countries estimating that up to 2 million people have already massed on the north African coast in readiness for an opportunity to travel by boat to Europe. <p>The scale of the problem has been recognised by President Muammar Gadafy's regime, which has indicated that it needs help to deal with the number of people who have travelled to Libya's poorly patrolled coast and the vast open deserts to the south. </p> <p>The reception centre proposal, which has drawn criticism from some quarters, is part of a series of cooperation initiatives Italy is spearheading in an effort to control the flow of desperate illegal immigrants across the Mediterranean from northern Africa. </p> <p>Libya is the only north African country which does not have a formal agreement with the EU on tackling illegal immigration, and has become the focal point of refugees, most of whom have travelled from across Africa and the Middle East. </p> <p>The debate over illegal immigration has become a major political issue in Italy. It flared again this week when African boat people said they had thrown the bodies of 23 fellow travellers overboard after they died of dehydration and exhaustion on the 15-day Mediterranean crossing. </p> <p>One member of Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet said all would-be immigrants should be sent home rather than be allowed to land. </p> <p>As Italy urged help from the EU, Libya's foreign minister, Muhammad Abdel-Rahman Shalgham, said his country needed cooperation to tackle the problem. \"If for you Italians illegal immigration is a problem, for us it's much more - its an invasion,\" he told the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa. </p> <p>Since Tripoli decided to come out of the international wilderness and revive ties with the west, cooperation on immigration has begun. Libya has begun to police its southern borders with Chad, Niger and Sudan, with the aim of ultimately pushing the immigration frontline further south into Africa. </p> <p>But Tripoli has often complained that sanctions meant it could not acquire the necessary night vision equipment, bullet-proof border patrol vehicles, surveillance motorboats and aircraft for repatriating would-be illegal immigrants. </p> <p>Under proposals which the head of Italy's immigration police, Alessandro Pansa, will present to Libyan officials tomorrow, Italy's immigration police and other authorities would advise Libyan officials on setting up the reception centres. </p> <p>Italian officials in the past have suggested that Tripoli had deliberately \"opened the valve\" of immigrants heading for Italy to increase the pressure on Europe to lift its economic embargo. </p> <p>Now, after Colonel Gadafy's government has taken another step towards normalising its relations with the west by agreeing to pay compensation for the victims of a bombing of a Berlin nightclub in 1986, Germany is showing signs of a readiness to reciprocate. The Netherlands, which currently holds the EU's presidency, has reportedly agreed to raise the question of ending Europe's embargo on Libya at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers in September. </p> <p>Germany's interior minister, Otto Schily, who is visiting Italy today, is expected to propose that Rome and Berlin formalise bilateral agreements on cooperation with Libya. </p> <p>The two countries then hope to win the backing of their fellow European heavyweights, Britain, France and Spain. </p> <p>But Mr Schily has already met criticism in Germany for his plans. </p> <p>Members of the Green party and the former leader of the Christian Democrats, Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, are reported to have accused the interior minister of trying to create \"concentration camps on the edge of the Sahara\". </p> <p>Mr Schily has insisted that the new camps will operate in the same way as those along the EU's southern shores and would not deny would-be immigrants the right to request asylum in Italy or Germany. </p> <p>He has emphasised that the proposal is designed to help deal with an emergency. </p> <p>\"It's hard to understand why a reception centre is a reception centre when it's in Lampedusa [a tiny Italian island between Sicily and Tunisia, often the chosen destination for illegal immigrants], but when it's in Africa it becomes a concentration camp,\" the German media reported him as saying.</p>",
  "<p>We live in an increasingly mobile world, where we're expected to be connected to many different PCs and servers - no matter where we are or what we're doing. We may need to work on a file only to find we left it on our office PC, or we may get a call in the middle of the night asking us to reboot the mail server. The only problem is that we're miles away, and there's no chance of getting back to the PC or to the server in time. But help is at hand, because this is a job for the new generation of remote access software. </p> <p>Remote access tools come in many shapes and sizes. There are tools for helping people access desktop PCs and servers wherever they are, and with whatever device they are using. Others help support desks see what users are doing, to help solve problems. Then there are tools that deliver applications to desktop PCs and laptops, keeping the programs on servers where they're easier to manage. </p> <p>A good remote access tool uses as little bandwidth as possible, so you can use slow GPRS mobile phone connections as well as high-speed broadband. Some tools can even reformat remote screens so that you can work with them on PDAs and smartphones. PocketWatch's Pocket Hub service will allow you to control your PC from a Wap-enabled phone. </p> <p>We're probably most familiar with tools such as VNC and Microsoft's Remote Desktop, which deliver a desktop view over a network. You can use the remote machine from your current device, without having to change keyboard or mouse. System administrators find these tools useful - allowing quick access to remote servers without needing to go into the machine room. Microsoft's technology only works with Windows systems, though there are clients for Windows CE and Apple Macintoshes. The open source VNC is a different kind of beast, and supports Unix and Linux as well as Windows: this allows Linux users to work with Windows systems, and vice versa. There are VNC viewers for most operating systems, including handheld devices, which can connect to any machine running a VNC server. </p> <p>VNC was developed in the AT&amp;T research lab in Cambridge, but after it closed, several of the VNC development team founded RealVNC to manage the development of the VNC platform, and to work on commercial versions. The first enterprise version will be released next month, with security and encryption enhancements, and the ability to link into enterprise authentication services. The RealVNC team has also been involved with another company, Adder, to link VNC into a hardware remote control - a KVM box over IP. </p> <p>Apple has used the open source VNC code as the basis of its Remote Desktop tool. This can be used to install software packages, as well as watching up to 50 client desktops at the same time - not just Macs, as Remote Desktop can work with any VNC server on any operating system. </p> <p>Helping other users without leaving your desk is a considerable time saver, and it is strange that many businesses don't take advantage of the tools that are built into their PC's operating system. Windows XP includes Remote Assistance. This allows a help desk to work directly with a user's PC. Password-protected sessions allow users to control access to their PCs, and chat windows allow the helpdesk staff to communicate with them. The helpdesk can share control of the PC with the user, or just watch while the user demonstrates the problem. And Remote Assistance isn't just for the office: it's ideal for suporting users who work from home. </p> <p>Tools such as Citrix's recent purchase, GoToMyPC, allow you to use a web browser plug-in to access your PC from anywhere. Unlike some remote access tools, GoToMyPC lets you copy files from a remote PC to the system you are working on. It can be tedious working remotely over a dial-up line, so working with a local copy of a file can make things easier. 3a Lab's LogMeIn.com offers similar features, plus file synchronisation and sharing. </p> <p>Remote access support tools are an important part of the tool box for companies that provide IT services to small businesses. With the rise of business broadband, they allow support without a visit - helping the provider to work with more clients, and delivering an improved service at the same time. There's no need to wait for a visit for a simple reconfiguration. Remote access means that it can be carried out when server load permits, or in a gap between emergencies. </p> <p>Another set of remote access tools deliver applications to users' desktops. This approach means that IT departments don't have to maintain hundreds, or even thousands, of desktop installations. Tools such as Citrix Metaframe and Tarentella's Secure Global Desktop deliver the application's user interfaces while running the application on central servers, helping businesses consolidate on blade servers to keep costs down. As only the user interface is delivered remotely, it is easier to keep data secure, and it is possible to add a further layer of security by encrypting remote traffic. </p> <p>Remote access isn't just about remote desktops. It's about tools that deploy software across an enterprise; and that can help rescue and recover PCs. The more calls an IT help desk can deal with in a day, the happier the users - and it helps the business's bottom line. </p> <p>There's also a useful side effect of remote access: some tools, such as those from 1E, allow operators to turn off desktop PCs that have been left on, wasting electricity.</p>",
  "<p>Tottenham have made an undisclosed offer to Bayern Munich for the England midfielder Owen Hargreaves, who may also attract the attention of Arsenal if - or more likely when - Patrick Vieira leaves Highbury for Real Madrid. </p> <p>Hargreaves is keen to play in the Premiership and is expected to leave Germany this summer, provided Bayern sanction his departure. The club would want \u00a35m-\u00a36m for the 23-year-old, who has two years on his contract. </p> <p>Spurs see the versatile Canadian-born England international as a key component in their attempt to inject youth, pace and strength into a midfield that was unconvincing last season. </p> <p>The strategy has already seen them sign Sean Davis and Pedro Mendes and they continue to pursue Manchester City's Shaun Wright-Phillips, who was in talks with the Eastlands club yesterday over extending his contract, which has two years to run. </p> <p>Hargreaves is not averse to joining Spurs even though it would constitute a change of environment from Bayern, where he has become used to competing in the Champions League and challenging for the domestic title. He is aware that Tottenham are keen to build a team with and around him and knows he would be joining a squad full of young players with potential. </p> <p>Bayern have not yet agreed to make Hargreaves available, particularly as he has impressed the new coach Felix Magath during pre-season. But they are expected to sanction his sale at the right price, aware that his value will dip over the coming months if he chooses not to extend his contract. </p> <p>The principal complication for Tottenham could come if Arsenal enter the race. That is conceivable if Vieira moves to Madrid, which is expected in days. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is an admirer of Hargreaves and the club have made discreet inquiries over recent months. </p> <p>Hargreaves had spoken, earlier this year, of his admiration for the Gunners, saying: \"Arsenal are a wonderful team. I'd love to play for them but I just don't know if they need any new players.\" </p> <p>He was spelling out his desire to leave Bayern for England this summer and added: \"The Premiership, in particular, is brilliant and the fans are fantastic and just to be there every week would be a dream for me.\" </p> <p>Aston Villa will take advantage of Saturday's Premiership fixture against Southampton to pursue their interest in the Saints striker James Beattie. </p> <p>Talks have been going on for several weeks and Villa's chairman Doug Ellis, mindful that Charlton and Spurs are also interested in the 26-year-old forward, wants a face-to-face meeting with Rupert Lowe, his Southampton counterpart. </p> <p>Lowe has already rejected Villa's \u00a36m bid for Beattie and told them they will have to increase the offer by \u00a32m. </p> <p>Ellis is a notoriously dogged negotiator when it comes to transfers - sometimes to Villa's detriment - but the signing of Beattie would complete what he and the manager David O'Leary see as a squad capable of challenging for Europe. </p> <p>O'Leary has brought in four new faces as well as persuading Olof Mellberg, Juan Pablo Angel and Gareth Barry to extend their contracts. And yesterday the club completed another deal, when the Ecuadorian defender Ulises de la Cruz signed a two-year extension to his contract. </p> <p>\"We have a nucleus of top players for the next three or four years and I'm convinced that we're on our way,\" Ellis said. \"We're not finished yet but the fact is players of note are not easily available.\" </p> <p>Crystal Palace are set to buy Fitz Hall from Southampton for \u00a31.5m. The move would reunite the 23-year-old defender with his manager at Oldham, Iain Dowie. \"We have given Crystal Palace permission to speak to Fitz,\" said Lowe, who paid \u00a3250,000 for Hall last summer. </p> <p>Palace are also expected to sign Ivan Kaviedes, 26, a striker who has been on trial. He plays for Barcelona in his native Ecuador and has also featured for Celta Vigo of Spain.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Northerner, Guardian Unlimited's weekly digest of the best of the northern press. <p><b>TRANSPORTS OF DELIGHT</b></p> <p>The writer of this week's Northerner is a Midlander-turned-southerner who has spent the past few days marvelling at the musical parp of Manchester's trams, the 50p fare for a ticket, the magnificence of Victoria station and the extraordinary spaciousness of the city.</p> <p>Of course, if Mancunians had to endure London Bridge station and fight their way through the capital, they'd probably adopt the tired snarl and I'd-tell-you-to-eff-off-if-I-had-the-nerve expression of Londoners. </p> <p>But not everywhere in the north-west enjoys the benefits of the Metrolink tram. The decision to abandon the planned extension still appals many locals.</p> <p>\"Manchester is a far easier and more pleasant place to be than Stockport, where I live, which is smelly, noisy, choked with traffic and SMBC's traffic policy is abysmal,\" Frieda Chorlton wrote to the letters page of the Stockport Express. \"I believe in the light rail transport system and I think the government has withdrawn its support partly due to the success of the link. Call it jealousy of the north if you like... Blair and his capital see [Manchester] as a threat to London.\"</p> <p>Now, Frieda, that's going a bit too far.</p> <p>Michael Anderson of Tulse Hill in the south of the capital tells readers he wants to move back to Stockport. \"Everything down here is focused on London, London, London, Radio, TV, jobs, you name it.

The last thing he's going to allow is a demo calling for better public transport in another city.</p> <p>_________________________________</p> <p>\"If you've got a big hammer you can get a lot of business at the moment,\" David Sapsford, Liverpool University's professor of applied economics, told the Northerner yesterday.</p> <p>Demolition is big business on Merseyside. Such big business, in fact, that Scousers who fled Liverpool during the long recessions of the 1970s and 1980s are being urged to return to Merseyside and take advantage of cheap property prices there. The Daily Post was understandably intrigued.</p> <p>\"Give Us Back Your Scousers\" - no, really - is appealing to expatriate Scousers who grew up or studied in the city to help fill some of the vacancies created by the city's grand scale redevelopment projects. Construction and retail firms are trying to recruit 8,000 people to work at the GBP750m Albert and King's Docks developments alone.</p> <p>\"Come back home to Liverpool,\" pleads Liverpool Needs You's website. \"Your city needs you.\"</p> <p>If knocking things down and rebuilding doesn't appeal, there are also plenty of jobs in retail. \"Skilled workers are in very short supply,\" confirmed Prof Sapsford. \"The biotechnology sector is very large at the moment and growing very rapidly.\" The expansion of Liverpool John Lennon airport has also created many new jobs.</p> <p>The city, which was once a byword for unemployment and deprivation, now has an unemployment rate of 2.9% and the fastest rate of job creation outside London. \"We're finding it increasingly difficult to fill vacancies,\" Mike Hill, the director of a Merseyside recruitment consultancy and the architect of the campaign, told the Northerner yesterday.</p> <p>Many of the emigres spent three years studying in Liverpool, but \"once they'd done a degree, they decided there weren't sufficient opportunities in the city,\" Mr Hill said.</p> <p>Liverpool's population fell by 300,000 between 1972 and 2002. In recent months, however, the city centre has undergone a minor renaissance. Property prices have risen sharply as a result, though the number of houses changing hands fell this year. Lack of housing stock and fewer first-time buyers with sufficient funds is thought to be responsible.</p> <p>An influx of skilled professionals would make things even more difficult for first-time buyers, Mr Hill admitted. \"We envisage that the vast majority of people will come from either the south-east or Manchester. If you look at house prices in Manchester or London, one of the nice things about Liverpool is that there is the opportunity to upgrade.\"</p> <p>Failure to attract enough workers, he warned, could lead to wage inflation, scupper planned developments and tip the city back into recession.</p> <p>Liverpudlians were accustomed to the notion of economic mobility, he added. Many are the descendants of families who left Ireland in the 19th century. The surge in the city's economy echoes the boom in Ireland during the 1990s, when many Britons of Irish descent headed back across the water.</p> <p>________________________________</p> <p>The Environment Agency issued scores of flood warnings and even patrolled the streets of Sheffield with a loudhailer to warn of the danger the river Sheaf would burst its banks.</p> <p>In the end, however, the river banks held; the drains didn't.

Liverpool's Daily Post has asked readers to help it find a far larger body of water which is apparently lurking under Toxteth in Liverpool.</p> <p>The Cains brewery in Stanhope Street, a red brick edifice built in the mid-19th century, is thought to harbour a lake. \"Stories... tell of a large, deep mass of water at a great depth beneath the Liverpool plant where workmen used a boat to travel beneath the cellars,\" breathed the paper. \"Other tales tell how it couldn't be used for drinking water because it is badly contaminated by nearby cemeteries.\" How did they know, the Northerner wonders?</p> <p>The only employee thought to have known more about the whereabouts of the lake died two weeks ago. Unfortunately, for the Post, the directors of Cains appear to be wary of allowing amateur marine archaeologists to penetrate their brewery. \"People need to understand that the brewery site is vast and the cellars are incredibly deep and we are so busy we haven't got time to look for it,\" the joint managing director, Ajmail Dusanj, warned readers.

  "<p>Is a chasm opening between the NHS leaders and frontline staff? Cynics might say those at the top have always seemed remote to the healthcare workers who see patients face to face daily on wards, in clinics and surgeries. But this particular gap concerns their respective perceptions of the progress of reforms.</p> <p>The summer conference season provided a ready platform for ministers and senior managers to talk up achievements so far. And who could blame them? They have a duty to give credit where it's due and sustain morale. </p> <p>For example, the main message of the NHS chief executive, Sir Nigel Crisp, has been how he has detected \"a real groundswell of optimism, confidence in delivery, real pride in what is being achieved, and real ambition to achieve so much more\".</p> <p>Certainly the NHS has come a long way since 1997, when - as ministers have also pointed out - it was a desperately failing organisation, which the previous government had underfunded and let flounder. Now it has more money, more staff, shorter waiting times and is gradually improving its facilities.</p> <p>Ministers are anxious to register that improvement in the public consciousness, and are frustrated by the media's implacable scepticism and compulsion to interpret every dropped bedpan as proof that nothing has changed nor ever will. Perhaps they can be forgiven a little hyperbole, especially with the next election approaching. </p> <p>But the danger of Panglossian temptations is that they make any who succumb appear hopelessly out of touch with the real world. Undoubtedly, Sir Nigel's optimistic, confident, proud and ambitious staff exist in pockets around the health service. But it would stretch credulity to claim they were typical.</p> <p>Some staff are keenly aware of recent improvements, and have played a direct part in bringing them about. Others will tell you they are not aware of any, even when they are taking place around them, while some acknowledge change in their own environment but doubt the trend is noticeable elsewhere.</p> <p>Although the 2003 staff survey results, published last month, found NHS workers \"generally satisfied\" with their jobs, they also revealed high levels of harassment, pressure, errors and long hours. More than a third said they often thought about leaving their current employer.</p> <p>Patients can sense the prevailing mood of staff. If it really was one of heady optimism, that would soon foster renewed public confidence in the NHS - and the government would be entitled to believe its problems really were on the run. Conversely, if patients detect no change in the world-weary endurance of old, much of its reform programme will have been in vain.</p> <p>A range of storm signals hoisted over the summer has suggested it is far too early to claim the NHS has turned the corner. </p> <p>First came the Audit Commission's worries about the \"major risks\" of financial instability, service difficulties and poorer patient outcomes that \"payment by results\" could bring. Then The Guardian's own survey revealed most NHS hospitals in England will find it hard to operate legally now the European working-time directive limiting doctors' hours is in force.</p> <p>Next, the Commons health select committee drew attention to primary care trusts' (PCTs) \"varying states of readiness\" for taking over responsibility for out-of-hours services from GPs. The committee's chair, David Hinchliffe, said one witness had claimed PCTs \"were operating in a different universe, assuming everything was fine\".</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research raised more concerns about PCTs' ability to shoulder the burden of change that the government expects, given their state of immaturity. </p> <p>Even such a basic improvement as clean hospital toilets has hit snags: about half the 86,000 taking part in the national patient survey thought toilets had got dirtier in the past year. No sophisticated nuance of policy at stake here: just a stubborn niggle that could have a disproportionate effect on public perception.</p> <p>So a long way to go yet. The NHS has made encouraging progress, but it could still all go pear-shaped. In their impatience to breathe the heady air of success, those at the top must not lose sight of the view from the ground - or everything might come a cropper.</p> <p>\u00b7<strong> Peter Davies</strong> is a freelance writer specialising in health.

  "<p>Brenda, who lives next door to Danny Williams's parents, is ecstatic. \"We stayed up to watch the fight on TV,\" she says. \"The whole street did. I couldn't get to sleep for two hours afterwards. Well done, Danny. It was fantastic.\" Her husband, it transpires, had 200 quid on Danny at 6-1. No wonder she couldn't sleep. </p> <p>Williams, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion, has always been a hero in his native Brixton. Now, after knocking out \"Iron\" Mike Tyson in four rounds on July 30, he's a hero in the rest of Britain too, and on course for a shot at the heavyweight world title, maybe as early as December. </p> <p>Best of all, he's a bloody great bloke. If you were talking nose to nose to Tyson in his mother's kitchen, you would feel petrified. With Williams, it seems the most natural thing in the world. He is knackered, jet-lagged having only just got back from the United States, has just had to sit through a two-hour press conference announcing his next fight (Oleg Maskaev in October, for boxing aficionados) and has been kidnapped by the Guardian and taken to his parents' home in Brixton - but he accepts it all without a murmur. He is the cuddliest, friendliest potential world heavyweight champion imaginable. </p> <p>The press conference, as usual for boxing, is at a plush hotel in central London. Williams's promoter, Frank Warren, gives a slick presentation and then disappears in his chauffeur-driven Bentley. Williams is about to take the tube back to his parents' house when we grab him. </p> <p>Williams's father, Augustus, a former car-worker, is surprisingly small and wiry. He is watching the racing channel when we arrive. \"My dad's a betting man,\" says Williams. \"He had a dream when I was small that I would be world champion one day, and I told him he should have had a tenner on it when I was born because he'd have made some crazy money.\" Augustus has a deep, Jamaican-inflected voice and a dry wit, but he's tough, too. When Williams was four, his father set about ensuring that his dream became a reality, teaching the boy to box. \"He used to take me on the pads to show me how to punch,\" says Williams. \"Then when I was eight he took me to a boxing gym. All this time I didn't really like it, I couldn't stand it, but he took me to the gym and got me into boxing. He's very strict and you had to do what he said.\" </p> <p>Augustus's tough love was counterbalanced by Williams's mother, a funny, welcoming woman happy to put her husband in his place. Augustus is just about to talk about his own fights as an amateur in the 60s when she interrupts. \"He wasn't a boxer,\" she says dismissively. \"He just used to go to the gym and prance about. He was a keep-fit fanatic.\" </p> <p>Williams, the doubters said before the Tyson fight, would be slaughtered; he was too nice, didn't have the killer instinct. He had lost two of his preceding six fights, had lost his European and Commonwealth titles, appeared to be on the slide. This was make or break, the last-chance saloon; as, indeed, it was for the bankrupt, hopelessly in debt Tyson. </p> <p>Tyson, indeed, came out like a whirlwind and jolted Williams, who admits he \"wobbled\". But Tyson's storm blew itself out and Williams took him apart, forcing a stoppage in the fourth round. How did the nice guy make himself turn nasty? \"When the bell sounded, I felt hyper,\" he says. \"I said, 'You've taken me away from my kids, I'm going to smash you up. I want what you've had - the big houses. I want to be able to buy my mum and dad anything they want; I want all that - and the only way I can get it is by beating you.' I was really determined.\" </p> <p>Why does a fighter fight? Not bloodlust, that's for sure. A desire for \"respect\", key word among the boxing fraternity, and for cash. Mostly cash. These men are not called prize-fighters for nothing. Williams earned $250,000 (\u00a3137,000) for fighting Tyson - by far the biggest purse of his career (though he is still waiting for a large part of it, and also complains about the weakness of the dollar). </p> <p>\"There are two things that motivate a boxer,\" says Williams. \"The first is money and the desire to live comfortably. The second is that I want to achieve great things. My heroes are Rocky Marciano, Jersey Joe Walcott and Muhammad Ali. I want to be on top of the world.\" Augustus's dream for him was very precise: not just to win one world title but to win all three of the main versions. </p> <p>If Williams had lost to Tyson, his career would have been in ruins; having beaten him, he is now being feted. His return from the US was delayed because so many television stations wanted to talk to him; he says that just walking down the street now takes him an hour - so many hands have to be shaken and autographs signed. Doesn't that get on his nerves? \"No,\" he says firmly. \"Enjoy it while it's there. You never know how long it will last.\" </p> <p>But he has no intention of repeating the wretched cycle of rags to riches and back to rags that has dogged so many fighters - not least Tyson, who earned $400m in his career, and blew the lot. \"People always say learn from your mistakes,\" he says, \"but I also try to learn from other people's mistakes. Whenever I get money from my fights, I invest it wisely. When they get big purses, fighters always go to buy the flashiest cars. I'd rather put it into property.\" He recently bought himself a Peugeot 406 coupe. Nice - but no Ferrari. </p> <p>Williams, who is 31, converted to Islam in 1999 and says his religion keeps him focused. \"My faith means that no matter how famous I get, I'll always keep my feet on the ground. It's also given me security. I feel at peace with myself.\" Islam is central to his life: after the press conference, he disappears behind a screen to pray, insisting that he be given a few minutes alone. </p> <p>He lives in Peckham with his wife, Zoe, and their two young daughters. \"Wife\" has to be qualified, because they have so far only gone through an Islamic rite which does not bind them under UK law; a register office wedding is planned but may have to be postponed if a world title fight takes place this year. He says they live in Peckham because they couldn't afford a house in Brixton. Before the Tyson fight, Williams was not a huge earner and at times in his career, to make ends meet, has had to do labouring jobs and \"door work\". He says he would like his daughters to grow up in a less challenging environment than he faced. </p> <p>He tells me that the only time he was ever in court was to do jury service, and he says it with pride. Black boys from his neighbourhood were frequently in trouble with the police; his father's iron rule stopped him from ever being tempted. \"I was going to be world champion,\" he says. \"That was programmed into me. I thought I'd get money the right way. Many times I'd seen people on the corner selling crack and driving big cars, but that never got to me because I always believed that I was going to make money from boxing. Many of my friends have got killed or been put in prison. What I've done is the proper way to go.\" </p> <p>His plan is to win the world title, have another four or five \"massive\" fights, and then quit. \"I want to make my mark, make enough money and then get out of the game. Boxing's a drug, a serious drug. It holds people - look at George Foreman, going on boxing into his 50s.\" </p> <p>Most boxing stories are tragedies - punchy fighters, going on too long because they are broke, ending up sitting on bar stools reliving dimly remembered fights of long ago. Williams, family man and Peugeot driver, recognises the occupational hazards of his trade and believes he can avoid them. Dreams count - but so do nightmares.</p>",

  "There has always been treasure on Naoshima. It used to be copper, but the refining industry that once fuelled the local economy has shrunk, and with it, the island's population. <p>Now a very different commodity is bringing people back: art. </p> <p>Turning this pretty island off the coast of Okayama, 435 miles south-west of Tokyo, into an international art centre is the unlikely vision of Soichiro Fukutake, an entrepreneur who has delved into his personal fortune to acquire works by David Hockney, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Claude Monet. </p> <p>Although the Japanese public is no stranger to western art, masterpieces including Picassos and Renoirs too often hang, unseen by most, in private collections. Most of the best western art on public display is in Tokyo. </p> <p>But Naoshima, a five-hour trip by rail and ferry from the capital, is mounting a credible challenge for the attention of a new generation of Japanese art tourists. This month the latest phase in the art-island project of Mr Fukutake was completed with the opening of the Chichu art museum on Naoshima's south coast. Designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando, the museum is on three floors, concealed beneath a grassy mound. </p> <p>Inside is a small collection of installations and oil paintings, including five from Monet's water-lily series. </p> <p>A short drive away is Benesse House, a museum and hotel which opened in 1992 and which is home to 20th century works including Hockney's A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard, Acatlan, and Pollock's Black and White Polyptych. </p> <p>Mr Fukutake, who rarely gives interviews, refuses to disclose the size of his investments in art, although he is known to have paid a billion yen for the southern half of the island in the late 1980s. </p> <p>But his reticence evaporates when he talks about the Chichu museum, which he insists is an attempt to conjure the more leisurely, culture-filled days of pre-industrial Japan. \"I want people to feel the environment around them when they are here. They should be given time to pause and think, and art is a way for them to do that,\" he said. </p> <p>Each exhibition room in the museum is tailor-made for individual works. The five Monet paintings, for example, hang on creamy white walls made from the plaster that was used in old Japanese castles. The floor is covered with 700,000 cubes of Italian marble. Stretching across an entire wall is Monet's Water-Lily Pond (1915-1926), which Mr Fukutake bought after seeing it at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts in 1998. </p> <p>Another dominant presence is Walter De Maria's 2004 installation Time/Timeless/No Time, a highly polished granite sphere which took 18 months to complete. Gilded wood hangs on the surrounding walls, giving the room the feel of a new-age Shinto shrine. </p> <p>Mr Fukutake, 58, has other ambitions for the islands of the Seto inland sea, many of which are underpopulated and accessible only by patchy ferry services. The businessman, who owns an international chain of English-language schools, hopes to open a museum on Inujima - which he also owns - and then tackle the aesthetic wasteland of Teshima, for years an illegal dump for industrial waste. </p> <p>There is every chance he will succeed. The number of visitors to Naoshima has risen steadily in the past decade, and his collaboration with Ando and contemporary artists around the globe has placed his \"art space\" mission firmly in the minds of the cultural cognoscenti. However, there are signs that art appreciation and tourism still have differences to resolve. </p> <p>No photographs can be taken and visitors hoping to take notes are asked to put their ballpoints away and use specially provided pencils lest they suddenly get the urge to try their hand at graffiti. </p> <p>There are conservative limits on the number of people allowed into the galleries at one time, and the marketing campaign, though professional, smacks of elitism. Chichu has not, for instance, approached large travel agencies or advertised itself at the mainland ferry terminal. \"People will find out about it,\" said the museum's curator, Kayo Tokuda.</p>",
  "<p>No one wants to be prime minister when they grow up, and more children dream of becoming a builder than a pop star.</p> <p>A poll of 3,000 nine to 15-year-olds, carried out by Woolworths, showed that a fifth wanted to work as builders when they grow up, as it would mean working outside and earning lots of money. </p> <p>Becoming a pop star was second favourite, with 17% of children saying they wanted to be singers, while 15% of children wanted to become actors.

  "An Anglican bishop today claimed a popular hymn, which was sung at princess Diana's funeral, was \"heretical\" and had racist overtones. <p>The Rt Rev Stephen Lowe, the Bishop of Hulme, Manchester, said he would not sing I Vow To Thee, My Country, or lead a service in which it featured, \"despite the good tune\". </p> <p>Writing in a diocese newsletter, the bishop expressed unease about growing English nationalism, which he said was stoked by football fervour, and \"a wish for a white-dominated simple world of Englishness\".</p> <p>He called on clergy to think \"long and hard\" about singing the hymn because its lyrics proclaimed love for country \"which asks no question\". This, he argued, was not the Christian way.</p> <p>Writing in Crux, the newspaper of the Manchester diocese, Bishop Lowe said \"I will not sing [it] ...

Now, he said, it was right to be critical. </p> <p>The words to the hymn, which is set to music taken from the Planets, by Gustav Holst, were written by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice.</p> <p>Bishop Lowe's article said that, \"on one level\", the plethora of St George flags during the Euro 2004 football championship was \"probably harmless\", and represented a welcome move \"to re-establish a national English identity\". </p> <p>However, he added that he was \"very uneasy\" about growing nationalism, with the tournament being played at the time of a \"vicious anti-European campaign\", the rise of Ukip, and xenophobic attitudes towards other countries in the British tabloid press. </p> <p>\"Any notion of national superiority or fierce independence while pouring scorn on our neighbours is profoundly un-Christian and wrong,\" he wrote. \"We need to be very careful.\"</p> <p>He added that \"undergirding\" a rise in nationalism was a \"wish for a white-dominated simple world of Englishness where a pound and not euros ... reign supreme, and we don't have to engage with the mongrel nature of our world\".</p> <p>According to the Daily Telegraph, Bishop Lowe claimed the rise in English nationalism had parallels \"with the rise of Nazism\". </p> <p>Later, he told Sky News that the paper had misreported him when it said he had called for the hymn to be banned.</p> <p>His article also expressed reservations about the recent D-day commemorations which, \"although moving and important\", had left him \"wondering whether some still hanker after a world where some nations are baddies and others alright, and we are the triumphant upholders of the right values\". </p> <p>He criticised George Bush's US administration, saying that the US had \"pride that borders on arrogance\". The US, he said, proclaimed its own rightness while threatening the future of the world by \"its gas-guzzling attack on the world environment\". \"I find this uncritical sense of superiority coming from the United States about its values and way of life one of the most frightening aspects of global life,\" he wrote.</p> <p>However, he added that, despite his fears over rising British nationalism, he would still be supporting the England football team. \"I want 'Engerland' to win again one day and to celebrate the victory for a couple of days - maybe even by waving a flag,\" he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Church of England said the bishop was entitled to his own opinions. </p> <p><b>I Vow to Thee, My Country: the words</b></p> <p>I vow to thee, my country- all earthly things above<br> Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love<br> The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test<br> That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best<br> The love that never falters, the love that pays the price<br> The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice. <br><br> And there's another country I've heard of long ago<br> Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know<br> We may not count her armies, we may not see her King<br> Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering<br> And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase<br> And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.</p>",

  "<p>Britain was yesterday placed at the forefront of global research into potential stem cell therapies for a range of incurable diseases as the go-ahead was given for the cloning of human embryos. </p> <p>In a controversial move that delighted scientists and infuriated pro-life campaigners, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority gave a team at Newcastle University the first licence to create embryos and extract stem cells from them for research. </p> <p>Scientists believe stem cells - which have the potential to form any of the body's hundreds of different tissue types - hold the key to treating conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and diabetes. But critics said the work is unethical and unnecessary, and warned it could help maverick scientists trying to clone a human baby. </p> <p>Miodrag Stojkovic, from the university's Institute of Human Genetics, said: \"We are ready to go as soon as the paperwork is sorted out. It has taken a year of work, and I am most pleased that the HFEA has recognised the potential of this technology in modern medicine.\" </p> <p>The Newcastle team will use the same technique used to create Dolly the sheep. They plan to insert DNA from skin cells into eggs left over from IVF treatment, which have had their own genetic material removed. Nurturing the eggs for six to eight days produces a tiny ball of around 100 cells, no bigger than a pinhead, from which stem cells can be extracted. </p> <p>If the skin DNA was taken from a diabetic, then, in theory, the resulting embryonic stem cells could be grown into new pancreatic tissue and transplanted back into the patient with no risk of rejection. </p> <p>\"What we want to do is to see if these embryonic stem cells have the ability to differentiate into insulin-producing cells,\" said Dr Stojkovic. The scientists hope to produce the first stem cells within two years, though it could take at least five before any new therapies are tested in clinical trials. </p> <p>Cloning human embryos to make babies is outlawed in the UK, but so-called therapeutic cloning, where the embryo is destroyed after the stem cells are extracted, was made legal under strict guidelines in 2002. </p> <p>Last year the Newcastle scientists became one of the first two groups in Britain to derive embryonic stem cells from spare IVF embryos. It asked the HFEA to allow the cloning research in February. </p> <p>The chair of the HFEA Suzi Leather said: \"After careful consideration of all the scientific, ethical, legal and medical aspects of the project, the HFEA licence committee agreed to grant an initial one year research licence. This is an important area of research and a responsible use of technology.\" </p> <p>The first task for the Newcastle scientists will be to repeat the work of colleagues in South Korea, who announced in February that they had cloned the world's first human embryos and extracted stem cells. The South Korean team used dozens of fresh eggs from volunteers, which are more suitable for cloning than those left over after IVF. </p> <p>Pro-life groups said they were taking legal advice in a bid to overturn the ruling. </p> <p>Jack Scarisbrick, national chairman of the group Life, said: \"The decision is not unexpected given the HFEA's lamentable track record. </p> <p>\"We deplore this further step down the slippery slope. Therapeutic cloning involves the manufacture of a new kind of human being with the express purpose of destroying that life once stem cells have been stripped from it. It is the manipulation, exploitation and trivialisation of human life of a most frightening kind.\" </p> <p>The UN will discuss moves to ban reproductive and therapeutic cloning in October. The UK and others are lobbying for individual countries to be allowed to decide whether to allow therapeutic cloning.</p>",
  "<p>Are you sure they would want to, having seen what happened to the hibernating crews in the films 2001 and Alien? Slumbering the months and years of tedious intergalactic journeys away in a hibernation chamber may be a staple of science fiction, but there is little prospect of real life astronauts doing it in the foreseeable future. Although, strictly speaking, that doesn't create much of a problem because manned missions to any destination far enough away to require it are just as distant. </p> <p>\"A journey to Mars would take two years, maybe more, and hibernating would be a very good way around the fact that it's going to be exceptionally boring,\" says Alyson Calder, a space medicine expert at Monklands Hospital, Airdrie. The idea is very much on the fringes of space research - despite recent media attention- but that hasn't stopped the European Space Agency taking an interest. Through its advanced concepts scheme, ESA is keeping an eye on promising research into hibernation mechanisms, a surprisingly poorly understood phenomenon given its prevalence in the animal world. </p> <p>One approach, taken by a team at the University of Verona, involves an opioid-like substance called Dadle that triggers unseasonable hibernation in squirrels given it as an injection. It also seems to send cultures of human cells to sleep, and the scientists are now testing Dadle in animals that don't hibernate, starting with rats. Others are looking at the Madagascan fat-tailed dwarf lemur, the first primate known to hibernate. </p> <p>Hibernation would not just pass the time for astronauts, it would save on supplies needed for the journey, including food. In turn, this would reduce the weight of the craft and so the amount of fuel needed to launch. </p> <p>But there would be downsides. Sleeping astronauts would be unable to react to emergencies, so they would probably have to hibernate in shifts. It would also stop them performing exercises designed to counteract the effects of weightlessness. \"One way around that would be to fly to Mars in a spinning craft which creates a 1g environment,\" says Calder.</p>",
  "<p>Not physically. Claims this week that each of us have a 35% chance of experiencing an earthquake with \"global reach\", refer to the financial implications of a very specific earthquake. </p> <p>\"Only an earthquake in Tokyo could have a global impact,\" says Bill McGuire, director of the Benfield Grieg Hazard Research Centre at University College London, who arrived at the figure. </p> <p>Tokyo is a special case, because as well as being densely populated, most Japanese companies have their headquarters there. Some 33 million people - a quarter of the country's population - live in Tokyo's metropolitan region. The city sits near the meeting point of three tectonic plates and is close to four major fault lines. Japan could be considered to have a few too many eggs in one basket. </p> <p>In 1923, an earthquake registering 8.3 on the Richter scale hit Tokyo, killing 140,000. Another earthquake there, which is expected within the next 100 years or so, could cause a staggering $3.3 trillion of damage, according to McGuire. </p> <p>\"The worry is that Japan would have to pull out a lot of its foreign investment to finance the rebuilding of Tokyo,\" says McGuire.</p>",
  "<p>It's unlikely. While all manner of drugs can be detected in sewage, and in rivers close to sewage outlets, processing the water appears to destroy any residual traces. </p> <p>Media reports this week claimed that the Environment Agency had found significant levels of the antidepressant Prozac in drinking water, amounting to what some referred to as \"mass medication\". But the Environment Agency says it has never looked at Prozac. Instead, it attributes the work to Norman Baker, a Liberal Democrat MP with a long-standing interest in the issue. </p> <p>\"There is no research that shows Prozac is in water. There's no analytical data at all,\" says Tony Lloyd, who runs the water research programme at the Drinking Water Inspectorate. The drug's chances of remaining intact through someone's body, the sewers and then the water treatment system, which is designed to break down persistent pesticides, are negligible, he says. \"Prozac is a biodegradable molecule, and while you would expect people to be excreting it and you'd expect it to be in the sewers, you wouldn't expect it to get through sewage treatment.\" </p> <p>The Drinking Water Inspectorate doesn't test water for all drugs, but it has looked at whether steroids used in contraceptive pills - considered among the most resilient of drugs - survive the water treatment process. Their equipment, which can detect one nanogramme of drug in a litre, found no traces in drinking water. </p> <p>Drugs in water courses could be a problem for wildlife. A study by the Environment Agency found significant levels of the painkiller Ibuprofen, but concluded that none of 10 drugs detected was a threat to fish or waterborne insects.</p>",
  "Sweeping changes to police powers were proposed by the government today, with officers in England and Wales to be permitted to arrest suspects for any offence, rather than only those which attract prison sentences. <p>The idea, included in a consultation paper published today by the Home Office - just two days after the Conservatives made a series of hardline crime and order proposals - could be on the statute books by next summer.</p> <p>But civil rights campaigners have already branded the idea of arresting people for offences such as graffiti and dropping litter \"disproportionate\".</p> <p>The 30-page consultation paper also raises a series of other proposals, including roadside fingerprinting, extending search warrants to cover all properties connected to a suspect, and greater powers for community support officers (CSOs).</p> <p>The police minister, Hazel Blears, said the moves would \"maintain the crucial balance between the powers of the police and the rights of the individual\".</p> <p>However, the director of civil rights group Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said of the arrest proposals: \"When you create a broad, unnecessary power there is a danger of arbitrary and racially discriminatory use. </p> <p>\"This comes just a couple of weeks after statistics showed a 300% rise in the number of Asian people being stopped and searched. </p> <p>\"The Home Office says the detail will be set out in guidance - an approach which has failed as far as stop and search is concerned.\" </p> <p>\"If powers are truly needed then parliament should debate them and perhaps pass them. </p> <p>\"But I have yet to hear any serious voice in policing in this country say that the problem the police faces is that they don't have powers to arrest people for dropping litter,\" she told Radio 4's Today Programme.</p> <p> She added: \"In a democracy you do not create extremely broad powers and say they will not be used in practice - you give the police powers they actually need. </p> <p>However, Ms Blears insisted that a \"necessity test\" would ensure that not all suspects were arrested for petty crimes.</p> <p>\"What we are saying here is that in future all offences will be arrestable but that does not necessarily mean that everybody will be arrested, because there will be a necessity test,\" she told the BBC.</p> <p>\"A constable could come upon an offence and he might not be sure whether it is arrestable or not. In future that would be very clear. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"Today's announcements are just another headline-grabbing initiative from a gimmick-crazy home secretary. </p> <p>\"We agree with the efforts to make the definition of arrestable offences simpler. But will we now find ourselves in a crazy situation where a litter lout is arrested and a cannabis smoker is not? \"Every arrest brings with it reams of paperwork,\" he added. \"The government is in danger of encouraging police to make arrests based on their heavy workload of paperwork and not on the seriousness of the offence.\" </p> <p> The new principal speaker of the Green party, Keith Taylor, dismissed the proposals as the \"latest in a series of attacks on civil liberties\". </p> <p>He said: \"This government already monitors its citizens more closely than any in Britain's history.</p> <p>\"The power to arrest on the suspicion of even the most minor offences undermines the fundamental right to go about one's day-to-day business without interference from the state. </p> <p>\"As with current stop-and-search procedures, there is also the risk that these new powers could be disproportionately used against members of certain communities.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>The consultation period ends in October, enabling the government, if it wishes, to table bills based on the proposals in a November Queen's speech.</p> <p>The paper - entitled Modernsing Police Power to Meet Community Needs - also suggests giving CSOs greater powers to direct traffic, tackle beggars, search people for weapons and enforce bylaws, leaving police officers free to concentrate on frontline duties.</p> <p>It also proposes that CSOs - who can already issue \u00a340 on-the-spot fines for being drunk and disorderly - be given extra powers to deal with drunks and underage drinkers. </p> <p>The proposals, which originate with the Home Office rather than the police forces, were given a guarded welcome by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p> <p>The association's vice-president, Denis O'Connor, said: \"There is undoubtedly a need to rationalise some of the powers we currently hold and strengthen those we need most. </p> <p>\"We are supportive of the government's effort to enhance the powers of the wider police family, particularly CSOs, enabling them to assist the police in tackling crime and disorder.\"</p> <p>He added: \"However, we would sound a note of caution at any major extension of powers for CSOs before the Home Office evaluation is complete.\"</p> <p>The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers and is opposed to the expansion of the role of CSOs, gave the proposals a lukewarm reception.</p> <p>Its vice chairman Rod Dalley said: \"Any use of or change in police powers should be taken seriously. </p> <p>\"Therefore we will carefully consider the Home Office paper and will be engaging fully in the consultation process. </p> <p>\"In particular we will be closely examining any proposals to extend the powers given to CSOs in view of the fact that no evaluation of their role has taken place.\" </p> <p> <b>Other proposals include:</b> <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Testing people arrested for property crimes for class A drugs.<br> <b>\u00b7</b> New powers to fingerprint suspects at the roadside and to take DNA samples and footwear impressions. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Allowing police to take DNA and fingerprint samples covertly - for example, by undercover officers - to determine identification of suspects and their possible involvement in an offence, although such material would be for intelligence use only and not as evidence in court. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Allowing revenue from motoring fixed penalties to fund automatic number plate recognition systems, which are already in use in 23 forces in England and Wales. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Removing the requirement for civilian investigators to wear a uniform, so that they can go \"plainclothes\" if required. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Allowing the courts to remand in police custody anyone suspected of swallowing parcels of drugs - possibly for as long as 12 days - to allow the drugs to be passed and seized as evidence.<br> <b>\u00b7</b> Create a new offence of \"keeping an incorrectly registered vehicle\" to tackle the problem of an estimated 1.2 million untaxed, unsafe or uninsured vehicles on Britain's roads. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Giving police a new power to stop, search, seize and confiscate fireworks where they suspect the items are held illegally under the Fireworks Act 2003 - which made possession by under-18s illegal. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Possible new legislation to deal with demonstrations outside parliament. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> Allowing officers to photograph suspects outside the police station, and use moving images such as video.</p> <p> </p>",
  "<b> Life before</b> <br> <p> I don't think it really sank in that I was a father until I realised, a few weeks after Esme's birth, that different television adverts were now attracting my attention. Whereas Jane may have noticed she had become a parent after delivering seven pounds of baby girl, it took an advert for a Renault Espace to ignite my spark plugs. </p> <p>Laying on the sofa one night with Esme asleep on my chest, I watched a cavernous people carrier being loaded up with kids, parents, pushchairs and shopping. One thought crossed my mind: \"We really need one of those.\" </p> <p>In a moment, I slipped effortlessly into the demographic category so prized by marketeers - the aspirational parent. Jane was a few months ahead of me on this one too, and had already ordered me into the spare room, telling me not to leave until it had been magicked into The Nursery. Precious weekends were thus spent whitewashing walls, traipsing around John Lewis weighing up baby baths versus bathing seats, and seemingly ordering everything ever made by JoJo Maman B\u00e9b\u00e9. We had a bad case of what is known as FCS, or First Child Syndrome. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> The ethical audit</b><br> </p> <p> The auditors: <b> Hannah Berry</b>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <b> Mike Childs</b>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <b> Renee Elliott</b>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops. </p> <p> Hannah, Mike and Renee step into Esme's nursery and immediately gravitate towards the \"changing station\". Mike isn't surprised by the amount of baby paraphernalia on show. </p> <p>\"In our consumer-led society, babies have become the champion consumers,\" he says. \"There is a special baby product for every occasion and parents are encouraged to buy. Because we want our children to be well cared for and safe, we are particularly receptive to the message. But you don't always need brand new things for your baby. Babies grow so quickly that they rarely wear out their clothes - or other baby equipment such as baths, cots and pushchairs. Talk to friends and family to see if they have baby stuff you can use - and then pass on your things to friends when you don't need them any more.\" </p> <p>Hannah seems more concerned, however, with the potential sources of toxins in the room. \"The nursery was obviously freshly painted in preparation for Esme's arrival and a new carpet laid. But artificial fibre carpets of this sort are not generally recommended for small children as they can contain traces of dangerous compounds such as brominated flame retardants.\" </p> <p>This is a big issue for Mike, too. You must try at all costs to avoid products with synthetic materials, he says. \"Babies and toddlers are particularly vulnerable to the effects of certain chemicals in the environment, and yet toiletries for babies often contain chemicals which are known to disrupt their hormone systems, or to build up in body fat. Plain old-fashioned water rather than these wipes usually does the job of keeping your baby clean. Avoid perfumed creams and lotions, too, as these often contain dodgy chemicals, and take care with plastic bottles, feeding cups and feeding bowls. These have been found to leach harmful chemicals when their surfaces become scratched.\" </p> <p>Jane and I know we are going to receive a mauling for using disposable nappies. So Jane holds up one of Esme's Pampers and invites the castigation to begin. </p> <p>\"The nappy question poses many ethical dilemmas for the modern parent,\" says Mike. \"You have opted for convenience at the expense of the environment. Disposable nappies are a major waste problem, with eight million nappies thrown away every day in the UK. Ninety per cent of these end up in landfill. Disposable nappies can even make up half the contents of a family's bin. You should try using reusable terry nappies instead. You may find this is not practical all the time, but you will save money. The Women's Environmental Network estimates that using terry nappies instead of disposables can save \u00a3500 over the nappy-wearing lifetime of a child.\" </p> <p>Funnily enough, say Jane and I, the thought of battling with big safety pins and having large pots of soiled nappies on the boil doesn't really appeal. </p> <p>\"Washable nappies have come a long way from the days of terries and pins,\" replies Renee. \"They are easier to use, don't clog our landfills and, as Mike says, save you money. Companies such as Green Baby offer a large range and sample packs are available so you can try a few before buying in bulk. When you do need disposables for the quick and easy solution, you should make an effort to avoid the nasty chemicals that you find in most ordinary disposables. Artificial chemical absorbents such as sodium polyacrylate form a gel that can end up on your baby's skin as well as in the earth. There are nappies available, such as Tushies, which are gel-free, perfume-free, dye-free and latex-free. Importantly, they work. They also have wipes that are both hypoallergenic and alcohol-free.\" </p> <p>Hannah is keen to move on to the topic of the multinationals. She pulls out the bumper pack of Pampers underneath the changing station. \"Procter &amp; Gamble, the makers of Pampers,\" she says, \"has been criticised for conducting animal experiments for the development of pet food although it does claim to be committed to eliminating the need for all animal testing of products and ingredients for human use.\" </p> <p>Mike is looking through the pile of toys on the floor. \"Steer clear of plastic toys that Esme may put in her mouth,\" he says, \"especially if they're scratched or damaged. Manufacturers can no longer use plastic softeners called phthalates in teething toys for babies, but children do not always discriminate about which toys they are going to chew.\" </p> <p>Renee explains why it is so important to avoid phthalates. \"Studies are showing links to cancer and kidney damage, and scientists think it may interfere with development and the reproductive system. </p> <p>We should always check where toys are made before buying them, adds Hannah. \"Try not to buy toys made in China, where inhumane manufacturing conditions are widespread. Mattel, Disney and Hasbro were among the many companies named in a 2002 expos\u00e9 of Chinese toy factories, which found mandatory all-night 20-hour shifts, inadequate ventilation, and wages generally way below legal minimums.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Life after</b><br> </p> <p>Like all parents, we thought we had done everything we possibly could - bought everything our baby requires, attended antenatal classes, created a cosy nursery, exclusively breastfed her, read all the books. So when we hear that the surroundings we have lovingly created contains toxins, and furthermore, the manner in which we are raising her is bad for the environment, we are left reeling and somewhat dejected. </p> <p>It is not until a few days later that we raise the subject again. We both agree, though, that the first thing to do is change Esme's nappies. The thought of their effect on the environment concerns us, but, to be honest, we are also attracted to the idea that washable nappies are considerably cheaper than disposables. A friend puts us in touch with the local \"nappy lady\" and shortly we receive a delivery of sample nappies. I had not realised that they could come in so many shapes and sizes. All are made from brushed-cotton terry towelling but with a variety of fastening devices - poppers, Velcro, clips. My fears of fighting regular battles with safety pins and squares of muslin cloth evaporate. </p> <p>A day or so later, and we have a bucket full of soiled nappies waiting to be washed. On the recommendation of the nappy lady, we have been sprinkling a few drops of tea-tree oil in the bucket to keep down the pong. </p> <p>We stuff all the nappies, liners and wraps into the washing machine and wash them at 60C as opposed to the 40C that the ethical auditors have asked us to stick to for normal washloads. It's our thought that having smelled these nappies 60C is the very least they should be washed at if they are to be cleaned thoroughly. An hour later, once the wash has finished, we examine the nappies closely, to see if all the stains have gone and, thankfully, it seems they have. </p> <p>About a week later, we settle on nappies made by Mother-Ease, as the poppers are the easiest to use and the nappies fit snugly. So we go ahead and order 20 more at a cost of about \u00a3200. Considering that disposable nappies can cost upwards of \u00a31,000 in a baby's first year, we justify this as a long-term investment. We are comforted further when we ask the nappy lady how long they can be expected to last and she says each will take at least two children through to potty training. </p> <p>With Esme sleeping through for about 12 hours at night, however, the washable nappies simply get too wet for our satisfaction and we opt instead for a disposable at night. We try some \"eco-disposables\" but they still don't seem to do the job so, with heavy hearts, we keep using conven-tional disposables. However, we console ourselves by noticing that the amount of nappies we throw into the wheelie bin is now down to single figures for an entire week compared to the dozens we tossed out before. </p> <p>An area we have less success with is plastic toys.

  "For the past four years, Victor Malarek has immersed himself in the world of pimps, traffickers, rapists and some of the most disenfranchised women and girls in the world. One of Canada's leading investigative journalists, he is the author of a new book about the global sex trade, The Natashas, a harsh introduction into a business that causes uncalculated misery to hundreds of thousands of young women. <p>The title refers to the generic name given by customers to the women and girls trafficked across international borders every year; the US state department currently puts this figure at around 900,000, most of them from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Malarek estimates that trafficking in women generates about $12bn (\u00a36.6bn) a year, making it the third largest money-making venture in the world, after trafficking in weapons and drugs. </p> <p>Malarek's book takes us to auctions in Bosnia, where women are displayed naked on wooden crates to be poked and prodded like livestock. He hears stories of rape, abuse and torture on a shocking scale. But he avoids repeating what counter-trafficking activists already know, and what has been said many times before - that these women deserve our pity and compassion. There have been countless international events set up to address the issue of trafficking, but in Malarek's view the focus has been too much on the women forced into it, and not enough on the traffickers themselves, the perpetrators of the crime; there has been too much hand-wringing, and not enough action and enforcement. \"We have spent millions researching the causes,\" he says, \"and on international talking shops drawing up action plans and new legislation. But unless we implement these laws, and give police more money to investigate and prosecute the pimps, we will get nowhere.\" </p> <p>The Natashas is an angry, impassioned book, for which Malarek makes no apologies. He describes the people who buy and sell women as \"low-life criminals\", \"gutter trash\" and \"heartless goons\". He does not make a distinction between \"forced\" and \"chosen\" prostitution - as many campaigners in the field do - but outlines the human rights abuses evident in the sex industry per se. He also identifies customers as a large part of the problem. \"Let's look at how societies can discourage men from buying these women,\" he says, \"which would reduce the supply. Some people justify prostitution by saying, 'It's the world's oldest profession.' I say there are ways to stop this. Trafficking is an easy crime to solve. If I can find the brothels and traffickers, so can the police. Just look in the tabloid personal advertisements for a start.\" These men are not looking for relationships, he says. \"They want sex with a faceless female. Those who use trafficked women want to pretend that they are not like their sisters, mothers or partners.\" </p> <p>Born in Lachine, Quebec, in 1948, Malarek was taken into care when he was nine, and grew up in a children's home. Before that, he regularly witnessed his father beat his mother in fits of drunken rage. As a teenager, he spent time in juvenile correction centres for petty crimes, but then decided to turn his life around and got a job as a copy boy on a Montreal magazine. </p> <p>A front-page story for the Montreal Star in 1971 about the suicide of three boys in a Canadian correction centre launched him as a serious investigative reporter. He has since become a passionate advocate for the abused and the marginalised, writing books about Canada's immigration policy and drugs trade, as well as hosting a television documentary series, The Fifth Estate. \"As a writer, I have always relied on my gut,\" he says. \"If I feel a story is important, I will go all out to expose it.\" </p> <p>When Malarek began research for The Natashas in 2000, journalists in Canada and elsewhere were by and large uninterested in the subject. \"I would see stories coming in through the wires about the abduction and mass rape of Moldovan, Russian and Bosnian girls, but no one was following them up. I decided it was something I could not ignore,\" he says. </p> <p>Focusing mainly on trafficking from the former Soviet Republic, Malarek examines the role of the Russian mafia, as well as the Albanian, Israeli, Czech, Serbian, Hungarian and Ukrainian gangs involved in international pimping. He reserves his fiercest criticism for those EU countries that have gone some way toward legalising prostitution in the belief that it will alleviate illegal elements within the sex trade. Governments should come down hard on criminals, he says, not improve their working conditions. </p> <p>\"Countries like the Netherlands and Germany [which have legalised 'off-street' prostitution] should hang their heads in shame,\" he says. \"They should walk into the UN building with their flags held at half-mast for what their policies on the sex trade have done to thousands of young women. Traffickers have been given a red carpet to walk on in those countries.\" </p> <p>His no-tolerance stance is not shared by some in the UK. Liverpool city council will seek Home Office approval for a \"managed zone\" for street prostitutes this November, and last month shortlisted two industrial estates as possible sites. The council maintains that a common area for women to work will improve their safety, as well as give them access to health and support networks; it is also popular with residents who do not want prostitution on their doorsteps. But similar zones have been established and subsequently closed down in the Netherlands because of an increase in trafficked women being brought to the area, along with high levels of violence and drug abuse. </p> <p>The Natashas also examines the complicity of some members of the international community based in the Balkans, where trafficking is a growing problem. In 2002, an employment tribunal heard how Kathryn Bolkovac, a UN police officer, had been sacked after revealing that colleagues were involved in the sexual abuse of women and young girls in Bosnia. The American security firm she worked for, DynCorp, was ordered to pay Bolkovac \u00a3110,000 in compensation for unfair dismissal, and three men concerned were fired but never charged. (The UN itself is powerless to prosecute, and it is up to member countries to take further action.) During the employment tribunal, the court heard that one of the men had bought a young girl for $700 and kept her in his apartment for sex. </p> <p>In Bosnia, Malarek met a 15-year-old girl who had been trafficked to Bosnia. \"She was the 21st birthday present for one of a [UN] platoon and was raped in turn by men with American, Canadian, British, Russian and French accents - so many she stopped counting,\" he writes. Malarek describes the traffickers' recruitment methods. An orphanage in Romania might receive a visit from \"social workers\" offering \"apprentice programmes\" for adolescent girls. The girls are taken away and forced into prostitution. </p> <p>Much of Malarek's anger focuses on the annual US state department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which grades countries with a trafficking problem according to three tiers. Nations fully compliant with the minimum standards in combatting trafficking are graded tier one, while those unwilling and unable to counter the problem are graded tier three. The UK is in tier one, but there are those who believe - Malarek among them - that the grading system is merely another strategy adopted by the US to reward its allies. </p> <p>\"The TIP report was designed to stop the traffickers operating with impunity,\" he says. \"It was supposed to be about having the courage and vision to take a firm and even bold stand. It was supposed to be about leadership and accountability. But despite all the hoopla and sabre rattling, the US has degraded the process to little more than a diplomatic game.\" </p> <p>Earlier this week, protesters in Bangladesh (graded a tier-three country) argued that the report was a means of pressurising the government into deploying troops in Iraq, and only criminalised the poor. \"Poverty is the main cause of human trafficking and the US should look into it,\" said a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Citizens Alliance Against Trafficking . </p> <p>Despite its TIP status, the UK does not have a strong track record in prosecuting traffickers, with the few cases that are brought being investigated mainly by the Metropolitan police. Even with the new legislation introduced through the Sex Offences Act, which has increased the penalty for human trafficking to a maximum of 14 years, traffickers are scarcely deterred by the force of the law. </p> <p>In December last year, Luan Plakici, an Albanian, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for trafficking up to 60 young women from south-eastern Europe into the UK; he was also convicted on counts of incitement to rape, living on prostitution and kidnap. When the sentence was passed, there were gasps of disbelief from police and anti-trafficking activists at the judge's leniency. </p> <p>The court of appeal later increased the sentence to 24 years. \"Ten years is no deterrent,\" says Malarek. \"Traffickers see it as an occupational hazard to go to jail every now and again. What hurts is when you seize their assets - take everything they have and give it back to the women they've abused and the police so they can track more of them down.\" </p> <p>Does he think the situation has got worse? \"There are no new crimes of this nature; just different ways of getting away with them.\" Malarek accuses the UK, and other countries that have thriving sex industries, of turning a blind eye. \"Tolerance is worse than legalisation in a way. It means we can ignore the fact that some countries provide a safe haven for pimps rather than think of a solution. I would say to the UK, 'Legalise prostitution at your peril'. It would be a red light for pimps to operate with impunity, knowing vice is out of the police's hands.\" </p> <p>The Natashas can seem like a hopeless story, the scale of the problem is so vast. But Malarek is not pessimistic. \"What we need is for governments to say, 'Stop this, and stop it now'. I have a daughter, and would do anything I could to prevent her going into the sex trade. I'm proud of this book, and hope to hell it makes a difference. If it prevents just one life being ruined, then it will have been worth it.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Natashas: The New Global Sex Trade, by Victor Malarek, is published today by Vision, \u00a310.99</p>",
  "<p>A rise in advertising at the Sun newspaper has helped to subsidise the cost incurred by the launch of a tabloid edition of the Times, Rupert Murdoch admitted today.</p> <p>While he did not elaborate on the sums involved or make any comment on the exact depth of losses at the Times, he said the cost of launching the tabloid contributed to a fall in operating income at his British newspapers between April and June.</p> <p>Advertising gains at the group were spearheaded by the Sun and were \"more than offset\" over the quarter by an increase in promotional spending and additional costs associated with the tabloid Times, according to the papers' ultimate parent group, News Corporation, which released its four quarter results today.</p> <p>The tabloid Times, which was launched in November, has failed to win over readers as easily as the pioneering Independent, which ditched the broadsheet format completely within eight months of launching a tabloid edition.</p> <p>But the Times has boosted circulation, which was up by nearly 30,000 - 4.7% - to 661,330 over the year ending in June, according to recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p> <p>Reporting its end of year results in New York last night, News Corp said the Sun had been the most successful of its British newspapers.</p> <p>Advertising gains of 11% and circulation revenue growth between April and June at the papers came \"primarily from the Sun\".</p> <p>Operating income was up by 30%, thanks mainly to circulation revenue growth, again mainly at the Sun, which benefited from the restoration of a 30p cover price after a damaging war with the Daily Mirror last year.</p> <p>News Corp said circulation revenue had grown across all four of News International's titles, which also include the News of the World and the Sunday Times.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters last night, Mr Murdoch said News Corp was not considering upping its 35.4% stake in satellite TV company BSkyB in order to take advantage of a big fall in company's share price last week.</p> <p>\"Frankly we have not really considered it,\" he said. \"By historical standards it's certainly very cheap at the moment. But we have not thought about it.\"</p> <p>Mr Murdoch also ruled out reviving his failed idea to launch a global network of satellite operations, but stressed that the parts of his pay-TV empire - which includes BSkyB and the US operation DirecTV - were already working together.</p> <p>\"It would be a very big umbrella and might be too expensive at this time,\" he said of the Sky Global idea. </p> <p>\"We work very well together now and we get benefits and synergies just in terms of knowhow and knowledge, and to some extent co-operation in the buying of set-top boxes.\" </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Parents would prefer their school-leaving children to start vocational training such as building instead of accruing debt at university, according to a new survey carried out by the Federation of Master Builders (FMB).</p> <p>More than 50% of the 400 people questioned thought job-related training, during which children earned as they learned, was a more favourable option than a time-consuming degree with questionable career prospects. A vast 91% said they would prefer the government to spend more money on vocational training than academic study.</p> <p>Ian Davis, director general of the FMB, said: \"Vocational training provides school leavers with a marketable skill which can act as a stepping stone for the more entrepreneurial to set up or run their own business.\"</p> <p>Parents of boys chose building, alongside computer programming, as their first choice of career for their offspring, with teaching and the police force following closely behind. Parents of girls, however, were less keen for their daughters to pursue building, with 41% considering it to be a bad career choice. Parents of girls also considered computer programming to be the most beneficial route for their children to follow, before teaching, journalism and the police force. </p> <p>Davis said a building apprenticeship could lead to a highly fulfilling career. </p> <p>He said: \"Training in these skills can be just the start. One of our members, James Squirrell, started at the bottom, mixing mortar, loading bricks and sweeping up, and seven years later he is running the building firm James Allen Construction, which now turns over \u00a33m a year.\"</p> <p>However Chris March, a senior lecturer at Coventry University's school of science and the environment, said degree courses in construction set students up for a potentially far more lucrative career in the industry.</p> <p>He said: \"We're talking about producing the people who will build the Trafford Centre, not a residential house. They will work on big contracts. The Trafford Centre was worth over \u00a3200m and the Lowry \u00a357m.\"</p> <p>March emphasised that the construction world has moved on, even since the days of the James Squirrels of this world. \"The construction process is now so complex immense transferable skills are needed to be able to manage it,\" he said. \"It is a very different ballgame. If somebody wanted to end up on the board of a major company they wouldn't now start as a joiner.\"</p> <p>The good news for would-be builders and their parents is that graduates in construction disciplines usually have little trouble finding work, and students who have completed an industry placement are even more desirable. Furthermore, the time spent doing any practical experience counts towards a professional qualification. </p> <p>Universities such as Coventry, Salford and Reading now run courses like construction management, building and surveying and architectural design technology, all of which are industry accredited. According to March however, construction-related courses are generally under-subscribed across the country in spite of the outstanding career prospects.</p>",

  "Appe al court judges yesterday defied human rights campaigners by ruling that British courts could use evidence extracted under torture, as long as British agents were not complicit in the abuse. <p>In a highly controversial judgment, the second highest court in the land rejected the appeals of 10 men suspected of having links to international terrorism and currently held without charge in what activists call \"Britain's Guant\u00e1namo Bay\". </p> <p>The court of appeal, sitting in London, ruled that the home secretary was right to hold the men in two high- security prisons and a high- security psychiatric hospital, and that the special immigration appeal commission (Siac), which backed the internments, was justified in doing so. </p> <p>Two of the men have since returned to their countries of origin but are still appealing. </p> <p>The judgment was immediately condemned as leaving the door open for torture evidence to be used in British courts - and the detainees plan to take their appeal to the House of Lords. </p> <p>Last night Amnesty International criticised the judges for giving a \"green light for torture\". It said: \"The rule of law and human rights have become casualties of the measures taken in the aftermath of September 11. This judgment is an aberration, morally and legally.\" </p> <p>The decision comes just a week after three British men formerly held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay described how after ill treatment they had confessed to meeting up with Osama bin Laden when in fact all three had alibis, confirmed by British security services, that they were in the UK at the time. </p> <p>Ellie Smith, a human rights lawyer at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said: \"It is really dangerous and very worrying that any court is willing to use any evidence that has been obtained through use of torture or ill treatment.\" </p> <p>The decision to allow evidence from foreign torture was tantamount to contracting out the torture. \"We have seen recent instances where the US forces have sent people to other countries for the purpose of extracting evidence,\" she added. </p> <p>The men - all of them foreign nationals and Muslim - are detained indefinitely under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 and do not know most of the evidence against them because it is kept secret in the interests of national security. </p> <p>In their appeals, they argued that to use evidence obtained by torture was \"morally repugnant\", adding that evidence may have been extracted from men detained in both Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Yesterday, one of the judges, Lord Justice Laws, ruled that there was no evidence to suggest the secretary of state had relied on material derived from torture or any other violation of the European convention on human rights. To suggest that it had been was \"purely hypothetical\". He and Lord Justice Pill said that torture evidence could be used in a British court so long as the state had not itself \"procured\" it or \"connived\" at it. </p> <p>The position facing the secretary of state on the use of such evidence was \"extremely problematic\". The law could not expect the secretary of state to inquire into the methods of how information was obtained. </p> <p>Mr Justice Laws said: \"He [the home secretary] may be presented with information of great potential importance, where there is, let us say, a suspicion as to the means by which, in another jurisdiction, it has been obtained? What is he to do?\" </p> <p>The judges unanimously dismissed the appeal but Lord Justice Neuberger dissented on the torture issue. He said he did not consider that a person would have a fair trial if evidence obtained through maltreatment was to be used, particularly since the person giving the statement would not be available for cross-examination. </p> <p>The majority decision was welcomed by the home secretary, David Blunkett. He said: \"There has been a great deal of speculation about the cases put before Siac and whether they relied upon torture. Let me make it clear, we unreservedly condemn the use of torture and have worked hard with our international partners to eradicate this practice. However, it would be irresponsible not to take appropriate account of any information that could help protect national security and public safety.\" </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, solicitor for eight of the men, said: \"This is a terrifying judgment. It shows we have completely lost our way in this country, morally and legally.\" </p> <p>Britain is a signatory to the European convention on human rights which enshrines a series of fundamental rights, including \"freedom from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment\". </p> <p>Facilitating torture elsewhere is also illegal under the convention against torture to which the UK is committed. </p> <p>The lawyer for two other men, Natalia Garcia, said that human rights had become \"a casualty of the so-called war on terror\". She added: \"We have sunk to an all-time low where a court can even contemplate that evidence obtained under torture could be admissible and where there is no attempt to provide any effective remedy against abuse of power. </p> <p>\"This is injustice heaped upon injustice and we shall appeal to the House of Lords.\" </p>",
  "<p>Oil prices were nudging record levels on global markets last night after Iraqi insurgents threatened to blow up the country's key southern oilfields if the Americans launched a full-scale onslaught on the holy city of Najaf. </p> <p>Dealers shrugged off an earlier move by Saudi Arabia to calm global energy markets on a day of frenetic trading that saw fresh concerns about terrorism, the strength of global demand and the future of the Russian oil giant Yukos. </p> <p>\"If the US forces attack Najaf we will blow up the oil pipelines,\" Sheikh Asaad al-Basri, the Basra leader of the Mahdi army militia loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr, told Reuters in the southern city. </p> <p>Fearful that a global energy crisis could eventually lead to a crash in oil prices, the Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi stressed that the oil cartel Opec would act to prevent damage to the global economy. </p> <p>\"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with the other Opec countries, endeavours to ensure the stability of the international oil market and prevent prices from escalating in a way that may negatively affect the world economy or oil demand,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr al-Naimi said Saudi Arabia was pumping 9.3m barrels a day of crude and was ready to tap surplus capacity of 1.3m barrels per day should it be required. Saudi would meet demand for more than 9.3m barrels per day in September. </p> <p>Oil prices fell by a dollar in the immediate aftermath of the Saudi announcement but quickly regained most of the lost ground as traders expressed scepticism about the ability of the Saudis to make good their promise. </p> <p>By lunchtime in New York, the price of US light crude on the futures market was just 10 cents lower on the day at $44.42 and within striking distance of the record $45.04 reached on Tuesday. Brent, the London market's benchmark crude, was up 5 cents a barrel at $41.30. </p> <p>Traders remained convinced that the price would test $50 over the coming weeks. \"Saudi Arabia is trying to jawbone prices down but the market has got too many things to worry about, like the Mahdi army in Iraq,\" said US energy consultant Gary Ross of PIRA Energy. </p> <p>The Saudis stressed that their production facilities were not vulnerable to sabotage, with foreign affairs adviser Adel al-Jubeir saying in Washington that the possibility of a terrorist attack on his nation's oil infrastructure was \"very, very far-fetched\". </p> <p>Yesterday's unrest in the Middle East came as the International Energy Agency said Opec's sustainable spare production capacity shrank to 600,000 barrels a day in July as the cartel raised output to try to contain prices. </p> <p>\"The thin margin of spare capacity held by Opec producers has contributed to recent price strength,\" said the IEA, which is an adviser on energy to 26 industrialised nations. </p> <p>The IEA figures would mean a buffer of less than 1% on the 82m barrels per day world market, compared to about 8% in 2002 when spare capacity in Opec was 6-7m barrels per day. </p> <p>US government weekly crude inventory data to August 6 showed an unexpected drop of 4.3 million barrels, but stocks of 294 million barrels remained 10 million higher than at the same time last year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the latest chapter in the Yukos saga, the Russian oil company - already struggling to pay a huge tax bill and to find funds for production and transport costs - was declared in default yesterday on a $1.6bn loan by its core owners.</p>",
  "Household rubbish recycling rates in England for 2003 were the highest ever at 14.5%, and for the first time the total amount of household waste sent to landfill sites went down, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said yesterday. <p>Despite this the government was still well below its target of 17% for this year and 25% for 2005, with the environment minister, Elliot Morley, complaining that some councils failed to take legal targets seriously, and threatening that the government would take over their responsibilities.</p> <p>His comment is borne out by local authority league tables showing that, where there is the political will, recycling rates of 25% are attainable by many councils. </p> <p>Daventry district council in Northamptonshire comes top with a 44% recycling rate, and is next door to Corby borough council, which has a 4% rate. </p> <p>Sedgefield, in the prime minister's constituency, last year came bottom of the recycling league but managed this year to get out of the bottom 10 by reaching 5%. </p> <p>The City of London came bottom with 1%; the department accepted there were \"special circumstances\", but made no excuses for Liverpool and Manchester, which registered 2%. Mr Morley said: \"Most councils are working hard to improve recycling rates, providing kerbside boxes and expanding the range of waste materials collected, for example. </p> <p>\"But a significant minority are still not doing enough - in some places the national minimum target of 10% has not been reached. But those who do not show a commitment to improve their recycling levels risk intervention by the government to make it happen.\"</p> <p>Many councils now provide boxes for paper, glass, plastic bottles and containers and tin cans. Many are providing recycled plastic bins free to households to compost kitchen and garden waste that would otherwise go in general rubbish. The result has been a spectacular increase in recycling.</p> <p>In other areas, where householders are given no help, the amount of recycling dropped, and one in 10 councils is still below a 5% recycling rate.</p> <p>Jim Harker, vice-chair of the Local Government Association's environment board, said some councils were making excellent progress but others were being squeezed for funds for environmental services and \"a host of new national and EU waste targets\". Gordon Brown's squeeze on council funding came \"at precisely the time councils need more funding to divert waste away from landfill to meet government targets - meaning many councils will have to spend before they can start to save. The inevitable result will be either increases in council tax, cuts in other services, or failure to meet national and EU targets.\"</p> <p><b>The best local authorities...</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Local authority - % recycled material</p> <p>1) Daventry - 44% </p> <p>2) Lichfield - 43% </p> <p>3) Melton - 31% </p> <p>4) Eastleigh - 29%, <br>St Edmundsbury - 29% </p> <p>6) Forest Heath - 28%, <br>Hillingdon - 28% </p> <p>8) Dorset county - 27%, <br>Hampshire county - 27% </p> <p><b>...and the worst</b></p> <p>1) City of London - 1% </p> <p>2) Liverpool - 2%, <br>Manchester - 2%,<br> Sunderland - 2%</p> <p>5) Barking &amp; Dagenham - 3%,<br> Bolsover - 3%,<br> Redcar &amp; Cleveland - 3%,<br> Rochdale - 3%, <br>Tower Hamlets - 3%</p>",
  "Nuclear power is back on the march. Reviled and rejected for 25 years as man's most dangerous and unsustainable fuel source, its friends are now billing nuclear power as the only practical way of countering climate change, oil shocks and landscape destruction in the west. <p>So, is it possible that public opinion is wrong, and that nuclear should be the fuel of choice of the future? </p> <p>Absolutely, says Tony Blair, who last month told MPs that America was pressing Britain to re-examine the case for building a new generation of nuclear power stations. Nuclear must stay on the agenda \"if you are serious about the issue of climate change\". </p> <p>Definitely, says the independent scientist James Lovelock, who has repeated his lifelong support for nuclear energy and recently argued that civilisation is in \"imminent danger\" from global warming and must use nuclear power - \"the one safe, available, energy source\" - to avoid catastrophe. </p> <p>Perhaps, say some of Britain's leading environmental thinkers, who are calling for a debate about whether nuclear needs to be reassessed, and whether it should even be compared to other forms of renewable energy. </p> <p>Electricity generation is responsible for about one third of worldwide greenhouse gases and, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), nuclear power, which provides 16% of the world's electricity, saves roughly 600m tonnes of carbon emissions per year. This is almost twice the total amount the so far unratified global warming Kyoto Protocol treaty is designed to save. </p> <p>On emissions, nuclear compares well with renewables, says the agency. The nuclear power chain, from uranium mining to waste disposal and including reactor and construction emits roughly 2-6 grams of carbon per kilowatt-hour. This, it says, is about the same as wind and solar power, and two orders of magnitude below coal, oil and even natural gas. </p> <p>With world electricity demand expected to increase at least 30% and possibly up to 100% on 1990 figures by 2020, the World Nuclear Association says nuclear is now not just an option but a necessity for survival. \"With carbon emissions threatening the very stability of the biosphere, the security of our world requires a massive transformation to clean energy,\" says Ian Hore-Lacy of the London-based lobby group. </p> <p>But the nuclear industry is almost at a standstill in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. No new nuclear station has been ordered in the US for 25 years, and only one is being built in western Europe, in Finland. Germany, Belgium, Holland and Sweden are to phase out existing plants, and Austria, Denmark and Ireland have stated policies against nuclear. In many other places, including Britain, there is little or no public support. </p> <p>Nuclear has, however, found an important niche market in Asia. Of 27 stations now under construction worldwide, 16 are in China, India, Japan and South Korea. China and India both intend at least to quadruple their nuclear output and have started nine new power plants in the past four years and have 10 more under construction. </p> <p>\"They are going flat out to develop civil nuclear power,\" says Hore-Lacy. \"Brazil is also reviving its plans for nuclear and South Africa is waiting to get the financial go-ahead. If you factor in the carbon, then the economics looks [even] more favourable for nuclear.\" </p> <p>He expects the industry's next big push to be in America and Europe, where growing awareness of climate change is worrying governments committed to cutting emissions. On the back of anti-wind power sentiment voiced by celebrities like David Bellamy and Sir Bernard Ingham, the industry is now working with the Bush administration to persuade governments to commission a new generation of stations. In Britain, the crunch will come in 2006, when the renewable energy strategy will be reviewed. If wind power is found not to be meeting targets then pressure to commission new nuclear stations will be enormous. </p> <p>Nuclear now has powerful advocates around government who say it is the best way to survive climate change. \"One advantage is that the technology is known,\" says Sir John Houghton, former head of the Met Office and the UN's intercontinental panel on climate change, in a new edition of Global Warming, the Complete Briefing. </p> <p>\"They can be built now and therefore contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions ... estimates are that the cost of nuclear electricity is similar to the cost of electricity from natural gas when the additional cost of capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide is added.\" </p> <p>Sir Crispin Tickell, former UK ambassador to the UN, who famously introduced Margaret Thatcher to the environment and has advised governments on sustainable development, has said that the word nuclear was banned from Downing street, but is now being reassessed out of necessity. \"The problems of true cost, safety, proliferation, security, risk and the rest should be examined in a complete overall assessment of nuclear against other forms of renewable energy to lay a proper foundation for debate and future policy,\" he said recently. \"All over the world people have to change their ways and remodel their thinking. Otherwise Nature will do what she has done to over 99% of species that have ever lived, and do the job for us.\" </p> <p>Other environmentalists, traditionally hostile to nuclear, say that growing understanding of climate change is leading them to question old assumptions. \"It's important that environmentalists don't become fundamentalists [just] following the 1970s line,\" says Paul Allen, development director at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth. \"We've got to look at all the arguments. We have to engage in the debate. Nuclear is one of the arguments that must be considered. We should not just write it off.\" </p> <p>Allen says he is not endorsing nuclear, but is trying to keep an open mind. Nuclear costs, he says, must include the security, insurance, decommissioning, long term storage and waste disposal costs, as well as the energy needed to build the plants. \"For me [nuclear] is not a winner, but let's do the calculations,\" he says. </p> <p>Keith Taylor, new joint principal speaker of the Green party, agrees that the worst nuclear disaster would not be as serious as the worst possible climate change. However, he adds that this does not justify using nuclear power, which he says is now subsidised in Britain by \u00a32m a day. \"But no one group has all the solutions,\" he says. \"No one can afford to be dogmatic. It's important to listen to each other.\" </p> <p>The IAEA does not believe that nuclear power can grow fast enough to combat global warming. Last month, as part of the celebrations for 50 years of civil nuclear power, director general Dr Mohamed El Baradei said that even if the global economy grew strongly, nuclear power would only grow about 70% over the next 25 years and its share of world energy would proportionately fall because of the more rapid expansion of other electricity sources. </p> <p>He concluded that for the rural poor in developing countries, off-grid, small-scale, localised renewables are the best power solution, but that nuclear suited the needs of big, expanding cities, and countries with large centralised power generation. </p> <p>But a global nuclear programme, of the scale needed to push its share well ahead of other forms of fossil fuel electricity generation, could cost hundreds of billions of dollars to get up and running and has little likelihood of attracting private finance. Safety fears, a problem since Chernobyl in 1986 and Three Mile Island more than 20 years ago, were highlighted this week when four men died when steam leaked at a Japanese nuclear plant. Officials say no radiation was released from the Mihama plant. </p> <p>Nuclear stations usually take eight to 15 years to build, and almost that long to start repaying their financial and carbon investments. \"The simple solution is that renewables and energy conservation can deliver the cuts immediately,\" says a Greenpeace spokesman. \"All it needs is political will. To start a new nuclear programme would divert political will and money away from renewables, which are proven. The money which would have to be spent developing a new generation of nuclear stations could massively stimulate other forms of renewables.\" </p> <p>Civil nuclear power was barely debated in Britain when introduced more than 40 years ago, and its prospects collapsed almost without public discussion when the financiers saw the figures did not stack up in the 1990s. If governments waving the green flag now try to persuade the public that a new generation of station is needed, then the arguments on both sides will be furious and divisive. </p> <p>Even if nuclear were the best option to tackle global warming, it's likely to fail again on cost grounds, says the Rocky Mountain Institute, the US energy consultant which advises governments and big companies. </p> <p>\"Capital is finite,\" says a spokesman. \"Each dollar invested in electric efficiency displaces nearly seven times as much carbon dioxide as a dollar invested in nuclear power, without any nasty side effects. If climate change is the problem, nuclear power isn't the solution. It's an expensive, one-size-fits-all technology that diverts money and time from cheaper, safer, more resilient alternatives.\"</p>",
  "Why must it always be Sweden?\" groaned Quentin Hogg 40 years ago. Back then, it was assumed that the answer to every British political problem was to adopt the Nordic country's modish practices. The British right was gripped by its post-Suez crisis of confidence, and the left by the Private Eye/John Pilger view that politics was about betrayal in government. Not much has changed since then: political ideologues still want to find salvation everywhere except in their own country. <p>In the 1990s, the Conservative foreign affairs specialist, David Howell, wrote panegyrics about the rise of Asia - until the crash of 1998 and the continuing no-growth in Japan made his arguments look silly. In the 1970s, the Conservatives were obsessed with Europe. Margaret Thatcher won in 1979 and 1983 as a Euro-fanatic urging Britain to adopt continental capitalism as the model to bury British socialism.</p> <p>More recently, the United States has become the only role model for most right-wing intellectuals, as well as some in New Labour. Arguing against the American faction in British politics, those such as Will Hutton and David Marquand tell us that social democratic happiness has been obtained across the Channel. For them, only a lack of faith prevents a Labour government from signing up for their preferred version of a better world to be found beyond our shores.</p> <p>This lack of confidence in Britain and the belief that there is a Harry Potter politics of potions from overseas is a factor in limiting debate about political options. The latest manifestation of this latter-day version of John Osborne's polemic, Damn You, England, are the appeals from Martin Jacques and Philip Dodd, two of the cleverest analysts of the political-cultural changes of their generation, to look east. Forget, England, Britain and Europe; the only future lies in China and India, they say.</p> <p>Yet from abroad the view seems quite different. From European capitals, Britain is seen as rising to the difficult challenges of the global economy and post-deferential multicultural society. Trade unions in Europe are haemorrhaging members. Not so in Britain. Continental health and education systems are facing budget cuts; the reverse in Britain. Mass unemployment dominates political and fiscal choices in Italy, France and Germany. Full employment combined with redistributive fiscal policy allows Britain to be generous across a range of public spending from overseas aid to the explosion of non-metropolitan culture. </p> <p>No other European city or region can match what is on offer at the Edinburgh Festival or the Proms. No other European broadcasting gets close to the BBC for range and excellence. The continental press was almost embarrassing in its praise for the success of Britain's European policy. In contrast to the permanent Europhobia of the tabloids and Euro-cyncism of the London salons, the Paris, Berlin and Madrid papers argue that London is the major influence in shaping the new constitutional treaty, the new job-focused economic thinking and the new foreign and defence policies of Europe. </p> <p>Whenever I am in the US, I find nothing but praise from business for how the NHS relieves employers from paying out ever-increasing health insurance costs. Americans admired Margaret Thatcher but they adore Tony Blair. If I could have a dollar for every American who on hearing my English accent has told me they wished the prime minister was president of the US, I could restore the Labour party's financial fortunes. </p> <p>Neoconservative commentators such as Charles Krauthammer attack Britain's foreign policy positions because we seek joint EU positions on problems like Iran, Kyoto, world trade talks, the international criminal court, and seeing off of US protectionism on steel tariffs. In Washington, Britain is seen as a leading European nation defending EU positions while accepting global responsibilities. </p> <p>Iraq is a continuing problem. Yet opposing the use of force to remove Saddam has not helped other leaders in Europe in terms of domestic political standing. John Kerry has made clear that, far from pulling US troops out of Iraq, he expects Europeans to become more involved in helping the Iraqi people. Labour, as Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson of Renewal rightly point out, did poorly in the European parliament elections. But the ruling parties in France and Germany did even worse in terms of loss of votes, and in Britain the opposition, the Conservatives, did worse than the government. Labour has a problem with renewing the party, but it is far from clear that betraying trade unions and other democrats in Iraq, or big income tax increases, would do the trick.</p> <p>Writing off Labour governments is a condition of being a left intellectual. Bevin and Attlee, as well as Wilson and Callaghan, enjoyed the scorn of the British intelligentsia but still imposed reforms that lasted. But the last three did not bring in a minimum wage, legislate trade union recognition, promote black and Muslim Britons to high office, create a Scottish parliament and government, or abolish hereditary peers. Giddy with what they perceived as success, Labour governments in the last century did not take the threat of a Tory revival seriously, or rein in rhetoric that alienated voters. As a result, premature ejection from power became a Labour speciality. </p> <p>Today, the left is being invited to stop believing in itself and in Britain. We are told that over the horizon there is a country which we should embrace, or ape. According to Lawson and Thompson, around the corner there is a real social democracy which, by ripping apart the present Labour government, will transform Britain for ever. Yet successful democratic left advance in Europe, or under the New Deal in America, has demanded a politics of compromise, confidence and calm belief that solutions can be found from within rather than hope for a model from abroad.</p> <p>To be sure, progressive theory and practice needs renewing internationally. Yet the British left should be more confident in Britain and our capacity to take forward the permanent reformism begun in 1997, which has done much for our nation, and which many in other parts of the world would willingly copy.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Denis MacShane is Labour MP for Rotherham and minister for Europe</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:macshaned@parliament.uk\">macshaned@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Prospects of sharp increases in interest rates over the coming months receded last night after the City saw a reassuring health check on inflation from the Bank of England as evidence that borrowing costs were close to their peak. </p> <p>Fears that the Bank would need to push interest rates up from 4.75% to at least 5.5% were dispelled when it said there were signs of the housing market cooling in response to the progressive tightening of policy since last November. </p> <p>With figures yesterday showing a rise in the government's preferred measure of unemployment, City analysts said the risks of a back-to-back increase in interest rates next month had receded. </p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight, said the Bank's quarterly inflation report was \"significantly less hawkish about the inflation outlook than we expected, and a September rate hike now seems completely off the agenda. </p> <p>\"Indeed, the report suggests that the Bank of England is currently happy with the market's view that interest rates are set to reach 5% by the end of this year and peak at 5.25% in 2005. </p> <p>\"However, much will clearly depend on developments in the housing market over the coming months.\" </p> <p>The Bank's governor, Mervyn King, said at a press conference yesterday that there was evidence that activity and prices in the housing market were beginning to ease. </p> <p>The view of the nine-strong monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates once a month, is that inflation will gradually rise towards its 2% target while growth will slow down next year. </p> <p>\"The committee's central view is that consumption will continue to decelerate in the wake of moderate income growth and a weaker housing market,\" Mr King said. </p> <p>The governor added that the precise path of interest rates would depend on economic developments and that there were \"significant risks\" to its central forecast. It was possible, he said, that inflation might be lower as a result of supply-side improvements to the economy or a sharper than expected slowdown in the housing market. </p> <p>On the other hand, the apparent lack of any spare capacity in the economy and the tightness of the labour market might result in inflation being higher than anticipated. </p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics yesterday provided mixed messages on the state of the labour market. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 13,700 in July to 835,200, its lowest level for 29 years, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 2.7%. </p> <p>Judged by the international yardstick of people looking for work unemployment rose by 27,000 in the three months to June. </p> <p>With 26,000 people dropping out of the jobs market altogether, the labour force survey showed that employment dropped by 53,000 over the quarter. </p> <p>The unemployment rate on this measure, deemed as more reliable by ministers, rose from 4.7% to 4.8%, while the employment rate for those of working age dropped by 0.3 points to 74.6%. </p> <p>Average earnings, closely tracked by the Bank as a guide to inflationary pressure in the labour market, remained unchanged in the second quarter at 4.4%, or 4.2% excluding bonuses. </p> <p>The ONS said job losses continued in manufacturing. Employment in factories in the three months to June stood at 3.37 million, down 102,000 on a year earlier. Higher output and fewer workers meant productivity rose by 5%. </p> <p>Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, said: \"In the face of the relentless fall in manufacturing jobs, firms are driving their staff harder instead of investing in new equipment and training. This is not going to break manufacturing out of the spiral of decline.\"</p>",
  "Government targets for reduced carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere will not be met, and environmental taxes, particularly on road traffic, are falling rather than rising, the Commons environmental audit committee says. <p>The climate change policy is \"seriously off course\" and it is doubtful that even the minimal policies in place are producing the benefits ministers have claimed, it says.</p> <p>The report on the 2004 budget and energy policy says the cost of motoring continues to fall in real terms set against disposal income, and the cost of public transport continues to rise.</p> <p>In consequence carbon emissions from transport have \"moved spectacularly in the wrong direction\" since 1990.</p> <p>Petrol and oil cost the same in real terms as they did in 1974, and the overall cost of motoring is slightly less.</p> <p>Bus travel is 50% more expensive, and rail 70%.</p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, is singled out for particular criticism, because environmental taxes are at the lowest level since 1993.</p> <p>He is accused of running away from the fuel protesters and losing his reforming zeal.</p> <p>Between 2000 and 2002 the real price of petrol fell by 11% while disposable incomes increased by 9%.</p> <p>Despite recent price rises petrol is still 10% cheaper than it was in 2000.</p> <p>The report says: \"Politicians have hardly tried to convince the public that motoring has not become more expensive, and they have failed to make the case for the environmental benefits of taxing fuel to reflect the damage - particularly global warming - which it gives rise to.</p> <p>\"In addition, we firmly believe that the public would respond more favourably if they saw clearly that the increases in duty were being recycled to promote the low carbon alternatives to conventional fuel -such as biodiesel and renewable hydrogen.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"The continued growth in carbon emissions from transport remains one of the most serious problems we face, and the government's commitment to sustainable development will be called into question unless it takes steps to confront the issued.\"</p> <p>The MPs ask for fuel duty and vehicle excise duty for larger vehicles to be increased and the money redirected to low carbon vehicles.</p> <p>They criticise a lack of coherent policy for alternatives such as bio fuels from crops and gas.</p> <p>The government promised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010 but currently expects to achieve only 15%, the report says.</p> <p>The committee believes even that expectation is based on false assumptions. For example, the rate of energy efficiency improvement would have to double.</p> <p>The Energy Saving Trust endorsed the report last night, calling for more taxes and rebates to encourage energy efficiency.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Philip Sellwood, said: \"Government has to take the lead in encouraging consumers to opt for energy efficiency, and we are convinced that tax incentives should play a central role in this.</p> <p>\"We have seen environmental taxes work before - company car tax is one example - but we feel that the government is missing out on other opportunities to introduce fiscal measures.</p> <p>\"Government has a responsibility to discourage consumers, especially those on a low income, from purchasing products that will cost them more over the long term.\"</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry said the MPs were right to highlight weaknesses in the government's approach to green taxes but the employers remained concerned about competitiveness.</p> <p>Its director of business environment, Michael Roberts, said: \"The call for higher taxes on fuel fails to recognise that the UK has the highest level of duty on diesel in the EU.</p> <p>\"This has a real impact on business when moving freight by road.\"</p>"
