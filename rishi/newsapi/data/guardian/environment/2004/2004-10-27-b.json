  "The bitter feud between Robert Kilroy-Silk and the UK Independence party came to a head yesterday when the former chatshow host walked out on his European parliament colleagues and denounced them as \"barmy\". <p>To the delight of the Tories, who had feared that Ukip could inflict severe damage in next year's general election, Mr Kilroy-Silk declared he would remain in the party and try to wrest control of the leadership. </p> <p>Insisting he had pre-empted a move to expel him from Ukip's 12-strong parliamentary group, Mr Kilroy-Silk depicted himself as a moderating force and condemned his former colleagues as extremists. </p> <p>\"I am relieved and happy to leave a group which engaged in barmy politics,\" declared the man who embraced Ukip after being thrown out of the BBC for branding Arabs \"limb amputators\". </p> <p>Warming to his theme, Mr Kilroy-Silk rounded on his former colleagues for urging women to clean behind the fridge and tearing up voting papers on the first day of the new European parliament. </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk also claimed he had been appalled by Ukip's decision to join the same political group in the parliament as the League of Polish Families, which was allegedly anti-semitic and racist. </p> <p>With tempers running high, Mr Kilroy-Silk came within a whisker of being ejected from the parliament's huge chamber for repeated interruptions as MEPs debated the new European commission. Martin Schulz, the German leader of the socialist group of MEPs, accused him of \"political hooliganism\". </p> <p>\"These people who claim to represent the citizens of Europe should be ashamed of themselves,\" he said. </p> <p>Graham Watson, Liberal group leader, apologised for British colleagues \"hurling insults from the back of the hall\". He said: \"I'm quite ashamed that Britain is known for its football hooligans and even more so when I see their political representatives here in parliament.\" </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk was also criticised by his former Ukip colleagues for dividing the party. Nigel Farrage, the leader of the party in the European parliament, said: \"I'm obviously very sad about his resignation. Robert is enormously talented and a great communicator but, if Ukip is to succeed, we have to be a unified team.\" </p> <p>Ukip's leader, Roger Knapman, said he regretted Mr Kilroy-Silk's decision. </p> <p>He said it left Mr Kilroy-Silk's leadership ambitions in disarray. </p> <p>He told PA News: \"He did have talents, particularly in the promotion of the party and of himself. But he has caused us a lot of negative coverage. </p> <p>He added: \"If he can't stand the leadership of the party or the leadership of the group I don't see how he can become the leader of the party.\" </p> <p>But Mr Kilroy-Silk insisted he had committed no offence. </p> <p>\"I can't wait until it's all over,\" he said, accusing the leader of treating Ukip as \"his personal plaything\" and failing to observe due process in moves to expel him. </p> <p>\"I used to belong to an adult political party with proper procedures for imposing discipline,\" he said.</p>",
  "Having already been embroiled in one seriously unethical episode involving tobacco during its first few weeks in office, the Labour government has been far too ready to resort to concealment and covert investigations in a second murky tobacco affair. The first episode involved Labour's exemption of formula one from its proposed ban on tobacco promotion following a \u00a31m donation - and political lobbying - by Bernie Ecclestone, the F1 boss. The second affair, first revealed by the Guardian four years ago, involves allegations that British American Tobacco, the world's second biggest tobacco company, had been colluding in cigarette smuggling on an unprecedented scale in third world countries. <p>The Guardian's revelations, based on a study of 11,000 pages of BAT's internal files, suggested BAT had condoned tax evasion in a global effort to boost sales and attract new smokers. The report was taken up by the Commons select committee on health, which called for a formal DTI inquiry into the allegations. Initially, it looked as though Stephen Byers, the then trade secretary, would set up an inquiry under section 432 of the Companies Act, allowing files to be seized, employees to be questioned on oath, and a final report to be published. But, as we reported yesterday, new documents obtained by the paper now suggest it could have been intensive lobbying by the company, including a breakfast with the prime minister at 10 Downing Street as well as a subsequent private meeting with the trade secretary, that led Mr Byers to reluctantly agree to set up an inquiry under section 447 of the act. Crucially this section prohibits publication of the full findings. </p> <p>There is nothing new about intensive tobacco baron lobbying. Nor is there anything wrong in a major industrial company seeking the support of a trade secretary. But what looks wrong is the breach in a number of important ethical boundaries. It was wrong for the trade secretary to meet senior BAT officials while he was still considering an inquiry into allegations of corporate misconduct. A period of purdah was needed. Important issues were at stake. Where there is misconduct, the DTI holds powerful sanctions including a court application to disqualify the company's directors. It was wrong to take almost four years before announcing a criminal investigation would be unjustified. It was wrong to pursue a confidential procedure, under which only the final decision was published. What was needed was more openness and transparency. Sunshine remains the best disinfectant.</p>",
  "<p>In a world where we cannot deal with all the problems at the same time, we need to ask: what should we do first? This was the question answered by the Copenhagen Consensus, a project that brought together 38 of the world's top economists to set up a list of the global priorities. They looked at the main challenges to humanity, and the many solutions that we already have, analysing both their benefits but also their price tag. By using cost-benefit analysis the expert panel of economists found that HIV/Aids, hunger, free trade and malaria were the world's top priorities. Equally, the experts rated urgent responses to climate change extremely low. In fact, the panel called these ventures \"bad projects\", simply because they cost more than the good they do. </p> <p>Last week, a coalition of environmental and development organisations published a report stating the Kyoto protocol and even stricter policies should be our first priority. Not surprisingly, they criticised the Copenhagen Consensus as \"intellectually corrupt\" with \"bizarre conclusions\" reached through \"intellectual illiteracy\". Such language is often used instead of strong arguments. </p> <p>If you read the coalition's report, it does not show that global warming is where we can do the most good. It simply points out that climate change can have serious, negative impacts. The real question remains: where can we do the most good for our efforts? </p> <p>Here the coalition goes overboard on its claims about global warming. It says climate stability holds absolute precedence over all other is sues, stating: \"A stable climate is something we might now call a system condition for civilisation.\" Without it, \"civilisation is impossible\". Such a gambit is politically savvy - but also incorrect. Let us agree that human activity is changing our climate and that global warming will have serious, negative impacts. Nonetheless, all the information from the UN climate panel, the IPCC, tells us that it will not end civilisation. </p> <p>The coalition tells us that the proportion of hungry people may actually go up by 2015. Yet the fact is that the UN expects the proportion to decline from 17% to less than 12% of the developing world. By 2015, only a very small portion of global warming will have taken hold, and even by 2080, the IPCC expects that the global food production will have increased by about as much as it would in an unwarmed world. </p> <p> I t worries that malaria will rise in a warmer world. This claim has some theoretical validity, but forgets that malaria only persists with poor infrastructure and health care. Actually, throughout the 1500-1800s, malaria was a major epidemic disease in Europe, the US and far into the Arctic Circle. It didn't end because it got colder, but because Europe and the US became richer and dealt with the problem. </p> <p>The coalition tells us that sea levels will rise by some 50cm by 2100 in the highest scenarios. This will clearly cause problems in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh. Yet what it forgets to tell us is that sea levels rose in the 20th century by up to 25cm. Sea level rise in the 21st century will be worse and should not be trivialised, but the IPCC estimates that the total cost of adaptation will be around 0.1% of gross domestic product. </p> <p>The end-of-civilisation argument is counterproductive to a serious public discourse on our actions. We do have a choice. We can make climate change our first priority, or choose to do other good first. </p> <p>If we go ahead with Kyoto, the cost will be more than $150bn (\u00a380bn) each year, yet the effect will first be in 2100, and will be only marginal. This should be compared with spending the $150bn each year on the most effective measures outlined in the Copenhagen Consensus, saving millions of lives. The UN estimates that for just half the cost of Kyoto we could give all third world inhabitants access to the basics like health, education and sanitation. </p> <p>Global warming is a problem. But we need to ask if we can do more for the world if we tackle other issues first. This question addresses the pressing problem of prioritisation head-on. Why did thousands die in Haiti during the recent hurricanes and not in Florida? Because Haitians are poor and cannot take preventive measures. Addressing the most pressing issues will not only do obvious good, but also make people less vulnerable to the effects of climate change. </p> <p>We need to do the best things first. </p> <p> <strong>Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg is the organiser of the Copenhagen Consensus, associate professor in political science at the University of Aarhus, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The chief United States financial watchdog is to force previously unregulated hedge fund managers to register with the agency, amid growing concern about their influence on global markets. </p> <p>The rule was adopted yesterday at a bitterly divided meeting of the securities and exchange commission by a vote of three-to-two. </p> <p>The vote was split down party lines. Chairman William Donaldson had the support of the two Democrat members of the SEC and was opposed by the two Republicans. Treasury secretary John Snow and Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had also fought against the rule. </p> <p>The hedge fund industry has grown rapidly in recent years. The funds are typically aimed at wealthy investors, offering potentially high rewards but with the downside of high risk. </p> <p>They are allowed to use aggressive techniques denied to the regulated mutual fund industry, including short term speculation on bonds, currencies, stocks and derivatives. </p> <p>Because they are aimed at supposedly investment savvy individuals with a net worth of at least $1m, hedge funds have until now escaped scrutiny. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson estimated that the number of hedge funds has increased fivefold in the past ten years. The decision is the result of a review, begun in June 2002. The last time that the SEC had looked at the possibility of reform followed the near-collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund that catapulted the arcane financial funds into the headlines five years ago. </p> <p>Several hedge funds have been implicated in the ongoing scandal in the mutual funds business. </p> <p>The new rule gives the SEC the power to examine hedge fund managers' books. Advisers will be required to give information such as names, addresses and how much money they manage.</p>",
  "Fighters in Congo have raped at least 40,000 women and girls in the past six years, yet the country's crippled health service can offer the victims little help, Amnesty International said yesterday. <p>Although the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo - which led to about 3 million people dying mainly through starvation and disease - was declared at an end in 2003, fighting continued in the east with some horrific rape cases in June this year, says the human rights group's report. </p> <p>Amnesty accuses the government of indifference, and calls for an assessment of health sector needs, a global effort to boost security in the east, and a tougher line against the violence. </p> <p>Only two hospitals in the east could treat sexual violence victims, Amnesty said, and health centres often had no water or even beds. But some of the problems were relatively simple to solve. Marcel Carlos Akpovo, a researcher, said: \"It's the political will which is necessary.\"</p>",
  "The language hasn't changed. To his critics, Ariel Sharon is still a brutal criminal, indifferent to suffering as he bulldozes through his security strategy. To his backers he is a visionary, prepared to take bold steps to protect Israel. <p>But those who historically supported or opposed Mr Sharon through his decades as Israel's most controversial warrior and political leader have swapped places. </p> <p>The prime minister's former allies among the settlers and the land-grabbing right are against him now for the same reason his peacenik opponents of many years rally to his support. </p> <p>They all believe that yesterday's vote in the Israeli parliament backing the removal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip is a historic step that will inevitably lead to the unravelling of his life's work at the vanguard of expanding Israel's colonies and borders. </p> <p>With it, the prime minister may also be realigning Israeli politics by turning his back on the once powerful religious and far-right factions in parliament to emerge as the champion of the centre. </p> <p>Some of his former Israeli critics now go so far as to compare him to Israel's visionary first prime minister, David Ben Gurion. </p> <p>Shimon Peres, the leader of the Labour opposition, believes that the prime minister's \"unilateral disengagement plan\" has set in chain a process that it will be difficult to reverse. \"Once it starts, it will continue. It's the beginning of a journey to a permanent solution with the Palestinians,\" he said. \"Sharon cannot stop it even if he wanted to.\" </p> <p>Mr Sharon has laid out only the beginning of the process - the removal of about 8,000 settlers from the Gaza strip and a small part of the West Bank - but not how he imagines it will end beyond oblique references to creating a Palestinian state and holding on to the major West Bank settlements. </p> <p>The Palestinians fear that the blueprint is the prime minister's earlier vision of an emasculated Arab state on the 42% of the occupied territories placed under Palestinian administration by the Oslo accords and spotted between the sprawling Jewish settlement blocs that divide up the West Bank. </p> <p>The result would be a homeland without control of its airspace, water resources, borders or foreign policy. </p> <p>Cut off by the vast steel and concrete \"security\" fence and wall under construction through the West Bank, it would amount in many people's eyes to little more than a bantustan reminiscent of apartheid South Africa. </p> <p>The Palestinians are keenly aware that while Mr Sharon talks of disengagement, his government is still expanding the major West Bank settlements. </p> <p>\"It's clear that Sharon is using the withdrawal from Gaza to consolidate the occupation of the West Bank,\" said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian cabinet minister. \"There is no reason to see this as a step toward the creation of a viable Palestinian state.\" </p> <p>But some of Mr Sharon's harshest critics say that he has set in motion a process that will force Israel to give up most of the occupied territories. </p> <p>\"No matter what he says about his intentions - he wants to keep the West Bank and all that - basically this move is unleashing a new political dynamic,\" said Yaron Ezrahi, a political analyst with the Israel Democracy Institute. </p> <p>\"What he does has consequences which are unlikely to be what he says he wants to happen. The public wants it and expects it. The rest of the world wants it.\" </p> <p>\"He has made a turn based on the replacement of ideology by reality and necessity. I think he is walking against his own vision and his own ideology because he began to see the reality of the Israeli situation.\" </p> <p>Nearly two years ago, Mr Sharon decisively won a general election over an opposition Labour party committed to unilaterally withdraw from most of the occupied territories. </p> <p>The then Labour leader, Amram Mitzna, offered to take his party into a national unity government under Mr Sharon if the prime minister would commit himself to dismantling just one small Jewish settlement in the Gaza strip. Mr Sharon refused, saying that to do so would weaken Israel's defences. Less than a year later, he announced the disengagement plan that went much further than Labour was demanding. </p> <p>\"Three years ago nobody would have imagined that this government would dismantle settlements,\" said Mr Peres. \"This prime minister and this government began to realise that we have to answer some very serious questions in the domain of demography, in the domain of geography. In 10 years' time we are going to lose our majority in Israel. So we don't have very much time.\" </p> <p>Mr Sharon said as much in his speech to parliament on Monday when he warned that Israel could not claim to be a democracy and go on governing millions of Palestinians who will soon come to outnumber the Jews in Israel. </p> <p>This month, Mr Sharon's chief aide, Dov Weisglass, said the prime minister was also driven by fears that an alternative peace process might be thrust upon him and a realisation that over time even American support for Israel would erode. </p> <p>Mr Ezrahi said Mr Sharon's attempts to paint Israel as a victim rather than a cause of global terror rebounded. \"He realised that the Israeli Palestinian conflict is of great interest to the west as one of the causes of international terror,\" he said. \"In the beginning, when the terror started, everybody on the right was hoping that would actually globalise support for our war against the Palestinians. What it did eventually is to globalise the intolerability of our occupation to the western world. This pressure can only grow.\" </p> <p>Mr Weisglass also told of concerns that growing dissent within the military, particularly the refusal of elite pilots and commandos to carry out what they characterised as immoral operations in Gaza, was tearing at the tight bond between the Israeli public and its army. </p> <p>Mr Peres believes that no Israeli prime minister can resist such pressures and that whether he likes it or not, Mr Sharon will eventually have to re-embrace the US-led \"road map\" to a Palestinian state. </p> <p>The price for Mr Sharon has been to split his own party, possibly irrevocably. Mr Peres believes the prime minister will have to put together a new coalition of centrist parties to remain in power. </p> <p>\"In a very few days the prime minister will have to decide whether to build a new government or go for elections. We are ready for both,\" he said. </p> <p>But Mr Ezrahi believes that Mr Sharon remains the most powerful figure on the Israeli political stage. </p> <p>\"Despite his difficulties, Sharon radiates the kind of power that few Israeli prime ministers have, only Menachem Begin and David Ben Gurion. He is a tragic figure but he's also going to become a kind of heroic figure who was able to see at a certain moment that his life's enterprise was self destructive to what he was trying to achieve,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>She appeared out of the mist like a slatternly vision. The smudge of lipstick she wore was stark against her etiolated skin and her wild, peroxide hair. She pushed a pram inexpertly, as if it were a new toy.</p> <p>A vendor approached her, proffering trinkets. The guidebooks tell you to meet even the most persistent of these street sellers with politeness, lest you incite aggression: she waved him away like a fly. She spotted me on the cafe terrace. \"Do you speak English?\" she demanded in an exasperated twang. Then she continued up the slight incline from the beachfront, not awaiting a response.</p> <p>At first she seemed so incongruous in Asilah, on the Atlantic coast of northern Morocco, she might have stumbled into town through a quantum wormhole from somewhere in Ohio. But, after staying a few more days, I realised she was a fitting introduction to a place that appeared characterised by a certain elastic reality, seemingly manifested in the mist that would periodically obscure the town like a veil.</p> <p>I was in Morocco partly for the beaches. Europeans invade Asilah en masse in the summer but, perversely, the predominantly French and Spanish visitors only seem to want to bathe in the intense heat at the height of the season; as for the Moroccans themselves, they are so glutted with hot weather they dismiss temperatures below 25C. So, although it was still deliciously toasty in late autumn, I had the broad belt of sand stretching apparently endlessly from the town in both directions almost to myself. When the mist rolled in from the ocean - in less than five minutes - the sense of isolation was magnified; the world felt reduced to a 100-metre-wide circle of sand and lapping sea that was occasionally compromised as a figure resolved from the cloud, before dissolving into it again.</p> <p>In the Medina - the old section of town, distinguished, as in most of Morocco, from a colonial new quarter - the fantastical murals that confront you at every turn add to a mildly hallucinatory sheen. Repainted every August as part of Asilah's International Festival - a month of music, poetry and visual art, and the biggest cultural event in the north of the country - these walls of exuberant colour combine with the blues of the sea and sky and the whitewashed Portuguese ramparts to make the whole town appear like an artwork.</p> <p>Crowning the Medina is the Palais de Raisuni, the edifice of Moulay Ahmad El Raisuni, an exemplary figure from picaresque early 20th-century Morocco. A bandit, warlord, would-be philosopher and governor of Asilah, in more or less that order, Raisuni consolidated his position by kidnapping and ransoming prominent Europeans, including Walter Harris, the Morocco correspondent of the Times, with whom he later became friends. His justice was as rough as his rise: he made murderers throw themselves from the glass-walled terrace of his luxurious palace to the rocks 27 metres below.</p> <p>But I get ahead of myself. I did not start my journey in Morocco, or at least not in the country of today. I began in Seville, a part of the old dominion of al-Andalus, which was in turn part of the Moorish empire that also encompassed Morocco. I wanted a gradual introduction to the Islamic world and I also wanted to arrive there in the most civilised and exciting way: by boat.</p> <p>The genius and passion manifested in Seville's 15th century cathedral, or perhaps just its sheer size (it is the largest Gothic church in the world), almost made me want to believe in God. But maybe that should be Allah, for the building exemplifies the appropriation that characterised the struggle between Christian and Muslim worlds in southern Spain. My route had been partly motivated by a foggy notion that the relics of Moorish Andaluc\u00eda might provide evidence of a different theme: that of relative harmony between the two worlds, in contrast to the explosive strife between them now. And it is true that such a balance did exist in architecture, namely in the Mud\u00e9jar style developed by Muslims practising under Christian rule. An exquisite instance of this dialectical form exists next to the cathedral, in the serene tiled courtyards and gardens of the Alc\u00e1zar Palace.</p> <p>But the cathedral itself demonstrates the \"Mine!\", \"No, mine!\" approach to the built environment that is more typical of imperial conflict. The original temple had been an Almohad mosque that was consecrated to the Virgin Mary after Fernando III retook Seville from the Moors, in 1248. A century-and-a-half later, the church decided to build an unparalleled tribute to the greater glory and, on the same site, erected the building that exists today. The former mosque was demolished in the process, save for its minaret, La Giralda, which, converted to the bell-tower of the church, soars above Seville today and has been adopted by the city as its symbol. </p> <p>From Seville, I made my way south. I stopped at Jerez de la Frontera, the eponymous home of sherry, where I took in the sole remaining mosque, out of 18, in the Islamic city, followed, contra-Muhammad, with some bone-dry fino; I dallied in Cadiz, which went into a long decline under Muslim rule but does have rather nice beaches; and, in Algeciras, one of the great port conduits between Africa and Europe, I paid my \u20ac23 for a ticket and embarked one of the booming ferries that ply the strait to Morocco 10 times a day.</p> <p>In Asilah, hardly had the displaced American wandered on when a young, well-groomed Moroccan man sat down at the table next to me, smiling, and asked: \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" Yes, I replied. Had I seen that woman, he asked, the American? Yes, I had. Well, he said, she was staying with him - she was the new wife of a friend of his, an Algerian, and he had agreed to put her up - and she was crazy! She let the baby play in the dirt and had left a bottle of whisky open on the table: this last he would not have. I tell you what, he said, smiling again, would I like to come back to his place - now - and have a look? A pause. No? Well, here was his number, and his name, Mostafa, in case I wanted to catch up later.</p> <p>The Eurythmics song began playing in my mind again: \"Some of them want to abuse you/Some of them want to be abused/Everybody's looking for something.\" The lyrics were looping, not just because, along with motley other 80s chart-toppers, the song was a staple in the cafes but because it was so apt: one wonders whether Annie Lennox had been spending time in Morocco. For I have been keeping something back: as soon as you step foot on Moroccan soil, a swarm of hustlers, touts and assorted conmen will form about you and prove as difficult as mosquitoes to shake off.</p> <p>I had fled Tangier for Asilah because of them but, despite their supposed concentration in the cities, they were just as numerous there. Crossing the continent to reach the beaches on the other side, I passed through Fez and found the ancient metropolis thick with thieves (one of whom casually conned me out of 200 dirham). I am not suggesting the authorities follow the example of the great, and greatly cruel, sultan Mawlay Ismail and skewer a few hustlers' heads on Bab Mahrouk, pour decourager les autres, but the brigade touristique is decidedly not doing its duty.</p> <p>Only in Al Hoceima, on the Mediterranean coast, was I spared the Moroccan chancer's distinctive cry - \"Hello, my friend.\" Here, as at Asilah, you are likely to share the town beach, Plage Quemado - a yellow curl like the Islamic crescent, bounded by two cliffs and the placid, aquamarine sea - with at most a handful of other bathers at this time of year. The beaches at Asfiha, Torres de Alcala and Kalah Iris, all within an hour's drive, are even more sparsely peopled.</p> <p>Drinking th\u00e9 \u00e0 la menthe, haggling over leather goods and swimming, the days passed easily at Al Hoceima. A mystery was even solved: female Moroccans do dip. Two young women came down to the beach early one morning, in hijab, as is customary, from head to ankle. After elaborate contortions, they stripped down to only about three times as much as western women wear to swim and took to the ripples.</p> <p>To complete my circuit of the north, I had to travel through the Rif Mountains. Morocco is the world's leading exporter of marijuana, and this is where most of it is grown. The Rif has always been a lawless region, and $2bn annually in drugs revenue has not made it any more compliant; gangsters, like the cannabis plants, are everywhere. A certain liquidity on my part on the eight-hour bus-ride through the region was, then, not solely down to the stomach bug I had picked up at the last greasy spoon in Al Hoceima. Especially avoid getting off the bus in Ketama, right in the middle of the Rif, where all the deals are done; you can see how heavy its inhabitants are through the window.</p> <p>Back in Tangier, I took a boat to Gibraltar, as, in the 8th century, did Tariq ibn Ziryab, the invading Moor who gave the Rock its still recognisable name: \"Jabal Tariq.\"</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Simon travelled with <a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">British Airways</a> to Seville. Prices start from \u00a370 or to Gibraltar from \u00a3117 (both prices include taxes).</p>",
  "<p>In Europe the impact of next week's presidential election will be felt directly - the countries of \"old\" and \"new\" Europe will react very differently to the result - and indirectly on the EU's relations with the middle east, central Asia and Africa.</p> <p>Emil Kirchner, professor of European studies at Essex University, sees the possibility of a surprising amount of cooperation in a second Bush term - but also the potential for even deeper splits, notably over Iran.</p> <p>Europe is divided over President George W Bush, with the \"new Europe\" of former Soviet bloc countries like Poland and the Baltic states much more favourably disposed towards him than France, Germany and (since this year's election) Spain.</p> <p>The European security strategy adopted at a summit last September is clearly at odds with the Bush policy of pre-emptive force, Professor Kirchner points out. Europe's recipe for dealing with conflict is \"pre-emptive engagement\" - the use of diplomatic, economic and political tools to head off conflict rather than getting your retaliation in first. Iraq is the most glaring example of how the US and its European allies - apart from Britain of course - have fallen out over this. \"Europeans would feel there would be continuous clashes with Bush at the helm unless he learns from Iraq and changes policy.\" </p> <p>He may learn something different from Iraq, of course. If, as expected, Colin Powell steps down from the State Department, the influence of Donald Rumsfeld and the vice-president, Dick Cheney, could grow and a successful assault on Faluga might reinforce their belief that force is working and could be applied to Iran, the other member of the \"axis of evil\". The question of how to deal with Iran could strain relations with Europe further. Even Tony Blair would find his loyalty stretched if a future Bush administration opted for military measures there.</p> <p>Professor Kirchner doubts whether president John Kerry would change policy radically but he would be viewed more favourably. \"At least there would be a feeling that we have a fresh start and we're not dealing with the same adversary.\"</p> <p>In his view Kerry would try for a more multilateral approach but he would be unlikely to back the Kyoto agreement on global warming or the international criminal court. Professor Kirchner, who has lived and taught in the US, adds: \"I don't think the American character will change. The 9/11 attacks have done something to their psyche that will carry on for some time.\"</p> <p>It's not clear whether the Poles and other east Europeans are pro-Bush or simply pro-American, and in any case their involvement in Iraq could have repercussions on the incumbent president's popularity there, he says. Professor Kirchner does not see the fractured state of Europe being healed by the new constitution, even if it is adopted, but by growing prosperity. </p> <p>\"Europe has always delivered economically. If it can do that sufficiently for the new countries they will come around much more to a kind of shared understanding and similar values. The ethos of the EU is peaceful coexistence.\" </p> <p>When it comes to the admission of Turkey to the EU, the US has always been strongly in favour because it fits with its policy in the middle east; that won't change under Kerry. What is changing, argues Professor Kirchner, is the attitude of Germany and France. Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, has spoken strongly in favour of Turkey as a secular state that could bridge Islam and Europe and Jacques Chirac has been making similar noises. With the UK broadly in favour, Professor Kirchner argues Italy will fall into line. Beyond Turkey, Europe's attempts to build partnerships with the kingdoms of the middle east and achieve a settlement in Palestine will become even more important - but a potential source of argument with the US.</p> <p>Europe's borders have shifted to the east and Turkey would bring it into contact with the states of the Caucasus like Georgia and Armenia, and with central Asia. </p> <p>\"The Americans understand there is a rough division of labour if the EU gets involved in the Caucasus and central Asia - that's burden-sharing. Take Afghanistan - the Europeans are running the peace-building programme,\" notes Professor Kirchner, who concludes that Germany is still anti-war but behind the scenes is prepared to work with the US. </p> <p>\"I think there will be more of a division of labour emerging in the next four years, certainly under Kerry but even under Bush - but there are still the risk of rupture points, especially Iran.\" In November the issue of Iran's nuclear programme comes to the UN and if Bush is in belligerent mood that would provoke a deeper split with Europe.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The University of Essex is holding a one-day conference on the European constitutional treaty next Wednesday November 3 at the Moot Hall, Colchester.

  "<p>England today confirmed their intention to go ahead with their controversial tour of Zimbabwe next month after a safety inspection.</p> <p>England and Wales Cricket Board chairman David Morgan is satisfied, following a report from two of his delegates just back from a visit to Bulawayo and Harare, that Michael Vaughan's team will be safe in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>\"The ECB management board has received a thorough report from the pre-tour visit, and we are grateful to the delegation that went to Zimbabwe and to the ZCU for their full co-operation with the visit,\" said Morgan. </p> <p>\"We have satisfied ourselves that appropriate safety and security measures will be in place to protect the England touring party and officials. </p> <p>\"We are also concerned about the safety and security of travelling supporters and the media, and we concluded that Zimbabwe will provide a safe environment provided that they adhere to the Government's specific travel advice. </p> <p>\"I will be travelling with the team throughout the tour alongside the chief executive of the PCA, Richard Bevan, which will ensure we are able to respond to any major issues as quickly as possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>WENGER AGREES NEW DEAL</p> <p>The Fiver loves nothing more than a good old-fashioned whodunnit: the twists, the turns, the psycho redneck with Ged Houllier's eyes, a Deliverance-style twang and the greasier-than-Roy-Cropper's-spoon side-parting who ALWAYS turns out to be a red herring. And today, to a list including Maggie Simpson (shot Mr Burns) and Peter Stringfellow's hairdresser (created that monstrosity) we were able to add Ashley Cole, who was fingered as the man who ignored the starving thousands around the world and threw a fresh pizza-WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WAS CESC FABREGAS?!</p> <p>\"Cesc was already a hit with the fans,\" an Arsenal fan told the Star, \"but throwing pizza at Fergie is the stuff of legends.\" Or fiction, if today's Sun is anything to go by. \"Ashley loves pizza. He'd normally eat it not throw it,\" snorted their ubiquitous 'witness', as sides split all over the Home Counties. \"The Arsenal players thought it was hilarious.\" But the laughing has to stop sometime, if only for the sake of a contrived segue, and so Arsene Wenger - borrowing one of his mate Fergie's favourite tricks and sending the press hounds totally off the scent - signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal today.</p> <p>\"I love this club and am very happy here,\" cooed Wenger, as Cole and Fabregas pegged it out the back door. \"These are exciting times for Arsenal and I'm proud to be the manager.\" Wenger, who's signed on until 2008, was proud of his brave boys on Sunday - but the Arsenal directors weren't. Apparently suits from Highbury and Old Trafford will now meet over a 74-course buffet (insert your own pea soup/pizza gag here) in a bid to ensure that love, peace and harmony will prevail the next time the clubs meet.

Their latest investigation - about the 666th they've launched this week - will look into last night's incidents at the New Den, which allegedly involved racist chanting from the Millwall fans and narked Liverpool fans shouting, jostling and chucking 68 seats onto the pitch.</p> <p>Lions chairman Theo Paphitis was at a loss to explain the away supporters' behaviour, observing simply that \"football fans act in funny ways\". It could be that just as Arsene Wenger suffers from sudden attacks of blindness, Paphitis was struck by temporary deafness, since scores of ear-witnesses claim the roots of their rage were taunts from the Millwall fans at their black players and derisive chants about Hillsborough (\"You Should Have Died At Hillsborough\" etc), Jamie Bulger, Ken Bigley and anything else deemed likely to offend.</p> <p>Such suggestions, however, left Paphitis unmoved. \"I am fed up with hearing that the poor old Liverpool fans were provoked into getting onto the pitch and into trying to fight the police, and that it is all Millwall's fault,\" he stormed. The crux of his argument - that nasty taunts aren't an excuse for a riot - isn't completely unreasonable. (And Manchester United supporters, used to being reminded of the Munich air crash by, amongst others, some Liverpool fans, may or may not share that view.)

  "<p>Factories and power plants will be able to pour more carbon dioxide - the chief greenhouse gas - into the atmosphere under allowances announced by the government today.</p> <p>The move, part of the EU emissions trading scheme, was unveiled by the environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, amid complaints from green groups and MPs that the prime minister has bowed to demands from industry at the expense of the environment and the fight against climate change.</p> <p>The new rules on industrial pollution permits must be submitted to the European commission for approval.</p> <p>Emissions by UK installations covered by the EU emissions trading scheme for the period 2005-7 are now estimated to be 56.1m tonnes of CO2, 7.6% higher than was the case in April. </p> <p>The government has been considering how to reflect this increase in emissions from the interim April projections.</p> <p>Ms Beckett said the government will propose an amendment to the National Allocation Plan, increasing the total number of UK allowances for 2005-7 by 19.8m allowances to 756.1m allowances.</p> <p>She said this is an increase of less than 3% from the number in the April plan. </p> <p>The allocation is now 5.2% below final projections of business as usual in the UK compared to the April allocation of 0.7% below business as usual. </p> <p>Mrs Beckett told a London news conference that the UK is still \"on course\" to meet its carbon dioxide reduction targets set in the Kyoto Protocol. </p> <p>But she admitted that since Labour had been in power \"although we have seen a reduction in carbon dioxide, it has started to go up again. But that has happened all over the northern hemisphere.\" </p> <p>Mrs Beckett said the government is determined to keep on track with its domestic greenhouse gas targets. But the government wanted to make emissions trading a success without damaging industrial competitiveness.</p> <p>\"This decision is good news for tackling climate change. The EU emissions trading scheme is a vital part of our drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across Europe.</p> <p>\"The scheme is crucial in encouraging industry to develop more energy-efficient technology and adapt to a lower carbon future.</p> <p>She said: \"The fact of the matter is that we as a government were faced with a genuine and real dilemma. Projections suggested that if we stuck with the original formula, it would have had a devastating effect on our industry. None of us wanted to do that, but all of us wanted to get the emissions trading scheme off the ground.\"</p> <p>Defra said the industrial non-generating sectors will continue to receive an allocation based on their needs.</p> <p>Overall the emissions cap will take the UK beyond its Kyoto commitment and is consistent with its domestic goal of moving towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions on 1990 levels by 2010.</p> <p>A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said: \"Margaret Beckett is not the villain here at all. It is Blair and the Department of Trade and Industry, who have failed to put the environment ahead of industry.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman, Norman Baker, condemned the introduction of more generous \"pollution permits\".</p> <p>He said: \"This is further evidence that Tony Blair will never bite the bullet when it comes to the environment. He always takes the side of the polluters, never the side of the environment.\"</p> <p>David Porter, chief executive of the Association of Electricity Producers, said substantial investment was needed to get carbon emissions down.</p> <p>He said: \"We must have an allocation for the generating sector which recognises what the industry emits today and allows time for transition to a lower carbon future.\"</p>",

  "<p>Time Warner has tabled a 2bn euro offer for Big Brother producer Endemol in a bid to cash in on the worldwide popularity of the company's hit global TV formats.</p> <p>The world's largest media group made the offer in a letter to Endemol's parent, the Spanish communications giant Telefonica, saying it was interesting in buying the unit, which is one of the few global independent production companies able to sell its own formats worldwide.</p> <p>Time Warner executives met Telefonica representatives in New York a few weeks ago to discuss the acquisition, Spanish newspaper La Gaceta reported today.</p> <p>News of a possible deal comes as Telefonica continues its strategy of jettisoning the non-core assets built up during the dotcom era by its former chairman, Juan Villalonga.</p> <p>Last December Endemol's co-founder, Jon De Mol, was ousted and replaced by Telefonica's appointee, Joaquin Agut Bonsfills, in a move widely seen as a precursor to a sale.</p> <p>City analysts in the UK have been expecting a sale for the past year but say the problem has been the depressed share price and the complicated deals management have secured in the various countries where Endemol is established.</p> <p>In the UK the company is behind shows such as Five's The Farm, Ready Steady Cook on BBC1 and BBC2's Restoration. Endemol produced some of BBC's biggest lifestyle series, including Changing Rooms, Ground Force and Food &amp; Drink. </p> <p>It also has a strong live events wing, which has produced the Bafta film awards for the past five years and the Brit awards between 1993 and 2000 under the aegis of Malcolm Gerrie, creator of seminal Channel 4 music programme, The Tube.</p> <p>If a sale goes ahead, the company's UK head, Peter Bazalgette - credited with devising Food &amp; Drink for the BBC more than 20 years ago - would stand to make a sizeable fortune.</p> <p>At the Edinburgh Television Festival, Bazalgette admitted the independent production company was \"in play\", hinting that he might lead a management buyout.</p> <p>City sources, however, said Telefonica would be less keen on negotiating the sales of individual country operations and more likely to favour a trade buyer.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Dutch-based Endemol Holdings declined to comment.</p> <p>Sales of Telefonica's non-telecoms assets in the past few months have fuelled further speculation that it would divest itself of the TV company should it get a reasonable price.</p> <p>Last month Telefonica sold its 5% stake in the Financial Times publisher, Pearson, for \u00a3236m as part of an ongoing plan to return its focus to telecoms.</p> <p>In August, Telefonica subsidiary Terra Networks sold the online search company Lycos as it sought to reduce its net debt of just under 19bn euros built up during a buying spree by Mr Villalonga, who lost his job three years ago.</p> <p>The current chairman, Cesar Alierta, has said Endemol is a non-core asset but is understood to be reluctant to sell it for much less that the 5bn euros Telefonica paid for it four years ago.</p> <p>Mr Alierta is wary of the colossal write-off Telefonica would face if it sold Endemol at current valuations.</p> <p>The company took a huge write-off on Lycos, which was sold to Korean company Daum communications for 82m euros, minus some assets in the US and Europe, four years after Telefonica acquired the group in a stock deal valued at 12.5 billion euros.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "It might not boast the most well-watered greens in the world or the best standard of food and drink at the 19th hole. But Australia's treeless Nullarbor Plain will, within 18 months, play host to the world's largest golf course. <p>The Nullarbor Links will cross three time zones and stretch across 850 miles of barren semi-desert across the flat, featureless landscape spanning the border between Western Australia and South Australia.</p> <p>There will be one hole for each stop along the 850-mile route - from Kalgoorlie, 450 miles east of Perth, to Ceduna, 500 miles west of Adelaide.</p> <p>Even by travelling non-stop at the speed limit, it would take 13 hours to get from one end of the course to the other.</p> <p>\"It's not going to be St Andrews by any stretch of the imagination,\" said Alf Caputo, of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder tourist association. \"But it's going to be something completely unique to this region.\"</p> <p>Around 300 people live permanently along the stretch of road, but thousands more travel across the featureless plain every month, on the main route between Perth and Australia's eastern cities. Eucla, close to the border between Western and South Australia, which has its own golf green, is a relative metropolis with a population of 50.</p> <p>All but four of the fairways will be made of sand, since grass is hard to maintain in an environment which includes some of the driest places in the world. A last hurdle to completion of the course was cleared this week when the city council of Kalgoorlie-Boulder gave its approval to the plan.</p> <p>The Nullarbor is a land of superlatives. The pancake-flat, treeless landscape is home to a 300-mile stretch of ruler- straight railway track which is the longest in the world, and a 91-mile section of similarly unbending road.</p> <p>The entire drive between Perth and Adelaide amounts to 30 hours on the road, with little but the horizon and service stations to break the monotony.</p> <p>The idea was inspired by Bob Bongiorno, a frustrated golfer who manages the Balladonia Roadhouse south-east of Kalgoorlie. He said: \"I brought my clubs out to the Nullarbor, but I will have to fight the spiders to get them back. I've not used them in ages.\"</p>",
  "George Bush will ask for $70bn in emergency funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan early next year if he is re-elected, as the US military considers raising troop levels by more than 20,000 to secure the planned Iraqi elections, according to reports yesterday. <p>The need for additional funding was one of a series of blows to the re-election hopes of the US president to emerge from Iraq yesterday. In another development, the Iraqi interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, appeared to turn on his White House supporters when he accused US-led forces of \"major neglect\" over the weekend murder of 49 Iraqi army recruits by insurgents. </p> <p>Mr Allawi told the Iraqi interim national council that the slaughter \"was an ugly crime in which a large group of national guards were martyred. We believe this issue was the outcome of major neglect by some parts of the multinational [forces]\". </p> <p>Iraq's minister of state for national security said later that Mr Allawi was not assigning blame but waiting for the findings of an inquiry into the massacre, due in three weeks. \"The investigation will seek to determine whether inside information was obtained on the movement of troops and why the troops were unarmed,\" Kassim Daoud told Reuters. </p> <p>There was also another kidnapping, this time of a Japanese hostage. A group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi threatened to behead the hostage unless Tokyo withdrew its troops from Iraq within 48 hours. </p> <p>US officials said they could not confirm the details of press reports citing the need for extra cash in Iraq, but they said reinforcements would be necessary due to the widespread insurgency, and that the Pentagon would submit a substantial extra-budgetary request for funds to Congress in February. </p> <p>The effort to contain the mounting Iraqi insurgency is consuming about 85% of all spending on the \"global war on terror\" - expected to reach $225bn by the end of next year. </p> <p>John Kerry's supporters were quick to compare the estimates with a prediction made at the end of 2002 by Mitch Daniels, the administration's top budget official, that the war would cost between $50bn and $60bn. \"This is the incredible price of going it almost alone in Iraq,\" Mr Kerry said in Wisconsin. \"How much more will the American people have to pay.\" </p> <p>The mounting costs of the conflict went unmentioned by Mr Bush, who spent yesterday on a last-minute dash through the battleground states of Iowa and Wisconsin, where he continued to accuse his rival of lacking resolve to fight terror. \"We're in the middle of a global war on terror. In the war on terror, there's no place for confusion, no place for weakness, no substitute for victory,\" he said in Wisconsin. </p> <p>\"I believe if America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Even if you might not agree with me, you know where I stand.\" </p> <p>The president's campaign aides denied he was being forced on to the defensive. But with the race entering its final days, and with no sign of any steady Republican lead emerging, they were growing jumpy. </p> <p>In public, Mr Bush betrays no nervousness. But in a sign of the tightness of the battle, he launched an effort to win over disillusioned Democrats by accusing Mr Kerry of abandoning his own party's princi ples. \"The party of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy is rightly remembered for confidence and resolve in times of war and in hours of crisis,\" he said. \"Senator Kerry has turned his back on 'pay any price'.\" </p> <p>The emergency war spending request expected to be submitted in February would total $70bn, the Washington Post reported yesterday. That is in addition to $25bn already requested for 2005, suggesting the cost of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts is escalating. The administration requested $87bn for war costs this year. </p> <p>Concerned that the multi-national force requested by Washington was unlikely to arrive, US commanders believe they may have to increase American troop levels from an average of 138,000 to 160,000. Officials said the Pentagon is considering delaying the departure of some troops and speeding the arrival of others. </p> <p>A Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable, said he could not confirm the troop figures.</p>",
  "<b>Lords hunting vote</b> <br> The House of Lords voted overwhelmingly to allow registered hunting with hounds. Voting was 322 to 72, majority 250, during the hunting bill's committee stage. The move, in defiance of the government's bill which outlaws hunting, puts the Lords once more on a collision course with MPs. <p>It came after nearly three hours of emotional and at times angry debate. Environment minister Lord Whitty was pressed repeatedly to spell out the government's position on the bill and if it would use the Parliament Act to steamroller a hunting ban into law. </p> <p>He insisted it was up to the Lords to come up \"with a proposition which is likely to engage the majority in the House of Commons. If not it is you who are putting us on course for the potential deadlock and therefore potential use of the Parliament Act.\" </p> <p>But Labour peer Lord Donoughue, who urged peers to back the amendment, said registration for hunts was a \"constructive compromise,\" and the vast bulk of the new bill was identical to the government's previous bill. </p> <p><b>Use of Parliament Act</b><br> Tempers flared on all sides of the Commons over the possible use of the Parliament Act to force through a ban. Ministers faced a barrage of criticism from MPs. the government was repeatedly warned that invoking the Act would be regarded as an abuse of power. </p> <p>The constitutional affairs minister, Christopher Leslie, said ministers still hoped agreement could be reached, but emphasised that ultimately the will of the Commons must prevail. </p> <p>Oliver Heald, for the Tories, had warned that using the act was a \"massive exercise\" of government executive power. \"It's the parliamentary nuclear option and should only be used sparingly,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Parliamentary language</b><br>Visitors to parliament will no longer be referred to as \"strangers\" but instead \"the public\" after MPs voted to drop the term under modernisation moves. The Commons leader, Peter Hain, dubbed it \"an ancient, medieval practice...we should get rid of\". </p> <p>References to \"strangers\" date back to 1575 and times when the public was barred from scrutinising what went on at Westminster, he said. </p> <p>But the shadow Commons leader, Oliver Heald, warned against \"stripping away the charm and magic\" of parliament. \"The suggestion that not calling members of the public strangers will improve the accessibility of parliament to the public is surely misguided,\" he argued. </p> <p>To some Tory shouts of \"shame!\", voting was 242 to 167, majority 75, to drop the term strangers. </p> <p><b>EU asylum policy</b><br>Britain retains the right to \"opt-in or out\" of European immigration and asylum policy, home secretary David Blunkett insisted. Despite giving up Britain's veto on EU asylum policy, Mr Blunkett said the government was pursuing a \"balanced and sensible\" policy. </p> <p>Answering an emergency question, he said he was proud of the agreement hammered out at Monday's meeting of justice and home affairs ministers in Luxembourg. </p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, warned it was a matter of constitutional importance for Britain to lose the power of veto over asylum and immigration. He accused the government of deliberately employing \"the politics of confusion\" to disguise the impact of the change, which amounted to a \"surrender\" of Britain's ability to control its own borders. </p> <p><b>Future of Scottish regiments</b><br>The government came under fire from MPs again over plans for a major reorganisation of Scottish regiments. Tory Peter Atkinson said there was \"outrage in Scotland at the treatment of the Black Watch and other Scottish regiments\". Plans are being considered to scrap one of Scotland's six infantry regiments and merge the remaining five into a new Scottish \"super regiment\". </p> <p>The Scottish secretary, Alistair Darling, said he was aware of \"people's understandable concern\" about the reorganisation. \"I'm equally aware that many people attach very great importance to maintaining the historic traditions and identities of the Scottish regiments and I hope that is something that will be taken into account\" by the Army Board and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. </p> <p><b>Jaguar production</b><br> Small businesses would be \"largely unaffected\" by controversial proposals to end production of Jaguar cars in Coventry, the government said. Ford has announced that it wants to close the luxury car maker's Browns Lane plant, cutting 1,150 jobs. Local MPs have warned that many other jobs could be affected in the area. But trade minister Jacqui Smith said production would only be moved around 16 miles to Castle Bromwich. </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br>Tory former chancellor Lord Lawson attacked a \"blood-curdling\" speech by Tony Blair warning about the dangers of climate change. The prime minister called for further investment in new low-carbon technologies to counter the threat. </p> <p>Lord Lawson said: \"The prime minister's blood-curdling remarks about the imminent threat to the people of this country from global warming are probably about as well-founded as his earlier remarks about the imminent threat to them from weapons of mass destruction from Iraq.\" </p> <p><b>Procesed food labelling</b><br> Processed foods should be marked with nutritional labels to prevent people relying on \"guesswork and good luck\", urged Labour's Helen Southworth. She said pre-packaged foods that have been processed in some way should be labelled to give people the fullest information on what they are eating. </p> <p>Nutritional information must be clear, easy to read and \"compare like with like\", she said introducing her prepared foods (provision of information) bill which has no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Plastic bags tax</b><br>There are no plans for a tax on plastic bags despite peers' pleas that it would be good for the planet, the government said. Labour's Lord Dubs said the answer was disappointing. \"Plastic causes enormous death and injury to birds, marine mammals and other forms of wildlife.\" The Irish Republic's tax had reduced plastic bag usage there by 90%. </p> <p>But government spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said although the tax in Ireland was reducing the usage of certain plastic bags \"the more robust plastic bags, which are outside the tax, are used more extensively. </p> <p><b>Cost of anti-war protests</b><br> Policing anti-war protests at RAF Fairford during the Iraq war cost the taxpayer more than \u00a37m. The total bill for policing the Gloucestershire airbase where US B-52 bombers were stationed last year was \u00a37.7m, Home Office minister Hazel Blears said. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br> The Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, and his ministers face MPs at question time. This is followed at noon by questions to the prime minister. MPs then debate the remaining stages of the domestic violence and victims of crime bill. In the Lords, peers continue debate on the committee stage of the hunting bill.</p>",
  "<p>For 21 years, Mark Serwotka put on his grey suit, popped his bowler hat on his faceless head, then went to the office to waste time - according to the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and Tory leader Michael Howard. But for the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and his 312,000 members, that is nonsense. </p> <p>\"More people depend on services we deliver than any other part of the public sector,\" Serwotka insists. </p> <p>A benefits officer from the south Wales valley of Aberdare for more than two decades, Serwotka's career typifies those of his members, a quarter of whom are paid less than \u00a313,750. When he was elected general secretary in 2000 - he took office a year later - Serwotka was earning the full-time equivalent of \u00a316,500. He spent the last six years of his career as a part- timer so he could look after his two young daughters while his civil servant wife Ruth - on a marginally better salary - worked full time. </p> <p>A benefits officer's lot (starting salary \u00a310,300) is not a happy one. \"It is very stressful,\" Serwotka says. \"Nobody values your contribution. At its starkest, you had the public shouting at you - quite understandably at times because they are the most vulnerable in society - and had computers that didn't work properly. It was quite a stressful environment\". </p> <p>The union's membership can be found in every nook of civic life - museums, magistrates courts, parliamentary security, driving test centres, passport offices, Whitehall, the Inland Revenue and quangos. The common denominator is that they all work for services run by government. </p> <p>The truth is that the civil service was never sexy, earning the term \"bureaucrat\" more in contempt than as a mark of respect. But the profession is now being maligned as never before through the political prism of \"waste\" and \"efficiency\". </p> <p>Gordon Brown, claimed this summer that he could comfortably eliminate 100,000 civil service posts - just under one in five - on the back of last spring's efficiency review by Sir Peter Gershon, and with no perceivable damage to public service delivery. This breaks down roughly into 20,000 posts from local and regional government, and 84,000 from the central civil service. The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, said he would match that with a freeze on civil service recruitment from the first day the Tories came to office, resulting in 100,000 fewer staff through natural waste over six years. </p> <p>Serwotka's members responded last week by voting overwhelmingly for their first national strike in 11 years - 265,000 of 312,000 were balloted (the rest exempt as they are employed in the private sector). The walkout, Serwotka says, \"will show government, but also the politicians and the public, the importance of the civil service, to make people realise how ingrained it is in society.\" </p> <p>Serwotka says he is angry at the false dichotomy between back office and frontline public sector delivery, which sees teachers and nurses lauded while \"faceless bureaucrats\" are considered wasteful and inefficient. </p> <p>He believes the slur is political manipulation intended to soften up the public over cuts, which he says are motivated by the government's desire to silence Tory claims that the civil service has become fat under Labour, to the tune of 55,000 more posts. \"We are delivering things the government has brought in through legislation,\" says Serwotka. \"The minimum wage, tax credits ... someone has to deliver them, and we supported Brown on it.\" </p> <p>He claims the cuts are not about efficiency, but \"about crude headcounts, to achieve reductions because of party politics.\" </p> <p>Serwotka learned of the cuts from TV - announced by the chancellor as part of his spending review speech last summer. He disputes Brown's assurances that public service delivery will remain unscathed by such a haemorrhaging of staff. He says: \"If that had any shred of truth, you can conclude that there are 100,000 people at work with nothing to do, which is clearly nonsense, or that he will make the cuts in services by using private companies. The third option is that he will have an army of casual workers who will not figure in headcounts. The only way he can protect services is to do one of these three things, which I think are all the wrong routes.\" </p> <p>Efficiencies could still be made, says Serwotka, listing the \"constructive suggestions\" his union has submitted to the government. For example, the government could make considerable savings by scrapping the 229 different civil service pay negotiations and replacing them with national bargaining, he says. This would bring parity to a sector that has salary variations of up to \u00a33,000 between departments for similar posts. Calling time on private government contracts, which are often millions of pounds over budget, and on the \u00a33.5bn lavished by government on private consultants could also make potential savings. </p> <p>The union wants an end to private contracts that fail. As for Brown's calls for wiser spending, Serwotka agrees that this has huge savings potential. \"We have made suggestions, but we have been ignored,\" he says. </p> <p>Serwotka, the adopted son of a south Welsh mother and a Polish electronic engineer father, makes no secret of his leftwing tendencies. He began his union career within a month of his first job, aged 16. But he denies that he is \"strike-happy\". He says: \"When you have a dialogue of the deaf you need to do something to make them notice.\" The national strike will be the sign language of choice. The union is getting quite good at striking, having notched up half a million strike days this year. </p> <p>Serwotka is graced with a winning, demotic leadership style, and is not above asserting his successes. Since taking over the reins in 2001, membership has soared 23%, and in the past two months 2,000 new members have joined, making it probably the fastest growing union at a time of general membership decline. </p> <p>The national strike will be in pursuit of five demands aside from the headline job cuts, covering pensions, the proposed relocation of 20,000 civil servants from London and the south-east, plans to reduce sickness benefits, and a freeze on the privatisation of services. </p> <p>A tad ambitious perhaps? \"It will be an incredible success in terms of showing who the membership of our trade union are, and I think there will be central discussions that will address some of these concerns. If not, we are clear the campaign will continue.\" </p> <p>Next Friday's strike is part of a wider campaign to dispel the myths surrounding the futility of civil servants, but a large equal-pay claim is also making its way through the courts, demonstrating that the union will resort to legal action. </p> <p>Serwotka is skilled at using the media and politicians. He has already marshalled what he claims is the most effective parliamentary group in Westminster, comprising Tory as well as Labour MPs. With a high-profile leadership, and his concertina of strategies, Serwotka is hardly faceless, and certainly wastes no time.

  "<p>The US authorities in Iraq have been ranked as one of the biggest dangers to journalists in the world, worse than the regime in Georgia and Afghanistan in a new global survey of press freedom.</p> <p>They have been ranked 108th by Reporters Without Borders, putting them just above Cambodia and only 11 places ahead of the Palestinian Authority in terms of safety.</p> <p>The press freedom organisation said it had given the US its own separate ranking in the war-torn country because of the number of journalists killed by US army gunfire.</p> <p>\"Six journalists and media assistants have been killed by US army gunfire without the US military ever conducting proper enquiries.

  "Documents obtained by the Guardian disclose today how one of the world's biggest tobacco companies, British American Tobacco, was able to put private pressure on Tony Blair and a cabinet minister who wanted to hold an inquiry into allegations that the firm was colluding with criminals. <p>Behind the back of parliament and public, the head of British American Tobacco (BAT), Martin Broughton, obtained access to Mr Blair at a private breakfast, followed by an equally private meeting with the then trade secretary, Stephen Byers. </p> <p>These unpublicised privileges were granted despite the fact that his company stood accused of colluding in cigarette smuggling on an unprecedented scale. </p> <p>Two former senior Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) officials on BAT's payroll were also used to approach their former departmental colleagues. </p> <p>After this behind-the-scenes lobbying, Mr Byers' own plan for an inquiry, which could have published a highly damaging report, was dropped. </p> <p>Instead, MPs were told that a watered-down inquiry would be conducted in secret. Its activities were \"buried\" for almost four years, after which it emerged that no action was to be taken. BAT was so pleased with the eventual form the inquiry took that their lobbyists described it, in a private note, as \"not a problem\". </p> <p>The Guardian is publishing the documents on its website today. </p> <p>The papers, obtained partly thanks to Whitehall's moves towards freedom of information, and partly from BAT's archives, record how powerful the private influence of large corporations can be. </p> <p>This power is evident today as BAT and other tobacco companies lobby against moves to force them to put graphic photographs, such as smoke-damaged organs and clogged arteries, on their cigarette packets to warn of the dangers of smoking. </p> <p>Four years ago, pressure mounted on Mr Broughton, the \u00a31.4m-a-year chairman of BAT, after this newspaper published documents detailing how the London-based corporation condoned tax evasion in a global effort to boost sales. </p> <p>According to the documents, BAT arranged to supply massive numbers of cigarettes to wholesalers and distributors, expecting that they would find their way into crooked hands and on to the black markets of developing countries after being smuggled across national borders, without duty being paid. </p> <p>Stephen Byers was threatening to set up an inquiry into the world's second biggest tobacco firm and publish the results. </p> <p>Such a report might be highly damaging for BAT, opening the door to lawsuits from foreign governments cheated of taxes and unable to enforce public health standards. </p> <p>In early 2000, BAT's lobbyists tracked sessions of a House of Commons all-party health committee inquiry into smoking, reporting back to the company's Thames-side headquarters that the then health secretary, Alan Milburn, was unsympathetic. </p> <p>\"He showed little interest in working with tobacco companies ... suggesting distrust of the companies' motives,\" warned a lobbyist in February 2000. Another noted: \"Milburn had read the serious allegations in the Guardian article and commented that the government abhors this behaviour\". </p> <p>Mr Broughton's first reaction was to approach Mr Milburn's colleague, Stephen Byers, privately. \"A constructive working relationship,\" was required, said Mr Broughton, a non-smoker, adding: \"I am writing therefore to ask for a meeting with you\". </p> <p>BAT, with the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke on its board, hoped the DTI, in its role as \"sponsor\" of British industry, might provide a more sympathetic channel than the health department. </p> <p>But Mr Broughton got the cold shoulder. Mr Byers was close to the anti-smoking Alan Milburn, and refused to grant the tobacco chief an audience. </p> <p>A DTI minute stated: \"The company has made a number of attempts to meet DTI ministers since the election, but until now all requests have been declined.\" </p> <p>One of BAT's inhouse lobbyists, Simon Millson, made contact with the official heading the DTI's tobacco desk, Julian Ebsworth: \"I tried to pursue the issue on whether we would get a meeting. He said that was for the minister to decide 'given all the other issues' ... I sense some buck-passing going on\". </p> <p>In March, Mr Byers signalled that he planned to set up an inquiry under section 432 of the Companies Act, allowing files to be seized, employees to be questioned on oath, and - crucially - permitted Mr Byers to \"cause any such report to be ... published\". </p> <p>Mr Broughton immediately wrote to Stephen Byers again, on March 9, claiming the smuggling allegations were \"highly partisan\". His plea was shuffled off to the Treasury, nominally responsible for smuggling issues. </p> <p>A few days later, however, everything changed. Mr Broughton was able to go over Mr Byers' head, as a member of a shadowy group of privileged lobbyists - the \"multinational chairman's group\", whose members include BP, Shell, the drinks firm Diageo, Unilever, and Vodafone. </p> <p>Mr Broughton was on the shortlist of those invited to eat bacon and eggs with the prime minister in the Downing Street stateroom overlooking the rose garden. </p> <p>Mr Byers, too, had been summoned to the breakfast table by Mr Blair on March 14. The company chairman seized the opportunity, button-holing the minister who had been avoiding him. After shaking hands in No 10, Mr Byers was left with no alternative but to change his tune. \"In the margins of that breakfast briefing,\" as an official note records, \"the secretary of state agreed to [a] meeting\". </p> <p>That afternoon, BAT's lobbyists rang the department in triumph: \"Mr Broughton has secured a meeting with the secretary of state\". </p> <p>Mr Millson later boasted : \"It was said we have been very successful in getting the one-to-one meeting with Byers ... There are few companies that have achieved this.\" </p> <p>\"Dear Martin\", Mr Byers wrote back, in warmer nomenclature than before. He apologised for the \"error\" in redirecting his earlier letter. </p> <p>The secretary of state had been pressured into a private meeting with a firm into which he was trying to order an official inquiry. By contrast, ASH, the anti-smoking campaigners, say they asked for a similar meeting with Mr Byers, and were refused. </p> <p>Mr Broughton followed up with intensive lobbying of No 10, sending Mr Blair a long letter demanding that he cut taxes on cigarettes, and hinting that smuggling would continue unabated into Britain if he did not cooperate: \"The chosen tax policy contains within it the seeds of its own destruction.\" </p> <p>In April, he told BAT shareholders at the annual general meeting: \"There is really no need for a DTI investigation.\" </p> <p>Whitehall refuses to release the minutes of the subsequent meeting with Mr Byers. But we obtained BAT's version from their archive, which they have been forced to disclose in settlement of a US lawsuit. </p> <p>Mr Byers, with Julian Ebsworth at his side, appeared to accept that his department's job was to support the tobacco industry \"stating the DTI was a sponsor of the arms industry and that, although many did not like it 'we had to deal with it'.\" </p> <p>Mr Broughton demanded the DTI back BAT in its legal fight against the government of Colombia, which was bringing a lawsuit in the US over the smuggling allegations. BAT's minute claims: \"On Colombia litigation, Byers was unequivocal; he will do whatever he can\". </p> <p>Afterwards, BAT used its private links to Mr Byers' officials to get some background. Nicola Shears, who had spent eight years at the DTI, was on BAT's payroll. So was Ray Mingay, recent former head of export promotion at the DTI. Both talked to officials on BAT's behalf, according to the documents. </p> <p>Mr Byers himself, according to associates, had no idea that Mr Mingay was now working for BAT. He was shocked when told the former civil servant had been contacting his senior officials behind his back. </p> <p>\"Subsequent to the [Byers] meeting,\" Mr Millson wrote, \"Nicola Shears and myself have learned that Byers and the two civil servants present felt the meeting went well. They were impressed with Martin ... who put his points across clearly and succinctly\". </p> <p>Significantly, Mr Millson wrote: \"It was also recognised that BAT is one of Britain's 'world-class' companies\". </p> <p>This is one of the terms repeatedly used by the DTI and by Downing Street to justify explicitly business-friendly policies. </p> <p>The threatened inquiry ran into the sand after that. Friends of Mr Byers say his civil servants tried to persuade him to cancel it, claiming there was insufficient evidence. </p> <p>Mr Byers insisted it go ahead, maintaining he had no alternative when the health committee were calling for an investigation. </p> <p>Yet Mr Byers was persuaded to make a crucial change. Instead of ordering an inquiry under Section 432, which would have led to a public report, he agreed to use Section 447 of the Companies Act which, crucially for the company, prohibited publication. </p> <p>One of BAT's lobbyists, John Roberts, subsequently emailed a colleague dismissively: \"The DTI inquiry is a distraction, not a problem.\" </p> <p>And so it proved to be. The DTI buried their \"inquiry\" for an extraordinary length of time - almost four years, during which they released no information whatever, and Mr Byers left the scene. </p> <p>When protests mounted, officials finally announced, under a new trade secretary, Patricia Hewitt, that they had found insufficient evidence for legal action. Campaigners point out that the blanket secrecy guarantees no one can check the genuineness of their work. </p> <p>A spokesman for BAT said lst night: \"We have always maintained we acted legally.\" </p> <p>He denied that the two ex-DTI employees had had \"undue influence over the DTI\".</p>",
  "<p>Omnicom, the world's largest marketing services group, yesterday reported a 17% increase in third-quarter profits, providing evidence that the stuttering advertising recovery has begun to pick up steam. </p> <p>The company, which owns advertising agencies BBDO and DDB Worldwide, said earnings rose to $145.3m (\u00a379m) in the three months to September 30. Revenues increased by 14% to $2.3bn. </p> <p>Omnicom said part of the improvement came from advertisers bringing their fourth-quarter budgets forward to spend around the Olympics. The business also benefited from a more widespread rise in global advertising, it said. </p> <p>The profits beat Wall Street expectations, giving a fillip to Omnicom shares, which rose by 8% in mid-day trading on Wall Street to $78.70. Revenues from Britain rose by 12.2% to reach $255.5m during the quarter. </p> <p>The group added some high profile accounts, including Subaru of America and sandwich chain Subway. It snatched the advertising account of the food and confectionery group Mars from Grey Global, days after it was acquired by WPP. Mars consolidated its global advertising account into Omnicom agencies BBDO and TBWA this month, retaining Grey for \"below-the-line\" work including direct marketing and sales promotion. </p> <p>John Wren, the chief executive, said the new accounts picture should only improve. \"The new business pipeline is pretty robust,\" he said \"You have a number of clients that are currently in review [for an advertising agency] and we fully expect that there'll be more as you move forward.\" </p> <p>Merrill Lynch analyst Lauren Rich Fine called the results \"something to celebrate\". </p> <p>The pick-up in advertising spend appeared to be broadly spread geographically. Revenue from the US grew by 14% to $1.3bn, while sales outside the domestic market were 14% higher at $2.3bn. </p> <p>Analysts have estimated that the Olympics and the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on the US presidential race have accounted for 7% of the gain in advertising spend in America this year. Conventional advertising was up nearly 11%.</p>",
  "<p>Allan Leighton, the former Asda boss who coined the phrase \"going plural\", resigned yesterday from three of his boardroom positions, prompting speculation that he is clearing his diary to join a team that might bid for Marks &amp; Spencer or J Sainsbury. </p> <p>Mr Leighton refused to give any indication of what big job he might be considering after giving up the chairmanships of the online travel company lastminute.com and Cannons health clubs, and a non-executive boardroom position at the household appliances group Dyson. </p> <p>He ruled out spending more time with his family. \"That is one thing I won't be doing. I won't be spending more time with them because they would say, 'why change the habit of a lifetime?',\" Mr Leighton said. </p> <p>Even after resigning from the three positions, with effect from early next year, Mr Leighton said that he was \"still pretty plural\". </p> <p>He is chairman of Royal Mail and holds boardroom positions at the satellite broadcaster BSkyB; the department store Bhs, owned by the retail entrepreneur Philip Green, and the companies controlled by the Canadian billionaire Galen Weston, who took over the up-market department store Selfridges last year. </p> <p>Mr Leighton, a former director at Leeds United football club, said : \"It will enable me to spend a bit more time on Galen Weston's businesses, which I have to be in the US and Canada for. If I were doing less, I'd being doing more there.\" </p> <p>He is rumoured to have been approached by private equity firms about becoming involved in possible deals on a regular basis. There is also speculation that he might team up again with Archie Norman, who lured him to Asda in the early 1990s, and who has just announced that he is standing down as a Conservative MP. </p> <p>The two are still in contact after leaving Asda, which is now owned by the American company Wal-Mart. </p> <p>The supermarket group Sainsbury's - which has admitted it will slump to its first ever loss - is regularly cited as a takeover target. </p> <p>This week, City deal-maker George Magan admitted he had looked at the grocer. M&amp;S rejected an approach from Mr Leighton's associate, Mr Green in the summer. </p> <p>Whatever Mr Leighton might have planned, he is contracted to the Royal Mail until March and eager to have his contract extended. </p> <p>Mr Leighton was yesterday described by James Dyson, famed for making the bag-less carpet cleaners that bear his name, as an \"entrepreneurial one-off\". </p> <p>\"He has brought a huge amount of skills to his non-executive role with us. His knowledge of retailing is peerless,\" Mr Dyson said. </p> <p>Mr Leighton's departure from lastminute.com comes at a difficult juncture for group, which epitomised the dotcom boom and made its co-founder, Martha Lane Fox, into a household name. She has now left leaving her co-founder, Brent Hoberman, as chief executive. </p> <p>This month, lastminute.com admitted the summer months had been \"challenging\" and earnings would be towards the lower end of the range it predicted in August. It is cutting 350 jobs to save money. Its shares have fallen from above 200p in May to close yesterday at 104.25p, down 0.75p. </p> <p>Mr Leighton will be replaced at lastminute.com by existing board member Brian Collie, who has already signalled his intention to leave airports group BAA.</p>",
  "<p>As Ofcom prepares its second magnum opus on the UK telecommunications market, there was a telling exchange yesterday between Richard Hooper, the regulator's deputy chairman, and Sir Bryan Carlsberg, a former head of its predecessor, Oftel. </p> <p>From the floor of the Economist telecoms conference in central London, Sir Bryan asked a question about the relative strengths of economies of scale versus economies of scope that was intelligible to just a handful of delegates. Mr Hooper shot back that given Sir Bryan had presided over a telecoms industry with just two players, \"in his day it was easy\". </p> <p>It was a fair comment. Since true deregulation took over from the duopoly of BT and Mercury 10 years ago, the market in this country has attracted hundreds of competitors. </p> <p>But Mr Hooper's comments highlight a growing unease within the industry - that Ofcom is in danger of over-theorising about the market because it thinks it is so complex. </p> <p>Ofcom has been churning out statements of principle as it grinds through its far-reaching review of the fixed-line market like a PhD student. This is great for scholars of regulatory thinking, but less so for companies with shareholders and budgets that need to meet things like business plans. </p> <p>In the past Oftel suffered from the exact opposite. It cut the market into tiny parcels, embarking on endless investigations, regardless of who had complained - failing throughout the process to elucidate anything like an over-arching principle as to what regulation was supposed to achieve. Now we have a regulator with plenty of principles. The industry now needs to see Ofcom knuckling down and dealing with the hard cases, where regulation comes into its own. </p> <p>The next phase of the telecoms review will make it clear where those hard cases are likely to arise. Ofcom must be prepared to say exactly what it will do when presented with one. </p> <p><strong>Redtop rage</strong><br> </p> <p>The introduction in yesterday's New York Post was emphatic: \"The Daily News has engaged in several practices that suggest the tabloid's circulation figures may be inflated, a Post investigation has revealed.\" </p> <p>This was Rupert Murdoch's New York Post unloading both barrels at its local tabloid rival, the Mort Zuckerman-owned Daily News. </p> <p>The two newspapers trade insults with all the regularity of Britain's Sun and Mirror. But on this occasion, the Post has gone to the trouble of interviewing a host of grocery store owners and other newspaper retailers across Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx to build up a picture of how the Daily News allegedly gives away copies, yet counts these as paid-for sales. </p> <p>Murdoch's paper has invited the local audit bureau of circulation to take a look at its findings, while yesterday the Daily News simply swiped the attack aside, noting: \"In an effort to delegitimise the Daily News, the NY Post has chosen to run yet another scurrilous story about our success.\" </p> <p>Dodgy circulation figures are serious news in the United States, where a string of papers - including Hollinger's Chicago Sun-Times - have confessed to padding their numbers. </p> <p>America's securities and exchange commission has even waded into the matter, overseeing a series of compensation payments to advertisers who thought they were buying more eyeballs than proved to be the case. </p> <p>In New York, the Daily News stands accused to offering retailers bundles of papers to give away with other purchases, with the publisher charging for those copies supplied but then reimbursing the retailers almost the entire cost at a later date. </p> <p>Could similar ruses be under way over here? There's no doubt that certain dark arts are routinely exercised in Britain to flatter headline sales figures, but it's a long time since we've had a full-blown scandal. Also while ABC audits newspaper figures over here, in the United States it largely relies on the numbers publishers supply. </p> <p>Assuming, however, that a successful tactic exercised in one corner of the Murdoch empire will be employed elsewhere, perhaps the Mirror's editor, Richard Wallace, should launch a pre-emptive investigation of his own. </p> <p><strong>Frying friends </strong><br> </p> <p>We could easily read too much into the decision by Britain's busiest man, Allan Leighton, to step down from a clutch of directorships. </p> <p>This declared \"friend of Philip Green\" has all the qualifications to lead a large public-to-private deal, and speculative target companies are not in short supply. What's more, while Leighton has enjoyed a swashbuckling career, the high points have not necessarily showered him with the sort of riches enjoyed by others in his executive circle. </p> <p>Yet in the short term at least it is probably safer to assume that he has left Lastminute, Cannons and Dyson because these roles offered him little person additional up side when his diary is already stretched, to say the least. </p> <p>Leighton is bound to be open to suggestions as to which corporate fish he should fry. But we are likely to have to wait until next year for him to choose one.</p>",
  "Fletchamoore Way looks like any small high street in Britain. There is a Safeway, Barclays bank, a few parked cars and a bus stop - but only the front half a bus. Even if the number 999's back end was attached, though, passengers would not get far, because these streets are inside a large warehouse near Bournemouth. <p>Welcome to Streetwise, a rather weird, life-sized, education centre where people with learning difficulties are taught how to live more independently by role-playing in a lifelike but safe indoor environment.</p> <p>Research shows that a high percentage of people with learning disabilities have been bullied on public transport - from being spat at by fellow passengers to being refused entry by bus drivers. On the half-bus at Streetwise, they learn how to report abuse to the authorities and where to sit to feel safe.</p> <p>This being Dorset, the Streetwise warehouse houses a mock farmyard complete with haystack and tractor, and lots of dangerous-looking tools; a beach - sponsored by the RNLI - where alcohol and needles lurk beneath the sand; and a heathland where beer cans lie among the debris of a burned-out car. \"Sometimes participants find it difficult to distinguish between real life and fiction,\" says Bonnie Bennett, project manager of the Coast scheme. \"We had a bag-snatch enactment and it was too real for some people.\"</p> <p>Citizenship, Opportunities And Safety Training (Coast) is a three-year project run by a housing association, Advance Housing and Support, Streetwise, and Bournemouth Council for Voluntary Service. It is funded by the Housing Corporation and charitable foundations.</p> <p>More than 200 people with learning disabilities have attended courses this year on personal safety, money matters, DIY - which includes a trip to a real B&amp;Q store - and reducing crime and fear of crime. What to do when a beggar asks for 20p, and how to report a football hooligan daubing paint on a fence are two other scenarios played out on the course. Police are among the agencies providing the training.</p> <p>Participants include a range of people using day services in Hampshire and Poole. \"With more and more people moving out of 24-hour care into more independent living, these courses are increasingly important,\" says Bennett.</p> <p>Three years ago, she approached Streetwise, which is primarily to train local children, with the idea of using it for people with learning disabilities. The scheme is being evaluated by a team of people with learning difficulties and researchers from Bournemouth University. Advance hopes to rename the scheme Coast to Coast if it secures funding to work with other training centres.</p>",
  "<p>After years of disruptive behaviour, Damien was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of 12. At 16, he and his mother were told he could no longer be treated by the child and adolescent mental health team and must transfer to adult services. </p> <p>However, according to his mother, the adult section \"didn't believe\" in ADHD. \"They said you couldn't have it by the age of 16 or 17 and they had no resources for it,\" she recalls. \"They told us they couldn't treat Damien.\" Without medication or support, Damien went downhill. By 19, he was in a young offender institution. </p> <p>Damien and his family are, unfortunately, not alone - and it is not just those with ADHD who are falling through the gap between adolescent and adult provision. Any young person with a mental health problem may find themselves suddenly transferred into an alien environment, perhaps rediagnosed, given new, different or no treatment, and without the support of staff they may have come to rely on. </p> <p>In more than a quarter of health authorities, child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are available only up to the age of 16, yet adult services are considered unsuitable for anyone under 17 or 18. </p> <p>William had his first breakdown at 17, and his most recent at 20. \"My experience of adolescent psychiatry and adult psychiatry are very different,\" he says. \"The former makes an attempt to be therapeutic; it does not blur the line between ill health and criminality [found in adult wards]. Psychotherapy was offered, as well as proper occupational therapy, group therapy and so on. </p> <p>\"A day on an adult ward, by contrast, can seem a very long time. There was little human contact, no psychotherapy. Adult services just offered medication.\" William feels his experiences in the adult services contributed to his subsequent suicide attempt. </p> <p>Swaran Singh, senior lecturer in community psychiatry at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, whose research on the subject is soon to be published by the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Psychiatric Bulletin, says the two services come at mental health from completely different angles. \"Child and adolescent services see the child as part of a family, in a social context, and offer support and mainly talking therapies, with relatively little diagnosis and medication,\" he says. \"Adult services see this as 'mere social work'. They think it fails adequately to medicate cases with potentially serious mental illnesses. They focus on the individual alone, require a clear diagnosis of serious mental illness, and the key treatment is medication.\" </p> <p>There are differences, too, in the conditions considered diagnosable. While some adult services still do not believe in the possibility of ADHD in adulthood (even though an adult clinic exists at the Maudsley hospital, south London), bipolar disorder (manic depression) is often considered only to occur in adults. Psychosis is largely considered an adult problem, while autistic spectrum disorders such as Asperger's syndrome are now recognised as lifelong conditions, but expertise is still concentrated heavily in the child and adolescent sector. </p> <p>The fact is, of course, that teenagers are both child and adult and do not pass neatly from one to the other in 24 hours around a particular birthday. \"An individual's chronological age and developmental age may not be the same,\" says Sue Bailey, a professor of child and adolescent mental health, who was involved in drawing up the mental health section of the government's National Service Framework (NSF) for children, published last month. </p> <p>The framework document, a blueprint for services to be achieved within the next 10 years, admits that many 16 and 17-year-olds are not receiving proper care, and says all CAMHS must be extended to when youngsters reach 18. It admits that transfer is often \"poorly coordinated and patchy,\" that flexibility is required in transfer age, and that training, protocols and multi-agency services should be in place \"to ensure that young people experience a smooth transition\". </p> <p>The problems of adolescents falling through the gap has been publicly acknowledged since 1995, yet little has been done. A survey in 2001 by Clare Lamb, a psychiatrist involved in setting up a transitional team serving 16 to 19-year-olds on the Wirral, found that only 19 areas of England had such transitional services, and Wales had none. </p> <p>The situation is not vastly better today, although a survey this year by Bailey did uncover real concern among clinicians, and a variety of small-scale, unofficial, almost covert, attempts to break down barriers at local level. \"We as clinicians have got to come out of our boxes,\" Bailey says. </p> <p>Lamb, who believes that hard work needs to be put into building relationships between the two services, says: \"They do speak different languages. But with energetic clinicians, realistic resources and a supportive NHS trust, it can be done - and it is crucial that it is done.\" </p> <p>A service for adolescents and young adults should offer a full range of talking treatments as well as the possibility of medication, Lamb says. It should aim to help vulnerable adolescents avoid becoming chronic mental health cases, while detecting and treating the minority who have early onset of specific, severe mental illnesses, and easing their passage into the adult services. </p> <p>How best to do this is the subject of a services development project by the Health and Social Care Advisory Service, and funded by the Department of Health. This aims to bring together practitioners from around the country to share experiences and identify the most successful models of practice before testing them in pilot projects. </p> <p>In the meantime, a handful of clinics set up as a result of the adult NSF for mental health five years ago are beginning to show that adult and child psychiatrists can work together. Early-onset psychosis clinics are designed to deal with first episodes of psychosis in people in their teens and 20s. They necessarily span the transition age and force CAMHS and adult psychiatrists to work together. </p> <p>Singh has started such a clinic in south London and is in no doubt that it is helping to improve communication and cooperation. He and many others hope this is a first step towards bridging the gap, ensuring that young people like Damien end up in appropriate mental health services, rather than in the criminal justice system. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some names have been changed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Read the National Service Framework for mental health at <a href=\"http://www.publications.doh.gov.uk/nsf/mentalhealth.htm\">www.publications.doh.gov.uk/nsf/mentalhealth.htm</a>.</p>",
  "Don't say \"professionalisation\", insists the cabinet secretary sternly. Civil servants are already professionals, but, Sir Andrew Turnbull argues, they never thought it necessary to put a framed certificate on the wall, saying MBA, or member of the Institute of Bankers, or whatever. <p>\"Professionalism is not the exclusive preserve of those disciplines where it is possible to earn letters after one's name,\" says Turnbull, who seems determined to leave as one of his memorials long-lasting changes in the Whitehall skill set. (It is widely assumed, though he won't say, that he would retire next September, provided the general election is held in May.)</p> <p>At a think-in for several hundred officials at a London hotel last week, he unveiled a new scheme. Drafted by a committee led by Sir Richard Mottram, permanent secretary in the Department for Work and Pensions, it involves reskilling the entire civil service. Turnbull does not demur when you prompt him with phrases such as accreditation revolution - though it will take years to work through the system.</p> <p>In future, civil servants must pass through \"gateways\" before setting foot on the next rung of the career ladder. They will have to show they can deliver services and master such corporate skills as finance, statistics and human relations. These gateways will loom at the point of entry to the senior civil service, and again on admission to departmental boards. The gateways will coexist with separate ladders of advancement for specialist accountants, lawyers and scientists.</p> <p>As a result, the terrain of competence in Whitehall is being mapped. Anne Gregory, president of the Institute of Public Relations, has been brought in to review how government press officers are trained. Operational delivery (what big outfits such as the Inland Revenue do) has been given its own \"head of profession\". He is Ian Magee, a social security wizard who is now chief executive for operations (mainly the courts) in the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p> <p>There will not be specific numbers for staff who have to train in finance, the law, statistics or other specialisms; nor will the Cabinet Office be laying down curricula. Turnbull presents the change as a more gradual move to boost the stock of professional skills for government. \"It's another brick in the edifice of modernisation,\" he says.</p> <p>There is another, intriguing new title that Turnbull has just dispensed. He has created the job of head of profession for policy, to be filled by Sir Brian Bender, permanent secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and formerly in the Cabinet Office. This is an altogether new departure, policy never before having been recognised as a separate territory.</p> <p>The thinking here is both positive and negative. It is about time Whitehall stood up and extolled its own \"traditional\" skill set, including providing ministers with advice. Our own fault, says Turnbull. The skills and leadership needed to negotiate an international treaty or to write then shepherd a piece of legislation through parliament have lacked \"parity of esteem\" with operational and delivery skills.</p> <p>Those older qualities are to be revalidated. To get to the top, civil servants will need to be good at \"political management\", working with ministers and policy advice. No, he does not think that young civil servants should have a master's degree in public administration. But he adds: \"We need to make clear that managing the processes of government, preparing a policy document, delivering public accountability through parliamentary questions and correspondence all require as much professionalism as drawing up the resource accounts or providing scientific advice.\"</p> <p>Turnbull is evidently fed up with outside attacks on \"the generalist culture\". A key document in the debate is a committee of inquiry into the civil service set up 36 years ago by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson and chaired by university vice-chancellor John Fulton. It lambasted Whitehall arrogance and amateurism and did lead to the abolition of the class distinctions that had kept clerks away from the \"first division\". The union for senior civil servants still calls itself the First Division Association.</p> <p>Turnbull says the Fulton inquiry failed because the reformers of the late 1960s \"overplayed their hand\". Change has, instead, to be internally generated.</p> <p>So the civil servant of the future will be neither a generalist nor a specialist. The labels have dogged Whitehall for years. \"One too easily morphs into the Fulton tag of the gifted amateur, drifting rapidly and superficially from one subject to another,\" Turnbull says. \"The specialist tag has too often contributed to a sense of isolation.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Walker edits Public, the Guardian's magazine for public executives.

  "<p>Carbon dioxide emissions will be almost 40% higher by the end of the decade than they were in 1990 despite growing use of renewable energy, the International Energy Agency said yesterday. </p> <p>It predicted world energy demand will rise by 60% between now and 2030, with two-thirds of the increase coming from developing countries. Although the agency said energy resources will be able to meet demand until 2030 it warned that countries in Europe, Asia and North America will become increasingly reliant on supplies of oil from the Middle East. </p> <p>\"The Earth contains more than enough energy resources to meet demand for many decades to come. The world is not running out of oil just yet,\" the IEA's executive director Claude Mandil said yesterday. </p> <p>However rising gas and oil prices, the increasing vulnerability of supply routes and ever increasing emissions of climate destablising carbon dioxide are \"symptoms of a considerable malaise in the world of energy\". </p> <p>The IEA forecast of increasing dependence on Middle East oil came as Sadad al-Husseini, a former director of the Saudi oil company Aramco, warned that American projections of his country's production capacity were \"a dangerous overestimate\". </p> <p>He told Channel 4 news: \"Yes the kingdom has huge reserves - 260bn barrels - but they are finite. </p> <p>\"So the faster you use them, the more you deplete them.\" </p> <p>According to the IEA's World Energy Outlook the rise in global energy demand will require investment of $16 trillion between 2003 and 2030. </p> <p>Although renewable energy sources will be the fastest growing sector, they will still account for only 2% of world demand by 2030. </p> <p>Gas demand will double and coal will rise by 50%. Oil consumption will increase by 1.6% a year to 90m barrels a day in 2010 and 121m barrels a day by 2030. Nuclear power will grown only slightly. </p> <p>\"These trends are, however, not unalterable. Our analysis shows that more vigorous government action could steer the world on to a markedly different energy path,\" said Mr Mandil. </p> <p>The IEA's alternative policy scenario shows energy demand 10% lower and carbon dioxide emissions 16% lower. </p> <p>\"Achieving a truly sustainable energy system will depend on technological breakthroughs that radically alter how we produce and use energy,\" said Mr Mandil. </p> <p>Even so, energy imports and emissions would still be higher in 2030 than today and would still be growing.</p>",
  "<p>Illegal fly-tipping is so widespread that organised crime is moving in to the market to make quick profits, the Environment Agency warned yesterday. </p> <p>Revealing plans for a \u00a319m law enforcement programme, the agency's chief executive, Lady Young, called for more effective sentences for those convicted of dumping hazardous waste. </p> <p>Increases in landfill taxes and a reduction in the number of legitimate sites were fuelling rapid expansion in the black market for clandestine rubbish disposal, which was even being exploited by mainstream building contractors, she said. </p> <p>Last year there were more than 5,000 serious cases of illegal dumping. </p> <p>Speaking at the Environment Agency's annual conference in Birmingham, Lady Young said: \"As the cost of landfill goes up, we want magistrates to be more aware of environmental crime. We want to have more flexible punishments - for example, community service orders for firms that do not get their act together.\" </p> <p>One home counties police force is examining whether it can use anti-social behaviour orders against persistent fly-tippers. </p> <p>The agency has submitted a bid for \u00a319m over four years to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The money would be used to recruit more staff to catch fly-tippers, support local authorities which pursue prosecutions, coordinate intelligence about illegal operators and establish a register of legitimate rubbish disposal firms. </p> <p>Martin Brocklehurst, the head of waste strategy at the Environment Agency, said that while the average fine was \u00a32,500, small illegal operators could make \u00a3100,000 a year from fly-tipping.</p>",
  "<p>When the Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg published The Skeptical Environmentalist, in 2001, a lot of illiberal governments, far-right thinktanks and free-market intellectuals cheered loudly. Here was a sharp young European professor of statistics who called himself a leftwing environmentalist but was articulating precisely what they had been saying for years. </p> <p>According to Lomborg - and this is to only slightly paraphrase him - the global environment wasn't really in that bad a state; climate change was not a great problem, and would cost far too much to address; green groups deliberately overstated their case; scientists had got it wrong about everything from biodiversity to oil depletion; and all the 1970s talk about resources running out was hokum. </p> <p>The book provoked an academic storm, and green thinkers around the world argued that his sweeping generalisations played loose with complex subjects. It was open season on Lomborg as he was hailed and vilified in roughly equal measure. </p> <p>\"Yes, the reaction it produced was a shock,\" says Lomborg, in London to launch an equally controversial book on how to best spend money to help the poor. \"A lot of my friends did not talk to me for a while, and a lot of people I did not like wanted to be my friend. Yet I consider myself part of the left wing.\" </p> <p>As the storm passed, Lomborg emerged, if not vindicated then at least exonerated. He became respected for challenging the frequently self-righteous environment movement. Slowly, he says, his ideas have begun to seep through. Today, The Skeptical Environmentalist is on school curricula and governments call him for advice. Time magazine, this year named him as one of world's most influential people. </p> <p>His new book demands to be taken seriously. It is is a 640-page treatise by America's leading free market economists, including three Nobel prize winners, who Lomborg brought together to consider how to spend a notional $50bn (\u00a327.4bn) in four years for the best use of humanity. Lomborg has only edited the work, but from his foreword and analysis it is clear he agrees with their findings. </p> <p>They unanimously said that it made sense to prioritise \"do good\" spending: top of their cost-benefit list was HIV/Aids, then came malnutrition and water, and then - surprise! - came the promotion of free trade policies round the world. If that wasn't \"rightwing\" enough, right at the bottom of the list of world priorities came climate change, which they all said was a waste of time and money trying to sort out. Coincidentally, this was precisely the argument Lomborg himself had made in The Skeptical Environmentalist. </p> <p>But had not he handpicked these mostly American free trade-supporting economists, knowing their line? Why was there only one representative of a developing country? Why was this \"dream team\" so intellectually homogenous and why were they asked to consider only what was the best use of spending money for four years, when something like climate change was clearly a long-term problem? </p> <p>In other words, was it - as Greenpeace and others have said - crude, illiterate, ecologically and ethically and politically loaded? </p> <p>Lomborg says no. He says the world's best economists are American, but they did try to get others. \"We talked to Jeffrey Sachs and Joseph Stiglitz, but they were not available,\" he says. \"The question [we posed] was: should the [team] be representative of the profession or of the world? We felt they should be academically the best. I was surprised by the consensus they reached. I thought global warming would have been higher up the list.\" </p> <p>But he then makes the kind of blanket statement that has so infuriated scientists. \"I honestly do not think that the problems are happening with global warming,\" he says. \"The hurricanes and floods are not primarily caused by global warming. Yes, global warming is going to be a problem, but let's not overplay it. I'm not sure it's getting worse, but it is being picked up more by the media. It's not about how bad it is, but how much less bad we can make it.\" </p> <p>While he accepts that climate change is real, he says it is too far in the future to worry about now. He does not accept the evidence put forward last week by Britain's leading environment and development groups, and supported by the head of the UN's panel on climate change, that weather patterns are changing and that subsistence farmers are being made destitute. And he rejects the kind of British government scenario stated yesterday by the Energy Savings Trust that global warming could bring outbreaks of tropical dengue fever, West Nile virus and malaria. </p> <p>His central argument is that money should be invested only when it can be shown to bring certain, observable returns. And because, he says, it will cost some $150bn a year to meet the Kyoto targets on climate change, it is imperative that the world finds out if this vast amount of money could be spent elsewhere to save millions of lives immediately jeopardised by malaria, HIV, malnutrition or water shortages. \"I'm simply asking: 'Can we spot things we can better spend the money on in the third world?' Greenpeace and others say: 'Let's help the third world by doing something about global warming.' That is such a first world view. All the models show that signing up to Kyoto will do nothing.\" </p> <p>So what is the difference between the positions of Lomborg and US president George Bush, both of whom agree that climate change is not a priority and that free trade is best for everyone? </p> <p>\"I am saying that we should do the right things,\" Lomborg says. \"The rightwing is not interested in doing them. We [the left] should pick the right fights. It's a question of do you want to do good or do you want to make it easier for industry. Should you [try to] save 10,000 or 10 million people? The rightwing is just ignoring all the problems. We want to do real good instead of making money for corporations.\" </p> <p>In Britain, he says, it is pretty clear that money should be prioritised to improve air pollution, which he says is killing 46,000 people a year. Too many resources, he suggests, are being spent on things such as pesticide residues. </p> <p>\"I think I am misused by both sides,\" Lomborg says. \"But that's democracy. Bush [and the right] latch on to anything that makes life cheap, but the environment movement does not want to hear what the best thing to do is. I can understand why. You get more political influence if you can paint things into a great problem. Bush needs to be forced to spend more on HIV and water, but the environment movement must learn to prioritise. </p> <p>\"We have to look at what we can do about problems. It's legitimate to ask how much will something cost and how much good will it do. As long as we don't get our priorities right, the right will have a field day. It's best to get these questions out of the way, to move on. </p> <p>\"The bottom line is that we can only spend our money once, so let's spend it well. In any other policy area, that's obvious, but the environment arena is relatively new and hasn't matured yet.\"</p>",
  "<p>Almost half of the world lives on less than $2 (\u00a31.10) a day. For each dollar the west gives in aid to developing countries, it takes back $2. The United Nations estimates that third world nations are denied about $700bn annually because of unjust trade rules. Meanwhile, rich countries, with only 15% of the world's population, generate half of the world's carbon dioxide emissions and use half of the world's energy. </p> <p>That is the bad news. The good news is that it is possible to do something about it. </p> <p>1. The way you spend your money can change lives. Martin Luther King said: \"Before you finish eating breakfast this morning, you've depended on more than half the world.\" So, wake up and smell the fair trade coffee. Fair trade bucks the free market to give a bigger share of profits to producers. Small producers in developing countries receive a guaranteed price, including a small social premium, to help them survive in a global trading system where the odds are stacked against them. The Fairtrade Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk\">www.fairtrade.org.uk</a>) labels more than 250 products, and sales are now about \u00a3100m a year. </p> <p>2. Your wallet can be a powerful weapon in the war against inequality. Sales of ethical goods and services in Britain stand at about \u00a37bn, according to the Co-operative Bank (<a href=\"http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk\">www.co-operativebank.co.uk</a>), and more than half of shoppers now switch brands or boycott a product for ethical reasons. </p> <p>3. Join the growing number of consumers calling on multinational corporations to be more responsible. Let them know why you are unhappy with them so they can correct what they are doing wrong. </p> <p>4. Having given your spending cash a conscience, make sure you do the same with savings. If you do not like tobacco companies' attempts to boost cigarette sales in developing countries, or oil and armament companies' practices, you may be surprised to find that your money could be funding these activities. Your cash in a bank, pension fund or an endowment may have been invested in firms involved in activities you abhor. Find out about your workplace pension fund's investments, and if you disagree about where the money is going, lobby for change. The fund's trustees are legally obliged to tell members about their policy on socially responsible investment. The Ethical Investment Research Service (<a href=\"http://www.eiris.org\">www.eiris.org</a>) is a good source of information. </p> <p>5. If you want to put your savings to work for positive change, switch your account to the Co-op Bank. Also check out Triodos Bank (<a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\">www.triodos.co.uk</a>) and Charity Bank (<a href=\"http://www.charitybank.org\">www.charitybank.org</a>). Here the accent is more on the feelgood factor than the financial return. </p> <p>6. This is Energy Savings Week, so try switching to renewable energy for your electricity supply. It's simple and not a lot more expensive to transfer. The more demand there is for energy from renewable sources such as wind farms, the more supply will be generated. Friends of the Earth (<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk\">www.foe.co.uk</a>) has a list of recommended suppliers. </p> <p>7. Switch to energy-saving light bulbs. They cost more than ordinary bulbs, but last longer. According to the Energy Saving Trust (<a href=\"http://www.est.org.uk\">www.est.org.uk</a>), if every home in the UK replaced three bulbs with energy-efficient ones, it would save enough energy to power all the streetlights in the country - saving money and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>8. A shower uses 40% of the hot water needed for a bath, and you save on energy too. A Hippo in your lavatory cistern can save up to three litres of water per flush - about 5,500 litres a year. Look for water saving ideas at Thames Water (<a href=\"http://www.thameswater.co.uk\">www.thameswater.co.uk</a>) </p> <p>9. Donate money to help the billion or more people around the world who do not have access to clean water and the 2 billion-plus who have no proper sanitation. A cash donation to Water Aid (<a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org\">www.wateraid.org</a>) will assist its efforts to get water, sanitation and hygiene education to some of the poorest people in the world. </p> <p>10. Each household in Britain produces more than a tonne of waste annually. About 80% ends up in landfill sites, but up to three-quarters of it could be recycled or composted. Wastewatch (<a href=\"http://www.wastewatch.org.uk\">www.wastewatch.org.uk</a>) promotes and encourages action on the three Rs - reduction, reuse and recycling. </p> <p>11. Buy recycled products where possible. As demand for recycled products increases, more waste can be recycled. On top of that, recycled paper production, for example, uses only about half the energy needed to make virgin paper. Recycling specialist Remarkable (<a href=\"http://www.remarkable.co.uk\">www.remarkable.co.uk</a>) produces an interesting range of environmentally friendly stationery. </p> <p>12. Tourism can be a force for good, providing employment in poor countries, but it can also be immensely destructive. Aircraft are a rapidly increasing source of greenhouse gas emissions. For trips closer to home, the train is a far more environmentally friendly way of getting around. If you must fly, consider giving a small donation to a local transport group or environmental advocacy organisation. Tourism Concern (<a href=\"http://www.tourismconcern.org.uk\">www.tourismconcern.org.uk</a>) has pioneered the concept of ethical tourism, raising awareness of the effects holidays can have on communities, economies and the environment. If everybody does a little, it could help to change a lot.

  "<p>Since September 1, every computer- related glitch in British public life has been Ian Watmore's fault. The government's new chief information officer says that, unlike his predecessor the e-Envoy, he has a mandate to look at IT throughout the public sector, including in local authorities.</p> <p>\"The government sees my role as a wider public sector role, not as a central government one, and I want to work actively and cooperatively with local government,\" he says. </p> <p>Watmore's arrival marks several big changes for the Cabinet Office's e-team, based near Victoria station in London. As the Office of the e-Envoy, its main job was getting Britons to use the internet. Its e-government responsibilities were monitoring progress towards the 2005 target, setting standards and running shared systems. </p> <p>Watmore's Office of the Head of e-Government inherits the e-government targets, together with responsibility for \"back office\" systems right across government. The aim is to provide the IT to underpin massive efficiency savings set out in the current public spending round.</p> <p>This is a big cultural shift for both the man and his organisation. Watmore, at 46, is new to the public sector, though he says his 23 years with Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) gave him experience with large government IT programmes. Like his colleague Richard Granger, the NHS's IT chief, Watmore is a veteran of the gruelling process to computerise systems at the former Department of Social Security.</p> <p>Watmore cheerfully admits that local government is a new area. \"It's not an area in which I personally have a lot of background and experience, so I'm keen to listen,\" he says. Watmore adds that he has publicly recognised local government's role as an innovator. \"I've often said that local government led central government. The notion of compulsory competitive tendering started in local government in the 80s and reached Whitehall in the 90s. The first significant public sector outsourcing strategy in the world, full stop, started in UK local government,\" he says.</p> <p>The top item on Watmore's agenda is his role as a \"change agent\" in Sir Peter Gershon's efficiency review of the public sector. \"This is not a theoretical exercise - it will happen.\" He has two roles. One is to look at the way government buys and runs its IT. This involves working with the Treasury's Office of Government Commerce to turn government into a \"smart customer\" of IT.</p> <p>The other role is to support government-wide corporate services, starting with human resources and finance. While the office of e-government's role is \"still evolving\", he says that individual departments will probably continue to procure these systems. But they will be supported by Watmore's office. \"We have to find ways of supporting the process team leaders in those areas with top-class HR and financial system support,\" he says.</p> <p>This means making sure government doesn't try to step beyond what is technologically possible. \"We want to ensure that we are creating business process templates that, if people were to execute them, they would naturally find good software out there.\" </p> <p>Watmore's staff are going through their own cultural change. The office is shedding its responsibilities for closing the digital divide, now the responsibility of the Department for Education and Skills. Work on e-democracy will transfer to the Department for Constitutional Affairs. On the other hand, Watmore says he is building up skills in \"back office\" services such as human resources and payroll, identified as an early target for efficiency savings.</p> <p>Watmore is not planning to run these services, but he is determined to ensure that the software on which they depend is up to the job. \"It is an easily made mistake to over-engineer what you want and find that the software packages out there don't fit, so you either scale back your ambitions or custom-build on the core package and end up with some clunky system that doesn't deliver what you want,\" he says. </p> <p>Another priority is to increase the take up of self-service government. This was already seen as a logical part of the 2005 e-government target. It is likely to receive new attention under Watmore. \"I think the 2005 targets were fundamentally about getting a broad array of services available online,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I think what we want to do next is get that high take-up and high impact of the services that really matter and which touch people's lives.\" One example is the online filing of self-assessment tax returns. Although the number of people who file electronically is now growing, it lags well behind the rate in leading e-government countries such as Canada.</p> <p>The main engine for self-service government will continue to be the Directgov portal, Watmore says. He intends to build on the existing \"franchise\" model, where themed content for the site is provided by outside agencies. But he's in no hurry to promote the site. \"I think it's a brand that will grow over time and, as we get more franchises involved, it will go up its own maturity curve, so it will start slow and accelerate as more and more things come into the mainstream,\" Watmore says. </p> <p>\"There may be a marketing strategy, but I'm not going to invest huge dollars - I'm sorry, huge pounds - in advertising while we're still driving the concept down.\"</p> <p>But whatever the take-up of self-service government, Watmore says that for the forseeable future, many citizens will depend on contact with frontline public servants. Here, his role is to provide the best possible IT. This could be done through projects along the lines of the NHS national programme for IT, which is spending \u00a36bn on new standard systems. If any such programmes are launched, Watmore expects his office to play a key role. </p> <p>\"I think we would be part of getting such a programme understood, that people want to do it, believe in it, get the funding agreed, get the buy-in, get the leadership to run it and all the rest of it,\" he says. </p> <p>One area of e-government strategy likely to be revived by Watmore is encouraging the role of \"intermediaries\" in electronic services. The idea is to encourage voluntary organisations and private firms to offer public services to their customers. The policy is languishing because of difficulties with sharing costs and data. Watmore says the time is right to revive it.</p> <p>One example would be car insurance companies renewing tax discs. However, Watmore says he is also looking at the role of \"intermediaries\" within the public sector, along the lines of the Pensions Agency's call-centre staff.</p> <p>His plan is to encourage new ideas, and spread news of good practice. \"When we have a success, let's not go over the top, but let's at least celebrate it and try to get other people to feel confident about following that,\" he says.</p> <p>Watmore is also responsible for finding central solutions to the knottiest problems of e-government, security, authentication and privacy. Authentication will be a long slog, even if the ID card project gets under way on schedule. \"It's complicated because of the breadth of service providers, and because of the scale of the challenge - it's got to handle 60 million citizens,\" Watmore says. \"Not many companies in the world have 60 million customers, so there's not a lot of practice to pull from. Then you've got the practicality in getting from here to there.\"</p> <p>Simply issuing electronic identities to citizens will take years, if not decades, because of the cycles of renewal of existing documents such as passports and drivers' licences. On privacy and security, there are no easy answers. \"The role we have here is to sponsor that which is obviously a difficult balance between security and usability,\" Watmore says. \"It's quite a subtle balance and will be taken case by case, but I do see my role overarchingly as one of trying to get that strategic policy environment set in which people operate, and trying to get that security- privacy balance right.\"</p> <p>He will also be under pressure to resolve another emotive issue: whether the government should promote the use of open-source software. \"To be honest, I've not even looked at that yet, so I've got no comment,\" Watmore says. \"The only thing I would say is that I am a pragmatist in these things. I believe in pragmatism in these issues, and in pragmatism in getting the balance right between short- and long-term solutions on IT directions. Most importantly, IT is only enabling some more important change. Let's do the pragmatic thing, make the important change. It's more important to have better healthcare and better education than to have a theological debate about these things.\"</p> <p>It's difficult for all concerned, especially as Watmore was planning to produce his first strategic plan for e-government by the end of this month. And some of his staff have had to make their own cultural adjustments: learning to cope with his fondness for footballing metaphors for instance. Watmore is a serious Arsenal supporter.</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Directgov portal:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk\">www.direct.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Design Council:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.designcouncil.org.uk\">www.designcouncil.org.uk</a></p>",

  "<p><strong>Glyn Evans</strong></p> <p>Director of IT, Birmingham city council</p> <p><strong>The Gershon report, and the chancellor's response to it, places heavy emphasis on e-government delivering major efficiency savings - is this realistic?</strong></p> <p>Investment to deliver e-government should always be about efficiency gains as well as service improvement. With the technologies currently available to us, linked with changes in business processes and the way that people are deployed to deliver services, we really do have the potential to improve services while delivering savings.</p> <p>If the application of ICT has the potential to deliver (very significant) efficiency savings, then, as Gershon says, we should be exploiting it. What is done with the efficiency savings is of course a political decision - they can be ploughed back into the service or they can be used to reduce taxation.</p> <p>For local government, the focus of e-government has been on service improvement rather than efficiency gains. Local authorities have, by our own estimates, spent \u00a32.5bn on e-government, but in IEG statements we have so far committed to total savings of just \u00a380m.</p> <p>There is a danger that the impact of Gershon will be to swing the pendulum back too far in the opposite direction and that, as the Treasury seeks its efficiency payback, the service improvement goal will be lost.</p> <p>The Gershon report also takes a central government-centric view of the potential for efficiency gains from the application of IT to government services. The same potential is not always applicable to services delivered by local government. Most central government services are high volume and require limited functionality in the systems which deliver them.</p> <p>In contrast, many local government services (think housing benefit or social care) are complex, require the application of professional judgement at stages in the process, and need to be delivered differently according to the social and economic circumstances that apply in each local authority.</p> <p>Given that local authorities deliver up to 80% of all government services, it would be dangerous to assume that potential savings from IT applications in central government can be extrapolated to local government.</p> <p>So while Gershon is a timely reminder that we need to make sure that the opportunities to achieve efficiencies through local e-government are realised, we must also hold tightly on to the objective of delivering local government services which are more joined up, responsive and focused on the needs of individuals.</p> <p><strong>Jos Creese</strong></p> <p>Head of IT service at Hants CC and chair of Socitm Insight</p> <p><strong>Is open-source software now a realistic option?</strong></p> <p>Any technology promising significant savings in IT costs and an escape from the lock-in of proprietary solutions has to be attractive to IT managers who are struggling to deliver \"more for less\" and to escape the clutches of big suppliers.</p> <p>In fact, many organisations are already using some open-source technology such as Linux, although typically for the back office. Microsoft is well aware of the open-source competitive threat and is responding. Licensing costs are only a part of the total costs of ownership of desktop tools other costs include for example:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> training costs (more choice, training providers in Microsoft tools);</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> end-user perceptions (the majority may already use Microsoft tools at home);</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> integration costs (most suppliers build Microsoft technology interfaces);</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> ongoing product development and support.</p> <p>In considering the costs of ownership of proprietary and open-source desktop tools, they're not so different.</p> <p>On balance, I expect to see a growing use of open-source tools for the back office but a much slower adoption at the desktop because of risk, costs and product familiarity.</p> <p><strong>Tim Dawes</strong></p> <p>Director of Nineveh Consulting</p> <p><strong>Should we allow individual departments to buy document management/ workflow systems or insist on a corporate solution?</strong></p> <p>The time has come when most public authorities should at least consider having a corporate strategy for DM/Workflow and, in most cases, this will involve a single technical solution at the core of the strategy. After all, a few years ago we were arguing as to whether departments should be allowed to operate their own favoured office systems and networks. Now almost everyone accepts a corporate standard in these areas is necessary. Why? Because they allow everyone to communicate freely, make it easy for people to change roles within the organisation and reduce radically the cost of support.</p> <p>The same arguments are made for corporate DM/Workflow. However, implementing single corporate solutions for DM/Workflow in local government is not at all straightforward.</p> <p>Many leading business application solutions (social services, revenues, planning etc.) have embedded workflow functionality that's fundamental to the way they work. If you make the use of a specific workflow package mandatory in all circumstances, you will automatically disqualify a whole set of best-of-breed software.</p> <p>It follows that some flexibility will be necessary. Mandating a standard document management solution is more practical as most local government package suppliers will interface with the leading local government DM software.</p> <p>The extent to which you mandate corporate standards must be driven by the future needs of your authority. If your authority is looking to facilitate full-generic working in its contact centres, it won't find a menagerie of incompatible DM/Workflow helpful.</p> <p><strong>Nick Chapallaz</strong></p> <p>Government strategy manager at ESRI (UK)</p> <p><strong>Will my authority need an enterprise-wide geographic information system (GIS) to comply with priority outcomes?</strong></p> <p>Yes. The ODPM has already recommended that to achieve \"good\" outcomes in two priority service areas - the local environment and transport - departments should provide the public with access to GIS-based property and roadwork related information. The Improvement and Development Agency's guidance document states that GIS is a required component for all priority service outcomes.</p> <p>There are many opportunities to see how authorities are successfully using GIS to help citizens understand \"what's happening where\". For example, the website of East Riding of Yorkshire, winner of the Socitm award for IT excellence, hosts Gofer (GIS Online for East Riding) with access to maps of many local services. Westminster city council's interactive web map provides a similar service also using GIS. Other portals use GIS to allow citizens to report the location of incidents.</p> <p>GIS is about more than just interactive maps on local authority portals. Considering that over 80%of local authority data has a geographical element, GIS should be about underpinning all business processes within an authority, from financial and citizen relationship management to revenues and benefits and planning. All of these areas use geographical data, whether it is locating property, roads, parking offences or criminal damage.</p> <p>Implementing a GIS across all areas of the local authority can help achieve priority services and more - not only unlocking data, but helping the authority to reap the benefits offered by e-government.</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>National Workflow project: </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.workflownp.org.uk\">www.workflownp.org.uk</a></p> <p>GIS online for East Riding:<br> <a href=\"http://www.eastriding.gov.uk/gis/index.html\">www.eastriding.gov.uk/gis/index.html</a></p> <p>Wiltshire and Swindon pathfinder map browser:<br> <a href=\"http://www.maps-direct.co.uk/waspathfinder\">www.maps-direct.co.uk/waspathfinder</a> </p> <p>Westminster city council GIS web map:</p> <p><a href=\"http://maps.westminster.gov.uk\">maps.westminster.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>After freak storms, life can become stressful for local authorities. Violently uprooted trees can block a path, hang dangerously over someone's property or even injure a person.</p> <p>Faced with short-tempered callers and working with paper files, council staff can find it tough to pinpoint the location of any problem trees, often nagged by the thought that it might not be the council's responsibility to deal with them in the first place.</p> <p>Conserving trees and managing parks and assorted plots of land is a complex operation. Hedgerows and grassy areas often need to be cut at fixed intervals to precise lengths. This is work that requires close liaison with external contractors. Any signs of neglect can - and often do - spark heated local disputes. Hardly surprising, then, that authorities such as East Hertfordshire district council have decided to invest in a hi-tech grounds-maintenance system to help.</p> <p>\"This allows us to manage how we order work from our contractors,\" says Shirley Clark, the council's assistant director for direct and contract services. \"A lot of our grounds maintenance is pre-planned, and there is additional work that needs to be done seasonally.\"</p> <p>East Hertfordshire regularly cuts hedgerows and grass verges, and often someone complains that a stretch has been missed. But the electronic system, directly linked with contractors, is now helping to resolve any disputes.</p> <p>\"Complaint information entered on the system is instantly with our contractors. It speeds up their response time,\" Clark says. The new technology also enables East Hertfordshire's grounds-maintenance staff to track precisely the work being carried out on particular groups of trees or on certain stretches of land.</p> <p>\"You can get a random generation of work done over the last few days and target inspection resources,\" Clark says. \"It takes an old paper-based system and makes it faster. If you have had problems, it allows us to look back at it on a geographical basis, and we can see how we performed the service.\"</p> <p>The fact that grounds-maintenance work can be digitised has enabled East Hertfordshire to make information available to local councillors through its intranet.</p> <p>\"If a councillor was having a ward surgery and someone said there is a piece of land between our property and no one seems to be looking after it, the councillor is able to check online to see if East Hertfordshire is responsible for that land,\" Clark says. \"They can then arrange for officers to inspect it - and it makes them much more informed.</p> <p>\"It could be a conservation area where the grass is not cut frequently. The councillors can now interact with the citizens in a more informed way rather than keep going back to officers. It is supporting their role in local wards.\"</p> <p>Hull city council has also invested in a computerised grounds-maintenance system that monitors everything from weeding flower beds to marking sports pitches and cutting bowling greens.</p> <p>Mike McWilliams, development and support manager for Hull's park and gardens, says the system stores an easily accessible history of the restoration work carried out. This is valuable information if the council, say, receives a claim for compensation should someone fall while walking on a path it owns. The history helps to give an audited account of what work the council has done over the years on particular pathways.</p> <p>With a total of 1,183 hectares of open space to maintain, McWilliams says the new technologies give a fuller and more open picture of activities being undertaken. \"You know exactly what land you have got and what you are doing on that land,\" he says. \"It's only as good as the information you put in it. But it's making sure everyone understands the areas that have been covered. It handles a lot of repetitive work and it releases you to look at more qualitative activities such as how you want to improve a site.\"</p> <p>The system enables Hull to plot the assets it manages as overlays on the top of an Ordnance Survey map. The council can shade individual features in different colours so they can be identified quickly.</p> <p>Mark Clarke, managing director of Mayrise Systems, says ground-maintenance technologies mean that councils can be more responsive to customer queries. \"I think they can save money but it's difficult to quantify. Councils can show they are more efficient and they can get to their information quicker,\" he says. \"The systems can record the locations of trees along highways for example. A lot of authorities don't know the trees they are responsible for.\"</p> <p>The Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management has welcomed the introduction of new technologies as a way of improving grounds maintenance in the public sector. However, Alan Barber, a member of the institute's park, places and countryside executive, says the systems are not especially creative. \"The software cannot do the thinking for them.\"</p> <p>Barber adds that council grounds-maintenance staff still need to do work to show the social benefits of parks that support a diverse range of plants and wildlife. \"We need to know how public parks and green spaces benefit people in order to continue to justify higher standards of maintenance,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>East Hertfordshire district council: <br><a href=\"http://www.eastherts.gov.uk\">www.eastherts.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Hull city council: <br><a href=\"http://www.hullcc.gov.uk\">www.hullcc.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Mayrise Systems: <br><a href=\"http://www.mayrise.co.uk\">www.mayrise.co.uk</a></p> <p>Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management: <br><a href=\"http://www.ilam.co.uk\">www.ilam.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>WPP, the world's second largest advertising company, warned of an uncertain 2005 yesterday as it disclosed that its third-quarter revenues were better than analysts had expected. </p> <p>The parent company of agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, said it was on track to hit its full-year operating margin target of at least 13.8%, with new business coming in \"at an unprecedented level\". </p> <p>WPP predicted global advertising market growth of 2%-3% next year, down from 3%-4% this year. WPP confirmed a buoyant short-term outlook, however. Like-for-like revenues, excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, grew 5.7%. Reported revenues, which are in sterling and include acquisitions and currency effects, rose 3.7% to \u00a31.068bn. </p> <p>The figures excluded Grey Global, the US advertising agency which WPP agreed to buy for $1.3bn (\u00a3710m) in September subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. </p> <p>WPP expects the deal to be completed in early 2005. Sir Martin Sorrell, the WPP chief executive, said Grey had lost one account since the deal, the print and TV advertising for Mars, but there had been no fallout since. </p> <p>He dismissed reports that Volkswagen was on the verge of dropping Grey as its media buyer in Europe and Asia. The carmaker is only reviewing its US account which is operated by French group Havas, Sir Martin said. </p> <p>The WPP chief executive said the Asian market had become more independent from the US and the drag from North America could be mitigated by growth in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America next year. </p> <p>He warned that a slowdown in the American economy would hit advertising growth next year. \"If America slows down, it sneezes and Europe catches cold. But there is less dependence than a few years ago,\" he said. </p> <p>North American revenues, which account for around 40% of group turnover, grew 10.4% on a constant currency basis, with the UK rising 12%, continental Europe growing by 6.8% and Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East improving by 22.4%. </p> <p>Sir Martin added to the debate on the future of French rival Havas by backing the strategy of Vincent Bollore, the corporate raider who has amassed a 22.5% stake in the ailing advertising group. The WPP executive said his group talked \"continuously\" with Mr Bollore, who has declared himself a long-term investor in Havas. </p> <p>Relations between Sir Martin and the Havas chairman, Alain de Pouzilhac, are strained. The executives clashed recently over WPP's claim that it attempted to buy a stake in Havas's media buying unit, the Media Planning Group. Sir Martin again dismissed Mr de Pouzilhac's denials over an approach, saying he made the offer when the executives met at the Davos economic forum in January. </p> <p>\"Alain de Pouzilhac said it [the approach] never came across his desk but he seems to forget a conversation we had in Davos. It may not have come across his desk but it came across his face,\" he said.</p>"
