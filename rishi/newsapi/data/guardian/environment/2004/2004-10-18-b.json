  "<p>Economic crimes such as fraud and corruption are costing British business \u00a340bn a year and the problem is getting worse, according to a report out today. </p> <p>The amount, equivalent to about 4% of Britain's gross domestic product, could be just the tip of the iceberg, according to consultancy RSM Robson Rhodes, which carried out a survey of 100 companies in conjunction with the Home Office and Fraud Advisory Panel.</p> <p>The study shows embezzlement, fraud, money laundering and corruption cost companies \u00a332bn last year, as they spent a combined \u00a38bn trying to tackle the problem.</p> <p>FTSE 100 companies, a quarter of which were interviewed for the survey, suffered losses of about \u00a3500m and all listed companies lost \u00a33bn.</p> <p>In spite of their efforts, 60% of firms expect the problem to get worse over the next three years.</p> <p>Bill Cleghorn, forensic partner at RSM Robson Rhodes, said: \"The \u00a340bn cost to business is staggering and could be just the tip of the iceberg. Economic crime is not just a concern for businesses - ultimately it costs us all.\"</p> <p>The survey shows that, although 93% of businesses agree that the board has ultimate responsibility, only 57% of UK directors believe they have an understanding of the financial cost of economic crime.</p> <p>However, four-fifths of companies are waking up to the potential impact of the problem on their share price and brand image.</p> <p>\"Businesses need to take the risks posed more seriously,\" said Mr Cleghorn. \"Whilst there is no set time for how long boards should spend tackling the issue, they need to research the level of economic crime in their industry sector. They then need to put in place effective systems and controls to prevent it, identify material losses and take action to recover those losses.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Kroll, the global risk consulting company bought in July by Marsh &amp; McLennan, has appointed a Briton, Simon Freakley, as chief executive officer and president.</p>",
  "The abusive treatment of inmates at Guant\u00e1namo Bay was far more widespread than the Pentagon has admitted, according to a new report published yesterday. <p>Many detainees at the US prison camp were \"regularly subjected to harsh and coercive treatment\" over a long period of time, far beyond the isolated cases that have been acknowledged to date, according to the report, which appeared in the New York Times.</p> <p>It quoted sources who once worked at the naval base and who were angry at the treatment dealt out to the prisoners, suspected terrorists from around the world who have been held without charge, most for more than two years.</p> <p>The harsh treatment was intended to persuade inmates to talk, and was matched by incentives to co-operate.</p> <p>One \"regular procedure\" was making prisoners strip to their underwear, sit on a chair while their hands and feet were shackled to a bolt on the ground, while they were subjected to strobe lights, loud music (reportedly by Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine and Eminem) and cold. Such sessions could go on for up to 14 hours, with a few breaks. </p> <p>\"It fried them,\" one official was quoted as saying. Another said: \"They were very wobbly. They came back to their cells and were completely out of it.\"</p> <p>Responding to the report, a Pentagon spokesman, Major Paul Swiergosz, said yesterday: \"We take all allegations of detainee abuse seriously, and ... we've directed several enquiries to be conducted into a number of allegations.\"</p> <p>He pointed to an earlier Pentagon statement stating that: \"Guant\u00e1namo guards provide an environment that is stable, secure, safe and humane. And it is that environment that sets the conditions for interrogators to work successfully and to gain valuable information from detainees because they have built a relationship of trust, not fear.\"</p> <p>Following the revelations earlier this year that torture was used by US military guards at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, the US military held enquiries, which found that a number of harsh interrogation techniques had been approved for use in Guant\u00e1namo by the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, but that they were rarely used.</p> <p>The New York Times allegations suggest instead that the procedures used went beyond those guidelines, which allow interrogators to place detainees \"in a setting that may be less comfortable\" but should not \"constitute a substantial change in environmental quality\".</p> <p>Yesterday's report quoted an intelligence official as saying that much of the harshest interrogation was focused on a \"dirty thirty\" of detainees, thought to represent the best potential sources of intelligence on al-Qaida.</p> <p>However, other reports have suggested that very little, if any, \"actionable\" intelligence has emerged from the more than 600 prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, scores of whom have since been transferred to their home countries without charges.</p> <p>High level al-Qaida captives, like Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and Abu Zubaidah have been held at secret locations in allied countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. Human rights group allege that these high-value prisoners are being held outside US territory to avoid legal obstacles to the use of torture.</p> <p>One military official said yesterday it was not clear when the sources quoted in the report worked at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, suggesting that procedures had recently improved. \"There has been - after detainee abuse allegations, - a number of reviews, so it is important what period is being talked about,\" the official said.</p>",
  "Britons may be unknowingly buying diamonds mined in Sierra Leone, where profits are used to arm militias. Many UK jewellers have conceded they have no real policy on sourcing diamonds. <p>\"Conflict\" or \"blood\" diamonds bought by developed countries have funded guns for child soldiers, provided arms to fight UN peacekeeping forces, and financed several African civil wars, according to Amnesty International. </p> <p>Research by the environment group Global Witness revealed that in the 1990s the Angolan rebel army Unita generated $3.7bn over six years largely by trading illegal gems. </p> <p>And now, almost two years after the diamond industry agreed to a self-regulation system to prevent the trade in diamonds from regions of conflict, many UK jewellers are unable to assure customers that the diamonds they are buying have not been sourced from conflict regions. </p> <p>Members of Amnesty International visited more than 330 high street stores to question them about their diamond policy and found that only 38% of salespeople said they had received training about conflict diamonds. </p> <p>Almost half of the diamond retailers said they could not provide a copy of their company policy on conflict diamonds and more than a fifth said they had no store policy on the issue at all. </p> <p>Leading British jewellery retailers Asprey, Theo Fennell and Debenhams did not respond to letters requesting written information about company policy on conflict diamonds. In the US, Costco Wholesale Corporation, TJ Maxx and Kmart did not respond. </p> <p>The research, also by Global Witness campaigners, shows the diamond industry has not implemented a system of self-regulation which was agreed in January 2003. </p> <p>Under the Kimberley Process - a scheme to banish conflict diamonds from the legal rough diamond trade - three commitments were made. </p> <p>These included a code of conduct and system of warranties being implemented and employees being informed about conflict diamond regulations. </p> <p>The World Diamond Council has also proposed that the industry create a system of warranties for diamonds. Under this system all buyers and sellers of both rough and polished diamonds must provide a warranty saying the diamonds have been bought from a legitimate source and not involved in funding conflict. </p> <p>Susie Sanders, a campaigner for Global Witness, said it was important to keep up the pressure on the industry to stamp out the problem. </p> <p>\"Some progress has been made but the industry is not taking it seriously enough,\" she said. </p> <p>\"There is a lack of systematic monitoring and no penalties for retailers if they do not meet the requirements set out in the Kimberley Process. </p> <p>\"This means there are no consequences if they are found not to be compliant.\" </p> <p>The findings, which Global Witness campaigners say are \"pretty disappointing\" will include research from Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland and will be presented at the World Diamond Congress in New York this week. </p> <p>Amnesty International and Global Witness have now called upon governments to intervene, asking for independent monitoring, rigorous auditing and inspections. </p> <p>The director of Amnesty International UK, Kate Allen, said the diamond industry was not taking the issue of conflict diamonds seriously enough. </p> <p>\"The trade in conflict diamonds has fuelled protracted and bloody wars in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone, destroying nations and costing an estimated 3.7 million lives,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Governments must step in and audit companies to ensure that diamonds are not funding conflict or human rights abuses.\" </p> <p>Those wanting to buy diamonds could make a difference, she said, by insisting on written assurances that they were clean. </p> <p>\"Diamonds may be expensive, but they needn't cost people's lives,\" she said.</p>",

  "<p>The Windsor Report was published today, aiming to set out the Anglican communion's official line on homosexuality and prevent a global schism between conservative and liberal groupings. But, perhaps inevitably, the initial response from the various factions of the global church was not very unified.</p> <p><strong>George Wright</strong></p> <p>The most reverend Frank Griswold, primate of the <a href=\"http://www.ecusa.anglican.org/\">Episcopal Church in the US</a> - which most commentators agree has escaped severe censure for the ordination of Canon Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire - expresses concern that the report suggests \"the containment of differences in the service of reconciliation\".</p> <p>Setting out his thoughts on the <a href=\"http://www.ecusa.anglican.org/3577_ENG_HTM.htm\">Episcopal News Service</a> after a \"first reading\" of the lengthy reports, Bishop Griswold <a href=\"http://www.ecusa.anglican.org/3577_52922_ENG_HTM.htm?menu=undefined\">says</a>: \"One section of the report recommends the development of a covenant to be entered into by the provinces of the Communion. This notion will need to be studied with particular care. </p> <p>\"As we and other provinces explore the idea of a covenant we must do so knowing that over the centuries Anglican comprehensiveness has given us the ability to include those who wish to see boundaries clearly and closely drawn and those who value boundaries that are broad and permeable.\"</p> <p>The <strong>Inclusive Church</strong>, a \"grassroots network\" with a liberal campaigning edge, <a href=\"http://www.inclusivechurch.net/article/details.html?id=28\">says</a> it is \"pleased that the commission has not recommended the suspension or expulsion of the Episcopal Church USA from the Anglican Communion, or called for Bishop Gene Robinson to resign\".

  "Bishops should observe a \"moratorium\" on ordaining any more openly gay clergy after the ordination of a gay canon in the US caused \"deep offence\" among the Anglican community, a key report said today. <p>The Windsor report, compiled by a commission set up by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, called on the US Episcopal church to apologise after \"proper constraints\" were breached in the ordination of Canon Gene Robinson as the Bishop of New Hampshire last year.</p> <p>The ordination of Bishop Robinson, who is openly gay, prompted a crisis in the 70-million strong communion, with hardline African and US bishops threatening to leave a global network that took more than 500 years to create. </p> <p>Conservative bishops had demanded that the US Episcopal church receive tough censure in the report. </p> <p>It was not immediately clear how much the Windsor report would satisfy them, but it said that, until there was an apology from those involved in the ordination of Bishop Robinson, they should consider withdrawing from the functions of the communion. A total of 51 bishops attended Bishop Robinson's ordination. </p> <p>Reacting to the report, the head of the Episcopal Church in the US expressed \"regret\" that the community had split but urged Anglicans to embrace \"differences\" or \"do disservice to our mission\". </p> <p>Frank Griswold, the Presiding Bishop and Primate, said: \"I am obliged to affirm the presence and positive contribution of gay and lesbian persons to every aspect of the life of our church and in all orders of ministry.\" </p> <p>Speaking at Lambeth palace, Dr Williams said there were no \"simple answers\" and announced a group would now be set up to collate reaction to the report from around the world. \"We want voices round the communion to be heard, and we will be putting in place a careful and wide ranging process for gathering responses,\" he said. </p> <p>The Windsor report asked liberals supporting gay clergy to wait for a consensus to be reached on homosexuality, warning that the ongoing fierce debate meant the continuing threat of an irrevocable schism. </p> <p>\"There remains a very real danger that we will not choose to walk together,\" it said. \"Should the call to halt and find ways of continuing in our present communion not be heeded, then we shall have to begin to learn to walk apart.\" </p> <p>The report was written by the Lambeth commission, chaired by the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland, Dr Robin Eames. Lord Eames denied that the report was a fudge, saying its central theme was one of \"healing, not division, reconciliation, not punishment\".</p> <p>As Archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the communion, Dr Williams has been under enormous pressure over the row. He set up the Lambeth commission following a summit of the Anglican primates at the palace last October.</p> <p>Today, he said there should be \"no rush to judgment\" and stressed that unity was the way forward. He called on the communion to do everything possible to meet the \"real and demanding challenges\".</p> <p>Lord Eames said the Episcopal church and the Diocese of New Westminster had also breached the bonds of communion by authorising public rites of blessing for same-sex relationships. </p> <p>He added that the report did not attempt to adjudicate on the issue of homosexuality, and stressed there was \"absolutely no room\" for homophobia in the Christian church. </p> <p>Lord Eames added that every one of the 44 churches of the Anglican communion had a \"legitimate autonomy to organise their own internal affairs and life [but] they are not free to depart unilaterally from a shared faith and discipline without this affecting our ties as a family\".</p> <p>\"We are under pressure,\" he said. \"There are questions to ask and answers to be found. We are on a pilgrimage, and this pilgrimage has its ups and downs, its troughs and its valleys, and its peaks. I do not like to think we are on a helter-skelter meltdown.\" </p> <p>Debate over homosexuality in the church hit the headlines last year, with controversy in the UK centred on the nomination of Dr Jeffrey John, a gay but celibate clergyman, as the Bishop of Reading. Dr John later withdrew his acceptance of the post, instead becoming the Dean of St Albans. </p> <p>Liberals and traditionalists have also clashed over the blessings of same-sex couples in Canada. </p> <p>Rev Martin Reynolds, a spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement, said the movement was \"very saddened by the suggestion that bishops who have been supportive of Gene and supported same-sex blessings should withdraw from the councils of the church\". </p> <p>However, Mr Reynolds said the organisation was \"very happy with the general tone of the report, which is aimed at healing and reconciliation\". He also praised the section of the report saying that the debate over homosexuality had not ended.</p> <p>Mr Reynolds added that the report's demand for an explanation as to why a homosexual could be a religious leader was an excellent opportunity to open dialogue with the church.</p>",
  "<b>What is the row about?</b> <br> There is a bitter division between liberals and conservatives about the issues of gay bishops and blessings of same-sex couples, which is threatening to tear apart the 70-million strong global Anglican communion. <p>The communion is the result of more than 500 years of work to build a network of dioceses around the world. Some see the crisis as analogous to earlier disagreements - for example the row over women bishops - as it centres on how a traditional body such as the Anglican church deals with changing values in the modern world.</p> <p><b>Why has the threat of a schism come now? </b><br> There have probably been differences of opinion inside religions of all types about homosexuality since their inception. Most people would recognise that there must always have been some proportion of clergy who were homosexual. But if they were celibate and secretive over their sexuality, then churches did not have to face the issue. </p> <p>The current problem has erupted because in a changing world, some liberals in the church obviously feel that the time has come for a new approach to homosexuality. </p> <p>The current crisis developed after two events in North America that enraged conservatives. The most contentious was the Episcopal Church of the USA (ECUSA) support for the election of Gene Robinson, an openly gay man in a relationship, as Bishop of New Hampshire.</p> <p>Also controversial was the diocese of New Westminster in Canada decision to allow the blessings of same-sex couples. </p> <p><b>Is anyone threatening to leave the communion? </b><br> Yes. African bishops, who represent the fastest-growing congregations in the world, have warned they will leave the communion unless action is taken against ECUSA. Some hardline dioceses in the US are also threatening to break away.</p> <p><b>How is the UK affected? </b><br> As the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams is the head of the communion. so he is under huge pressure to try to sort the problem out. If the crisis does not improve, he will inevitably face questions about his leadership. </p> <p>The homosexuality debate directly hit the UK last year with the nomination of Dr Jeffrey John, a gay but celibate clergyman, as Bishop of Reading. There was considerable controversy and Dr John withdrew his acceptance of the post and later became the Dean of St Albans instead. </p> <p><b>What has Dr Williams done to tackle the crisis? </b><br> The Lambeth commission was set up following a summit of the Anglican primates at Lambeth palace last October.</p> <p>Although the commission's report (known as the Windsor report), addresses general issues, the splits on homosexual clergy will be the most scrutinised.</p> <p><b>What does the report say? </b> <br> The Windsor report says there should be a moratorium on ordaining any more gay clergy, and it calls on those in ECUSA responsible for Bishop Robinson's ordination to express regret. It says that if there was no apology then they should consider whether they should take part in the functions of the communion. </p> <p>In a nutshell, it asks liberals not to carry out more ordinations or blessings of same-sex unions until there is a consensus in the communion on these issues. </p> <p>The report recognises that the row will continue but urges unity and says that the communion may have to learn to \"walk apart\".</p> <p>The Lambeth commission is chaired by the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland, Dr Robin Eames, who denied that the report was a fudge. He said there was \"absolutely no room\" for homophobia in the Christian church. He said that he did not believe the communion was on course for a \"helter-skelter meltdown\". </p> <p><b>Will the report solve the crisis? What happens next?</b><br> The report may cool the heels of some of the hardline African and US bishops and take some heat out of the situation for the short term. </p> <p>But few will believe the problem will now go away - indeed the report admits this. Some argue that there has already effectively been a split in the communion between liberals and conservatives. </p> <p>Arguably the roots of the crisis are in the sociological and cultural changes in developed countries such as the US and the UK, where attitudes to homosexual people have, broadly, become less prejudiced in recent years. The result of this has forced organised religions to confront the issue. </p> <p>If this trend continues - and there is everyone indication that it will - there will be louder calls for openly gay clergy to be permitted and for religious and civic unions that have equality with those of heterosexual couples. </p> <p>At the same time, there is no sign that conservative elements in the church will abandon their fight against homosexual clergy and same-sex blessings. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see how far ECUSA heeds the Windsor report and how far it pacifies the hardliners.</p>",
  "<p>A Conservative government would put a quota on the number of students who could be awarded A-grades at A-level, scrap AS levels and allow schools to go back to teaching O-levels, moves which the party's leader, Michael Howard, today said would put the \"gold standard\" back into secondary schools. </p> <p>Mr Howard outlined his party's solution to the problem of exams in response to the government-backed Tomlinson report which today proposed to scrap A-levels and GCSEs and introduce a diploma.</p> <p>Signs that the Conservatives are prepared to go head-to-head with the government over the issue of exams reform - and crucially what part A-levels will play - place schools at the heart of the political debate ahead of the general election, expected in May 2005. </p> <p>The Tory proposals include a quota system on grades, which would prevent the escalation of the number of pupils receiving A-grades since the move to fixed marking, whereby an A is allotted a certain fixed standard and whoever reaches it would be eligible. </p> <p>The AS exam would be dropped to make A-levels a two-year course again and students would not be allowed to take multiple resits of their exams. Schools could also opt to take other qualifications available such as the International Baccalaureate or O-levels, which were replaced by GCSEs nearly 20 years ago but are still taken overseas. </p> <p>Unlike in the Tomlinson proposals, which would see a major slimming down of externally marked exams, a Tory government would retain external marking at 16 and launch a major overhaul of the exams watchdog, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA). </p> <p>\"The QCA has become too ardent a defender of every aspect of the present system. That has undermined its position as a credible referee. As a first step, we would overhaul the QCA entirely, so that the exam system is policed by people who are committed to maintain standards,\" the Tory proposals say.</p> <p>In his speech to the Society of Editors in Newcastle this morning, Mr Howard attacked both the government's policy on expanding access to university to 50% of 18-20 year olds as well as the proposal that everyone should leave school with a diploma under their belts. </p> <p>\"The trouble with the current approach - where all should have prizes and more and more people should go to university - is that the genuinely talented and ambitious, from whatever background, lose out and are held back,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This approach is not simply wrong; it will also undermine Britain's long-term competitiveness. I want Britain to be blazing the trail, not lagging behind. I am ambitious for our country. An educated workforce is the key to success in today's highly competitive, global markets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Our schools face three main challenges.</p> <p>First, lack of choice and competition. Second, a decline in school discipline. Third, the whole question of the standard of exams. </p> <p>I have spoken before about the first two of these challenges and set out our plans to give parents the opportunity to choose the best school for their child; to allow good schools to expand; and to give headteachers the power to expel disruptive pupils. </p> <p>It is on the third of these challenges - the standard of exams - that I want to focus today.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to go to a grammar school. I have no doubt at all that I received as good an education as any one in the country, even those in the best public schools. I learned in a disciplined, rigorous environment. I was constantly challenged. And by being challenged, I succeeded. </p> <p>Today, there is widespread debate about exam standards. Some people think that exams have been dumbed down and downgraded. Others believe that pupils have become smarter and teachers better.</p> <p>It is a debate often conducted as a shouting match between two mutually uncomprehending camps, each unwilling to accept that there is any validity in the other's point of view.</p> <p>The truth, of course, lies somewhere in between.</p> <p>The numbers achieving passes and top marks in all exams have been growing steadily - not for seven, but for 20 years. This trend has continued under both Conservative and Labour governments at pretty much the same rate, and there is no obvious difference between the increase before 1997 and the increase since then. </p> <p>So, depending upon your point of view, Labour ministers cannot claim all of the credit - and Conservative ministers cannot escape all of the blame.</p> <p>It was the last Conservative government which introduced the National Curriculum, standard tests, and league tables. At the time, we argued that they would increase school standards. So it would be odd for us now to add a caveat - that they would increase school standards until only 1997. Clearly, these reforms have had a beneficial effect on school grades and continue to do so.</p> <p>Yet, despite all this, serious questions remain. </p> <p>First, there is concern about the number of exams and the impact this has on education as a whole. Many teachers are concerned that pupils face a barrage of exams. Extra curricular activities are crowded out. Teachers have become adept in preparing their pupils for exams. The ability to \"work the system\" - which was once confined to the fee-paying sector - has now become widespread and ruthlessly efficient within the state system too. </p> <p>Then there is the standard of exams themselves. People ask - how can it be sensible for a student, who only gets 45% at a higher level maths GCSE, to be able to walk away with an A grade; or one who only gets 16% to walk away with a pass? And people also ask - why is it that some recent A-level maths papers are in several respects virtually identical to O-level papers set 30 years ago?</p> <p>No wonder some of today's examiners say, for example, that: \"The A-level system has been bankrupted by grade inflation.\" No wonder the former chief examiner, Tony Whelpton, has said: \"Yes, it is easier to get a good result at A-level and GCSE than it used to be.\" </p> <p>We know that employers - and you, as editors, who recruit so many young people - complain that a rising number of school-leavers are functionally innumerate and illiterate. We also know that nearly half of all vice-chancellors are having to lay on remedial courses for first year undergraduates. </p> <p>Let me stress again that I am not querying the hard work or effort of individual pupils. They have to work within the prevailing exam system. </p> <p>But it is not enough for ministers to argue, as the schools minister did earlier this year, that any questioning at all of exam standards is unacceptable or the product of elitist thinking.</p> <p>We must restore public confidence, strengthen the robustness of our exams, rebuild the international reputation of our exam boards, challenge the most able, and provide much more encouragement for those at all levels of ability.</p> <p>Conservatives do not approach these matters in a partisan fashion. We accept our share of responsibility for the present situation, and have consistently made it clear that we will work with others wherever possible in order to find a way forward.</p> <p>We agree that the need for reform of 14 to 19-year-old education is urgent and necessary. Today, the government's working group has published its proposals, some of which are sensible and practical. The recommendation to cut back on course work is one of them. And we support making vocational education more rigorous and part of mainstream education. </p> <p>But what is vital, above all, is to restore trust and faith in our exam systems. </p> <p>Just like a currency, the value of exams can erode over time - and if this carries on for too long uncorrected, a clear revaluation becomes necessary. That time has come. So today, I am setting out our plans to achieve that. </p> <p>First, the A-level. A-levels remain the best means of testing students' academic knowledge and potential. A-levels should not therefore be abolished. Any new diploma must express clearly on the front the subjects and grades achieved at A-level. In addition we will introduce a new top grade for A-level which clearly identifies those who have achieved the best academic results. We also propose other changes which will reinforce the status and credibility of the A-level to ensure that it is recognised as the gold standard of the exam system that we wish it to be.</p> <p>For many years, the exam boards used to award roughly the same proportions of grades each year. Then, in the 1980s, the Conservatives allowed exam boards to use what was called criterion referencing. This defined the required standard in respect of, for example, an A grade. This objective was so that all those pupils who achieved that standard were awarded an A grade. </p> <p>Over the years, it has become clear that it is nearly impossible to do this with any precision. As a result, the number of students receiving an A grade has grown strongly and steadily in every successive year. It is no longer possible for either universities or employers to know that someone with the highest grade at A-level is automatically among the best and brightest of their year. In short, the present approach just doesn't work. So we will change it.</p> <p>Instead, we will ensure that the highest grade of A-level should only be awarded to a fixed proportion of students sitting that subject that year. </p> <p>This will clearly identify the students who have achieved the very best results of all those sitting the exam.</p> <p>Second we will ensure that the actual exam mark, as well as the grade, is published for each candidate.</p> <p>This will ensure that there is once again a fair way for universities and employers to distinguish between candidates who have similar grades.</p> <p>Third, A-levels need to be made more thorough and demanding. </p> <p>The AS-level will go, returning the A-level to a two-year course. We also think it wrong that students can retake parts of their A-levels time after time. So we will stop multiple resits of individual modules within A-levels. </p> <p>Fourth we will begin an immediate reform of the exam regulators and exam boards. </p> <p>We had originally planned that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which is supposed to safeguard exam standards, should be made independent of government. But in light of recent criticism and concern, we have decided that this would be the wrong approach. The QCA has become too ardent a defender of every aspect of the present system. That has undermined its position as a credible referee. To give it independence now, when it has lost people's faith, would be wrong. </p> <p>Instead, as a first step, we would overhaul the QCA entirely, so that the exam system is policed by people who are committed to maintain standards. In particular, those in charge must never again be defenders of the view that less than half the marks could be sufficient for an A grade at A-level. </p> <p>We also propose some other changes. We will remove the DfES rules which prevent schools offering alternative, internationally-recognised exams such as the International Baccalaureate or the O-level. It is clearly absurd that O-levels continue to be written in the UK for students abroad, but cannot be taken by state school pupils in the UK. </p> <p>And we will scrap targets. </p> <p>We cannot and will not support the target for 50% of all young people to go to university. Neither the employers' organisations, nor many academics, regard the 50% target as necessary. </p> <p>We will also scrap targets for the numbers of young people receiving particular grades at 16 or 18. The priority should be for ministers to give teachers and schools the backing they need to raise standards for all - not for Whitehall to have any incentives, real or apparent, to try to manipulate exam results. </p> <p>We must also raise performance in literacy and numeracy. Employers are rightly furious when they find that the taxes they pay to finance full-time education produce so many school-leavers who cannot read, write or add up. </p> <p>The top priority for primary and secondary schools must be to teach all children to read, write and add up properly. That's the best way to give youngsters a good start in life. Under our Right to Choose policy, remedial action will be taken against schools that fail. Governors could be required to appoint a new head teacher or the failing school could be taken over by a successful school.</p> <p>Finally, the Tomlinson report believes that we should move away from external assessment at 16. </p> <p>We do not. </p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce and others have made it clear that they cannot expect their members to treat an internally assessed qualification as adequate. I agree with them. </p> <p>Nor could school league tables possibly be fair if schools had such an incentive to manipulate results. Of course, the vast majority would do no such thing. But it would only take a very few to be caught doing it for the whole process to be discredited. So we propose instead a more robust, more vigorous, more independent regime of external assessment - with incentives throughout for accurate, rather than convenient, results.</p> <p>We do not favour the abolition of GCSEs. Instead reform should seek to make them more rigorous and more credible. External assessment is an essential prerequisite for that. </p> <p>These are practical proposals that the next Conservative government will implement in its first term. </p> <p>We will revalue our examinations to restore faith in them. Assessment will be less frequent, more independent, tougher and more credible. </p> <p>The trouble with the current approach - where all should have prizes and more and more people should go to university - is that the genuinely talented and ambitious, from whatever background, lose out and are held back.</p> <p>This approach is not simply wrong; it will also undermine Britain's long-term competitiveness. I want Britain to be blazing the trail, not lagging behind. I am ambitious for our country. An educated workforce is the key to success in today's highly competitive, global markets. Editors, more than most, know this to be true.</p> <p>Conservatives believe that every child deserves the chance to be stretched, challenged, and uplifted by the exams system.</p> <p>Admission to university must depend on a proven academic merit, best demonstrated by a fair and robust exams system. It should not be determined by social engineering.</p> <p>That is why so many universities are now expressing resentment at the government's interference with their freedom to decide on admissions.</p> <p>Last week, ministers appointed the first state university access regulator - who promptly announced that he is \"old Labour\" in his views and of the opinion that the principal problem facing higher education is what he called \"class\". Very few universities, employers or even students, would agree.</p> <p>That is why one of our immediate commitments under our Timetable for Action is to abolish the post of university access regulator as soon as we come to office.</p> <p>For every student and every employer needs to be able to have confidence that certificates, diplomas and access to higher education genuinely reflect merit and ability.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will make sure that this is so.\"</p>",
  "A nuclear fuel plant that has so far cost the taxpayer more than \u00a3600m without generating any income may be shut down. <p>An inquiry by Sir John Bourn, the head of parliament's watchdog, the National Audit Office, following a Guardian investigation, has revealed that the option of closure is being discussed within the government. It could mean that the factory at Sellafield in Cumbria, known as the mox plant because it makes new nuclear fuel from mixed oxides of plutonium and uranium, is shut down before it completes its first contract. But Sir John also found that closure would cost a significant extra amount of public money.</p> <p>In July the Guardian revealed that Tony Blair had overruled warnings from ministers that the factory would be a financial disaster when he ordered the plant to start production. Serious technical problems have meant that the plant, now eight years behind schedule, has not yet produced a single saleable item.</p> <p>Sir John reveals that costs have shot up by \u00a3225m, piling up the debts of the already technically bankrupt, state-owned British Nuclear Fuels.</p> <p>The inquiry was launched at the instigation of Michael Meacher, the former environment minister. While in the government, Mr Meacher had advised against opening the plant, but was overruled by Mr Blair.</p> <p>Mr Meacher said yesterday: \"It is astonishing that the government is in the position of considering closing the plant before it has produced anything. The situation is far worse than I thought.\"</p> <p>In a report, Sir John says that \"any decision on the future of the [plant] will involve a choice between continuing to operate and closure\". He adds that \"a decision to close immediately would incur large costs, including contractual penalty payments to customers\".</p> <p>BNFL has claimed that it could win enough orders to make the plant financially viable, but has only been able to land two contracts.</p> <p>Sir John reports that BNFL continues to claim that it will be able to secure enough contracts to keep the plant going: \"Furthermore, their assessment indicates that it would be much more expensive to close the plant immediately than to continue operating.\"</p> <p>The plant is intended to reuse plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel rods from overseas power stations, to produce new fuel for these stations. The DTI said it was assessing the improvement programme for the mox plant and deciding whether the technical problems could be overcome.</p> <p>Sir John's report says it is \"likely\" that the government will review the future of the plant when it takes over direct responsibility for it in April.</p> <p>At that point, BNFL's rising debts could embarrass the Treasury, which has anticipated a large income from the mox plant to fund Britain's nuclear clean-up. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which will come into existence in April to take charge of the clean-up of Britain's nuclear waste mountain, has been told by the Treasury that half its annual \u00a32bn costs should come from income from Sellafield's mox plant and associated reprocessing works.</p>",
  "<p>Britain could face a winter of power blackouts and price rises because of a \"looming crisis\" in the industry, one of the country's biggest trade unions claimed today. </p> <p>Amicus, whose members come from the manufacturing and technology sectors, warned the government there was a \"real possibility\" of blackouts in large parts of the country because of serious problems with generating capacity. </p> <p>A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman accused the union of \"scaremongering\" and said there was a good outlook for electricity supplies in the UK this winter. </p> <p>But Amicus's general secretary, Derek Simpson, warned: \"Dire consequences could follow if the action Amicus is demanding is not taken. </p> <p>\"We could be suffering routine blackouts in the next few years and the sort of energy price hikes we have seen in recent weeks because of the increasing reliance on foreign supplies from unstable countries.\" </p> <p>Leaders from Amicus and the National Union of Mineworkers plan to meet the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to press home their fears of blackouts. </p> <p>The unions have called for a wide-ranging review of future energy requirements and fresh investment in clean, coal-fired power stations.</p> <p>Amicus said there would be colder winters because of global warming. New European directives aimed at curbing carbon emissions would compound the problem, as would closures of magnox nuclear power stations, the union added. </p> <p>Mr Simpson said the government should encourage coal fire-generating plant owners to equip their power stations in order to reduce carbon emissions and comply with new EU directives.</p> <p>He said: \"A programme of publicly funded research and development for clean coal technology must be undertaken as part of a long-term energy policy for the UK. </p> <p>\"This has to be backed up by investment in the UK's power, engineering and manufacturing sector to develop expertise in the design and construction of new power stations.\" </p> <p>Stephen Tindale, director of Greenpeace, said: \"Supporters of nuclear power like Amicus regularly claim the lights could go out at any moment, but their real fear is that government support for nuclear power might be switched off. </p> <p>\"With huge investment in energy efficiency and the growing renewable energy industry, we can have clean electricity, security of supply and thousands more jobs. If every new building was as energy efficient as the gherkin in London, we would not need any new power stations.\" </p> <p>Digby Jones, the director of the CBI, said rising power costs were having a \"huge impact\" on manufacturing. He said oil costs had risen by 75% in 18 months, with electricity costing \u00a35bn more and the cost of manufacturing metal up 55%.</p> <p>There was very little risk that this would cause a recession, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, he warned: \"What it will mean is a cut in the profits of manufacturing. That means less jobs, less tax and fewer schools and hospitals.\"</p>",
  "Ballot papers were sent out today to the north-east's nearly two million voters asking them if they want a new regional assembly, in the first test of strength for the government's plans for English devolution. <p>The all-postal referendum will probably be decided within the next few days, as pollsters expect voters to return their slips within the first week - although the result will not be announced until the deadline of November 4.</p> <p>But with little over a fortnight to go, the no campaign has a clear seven-point lead, according to a Mori survey of over 1,000 voters. That gap widens to 23 points among those certain to vote on November 4, according to the study in the Northern Echo newspaper. </p> <p>The voting paper poses the question: \"Should there be an elected assembly for the north-east region?\" </p> <p>The result is expected to be close and turnout predicted to be low.</p> <p>A yes vote will be seen as vindication for deputy prime minister, John Prescott, for whom devolution to the regions is a pet project. Meanwhile a no vote would be a blow to the government's delayed plans for similar referendums in Yorkshire and the north-west - as well as a significant gauge of the government's ability to win voters over ahead of a likely national referendum on the EU constitution in 2006.</p> <p>Today the head of the largest regional chamber of commerce in the region expressed scepticism at the planned assembly, which will cost \u00a325m a year to run.</p> <p>George Cowcher, chief executive of the 5,000 strong North East Chamber of Commerce, told the Financial Times: \"I think the more people get to know about it, the more worried members are, but there's still huge ignorance.</p> <p>\"Business would be very interested in real devolution, and real decision-making in the region. At the moment the powers are too weak; people have said to me that the north-east deserves better.\"</p> <p>If the regional assembly is set up, the current two-tier local government in Northumberland and County Durham would have to be rearranged into a single tier and voters will be asked how this should be done. </p> <p>The referendum election campaign began in July with the official yes and no campaigns announced in mid-September. </p> <p>The yes campaign has the backing of former Newcastle United chairman, Sir John Hall, and Ray Mallon, the independent mayor of Middlesbrough, whilst the no campaign has a variety of business backers.</p> <p>The Tories and the UK Independence party both back a no vote, while the Lib Dems are campaigning for an assembly - albeit with reservations about the body's lack of powers.</p> <p>Although the assembly is modelled on the Greater London assembly, which has powers over planning, housing, emergency services and the environment, its exact responsibilities have yet to be spelled out, exacerbating the problems of the referendum campaign.</p> <p>Both the official yes and no campaigns received \u00a3100,000 from the Electoral Commission. If the voters take up the offer of an assembly, it would comprise 25 members, probably elected by some form of proportional representation. </p> <p>The body would be able to levy a precept on council taxpayers to raise revenue.</p>",
  "<p>Government strategies forcing higher growth and hundreds of thousands of new houses on an already prosperous south-east of England are challenged today by a thinktank which is close to Tony Blair. </p> <p>Questioning the region's ability to handle further expansion, it warns that the south should instead concentrate on coping with current pressures, including congestion, pollution, disparities within the region and the lack of affordable housing. </p> <p>In a report certain to raise more doubts about John Prescott's plan for four big growth areas in the south and east of England, the Institute for Public Policy Research bluntly says that the case for ever-faster economic expansion is wrong. </p> <p>It seeks to demolish the argument of government agencies pushing for further growth to match continental counterparts, using figures showing that the south already compares well with mainland Europe's most prosperous regions. </p> <p>The region is already on a par with all the \"well-known centres of commerce outside London and Paris\": Milan, Turin, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich, and Stuttgart, for instance. </p> <p>The report labels two other arguments as myths: that the south has an overheating labour market, characterised by skills shortages, and that its future lies in the \"knowledge economy\". </p> <p>It argues that problems caused by skills shortages and gaps do not appear to be a bigger problem in the south than elsewhere, while the region's ability to draw graduates from the rest of the UK and overseas might give it an advantage. </p> <p>Pushing for a \"knowledge economy\" is labelled an ill-defined concept and a throwback to an industrial policy of \"picking winners\" which had little success in the second half of the 20th century. </p> <p>Research commissioned by public agencies in the south defines such an economy to include only a \"handful of high-technology manufacturing and service activities\". That definition excludes business and financial services - \"the obvious area of comparative advantage for the greater south-east\". </p> <p>Prepared for an IPPR-led commission on sustainable development in the south-east, whose membership includes some of the major players in the region, the report will be seized on by critics of the expansion plans. </p> <p>Those opponents range from amenity groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England to northern MPs and some councils in the south fearful of the impact growth will have on the countryside. </p> <p>In one critical section, the report notes: \"Further increasing the rate of economic growth in the south-east does not seem a high priority relative to dealing with disparities in prosperity within the region and coping with the problems that current levels of relative economic success pose - particularly in terms of traffic congestion, the lack of affordable housing, the use of natural resources and the quality of the environment.\" </p> <p>But it cautions that such a critique should not be confused with arguing for no growth, or lower growth. It says it is merely suggesting that the current rate of growth is acceptable as an economic objective, although it \"will pose challenges for achieving environmental objectives in the region\". </p> <p>The report comes amid signs of a policy re-appraisal by Gordon Brown and Mr Prescott, who are charged with pushing through the southern growth areas, principally the 40-mile Thames Gateway corridor running from east London to Essex and Kent. </p> <p>In a speech in Newcastle upon Tyne last week the chancellor, accompanied by the deputy prime minister, said that a key theme in Labour's next manifesto would be how to make all regions more productive, prosperous and wealthy. </p> <p>But he warned that balanced economic growth becomes impossible \"if we have unemployment and emigration and the under-use of resources in one part of the country, and congestion and overcrowding and huge inflationary pressures in the other\". </p> <p>Jobless rates in the north-east, where unemployment is rising, contrary to the national trend, were twice those of the south-east, he noted, while business start-ups were only half the national average. </p> <p>Both Mr Brown and Mr Prescott are pushing a new initiative, known as the Northern Way, which is based on improving the economies of big cities such as Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield as well as surrounding growth areas to challenge the south. </p> <p>But the Brown-Prescott initiative sits uneasily alongside a public service agreement (PSA) between the government and its nine regional development agencies, updated this year. It is aimed at making improvements in the economic performance of all regions while reducing the prosperity gap between the strongest and the weakest - which is currently widening, according to the IPPR. </p> <p>Of the PSA target, the report notes: \"It means there is an objective for the south-east's rate of growth ... to be increased with all the other English regions.\"</p>",

  "<p>Shark Tale held on to the US box office top spot for a third weekend, comfortably seeing off competition from Team America, the latest effort from the creators of South Park. </p> <p>The animated comedy, set at the bottom of the sea, has so far netted $22.1m (\u00a312.2m) this week. With the family audience almost entirely to itself, Shark Tale has earned $118.8 million (\u00a365.4m) since its US release on October 1. </p> <p>The American football movie Friday Night Lights came in at No 2 for a second weekend, with $13.1m (\u00a37.2m), leaving the puppet parody Team America: World Police, in third place with $12.3m (\u00a36.8m) over its debut weekend.</p> <p>At No 4 was Shall We Dance? starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon, with $11.6 (\u00a36.4) million.</p> <p>It was a so-so debut for Team America, from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who have crafted a foul-mouthed, bloody action comedy using puppets to satirise everything from US global military muscle to Hollywood political activism.</p> <p>The movie caused a stir last week when a puppet sex scene nearly resulted in the film receiving an NC-17 rating, which would have meant no one under 17 could see it. The sex scene was toned down so the movie could win an R rating, which means under-17s can view the film provided they are accompanied by an adult.</p> <p>Critics generally praised Team America for its irreverent humour, but the film came in at the low end of distributor Paramount's box-office expectations of a $12m to $15m debut.</p> <p>Wayne Lewellen, Paramount's head of distribution, told the AP news agency: \"The heat on the picture seemed to be building as we got closer to opening, but the weekend wasn't that disappointing.\" </p> <p>Both Team America and Shall We Dance? are expected to fare well over the next few weeks.

  "<p>Businesses in the UK lost more than \u00a340bn last year - equivalent to about \u00a3100m a day - because of economic crime, a report said today.</p> <p>The study, by accountants and advisers RSM Robson Rhodes, identified embezzlement, cheque fraud and money laundering as the main areas of concern, as well as employee-related crimes such as bribery and corruption. </p> <p>Most companies believed economic crime affected their share price and brand image, the report added. </p> <p>It revealed that businesses had lost \u00a332bn last year because of economic or corporate crime and spent \u00a38bn trying to combat the problem. </p> <p>Bill Cleghorn, a partner at RSM, said: \"The \u00a340bn cost to businesses is staggering and could be just the tip of the iceberg.\" </p> <p>RSM said the Enron scandal had highlighted the impact of economic crime, with the collapse of the US energy group following \"dubious accounting practices\" helping to drive a global stock market slump. </p> <p>A hundred companies with a combined market value of \u00a3500bn were polled in the survey. They agreed that, in the light of Enron and similar instances, economic crime was now a board-level issue. </p> <p>One in three admitted to discussing the issue once a year or less, indicating executives are not doing enough to tackle the \"business killer\". </p> <p>Mr Cleghorn said: \"Businesses need to take the risks posed more seriously.

  "<p>It's not really a gherkin. It's a pine cone, or perhaps a poplar. Anyway, Norman Foster and Partners' Swiss Re building is, as well as defiantly modern, resonantly classical. All that nonsense with Prince Charles and neo-Georgian conservatism, which has been getting away with opposing the classical to the modern, distracts from the formal beauty of the skyscraper that, rightly, won the RIBA Stirling prize on Saturday night. </p> <p>I don't know what the Prince thinks of 30 St Mary Axe, as it prefers to be known. Perhaps he sees in it the ominous shape of a vertical zeppelin, menacing St Paul's. It has everything that used to be scorned by the British public: radical shape, industrial materials, imposing itself on a City skyline that some argue should be reserved for Wren and Hawksmoor. Laughed at when it was announced, instantly popular when (quickly) built, this is the first great skyscraper to be built in London. </p> <p>It instantly exposes the banal ugliness of the NatWest tower or Canary Wharf. Because it has no British rivals, you have to go to New York to see how original Foster's tower is. It is comparable with the Chrysler building, the glorious art deco skyscraper built in Manhattan in the 1920s. But it has one over the Chrysler. Stripped of its glittering chrome crown, the New York City landmark would be straight-lined, regular, even ordinary. The gherkin, cone or conifer that expands as it rises, before narrowing again to a dome, does not have a single orthodox aspect. Its entire body curves at every point. It glitters and reflects all over, creating optical patterns that change with distance, and with the times of day. It is a masterpiece that opens new possibilities for world architecture. And it's in London, a city whose architectural history can best be described as sad. But then, architectural masterpieces are appearing all over the world nowadays. </p> <p>The revolution began in Bilbao, when Frank Gehry's glistening, titanium-skinned mountain range of a Guggenheim Museum not only competed successfully with Frank Lloyd Wright's original Guggenheim in New York City but redefined what architects are capable of doing. The combination of digital design and new building materials enables architects to create shapes that were never possible before. Gehry's multifaceted, warped spaces finally achieve what architects dreamt of doing a century ago - translating cubist painting into real space. Daniel Libeskind does the same thing for expressionism: in early 20th-century German paintings by Ludwig Kirchner rapidly moving, jagged shards splinter the world in a way that communicates anxiety. Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin is the architectural equivalent. </p> <p>Cubism, expressionism, futurism, surrealism - in trying to describe the proliferating originalities of contemporary architecture, you find yourself reaching for analogies with the great art movements of the last century. And that is why I am interested. </p> <p>Delightful from a distance, 30 St Mary Axe is even richer as you approach past an ancient London church and see that wonderful inflation shimmying out of the earth. The triangular panels create a complex of colour and shade. At the bottom of the skyscraper, stone benches carved with classical epitaphs remind us that this, as much as the World Trade Centre site for which Foster failed to get the commission, is a place of memorial and pain, devastated by an IRA bomb. Cypresses, whose elongated curves are echoed here, were planted around tombs in the classical world. </p> <p>Everyone talks about the \"gherkin\" as if it were weird and unprecedented, but it is not. Where other recent architecture has a lot in common with the extravagance of the baroque, Foster and his team have created a form that is manifestly in the classical tradition. The Swiss Re building is not irregular - it is regular; its expansiveness culminates in a dome that rhymes with that of St Paul's. Far from being a stranger on the London skyline, this is a shape that Wren, or Michelangelo, or any of the architects of the European great tradition would have recognised, admired and envied. </p> <p>The building is surrounded, on a weekday lunchtime, with admirers. Architecture fans from all over the world are here, taking photographs, begging the security guards to let them in to the lobby. I'm here for a different reason. Art, rather than architecture, concerns me. And this is the most satisfying new work of art I've seen in years. </p> <p>It is modern and ancient; it is site-specific; it sculpts the sky. It is a monument and a mirror. It makes you see London in a new way. It does things that artists - people who are officially called that - have given up even trying to do. </p> <p>The new architecture that announced itself to the world with Gehry's Guggenheim does not bear simply a superficial resemblance to the art of Picasso, or Kirchner, or Michelangelo. It really is doing things we once expected sculpture to do. It has obliterated the difference between architecture and art. More than that, it is filling the space contemporary art has abandoned. Walk from Foster's Bishopsgate masterpiece and over the formerly wobbly footbridge to Tate Modern, and you can contrast architecture's current creativity with contemporary art's refusal of the same. </p> <p>Art has never, in history, been more talked about, venerated, and valued than it is now. The opening of Bruce Nauman's installation in the museum's Turbine Hall is a national event. But Nauman has left the hall physically almost empty, except for the speakers that relay his sound piece, a collection of statements sampled from his previous works. </p> <p>Nauman, it says on a white placard against the grey wall, is one of the most revered artists in the world. And so he is, which makes the contrast between his art and that of Norman Foster all the more telling. </p> <p>The respect that accrues to Nauman comes from his restraint, his refusal to add to the world. He is a pithy commentator, a Beckettian joker. But he is not someone who creates form. That old job of the artist is rejected by the art world that lauds Nauman. Don't get me wrong, and think I mean to equate Bruce Nauman with \"modern art\". Modernism never rejected imagination, poetry, or images in the way that this chewing wail of a work in the Turbine Hall does. It's not just that art now does not add new forms to the world, it is specifically praised and valued for not doing so. Which means that the only real sculpture of our time is being made by architects. </p> <p>Architecture is art's last, best hope. Architects are escaping all the cliches by which art is entangled. In art, there is a perpetual, facile argument between ancients and moderns, conservatives and champions of the new. You have to either like Bruce Nauman or Raphael. There isn't really a cultural space that can contain the two: past and present are no longer on speaking terms. In the arcane discourse that museums of modern art have lost themselves in, both Raphael and Picasso are considered old hat. Show me someone who can see Picasso as a lame old conservative and I'll show you mental collapse. But that is the insidious message you are fed by the contemporary Kunsthalle. </p> <p>This is the self-delusion of a bronze age. A hundred years ago, western art experienced its second renaissance. The two greatest periods in the history of art are 1430-1540 and 1860-1920. The creativity of modernism at the beginning of the 20th century will always stretch minds: cubist paintings will never be easy. </p> <p>Art now deflects comparison with Picasso, Matisse, Kandinsky, Malevich. What can you do? Critics and curators shy away from the history of modern art into a narcissistic relativism. According to this easy argument, Bruce Nauman challenges us, now, in a comparable way to how Picasso challenged people in 1907 when he painted Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. </p> <p>It's nonsense. Picasso, for one thing, still looks hideous to many visitors to Tate Modern - that is, he's still new. Cubism has not been assimilated. And with Nauman, there's almost nothing to assimilate. It's all content - all ideas, expressed in words. Once you get the depressing message, you can move on. </p> <p>Modernist art - all great art - threatens and delights formally, visually, spatially. This formal creativity is what artists have run away from into art whose melodramatic \"content\" will in future mean nothing to anyone. It will look as boringly prosaic as moralising Victorian paintings do to us. For art to triumph as art it must have the flame of formal abandon that is in Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, or Matisse's Dance - or Norman Foster's erotic gherkin. </p> <p>Why is architecture so much less hyped than art? The fact is that artists are more glamorous than architects. Building is a business, and even younger architects find it hard to accept that Foster, a business genius, is also an aesthetic one. Carping about him is rife in professional journals. It's easier to see how Daniel Libeskind is an artist. But even he has a global studio. </p> <p>Art in 2004 revels in the lo-fi, the amateurish, the readymade. You can be an \"artist\", in the almost religious way Tracey Emin talks of being an \"artist\", with nothing but a pencil and paper or, yes, some dirty bedding; or, as in Nauman's case, a sound system. It gives us all hope. Architects are far more arrogant, capitalist types. Architects don't appeal to the romantic myth of the artist. </p> <p>There was an interesting episode when Norman Foster and his team were designing the footbridge connecting St Paul's cathedral and Tate Modern. It was reported that Foster wanted a sculpture by Anthony Caro to stand at the Tate side of the bridge. Tate director Nicholas Serota said no. Caro is one of the last modernists, his sculpture Early One Morning a three-dimensional abstract painting. He wouldn't sit well with Tate Modern, that's true. It seems the modernist tradition - which is also the Renaissance tradition - of optical form is not dead. It has moved across the river, and into the sky.</p>",
  "Last winter, I embarked on an ambitious musical project in Antarctica, having been awarded a joint fellowship from the Arts Council and the British Antarctic Survey's artists and writers programme. <p>What ensued was, for me, the journey of a lifetime - a profound physical, artistic and emotional experience that had a deeper effect on my life than I could ever have imagined. </p> <p>I journeyed to far and desolate lands, recorded colonies of penguins and seals, flew to isolated huts deep in the Antarctic peninsula, and smashed through pack ice aboard an ice strengthened ship. </p> <p>I experienced the euphoric highs and mind-crushing lows of solitude, and the overwhelming presence of all who had come and gone, together with the realisation that I was, as a human and an artist, a mere speck on this planet.</p> <p>The main artistic product of my three-month journey was Antarctica, an impressionistic, large-scale electro-acoustic composition, created from an original sound library compiled during my residency and comprising field recordings of the many audible aspects of human life, animal life and the environment in Antarctica. </p> <p>Selected items were layered, stacked, collaged and combined to form a rich and complex theatre of sound. Antarctica, which is realised in cinema surround sound, enables the audience to be absorbed into a three-dimensional soundscape portraying both my own responsive emotions and experiences and those of the communities in Antarctica.</p> <p>The focus of my many field recordings was to capture and reflect the relationship between the British Antarctic Survey and the continent it embraces, as well as the life and populations of the area surrounding the Weddell Sea. </p> <p>Under these headings, natural sounds (wind, sea, weather and wildlife), human sounds (scientists living and working, boat captains, whalers, interviews and conversation), mechanical sounds (machinery, generators, boats, scientific experiments, travel and television), and phenomenological sounds (whistling rigging, clanking objects, crunching ice floes, musical accidents) were of equal significance. </p> <p>As a composer and musician, I have always been fascinated by the musical possibilities of \"found sound\", considering it to be capable of making musical gestures and being used as part of a larger piece. I award these samples the same regard and respect as certain other composers do melodic lines, using the same six essential parameters that govern music - pitch, duration, dynamic, tone, texture and form. </p> <p>During my research in Antarctica, through the musical exploration of auditioning and editing sounds, I found that each day's recordings were miniature compositions in themselves, containing complex musical elements, organisation and development. </p> <p>Within the final piece, I extend these musical considerations to the quartet of voices I used: Chris, an Antarctic mariner since the 60s and the master of the royal research ship James Clark Ross; Rick, an experienced Antarctic/Arctic dog handler, returning after his first visit in the 70s; Andy, an engineer, returning to Antarctica after first going there in the 80s, and Sarah, a zoologist embarking on a two and a half year stay. </p> <p>I layered their words and memories of Antarctica (resonating with my own) on top of each other to create counterpoint and polyphony. The listener can then choose to hear the narrative proffered by the language, or the music of its phonetic rhythms and sounds.</p> <p>The three-month residency was a unique privilege - not only was I able to experience the continent and be one of only few to have set foot there, but I was also able to spend the time completely immersed and focused on creating, thinking and writing about my music. </p> <p>Rereading my diaries for Guardian Unlimited, or performing one of the pieces from Antarctica, I am instantly transported back to a place of utter focus, creativity and security - strange how the most hostile place on the planet could become a haven and creative womb for this weirdo. </p> <p>There was not a minute or second wasted while I was down south, yet being hurled back into a hectic London schedule of meetings, meetings, travel and meetings means there is not a second or minute allowing complete immersion or focus on anything.</p> <p>There is also not a second or minute not spent wishing I was back in Antarctica with my penguins, my music and my focus.</p>",

  "<p>A row between employers and unions over business demands for longer working hours and delayed retirement has held up a report for European leaders on how to revitalise the so-called Lisbon strategy for making the EU the world's \"most dynamic and competitive economy\" by 2010. </p> <p>A 13-strong group chaired by Wim Kok, the former Dutch premier, is due to present its findings to EU leaders at their Brussels summit early next month. It will warn them that, in the near-five years since the strategy was adopted, Europe has fallen further behind the US and Asia. </p> <p>Amid union fears that the incoming European commission is firmly wedded to the Anglo-Saxon model of liberalisation and flexibility, and is ready to abandon key elements of the continental social model, the Kok group is understood to have been riven by employer demands for a longer working life to kickstart the faltering EU economy. </p> <p>The report, due to be completed late last week, says that the EU will fail to meet its target of raising the overall employment rate for men to 70% and of women to 60% by 2010 because it is growing at 2% at the very most, compared with the goal of 3% - still far behind US and Asian growth rates. </p> <p>A draft version says: \"If Europe cannot adapt its ageing working population will be unable to sustain the cost of maintaining pensions to Europe's growing army of pensioners, economic growth will stagnate and institutions will be faced with contraction and decline.\" </p> <p>Employers on the group, including Niall FitzGerald, former Unilever chairman who now holds the same position at Reuters, are said by insiders to want greater flexibility built into working hours, with clear hints that the 35-hour week enjoyed in France and Germany should be abandoned. German companies, including Bosch, Mercedes, Siemens and Volkswagen, are enforcing longer hours in return for job guarantees. </p> <p>But John Monks, leader of the European TUC, which has three members on the Kok group, said: \"Our approach is not to look west [to the US] or east [Asia] but to look north, to the Nordic countries such as Finland, Sweden and Denmark which figured at the top of the league table in last week's Davos rankings on global competitiveness.\" </p> <p>He said the Scandinavian economies were already meeting the Lisbon targets, with low unemployment combined with high union density and collective bargaining across a range of issues - including retirement and pensions. \"Finland has flexible retirement schemes which are a matter of choice and help meet the problem of an ageing population as well as high state support for economic change.\" </p> <p>The Kok report is expected to argue that the EU should drop many of its myriad targets, getting governments to draw up national plans for raising growth rates, including better job creation. It demands corporate tax harmonisation, including in low wage, low tax eastern Europe - a key French demand fiercely resisted by the liberal British and Dutch.</p>",
  "<p>With some 14m packets sold every day, they seem to be in every supermarket, corner shop, kitchen cupboard and lunchbox. Thanks to those 51 advertisements featuring Gary Lineker, Walkers crisps are Britain's number one grocery brand.</p> <p>All the more astonishing then that just about the only place you won't find the cheerful foil packets this week is in Walkers' new \u00a33m advertising campaign. What is going on? An advert without the product is regarded as as great a marketing sin as an advert showing a rival brand.</p> <p>What is going on is that people are getting fatter, everyone is worried about the rising levels of obesity and some major food manufacturers are changing their advertising and marketing. Last week McDonald's dropped its famous golden arches from its adverts, replacing them with a golden question mark to get the public to look at the company in a new light. And now Walkers has an advertising campaign that does not show a single crisp. Instead, the 30-second advert, which appears on Wednesday, shows Lineker, a bunch of kids and some of the 2m devices Walkers will give away free as its contribution to the fight against obesity - the Walkers' pedometer, or walk-o-meter.</p> <p>Walkers. Get Britain Walking. It is a simple idea and simplicity, says the man who is responsible for the scheme and will carry the can if it fails, is the essence of effective marketing. \"It's enlightened self-interest, no more than that,\" says Martin Glenn, president of Walkers' parent company, PepsiCo UK &amp; Ireland, and the man who as marketing vice-president of Walkers in the 1990s brought the Lineker phenomenon to an unsuspecting public. \"We think the Walkers brand will grow on the back of it, just as it did with free books for schools.\"</p> <p>Glenn, 44, is regarded as the most powerful marketer in the country by some, as he has Pepsi, Tropicana, Quaker oats and Walkers under his wing. And with the government pondering a TV junk food advertising ban and a \"traffic light\" food labelling scheme to deal with it, the pedometer giveaway is all about what he terms \"brand regard\".</p> <p>\"These will hang around,\" says Glenn, rummaging in his leather satchel and producing a red walk-ometer. \"These are nicely branded, unashamedly branded.\" About the size of a microcassette, the gadget has the cheery red-and-yellow Walkers roundel in the corner. Curiously it already has 146 steps registered on it.</p> <p>\"You can cheat by shaking it,\" says Glenn, who reveals that his three young daughters first pointed that out. PepsiCo has budgeted to give away 2m, but the offer is already on 10% of packs and Walkers has sent out 60,000, so it might need more. \"We can get enough of these things, it's just that we will have a slight budget problem,\" says Glenn. </p> <p>Walkers says it can fight the rising levels of obesity because it's a very effective mass marketer. \"We are good at popularising things that are seen to be somewhat elite and middle class if you like. We are a tabloid, we are not a broadsheet but we do that well,\" Glenn says. Like the free books for schools scheme, the company thinks the giveaway will make people feel good about it. </p> <p>In three weeks, the Sun and Asda will join the scheme, offering a newspaper coupon that readers can redeem at the supermarket for a walk-o-meter. But before that the advert will appear. To the upbeat strains of One Step Beyond, by ska band Madness, happy kids walk in giant conga lines across parks and down streets. They click their fingers and pedometers tumble into their hands. But, loveable duffer that he is, Lineker's finger clicking is ineffective, until a young walker helps him out, and pedometers rain down on him. Importantly, there is no link to purchase. Glenn watched as a Cadbury Schweppes coupon scheme to give away free sports equipment to schools backfired when the company was attacked for linking chocolate and sports kit.</p> <p>Regarded as determined and ambitious, Glenn has restructured PepsiCo and drawn Pepsi, Walkers, Quaker and Tropicana under a single management team, but in many ways the obesity threat is his greatest challenge. Last year he attended the Commons select committee hearings with executives from Cadbury Schweppes and McDonald's. He did not enjoy the experience, which he said was not a grilling, more a \"light toasting\". It opened his eyes to political agendas in the debate. </p> <p>Last month PepsiCo signed a major deal with Freud Communications, the PR agency run by Matthew Freud, husband of Elisabeth Murdoch and famous for celebrity clients such as Geri Halliwell. The company handles all PepsiCo's corporate PR as well as publicity for its brands, which brings in fees of more than \u00a31m. Glenn says the government is \"floundering\" in the communications campaign needed to fight obesity. \"What the government could do, and I think it is a government thing, is agree what is the core message and I think they are floundering a bit. It's simple. You get fat because you take in more calories than you expend.\" Glenn dismisses reports that the government will move to ban junk food advertising on TV before 9pm. \"Hearing the senior members of government ... I think they are serious and also practical. I would be really surprised if there were blanket bans. They know that it won't do much to affect the problem.\"</p> <p>Glenn is frank. \"Companies seemed to be falling over backwards telling the world that they don't actually advertise to kids. Coke are on record saying that. It's a bit of a weasel.\" He says only 10% of Walkers' ad spend is shown during children's TV, partly because kids watch TV all the time. \"If you want to buy the TV show with the biggest reach of kids, you buy Coronation Street.\"</p> <p>Glenn, who eats a bag of cheese and onion crisps every day, also attacks the government food-labelling option that would see a red, amber or green traffic light label on food, warning consumers about its health content. The traffic light system is \"a grand statement of the bleeding obvious\". People are perfectly aware that crisps and chocolate contain fat. Besides, cheese and avocados are considered healthy but the former is high in fat and salt and the latter is high in calories. \"We will fight it by showing how impractical it is,\" he says. \"Simple answers to complicated problems rarely work and I think the traffic light system is a great example of that.\"</p> <p>Last week the third-quarter earnings of McDonald's rose in America but European sales were still down. Glenn attributes the good news in the US to the fact that the changes made by the big food companies are working. \"It tells you the world is changing and that if you reinvent yourself you can do very well.\" But he is aware that in a rapidly changing world some things remain eternal.</p> <p>\"The truth of the matter is that people like the taste of fried potato. They have done for hundreds of years and they will do for the next hundred years.\"</p>",

  "The caravan of the European Social Forum moves on and London can reflect on having hosted a successful if sometimes internally fractious three days of intense debates, discussions, protests and cultural events, culminating in yesterday's peace march. The event was remarkable on several levels: it attracted to a wet city on the very edge of Europe nearly 25,000 mainly young people from more than 70 countries; it addressed legitimate issues and causes that are below the radar of mainstream political parties; and it brought under one metaphorical roof unions, a myriad of passionate non-government organisations, social movements, artists, academics and fringe political parties from all over Europe. Saturday night's storming of the stage by several hundred people denouncing mayor of London Ken Livingstone for hijacking the event reflected genuine anger about the way the event had been organised, but was marginal to the impact of the project. <p>Notable by their absence from this often chaotic salon de refus\u00e9s were all but a very few members of parliament and the entire British political elite. This lack of curiosity about what is energising young people at the European grassroots suggests that mainstream politicians are out of touch with both the spirit, content and the style of the inclusive non-party politics now emerging under the ESF umbrella. Any professional politician observing the audiences of 1,000 or more people raptly listening to debates on globalisation, the power of corporations, racism, food or the environment would do well to reflect on the narrowness of their own political agenda and the genuine transnationalism now clearly informing European youth. </p> <p>It is too early to say whether the ESF can refresh mainstream British politics and influence the European left. It is only three years old, is politically immature and each meeting tends to reflect the prevailing politics and tensions of the host country. It is possible that the event will disappear from the calendar and be remembered only as a European trade fair for political ideas. </p> <p>But it is equally possible that mayors of major European cities will now compete with each other to host the event as a kind of political Olympics. Clearly, the ESF's strength is its passion and diversity, which encourages participants to feel part of something greater than themselves. Out of the connections being made between radically different groups, it is possible to see in years to come the emergence of a genuine new politics of the European left.</p>",
  "<b> Michael Portillo </b> Sunday Times, October 17 <br> <p>\"'We are selling our souls for dross.' So wrote Craig Murray, ambassador to Uzbekistan, referring to the fact that Britain and the United States are accepting intelligence extracted from suspects under torture. Mr Murray is offended on moral grounds that the western democracies are in the market for information beaten out of prisoners. He also believes that we are being bamboozled, because terrified captives will say whatever their interrogators demand and then the nasty regime in Tashkent spices it up to make us believe that it is on the front line against al-Qaida. </p> <p>\"The reaction of the Foreign Office has been to defend the UK's practice, saying that it would be irresponsible to disregard leads obtained under duress, and to dismiss Mr Murray as ambassador. How has Britain come to stoop so low? One of the things that defined us as a nation was our abhorrence of brutality. How can it be then we also encourage foreign governments to mistreat prisoners?\" </p> <p><b> Financial Times </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"The Tashkent tyranny of President Islam Karimov is one of the worst in the world, with more than 5,000 political prisoners and capable of boiling men to death. Its value as a forward US base for Afghanistan operations has given it the confidence to sell a long-running campaign against internal dissidents as part of the campaign against al-Qaida. That is a confidence trick the west appears willing to fall for. </p> <p>\"The moral and legal case against torture should not need further argument. Unhappily, it needs to be continually restated in opposition not only to what goes on in such places as Uzbekistan, but in US-run facilities such as Guant\u00e1namo, Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Bagram in Afghanistan. As for the Foreign Office, if it sends a principled person to advance an unprincipled policy it is not only incompetent but riding for a fall - and deservedly so.\" </p> <p><b> Independent </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Over two years in Uzbekistan, Mr Murray had been outspoken about the abuse of human rights in that former Soviet republic. He might have got away with this hardly controversial view - indeed, he says he had cleared all his public speeches with the Foreign Office - had he not gone on to query the extent to which the US and Britain were turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in states such as Uzbekistan for the sake of the 'war on terror'. Implicating a third country, let alone a close ally, is a bigger offence than merely criticising your own. </p> <p>\"Earlier this year, the Foreign Office produced a new mission statement, which placed combating global terrorism and weapons of mass destruction at the top of its priorities, followed by protection from illegal immigration, drug trafficking and international crime. Human rights occupied the sixth of eight places. Craig Murray was working to the old agenda. Good for him.\" </p> <p><b> Times </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"As laudable as Mr Murray's motives were, his methods were self-indulgent. As ambassador he had unique access to [the Uzbek] regime via channels closed even to the most assiduous journalists, and his duty was to use them to advance Britain's interests, especially in security and trade, as well as those of Uzbekistan's oppressed dissidents and moderate Muslims. </p> <p>\"He described himself this week as a 'victim of conscience'. If so, the right time to salve his conscience, and the most effective time from the point of view of those he seeks to help, would have been at a post-resignation press conference. Mr Murray is guilty of naivety.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Express </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Craig Murray has accused MI6 of using information obtained by the Uzbek government through torture: the Foreign Office has responded by claiming Mr Murray arranged visas in exchange for sex with women. Mr Murray fiercely denies the claims. </p> <p>\"This is no way for Britain to be conducting her foreign affairs in public: both parties should pipe down. But what is most depressing is this: Mr Murray emerges as far more credible than the Foreign Office. What a sad decline in our country if we can even imagine that one of the great departments of state is capable of telling a lie.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Telegraph </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Compromises must be made during wars, of course. In the face of the Soviet menace, we propped up a number of brutal tyrants, telling ourselves, 'He may be a son-of-a-bitch, but he's our son-of-a-bitch.' In this case, though, it is far from clear that such an attitude serves western interests. The fact is that there is virtually no religious fundamentalism in Uzbekistan. The traveller to central Asia sees beards or headscarves rarely, and hears few calls to prayer. </p> <p>\"But President Karimov's claim that he is besieged by Muslim fanatics may eventually prove self- fulfilling. If they are offered no other outlet for their hatred of the regime, Uzbeks may indeed turn to fundamentalism. The quickest way to finish off the extremists in central Asia would be to encourage the development of property rights and political pluralism. What a pity that saying so should be a sacking offence.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is warned today that Britain's manufacturing recovery could be derailed by rising energy prices and consumers could face winter blackouts because of a short-fall in generating capacity. </p> <p>Tonight Digby Jones, director general of the CBI, will urge the government to avoid any moves which could push up energy prices and cause the recovery in the manufacturing sector to stall. </p> <p>Separately, Derek Simpson, general secretary of the trade union Amicus, is warning that power blackouts could become routine over the next few years because of what the union sees as \"serious problems blighting the UK's generating capacity\". </p> <p>In a speech to some 900 business leaders tonight, Mr Jones will point out that gas and electricity prices have risen by 40% over the past year, oil is up by more than 75%, while metal prices have risen by more than half. </p> <p>\"I am worried that rising costs will take the wind out of the sails of the manufacturing recovery. Earlier in the year - when global demand was stronger - companies were able to raise prices and pass on some costs, but this may be more difficult if demand weakens.\" </p> <p>The CBI is concerned that the manufacturing and power generation industries must be given a fair carbon allocation under the government's plans to meet its climate-change targets. It also wants interest rates to be left on hold and says the chancellor should not increase business's tax burden. </p> <p>\"The government should take note of the pressures that companies are facing. There are key decisions coming up on levels of carbon targets and business taxation. If ministers do anything to harm manufacturers now, they will be scoring a real own goal,\" says Mr Jones. </p> <p>For its part, Amicus is concerned that a combination of EU directives and the closure of some of Britain's older nuclear power plants will affect the country's ability to generate sufficient electricity. </p> <p>It believes that EC directives on carbon emissions trading will shorten the life expectancy of some of Britain's generating capacity which, \"together with the reduction in nuclear generating capacity due to the closure and decommissioning of the magnox nuclear power stations, [means] the UK's ability to generate its own dependable energy supply will be seriously reduced.\" </p> <p>The union wants a government review of future energy requirements and greater investment in clean coal-fired power stations which cut emissions of gases such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. </p> <p>\"Dire consequences could follow if the action Amicus is demanding is not taken. We could be suffering routine blackouts in the next few years and the sort of energy price hikes we have seen in recent weeks because of the increasing reliance on foreign supplies from unstable countries,\" Mr Simpson says. </p> <p>Ten power stations are scheduled to close over the next decade, while only two are under construction, according to Amicus. </p> <p>Yesterday the Department of Trade and Industry said security of supply was central to the government's energy policy and it was confident there was sufficient generating capacity for both the short and long term.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Thursday October 21 2004</strong></p> <p>In this report, we probably gave the impression that Marlon Brando rode a Harley Davidson in The Wild One. He did not. He rode a Triumph Bonneville. </p> <p><br></p> <p>Pull on your Brando jeans, slip your Brando leather jacket over your Brando white vest, adjust your Brando leather cap to a jaunty angle and ride off into the sunset on your Brando Harley. You're an instant rebel. </p> <p>But not for long. If the estate of the late Marlon Brando has its way, you will only be able to rebel with its permission. </p> <p>Alarmed that the actor's name and image may be used for commercial gain without its say-so, the Brando estate has applied for trademark protection with the US patent and trademark office. </p> <p>As a precautionary measure, the application lists items that the estate is concerned might be marketed. So should you want to re-enact the later years of the actor's life, when he lounged around in eccentric seclusion, often dressed as a woman, you will have to forego donning a Brando kimono. </p> <p>Also out of bounds, unless the estate decides to market them, are Brando sunglasses, bottle openers, fridge magnets, mouse pads, key rings, wrapping paper and temporary tattoos. </p> <p>But one of the most famous of Brando's images, after the motorcycle-riding rebel incarnate he played in The Wild One, is beyond the reach of his estate. Rights to The Godfather are owned by Paramount, the studio that made the film. Their rights include the image of Don Vito Corleone, the paterfamilias played by Brando. </p> <p>The estate's action, which aims to prevent any exploitation of the actor's image without its approval, also means that Brando is unlikely, at least in the short term, to go the way of Frank Sinatra, who is the face of a campaign for a leading credit card: credit and debit cards are included in the list submitted by the estate. </p> <p>\"The last thing I'm going to do is something that cheapens Marlon's image,\" Mike Medavoy, the co-executor of the estate and friend of Brando's told the Los Angeles Times. \"You want some sort of blanket protection against anyone doing something that basically goes out and steals his image and puts it on a napkin. This way, you can protect against it.\" </p> <p>Brando set up a trust several years ago to administer any profits that may be made from his image. But the beneficiaries of the trust, including his children, will have no say over the decisions of the estate in approving what may or may not be done with the late actor's likeness. </p> <p>The estate may stand to make further income from the publication of an unfinished novel Brando wrote, according to reports in the New York Post and the Library Journal. Sonny Mehta, of Knopf, apparently bought the manuscript of the novel, Fan-Tan, originally conceived as a film treatment, at the recent Frankfurt Book Fair. It will reportedly be completed by a co-writer. </p> <p>Brando died of lung failure in July at the age of 80. His ashes were scattered in Death Valley, California, and in Tahiti. The actor's estate, valued at $21.6m (\u00a312m), is already the subject of legal wranglings: one of his assistants, Joan Petrone, is seeking $3,000 for a ring she says she lost in Brando's sink while she was making a salad, and an airline is claiming $460,000 for what it says are unpaid costs resulting from flights to Brando's private Polynesian island of Tetiaroa. </p> <p>Brando could prove to be one of the advertising world's most lucrative dead celebrities. Late Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Steve McQueen have gained new audiences thanks to their afterlife roles promoting products. In 1992, the Monroe estate accrued $7m from advertising. Elvis Presley remains the highest-earning late star, according to a 2003 survey by Forbes magazine, which calculated that he had brought in $40m (\u00a322.3m) over the previous year. </p> <p>\"I really believe that Brando could be a brand,\" Jeff Lotman of Global Icons told the LA Times. \"When you have a name like that which is so synonymous with tough and at the same time strength, I think there are things that could be significant.\" </p> <p>He probably wasn't thinking of Brando butter. </p> <p><strong>Brando brands: From mouse pads to confetti</strong></p> <p>Metal statues and figurines not of precious metal; metal key chains; licence plates and frames; bottle openers; non-luminous and non-mechanical metal signs tins and cans sold empty; a series of audio/video recordings; pre-recorded performances and acting lessons; juke boxes; sunglasses; refrigerator magnets; mouse pads; telephone cards; magnetically encoded credit cards and debit cards; musical instruments; drums; percussion instruments and accessories; music boxes; posters; post cards; address books; holiday cards; greeting cards; art prints; art reproductions; paper gift bags; writing instruments; loose leaf binders; bookends; non-fiction and reference books about Marlon Brando; children's activity books; gift wrapping paper; bumper stickers; calendars; non-magnetically encoded telephone calling cards; bank cheques; debit gift cards; chequebook covers; comic books; commemorative stamps not issued by the US Postal Office; confetti; decals; letter openers; paper merchandise; bags; pictures; photographic prints; picture books; playing cards; recipe books; rubber stamps; stationery stickers; temporary tattoos; trading cards; metal trading cards; chalk boards for home and/or school use; photo albums; note pads; paper doll books; colouring books; stamps and philatelic goods, namely, pre-stamped postal cards; coin books; shirts; sweatshirts; pants; shorts; jackets; caps; neckwear; belts; coats; underwear; socks; bath robes; pyjamas; kimonos; gloves; footwear; historical figure licensing services<br> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Source: US Patent and Trademark Office</p>",
  "<p>Plans for an all-new formula one team backed by Dubai's ruling Al Maktoum family have been strengthened with the announcement that a high-level collaboration with McLaren-Mercedes is being negotiated. </p> <p>Grand Prix Investments, the company behind Team Dubai F1, confirmed on Saturday that the team will make their debut at the start of the 2006 season and have already raised the funds to post the $48m bond which the FIA requires from every new formula one team. This sum will be repaid, with interest, on a monthly basis throughout the team's first year of competition. </p> <p>Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, president of Dubai Civil Aviation and a key backer of the team, said: \"Dubai is committed to developing and supporting world-class expertise in carefully targeted high-technology industries. Formula one, with its focus on technological and engineering innovation, provides the perfect environment in which to develop and demonstrate our skills in these cutting-edge areas.\" </p> <p>Norbert Haug, the Mercedes motorsport vice-president, said: \"I can confirm that we are negotiating with Dubai F1 in respect of a supply of engines and a technical cooperation with McLaren-Mercedes. Both sides have agreed on exclusivity of those negotiations.\" </p> <p>Team Dubai F1, who will site their manufacturing base in Britain, will be the first fully independent team to appear in formula one since Stewart-Ford in 1997. It is also clear from its planned links with McLaren-Mercedes that the new organisation has the \u00a3110m-plus funding necessary to establish the team on a serious basis from the outset. </p> <p>The news that the Dubai consortium has decided to start from scratch rather than buy an existing team will disappoint Eddie Jordan, who has made it no secret that his Silverstone-based team are for sale. He had been in contact with the Al Maktoums and is also understood to be in negotiations with Christian Horner, the owner of the Arden formula 3000 team for whom Vitantonio Liuzzi won the 2004 international championship. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jenson Button will have to wait until Wednesday to hear whether he is tied to BAR for next season or is contractually free to join the rival BMW Williams team. The FIA contracts recognition board met in Milan on Saturday to consider his conflicting contracts but deferred announcing its decision, which had been expected to be made public today.</p>",
  "<p>Jonny Wilkinson has not lost his gift for last-minute drama. The golden boy saved Newcastle Falcons with the final kick of yesterday's match, taking a short pass and swinging his left boot crisply through the ball in a single action to slot the drop-goal that secured a precious draw with Saracens. A dozen minutes earlier, however, he had silenced his home crowd when he rose from a tackle and suddenly bent double, his left hand clutching his rigid right arm in a manner all too familiar to those who have followed his remarkable career. </p> <p>Four weeks before he is due to make his first appearance at Twickenham as the successor to Lawrence Dallaglio England's new captain was showing that the question of his physical fitness is by no means fully resolved. The operation to widen a nerve channel and remove a bone spur last February kept him out of the game for eight months but has not, it appears, totally eradicated the \"stingers\" - the deadening of an arm - that he has suffered intermittently since the age of 14. </p> <p>None of this has reduced Wilkinson's obsession with becoming a better rugby player. On Wednesday he was desperate to watch England's match in Azerbaijan but a couple of missed kicks in training kept him out on the pitch at Kingston Park, the floodlights blazing down on his lonely toil while his team-mates clustered around the television in the clubhouse. And in the England squad's most recent set of fitness examinations, conducted at Loughborough College, he came top in every test, breaking the record in several disciplines. </p> <p>But shining in tests in a gym is not the same as surviving in the environment of true competition. A week ago, in Newcastle's defeat at Wasps, his right shoulder made contact with Joe Worsley's head and the blow numbed the arm. He recovered quickly enough and in yesterday's programme notes he issued an assurance that all was well while acknowledging the existence of a haematoma close to the muscles he has been trying to build up. </p> <p>\"Thankfully none of the pain has been anywhere near my neck, where I was injured before,\" he said. \"The neck is stronger than it's ever been and the way it's working with my shoulder now means I'm less susceptible to the sort of pains I was getting before. The severe pain has stopped and, even though there is the odd tingle here and there, it's just down to bad luck. I had pain for years and years and what's great now is that I can move my neck in ways I never could before. The shooting pains are all gone. That's exactly what the operation was for and what the rehab was aimed at, so I'm back to how I should be.\" </p> <p>His optimism will not have extinguished the hopes of England's opponents in the forthcoming series of autumn internationals. The coaches of Canada, South Africa and Australia will have heard the news from Newcastle's last two league fixtures and begun to hatch plans to target English rugby's 25-year-old superstar. </p> <p>For the Springboks, in particular, there will be the dark memory of the equivalent match at Twickenham two years ago. On that occasion their calculated violence availed them nothing as they took a deserved pasting, but a particularly brutal late tackle from Butch James, their centre, provided the first evidence of the physical risks Wilkinson would run on the path to the World Cup final. </p> <p>In Australia a year later he smashed into two tackles that produced similar results, first on Imanol Harinordoquy in the semi-final against France and then against Matt Giteau of Australia in the final itself. Those observers who felt that Wilkinson was sacrificing himself to ensure that England might win the game's supreme trophy will have seen nothing in recent weeks to dissuade them from a collateral belief that he may never be quite the same player again. </p> <p>Yesterday's injury was suffered when Wilkinson tried to halt Hugh Vyvyan, Saracens' No8, who had burst off the back of a five-yard scrum. After lengthy treatment Wilkinson trotted slowly back to his position and, in the second minute of injury-time, proved fit enough to provide the three points that enabled Newcastle to scramble a 20-20 draw. </p> <p>Yet again, however, his appetite for the physical side of the game had put him in harm's way. Never in the history of international rugby has a creative No10 so assiduously dedicated himself to the art of defence, to the point at which, during the World Cup finals, Clive Woodward felt that it was limiting his essential contribution to the team. </p> <p>\"Clive stressed that as the playmaker I was of no use to the side trapped under a pile of bodies at the bottom of a ruck,\" Wilkinson writes in his new book, My World. \"I could see the logic in what he said but it is difficult when you are right beside a tackled colleague - your first instinct is to go in and protect him and the ball. If I could be of use in a physical sense, I wanted to be there. It didn't come naturally to let others do the work.\" </p> <p>He has listened to the advice of those who think that his commitment to stopping opponents by physical force threatens to shorten his career and has rejected it. \"If I stepped back from making big hits, it would take away a lot of the enjoyment for me,\" he says. \"Whenever I watch a match, the thunderous tackles are the incidents I like best.\" </p> <p>Working with his fitness coach, Steve Black, he believes that he has used his convalescence to build himself into an even more formidable player. A man obsessed by setting targets and raising standards cannot bring himself to settle for anything less than constant improvement. </p> <p>Yesterday he kicked two touchline conversions and a penalty, in addition to the drop-goal. He made only one half-break but his distribution was excellent and his long passes to Epi Taione constituted Newcastle's most dangerous attacking ploy. He missed a couple of tackles but connected with rather more. \"He played very well today,\" Rob Andrew, his mentor and Newcastle's director of rugby, said afterwards. \"He defended brilliantly. There were a couple of loose kicks out of hand but he got us going in the second half from an attacking point of view and, with the score at 17-20 and 30 seconds on the clock, he popped over the drop-goal to save the draw.\" </p> <p>And the injury? \"There's a big bruise on his bicep. We'll have to see what the week brings.\" </p> <p>On a flight to Mauritius last February, heading for a post-operative holiday which was to be ruined by paparazzi stalking him and his girlfriend, Wilkinson made a list of short-term goals, something he tends to do when confronting a challenge. This time the usual stuff - pledges to improve his physical strength, to sharpen his skills and to watch his diet - ended with a more plaintive plea to new self: \"To enjoy playing the game of rugby a great deal more.\" Whether that enjoyment can be achieved without a further cost in pain is the big question for the next few weeks, and perhaps for the rest of his life. </p> <p><strong>How 12 months changed the life of English rugby's golden boy</strong></p> <p><strong> October 18, 2003</strong> </p> <p> England's World Cup pool match against South Africa in Perth 12 months ago was vital to their progress in the competition. Their 23-6 victory was emphatic with Wilkinson converting all his kicks at goal, while his Springbok counterpart Louis Koen flopped. </p> <p> <strong> November 22, 2003 </strong> </p> <p> Wilkinson's drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time against the world champions Australia at Sydney's Olympic Stadium confirms the fly-half's reputation as the hottest property in rugby union as Clive Woodward's men take the Webb Ellis trophy home in the most heart-stopping fashion imaginable. Wilkinson is later made an OBE. </p> <p> <strong> December 28, 2003</strong> </p> <p> Wilkinson makes his club comeback for Newcastle but it does not go to plan and his match against Northampton lasts only 53 minutes before he leaves the pitch with a recurrence of his neck and shoulder problems. He joins a list of 15 injured World Cup players. </p> <p> <strong> August 17, 2004</strong> </p> <p> Eight long months pass and Wilkinson makes a low-key return to action following surgery to repair nerve damage to his shoulder. The Newcastle No10 plays for half of their match against Connacht in Galway in front of a crowd of 4,000 which the Falcons win 32-9 and Wilkinson declares that the shoulder is fine. At the age of 25 his career is back on track. </p> <p> <strong> October 4, 2004</strong> </p> <p> England's new coach Andy Robinson announces, after a turbulent month in which Clive Woodward the captain Lawrence Dallaglio resign, that the fly-half is to be the country's new captain for Tests against Canada, South Africa and Australia. \"Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge,\" says Robinson.</p>"
