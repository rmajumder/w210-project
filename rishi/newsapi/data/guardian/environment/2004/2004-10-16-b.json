  "<p>FOR A WOMAN who had got off the red-eye from New York just a few hours earlier, Pamela Thomas-Graham seemed surprisingly bubbly and energetic when I met her recently. </p> <p>The 40-year-old chief executive of CNBC was in London for just a day - welcoming her new European chief, Mick Buckley - before heading off to inspect another part of her global business TV empire. She showed no sign of jetlag or airport fatigue. But then I remembered reading that she was one of those infuriating people, like Napoleon and Baroness Thatcher, who could exist, indeed thrive, on just a few hours sleep a night. </p> <p>That ability must be one of the reasons for the achievements she has chalked up in her remarkable professional career. She is one of the few black women at the helm of a US corporation, as she was the first to break into the almost exclusively male preserve of partnership at the waspish management consultant, McKinsey. She is about to start work on her latest novel, the fourth in a series of mystery tales involving a black female economics professor at an Ivy League college (Thomas-Graham went to Harvard); and she is the mother of three children, including twins just approaching their second birthday. </p> <p>It makes me tired just thinking about it, but she takes it all in her stride. Her day begins at 4am, with a couple of hours' writing before the children wake up. 'I always read lots when I was a child, and when I went to Harvard Law School I wanted to exercise the creative side of my mind. Mysteries are such a fun genre,' she explains. </p> <p>She has some 'quality time' with the children before heading to her office, and is sometimes home to put them to bed. Other responsibilities - she is on the board of the New York Opera and the American Red Cross - can make it a very long day. </p> <p>The heroine of the novels, Nikki Chase, is 'smart and sassy and sexy', according to the blurb of the latest, Orange Crushed . She too puts in the hours, ruffles feathers and upsets reputations in her quest for the truth about a murdered Princeton academic. It is no surprise to find that Thomas-Graham admits to a touch of autobiographical inspiration for her character. </p> <p>'Sure, she deals with lots of the challenges I've also faced. In the USA in the 1990s, you didn't find women or coloured people in senior management roles. They faced a set of issues which were quite unique, in that most people in business simply did not know women of colour. As you began to advance in your career, it made you very visible, and got you noticed at work. That was good if you were getting noticed for positive things, but if you made mistakes they got extrapolated onto the rest of the minority.' </p> <p>From respectable middle-class origins in Detroit, she was made chief executive of CNBC in the summer of 2001, just a few weeks before the 11 September terrorist attacks that changed everything for America. 'The first six months were like The Perfect Storm ', she remembers. 'The financial markets were in recession after the internet bubble, then came the corporate scandals like Enron and WorldCom. And 9/11 on top of all that. Overnight, we went from being a peacetime to a wartime economy.' </p> <p>This presented unique problems for CNBC. The channel, with its running ticker-tape of Wall Street share prices, market updates and talking heads assuming 'buy' or 'sell' positions, was a score board for the financial community. Its interviews with business leaders had the air of a papal audience, where the anchor and the audience were content just to listen to the great man's words. That changed. 'Suddenly, the business leaders became con artists in many people's eyes,' says Graham. 'What do you do then?' </p> <p>The answer was to go 'broader and deeper', she says. 'From being a stock-market channel we became a business news channel, and that was a big difference. We had to become multi-dimensional, with a greater focus on the economy, on Washington, on security and foreign affairs. We realised that how safe people feel at home was probably the most important factor in how they invest. And we had to become more sceptical and probing.' </p> <p>The channel had to expand its global coverage. This was partly a response to the greater importance of international events and how they impacted on US business, but it was also a sound commercial strategy. 'We have access to 200 million households around the world, and we'd never fully leveraged that.' </p> <p>It was a business opportunity just waiting to be exploited. </p> <p>According to the market surveys, CNBC viewers are 'high net worth individuals', with average assets of $1m each. Some 90 per cent have degrees, and they are intelligent, sophisticated and discriminating. 'Our audience will hang on in there and won't feel the need to have things dumbed down for them,' she says. She calls the channel the business network of record, and compares it to the Wall Street Journal in reliability and depth of its coverage. The link to the Journal goes further than that - Dow Jones is a CNBC partner, via the ultimate holding company, the giant General Electric Corporation. </p> <p>Other media organisations have learnt that foreign news networks are expensive and management intensive, but CNBC's business model is different, says Graham. Broadcasts from outside the US are centred on the great financial capitals of the world - London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Hong Kong and Tokyo - where business news can be presented in a direct way. </p> <p>This allows CNBC to fund more 'in-depth' analysis of national and regional economies, and industrial and financial sectors, in special reports and set-pieces from, for example, the Davos summit or Paris airshow. </p> <p>The channel's financial performance is not stripped out from its parent NBC Universal, but, with premium advertising rates for its top-notch audience, she says it is 'highly profitable. GE is a very demanding parent.' </p> <p>After her whistlestop tour of CNBC's global network, she is back in the States (homes in Manhattan and Westchester) to supervise coverage of the presidential election. 'There are two issues: Iraq and the economy. Obviously we will focus on the economy, and we have to answer the question of how the CEOs vote.' </p> <p>If this is a sign that she's going to tell me whether she is for George Bush or John Kerry, she never follows through, and we become diverted to another subject before I get the chance to ask. So I don't know how Pamela Thomas-Graham is going to vote in this election. </p> <p>Her background and east coast lifestyle say Democrat, her position as a self-made business leader says Republican. Take your pick. </p> <p>But for what it's worth, I reckon Nikki Chase would definitely be for Kerry. </p> <p><strong>Thoughts of Nikki Chase:</strong></p> <p><strong> ON RACE</strong> </p> <p>'Now we were both successful black women at Harvard. We should have been close friends and allies - but apparently Janice felt the place was too small for the two of us. And she would be thrilled to see me gone. It was sad, but true: the old school HNIC phenomenon (that would be Head Nigger In Charge) was very much alive and well in our generation.' </p> <p><strong> ON MEN</strong> </p> <p>'One of the well-established perks of an academic conference is the opportunity to flirt shamelessly. But after the autumn I'd just had, flirting with handsome dark-eyed men fell into the high-risk category' </p> <p><strong> ON CAREERS</strong> </p> <p>'In another life, Gwen might have been one of those smart, wise-cracking secretaries in a 1930s screwball comedy. Now it was a different century, and she was going to night school to get a degree in education'</p>",
  "<p>IF YOU haven't produced a new weekly magazine in the past 12 months you are out of fashion in publishing circles. Weeklies are the new black; the accessory that no self-respecting magazine publisher can afford to be without. There are now some 20 serious contenders in the sector and although golden oldie Take a Break still tops the charts with a weekly sale of 1.2 million, at least half of the titles are recent entries, pushing turnover to more than \u00a3400m; a quarter of the entire magazine market. </p> <p>This week it was the turn of National Magazines, more usually associated with stalwart monthlies such as Good Housekeeping and Cosmopolitan, and certainly not a natural contender for the cutthroat weekly market. </p> <p>Yet Reveal, with a print run of 600,000 given away free, a future cover price of \u00a31 and a \u00a310 million marketing budget, shows no signs of being an also-ran - despite the fact that it bears an uncanny resemblance to Emap's super-successful Closer ( circulation 477,000) and is late on the scene behind IPC, Bauer, Emap and, of course, Richard Desmond. </p> <p>Judging by the tension and secrecy surrounding the launch, this is 'heads-on-the-block' time. As Nat Mags is well aware, the thing about weekly magazines is not the amount of money you stand to make if they are successful, it's the amount you'll lose if they're not. </p> <p>Editor Sarah Edwards is remarkably calm given what is at stake (\u00a316m over three years). Trained on news and features by legendary Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, she clearly thrives on tabloid pressure but having edited, among others, That's Life, she also understands the very different ebb and flow of magazines. Is she worried that Reveal, on the outside anyway, looks exactly like all the other celebrity magazines? </p> <p>'This is not a celebrity title,' she says confidently, 'this is a modern women's weekly. We have celebrities on the cover because that's what makes people pick up a magazine but Reveal has much broader appeal than the others.' </p> <p>Edwards wants her readers to 'laugh, gasp and cry' but also to know which boots to wear with which skirt, what to throw on a pizza base for a quick supper and how to deal with the health issues that really matter. These are the ingredients of the traditional women's weeklies and her plan is to give them a modern spin with great celebrity stories. ('It's no good just having the photos,' she says), real-life features that 'talk to women's insecurities and help them through life', plus 'targeted TV listings for added value'. </p> <p>She agrees that Closer ('a fantastic magazine') is attempting the same package, but claims readers can see through the wrapping. 'There's no point in flinging 50 skirts on a page without showing how to wear them and there's no way readers will pick up the emotional punch of a real-life story unless it is presented properly.' </p> <p>Reveal is cleverly edited to deliver at a pace that suits time-hungry modern living. Edwards refers to 'a little hook on every page; a little button that you just have to press. We make everything achievable and then add a bit extra. Everybody likes a little extra fact.' </p> <p>The result means you can flick through and not feel disappointed; highlighted boxes on every feature give you a quick precis of what's in store so that you don't have to waste time with the full text if it doesn't appeal. Fashion and beauty start with the reader rather than the products; problem, solution, shape, choice - simply find yourself and off you go. And then there's that 'little extra fact': '9 out of 10 women wear shoes that are too small' etc, etc. Spread over 100 pages it certainly feels like value for money; too much, almost. </p> <p>But how will the average consumer, already bombarded by a bewildering choice of titles, select one over another? The answer is she probably won't. 'She'll buy a number of magazines, both weeklies and monthlies,' says Edwards. 'I know plenty of mummies' (she has two children, ages three and five) 'who buy, say, Good Housekeeping and a celebrity title one week and then a couple more weeklies the next with maybe Prima thrown in.' This multiple buying is what has made weeklies so popular with publishers. Given that loyalty to any one title is becoming a thing of the past it's infinitely more attractive to have four shots at a buyer during the month than just one. If you can sell, say, 500,000 copies a week, why on earth would you restrict yourself to a mere 500,000 a month? </p> <p>'There's still plenty of energy and growth in the monthly market,' says Simon Kippen, publisher of Conde Nast's extraordinarily successful monthly Glamour. The title has recently soared to a circulation of 605,000, the biggest-selling women's monthly in Europe and all 'whilst the market has been flooded with these new weeklies', he says. </p> <p>The secret for monthlies, of course, is that they have two very healthy revenue streams - circulation and advertising - whereas weeklies have to rely principally on circulation. Jessica Burley, publisher of Reveal, hopes that once her title is up and running it will attract about 15 pages of advertising an issue. She points out that her other weekly title, Best, brings in the largest amount of advertising of any women's weekly, 780 pages a year. Heady as this may seem, it's nothing by comparison with Glamour's average of 45 per cent advertising which, given that the next issue is over 450 pages, is riches indeed. </p> <p>Kippen, as ever, is generous in his success, marvelling at the rapid growth of weekly titles whilst confirming that Conde Nast has no desire to join the fray. 'I suppose it depends on what appeals; if you like snacking on biscuits then you're a weekly person, but if you prefer a decent meal then it's a monthly.' </p> <p>Many advertisers used to dismiss weeklies as being too 'throw away', whereas monthlies pile up readers through 'pass on'. However, this has become less crucial. </p> <p>'As long as a title offers high traffic and the right environment it doesn't matter if it's thrown away,' confirms Mark Gallagher, director of Manning Gottlieb OMD. 'These new weeklies will be very attractive to advertisers as long as they speak to different groups of readers. The danger is if they just add frequency.' </p> <p>Gallagher thinks the new breed of weeklies will give the monthlies a run for their money. 'These magazines are giving readers what they want in a nice jacket. They can read Closer or Reveal or one of the celebrity titles on the train without feeling downmarket.' </p> <p>'Mass with class' is how National Magazines refers to it and it's something the creative team at Clemmow Hornby Inge, which produced Reveal's TV ads, have latched on to. </p> <p>'People in media like to say celebrity is dying,' says director Danny Josephs, 'but Reveal was researched for over a year starting with almost no celebrity content and people didn't want it. It's the celebrities that take readers in and allow the publishers to add all the other bits.' </p> <p>But aren't these 'other bits' universal throughout the women's weeklies? 'To rely on content alone is dangerous; any publisher can buy content,' says Daniels. 'What differentiates one title from another is tone and how it markets itself.' </p> <p>Presuming that Reveal has captured the right tone and marketing approach, National Magazines plans to become a real player in the sector through its new joint venture with Australian Consolidated Press; ACP-NatMag. It believes that it can take on IPC and Emap despite Nat Mags' parent company, the giant American Hearst Corporation, having no experience in this market. </p> <p>Duncan Edwards, managing director of National Magazines, says: 'The Americans are watching what is happening in the UK with very great interest.' I bet they are. </p> <p><strong>Sally O'Sullivan is editorial director of Highbury House. </strong></p>",

  "<p>Michael has cerebral palsy with moderate disabilities due to medical negligence at birth. He writes: </p> <p>'My mobility is restricted, my eyesight is impaired and I am clumsy. Five years ago, I was awarded \u00a3450,000 in medical damages. This has been held in trust by the Court Funds Office until this month when I reach 18 and it becomes my responsibility. </p> <p>I live a relatively normal and independent life for my age. I intend to go to university next year to study politics and something else. </p> <p>University will cost me more than most students because I have to use taxis and buy suitable computer equipment. When I leave home, I will have to pay for help with food, laundry, cleaning and domestic maintenance. Holidays and insurance are more expensive for me. </p> <p>I expect I will have a career but perhaps a part-time rather than full-time job. I should be able to live an independent life, using money from the award to cover extra costs for transport, home help and home adaptations. </p> <p>When I start work, it's quite likely that I will to want to buy a property. </p> <p>In 1999, the award was put into a high-interest savings account. In 2001, the Court Funds Office strongly advised that half be invested in shares. This was worth about \u00a3250,000 at the time but is now worth about \u00a3165,000. The rest of my money remained in the cash account and now comes to \u00a3305,000. </p> <p>I will need some annual income to support my education and enhance my lifestyle but the priority, while I am studying, should be to improve the capital value of my investments. </p> <p>That said, I need to make substantial provision for my later life as my disabilities are likely to affect me more then and may be complicated by other health problems. So a substantial portion of the award should be invested now to provide me with financial security later. </p> <p>My most immediate question is what to do about my current portfolio of investments. Should some or all be sold, or retained in the expectation that their performance eventually proves worthwhile? </p> <p>The other question is what to do with the \u00a3300,000 in cash. I think that much of this should also be invested but I do not want to repeat the mistake of three years ago. Also, as I will now become liable for tax, perhaps I should have an offshore bank account.' <br><strong>Michael</strong></p> <p><strong>Buy a property without delay</strong><br> You face critical investment decisions and, although we give some suggestions here, you must talk it through with an experienced financial adviser. </p> <p>First decide how much to keep in cash and how much to invest for the longer term. Anna Bowes, investments manager at Chase de Vere, calculates: 'Michael could earn \u00a318,800 a year before tax if he invested the whole \u00a3470,000 for income, with a little capital growth, at 4 per cent.' </p> <p>That is probably more income than you will need at university, so scale down the proportion providing income and invest the rest entirely for capital growth. </p> <p>Michael Brill, a director at Baronworth, suggests you save \u00a320,000 in an ING Direct deposit account at 5 per cent with instant access. </p> <p>He then recommends putting \u00a350,000 into a Nationwide offshore account: 'The interest is taxable but compounds gross.' Other advisers are less keen on going offshore. Matt Pitcher of Towry Law and Bowes reckons an offshore bank account might be too complicated, because you would have to submit a tax return. </p> <p>With your equity investments, Brill believes: 'It's not a bad idea to cut his losses on the existing investments and go into something safer.' He suggests putting \u00a3200,000 into a guaranteed growth bond or guaranteed income bond paying 4.7 per cent net, worth 5.88 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer, for three years with no risk. Or a distribution bond such as Axa Sun Life or Legal and General's where half is invested in gilts, fixed interest and cash and you can take 5 per cent income a year without tax: 'He could cash it in if he buys a property in five or six years' time.' </p> <p>Pitcher recommends keeping the existing investments in the hope that they recover: 'The investments made in 2001 seem to consist of investment trusts and unit trusts almost exclusively investing in the stock market, with little exposure to other assets such as fixed-interest securities and property.' </p> <p>Bowes comments: 'It's understandable to feel nervous about investing in anything other than cash after his experience, but three years really is a short investment timescale. I suggest spreading the money 50 per cent in shares, 25 per cent in fixed interest and 25 per cent in property. The shares should be mainly UK-based, in equity income funds, but some global exposure is important. Fixed interest will provide the bulk of the income and will also diversify the risk.' </p> <p>Pitcher suggests a fund supermarket such as Co-funds to consolidate your unit trust portfolio in one place: 'Many of his existing unit trusts can be transferred at no cost. I suggest Michael uses Cofunds to maximise his Isa allowance of \u00a37,000 a year as well. He should then look for a balanced portfolio that includes gilts, corporate bonds and commercial property as well as shares for his new investments.' </p> <p>Mark Quilter is a divisional director at Gerrard and for the last 16 years has invested money for people under the Mental Health Act and who are recipients of personal injury and damages awards: 'I suggest Michael uses at least half the large cash balance to buy a property as he will definitely need a property to live in. With the likelihood of property prices continuing to rise over the longer term, any delay could prove to be a mistake. Holding a property will also diversify Michael's portfolio.' </p> <p>Bowes points out that working part-time could result in a smaller pension so suggests starting a stakeholder pension now: '... although this is not such a good idea if his life expectancy is shorter than normal as it will tie up money that he may never benefit from.' You could take money from your deposit account to pay premiums of \u00a32,808 a year which the Inland Revenue tops up to \u00a33,600. </p> <p>Finally Bowes advises: 'Michael should put the bulk of the money into a trust immediately and arrange for a power of attorney in case, later on, he suffers mental incapacity. With the settlement, he would lose any means-tested state benefits he might receive but settling the money into trust shelters it from means-testing.' </p> <p><strong>Michael's to-do list</strong> <br>1. See a financial adviser before making any investment decisions. </p> <p>2. Consider putting the award in trust. </p> <p>3. Keep enough to pay for university and buy a property. </p> <p>4.

  "<p>A bit of a Rudyard Kipling-like exhortation to keep your head while all about you are losing theirs, this - inspired by watching the American presidential debates and lamenting how much of the world seems to be beguiled by style over content: slick or not-so-slick acting over authenticity, and flimsy bravado over common sense. It's as if we've given up on the genuine article and are more comfortable with parody - even when what's at stake is our very survival as a species. It's the postmodern condition - and while generally a pretty up-to-the-minute sort of chap, I feel it would be wiser to retrench, to reconnect with an aspect of Kipling's era, when people - albeit repressed and often miserable - still displayed some sense of value, of what was decent. Or maybe I'm idealising the past. Nonetheless, I'm standing up for a return to human decency, a return to valuing content over style, to valuing the very miracle of our existence, instead of projecting all our aspirations for a meaningful life on to celebrities who between them have as much genuine talent and about as much to actually offer the world as a bunch of bananas.</p> <p>I'm not suggesting a political movement at all. I suggest a radical revision on an individual basis: each of us coming awake to what's going on - the level of crisis we face in every aspect of human society - and then taking full responsibility for creating a personal environment of integrity and honour, concepts now so old-fashioned even the words sound dated. But if each of us can start living again according to such standards, we will have a chance of teaching by example, and will possibly influence a trend.</p> <p>We have been witnessing a gross deterioration in intellectual standards across the board - a vast and insidious EastEnders- or Coronation Street-style dumbing down of reality. I feel it's our duty, those of us with brains not yet addled by alcohol, numbed by TV or sullied by overexposure to the tabloid press, to make this stand together - a last stand, perhaps, against the ravages of mediocrity. </p> <p>Are you with me?

  "<p>No on likes to be the bearer of bad news, but here it is anyway. America does not care about us. Not in a bad way, not in a cold, calculated way. More in a not-really-noticing-us kind of way. Like an annoying little yapping dog barking at a friendly Alsatian, Britain will get the odd quizzical glance from America, the occasional playful lick. But generally, America has much better things to do. Britain's special relationship with America is special only to Britain. </p> <p>After moving to America a year ago as The Observer 's US correspondent, I can vouch that the divide between how Britain sees America and how America sees Britain has never seemed wider. While Britain worships at the altar of Americana, following every twist and turn in American political and cultural life, America responds by ... well, by just being American. </p> <p>Just look at the reaction to Madonna's decision to settle in Britain or any of the frequent rumours that Hollywood's stars are buying houses in London. Britain gushes over the story and acres of newsprint hit the streets. The yapping dog starts barking at the top of its lungs. Britain appears to need the validation of ageing American singers and actors. America does not respond in kind. If British stars move to Hollywood, the reaction is that there is no reaction. After all, American thinking goes that of course they would want to live in Hollywood. That's where famous people live. </p> <p>Or to put it another way, look at the coverage Britain devotes to Martha Stewart's trials and tribulations. Stewart is explained as America's Delia Smith. That is true. But if Delia was heading to jail in her beloved Norwich, do you think anyAmerican newspaper would write even a single paragraph about it? </p> <p>This is true in politics, too. Many Americans love Tony Blair. He is a very popular figure here across the political spectrum. The same people who love Blair tend to love Margaret Thatcher with equal devotion. Both leaders are measured by a single yardstick: what did you do for America? In both cases, the answer is quite a lot. What they did for Britain is not even in the question. Loyalty to Washington is what is rewarded. The real question is why should America care? And the answer is: no reason at all. America is simply too big to care. </p> <p>In the past year, I have travelled from the deserts of Arizona to the swamps of Louisiana, from the prairies of Kansas to the urban mass of New York, from the tiny, picture-perfect towns of New Hampshire to the ranges of Texas. The variety of America is stunning. I have been to the Hopi reservation where Native Americans ban the prying eyes of white people from their villages. </p> <p>In Pennsylvania, German-speaking Amish shun modern equipment on their farms. In Utah, Mormons, who believe Jesus visited America after being crucified, pretty much run an entire state. The idea of America as a land of endless suburban conformity is a myth. American accents are as varied as any in Britain. </p> <p>Many Americans simply don't need to leave their country to look at the rest of the world and so often don't. The distances are vast, anyway. In many parts of the country, having a passport is rare. Added to that is the fact that Americans often only have two weeks holiday a year. They just don't have the time to see the world. If you fly for an hour or so from London, you can reach a half-a-dozen countries; in America, you might not even leave your home state. </p> <p>The US also has its own sports. Baseball, basketball and American football are followed as religiously here as association football is elsewhere. It does not matter a jot to America that few other countries play them. Coupled to that is a sense of fierce civic pride that Britain does not match. People who live in small-town America often believe they really do live in Best Place, USA. </p> <p>Then there is the whole superpower issue. America is concerned only with what is good for America. That is what superpowers do. When Britain was in that position 100 years ago, it was noted for its 'splendid isolation'. The same is now true of America and the global fallout from the Iraq war. Many Americans do not feel isolated from the world; they feel that the world is isolated from America. </p> <p>The British are deluded by the fact that they share a language with America. In some ways, it would be better if the Americans and the British did not both speak English. The British then would feel as foreign as they often should do. Just because we understand what an American is saying does not mean that we understand what they are talking about. We don't make a translation, but much of the time, we should. </p> <p>And while we celebrate America in all its glory, America does not return the favour. Britain is just not that important. Tony Blair's heart operation and declaration that he would serve a full third term made it into the papers here. Just. USA Today, the only American newspaper widely available across the whole country, carried it as a lead item in its news in brief section. </p> <p>The picture that emerges of Britain from the American press is not a complex one. It is a land of eccentrics and tweeness, stately homes and tea drinking. It is a place where judges wear wigs and there really are lords and ladies. Britain is seen as a medieval theme park (and we don't help our cause one bit by getting in such a state over hunting foxes). </p> <p>Reigning over it all, of course, is the Queen. Batman's recent appearance at Buckingham Palace caused a bit of a stir on this side of the Atlantic. But it was on the late-night comedy shows, not the cause of soul-searching over security arrangements in the post-9/11 world. </p> <p>The situation was reversed for the deportation of Yusuf Islam/Cat Stevens as a suspected terrorist. In Britain, the story was seen as a joke (in slightly poor taste). In America, it was taken as a genuine scandal which exposed the terrible laxness of airlines when it came to keeping out dangerous Islamic militants. </p> <p>Perhaps it is too harsh to call Britain a yapping dog. The 'special relationship' is more like a slightly geeky teenager who falls head over heels in love with the best-looking guy in the school. The teenager moons over her beloved; every look and word is analysed for its meaning, significance and importance. Tears are shed; fantasies are indulged; long nights pass without sleep. </p> <p>The British teenage girl never realises that the good-looking American guy has not really noticed her. He's thinking about sports, sex and study. His life is quite full enough already. All that agonising is for nothing. That is sad and, like most terrible teenage crushes, this one isn't healthy. But it isn't going to go away. Or, at least, not until Britain does some serious growing up. </p> <p><strong>Americans are couch potatoes -<br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>99% of all American households own at least one television; 66% of households have at least three TV sets. The TV is on for an average of six hours and 47 minutes per day in the average American home; around 49% of Americans think they watch too much television. American children will watch around 8,000 murders on television before they have finished elementary school.<br><strong>Frances Tillson</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sources CNN, USA Today, Fox News, Christian Broadcasting Network</p>",
  "<p>Here they come. They have been called, but the movement is hardly noticeable at first. People shuffling along rows of seats, excuse me, ma'am, excuse me, sir, in ones and twos. Married couples in matching shirts holding hands. Now, some groups of giggling teenage girls, wondering if they should, smoothing their hair, checking their bags. Young men holding Bibles. Enormous people in outsize shorts, following their bellies, manoeuvring gargantuan backsides through gaps in the crowd, gripping half-gallons of Coke. People with sticks, on the arms of carers, watching every step. A silent army descending solemnly in bright white Reeboks and Nikes. </p> <p>Soon the first few make it down on to the magic green of the floodlit grass of Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs. They are drawn to the centre, the few joining with others, the luminous turf steadily covered. At either end of the stadium - a great concrete oval of orange plastic seating soaring up to the black night sky - on enormous flat screens a vast face is watching their progress, unmoving. </p> <p>It is a face that demands to be on a stamp, or the back of a dollar bill, or carved into rock: the slightly hook nose, the firm jaw, the eyes darting under heavy brows, the silver hair swept back just so. It is a face that has been on screens just like these, framed by advertisements for Budweiser and Pizza Hut and First National Bank, all over the world. A face that created this very spectacle 60 years ago, has seen it unfold inevitably a thousand times and never tired of it. Occasionally, a hand, shaking now a little with Parkinson's and age, moves up to those huge projected eyes, as if maybe ( who knows? ) to stop a tear in its tracks. </p> <p>This is the third night of Billy Graham's crusade to Kansas City, to the heart of the heart of America, and the numbers of the saved are slowly growing. Evangelists normally love lightning - apocalyptic forks of it appear on the covers of several of Graham's million-selling books, including Storm Warning and Approaching Hoofbeats - but on the first night of this mission, violent thunder had kept the attendance down to a handful hunkered under stadium overhangs in polythene capes. 'Hell,' as Robert Frost once observed, 'is a half filled auditorium.' </p> <p>Tonight, though, the banked seats are full and Graham can mould that initial adversity, the heavenly downpour, into his sermon, just as he can talk of the great natural disasters that have spared him this year: how he and his family endured at their home in North Carolina hurricanes Ivan and Jean; how 169 bridges were swept away from their neighbouring valleys; how a huge mudslide passed within 12 feet of their timber house; how they lost their generator and lived in darkness for several days, Graham himself bedbound recovering from a broken pelvis. And so on. Until it is hard not to believe, as bright-eyed people have been telling me all evening, that it is a miracle the 'America's pastor' is here at all. </p> <p>That opening night was the first time Graham had preached to an audience all year. 'I feel,' he said, his rich voice cracking a little, ever the showman, 'like a teenager. Like I'm starting over.' </p> <p>He approaches the microphone these days, at 85, on a Zimmer frame, helped by his son. He pauses halfway through his text, a loose aggregation of good ol' boy anecdote and scaremongering scripture, to take a seat. As he watches the people come on down to be born again, he leans forward every now and then to remind them of the urgency of the moment, the lateness of the hour. And all the time he speaks, as his volunteer tellers take the names of those baseball-capped souls who will, no doubt, be joining him in paradise, you are invited to think of the numbers whose names have been entered in this way before, of all the statistics that stack up behind him. </p> <p>America loves zeroes and, if nothing else, Billy Graham provides the reassurance of noughts, the comforting economies of scale. This is his 435th Crusade; he has preached live to 210 million people in 185 countries; more than any man who ever lived. He has provided guidance for almost every American President since Truman. He was Nixon's close confidant, Reagan's devout ally. He stood at George Bush senior's side, Bible in hand, when the President launched Operation Desert Storm. He helped George W Bush through his drinking problems. He has more appearances on Time magazine's annual list of the 10 most admired people in the world - 46 - than anyone else. </p> <p>Though these facts come thick and fast, it is another of the evening's big numbers that gives me particular pause. Each night in Kansas City, the Crusade proceedings are opened with a brisk bit of business. This four-day event will cost, we are told, $4.8 million. This is to be raised by donations. 'Pull the envelope out of your programme, pay by credit card, write a cheque or simply put cash in it,' says one of Billy's sharp-suited warm-up men. 'Better still, just give us your wallet,' he suggests, before adding, 'I'm kidding about that last one.' </p> <p>The faithful may have only to walk out on to a football field to ensure ever lasting life, but, it seems, salvation does not come cheap. As the lines of people file down I do a quick calculation. Each saved soul is currently coming in at about $750 a pop. </p> <p>Then, as soon as the God-fearing men and women of Kansas are assembled, Billy Graham gets up, his work complete. Tomorrow, he says, he'll talk about 'the Day of Judgment, and about the great tribulation of the end times when some will be taken up to heaven and many will be left behind'. 'It should,' as Graham's sidekick of 50 years, Cliff Barrow, points out, 'be a very enjoyable afternoon. Bring your friends!' </p> <p>In essayist Thomas Frank's book, What's the Matter With Kansas? (published here as What's the Matter with America?) , he explores the reasons why the American heartland and, particularly, his home city, has turned so resolutely to God and the right. Historically, Kansas is a blue-collar state, the most 'normal' place in America, where Superman grew up and where Dorothy yearned to return. These days, conservative commentators like to call Kansas City the capital of 'red America', the great swath of the country that has come out in recent elections for Republicans and shows up crimson on electoral maps. It is, for them, a 'region of humility, guilelessness, and, above all, of stout yeoman righteousness ' as compared to the blue of the coastal conurbations, where people are 'unobservant, liberal-minded, relativistic'. </p> <p>David Brooks, writing approvingly in the Atlantic Monthly , described the population of red America as 'perfectly happy to be slightly overweight and a little underpaid'. Ann Coulter, the author of the number one bestseller How to talk to a Liberal (If you must), calls Kansas City her 'favourite place in the world ... they're Americans, they are great, they are rooting for America. I mean, there is so much common sense!' Billy Graham shares this feeling: 'You are the best people in America!' he repeatedly tells his heartland audience, by which he means, really, you are the best people in the world. </p> <p>'Kansas,' Thomas Frank argues, 'may be the land of averageness, but it is a freaky, militant, outraged averageness.' The Kansas state-school board has cleansed the curriculum of the necessity of teaching evolution. Public events, including the Billy Graham Crusades, are picketed by people with banners proclaiming that God Hates Fags. Pro-life spectaculars are routine. There is something very appropriate about the fact that Kansas City's biggest export is Hallmark Cards, flogging overpriced platitudes to the world (the Hall family, who own the company, are the Republicans' biggest donors in the state). </p> <p>In this climate, Graham's brand of commercial self-righteousness plays perfectly. ('God,' as Frank says, 'meets Mammon'). The evangelist, I am repeatedly told, is the 'real deal', progenitor of any number of similar Christian enterprises, but the original and still the best. He offers a version of Christianity which is shaped to fit American capitalism and individualism and, moreover, which supports a traditional, parochial American way of life and American power in the world. </p> <p>He is not so much a preacher as a broker offering stock options in God's corporate plan. Unlike most pastors, he does not have to bury the dead, perform weddings or organise bring and buy sales. 'I would love to see you all for a cup of tea,' he says to those who come forward, 'but we will have plenty of time for that in heaven.' </p> <p>What he - and the rest of his far more wacko imitators - offers to the heartland is certainty and safety, as well as a sense of affirmation of their morals. This sense of shared value is more a style than a rigorous programme. Frank argues that of all the divides in America, the key one is between the perceived authenticity of tradition-minded red America and its godless liberal nemesis. 'While liberals commit endless acts of hubris, sucking down lattes, driving European cars, trying to reform the world, the humble people of the red states go about their unpretentious business, eating down-home foods, whistling while they work and knowing they are secure under the watch of George W Bush, a man they love as one of their own.' </p> <p>The great lie of this position, Frank argues, is that Bush has done more to undermine those traditional American values, by pandering to vast corporations, by slashing the tax burden of the rich, by rushing America to war, than almost any President in history. In this, though, Bush is convinced, he has God (and Billy Graham) on his side. Rarely has it been more straightforward for a rich man to feel eligible for a celestial upgrade than in Bush's America. </p> <p>At 85, Billy Graham is planning just two more Crusades, one in Los Angeles next month and one in New York next year. Then he will see how he feels and probably hand all of the work over to his son, Franklin. This process of the succession has already begun. Franklin is 'CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association', which has just moved into a new $13m headquarters in North Carolina (and which has an annual turnover, used mainly to run its Crusades, of $109m). He draws a 'modest' salary of around $200,000 (his father, reluctantly, takes a little more) plus the use of the corporate plane, which he flies across the globe. He provided the blessing at the inauguration of Bush, just as his father had blessed Bush's father. </p> <p>In a hotel room in Kansas City, I ask Franklin Graham if he feels ready to take on his father's work. </p> <p>'Well,' he says, in his quiet, measured voice, 'nobody can take his place in the world. But I have already done 100 Crusades of my own.' He is off to Nova Scotia in a couple of weeks, then Chile, and so on. </p> <p>Does he share his father's love of the heartland? </p> <p>'People can come and visit New York,' he says. 'But that is not America. Los Angeles is not America. These small places are America: a good work ethic, where people will take care of themselves. And where they live by Christian values.' </p> <p>I wonder if he sees that divide in political terms? </p> <p>'The difference between the political system in this country and many others is that religion is a big part of our life. The media in our country are mostly liberal and they have their ideas. But we have ours.' </p> <p>Franklin Graham became notorious in the first Gulf War by sending thousands of GIs biblical tracts in Arabic, to spread the word among their Saudi hosts. General Norman Schwarzkopf, trying to keep peace with Riyadh, was outraged. Does he regret that? </p> <p>'Here's my feeling,' he says. 'Saudi Arabia asks the United States to come in. But while the Saudis were willing for the blood of American soldiers to be spilled to save their oil fields, US army chaplains were asked to take the cross off their uniforms. I thought that was wrong. The Saudis gave every American soldier material to introduce them to Islam, and I thought we had every right to tell the Saudis what we believe.' </p> <p>Since the inauguration, he says, he has maintained a very close relationship with the current President. </p> <p>'I'm at the White House next week to do a Bible study for the President's staff,' he says. 'I speak to the President's advisers on issues all the time.' </p> <p>Graham has been most involved with formulating the Bush administration's policy on HIV/Aids. It was he who helped to secure the surprise $15 billion earmarked to address the disease worldwide and it was he who helped to shape a policy which favours the preaching of sexual abstinence over the distribution of condoms. </p> <p>'We [should] obey God and his laws,' he says in this regard. 'God has given sex to be used between a man and a woman in marriage, not between two women, not between two men. [If you deviate] sooner or later it is going to destroy your health. It could end your life.' (To protect himself from such temptations of the flesh, like every other man in the Billy Graham organisation, he never allows himself to be alone in a room with a woman other than his wife, Jane Austin, whom he married soon after he was 'born again'.) </p> <p>It is not clear quite how much advice Franklin Graham offers to the White House on foreign policy, though he says he has helped to shape thinking on Sudan, which he has visited on Crusades. After 9/11, he infamously denounced Islam as 'an evil and wicked religion'. I wonder if he stands by that? </p> <p>'It is certainly a very violent religion,' he says. 'You hear the calls from the mullahs every day on the internet. The vast majority are calling for the death of Jews, the killing of Christians. I have not heard one Anglican or one Baptist say we should kill Muslims.' </p> <p>Does he therefore see the current conflict as a struggle between good and evil as his President appears to? </p> <p>'We are in a Third World War. Tony Blair understands that. George Bush understands that. It is a global fight against Islamic fundamentalism.' </p> <p>And do such events, in his opinion, signify the imminent approach of a Judgment Day? </p> <p>'Certainly. I think Judgment Day is approaching fast. I think there are major prophecies that have been fulfilled. The rebirth of Israel. All of this was foretold. The great tribulation will come then. And this world will be judged for rejecting Jesus Christ. In America now, you cannot mention His name on television, you cannot teach the Bible in school, but you can talk of Muhammad all you want. Why is that? Because the great tribulation is coming. The true followers of Jesus will be taken up and the remainder left behind. </p> <p>Does he feel ready for Judgment Day? </p> <p>Franklin Graham flashes a quiet smile, as if the answer were self-evident. </p> <p>There is a measure by which Americans can determine how close we are to the Last Days. They can just log on to the RaptureReady website which monitors the world's press and comes up with a daily 'rapture index'. On the final day of Graham's Crusade, appropriately enough, this index is at an annual high of 155, owing to a couple of reported earthquakes. On the bus to Arrowhead Stadium, along a flat road on which Baptist churches stand side by side with truckstop lap-dancing bars, this sense of impending doom is almost palpable. Particularly for the one man who has turned up with a Kerry/Edwards badge on his coat. </p> <p>'The one thing that Kerry hasn't shown is how he is going to secure America,' the man is told, when he sits down. 'He keeps getting asked, but he doesn't know. He's a flip-flopper.' </p> <p>'At least,' another says, with some certainty, 'Bush doesn't lie to us.' </p> <p>'How can you tell when a liberal is lying?' another wonders, by way of a joke. 'When he opens his mouth.' </p> <p>The man with the badge points quietly to the President's failures in Iraq. </p> <p>'There's more people get killed every day on the freeway than soldiers getting killed in Iraq.' </p> <p>He mentions the trillions of dollars racked up in budget deficit. </p> <p>'You have got to keep a positive approach to life. If you don't, you are going to miss so much about America.' </p> <p>The chief defender of the President's record in this one-sided debate is a man wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logo of the Smiling Bus Chapel, of which he is the proprietor. The Smiling Bus Chapel, he explains, will tour from Minnesota to Texas, saving souls at Greyhound stations and truckstops. It will have an altar and pews on board, as well as 'satellite communications'. </p> <p>'I want American people in heaven,' he explains of his mission. 'The Lord told me to make it easy for people. Billy Graham started all of this, by bringing God out of the church. I make it even easier by coming to them. I tell them they don't have to go to church, they don't have to do any of that. They have to make a commitment in their hearts on my bus.' </p> <p>And do they? I ask </p> <p>'Well,' he explains, 'the bus is not licensed yet.' </p> <p>Shouldn't salvation be a bit more tricky than getting on a bus? I wonder. </p> <p>But by now, the conversation has moved on to the relative merits of Jesus Christ Superstar against The Passion of the Christ. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is the work of the devil apparently (and not just its melodies); the television networks which insist on broadcasting it should be shut down with immediate effect. Mel Gibson's epic, meanwhile, is the Word of God, or as close as we are ever likely to come to it. On this, there is agreement from Republicans and Democrats alike. </p> <p>At the Arrowhead Stadium, after the usual preamble about the shortfall in contributions and a plea to stump up the remaining $1.8m ('We're not leaving until we have it'), Graham launches, as promised into his apocalyptic stride. He is not going to talk politics, he says, it is not appropriate at election time. 'Still,' he suggests with a smile, 'I have my views. I think you can guess 'em.' Fifty thousand Kansans can. </p> <p>And, really, politics is what he does talk. In between anecdotes about down- home folks from Texas, he lists the world's horrors, the things all right- thinking Kansans should fear. The papers are full of crime, killing and rape. There are hurricanes in Florida; there are locusts in West Africa. In Haiti, apparently, they are 'eating each other'. All these are signs, signs that the Second Coming is upon us, that the End Times are approaching. And chief among these celestial signals 'is what is happening in the Middle East ...' </p> <p>Graham hardly needs to elaborate further, before allowing the stadium to fall silent and offer his audience their solution. 'The choice is yours,' he says. </p> <p>And right on cue, here they come again. Slowly filing down the aisles. Ready to join their fellow Americans in eternal life. </p> <p><strong>All Americans believe in God - <br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>Mostly true. 64% of Americans believe in God, 17% believe but sometimes have doubts, 4% believe only part of the time; only 15% of the population are atheists. All of the believers are convinced to a greater or lesser extent that America has a special place in God's plan, with around 25% believing that it is God's chosen country - offering as evidence the US's 'superior' democracy and fabulous wealth.</p>",
  "<p>AS A WRECKER of reputations, retail takes some beating. The roll call of the fallen is lengthy. From Marks &amp; Spencer: Roger Holmes, Luc Vandevelde and Vittorio Radice. From Sainsbury's: Sir Peter Davis. Boots said goodbye to Steve Russell and WH Smith has booted Richard Handover upstairs to await departure in January. </p> <p>There are more. Paul Mason (ex-chief executive at Matalan), Chris Martin (formerly of Mothercare) and Geoff Mulcahy (the brains behind B&amp;Q) had perfectly sound track records before they foundered on the retail rocks. </p> <p>What is it that makes this corner of the business world such a tough place? 'Everybody is interested in retail because they can relate to it,' says Nigel Whittaker, a retailer turned rescuer of reputations. 'The personalities who get to the top are, on the whole, particularly strong characters. They get a high profile in a positive way on the way up, then the pedestal syndrome kicks in with some journalists. There is also an element of \"those who live by the sword will die by the sword\". Kate Swann [WH Smith] has been vitriolic about the previous management. So far, Stuart Rose has been careful not to talk.' </p> <p>Whittaker should know. His company, Reputations Inc, represents retailers including Mulcahy, Holmes and Mason. </p> <p>A source close to M&amp;S last week bewailed the attention given to the departure of an accessories buyer. 'What other company would get headlines over something like that?' they asked. </p> <p>David Southwell, communications chief at the British Retail Consortium, says it is because few other businesses touch lives so obviously and so often. </p> <p>'Being a retailer is like being a football manager, only worse. Every customer, like every fan, has an opinion. A shop, like a team, can go down as well as up and, just as a football manager is only as good as his last game, a retailer today is judged on the latest sales figures. At least football managers usually get a season to turn a team around.' </p> <p>It makes you wonder why anybody would want to head a retail business in the public arena. Why work in a goldfish bowl like M&amp;S or Sainsbury's, with so much information on show for your critics and competitors alike to pore over, if you can be a Philip Green, choosing within reason what you share and what you hold closer to your chest? </p> <p>One well-known chief executive says he has told his children to avoid the public arena at all costs should they choose to follow him into business. On the other hand, Steven Marks, founder of French Connection, told the Barclays retail conference this month that he enjoys running a public company, but then his is doing relatively well. \"Retail is the most competitive business environment,' says Southwell. 'People interact daily with retailers and are interested in what they do. Everybody thinks they understand retail because they shop.' </p> <p>On Tuesday Justin King becomes the latest chief executive of a once-great high-street icon to outline a rescue plan, following hard on the heels of Swann at WH Smith. Analysts expect him to say more about the state of the distribution system (which King said is failing despite the fact that Sir Peter Davis spent hundreds of millions on modernisation); more about streamlining range; more about price positioning and more about customer service. </p> <p>No one expects a rabbit out of the hat or anything that can make any real difference in the short term to the former number one supermarket's sliding market share. </p> <p>'There will be a number of points about good housekeeping,' predicts Simon Proctor of Charles Stanley. 'Given the disastrous position they are in now, it is difficult to see him making much difference.' His view is widely shared. </p> <p>Last week Swann had to attempt the same at WH Smith, another once-great business that had to slash its dividend almost in half as profits tumble and sales struggle. </p> <p>At Boots, King's great friend and former Asda colleague Richard Baker last week jettisoned the final piece of baggage inherited from Russell's ill-fated reign when he sold the laser eye and dentistry venture. </p> <p>The daddy of all recoveries, however, has been promised by Rose at M&amp;S. Of all the newcomers, he has perhaps been the most careful not to trash the names of his predecessors. </p> <p>At all of them the plea is the same: 'Give me time to show this business is not bust'. The similarities go on. At Sainsbury's, Boots and WH Smith the newcomers have warned that, as Swann put it last Thursday, 'there are no quick fixes'. She said it will take at least three years to improve operating margins. </p> <p>Swann, King and Baker have cautioned that as promotional activity is streamlined, sales will be hit in the short term. When Baker arrived at Boots, for example, he was horrified to find no fewer than 30 kinds of special deals eating into profit margins... Swann was only the latest to highlight this. </p> <p>'We are no longer prepared to buy sales at the expense of profits,' she said, pointing to the axing of the 'two hardbacks for \u00a320' deal. </p> <p>They have all 'kitchen-sinked' - in other words, dumped all their bad news into the public domain - at the earliest possible moment. Swann and King have done so with candour, openly pointing to the failures of the preceding management. </p> <p>Baker and Rose have let their actions do most of the talking. Hundreds of jobs have gone at Boots as Baker has closed down new ventures started by Russell. Rose has cleared out management, starting with Radice and working his way down through the ranks, while also shutting the Lifestore homeware experiment. </p> <p>Will they succeed? Shareholding institutions and analysts estimate that Rose has until Christmas 2005 to prove he can mend M&amp;S. Swann will certainly have a hard time if this Christmas, the first she can be held accountable for, is a bad one, although soundings among institutions suggest that she may yet get the three-year breathing space she wants. </p> <p>The pressure on Baker appears to be less heavy than any of the others, while his friend King at Sainsbury's is, reportedly, on the shortest rein of all. Analysts, many of whom have been downgrading busily since the latest profits warning, are pessimistic. The JP Morgan team wrote on Friday: 'We forecast short-term pain and insufficient long-term operating margin upside in the UK.' </p> <p>Lord Kalms, writing in the latest edition of Retail Week, thinks that as far as Sainsbury's is concerned the future is gloomy: 'If I was in the crystal ball-gazing business, my guess is they will be swallowed up at some stage.' </p> <p>But that is another story. For the moment King, like his counterparts, can only reiterate: 'Trust me, I'm a retailer'. </p> <p><strong>...but haven't we heard that somewhere before?</strong></p> <p>ANOTHER WEEK, another retail recovery strategy. The problem is, it's hardly the first time we've heard one. So the question is: should we believe the newcomers? </p> <p>Take this statement from WH Smith: 'This has been a year of considerable challenges for the group, with our businesses delivering mixed results. Ongoing tough trading, following a rather lacklustre Christmas, resulted in a profits decrease at WH Smith UK Retail.' </p> <p>And this: 'Flat sales over the period, combined with a decline in margin and an increasing cost base, resulted in very poor results over the key Christmas trading period.' </p> <p>The first was Richard Handover, then chief executive, in the 2003 annual report; the second was Kate Swann in the 2004 edition. </p> <p>Handover highlighted WH Smith's 'concept store' in Guildford as a test-bed for strategies that would 'ensure that we retain our position as one of Britain's best-known high street brands'. He said: 'Future success will be based on a more thorough, practical understanding of shifts in customer motivation, buying habits, expectations and attitudes.' </p> <p>A year later, Swann said: 'We are taking immediate action to address these issues and to reinstate the basic operational standards needed to meet the challenges that lie ahead.' </p> <p>While Handover pinned his hopes on Guildford, now internally acknowledged to have been a less than successful experiment, Sir Peter Davis over at Sainsbury's was setting store by a new IT system. </p> <p>'Challenge' is a favourite word at Sainsbury's, too. Davis, before his premature retirement, wrote: 'This has been a challenging year for us. I said last year that it was the year of real change ... I am disappointed that the results weren't better. </p> <p>'The sheer amount of change in the business clearly distracted us from delivering as good a service as we should. However, we can now start to put that behind us and concentrate much more on the customer and trading the business harder.' </p> <p>There have been two profits warnings since then. Expect to hear King use the words 'challenge' and 'challenging' on Tuesday. </p> <p>Back in May, just before Philip Green announced his intention to own M&amp;S and sparked a revolution in Baker Street, then chief executive Roger Holmes was acknowledging that buying had been poor, ranges were wrong and there was too much bureaucracy. 'We are clearly under pressure to perform,' he said, adding: 'We have a lot to do but I am confident we can succeed.' </p> <p>Stuart Rose could say the same about the situation he finds himself in. </p> <p>Perhaps the last word, however, should go to Luc Vandevelde, the man who spent four years trying to turn M&amp;S around, initiated what turned out to be a false dawn and then finally fled to the relative safety of private equity. </p> <p>He described the media interest in M&amp;S as 'almost intolerable' and said that running a FTSE 100 company today was becoming less and less attractive. 'This is one of the most visible jobs to do,' he said. 'You have to have a pretty strong stomach.</p>",
  "<p>ONCE the Iraq conflict had abated in the summer of 2003, given a fair wind and a touch of luck it looked as though the world's economy might start to gather momentum. Expectations were enormous; GDP predictions for the US were spectacular, culminating in most global bourses bounding on as if there was no limit as to how far they could climb. But apart from small rallies in January and September, economic chickens were coming home to roost, thus dashing enthusiasm. It looks as if growth had been dramatically exaggerated, particularly in Europe and Japan. </p> <p>General Motors' poor results and redundancy plans for its European workforce, mainly in Germany and possibly the UK, has highlighted the problems that the motor industry, which is fundamental to social wellbeing in the West, may have to face in the months to come. Germany currently sports a 10.7 per cent unemployment rate and France 9.9 per cent. With that kind of unemployment, new cars become a luxury rather than an essential. Competition from Japan and North America is fierce. Margins for manufacturers are constantly being eroded and foreign exchange vagaries seriously affect their profitability. </p> <p>Labour costs in Japan are significantly lower than they are in Europe. General Motors has seen the light. Will the other motor companies be forced into making similar cuts? </p> <p>Should investors avoid the luxury sector or will skillful managements of the motor companies attend to the housekeeping necessary to stay ahead of the game in what is becoming a ridiculously competitive marketplace?

  "<p>THAT Rupert Murdoch was planning to move his print operations out of Fortress Wapping was one of the worst-kept secrets in the industry. But now the details of News International's \u00a3600 million investment in new presses have been made public, executives have a clearer idea about the future of the British newspaper market. It may not be a rosy one for rival groups. </p> <p>For one thing, Murdoch's huge investment in new technology lays to rest any doubt about his long-term commitment to his British papers. Some Murdoch-watchers have questioned whether he had the will to stay in one of the world's toughest newspaper markets, despite the political clout it gives him, now that News Corp's television interests in the UK and America make up the vast majority of his global media empire. </p> <p>That now looks like wishful thinking. Murdoch has leap-frogged the opposition by spending hugely on new technology that could give his papers a competitive advantage, even if it is unclear how he will meet the cost of the investment. News International insists the project will be self-funding over three years, but the Times is losing money and the Sunday Times, the Sun and News of the World are thought to generate around \u00a3120m a year, far less than is needed to fund such a huge investment programme. </p> <p>The sale of parts of Wapping to property developers could meet some of the cost, but the entire site may have to be auctioned off. Some observers estimate it could be worth up to \u00a31 billion. A site at Enfield, within spitting distance of the M25, will become News International's publishing and distribution hub in the south east. New equipment will also be installed at Liverpool and Glasgow. </p> <p>The 22 German-built presses Murdoch has ordered have two huge advantages over existing technology. They are far faster and will print in full colour. Speed is vital for News International, which prints an average of 3.5 million newspapers every night. The new presses print four times as quickly, which means Murdoch's editors will have later deadlines. That has obvious advantages for newspapers competing with each other - and with 24-hour news channels and the internet. Crucially, it also means more localised editorial can be inserted. Providing up-to-date sports coverage tailored to regional tastes can be particularly difficult, but later deadlines will help to overcome that problem. </p> <p>'Football is a huge circulation driver,' says one industry executive. 'Later deadlines will mean it's possible to get more football coverage in the regions. Outside London, some European games don't make the papers at all because they finish so late'. </p> <p>More significantly, the new presses will be configured to produce up to 120-pages of full colour, a quantum leap that advertisers have been demanding for years. 'We are moving towards a full-colour world,' News International chief executive Les Hinton said last week. </p> <p>Maureen Duffy, chief executive of the Newspaper Marketing Agency, which was set up by owners to sell the benefits of newspaper advertising to big business, says colour is paramount for advertisers. 'Full colour in newspapers will help the industry to attract more advertising revenue. Many newspapers will tell you that at certain times of year they have already sold out of colour pages'. </p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP, recently echoed Duffy's comments at a gathering of newspaper executives. Most companies currently use the print media to trumpet a new product launch or publicise a summer sale. Expensive, brand-defining advertising campaigns typically appear on TV. That could change when full colour arrives, according to Sorrell. The amount of money spent annually on colour advertising outstripped that spent on mono pages for the first time last year, according to the Newspaper Marketing Agency (\u00a3821m compared with \u00a3598m) and its growth over the last five years has been phenomenal. In 1999, \u00a3405m went on colour and \u00a3664m on black and white. </p> <p>The Print Industry Research Associa tion estimates that the newspaper advertising market will grow by 2.4 per cent by 2006, but demand for black-and-white adverts will stagnate. Growth will come entirely from colour ads, it predicts, which will grow by 5.9 per cent. As mono pages are phased out, the premium newspapers charge for colour pages may diminish, but it will still remain higher than the price paid for mono pages. </p> <p>If News International transfers production to its new presses inside three years, its newspapers will be amongst the only ones to offer full-colour advertising on every page. The Guardian Media Group, which owns The Observer and its daily sister title, will print both in full colour once they move to a new 'Berliner' format. But of the other groups, only Daily Mail owner DMGT has kept pace, investing heavily in its Harmsworth Quay site in east London. It has been trailing a 64-page full-colour edition of the Evening Standard since May. </p> <p>Much of DMGT's innovation was driven by Murdoch MacLennan, until recently managing director of Associated Newspapers, but now chief executive of Telegraph newspapers. One of the first challenges he faces now that he is in situ at the Telegraph is how to respond to the gauntlet thrown down by Murdoch. The Telegraph has already reached an agreement with Express proprietor Richard Desmond over their joint ownership of the giant West Ferry print plant, but he may feel that it needs to be upgraded before the existing contract to print the Telegraph titles expires in 2009. </p> <p>When Murdoch last moved his papers nearly a generation ago, he did so secretly. The subsequent battle with the print unions caused a social and political upheaval that will not be repeated this time. Although up to two-thirds of the Wapping work force are likely to lose their jobs, the print unions have not been recognised at Wapping since the last bitter industrial dispute ended. </p> <p>The Wapping years may also be drawing to a complete close. Although News International says it will not be moving, there is little to keep it in east London, on land with huge potential redevelopment value. Leasing several floors in the City - or perhaps even Fleet Street - may ultimately make more commercial sense.</p>",
  "<p>FIVE years ago, I had a conversation with a friend of mine - a very eminent scholar who specialises in international relations. He looks like someone out of central casting - grey hair, an absent-minded bearing, with a penchant for elegant but crumpled corduroy suits. He has an acute sense of history, and often seems to view everything from an altitude of 30,000 feet. We were talking about the internet, and the challenge it represented to the established order. I had outlined what I saw as the amazing potential of the network to transform access to information, make it impossible for governments and media establishments to hush up scandals, undermine established corporations, create new kinds of businesses which had hitherto been inconceivable, etc, etc - in short, to change the world. </p> <p>My friend courteously heard me out. Then he said: 'Well, we'll see. Perhaps this technology is indeed a revolutionary threat to the established order. But I wouldn't bet on it.' </p> <p>Five years on, I'm not so sure I would bet on it either. Consider this report from Thursday's Guardian. 'Last week, Rackspace, a [web] hosting company with headquarters in Texas, handed two of its London-based servers to the FBI after a subpoena for their contents was issued by a US district court. The servers contained material belonging to the Independent Media Centre - better known as Indymedia (<a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org)\">www.indymedia.org)</a> - a conglomeration of global radical anti-globalisation sites produced by ordinary citizens.' </p> <p>Now one of the interesting things about Indymedia is that much of its content is produced by amateurs - what it calls 'citizen journalists'. Its Internet Service Provider, Rackspace, said it was merely complying with a court order 'which establishes procedures for countries to assist each other in investigations such as international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering'. Indymedia has been unable to find out why its material has been seized and its sites disabled. Is it because, somewhere in its web pages, there are genuinely sinister things? Or just material that someone - the Attorney-General of the United States, for example - doesn't like? In the Kafkaesque world bequeathed to us by Osama bin Laden and his opponents, we simply don't know. </p> <p>The moral of the Indymedia story is that, when push comes to shove with the established order, the internet usually blinks first. While in principle the net provides the most unfettered and uncensored communications medium in history, in practice it has a critical weak link - the fact that in order to access the net, everyone has to go through an ISP. And ISPs are, for the most part, commercial companies - organisations owned by shareholders and run by accountants and lawyers who tend to see the upholding of liberty and free speech as loss-making activities best avoided. What this means is that the moment a threatening letter arrives, they tend to take down the site 'just to be on the safe side'. </p> <p>And usually they do this without examining whether the complaint has even superficial validity. You think I jest? Well, consider the findings of an experiment conducted recently by an activist group called 'Bits of Freedom'. They signed up with 10 Dutch ISPs and then put online a work by a famous Dutch author, Multatuli, who died more than 100 years ago. The online versions stated that the work was in the public domain. The group then set up a fake society which claimed to be the copyright holder of the work and sent out complaints to all 10 ISPs using a Hotmail address, demanding that they take down this 'copyrighted' material. Seven out of ten removed the site - one within just three hours. One ISP forwarded all the personal details of the site owner to the sender of the fake takedown notice without even being asked to do so. Only one ISP pointed out that the copyright on the work had expired many years ago. Or, to put it another way, only one of the 10 ISPs bothered to look at the supposedly offending material. </p> <p>The moral is clear. If you want to censor someone, just get your lawyer to write a snotty letter to the ISP that hosts his or her site. More generally, those of us who worry about freedom will have to address the issue of ISPs. There may be a case, for example, for NGOs across the world to band together to set up an ISP which would be prepared to investigate and vigorously contest complaints and injunctions from the established order. The days when we could assume that we could 'publish and be damned' on the net are over. </p> <p> <strong> john.naughton@observer.co.uk <a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/\">www.briefhistory.com/</a> footnotes/ </strong></p>",
  "<p>CAPITAL markets can save the planet from global warming - and earn billions for financial institutions at the same time. That, at least, is what a growing army of City enthusiasts say about carbon emissions trading, the new way of making money from environmental restrictions. </p> <p>Banks and brokerages are piling in to trade in 'pollution permits', an increasingly prized commodity as regulation tightens. Gas-guzzling industrial corporations will soon be scrambling to buy these credits, and with the launch of a formal European-wide emissions market in the New Year, the international community of 'carbon brokers' is about to come of age. </p> <p>Permits equal to 1 million tonnes of carbon emissions were bought and sold in September alone, a twentyfold increase since the beginning of the year, according to consultancy Point Carbon. Russia's recent declaration that it will ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change is sure to boost the market further, as will alarming headlines that last week suggested global warming has begun to accelerate rapidly. </p> <p>Emissions trading is one of those unusual 'big ideas' that can claim a measure of support from environmentalists, businessmen and politicians alike. It follows a series of initiatives, usually led by the European Union, to reduce the amounts of carbon released into the atmosphere by factories, power plants, steel mills and even commercial office blocks. </p> <p>The plan is for big companies to be given an 'allowance' of carbon they can emit. If a company exceeds its permitted pollution quota, it will face a fine. If, however, it beats its allotted target, it can sell on the remainder of its allowance to other firms, which use it to extend theirs. </p> <p>From a government standpoint, the aim is to control - and gradually reduce - total industrial emissions while making it as easy as possible for the private sector to fall into line. </p> <p>Currently, emissions trading is based on swapping carbon credits at a future date. The EU scheme does not take effect until January and thousands of companies have not yet even been given their allocations yet. But there is little doubt in the Square Mile that emissions trading could be a very profitable branch of the commodities market. </p> <p>The likes of Barclays Capital and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein have been building their environmental markets teams, presumably in the expectation that carbon quota prices will go up. Cantor Fitzgerald, ICAP and a number of specialist boutiques, as well as the likes of Shell and BP, are also involved. </p> <p>London's International Petroleum Exchange is aiming to become the hub of global trading, on the basis of the City's experience of buying and selling emissions futures so far. It is also about to start trading in a range of new carbon derivatives. But volumes are sure to increase hugely once EU quotas become a reality, and several financial centres - not least the Chicago Climate Exchange, which has also run a carbon trading system, and the New York Mercantile Exchange - are considered just as likely to inherit the leading role. </p> <p>Russia's decision to move towards ratification of Kyoto is important because the treaty needed another big country's support to become legally binding. Controversially, the US has refused to sign up to the protocol, despite being the world's largest polluter, responsible for 20 per cent of all carbon emissions. </p> <p>However, the political will to combat global warming is increasingly there, not least from Tony Blair, who has described it as 'the most serious long-term threat facing the planet'. Britain plans to cut its emissions by 20 per cent by the end of this decade as its contribution to both Kyoto and additional EU efforts. </p> <p>The plan imposes particularly big cuts on electricity generators and coal-fired power stations and will be difficult to implement. The CBI, naturally, is not happy, warning that the government's targets risk 'sacrificing UK jobs on the altar of green credentials'. </p> <p>Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, has said it is impossible for his company to cut its fuel consumption, fines or not. Business leaders also point out that no comparable obligations have been imposed on household emissions and cars, which together account for as much pollution as the industrial sector. </p> <p>In other words, carbon emissions will remain unpredictable and difficult to control with any precision, a point underlined by the fact that, to the government's dismay, emissions actually rose in 2003, a consequence of economic growth being 'higher than forecast'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, some environmentalists fear that tradeable permits will actually delay the day when some of the wealthier smokestack companies finally recognise the need to clean up their operations. They also predict that some will simply relocate offshore, to countries beyond the reach of EU fines. </p> <p>Alternatively, it is possible that the fines will not be punitive enough. The current price of carbon futures - equivalent to \u20ac10-\u20ac15 per tonne - has been rising sharply of late, but whether that proves sufficiently expensive to force big polluters to change their behaviour remains to be seen. </p> <p>After fierce lobbying, EU governments have shied away from imposing heavier fines on its industries, especially as their American competitors face no such obligations. Besides, energy and power firms can do what they always do - pass on their fines to the customers. If the EU scheme fails, it could mean even higher gas and electricity prices for us all.</p>",
  "<p>IN A WEEK when McDonald's launched a new campaign, replacing its golden arches symbol with a question mark, it seemed appropriate to ask: what is the future for brands and branding? </p> <p>At Cass Business School, as part of the Cass Creatives initiative, a panel of brand practitioners joined in debate over 'So logo: branding in the 21st century'. </p> <p>Rita Clifton, chairman of Interbrand, was clear that 'brands have a future. Indeed businesses need to recognise that branding is central to their future development, the organising principle for any kind of business. Brands represent something like 70 per cent of market capitalisation, a value that is increasingly identified but that generally becomes apparent only when companies change hands. </p> <p>'This means,' she said, 'that businesses need to manage this prime asset more rigorously than any other. And the brands that we know well have succeeded because they have managed to do that over a long period of time. </p> <p>'Companies like Coca-Cola have been developing their brands for over a century, and the vast majority of the biggest brands are veterans of the business world. </p> <p>'In 19 out of 22 product categories, the company that owned the leading brand in 1925 still has it today - Nabisco, Kellogg's, Kodak, Del Monte, Wrigleys, Singer, Campbell's and Gillette among them. Yet brands survive because they have a quality of restlessness - they are not content to stay the same but they seek innovation, they evolve and sometimes they change radically.' </p> <p>Most of them are American, too. Simon Anholt, author of the newly published Brand America (Cyan Books), argued that US brands dominate just about every category. 'American brands have supported, and drawn support from, Brand America. But is there a change in the air?' </p> <p>Anholt was in no doubt that America is not just a country, but a brand - and one that is now in trouble. </p> <p>'Its aspirational values of liberty and wealth, created by the nation's founding fathers and sustained by commercial, political and cultural interests, no longer have their former strength,' Anholt said. 'Recent US foreign policy has brought about a high level of scepticism, even antagonism. America could be at the tipping point where its dominance could no longer be taken for granted. In particular Asian brands could be the brands of the future.' </p> <p>Anholt explored the development of country-of-origin brands, starting with the way the label 'made in Japan' had been transformed in just 30 years from junk to desirable, 'even to the extent that Dixon's own-label brand Matsui has been designed to sound Japanese'. </p> <p>He said that 'other Asian countries are now developing branding expertise on the basis of a growing manufacturing stranglehold. None more so than China'. </p> <p>He cited the example of Haier, a Chinese business-to-business refrigeration company, now world leader. 'With a third of the world's people living in China, it was just a matter of time and inevitable economic development for Chinese brands to become as famous as Coca-Cola.' </p> <p>Tony McGuinness (combining brand consulting with being a leading DJ) put his leather imitation Prada bag on display - stylish, beautifully made and bought for \u00a315 in Shanghai. Coming from the music industry, which is in the forefront of the piracy debate, McGuinness's attitude was that brilliant imitation was legitimate and a sign that brands can be empty constructs. 'Nike don't make American clothes, they make Chinese, so why not buy Asian fakes rather than pay extra for the authentic label?' he asked. </p> <p>But Interbrand's Clifton said 'theft still had to be labelled theft - and, indeed, such imitation demonstrates the power of the brand'. </p> <p>Martin Lee, who runs Acacia Avenue, a brand research consultancy, argued that great brands have 'authenticity of intent'. He and others in the audience had doubts about the example put forward by McGuinness, American Apparel. 'Ethical issues matter, particularly when authenticity is claimed. For authenticity to be deeper than a promotional claim, brands cannot be solely the preserve of the marketing department,' Lee argued. </p> <p>'If brands succeed, they build collective expertise that reaches into every area of the business.' </p> <p>That expertise, he said, means developing an ability to be local as well as global - hence Coca-Cola's evolution from a monolithic brand to a business that owns more than 400 local brands. </p> <p>The audience of business school students, alumni and practitioners added to the diversity of the debate - sometimes with a show of hands, more often with questions and comments. Others contributed after the event itself, with Rishi Dastidar insisting that 'a brand can help to deliver a business strategy, but it is no replacement for a business strategy'. Peter Bonnici argued for greater rigour in the use of the brand word. </p> <p>Perhaps there was no consensus about a future for brands in the 21st century. But everyone agreed that branding is an issue that now affects every company. And not just every company - every organisation, personality, and geographical entity, too. Branding is the 21st-century issue. </p> <p><strong>John Simmons (www. thewriter.co.uk) is series editor of 'Great Brand Stories' and author of 'My Sister's a Barista' published by Cyan Books . </strong></p>",
  "<p>We commented here yesterday on China Wonder - an example of the eastern frenzy gripping small company speculators in London. But while China as an investment growth story is so clearly in the news, it would be wrong to ignore the sub-continent, another area where investors' expectations are perhaps getting somewhat ahead of reality. </p> <p>Take Asia Energy, a company floated on AIM in April with a view to conducting \"feasibility studies on coal resources within the republic of Bangladesh\". </p> <p>Fringe broker W H Ireland raised \u00a311.2m at 72p a share, giving an initial total market capitalisation of \u00a325m. </p> <p>The stock sat just above the placing price until last month, when the company suddenly announced the discovery of a \"world-class black bituminous coal seam 41.47 metres in thickness\". </p> <p>A follow up statement declared: \"Based on a 15m-tonne per annum coal operation, the cash-flow analyses ... indicate an average ungeared, post-tax project net present value (NPV) of $2.3bn using a discount rate of 10% and an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 50%. Coal production could start as early as 2007 with start-up capital to the second year of production of approximately $530m.\" </p> <p>Barclays Capital arrived as financial adviser and prospective lender. </p> <p>Lots more drilling is now under way and the share price responded with a move from 80p to 335p in a matter of days. Just recently it has come off the boil, falling 8.5p to 289p yesterday. But the company still commands a market capitalisation of \u00a3115m - for an open cast coal mine, where the prospectus notes that the resource will be extracted with \"truck and shovel\". </p> <p>There can be no doubt that Bangladesh would benefit from the development of its natural resources and projects such as this tend to attract all sorts of help from multinational bodies. It is nevertheless eye-catching that Asia Energy should suddenly appear on the London market during the biggest mining rush in over a decade and then hit a huge strike within months of listing. </p> <p>An old London market rule says that the further the assets are from the Square Mile, the higher the discount. Novice investors playing this stock should take note of that. </p> <p><strong>Kingsize job</strong><br> </p> <p>Next week Justin King, the man who has inherited the appalling debacle known as J Sainsbury will take to his feet to explain how he intends to steer the ailing chain out of the very deep mire in which it finds itself. Several measures are expected - the dividend will probably be halved and action taken to get goods on the shelves (the odds of finding what you want on the shelves being only marginally better than winning the lottery). </p> <p>He will probably pour millions into cutting prices and announce a recruitment drive to get staff into stores. At the same time many of those beavering away in the chain's overly swanky glass HQ in central London are expected to be receiving their P45s, PDQ. </p> <p>We expect a new focus (another one) on quality food at competitive prices. Witness the new TV adverts in which Jamie Oliver (presumably seen as too down market, darling) is seen being taught about quality by \"a Michelin-starred chef\". </p> <p>The head office may go, as might the home ranges and possibly some of the stores, in sale and leaseback deals. </p> <p>So what can Mr King bring that will possibly be a pleasant and impressive surprise? Passion. Commitment. Belief. That's right. Stuff that oozes leadership, ambition, persuasion and ability. Without it, frankly, he will be toast within a year. </p> <p>We suggest a little weekend coaching from Jude Law. </p> <p><strong>Bear necessities</strong><br> </p> <p>Dollar bears have plenty to chew on these days. Most of the evidence, from industrial output to the oil price and uncertainties over the presidential election, suggests that the economy may be running out of steam. </p> <p>But the core of the bear case is not the slower-than-expected pace in the increase in US interest rates which would cut yields on dollar denominated assets. Put crudely it is the belief that at some point foreign investors will simply lose their appetite for funding the trade gap and stop buying dollar assets. No one quite knows when it might happen but the bears are convinced it will. So if foreign investors give up on dollar assets what will they buy instead? The yen hardly looks attractive. Foreign exchange speculators have plenty of relatively recent experience about what the Bank of Japan is prepared to do to keep the currency at a level which encourages the country's exporters. </p> <p>Sterling would hardly be the market's darling in a dollar bloodbath as both the trade balance and the government deficit are beginning to acquire a distinctly American twang. The Swiss franc has its friends but it is hardly in unlimited supply. </p> <p>That leaves the euro,- tagged as a symbol of a sclerotic economy badly in need of US style economic reform. </p> <p>The eurozone is changing, albeit slowly but is hardly a model for those who believe in the market, the whole market and nothing but the market. Yet for dollar bears there may be little choice.</p>",
  "<p>The US Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, yesterday warned that the world economy could be in trouble if oil rises much further but said current prices should not inflict the damage that previous oil spikes have. His comments came as prices touched $55 a barrel. </p> <p>\"The impact of the current surge in oil prices, though noticeable, is likely to prove less consequential to economic growth and inflation than in the 1970s,\" Mr Greenspan said in a speech in Washington.</p> <p>\"The risk of more serious negative consequences would intensify if oil prices were to move materially higher,\" he warned. The fact that the Fed chief gave a whole speech over to oil prices reflects growing concern among global economic policymakers about the 65% increase in prices so far this year.</p> <p>Yesterday US light crude futures reached a record $55 a barrel before settling at $54.90, up 2 cents from Thursday's $54.88.</p> <p>Most analysts think oil has not finished rising yet as the strongest demand for a quarter of a century has stretched world oil production to the limit. Gulf of Mexico production is still not back to normal after Hurricane Ivan and the US looks short of heating oil leading up to winter.</p> <p>\"Crude prices are almost single-handedly going higher,\" said Edward Meir, an analyst at Man Energy.</p> <p>Mr Greenspan said that over the long term, gains in technology and market forces were likely to ensure the world had an adequate supply of oil as it makes an eventual transition to other energy sources.</p> <p>Separately, data showed American consumers unbowed by the rising cost of oil or the uncertainty about who might win the presidential election.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, international economist at consultants Capital Economics, said consumer spending for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than the 1.6% annualised growth in the second quarter.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, consumption growth in the fourth quar ter is more likely to resemble the second rather than the third, as higher oil prices begin to bite,\" he said.</p> <p>The strong numbers pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 38 points to 9,933.38, but currency markets sold the dollar against the euro, fearing that strong consumer spending would exacerbate the country's already enormous trade deficit by sucking in more imports.</p> <p>Other figures, however, showed that not all parts of the US economy were doing well. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly this month while industrial production rose a paltry 0.1% in September.</p>",

For that, she was not looked upon favourably by the [government],\" it said.</p> <p>Her award was also seen as a triumph for women. \"She was the first woman to get a PhD not only in Kenya but in east and central Africa as well,\" said Debra Sanaipei in the <b> Daily Nation </b> . \"She was also the first woman to head a university department in Kenya. Now, she has done Kenya and Africa proud by winning the Nobel peace prize ... The African women salute you.\"</p> <p>Papers outside Kenya also offered their congratulations. But Zimbabwe's <b> Daily News</b> thought President Mwai Kibaki might face \"pressure from the male chauvinist pigs in his cabinet not to reward Prof Maathai for her distinction ... fearing that her own ambition might soar even higher - the presidency of the country.\" He should ignore them, it said, and give Prof Maathai \"every encouragement. She has demonstrated over the years that she can do any man's job.\"</p> <p>Prof Maathai would not sacrifice her principles for her political career anyway, reckoned the Daily Nation. \"Only last week, she threatened to quit her Tetu parliamentary seat if that would help to stop the plunder of Kenya's forests.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1792 Henry Walton Smith opened a small newsvendor business with his wife, Anna, in Little Grosvenor Street, London. In 1849, with the support of the local Methodist community, John Boot opened the British and American Botanic Establishment at 8 Goose Gate, Nottingham. In 1869 John James and Mary Ann Sainsbury opened a small dairy shop in Drury Lane, one of the poorest areas in London. In 1884 Michael Marks, a Russian born Polish refugee opened a stall at Kirkgate market in Leeds. What followed was an astonishing success story as these family-owned companies (now known as WH Smith, Boots, Sainsburys, and Marks &amp; Spencer) built themselves up into large corporations with iconic household names as the leaders and role models in their fields. One could add, though it has not been family owned, the National Freehold Land and Building Society, formed in 1849 and now known as Abbey National, which has been in the headlines this week for selling its troubled business to a Spanish corporation against the wishes of angry small shareholders. What these companies have in common is that they have all been in the news recently but, sadly, not on account of their proud history but because, if they are not careful, they may be consigned to history. </p> <p>As Britain changes from a nation of shopkeepers to a nation of price-conscious consumers, nostalgia no longer commands a premium. Shoppers these days will get their cheap purchases of commoditised goods - including the latest best-selling book as well as food - from the likes of Tesco and their serious books from dedicated shops like Waterstone, complete with their own coffee shops. This leaves retailers like WH Smith caught in the middle, everyone's second choice for practically everything except newspapers and magazines. </p> <p>Sainsbury, M&amp;S and Boots similarly find themselves wilting between the huge purchasing power of the giant supermarkets, the large discounts on the internet, and the premium pull of the branded merchandise. Tesco's buying power is scary enough for the traditional shops and supermarkets but that of Wal-Mart, the US multinational that owns Asda, is awesome. Goldman Sachs reported this week that in California, despite price-cutting by its rivals, Wal-Mart was over 15% cheaper for food and even more so for non-food items. This is because of the capacity of its global purchasing policies to grind down prices and costs in supplying countries. Smaller competitors simply can't match it unless they are prepared to make losses. </p> <p>In the end, the decline of the famous family shops is our fault. As consumers we prefer a one-stop shopping approach for most of our needs leaving our specialist purchases for upmarket outlets thereby creating a black hole in the middle. Such spending habits perfectly suit busy 21st century lifestyles and help produce a virtuous spiral for the giant supermarkets in which increased sales keep prices down by spreading costs across a wider base. </p> <p>The good news is that globalised competition has virtually eliminated inflation. During the most recent 12 months the price of food contracted by 0.7% and the price of clothing plummeted by almost 6%. That means we have more in our pockets to spend on other things - though in the longer term if serious deflation sets in it could threaten a recession as consumers may keep postponing their purchases - as happened in Japan - in the hope of ever lower prices later on. In these unwelcome circumstances shops such as Boots, Smiths, M&amp;S and Sainsbury may have to re-invent themselves to stay in the game as major players. They have wonderful histories but, sadly for them, history doesn't move product these days. Nostalgia has a surprisingly short shelf life.</p>",
  "<b>San Francisco Chronicle</b> <br> Debra Saunders, October 14 <br> \"The anti-war crowd was right that national leaders' decisions on what to do about Iraq were based on oil and greed - they were just wrong about which countries' leaders. According to the new Iraq Survey Group [ISG] study... Saddam Hussein systematically bribed or greased the palms of officials and businessmen from countries that are permanent members of the UN security council - France, Russia and China - with the goal of undermining the UN sanctions. Not only did that strategy work, but Saddam's corruption of the oil-for-food programme also bankrolled his lethal projects... <p>\"Countries corrupted by Saddam... called for an end to the UN sanctions as the sanctions led to more suffering among the Iraqi people. With pockets bulging, leaders in these countries did the bidding of the one man who caused the suffering.\"</p> <p><b>Scotsman</b><br> Editorial, October 15<br> \"The secretary general of the UN, Kofi Annan, was [on Thursday] forced to agree a \u00a317m budget to investigate widespread allegations that UN officials were bribed by Saddam through the agency's discredited oil-for-food programme... Now other disturbing findings are emerging from the ISG investigations - that Saddam, with the connivance of UN officials, used the oil-for-food programme to finance foreign terrorist groups, including the notorious Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]...</p> <p>\"Much has gone wrong since Saddam was deposed. But equally, those who favoured a continuation of sanctions as an alternative to regime change must explain how they would have stopped Saddam funding the PFLP...[or] bribing UN officials to get his murderous way.\" </p> <p><b>Washington Times</b><br> Helle Dale, October 13<br> \"Opponents of the war always seem to assume that had we not invaded Iraq, Saddam would have been content with the status quo... That, however, would have been totally out of character ... </p> <p>\"Saddam bought support, particularly among French, Russian and Chinese officials... Recipients even included Benon Sevan, the [former] head of the oil-for-food programme, and other officials in charge of humanitarian relief. The scandal has gone all the way to the top, to Mr Annan's son himself. Needless to say, the countries that benefited most... were also the countries that were most adamantly opposed to the Iraq invasion. Those who criticise the military action taken by President George Bush and his team should say what they would have done in the face of the outrageous bluff attempted by Saddam.\"</p> <p><b>Toronto Star, October 12</b><br> Stephen Handelman<br> \"The [ISG] findings will... put a heavy burden on all UN member states to re-examine sanctions policy. Sanctions can be some of the most effective instruments short of war to weaken unjust or 'rogue' governments. But only if they are enforced transparently. If we believe in them, we should do everything possible to ensure that they are never abused so blatantly again. That means pursuing criminal penalties against those who did so in Iraq.</p> <p>\"'Knowledge of your opponent's weakness is a weapon in itself,' Saddam told his captors. The few weapons Saddam actually possessed were in the end his most effective: the duplicity, greed and dishonesty of the global community.\"</p> <p><b>Moscow Times</b> Editorial, October 15<br> \"By helping undermine the UN sanctions against Iraq, Russia has weakened the credibility of the UN itself. Why should anyone listen to Moscow the next time it says, 'Let's take this to the UN?'... The apparent hypocrisy is impressive. According to the report, the [Russian] foreign ministry itself was receiving oil vouchers from Saddam.</p> <p>\"Russia can take some steps to repair the damage. It can open an investigation into Russians' involvement in the oil-for-food programme, support the UN's own investigation by providing full information, and take punitive measures against those who are found to have violated the sanctions. But it probably will not. The Putin administration has made a practice... of using the judicial system as a political tool against its enemies. There is little reason to believe that it would now turn this weapon on itself.\"</p> <p><b>New York Times</b><br> Editorial, October 14<br> \"The emerging scandal is already under multiple investigations in [the US], in Iraq and at the UN. But nothing that has surfaced so far suggests that the sanctions were failing in their main purpose, that the Bush administration's precipitous invasion was necessary or that the UN is fatally hobbled by corruption or incompetence...</p> <p>\"Saddam managed to sell oil outside the programme... He also managed to import some conventional arms and components. None of these imports were related to nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The sanctions, backed by the presence of weapons inspectors, did their main job...</p> <p>\"The UN security council members ought to conduct their own investigations... It's important to track down any corruption so future international efforts have the highest level of confidence. At the same time, however, everyone needs to remember that on the most critical count, sanctions worked.\"</p>",
  "Driving down Michigan Avenue in Dearborn a woman in a chador takes her hand off the steering wheel of her SUV to light a Marlboro. Through the half-open window she exhales smoke and Lebanese pop music. As she turns into Dunkin' Donuts her bumper reveals a frayed sticker: Vote Kerry/Edwards. <p>Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit, is the hub of Arab America. When the car plants of the Motor City had attracted all the labour they could from African-Americans fleeing tyranny and poverty in the deep south, they went for those fleeing poverty and war from the global south.</p> <p>And just as African-Americans brought gospel and turned it into Motown, so Arab-Americans are blending the culture of the old country with that of their new home.</p> <p>You will find more Arab-Americans in California and New York, but you will not find a greater concentration of them than here. One in three people in Dearborn is of Arab origin; Detroit is the biggest Iraqi city outside Iraq.</p> <p>It is by no means typical. \"Unlike anywhere else in America, you could live your whole life in Dearborn in an Arab-American bubble,\" says Jennifer Salan of the Arab American Institute (AAI).</p> <p>But, where electoral politics are concerned, it is important. The latest tracking poll shows the Democrats leading by four percentage points in the swing state of Michigan; Arab-Americans comprise 5% of the state's vote.</p> <p>By luck rather than design Arab-Americans are a sizeable force in many swing states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. In a third of the states needed to win the electoral college, Arab-Americans make up more than the gaps between the two parties.</p> <p>What is more they are up for grabs. In 2000 they backed George Bush. This year they are leaning half-heartedly towards his Democratic challenger, John Kerry. In a close race which will be decided in just a few places, Arab-Americans are a rare and precious phenomenon: a swing constituency in several swing states.</p> <p>\"In an election this close any small group makes a difference and this is one of them,\" says James Zogby, the head of the AAI. \"The way the polls look now will represent about 200,000 votes going from Republican to Democrat. What a party loses in one place they have to pick up somewhere else.\"</p> <p>\"It's not a community that any party has a lock on,\" says Ismael Ahmed, the executive director of Access, the biggest Arab-American social services agency in the country, which is based in Dearborn. \"Especially a community like this one where 60% weren't born here. We're not really committed to either party.\"</p> <p>And so it was that the Arab American Political Action Committee (Aapac) endorsed Mr Bush in 2000, leftwing campaigner Dennis Kucinich in the Democratic primaries, and Mr Kerry for president.</p> <p>\"We were motivated when we backed Bush and we are motivated now,\" says Osama Sablini, Aapac's chairman and publisher of the Arab American newspaper, who backed Mr Bush four years ago. \"The Bush administration has been a major disappointment to this community and we cannot afford four more years of this.\"</p> <p>To understand their initial enthusiasm for Mr Bush we must go back to the presidential debate in St Louis four years ago, when Mr Bush opposed the profiling of Arab-Americans. \"Arab-Americans are racially profiled on what's called secret evidence,\" he said. \"People are stopped. And we've got to do something about that.\" That was \"not the American way\", he said.</p> <p>\"You have to ask yourself why it took such a small thing to secure our votes,\" says Jumana Judeh, vice-chair of the Arab American Chamber of Commerce, who wanted to endorse Al Gore in 2000.</p> <p>\"Someone recognised our votes. Someone noticed us. We're the new kid on the block and the new kid is going to get kicked around the block until they stick up for themselves and then people move on to someone else.\"</p> <p>Add to that the fact that Mr Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, was pro-Israel, and the Republicans looked to many like the best bet.</p> <p>\"A lot were opposed because he was so pro-Israel and then some were against him because he was Jewish and they thought he couldn't see beyond that,\" says Ms Judeh. </p> <p>On polling day Mr Bush beat Mr Gore by 45% to 38% while the independent candidate, Ralph Nader (who is of Lebanese descent), received 13%.</p> <p>Then came September 11. While none of the hijackers had American citizenship and Dearborn is home to few Saudis, the community felt besieged. Under Mr Bush not only profiling, but detentions, investigations and deportations became the American way for Arab-Americans. </p> <p>\"We were targeted in our houses, in our bank accounts, in charities and in our in our mosques,\" says Zouhair Abdelhak, a Democrat supporter who owns a jewellery shop.</p> <p>\"It was a total sea change,\" says Mr Ahmed. \"It raised us from below the radar to a focused-on group and put us literally physically at risk. Hate crimes went up five-fold. At the same time we went to war with Afghanistan and Iraq. And we were told that this is a war without end. All of that makes Arab-Americans feel at risk.\"</p> <p>With a sizeable proportion of Iraqi Shias in the the community, there was a split over removing Saddam Hussein by force. But those rifts have been mended by opposition to the manner in which the occupation has been handled.</p> <p>Accusing Mr Bush of betrayal, the Arab- American community started shopping around for another candidate.</p> <p>Most backed Howard Dean in the Democratic primaries. When Mr Kerry emerged the winner they went with him.</p> <p>Initially they were enthusiastic. A poll of Arab-Americans by the AAI taken in Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania in July showed Mr Kerry leading Mr Bush by 54% to 24% with Mr Nader on 13%. By last month Mr Kerry's lead had almost halved, down from 30 points to 18, with a large number of undecideds. Some fear Mr Kerry could slide even further.</p> <p>\"There will be a ceiling for the president,\" says Mr Zogby. \"And I think he's reached it. The question is do the rest vote for Kerry or not vote at all. Many of those in the undecided or even in the Nader category would switch to the Democrats, but have not yet found a reason to do so.\" </p> <p><b>Disappointed</b><br> </p> <p>On Saturday, when the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, came to Detroit, Ms Judeh went to the gym. Earlier in the week, during the vice- presidential debate, Mr Edwards was asked: \"What would your administration do to try to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\" </p> <p>Mr Edwards said: \"First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves. What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists?\"</p> <p>In a week in which Israel launched its bloodiest incursion into Gaza in four years, he did not mention Palestine once. \"After I heard that I thought I'm not going to go out and cheer for him,\" says Ms Judeh, who attended the Democratic national convention this year.</p> <p>\"I was a loyal Democrat. I distributed the tickets. But I wasn't going to go. We don't expect them to be pro-Palestinian. But they won't even say 'We support a just peace in the Middle East'.\"</p> <p>So while there is much loathing for Mr Bush, there is little love, as yet, for Mr Kerry.</p> <p>\"They are not giving us anything to work with at a grassroots level,\" says Fay Beydoun, who runs the AAI's branch in Michigan. \"People are very anti-Bush but we need to motivate them to go out and vote for Kerry and Edwards and they don't make it easy.\"</p> <p>In a community where alienation from the mainstream is pervasive, Republicans tell a similar story, particularly with regard to the Middle East and civil liberties.</p> <p>\"We disagree with the administration on them not dealing with the Palestinian leadership,\" says Jawad Allawi, a Republican businessman. \"You shouldn't give the other side a passport to kill people because those people have a bad leader... But I don't think any administration in the last 50 years has been even-handed in the region.\"</p> <p>Muhannad Haimour, who works for Access and recently founded a newspaper, Forum and Link, believes the community should have held out for more concrete promises before giving its endorsement. \"The community should have said, 'No you are not going to take our vote for granted'. If we have to throw our votes away then so be it. Instead, we're just going to just give our votes to them. If I vote at all I will vote for Nader as a protest,\" he says.</p> <p>An hour later he is challenged as to what he will do if wakes up to find Mr Bush has won by one vote.</p> <p>\"Well, I know, in the end I will vote for Kerry. I won't want to. Until the day of the election I will protest.</p> <p>\"But when I get into the booth I think I will have to because the prospect of four more years of Bush is more than we can take.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the surface there is little to commend Larry David. He'll obsess about his clothes and men who wear thongs on the beach. He'll arrange to play golf with his manager on his wife's birthday, wrongly accuse fellow passengers of stealing his airline tickets and even smuggle the head of a stolen doll down the front of his trousers to appease the daughter of an important television executive. On top of that, he's a compulsive liar worth $600m.</p> <p>But at a time when the British public finds itself short of genuine American heroes, this balding, disaster-prone, Brooklyn-born neurotic has emerged as the unlikeliest of saviours. Curb Your Enthusiasm, about David's cosseted LA life as the co-creator of Seinfeld, depicts a man at war with the world, yet prepared to own up to his many faults.</p> <p>In episodes past he has been variously branded a \"four-eyed fuck\", \"a self-hating Jew\" and \"a pool of wrong\", not to mention a misogynist. Gloriously glum, he is a curmudgeon, the bearer of a torch passed on by Woody Allen, Homer Simpson and Hank Hill. He rails against the foibles of polite society while finding a way to insult almost everyone he comes into contact with.</p> <p>David insists that the Larry David we see in the show is an exaggeration of the real thing - albeit someone he'd enjoy being in real life. On the recent evidence of a public dispute with an architecture magazine that ran a feature on his home in Martha's Vineyard, the divide between the real and fictional Larry is becoming increasingly blurred. He insists he will use the spat as the basis for a new episode.</p> <p>\"The show hugely exaggerates things,\" insists Jeff Garlin, who plays the repugnant if loyal Jeff Greene, of his famously media-shy colleague. \"In real life Larry's a real good guy. I'm about to enter my fifth year working with him. If he was like he is in the show in real life, there's no way I could do that.\"</p> <p>If the premise of CYE - Larry's life, Larry's friends, Larry's issues - sounds knowing to the point of self-indulgent, that's because it is. In real life, David is the failed bra salesman turned frustrated stand-up comedian, infamous in comedy circles for walking off stage. He happily admits scouting New York for places to doss if he hit bottom.</p> <p>After an unproductive year writing for Saturday Night Live he hooked up with old pal Jerry Seinfeld in the late 1980s and together they co-created and wrote the seminal US comedy \"about nothing\", Seinfeld. You might be forgiven for thinking that the fame and fortune from a global sensation would have cured Larry David of his melancholy, but you would be wrong.</p> <p>A recurring theme of the show, which starts filming on a fifth series in January 2005, is Larry's fretting about the minutiae of life. He worries about his pants forming a \"tent\" when he sits down, the heating at his aunt's funeral and whether his friend's grandfather did actually invent the Cobb salad.</p> <p>When Alan Partridge does this sort of thing it's because he's essentially an empty man with nothing else to occupy him. With Larry David, however, you feel that this rubbish really concerns him. Somehow it's comforting to know that a great home, whopping bank balance and a gorgeous, tolerant younger wife doesn't always add up to an easy life.</p> <p>Like its comic peers, Seinfeld and The Office, CYE scores with its realism, but unlike both it is unscripted. David prepares an eight-page plot outline and the actors are then required to improvise their dialogue. Multiple takes are filmed on handheld cameras. David and his team of executive editors then piece the best bits together and let the complex plots unfold to a now familiar Italian circus soundtrack. The results are consistently spectacular, compelling you to view unfolding disasters through the gaps in your fingers while tubas fart in the background.</p> <p>Curb Your Enthusiasm shines an unforgiving light on a vacuous world populated by characters such as Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (George and Elaine from Seinfeld), Ted Danson and Rob Reiner, who all play versions of themselves. By season four, which has just finished its run in the States, Martin Scorsese, Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer and Mel Brooks have also joined the fray.</p> <p>Art is made to imitate life and vice versa. In season two, we find David pitching an idea for a show about an actor who finds it hard to get work because they are so identified with their character from a hit comedy. Spotters will know that Jason Alexander's character in Seinfeld, the stooge George Costanza, is largely based on the real Larry David.</p> <p>After a petty row with Jason Alexander, Larry takes the idea to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who loves it. She is keen to pitch the idea to HBO, but her hopes are dashed when first Larry accuses the HBO president of stealing his prawns after a mix-up at the Chinese takeaway and then insults another HBO executive by calling him \"a cunt\" during a friendly game of poker. </p> <p>Their last remaining hope of getting a commission is extinguished when Larry traumatises the daughter of a key executive at ABC by cutting the hair off her prize doll. It is this belter of an episode in which Larry and his manager Jeff (alongside wife Cheryl, the only other main character played by an actor) are rumbled in the process of burgling the house of Jeff's estranged wife, played by the brilliantly foul-mouthed Susie Essman.</p> <p>\"I guess I'm a pretty likable guy,\" says Garlin, asked whether there's any resemblance to his character. \"Jeff Greene does some pretty horrible stuff. It would be fair to say that Larry and Jeff's friendship has survived against the odds. There are no lines that cannot be crossed. As you will see in future seasons there are some things that if I pulled them on anybody else, they'd say, 'Get the fuck away from me'.\"</p> <p>The genesis of the show could have been lifted from one of David's story outlines. He and Garlin were renting offices in the same Santa Monica block and one day, post Seinfeld, David invited Garlin to lunch. \"He was asking me questions about stand-up comedy and I told him that if he wanted to do an HBO special I had the perfect idea,\" explains Garlin, who had previously produced specials for comedians Denis Leary and Jon Stewart.</p> <p>The result was the hour-long HBO special, Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, written by David and first screened in the US in 1999. Essentially a mockumentary about the making of an HBO special, it follows Larry as he prepares to make a comeback in stand-up. Forty shows and 20 hours of classic comedy later, David and Garlin, also an executive producer on Curb, continue to lunch both on screen and off.</p> <p>Going out on cable (HBO) has undoubtedly allowed David to trespass into areas restricted on mainstream American TV - even to the extent of poking fun at his paymasters. Politically incorrect gags about the disabled, racial minorities and the Holocaust, plus musings on topics as diverse as children getting drunk and incest survivor groups, ensure that the humour is rarely less than reassuringly dark.</p> <p>David recently wrote an open letter to John Kerry, offering his services as a vice-presidential running mate. In it he suggested \"whatever qualities Bush has that people find appealing... I have those same qualities in spades\". This from a man who caused a religious war at the baptism of his wife's sister's Jewish fianc\u00e9e, from someone who Mel Brooks describes in the final episode filmed to date as \"a storm that will destroy everything in its path\".</p> <p>Although he might hate me for saying it, I still believe Larry David is a man capable of restoring our faith in America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Curb Your Enthusiasm - The Complete Second Series is out on DVD on Monday. Season three is showing on E4</p>",
  "<p>After an entire summer spent dealing with the issue of family catering by slinging bread, cheese and a bit of salad on the table, and attempting to pass it off as a proper meal, I concede, now the nights are drawing in, that perhaps it's time to re-establish some sort of working relationship with the cooker. Apart from anything else, my saucepans have cobwebs in them. It's probably the biggest hint yet that I should call a halt to this pitiful domestic slacking and knuckle down to producing some decent hot dinners. </p> <p>What a bore. In my experience, properly cooked meals, if they are to be at all edible and/or nutritionally balanced, demand forethought, lengthy columns of five ingredients or more and a flair for timing, sauce consistency and seasoning. Even the simplest dishes seem to require basic accessorising, some sort of garnish and an instinctive knowledge of what to do with giblets, a white-wine reduction and pastry crust. </p> <p>I count none of these among my natural gifts, despite the fact that everything about my kitchen bellows accomplished cook. If I didn't know otherwise, I'd say that Mrs Beeton herself had been the previous incumbent, dreaming up junkets and suet puddings on an Aga the size of a small family saloon, backed up by a great many businesslike work surfaces and shelves heaving with recipe books. But the truth is, I feel like an impostor in this gloriously clich\u00e9d rural tableau. I possess not one iota of natural flair for cooking. In a former existence, I was surely an under-nourished drop-out in a bedsit with nothing but a solitary milk pan and single gas ring for company. </p> <p>I am a little ashamed to admit that I have in my repertoire just five hot \"dishes\". I hesitate to call them dishes, because the description suggests a certain elevated position on the culinary scale. Instead, I suspect my winter-long rotation of spaghetti bolognese, chicken curry, macaroni cheese, roast chicken and lasagne fall squarely into the perfunctory meal category. I am horribly aware that they gain me precisely no points for imagination, experimentation or effort. I don't care how many times Nigel Slater trumpets the notion of simple, warming fare, I am bored, my family is bored. I have reached such a stage of culinary paranoia that I feel the Aga is shooting me reproachful glances. My utensils are mocking me. I am not getting the best out of them and they deserve to be stretched. </p> <p>Of course, it is for just this kind of inertia that cookery books exist, and I certainly have plenty of those. From Gary Rhodes to Rick Stein, Nigella Lawson to Mary Berry, if ever inspiration were required, I have it in spades. But proof of my aversion lies in the unusually pristine state of my recipe library. Dedicated, habitual cooks leave the marks of their toil; in my books, you won't find telltale spatterings of coulis and red wine jus besmirching their pages. There is, too, a shameful absence of stuck-together chapters soiled with the sweat of producing sauce hollandaise and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Lack of confidence, fear of failure and, perhaps, plain idleness prevent me from spattering vanilla custard with wild abandon. There have been, in the past, occasional flurries of courage, but more often than not they have ended in disappointment: Jamie Oliver's fish pie - rubbish; ditto the dried-out depth-charge that was meant to be his meltingly moist chocolate cake. After each crushing blow to my already fragile self-esteem, I went scurrying to Delia Smith's Complete Illustrated Cookery Course - the Janet and John of easily-digested cooking literature - like a bullied and harangued child back to its mother. As a result, I don't know why I'm even bothering to look at Gordon Ramsay's eye-wateringly complex recipe for roast skate with beetroot and parmesan. </p> <p>It's a complete waste of time, too, studying the pages of the Ivy cookbook and, in particular, an interesting-sounding truffled mixed artichokes with corn salad and herbs. Futile in the extreme is the time I am spending leafing through the Moro cookbook, slavering over things like manteca colorada (pork rillettes to you), because there isn't a chance in hell of any of it appearing on the menu of a dinner party catered by me. </p> <p>All in all, I suspect I conform to the universal truth that the more recipe books a person owns, the less they actually cook. I am well aware that this probably puts me in the very highest category of food-porn offenders. I hold up my hands as a culinary pervert, a domestic dirty mac, a furtive fumbler with a stash of material to challenge that of the lustiest teenager, but who is resigned to looking, dreaming and fantasising, but never actually attaining. </p> <p>Can this be at all healthy? Surely it's the sort of attitude that turns solitary, socially inept pornography users into rabid women-haters and people like me into the sort of disturbed individuals who sneer at provocative sachets of juniper berries, take long detours in Waitrose to avoid the exotic seasonings aisle, and develop irrational loathings of hard-to-obtain ingredients such as black cod and banana leaves. Clearly, I have a problem, and I'm not sure even Delia can help this time.</p>",
  "<p>This occurred to me at this press conference in Ethiopia, where Bob Geldof said Poul Nielson (EU commissioner; yes, funny way to spell Paul) was talking out of his arse. (I was there, you know. Never mind why.) This sent a ripple around the room that, if you were imagining it, you'd call amusement (Pop Star Swears In Formal Environment chuckle), but in actual fact was more like delight. </p> <p>The thing is, everybody swears in normal life. All public figures of all sorts, apart from priests and Tony Benn, curse like navvies, from the coming of the dawn, when their egg is overdone, till the going down of the sun, when there isn't enough ice in their gin and tonic. I don't know that in a factual way, but I'm as sure of it as I've ever been of anything in my life. It might just be light cussing, even as mild as sod, but still, there it is, like the chug of an engine, proof that they're awake. And yet, even the least quick-witted among them, even the ones who can't remember what they were supposed to say, or what they said last week, or any answer to any simple question, can still remember to excise even the blandest profanities from their speech. They think it makes them sound respectable and adult, the cuss-free prose, but actually it just makes them sound not fully human.</p>",
  "<p>The way IBM and Microsoft got together over the IBM PC is being raked over for the three billionth time in \"They Made America, a serious coffee table history book by renowned author and former newspaper editor Harold Evans,\" according to a story from <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_43/b3905109_mz063.htm\">Business Week Online</a>.</p> <p>BWO says: \"Evans' book falls short of clarifying exactly how Kildall lost out to Gates. He relies primarily on Kildall's memoir, his family, and his friends. Evans says he requested an interview with Gates, which he says Microsoft denied. He didn't make contact with IBM or Paterson, but tapped previously published accounts for that side of the story. IBM would not talk to BusinessWeek for this article, but former IBMers take issue with Kildall's version of events. Microsoft calls the book 'one-sided and inaccurate,' and says the company is proud of the 'foundational role' it played in the industry. Paterson denies he stole Kildall's intellectual property. He says he's stunned that the authors failed to get in touch with him. 'You'd think they might have asked. I'm not hard to find,' he says.\"</p> <p>The BWO story points out that Killdall's memoir -- written just before he died --does not tally either with IBM's version (from people who were there) or Kildall's lawyer's version (who was also there). It obvously doesn't agree with earlier histories that conclude that Digital Research didn't get the PC deal because Kildall wasn't there at all.</p> <p>Even if Kildall had been there, he wouldn't have done the deal: his wife Dorothy dealt with hardware suppliers. As ex-DR employee (and ex-boss of Symantec) Gordon Eubanks recalls <a href=\"http://www.maxframe.com/EUBANKS.HTM\">here</a>: \"Gary was very laid-back. He didn't care that much. Dorothy ran the business and he ran the technical side and they did not get on.\"</p> <p>In any case, the idea that Kildall could have been Bill Gates is ludicrous. Even if Kildall had got the deal, he wasn't remotely capable of doing what Gates did, which was systematically convert a lucky break into a dominant position in desktop software. He was a nice guy, and all that, but from a business point of view, Kildall didn't have a clue.</p> <p>DR was finally finished off, as a serious market force, by Apple, which sued (or threated to sue) DR over the similarity of its GEM graphical environment manager to the Macintosh. Whatever the merits of the case, DR didn't have the resources to fight, and crippled the PC version of GEM to get Apple off its back. Since GEM was vastly better than Windows at the time, this was ultimately a big help to Microsoft. Bet that's not in the book.</p>",
  "<p>Driving over farm tracks to his isolated Cheshire home, Alan Garner suddenly hauls his car off the path and bumps over a field of stubble to the top of a small rise. \"It's clear enough so you can see them both,\" he says pointing to the horizon. \"There's my first book and there's my most recent.\" A domed hill in the foreground, he explains, is the western ridge of the valley of Thursbitch, the setting and title of his latest novel, which is published in paperback this month. The flatter hill apparently beyond, but actually closer, is Alderley Edge, his \"bone country\", and the predominant setting of his 1960 debut, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen. </p> <p>In fact, virtually all Garner's writing features, in one way or another, the land visible from this field. This microscopically attentive study of the region comes with a deeply-felt appreciation of its cultural history, which has won him many admirers. But it is in combining this almost claustrophobic sense of place with a prodigiously expansive handling of time that has given his work its instantly identifiable tone. </p> <p>And it is not just in Garner's work that the past, present and future meld. His home, Toad Hole, was a medieval manor house to which he has added a 500-year-old timber-framed Tudor medicine house, removed and rebuilt beam by beam from a site 20 miles away. But long before the manor house existed, this was a significant stone-age burial site - a jawbone turned up under the kitchen floor and Mesolithic flints have been found in the garden. Flattened musket rounds found also indicate an English civil war skirmish on the same site and the sense of cohabiting timescales is made complete by the startling sight of the huge white bowls of the Jodrell Bank telescope just a few yards away. </p> <p>Garner and his wife, the educationalist and critic Griselda Greaves, have been meticulous in maintaining and documenting the site. Some years ago, he was assisting in the archaeological excavation of a culvert in the garden, which found evidence in the form of organic material that would indicate a flooded, post-ice-age landscape of 7,000 or 8,000 years ago. Garner commented to one of the diggers, \"I've looked so far back in time I've got whiplash.\" It is a sensation that many of his readers will recognise. </p> <p>The critic and writer Neil Philip, in the most comprehensive study of Garner's work, A Fine Anger (1981), wrote that time was Garner's most constant theme: \"sequential, causal, 'historical' time is set against and enlarged by a 'mythological' concept of time as elastic, cyclic, recoverable\". Philip went on to note that \"myth is the crucible in which Garner's thinking about time has been fired\". </p> <p>Garner has made potent use of universal, national, and most of all, local myth and history. Francis Spufford, in his memoir of childhood reading, The Child that Books Built (2002), praises Garner's achievement in \"reintroducing myth into the bloodstream of daily life\". He saw Garner as part of an amazing generation of talent at work as the 1960s ended and in the 1970s, citing William Mayne, Peter Dickinson, Jill Paton Walsh, Joan Aiken, Diana Wynne-Jones, Rosemary Sutcliffe and Leon Garfield. </p> <p>Throughout his career Garner has been the object of almost universal critical respect and is still widely regarded as a touchstone when discussing children's literature. AS Byatt recently used him as a stick with which to beat JK Rowling. In reading writers like Garner, Byatt wrote, \"we feel we are being put back in touch with earlier parts of our culture, when supernatural and inhuman creatures - from whom we thought we learned our sense of good and evil - inhabited a world we did not feel we controlled\". </p> <p>Others have argued that it is misleading to describe Garner as a fantasy author. Professor Richard Morris, director of the Institute for Medieval Studies at the University of Leeds, is the archaeologist in charge of the Garner site. He has known Garner for 30 years, composed the music for a Garner libretto and they are working together on a book about the house. </p> <p>\"He actually creates hardly any original material,\" says Morris. \"Most of the names are real people and most of these stories have been lying around. What he does is to find things, rearrange them and put them together. His creativity lies in making connections which haven't previously been articulated. Likewise as a finder and assembler, sometimes of the simplest words, he is a genius. It is quite inappropriate to compare him to, say CS Lewis or Tolkien because he doesn't deal in fantasy, his is the real stuff of his part of England. The materials in his stories are authentic, not fabricated. Maybe this is why his later books have taken so long. He has had to prowl around to find these connections.\" </p> <p>Thursbitch, his meshing of the stories of John Turner, local packman who trafficked goods in and out of Cheshire and froze to death in the valley in 1755, and contemporary walkers Ian and Sal, was started in 1972. His previous book, Strandloper (1996), about Cheshire bricklayer William Buckley who was transported to Australia and lived as a holy man among aboriginal people for 33 years before returning home, took 12 years to complete. The closing scene, in which the returned Buckley \"dances\", bushman-style, over the topography of Cheshire, is deeply moving. \"I'm a sniper,\" says Garner. \"I will sit in the bush for as long as it takes to get that shot away. If I had to write a paragraph in 15 minutes or be hung, then I would be hung. But if anybody or anything gets in the way of the writing it's like saying to someone who is pregnant and the waters have broken that there is a good film on television. I have been fairly good at prioritising since I was a child. I think my single-mindedness is innate.\" </p> <p>Garner was born in Cheshire on October 17 1934. His 70th birthday tomorrow will be a cause of private celebration but, he says, \"I live in such a remarkable environment, both architectural and archaeological, that 70 years doesn't really figure. I just don't inhabit that type of timescale.\" He was brought up in and around the village of Alderley Edge and his early childhood was blighted by illness. Twice his parents were told that he would not survive. </p> <p>It was during a period in an isolation hospital suffering from meningitis, combined with whooping cough and measles, that Garner recalls teaching himself to read. \"I think Edgar Rice Burroughs must have had a similar experience,\" he says. \"Tarzan is described as seeing the letters on a page as little bugs and then realising that the little bugs fitted together. That was so close to my own experience. I then became a literary gourmand. I just stuffed myself with books.\" </p> <p>At infant school a teacher tried to \"cure\" his left-handedness by strapping his arm across his chest. \"It was catastrophic. Instead of becoming ambidextrous like most left-handers do, I couldn't use either hand and it caused a severe speech impediment.\" He also remembers having his mouth washed out with soap by a teacher for speaking \"broad\" in the Cheshire dialect used by his family. </p> <p>He admits to being \"an oddball\" at school and discovered he was a natural athlete who would later be an international standard junior sprinter by \"getting out of the school gates before the others. But I don't blame the other children. I wasn't there most of the time and when I did turn up I was getting twice as many marks as them. I once remember making the whole room boil when I was about eight and spent a lesson drawing a section through a volcano in multicoloured chalks. In the end my teacher would ask me only to put up my hand if I didn't know the answer.\" </p> <p>Harold Smith, who became an upholstery teacher, was a primary-school contemporary and remembers the young Garner as \"a bit precocious. There were about six or eight of us who were a little gang and he was always the ideas man behind things. He had ideas that no one else had and was quite charismatic and a bit of an exhibitionist, although as he got older he became more of a loner.\" </p> <p>Garner won a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School and says he suffered from the \"classic grammar-school syndrome that has perhaps been over-documented. It was like a portcullis coming down. A friend's mother told me I wouldn't want to speak to them any more. And while my family was initially pleased, they didn't realise that getting an education is not like getting a car. The child expands and the family cannot cope.\" </p> <p>Garner's father was a house painter from a family of local craftsmen. He describes his mother's side of the family as full of \"cranks and anomalies and sparky people. My maternal grandfather was both the original and the destructive mind. In the early 1900s he was a senior reporter on the Yorkshire Post, which was no mean feat. He ended up as a nightwatchman at the Hovis factory in Macclesfield.\" Garner, who suffers from manic depression - \"actually a psychosis and better called bi-polar disorder\" - suspects his grandfather was similarly afflicted. </p> <p>As the first member of his family to receive a formal secondary education, he says the phrase that sticks in his mind with the greatest anguish was members of the family saying \"you are only trying to make me look a fool\". \"I learned the hard way that there wasn't much point in rushing home and becoming excited about irregular verbs. But my [paternal] grandfather, who was a triple smith - blacksmith, whitesmith and locksmith - never said this. He gave me the wonderful advice, 'if the other fellow can do it, let him'. What he was saying was 'find out what is in you and don't let other people say otherwise', and that has been the single conscious driving force in my life. It haunts me and justifies me.\" </p> <p>At Manchester Grammar School - where a children's library is now named after him - Garner was an exceptional athlete, but when a national coach told him he could be the first British sprinter to reach an Olympic semi-final, he immediately gave up. \"If there were 15 other people who could do what I was doing, what was the point? It was back to my grandfather again and I was quite happy to let the other fellow do it. Although I must say it was worth being a good athlete just to get through basic training when I did national service. I was fine when it crucified most people.\" </p> <p>Garner did not write at school although a pastiche of The Waste Land - \"I thought it was a con because any poem that needs notes has not been properly worked. Perhaps I'd be a little less dismissive now, but I don't withdraw all of it\" - made it into the school magazine. He was a gifted linguist and at one time had a reading knowledge of 12 languages. \"For a time I could absorb any language like a sponge but I still don't understand why I had to learn so many. Was I unconsciously rejecting my real language?\" asks Garner, who has increasingly incorporated his local dialect into his books and says that even as a young man he never consciously despised or rebelled against his roots. \"It just so happened that every step forward was away from there.\" </p> <p>After school Garner did national service as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery before taking up a place at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read Classics. Although he was active in drama societies he still wasn't writing. \"There were lots of people saying they were going to write and they just embarrassed me.\" Former Conservative minister Kenneth, now Lord, Baker was assistant stage manager for a production of Antony and Cleopatra in which Garner played Antony, his wife to be Ann Cook was Cleopatra and Dudley Moore played Enobarbus. \"Alan was a very good actor and nice man,\" recalls Baker. \"I remember him having this personal theory about the dark lady of Shakespeare' s sonnets coming from Cheshire. He was very dogged defending it against all comers. And he wrote a diary in Egyptian hieroglyphics.\" </p> <p>In Oxford Garner once found himself in the same room as Tolkien and CS Lewis, with whom he would later be compared. \"I heard Tolkien say that modern English is not a vehicle capable of writing prose,\" he remembers. He says he arrived at Oxford \"assuming\" he was on an escalator that would lead to a chair in Greek but soon lost all enthusiasm. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew it wasn't what I was doing. Then I remembered this essay about the artist as the last free spirit and, with a total lack of logic, thought as I was good at languages I could therefore write.\" A \"Damascus-road moment\" came when sitting on a tree stump at home looking at a wall built by his great-great-grandfather. \"And I knew I had to do something that was as well done as that wall. As a writer I had to be true to that wall. When I went back to Oxford it had become a cold and irrelevant place for me.\" </p> <p>Despite his determination to leave, Garner expected his tutor to persuade him to stay. \"But instead he said I was an obsessional perfectionist to the point of self-destruction and if I didn't get a double first I would destroy myself and do nothing with my life. And if I tried to get my double first and write a book I would do neither. So we had a gentleman's agreement and he said, and this is verbatim because there are some things you just don't forget, 'go down now and discover whether you have an original mind. If you find out that you have not, you may come back to this place and spend the rest of your life reading the works of those who have'.\" </p> <p>Garner left Oxford aged 22 in 1956 but returns later this month for an Alan Garner Day staged by the Bodleian Library to mark its official receipt of his papers. Richard Ovenden, Keeper of Special Col lections &amp; Western Manuscripts at the library, says: \"We probably have the greatest collection of children's literature and Alan Garner's papers are a wonderful addition.\" Ovenden praises the comprehensiveness of his papers. \"He obviously thinks in an archival way which is apt for someone so interested in how the past affects the present. And he is enormously enthusiastic about his collection being available for study. Sometimes literary figures can be more concerned about their manuscripts as valuable assets rather than research materials, but that is not the case with Alan.\" </p> <p>Garner returned to Cheshire and in September 1956 began work on what would become The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, his magical story of holidaying children Colin and Susan coming into contact with the legend of the wizard of Alderley Edge. By this time he had married his first wife, Ann Cook, whom he had met in Oxford. They had three children; Ellen, Adam and Katharine. In 1961 Garner met Griselda. They married in 1972 and have a son, Joseph, and daughter, Elizabeth, who published her first novel, Nightdancing, last year. \"Instinctively we have never discussed anything about writing and Elizabeth has still not read Thursbitch ,\" Garner says. </p> <p>Soon after returning from Oxford, Garner saw a for sale sign outside his current home, then divided into two cottages. The price of \u00a3510 was beyond his reach, but his father, who had been contributing to a penny-a-week saving scheme, unexpectedly and without much comment, loaned him the money. Such is the architectural and archaeological value of the site that the Garners have established an educational trust to take over the property after their deaths. </p> <p>Richard Morris says that \"their management of the site has been highly sensitive and almost unique in that virtually every artefact that has come from the garden, no matter how apparently trivial, has been retained. And by not modernising the house they have ensured that it is there to speak to the future. They should get some sort of recognition because it is a conservation dream and the trust is an enormously generous gesture.\" Garner says, \"It is now so valuable that it would have to be sold for death duties, and the only people who could afford it are the people I've been protecting it from all these years.\" </p> <p>Linked to the work at the house is a multi-disciplinary project led by Manchester University focusing on Alderley Edge. \"There are 20 disciplines,\" says Garner, \"but the oral archive is the jewel in the crown and I'm proud that that couldn't have got off the ground without me. That is something the other fellow just couldn't have done.\" </p> <p>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen was published in 1960 to immediate acclaim, with the local bookshop selling 500 hardback copies in the first week. The 1963 sequel, The Moon of Gomrath, was also well received. Despite his status and success, throughout his career Garner has had a reputation for tetchiness about his work being called \"children's literature\". There are picture books such The Little Red Hen (1997) - his biggest public lending rights earner - that clearly fall into this category. But when he left Oxford to write he did not anticipate producing something so attractive to younger readers as The Weirdstone of Brisingamen . \"I do not write for children,\" he once explained in an essay, \"but for myself. Adolescents read my books. By adolescence, I mean an arbitrary age somewhere between 10 and 18. This group of people is the most important of all.\" </p> <p>Neil Philip suggests that it is Garner's \"unwillingness to make any statement before he is ready to do so, before he has reduced his ideas to their simplest, their essential form,\" that makes his work appealing to this group. </p> <p>In the early 60s Garner combined writing with some part-time television presenting and in 1965 published Elidor, in which three children are drawn back into a dying world through the portal of a dilapidated Manchester house. It consolidated his commercial and critical reputation and in 1967 The Owl Service, the only non-Cheshire based novel, which drew on Welsh folk-tales of the Mabinogion, won the Carnegie Medal and Guardian children's book award. </p> <p>However, during the filming of The Owl Service for television in 1969, Garner suffered a mental collapse. \"In the process of film-making, time is fragmented and the autobiographical bits of the story, of which I am never aware at the time of writing, felt as if they had cut loose like a detached retina. Something from 1949 would be crashing into something from 1952 and then crashing into 1960. I had no temporal awareness and in the middle of a conversation with someone I'd suddenly not know who they were and become concerned that I'd be late for school unless I stopped talking.\" </p> <p>Several sessions with a psychiatrist got him back to work but there were periodic episodes over the years until, in 1980, he says, \"it was as if the lights were turned down and I lost all sense of worth\". He remembers listening to Benjamin Britten's Serenade for tenor and horn. \"I had to leave the room because I thought it would kill me. For two years I spent 12 hours a day lying on the settle in the kitchen, and the other 12 hours in bed. How my family survived I do not know. The only people who connected with me were Joseph and Elizabeth, who were infants, and they acted like animals and stroked the back of my neck. After two years it went quicker than any aspirin could shift a headache and I thought what on earth was all that about?\" </p> <p>He was, eventually, diagnosed with manic depression and prescribed lithium although he now takes no medication. \"Lithium is a pretty brutal poison and you have to get it spot on. And nearly all writers, who are vastly over-represented among sufferers, who have been treated with it, eventually refuse to take it because nothing seems to matter, whether good or ill. They seem to need the lows and the highs in order to write.\" </p> <p>Garner's 1973 novel, Red Shift, was a major departure. It took six years to write and intricately meshed three present-tense narrative threads set among Romans in Britain, the English civil war and contemporary Cheshire. The TLS called it \"probably the most difficult book ever published on a children's list\"; another reviewer claimed it was a \"bad attack of gimmicky self-indulgence brought on by over-praise\". But the book was also hailed as a masterpiece and, 20 years on, is seen as the precursor to both Strandloper and Thursbitch . </p> <p>Linda Davies was Garner's publisher at the time. \"He was already a big noise when I joined and part of my job was to keep Alan Garner on the list,\" she recalls. \"There was a big debate whether to publish Red Shift as a children's book because our salespeople didn't understand it at all, but I was stunned that a children's book could provide something so flexible and intriguing.\" </p> <p>Garner subsequently agreed to produce next a recognisable children's book but the four-volume Stone Book Quartet, published from 1976-80, was not quite what his publisher was expecting. Science fiction author Brian Aldiss called his reworking of the craft tradition in his father's family and the generational rites of passage it spawned as \"beyond all making\". Garner's prose is reduced to a deeply satisfying simplicity that nevertheless yields almost endlessly layered readings and Garner identifies the quartet as the work he has been happiest with. </p> <p>\"The thing that keeps me writing is that the next time I will get what I saw and then I can stop,\" he says. \"Good for me is having the smallest possible gap between what I could have written and what I ended up with. I've never got what I wanted but the Stone Book Quartet came very close. There are parts of Thursbitch that I don't know where they came from, but it somehow resolves parts of my own life in a way that I don't understand.\" </p> <p>Both Strandloper and Thursbitch, like Red Shift before them, have been described as \"difficult\" reads. Neil Philip says: \"The opening page of Strandloper is almost incomprehensible and you have to be willing to trust the flow of words. It seems like a deliberate attempt to shake off people who aren't willing to put in the effort. But if he could make it easier he probably would.\" Philip goes on to explain that in many ways the books work more like poetry than as novels. \"There is the greatest possible range of meaning in the fewest possible words. What Alan is really interested in is folding his language in on itself to make a collapsible universe where everything is dense with meaning.\" </p> <p>As to whether there is any overriding theme or purpose to what he writes, Garner says that, consciously, his purpose is to \"finish the book and be quit of it, because it is stimulating, exhausting, wholly demanding and relentless, and not a little frightening\". But one image he comes up with is that of a goods train, with each book a wagon. \"The theme, whatever that may turn out to be when there are no more wagons to attach, is that all are being moved in the same direction by the engine (me or what drives me), along the same track; and the whole can be seen by only the observer standing and watching from the side as it goes by. The engine can't see with accuracy, but is aware of the mass of the whole.\" </p> <p><strong> Alan Garner</strong> </p> <p><strong>Education: </strong> Alderley Edge School; 1945-52 Manchester Grammar School; '54-56 Magdalen College, Oxford. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1956 Ann Cook (one son, two daughters) divorced; '72 Griselda Greaves (one son, one daughter). </p> <p><strong> Some books: </strong> 1960 The Weirdstone of Brisingamen ; '63 The Moon of Gomrath; '65 Elidor; '67 The Owl Service; '73 Red Shift; '75 The Guizer; '76-80 The Stone Book Quartet ('77 Tom Fobble's Day, Granny Reardun; '78 The Aimer Gate; '80 The Lad of the Gad); '96 Strandloper; 2003 Thursbitch. </p> <p><strong> Libretti: </strong> 1971 The Bellybag (music by Richard Morris); '72 Potter Thompson (music by Gordon Crosse). </p> <p><strong> Edited: </strong> 1969 The Hamish Hamilton Book of Goblins; '84 Alan Garner's Book of British Fairy Tales. </p> <p><strong> Honours: </strong> OBE 2001.</p>",
  "<p>It is almost as pale as water and has a gentle floral perfume. Slightly chilled, it tastes a little of lychees, a little of grapefruit, and has the mild astringency of a herbal tea. There is also a kind of gravity to it and, although the flavour is delicate, it blooms in the mouth with a surprising determination. We notice that when we eat, it becomes more intense. This is Japanese sake and it is delicious. </p> <p>Most people wrinkle their noses at the mention of sake, and I can see why. Some of it is abominable - warm and soupy, like a cross between hot paraffin and meat gravy. But it's not all like that and the popularity of Japanese food in this country - these days it's easier to find a sushi bar than a fish and chip shop in London - has encouraged sake aficionados in the belief that we might be persuaded to take to our bosoms the premium version of this interesting drink. For the beginner, the world of sake is quite bewildering. But it is also exciting - rose, persimmon, bamboo leaves, cypress and plum are just a few of the words in the sake taster's vocabulary. </p> <p>And all that from a few grains of rice that have been first polished (to remove the fat and proteins), then soaked in water, then steamed, then fermented. Zuma, the fancy Knightsbridge restaurant, has a long sake list and a sake sommelier. But I tasted my sake at the Cinnamon Club in Westminster, a sprauncy Indian restaurant, if you please, that has just introduced a three-course sake pairing menu. It's a good idea because the key to enjoying sake is to drink it in the right environment, with the right foods - and with confidence. That very pale sake is sold here at \u00a38 a glass, or you could order it from <a href=\"http://www.isake.co.uk\">isake.co.uk</a>. This is a good match with a starter of battered asparagus, a notoriously difficult food to pair with drink. It is also a good learner sake because it isn't as potent as some. </p> <p>'If you're trying to find a similar style, the key words to look for are Junmai Daiginjo,' says sake expert and importer Xavier Chapelou. 'Brewing this demands high levels of skill. At least 50% of the rice will be milled away and the end result is usually fragrant and delicate.' There are also organic sakes, cloudy like coconut water, and vintage sakes with a more pungent, truffle-like taste. </p> <p>What I like best about sake is its strangely meditative quality. It feels thoughtful, complex and calming. A friend has fallen into the habit of ordering it when in New York for a business meeting. He arrives at midnight, checks into 60 Thompson in Soho, and strolls to a sushi bar around the corner for a late supper. A glass of sake provides all the company he needs. It's that kind of drink.</p>",
  "<p>Howard Schultz has virtually pinned to the wall the manager of the cramped Starbucks outlet in Kensington High Street, London, and is peppering her with questions. The king of coffee shops has discovered that Silvia Manili is from Italy, one of the few markets he has yet to conquer. </p> <p>\"Do you think we would go down well there [Italy]?\" he demands to know in a cheery but intense way. </p> <p>The Starbucks founder and chairman is only in the cafe at the request of a photographer but this is an opportunity for market research that can't be missed - along with schmoozing the customers. </p> <p>\"Hi, how are you, where are you from?\" he greets a bemused young couple searching only for coffee. </p> <p>Soon he is bounding off down the pavement to a public speaking engagement - after offering an almost tear-filled \"thank you for your enthusiasm\" to Ms Manili. </p> <p>Schultz is a bundle of energy. He also has the easy charm of a marketing man and none of the stuffiness that can come with success or privilege. </p> <p>A self-made man, the 51-year-old was raised on a public housing project in Brooklyn and never dreamed he would preside over a business stretching from Seattle to Shanghai. </p> <p>He is one of the world's most successful entrepreneurs and is anxious to show his business has a big heart. </p> <p>This week he announced a joint venture with the charity Oxfam under which Starbucks UK will contribute \u00a3100,000 to a rural farming project in Ethiopia, said to be the birthplace of coffee. </p> <p>A genuine attempt to alleviate poverty or a public relations exercise designed to persuade Britain and the world to drink even more of his coffee? The affable Schultz takes the question on the chin. \"I think there is a tremendous amount of cynicism among the general public and consumers, and more often than not rightfully so. </p> <p>\"I read a study a year ago which shocked me. It was about US corporations. In the 1960s, if you introduced a new product to America, 90% of the people who viewed it for the first time believed in the corporate promise. Then 40 years later if you performed the same exercise less than 10% of the public believed it was true. The fracturing of trust is based on the fact that the consumer has been let down.\" </p> <p>Surely the company is also targeted because it represents American capitalism to an anti-globalisation protesters, as occurred in the Seattle riots? </p> <p>\"I would not say we have become a target - it's just we are a ubiquitous brand and ubiquity at times does invite more scrutiny than if we were just a can of Coca-Cola sitting on a supermarket shelf.\" </p> <p>Schultz recalls a recent meeting with a group concerned about certain things Starbucks was doing. </p> <p>\"I asked them about two very large companies that were in the global coffee business: Procter &amp; Gamble and Kraft General Foods. 'Have you knocked on their door as it relates to this subject?' and they said 'no' and I said, 'Do you intend to?' and they said 'no' and I said, 'Well, why?' And here is the answer to your question, which is very perverse. And the answer is, 'We [the critics] are here because we know you care.'\" </p> <p>This, argues Schultz, poses the question of how a firm gets big or stays small. </p> <p>\"I think we are living in a time where the consumer has lots of choices, whether it's coffee, newspapers or whatever it is. And there is parity in the market place and as a result of that the consumer is beginning to make decisions, not just on what things cost and the convenience of it. </p> <p>\"They are making decisions based on a company's values, ethics and whether they are a caring kind ... And what we have been able to do is demonstrate there is an authenticity and a truth to what we do. There are times when we are going to be misunderstood, and we are not perfect.\" </p> <p>Schultz is not perfect - if he had been he would never have built his coffee business. His big love was American football but after winning a sports scholarship to university he failed to make the top grade and opted instead for commerce. </p> <p>After working as a salesman for Xerox he joined Hammarplast, a small Swedish kitchenware importer, and found himself interested in one of his customers in Seattle: Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spice store. </p> <p>Schultz joined the wholesale beverage provider as retail director in 1982 but left after three years to pursue a dream, hatched after a trip to Milan, about creating a chain of espresso bars. </p> <p>He established Il Giornale and in 1987 took over Starbucks with cash from local investors and legal advice from a man called Bill Gates, father of the Microsoft founder, a friend of Schultz. </p> <p>Rapid expansion has given it annual sales of more than $4bn (\u00a32.2bn) and a share price up 3,000% since its 1992 flotation, but its return on capital has been lower than other big brands such as McDonald's because its costs are higher. </p> <p>That is partly, Schultz says, because he is willing to pay higher prices for coffee and partly because his 90,000 staff - full- and part-time - received proper health and insurance benefits. </p> <p>\"I grew up in a working class family where there was no health insurance. I saw first hand the fracturing of the American dream and the bitterness that comes when there is no hope and a lot of despair. So I wanted to build the company, in a sense, that my father never got a chance to work for.\" </p> <p>Schultz can talk like a runaway train but he can also be tight-lipped when he wants to be. Asked if he could imagine a time when coffee providers would be sued because of potential health problems, in the way tobacco or food suppliers are, he looks astonished. </p> <p>Surely he is aware that some experts argue that coffee is bad for you? \"No.\" Discussion closed. </p> <p>The Starbucks founder insists one cannot stand on the sidelines in any critical debate on what he describes as the \"fracturing of humanity\". Yet, asked about his position on the Iraqi conflict, he says: \"I'm sorry, it's not for me to comment on that.\" </p> <p>What he does like to talk about is Starbucks' commercial success in Britain, where the company has turned profitable six years after it launched here. </p> <p>\"We have over 400 stores [in the UK] and unit economics are very healthy. A recent study marked Starbucks as the market leader but we are at the early stages of the growth development.\" </p> <p>The company, which recently opened an outlet in Northern Ireland, will not say what its target is for British growth but it believes its 8,500 stores worldwide can increase to 25,000. </p> <p>Schultz has other ambitions, too. His Hear Music Coffeehouse offers up to 70 computer terminals where customers can browse through 20,000 albums and burn whatever tracks they want on to a CD to take home. </p> <p>Five weeks ago Starbucks released a record on the Hear Music label, of the recently deceased Ray Charles playing with other musicians including Elton John. </p> <p>\"This has created a sea-change in the music industry because of the power of Starbucks's distribution,\" Schultz says. \"So we are evolving or leveraging the brand into other products and services that are complementary to the experience, and we are very intrigued with these things.\" </p> <p>The wider opportunities can be seen by Schultz from another vantage point - his board membership of DreamWorks Animations, the maker of films such as Shrek. </p> <p>In the meantime he has lost none of his enthusiasm for coffee.

  "<p>Muslims must reach out and connect with other Britons as equal citizens, and resist the impulse to withdraw into isolated communities, one of the foremost thinkers on Islam in Europe will tell his audience this evening at the European Social Forum in London. </p> <p>Tariq Ramadan urges Muslims to embrace and get to know the culture and history of the countries they live in in Europe, and develop a \"blossoming\" confidence as the inheritors of Islam, one of Europe's great faiths. </p> <p>\"The situation is bad throughout Europe, and now is the time for Muslims to reach out and create partnerships,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Muslims must stop the perception of victimisation and their obsession with their minority status - that way we are nurturing the idea that we are not really at home here, and that is reinforced by governments. </p> <p>\"There are millions of Muslims in Europe and always have been. It is a distorted history which omits the role of Islam in the construction of European consciousness.\" </p> <p>In recent years, Mr Ramadan, the author of several academic books, has been attacked from all sides for attempting to formulate a modern, moderate, confident Islam. </p> <p>He has been named as one of the 100 most influential thinkers in the world by Time magazine, but that did not stop his US visa being revoked under the Patriot Act in July, when he wanted to take up a professorship at Notre Dame University in Indiana. </p> <p>Mr Ramadan, who was born and educated in Geneva, is teaching by teleconference while the US authorities reconsider his application. </p> <p>He had been admitted to the US many times, and given a presentation to the state department on European Islam. </p> <p>He has also been barred from many Muslim countries for his advocacy of democracy and human rights. </p> <p>\"A silent revolution is coming in how Muslims think about themselves and about the universal common values they share with the west, and about democracy and modernity,\" he says. The develop-ment of a European Islam will have a \"tremendous impact on Islam throughout the world\". </p> <p>But Mr Ramadan says fear is being used as an ideological weapon: \"It gives governments a kind of political control - 'We will monitor you in order to protect you' - a new ideology when all the others are so empty.\" </p> <p>At stake, he says, is not just the wellbeing of the Muslim community, but the values and principles of western democracy: \"The way Muslim people are treated is undermining British values such as freedom of conscience, equality before the law, and anti-racism.\" </p> <p>\"We need to develop mutual knowledge, not just tolerance. The question is, what are you doing to find out about others? Respect comes out of knowledge; when you recognise my reality is as complex as yours, that's when you begin to know me andrespect me.\" </p> <p>Mr Ramadan's grandfather, Hassan al-Banna, was the founder of one of the most powerful Muslim political movements in the 20th century, the Muslim Brotherhood. But Mr Ramadan is careful to distinguish his own thinking, particularly on violence. </p> <p>\"There is an acceptable diversity within Islam, but killing innocent lives has to be condemned,\" he says. In situations such as modern-day Israel, \"the context may explain the killing, but it can never justify it\". </p> <p><strong>Highlights of the European Social Forum</strong></p> <p><strong>Today</strong> </p> <p>Debates: Muslims in Europe; disarmament; world food day; environment; third world; European citizenship </p> <p>Culture: Palestine rappers; Dark art music; Rasta international; Iraq - the opera; films on the WTO, water and Argentina </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong> </p> <p>March from Russell Square to Trafalgar Square, 1pm </p> <p>Debates: Iraq occupation; IMF and World Bank; privatisation </p> <p>Culture: Italian marching protest band; Brazilian Capoeira; Asian Dub Foundation, Peter Doherty and others</p>",
  "<p>Each year over 40,000 workers die or suffer major injuries at work in Britain, and since April 1992, over 1,000 workers in the construction industry alone have lost their lives. Between April 2003 and March 2004, 70 building workers lost their lives, accounting for 30% of all the deaths at work last year and in the past six months, 37 construction workers died on building sites across Britain. </p> <p>It's against this sombre backdrop that next week has been designated European Week of Health and Safety. The focus of European Health and Safety Week 2004 is \"building in safety\", which aims to make the construction industry a safer, healthier and more productive working environment. </p> <p>TUC deputy general secretary, Frances O'Grady, says: \"Construction deaths at work are on the increase again. Employers will only change their poor health and safety practices when they realise that they are likely to be punished if found guilty of causing the deaths of their staff or members of the public. The government must publish its proposals for a new corporate manslaughter law before the beginning of the next session of Parliament.\" </p> <p>The number of construction workers in Britain has risen by almost 100,000 in the past decade, so a rise in accidents was likely. But, says Ms O'Grady, the industry still needs to end irresponsible working practices that endangers lives. </p> <p>The European Health and Safety Week is also giving a special attention to the maintenance and repair activities that are carried out in all workplaces, and the risks from asbestos exposure. According to the health and safety executive's data there are half a million commercial properties in the UK containing undisturbed asbestos. </p> <p>Asbestos is the biggest occupational health risk ever faced by workers in Britain, at least 3,500 people died in 2002-03 as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres. The annual number of deaths is expected to peak somewhere in the range 4,000 to 5,000, between the years 2011 and 2015. However, the actual peak figure could be even higher. </p> <p>From last May, anyone who owns commercial or industrial property or is responsible for its maintenance, must check for asbestos and manage the risk properly. The same will apply to public buildings and to the common parts of other property such as blocks of flats. Asbestos becomes dangerous when disturbed; if maintenance workers are not warned of its presence they may release deadly fibres and unwittingly endanger lives. </p> <p>Bill Callaghan, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, says: \"Asbestos is not yesterday's problem. We must now meet the challenge of managing the risks from asbestos, if we are to prevent another generation of workers suffering an early death at its hand.\" </p> <p>In a separate move, an Institute of Employment Rights report highlights the extent to which the UK government has failed to meet its own targets for improvement contributing to the health and safety at work issue. The report - Health and Safety: Revitalised or Reversed? - argues that a voluntary approach to health and safety established by the 1974 Health and Safety Act has failed. Enforcement of health and safety has declined with a 12% cut in local authority inspectors and a 20% cut in workplace visits. </p> <p> <em>Health and Safety: Revitalised or Reversed? by Phil James and David Walters priced \u00a320 is available from IER, 177 Abbeville Road, London SW4 9RL.</em></p> <p><strong> \u00b7</strong> For Health and Safety Executive's InfoLine, tel: 08701 545500, or write to: HSE Information Services, Caerphilly Business Park, Caerphilly CF83 3GG.</p>",
  "Plans for 478,000 new homes across the east of England were agreed by regional planners yesterday, who demanded the government provide \u00a31.6bn over the next three years to subsidise affordable homes for key workers and better roads and public transport. <p>Members of the regional planning panel rejected plans put forward by the regional development minister, Lord Rooker, to add another 18,000 houses to the Peterborough, Cambridge, Stevenage and Harlow corridor because of damage to the environment and lack of water supplies. </p> <p>Members also made clear that they opposed the proposed second runways at Stansted and Luton airports. </p> <p>John Reynolds, the panel's chairman, said: \"We have agreed that communities across the east of England can take another 478,000 homes up to 2021, but only if the gov-ernment is prepared to stump up for the required infra-structure to support them. In particular, we have asked for \u00a3600m to support affordable homes for key workers. </p> <p>\"The government must realise houses on this scale cannot be built unless the communities get the support they need in terms of roads, train and bus travel. Lord Rooker has promised us support - now we want to see the money.\" </p> <p>He said the panel felt this was a suitable moment to make clear its opposition to the runways: \"We support the expansion of the existing airports to their full capacity using existing runways, but that is where we draw the line.\" </p> <p>Mr Reynolds said the figures for each area had been adjusted to take in the concerns of some councils, and extra homes had been allocated to Harlow and Stevenage to help with the regeneration of those centres. The new housing will add 20% to the 5.5 million population of the region's six counties. </p> <p>Lord Hanningford, the leader of Essex council, condemned the decision to require his council to provide space for 123,000 homes without supporting evidence from a regional economic strategy. </p> <p>Peter Martin, who is responsible for planning, enterprise and regeneration, committed Essex council to continue to fight for no more than 110,000 new houses. </p> <p>\"Essex needs 80,000 new homes to support changes within the county's population and it is reasonable that we absorb 30,000 new houses to play our part in accommodating population movement from elsewhere in the UK as a whole,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But without having more convincing figures on job creation ... it is impossible to see the additional houses being proposed as anything other than the creation of empty commuter towns that are neither socially or environmentally sustainable.\" </p> <p>The proposals are also opposed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England, which says they were not designed to meet need, but driven by government targets. </p> <p>\"These proposals will throw petrol on the flames of development pressure in the region at the expense of the environment, people's quality of life and the prosperity of less wealthy English regions,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>Trade union leaders yesterday called on the government and employers to take immediate action to tackle the problem of the growing numbers of workers being killed on Britain's building sites. </p> <p>The TUC is asking the government to fulfil its manifesto pledge to bring in legislation on corporate manslaughter and wants employers to put much greater emphasis on training employees. </p> <p>\"Construction [industry] deaths are on the increase. Employers will only change their poor health and safety practices when they realise that they are likely to be punished if found guilty of causing the deaths of their staff or members of the public,\" according to TUC deputy general secretary Frances O'Grady. </p> <p>\"The government must publish its proposals for a new corporate manslaughter law before the beginning of the next session of parliament,\" she added. </p> <p>The CBI responded by insisting that any legislation should be even-handed and apply equally to the public as well as the private sector. </p> <p>Michael Roberts, director of business environment at the employers' organisation, said: \"If the government is going to press ahead on corporate manslaughter, it must ensure that the legislation is fair. The grossly negligent must be separated from genuinely responsible employers who do everything possible to ensure safety.\" </p> <p>Figures from the TUC show that more than 1,000 workers have died on construction jobs since 1992. In the past six months alone 37 workers have lost their lives. </p> <p>The TUC says that part of the increase stems from structural changes in the industry as big companies turn increasingly to subcontractors. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of very small contractors, which makes it very difficult to manage [safety]. They don't do things like risk assessments and there is often very little communication between different groups,\" Hugh Robertson, the TUC's head of health and safety, said. </p> <p>Another factor is the growing use on construction sites of workers for whom English is not their first language. </p> <p>Mr Robertson argues that such workers need to be taught health and safety in their own languages. \"They have to understand the [safety] message, not simply be told it. If things are explained in English and they don't understand, they are not going to say so.\"</p>",
  "It was, said Michel, 19, from Paris, like standing in the departure lounge to a better world, with everyone heading to a different destination. <p>\"Some go to socialism, others to communism, anarchy, ecology,\" he said. \"Some take the first plane that leaves. I'm going to sit down, have a cup of tea and try to take this in.\" </p> <p>The opening day of the European social forum was indeed a lot to digest: 20,000 people from 65 countries who had descended on Alexandra Palace in north London. </p> <p>Organisers were overwhelmed at the event's popularity and participants bewildered at the gigantic choice of cause, issue, ideology, politics and visions of other worlds from more than 2,000 organisations and several hundred artists. </p> <p>By 10.15am, Michel, who had come to London out of political curiosity but was not a member of any group, had already attended a meeting of international trade unionists who had been discussing the perils of privatisation and the EU's move to the right. </p> <p>He could now listen to a Nigerian lawyer on the west's oil addiction, join a workshop on migration and European fiscal justice, or debate media alternatives, GM foods and human rights in Columbia. Or he could head to Birkbeck College to hear about global governance and do a workshop in ethical education. </p> <p>He paused, and what he got for the next 10 minutes was his ear bent by a north London matron urging him to support an Asian Marxist resistance group, and an \"interesting discussion\" with a man on the Landmine Action stall who showed him plastic replicas of anti-personnel mines. </p> <p>\"I'd never seen them before. They looked so innocent. I was so shocked and angry,\" he said. </p> <p>\"There are far too many people here, far too much on offer, but that is fine\", said Jesus de la Roza, a Spanish teacher in London. </p> <p>\"It's a bit chaotic but to see so many alternatives is inspiring. I'm here because Europe's services are now all being privatised. What started with industrial jobs is moving to health, pensions, education, especially in England.\" </p> <p>As groups of Italians students arrived with their rucksacks and packs of sandwiches, and British and French trade unionists queued for beer and burgers from a truck outside, Mike Masel, a Belgian, took up the privatisation issue in a formal debate.</p> <p>\"The real reason why they want to privatise everything in Europe is that social services don't bring in enough money. They have to privatise water and hospitals to sell abroad,\" he said to cheers. </p> <p>A group of artists billed as handing out money all day as a revolutionary act against capitalism had not appeared (\"They've probably done a runner,\" said an organiser) but there were plenty of people eager to relieve participants of a tenner for sweatshirts, fair trade footballs, posters, books and T-shirts. </p> <p>Hans, a German studying in London, said the best T-shirts read: I Still Hate Thatcher, Do You Work For a Psycho?; Blair Lied; and Vote Nobody. \"I like this invitation to an anarchist group experience with Soma. It says it refreshes the parts that capitalism steals from you? Is Soma a drug?\" </p> <p>A forum spokesman said: \"About 17-20,000 people have attended today from more than 65 countries, 60% are from the UK and the most of the rest from France, Italy, Germany and Spain.\" </p> <p>Alan McManus, a volunteer about to attempt to interpret the Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams into Spanish via broad Glaswegian, said the atmosphere of the event was the best part. \"The aim of the forum may not always be clear, but the method is.\"</p>",
  "Susan George (This is the way to win, October 15) says that she cannot vote for the European constitutional treaty because it would \"enshrine the competitive free market at the heart of Europe's identity, exclude all mention of solidarity and cooperation; make subservience to Nato mandatory and render all its provisions irreversible for decades\". <p>In fact, the treaty talks about creating \"a highly competitive social market economy\" with \"full employment and social progress\", highlighting the need to \"combat social exclusion and discrimination\" and \"promote social justice and protection as priorities\". The treaty also allows EU members that wish to to undertake peacekeeping and other military tasks outside the Nato framework and without an American veto. And although a treaty that has been ratified in all 25 EU member states rightly cannot be easily changed, it certainly does not preclude amendments or new treaties in future. </p> <p>David Clark sets out a compelling leftwing case for the new treaty in The Labour Movement Case for Europe (<a href=\"http://www.britainineurope.org.uk\">www.britainineurope.org.uk</a>).

  "British troops are likely to be deployed outside southern Iraq for the first time in support of US troops in some of the worst trouble spots in the country, including Baghdad, it emerged last night. <p>The Ministry of Defence confirmed that contingency plans are being drawn up to deploy a battle group of around 650 men to cover for American troops while they carry out offensive operations against insurgents in Falluja and elsewhere. </p> <p>The planned deployment - understood to be the result of a formal request for assistance from US forces - will be the first time British troops have operated inside the Sunni Triangle around Baghdad where the majority of attacks against the occupying forces have occurred. </p> <p>It is expected the troops will be under overall US command, though the Pentagon last night would not confirm that a formal request for troops had been made. </p> <p>The deployment would also mark a major escalation in Britain's involvement in the occupation of Iraq. </p> <p>The prime minister is thought to have flown back early from a conference in Budapest yesterday morning to deal with the issue. </p> <p>\"There are a series of contingency plans being worked up, but no decisions have been made,\" a spokesman for the MoD said last night. </p> <p>However, a military source, asked if he thought the troop movement would happen, said: \"If I was a betting man I would say yes.\" </p> <p>He added: \"There is contingency planning going on at the moment to assist the US in their future operations to try and create an environment for elections to go ahead. </p> <p>\"They are going to give a severe slap to Falluja - that has been pretty well documented - and a number of contingency plans are being looked at that would allow British troops to go and look after areas to allow US troops to mount offensive operations.\" </p> <p>But the source categorically denied reports that the Black Watch - the regiment most likely to be sent in support of US troops - would be used in any battle for Falluja. </p> <p>The source was also unable to put any timescale on the possible deployment. \"If the decision is taken I would imagine it could happen very quickly,\" he said. </p> <p>A total of 68 British troops have been killed in Iraq since the start of the war, compared with 1,062 Americans. \"British forces should not be placed under direct US command, nor deployed outside the existing British area of operation without reference to the House of Commons,\" said Paul Keetch, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. \"The prime minister should know that to do this at this time would not have the broad support of the British people.\" </p> <p>The US has been threatening a major offensive against Falluja and other insurgent strongholds for several weeks. </p> <p>As the holy month of Ramadan began yesterday US warplanes continued to bomb the city, a day after community leaders suspended peace talks and rejected the Iraqi government's demands to turn over Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the terrorist mastermind blamed for murdering the British contractor Ken Bigley. </p> <p>In a statement read at sermons in mosques in Baghdad and elsewhere, Falluja's clerics called for civil disobedience across Iraq if the Americans try to overrun the insurgent bastion. If that did not halt an offensive, the clerics said they would proclaim a jihad - holy war - against multinational forces \"as well as those collaborating with them\". </p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq a British security guard has been shot dead near the northern city of Kirkuk.

  "Plato: an apology. In this column a few weeks ago, it was suggested that the eminent philosopher Plato would not qualify for an all-time Great Greeks football XI because all the best Greek footballers had names ending in S and Plato did not. In a subsequent column, this statement was withdrawn on the grounds that Plato's real name was Aristokles thus entitling him, a panel of independent experts suggested, to a place in the squad. This assertion was in turn withdrawn with due apologies after readers pointed out that the claim that Plato's real name was Aristokles had no reliable basis in fact. However, a communication from Greece has now reached me suggesting that the proper designation for Plato would be Platonas, which ends in S and therefore qualifies him for a place in the lineup. I apologise to Plato for his wrongful omission and later de-reinstatement, to Aristokles for suggesting he might be Plato, and to anyone else, living or dead or both, who feels offended or wronged. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Donald Rumsfeld: an apology. In this column a few months ago, it was claimed that on the record of his handling of US activity in Iraq, the US defence secretary, though recognised as a clever fellow, was also one of the world's great fools. Smallweed was foully berated for this contention both in emails from the US, some of them containing a number of vulgar expressions, and by commentators elsewhere in the British press. Further evidence has now come to light which necessitates a reassessment. This includes the defence secretary's assertion that, regardless of what he had said on previous occasions, there was not, after all, a connection between Saddam and al-Qaida, followed by his claim that he hadn't said what he'd clearly said; and the charge by Paul Bremer that the two great US blunders in Iraq had been sending too few troops (Rumbo's decision) and misunderestimating the level of subsequent chaos (also Rumbo's responsibility); together with the rest of the indictment marshalled by Simon Tisdall in Wednesday's Guardian. An apology of Beckhamesque proportions is now due to Smallweed from those who challenged a verdict on Rumbo that all sensible people must now surely regard as unimpeachable. Such a shame that Rumbo is apparently unimpeachable too. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Vicar of Bray: an apology. It has come to my notice ... </p> <p> A pedant writes: Why this sudden spate of apologies? Where will it end? Are you not in danger of closing the stable door after the cat is out of the bag? </p> <p> Smallweed replies with an unseemly simper: On the contrary: now that rampant apologism is sweeping the country, this column has to be part of the trend. Grovelling apologies, drivelling apologies, snivelling apologies, apologies grave and gay, apologies fuelled by guilt and apologies fuelled by cynical calculation, veiled apologies, failed apologies, heavily trailed apologies - there's no holding the pretty creatures back. Take the case of Tony Blair. Some believe he apologised at Labour's conference for uttering dud information on the threat from Iraq. Others say he approached an apology but then veered away. The root of the trouble seems to be that he said he could apologise rather than that he did. Clerical sources tell me he has had this kind of problem before. </p> <p>Priest: Do you Anthony Charles Lynton take this woman Cherie to be your lawful wedded wife? </p> <p>Anthony Charles: I can. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mumpokers: an apology. In a recent column I suggested that mumpoker was a term used on the Isle of Wight to frighten naughty children, as in: \"I will send the mumpoker after you.\" My thanks are due to those who have written in to suggest that, for reasons we need not go into, the mumpoker could be your dad. I deeply regret the omission. I have also to apologise for failing to mention that other items listed in James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps' Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words (1850) include Mulligrub-gurgin - a grub which feeds exclusively on gurgin meal; mumble-a-sparrow - a cruel sport practised at wakes and fairs in which a cock sparrow, the wings of which have been clipped, is inserted into a top hat and subjected to further indignities that are best not gone into in a column some of whose readers might just be sadist; and murdering-pie - the butcher bird. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It is clear from the Lords debate on hunting that people who follow this pastime feel they have nothing for which to apologise. Indeed, they take pride in what they do and proudly proclaim their allegiance to it. It seems odd in the circumstances that most profiles supplied by candidates for the forthcoming elections to the council of the National Trust make no mention of hunting. Sophie Scruton of Wiltshire, for instance: could she be some relation to the hunting-crazed philosopher Roger Scruton? What false modesty can have dissuaded her from adding blood sports to a list of interests that at present runs to children, horses and gardening for biodiversity (weeds, seeds and bugs)? What of Robert Waley-Cohen (art, architecture, environment, horse sports) - nominated by hunting-fanatical Labour peer Lady Mallalieu? Are we to take it that \"horse sports\" merely means polo? If Hugh van Cutsem can list \"field sports\" among his interests, why can't others of this persuasion do the same? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Deritend: an apology. I promised last week to give further attention to the justly famous Birmingham suburb of Deritend, a locale, I suggested that might form the basis for another great British movie in the tradition of Notting Hill, Shoreditch and Wimbledon. Next week, perhaps. Except that I won't be appearing next week. Best if I just say: later. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:MrSmallweed@aol.com\">MrSmallweed@aol.com</a></p>"
