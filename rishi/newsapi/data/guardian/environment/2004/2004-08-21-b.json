  "<p>Inside my dining room cabinet is a green card with a set of numbers on it. They are contact numbers at the university where my youngest son, the third of my children to go, is studying and were sent to us, together with an advice leaflet for parents, when we paid his first term's hall of residence rent. </p> <p>We paid the rent, even though he took out a loan, because said rent amounted to \u00a32,800 for the year, more than the loan. If we hadn't paid it, he would not have eaten or bought books.</p> <p>He picked the card up when his first year ended and came home. \"What is this?\" he asked, eyeing it and me suspiciously. \"A card that was sent to us,\" I said. \"I just stuck it there because ... well what else was I to do?\"</p> <p>What indeed? Sussex, no slouch as universities go, one of those keen on producing thinking adults as graduates, had sent me the card. I was about to bin it, but I got a guilty twinge. If they thought I needed to be able to reach them quickly, then maybe I did? </p> <p>My son and I talked it through. We had this conversation sitting in the sun with a beer each. Three years ago, when he was 17 and studying English at A-level, we went to see Ethan Hawke playing Hamlet and then, in the heart of London's West End, I offered to buy him a beer. In the first pub we walked into, the Australian barmaid asked me to prove he was old enough to drink. We turned on our heels and went to the pub across the road, where they served us without a glance. </p> <p>The feeling I had then matched the feeling the address card prompted. Did someone out there forget that children grow up? Maybe 17 is young for beer, even with your mum. But at 20, after a gap year working to earn your passage then travelling through Vietnam and Thailand, surely you are old enough to look after yourself at university without your parents having access to a \"Big Sir\" to check your progress? </p> <p>In the five years since my oldest son went to university the degree to which parents are expected, indeed invited, to be part of their undergraduate offspring's academic life has mushroomed alarmingly. It has spread to match the increasing parental hysteria about getting baby into the most hot-housed nursery, into worrying about primary school Sats results and about secondary school GCSE A-C grade results. </p> <p>Throughout that time I have been writing about university education and talking, as a journalist, to admissions tutors around the country about many topics, not least the emotional wellbeing of undergraduates and their ability to handle university life. </p> <p>It appears that there is a correlation between the emotional maturity of the undergraduate and their ability to survive, and indeed benefit, from university. It is something akin to the toughness of a plant that has grown outdoors. </p> <p>All admissions tutors agree that the more emotionally mature undergraduates are, the more receptively they study and that the most mature are those whose parents stay at a safe distance. Not parents who are off the screen, but ones who put themselves discreetly into waiting, to deal with a crisis if one arises but otherwise to back off. </p> <p>But the admissions tutors are also, a touch shamefacedly, party to organising the burgeoning websites and parents' contact points that allow those parents who feel a need to keep in touch a way of doing so. </p> <p>The universities are in a dilemma. Not only do most of them feel that students would work better with less parental interference, but they are in a legal bind as well. Undergraduates are over 18, and are therefore legally adults. The parents have no legal right to know what is happening to them. The university has no power to tell, unless there is an emergency. It is something on which admissions tutors work at maintaining a balance. If Ma or Da rings in a dither because Student hasn't phoned home all week, tutor will point out that it can be a good thing. It can mean Student has settled well into this new life. </p> <p>What is happening, as the green card in my cupboard indicates, is a compromise. Parents are being invited in to look on open days at courses and at university accommodation. They are also given contact points and advice leaflets and websites to look at. But somewhere in the fine print of all that is being offered there is the message: back off, let your child mature. </p> <p>Other parents and teachers I have talked to come up with several answers. Properly, of course, parents need to have knowledge to help their would-be undergraduate make sensible decisions and also need to be sure there is proper back- up available if something goes wrong. </p> <p>On that score, all universities run welfare networks, including putting post- graduate students to live in halls as a point of contact and working with the students\u00bf union welfare officers and housing officers to look out for those who are failing to cope. </p> <p>But beyond that, the repeated parental refrain is: \"Well, I suppose that now we are expected to pay so much, we need to know that we are getting our money's worth.\" Parents always paid. In the days of grants, there was still an element of parental contribution. Even those on full grants mostly still had back-up. They were kept in the holidays. Their clothes were bought for them. Their books were bought. With undergraduates of traditional age, the 18- to 20-year-olds, most will be going away from home for the first time, and even those living at home will be going into a far more challenging academic environment in which they will need to be far more self-reliant. Parents will be involved, certainly financially and emotionally.</p> <p>However, what they need to be, for the welfare of their personal undergraduates, is involved, but not busybodies.</p>",
  "Liberal scorn has been heaped upon Tony Blair and David Blunkett for their professed commitment to address \"antisocial behaviour\". The government is said to be \"pandering to a Daily Mail agenda\". Yet the public is insulted every day by obscenity and petty crime. A lot of people who are not of the right, but merely care about Britain's status as a civilised society, want something done. <p>The other afternoon, I was a passenger on a crowded holiday train heading for the West Country. On the seats across from me sat a young man, maybe 20, with his girlfriend. He wore a sweatshirt bearing in large letters the proclamation: \"I am a cunt.\" </p> <p>Some readers may think such an assertion perfectly reasonable in these enlightened times. I dissent. I was a good deal larger than him, so I said: \"What do you think it's like for mothers and children who have to look at that? Is this really something you want to advertise?\". </p> <p>To my mild surprise, he made no reply, but gazed out of the window while his girlfriend looked resentful. I got out at the next station, and have since thought a lot about that incident. I must have looked and sounded pretty pompous, delivering such a homily in my pinstripe suit. Yet I have no regrets. That young man should not have been allowed on to a train wearing that sweatshirt. No civilised society acquiesces in the publication of obscenities in public places, though British theatre and television set a vile example. </p> <p>The problem is: what to do about it, or about even uglier manifestations, which have stirred the government to promise action. Many aspects of antisocial behaviour are not susceptible to criminal law. No politician or media organisation should employ the word \"crackdown\" without irony. Any announcement of a government crackdown on drugs, dangerous dogs, litter or pollution presages mere huffing and puffing. </p> <p>Crackdown is a term abused by ministers when aspiring to win public approbation by promising undefined action to curb an ill which they know in their hearts is not susceptible to politically directed suppression. </p> <p>Antisocial behaviour, at the lighter end of which is the wearing of an obscene sweatshirt in a public place, can only be redressed by social forces. The perpetrator is most likely to desist if he or she is obliged to accept that a given course is unacceptable to schools, universities, employers, public services and his or her community. </p> <p>At present, there is no social pressure at all. Most people show themselves too indifferent - or too physically frightened - to protest about anything. My 91-year-old mother's purse was snatched by teenagers on a bus the other day, but nobody else moved a muscle. We know how serious is the problem of intimidation in schools and hospitals, and on the transport system. I remember a headteacher saying years ago: \"It is unrealistic to imagine that a school can impose, during the hours in which it has custody of a child, values and behaviour quite at odds from those which prevail at home.\" </p> <p>When brooding about these things, I try to preserve a sense of historical context, recalling the yobbishness of some of the old ruling class. A hunt that flourished in mid-19th century Hertfordshire took pride in some splendid runs through the local market gardens. A thrusting peer complained jovially that he found the asparagus beds \"damn heavy going\". </p> <p>This was antisocial behaviour of a notably obnoxious kind, which exploited the social impotence of the market gardeners. The vandals had none of the excuses available to the modern underclass. Yet there came a time - around the beginning of the 20th century - when yobbish toffs had to stop behaving like that, less because they were threatened with legal sanctions than because society would no longer put up with it. </p> <p>Today, we place an excessive premium on the absolute merits of tolerance. The collapse of social deference towards what were once called one's betters is one of the most pleasing things to have happened to Britain in the past half-century. Yet a price has been paid, because with deference has vanished a lot of respect - not blind respect for \"social superiors\", but human respect for others among whom we live. </p> <p>The Sun has a lot to answer for. Yobbish behaviour has always existed, but was tacitly recognised even by some of those who practised it as beyond the pale. Rupert Murdoch has done more than any other single person to legitimise yobbery. The Sun might be described as the house organ of the antisocial classes. </p> <p>Like many young broadcasters, it regards with implicit or explicit disdain the most important manifestation of respect, manners. This is an unfashionable word. Anybody who urges a dissident pupil, or noisy fellow-traveller, to \"show some manners\" invites at best derision, at worst a punch in the face. Yet to address antisocial behaviour, what we need is not legislation or some spurious crackdown, but a revival of acknowledgement that without manners, we inhabit a jungle. </p> <p>An individual's right to self-expression is not absolute. Every citizen has a duty to consider how his or her actions will impact on others. The man in an open car who plays his radio at maximum volume pollutes the environment of everybody he passes. Reckless discarding of litter is a scourge. Dog-owners have been conditioned to use pooper-scoopers in urban park. Why should not soft drink consumers be persecuted until they put their cans in bins? Public transport seats are designated for the old and infirm, yet in rush hour they are almost always occupied by the young. </p> <p>Bystanders are not only entitled to make a fuss, it is their duty to do so. The intrepid Claire Tomalin recently reproached a large underground traveller for lighting a cigarette. Somewhat grudgingly, he put it out. The judge who recently ejected a juror from court for wearing an FCUK T-shirt was dead right. In a properly civilised society, any business which gave itself such a name would be boycotted. </p> <p>Only by protest, daily niggling, harassing protest, is antisocial behaviour likely to be diminished. In cases where noisy or drunken young men are involved, don't just cross the street, call the police. I am not proposing that the culprits should be immediately removed to the cells. The police are merely better equipped than the rest of us to rebuke potentially violent miscreants. Somebody has got to do it. If we continue to tolerate antisocial behaviour, it will increase and multiply. </p> <p>Some may shrug that I sound like a Home Counties magistrate, circa 1935. Maybe, but what would you do? Can we preserve the decencies if we acquiesce in the abuses of language and conduct great and small that each of us sees every day? Tony Blair and David Blunkett are right to think the public is fed up to the teeth with in-yer-face obscenities and wantonly selfish behaviour. </p> <p>The problem demands a social, not political response. We need perpetrators to be shown the red card day after day until they quit or go somewhere else. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Fell pony, one of the UK's rarest semi-wild breeds, will slide towards extinction unless its importance in preserving the character of Britain's uplands is recognised and breeders are given support, the government will be told in a report. </p> <p>David Murray, an independent consultant, says the ancient breed is crucial to maintaining the character of the Lake District, as changes to agriculture policy mean there will be fewer sheep in the hills, which need grazing animals to allow rare wild plants to thrive. </p> <p>He will draw the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' attention to the ponies' plight. </p> <p>An international geographers' conference in Glasgow heard that there are only 246 breeding mares registered, most of them living in the mountains of Cumbria. </p> <p>Unlike farm animals, the Fell ponies attract no subsidy or support. They have lived in Britain's uplands for thousands of years, but their numbers are dwindling. </p> <p>The breed is one of nine descended from the pre-historic horse Tarpan which are still living in Britain. The others, including the New Forest, Dartmoor and Shetland breeds, are better known. </p> <p>Fell ponies live between 200 and 750 metres (650-2,500ft) above sea level, and are exceptionally hardy. They are able to survive in temperatures of -20C (-4F), and lose up to a third of their body weight in winter. </p> <p>Although they are privately owned, the ponies roam the hills in small herds and are semi-wild, keeping clear of people where possible. Of the 24 herds, 20 are in Cumbria, with others in Northumberland, Morayshire and Perthshire. </p> <p>Mr Murray said: \"There is no incentive to keep these animals but for that fact that the farmers are enthusiasts, but they are getting older and there is no one to replace them. These ponies are not just a part of our heritage, they also have a vital future role in keeping the fells as we want them to be.\" </p> <p>He said the old system of paying hill farmers according to the number of sheep and cattle on their land had been abolished in January. This was expected to lead to a dramatic decrease in grazing stock on the hills, which could change the appearance of the landscape as bigger grasses and scrub took over. </p> <p>A study of the ponies' eating habits showed that they ignored wild flowers and heather, but ate the rough grasses and the bark of shrubs - exactly the kind of management the hills need. </p> <p>Mr Murray's report, commissioned by Defra and supported by English Nature, will call for legislation to protect the Fell pony and funding to allow the breed to survive. </p> <p>The ponies are remnants of a much larger population used in the 19th century to haul coal, carry milkmen and deliver post to outlying farms. Domestic versions are used for riding and trekking, but it is the semi-wild herds in the hills Mr Murray believes should be protected for the sake of the landscape. </p> <p>He is doing a second study for the Brecon Beacons national park into another pony variety, the Welsh Mountain pony, which is also semi-wild. Although it is less threatened it is still in decline for similar reasons. </p> <p>\"All these ponies, apart from being important as part of our distinctive regional heritage, are part of a proper form of land management for the uplands,\" he said. \"We need to look after them, value them, and bring them back in sufficient numbers to help keep the vegetation in a state so other wild creatures, plants and birds can thrive.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lake District scientists are trying to save Britain's rarest fish, the Vendace, which only lives in two lakes, Bassenthwaite and Derwent Water. </p> <p>The fish, a relict of the ice age, has stopped breeding in Bassenthwaite because the shoreline gravel in which it lays its eggs has been smothered in sediment washed down from the hills and river banks. Scientists want trees planted on the bank to catch the sediment, and changes to grazing practices on the fells.</p>",
  "<p>It is paradoxical that Gordon Brown chooses to castigate Opec's members for failing to produce enough oil to bring prices down while ignoring Britain's role as one of the world's top 10 oil and gas producing countries. He also fails to recognise that declining UK oil and gas output results from a less than proactive government policy for the country's hydrocarbons industry. </p> <p>Initially, this arose from the government's ideological unwillingness to make public investments in oil and gas exploration and production. More recently, it has reflected the government's obsession with a perceived need to constrain carbon fuel use and to stimulate green energy production with generous subsidies. </p> <p>Last year's energy white paper epitomised the government's anti-oil and gas attitudes. It devoted 60 lines to the UK's world-scale upstream hydrocarbons industry from a total of 5,000. Since 1974, it produced some 4,500m tonnes of oil equivalent, equating to more than 75% of the UK's total energy use in this period. </p> <p>Apart from the 30 years of security of energy supply which domestic production has given, the impact on GDP, on industrial investments, on direct and indirect employment and - most of all - on its balance of trade has been formidable. Net export earnings from domestic oil and gas since 1998 have contributed almost \u00a36bn a year to the balance of trade, while the value of the energy import substitution effect has averaged \u00a39bn a year. Without oil and gas, the \u00a330bn average annual trade deficit over the period would have been 50% greater. </p> <p>Given these advantages, the absence of any calculations in the white paper of the resource costs for the country from the change from net energy exports of 28m tonnes of oil equivalent in 2003 to net imports of 190m tonnes in 2020 is inexplicable. At current price levels, the swing will generate an annual burden on the balance of trade of \u00a325bn-\u00a328bn, adding 65%-85% to the already formidable trade deficit. Moreover, the near-100% security of energy supply will be reduced by 75%. </p> <p>The white paper and the policies based on it do not address these issues, nor the consequential GDP and employment losses, nor the impact of severely reduced investment to the upstream hydrocarbon industry - accounting for 16% of total industrial investment in the UK. </p> <p>We need a comprehensive inquiry into the assumptions that underlie the government's acceptance of a decline in oil and gas production. Such an inquiry must include the following: </p> <p>First, an examination as to why the government views the UK's remaining resources of oil and gas so pessimistically that it forecasts a 35% production decline by 2010 and 75% by 2020 - only about 16bn barrels of oil equivalent. Even the cautious estimates of oil companies suggest at least as many resources remain to be exploited as have been produced to date - 33bn barrels. Dr J Munns, a senior geoscientist at the Department of Trade and Industry, estimates there could be up to 47bn barrels of oil equivalent under the UK's North Sea section, most of which remains under-explored. </p> <p>Second, an evaluation of the failure of the present antiquated discretionary concession system and its associated tax regime to ensure a continuity of exploration for, and exploitation of the UK's offshore hydrocarbons. </p> <p>Third, consideration of other ways of exploiting remaining hydrocarbon resources, such as production-sharing agreements between a publicly owned entity - say, a strategic oil and gas authority - and companies. State investments in exploration and exploitation usually require a lower rate of return than those expected by the private sector, reducing the financial risk and enhancing production potential. </p> <p>Fourth, a comparison of Norwegian state involvement in the exploitation of that country's hydrocarbon wealth with Britain's essentially reactive approach to oil and gas development. In the latter case, the effective decision-takers are the concessionary companies, demonstrated by the recent partial withdrawal of BP and Shell from commitments to the UK's upstream hydrocarbon activities in order to finance operations elsewhere in the world. </p> <p>Fifth, consideration of the need for an entity independent of the producers for ensuring the timely development of optimal offshore pipeline networks to collect and deliver the oil and gas to markets, as with the recently formed, state-owned Norwegian company, Gassco AS. </p> <p>Sixth, analysis of the degree to which actions by the regulator Ofgem to enhance competition in gas and electricity markets have discouraged investments in upstream gas developments. </p> <p>More intensive exploitation of the UK's remaining resources of oil and gas will not even be at odds with the government's desire to move the country towards a \"low carbon economy\". The additional domestic hydrocarbons production will significantly reduce the country's high-cost imports of oil, gas and coal at a time when there are only limited possibilities of switching to renewable energy. </p> <p>The creation of additional national income through full exploitation of hydrocarbon resources seems the only way to sustain the subsidies required for the establishment of a low-carbon economy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Odell is author of Why Carbon Fuels will Dominate the 21st Century's Global Energy Economy </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter@odell.u-net.com\">peter@odell.u-net.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Winckless and Elise Laverick won bronze in the women's double sculls after a charge in the second half of the race pushed them into the medals. </p> <p>They had started strongly and were pushing for second place early on before slipping back as the dangerous New Zealand twins Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell - the eventual winners - took charge. </p> <p>At 500m Britain lay fourth, 2.2 seconds down and were over five seconds off the leading pace at half-way - but perfectly placed for a charge into the medal places. A powerful third quarter then carried Winckless and Laverick past the Bulgarians and into third place. </p> <p>They had over two seconds to make up on Germany in the final 500m to snatch silver and could not manage it, but finished a comfortable third to follow Grainger and Bishop in winning a medal for Britain.</p> <p>Winckless revealed she was stunned by their bronze medal success. \"It is going to take a while to sink in. I didn't know where we were until we crossed the line,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I think [if someone had told us we would have an Olympic medal] our reaction would have been disbelief. We have worked really, really hard and we are standing here because of our support staff. We've tried to match Cath and Katherine but we're really pleased for us and for them.\" </p> <p>Laverick admitted once they had surged into third place they had their sights set on overhauling the Germans and believed they could take silver. </p> <p>\"When we went through Bulgaria we were a little disappointed we couldn't maintain that push,\" she said. \"We just put in our fastest third of the race and the wheels came off in the last 250metres and we didn't get back on terms.\" </p> <p>Laverick said the success of Grainger and Bishop had filtered down to them while they were warming up but they had tried to shut out all other distractions. </p> <p>\"We heard the commentary from the other race but we were just trying to concentrate on our own boat,\" she added. \"We wanted to focus on what we could do and what we could control.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are a number of stock things grown adults tend to regret. Most wish they had carried on playing a musical instrument. A good few spend endless hours on Friends Reunited, wistfully rolling their mouse over schoolday crushes they never had the guts to pursue. Almost all - and this might sound like a dangerously sweeping statement, but honestly, it's true - wish that they could speak another language at least half decently.</p> <p>That's why evening classes are chock-full with stuttering grown-ups muddling through elementary Italian; and why the Costa Brava is overflowing with ex-pat Brits living cheek-by-jowl in English-speaking ghettos, too afraid to mingle with the locals.</p> <p>So save yourself the indelicacy and frustration of being a middle-aged monoglot and bite the bullet. Universities offer all manner of language courses, from Spanish to Sanskrit, many of which go into Clearing and all of which are ripe for the picking.</p> <p>Almost all degrees with a foreign language component take four years instead of the usual three because of the compulsory year abroad. In Scotland, where standard undergraduate degrees last for four years anyway, it either takes four as normal (eg at Edinburgh University) or a fairly hefty half decade (eg at Glasgow University). An increasing majority of students plump for combination or joint degrees, teaming one language either with another, or with another, totally unrelated subject.</p> <p>But why study languages when you could be toiling away over mathematic equations, breaking your brain trying to remember legalese or gnawing your nails over medical vivas? Well, it's obvious. Quite apart from becoming the envy of all your monolingual mates, having languages at your fingertips opens doors. It might not be the definitive key to a lucrative and fulfilling career, but it'll oil the joints on the way there.</p> <p>My first paid assignment for this newspaper came as a direct result of my language skills. While on my year abroad from university in Berlin, I found myself tangled up in a student demonstration that had catastrophic ramifications for the whole German higher education system. Uber-keen ears pricked up at a potential exclusive, I spontaneously interviewed marchers, academics and students (in German), pitched a piece to the newsdesk and landed myself with a tidy 1,000-word commission, to be delivered the next day. One year on, and recently graduated, I am now a professional journalist.</p> <p>Another thing you should bear in mind: no matter how good your intentions, you simply will not be able to keep up your language skills post-A-level (or indeed post-GCSE) without topping them up with either regular periods working or living abroad, or by studying languages.</p> <p>For some language graduates there isn't one specific, eureka moment where it all makes sense, but rather a general sense of horizons opening gradually as a result of being fluent in another tongue. </p> <p>Olaf Furniss graduated with a degree in translation from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Since gaining the necessary letters after his name, he has used his language skills in all kinds of jobs, including being an international adviser to various music events and to the editor of an international music industry magazine. He reckons that doing languages is definitely worth it - if only for the fabulous compulsory year abroad.</p> <p>\"I spent most of my year in Mexico, which totally changed the course of my life,\" he says. \"It was massively enlightening; I did a stint on the Mexico City Times and I can honestly say the work I did there was probably the stuff I'm most proud of writing ever.\" He adds: \"I certainly think I'm more employable because of my language skills, but unfortunately because in this country we are so monolingual, you don't always get credit for it.\"</p> <p>Language skills do, unfortunately, tend to be underrated, or even berated. Often being linguistically gifted isn't a means to an end, but rather a helpful bonus on the way to getting to where you want to be. The UK is now so short of language teachers that it is offering a \u00a34,000 \"golden hello\" to any PCGE-toting graduates who go on to teach these priority subjects. That is in addition to the \u00a36,000 tax-free training bursary available to most trainees on any postgraduate initial teacher training course. </p> <p>Vicky Smith, 22, graduated this year with a joint degree in French, German and European studies from Bath University. She's currently weighing up whether to become a teacher, lured in no small part by the cash incentive. Not that becoming a teacher was foremost on her mind: \"I fought against it,\" she admits. \"I was so sick of people with no imagination saying 'oh, you do languages, do you want to be a teacher, then?' that I was determined to do something else.</p> <p>\"But then I did a teaching assistantship on my year abroad in Saarland and realised that I loved the human contact that came with teaching. It was so satisfying. It was only when I found myself filling in job applications to become a translator that I suddenly realised that I wanted to do something active, something varied, that allowed me to use my languages.\" </p> <p>Christopher Harte graduated in 2000 with a degree in modern European languages from Durham University. He was in the first batch of new teachers greeted with the \u00a34,000 hello. Now, still only 26, he has recently won the Teacher Training Agency award for outstanding new teacher in the north-east, in the regional Teaching Awards, for his work as a French and Spanish teacher at St Robert of Newminster school in Sunderland. \"At a university like Durham lots of people go straight into management consultancy, accountancy and such, but I wanted to go in a different direction,\" he says, pointing to his year abroad as a teaching assistant in a Marseille Lyc\u00e9e as catalyst for this decision.</p> <p>\"I wanted human interaction, and I find teaching so rewarding. It was when my first set of results came through that I realised how much I enjoy the job, when kids who I knew would normally get Ds came out with Cs.\" </p> <p>Francesca Martin graduated last year with a degree in French and Russian from Nottingham University and recently landed herself a job working for a bank in Switzerland. \"Without my languages I would never have got here,\" she says. \"Languages open doors which might otherwise be closed.\"</p> <p>Language ability really can give you a competitive edge, a well earned leg-up in the crowded global economy. Linguistic talent can really be the clincher in the war for eye-catching CVs, as employment agencies such as Euro London, which is where Francesca nabbed her job, can no doubt testify. What's more, by connecting with other cultures you cannot help but improve your inter-personal people skills, while building on your analytic and interpretive capabilities.</p> <p>Plus you will be doing your bit to counteract the negative impression many of our neighbours have of our fair isle. Stereotypes stick, after all. If you really want to get ahead in the big bad world of Life, Careers and Stuff, you can't go far wrong studying one of the trickier languages such as Chinese, Japanese or Arabic. Fancy yourself as a spy? Well, MI6 are always on the lookout for bright graduates, and linguistic proficiency in the so-called difficult languages is certainly a positive. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office says: \"It would certainly be to a candidate's advantage to show the ability to learn a difficult language, such as Arabic, Hindu, Chinese, Russian or Pushtu [which is the primary language spoken in Afghanistan]. There's this false impression of the British secret services being dominated by white, Oxbridge-educated males, but we're looking for people from a much wider background - especially those who have grown up speaking a different language at home.\" So there is really no excuse not to run the language gauntlet. Then when you're old and grey you can sing along knowingly to \"je ne regrette rien\" - and, if you have a French degree, you'll even understand the grammar.<br> </p> <p><strong>Case study</strong></p> <p><strong>\"You have to choose a subject you like</strong><br></p> <p>Robert Benson (pictured), 21, is studying languages with professional studies at Leeds Metropolitan University<br></p> <p>\"I was predicted two Bs and a C for my A-levels, but I didn't work very hard. I didn't enjoy them and dropped out for a couple of weeks, but got talked into going back by my parents and my French teacher. I was convinced I was going to get three Us, but I ended up with two Es and a D. I was disappointed but at least I had three A-levels. At one point I thought I was going to get nothing out of the two years.</p> <p>I phoned Manchester Met, who said I could do French as long as I started straight away. I wasn't ready to do that - I wanted to have a year out working and travelling with friends. After a bit of persuasion, and with the help of a reference from my French teacher, Leeds Met said they would take me after my gap year.</p> <p>French is the only thing I was really good at at school. Everyone had told me it was important to choose a subject you enjoyed, so I chose French along with beginner's Spanish. I'm also doing marketing.</p> <p>I'd say I'm doing OK: my head is above water. I need to be a bit more organised. There are only about 20 people on my language course, so I know my tutors on a very personal level. It's really good because I can talk to them about any problems. I'm very fortunate.</p> <p>The only downside is that each semester we do a module in marketing, which is part of the professional studies course, and the module isn't linked to the language you're studying. It means language students are treated as normal professional studies students, which can be quite difficult. The highlight for me has been when a group of French students came over from Dijon for a couple of months on an exchange. Every week for an hour we chatted with them: half an hour in English and half an hour in French. I've just finished my second year and I'm starting to get to grips with Spanish.

  "<p><strong>Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender and Sexuality in Nature and in People</strong><br>by Joan Roughgarden<br>474pp, University of California Press, \u00a318.95</p> <p>The second question most parents ask of their new-born baby, once its intactness is assured, is ostensibly about sex - is the child a boy or a girl. But sex, to say nothing of sexuality, sexual orientation or gender, turns out to be a bit more complicated than just possessing XX or XY chromosomes, or for that matter an identifiable vagina or penis at birth. The starting point is indeed the chromosomal difference, with its resultant differential partitioning of genes - and genetic risks. But a whole lot more happens during development, both in utero and in the new-born.</p> <p>Despite their mythic status as \"male\" and \"female\" hormones, testosterone and oestrogen are present in both men and women, but generally in rather different proportions. Male and female brains differ, ever so slightly, but in particular in the presence of receptors for these hormones. A simplistic version is that all brains start female, but during development a testosterone surge \"masculinises\" the female brain. Above and beyond all this hormonal interplay there are the huge range of parental interactions, cultural expectations and pressures, that in our society serve to turn males and females into \"normal\" men and women.</p> <p>There's a problem with that word normal. It has a statistical meaning - that's how most people are - and a normative implication. If you aren't within the normal range, you are in a sense abnormal, and may be pitied, medicalised, ostracised or criminalised. But over the past decades, at least in western societies, the bounds of acceptable normality have steadily widened, to allow for other sexual orientations, from bisexuality and homosexuality to transgendering. Despite this new acceptance, however, there has been an assumption that these deviations from the norm (statistically speaking, that is) are primarily the results of cultural impositions laid over some \"natural\" biology.</p> <p>Joan Roughgarden, an ecologist, and also, as she proudly affirms within the opening pages of Evolution's Rainbow, a transgendered person, sets out to challenge these beliefs. She draws on a huge range of animal studies to insist on the diversity of forms of sexual activity in nature, and in doing so challenges a number of the key assumptions of neo-Darwinism. In species ranging from fruit flies to lizards and primates she finds behaviours that include multiple sexes, sexual switching between male and female, same-sex sexual play and much else besides. Parents who believe that sex education for their children means telling them about the birds and the bees may inadvertently have been preparing their offspring for more varied sexual adventures than ever crossed their minds.</p> <p>Darwin had long puzzled about the evolutionary significance of such striking aspects of animal appearance as, for instance, the peacock's gorgeous tail. Natural selection theory is based on the proposition that those animals best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive to reproduce in their turn, transmitting these better-adapted features to their offspring. But it is hard to see what adaptive function the peacock's tail fulfils. So, he argued, there might be a second form of selection, based on female choice. If females preferred the most beautiful (to Darwin) or at least the most conspicuous, feature of their mates, then males should compete to produce such features, leading to steady evolutionary change - sexual selection.</p> <p>Present-day biologists tend to discard Darwin's notion of beauty but argue that a glorious tail is an indication that its owner possesses \"good\" genes and is therefore a desirable mate. The trouble with sexual selection theory is that while it seems theoretically compelling, the empirical evidence for such unidirectional female choice - even among peacocks - is weak. A neat example of the problem is provided by red deer. While heavily antlered stags exhaust themselves by rutting, some females slope off to have sex with less rumbustious males - a strategy the late, great evolutionist John Maynard Smith memorably called \"sneaky fuckers\".</p> <p>Roughgarden finds sexual theory unsatisfactory both as a biologist and as a transgendered person, and proposes instead what she calls \"social selection\", in which the capacity for effective social interaction, lubricated by sexual play among and between the sexes, is the driver. I find this no less - but no more - compelling a theory than sexual selection, at least for social species. Yet despite her insistence that she is disproving Darwin, I doubt that he would have minded this addition to his theory - he was, as he continually reminded his readers, a pluralist.</p> <p>A second great problem for evolutionary theory is why there are only two sexes and a more or less 50/50 ratio of males to females - unnecessary granted the different roles each sex plays in reproduction, as many fewer males would seem to be required. Maynard Smith devoted many pages of argument and maths to prove that this was an optimal sex ratio. Roughgarden's varied examples suggest that he need not have bothered. There are many more forms of sex in nature than are dreamed of in this philosophy.</p> <p>So far, so good, but Roughgarden goes much further. Some years ago I watched with interest as a distinguished ethologist, herself a lesbian, followed the pair-bonding of the birds in her aviary to see if she could identify \"gay\" relationships. There's a danger of essentialism here, an argument that if it is present in nature it must be OK in humans. Both my lesbian friend and Roughgarden would deny this charge emphatically, but it does seem to shine through her writing. The problem arises in the opening few pages. The word gender has, I realise, multiple meanings, but it seems to me that it must be above all relational and refer to humans.</p> <p>There has been a worrying tendency in biological research papers recently to use gender as if it were a politically correct term for sex (as in \"rats of both genders were sacrificed...\"). Roughgarden takes it further. \"Gender,\" she says, is \"the appearance, behaviour and life history of a sexed body\". This enables her happily to anthropomorphise the animals she studies. Birds can be \"gay\" or \"lesbian\". They have \"husbands\" who may \"cheat\" and whom they can \"divorce\", while males can become \"widowers\".</p> <p>A long campaign was waged, notably by feminists, to drive such terms as \"rape\" and \"harem\" out of the animal behaviour literature, and it disturbs me to see it creeping back in. It is not just bad politics, it is bad science, as such relational terms only have meaning in a human social context, and it is wrong to impose them on other species.</p> <p>The non-human world occupies only a portion of Evolution's Rainbow. Having naturalised transgendering, Roughgarden turns to a sort of Cook's tour of transsexuals in history and across cultures, before offering a manifesto for a curriculum and social policy that provides for gender justice. I have no real problems with much of this, though I take the view that there are rather more pressing problems of social injustice to confront (at least outside the more privileged strata of Californian society). As a persistent theme through the book is that to be transgendered or homosexual gives one a privileged voice in both science and policy related to sex and gender, Roughgarden's response would probably be that, as a straight man, I would, wouldn't I?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Steven Rose's new book, The 21st Century Brain, will be published early next year</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture</strong><br>810pp, Phaidon, \u00a3100</p> <p>A real atlas of what is being built in the world today would be a confounding thing - a Domesday Book of cheapness, pretension and making do. This vast Phaidon atlas is something different: a gazetteer of all that is most inventive, inspiring and humane in the architecture of the past five years. Itself beautifully and thoughtfully designed, it leaves one with a heady reassurance that architecture, so essential and ubiquitous, and often so banal, is still at its best a transforming medium, giving meaning as it gives delight.</p> <p>The atlas circles the globe, from the deserts of Western Australia to the vineyards of southern Chile, taking in 1,052 buildings on the way. Each is given at least half a page, most a full page, and a spectacular few (such as Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Hall in LA or Future Systems' groovy Birmingham Selfridges) are awarded a two-page spread. Each receives a succinct write-up: some of these a little stiff with theory; others, it must be said, based almost verbatim on promotional literature put out by the architects themselves. Anonymity prevails (the book doesn't even admit to an editor), and the brief preface describes the process but not the principles of selection. There is a certain inscrutability, therefore, about the project, despite its openness and inquisitiveness.</p> <p>Overall the book is a celebration, and it is only rarely that a building is even admitted to be controversial. The judgments are made tacitly, by omission, so that Michael Hopkins's new Westminster tube station gets in, but not his hugely conspicuous Portcullis House above it - the space going instead to a bandstand in Bexhill-on-Sea. Many of the buildings covered are astoundingly big, but the charm of the book lies in its insistence on imagination over mere self-assertion, so that as well as visiting the stupendous Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur (1,483 feet high), we spend quality time in a Dutch bus shelter and a sauna in Duluth. Two of the most appealing buildings are public lavatories, one fitted into the old fabric of Dubrovnik, the other a piece of radical \"springtecture\" by Shuhei Endo, an uncoiling twirl of corrugated aluminium half-buried in a Japanese hillside.</p> <p>It is an interesting game to open the book at random and see if you can tell from the pictures which country, or even which continent, a building exists in. Now and then there's a palm tree or glacier to help, and in certain places, such as India or Norway, landscape and building traditions combine to produce something distinctly indigenous. But in general you come to see that the atlas is justly named, and that world architecture really exists. It is not, like world music, a folk-based phenomenon. On the contrary, it is part of the long declension of high modernism, and it is an orthodoxy that is genuinely global. The same language of forms and (since the history of architecture is intimate with the history of technology) the same materials recur across the world.</p> <p>If the modernist box remains the default form, unsurpassable for its elegance and adaptability, it has also been the spur to some amazingly bold escapes from that orthodoxy. Ten or 15 years ago, this would have been a very different book, full of the referential jokiness of postmodernism. Few styles can have dated so quickly or so comprehensively. Here it is remembered only occasionally - as in Venturi Scott Brown's Toulouse Capitol Building, with its vestigial pediments and porticos.</p> <p>It has been succeeded by something more radical in its wit. Gehry continues to design in monumental free-form curves, using every angle except a right one. In his building for a management school in Cleveland, Ohio, writhing stainless-steel-clad forms erupt from a square redbrick block, which buckles and melts beneath them. In his waterfront development in D\u00fcsseldorf, the warped forms themselves resemble reflections in water, the 1,600 windows all skewed at different angles. In London the once formidably cuboidal Norman Foster has designed two beautiful buildings, the Swiss Re tower and City Hall, entirely out of curves; they combine advanced ecological programming with a formal elan one could not have predicted 10 years ago. City Hall's great spiral ramp, which leans back on its curving axis as it rises from basement to roof, has the sublimity and spacial daring of a late baroque master such as Borromini.</p> <p>The materials employed are wonderful to list. On the one hand there are new ones such as ETFE (ethyltetrafluorethylene), of which the geodesic domes of Nicholas Grimshaw's Eden Project are made, and which has less than 1% of the mass of glass, making possible a structure of unprecedented lightness. The airy daring of many large buildings by Foster, Calatrava and others depends on the novel engineering possibilities of lightweight tubular steel. In Frankfurt, Grimshaw has built the largest pillarless span in Europe, under a magnificent roof of conch-like undulations.</p> <p>More unconventional materials are used for smaller-scale projects: that Dutch bus-shelter is made of polystyrene foam and polyester. A more superficial novelty comes from claddings of pixelated graphic panels or the digitally printed laminate that covers a huge French gym in photographed (but not for a moment convincing) ivy. In Holland - where even functional buildings are treated with an imaginative boldness bordering on eccentricity - there is a heat transfer station with a polyurethane-clad \"climbing wall\" which spells out in braille \"The Blind Fa\u00e7ade\", and a \"Popcentrum\" with walls of glass mineral wool clad in black rubber.</p> <p>But there is another trend, in many parts of the world, towards the use of cheap, found and recycled materials. In Alabama the Rural School builds community projects on minimal budgets: an assembly hall out of rammed earth and old car windscreens; a house whose pretty, parti-coloured walls turn out to be made from stacks of carpet tiles. In Holland there's a pavilion of semi-translucent beer-crates. In Westcliff-on-Sea an after-school club is Europe's first cardboard building, made of 90% recycled materials and itself almost totally recyclable. Often these usages are inventive responses to necessity, but they have their own aesthetic. Sarah Wigglesworth's Straw Bale House in London has walls of bales and sandbags as sound insulation and also as a kind of ongoing bricolage, the improvisation of a house that is permanently incomplete.</p> <p>Political and economic currents run through the atlas, creating new vortices of activity and floods of expenditure. So Berlin takes on the functions of a capital, with its new embassies and new Reichstag (another Foster spiral); in Ljubljana such functions are combined with colourful attempts to undo the ravages of socialist modernism; in the Far East magnificent new airports are designed (so globalised is the profession) by Foster (Hong Kong), Terry Farrell (Seoul) and Paul Andreu (Shanghai). SOM's 88-storey Jin Mao tower in Shanghai, with its pagoda-like silhouette, is a vision of economic boom in the language of a fantasy book illustration.</p> <p>In this context there's not a lot about the re-use of old buildings, beyond a handful of museums and some striking Viennese gasometers turned into chic if noisy flats. But it's good to see attention given to the challenging work of the Beirut architect Bernard Khoury. He has designed a series of restaurants and nightclubs amid the dereliction and random commercial redevelopment of that city. \"Beirut is not being rebuilt,\" he says, and indeed only one Beirut building other than his is included in the atlas. Khoury's sumptuously hi-tech works - a restaurant inside an old warehouse shored up by a steel exoskeleton, a jazz club sunk in the site of a refugee settlement wiped out by Phalangist militia in 1976 - are disconcertingly ironic statements about the glamour and denial of pleasure-seeking. They remind us, too, of the loneliness of good architecture in a violent and fiercely commercial world.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alan Hollinghurst's novel The Line of Beauty is published by Picador</p>",
  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, yesterday dismissed investor scepticism over the advertising group's interest in rival Grey Global as he confirmed due diligence was being conducted on the US company. </p> <p>The announcement of a rise in first-half profits was overshadowed by the Grey situation, with Sir Martin dedicating much of the analysts' presentation to arguing the merits of a deal. The head of the world's second largest advertising group yesterday said WPP was \"continuing to noodle\" with a bid for Grey, which has also attracted interest from private equity firm Hellman and Friedman. Sir Martin added that Goldman Sachs, the investment bank overseeing the sale, had pushed back the deadline for a deal from this month to September. </p> <p>WPP has not tabled a bid but Sir Martin said Grey, the last major independent advertising company, was a good fit for WPP and cheap at a mooted price of around $1.3bn (\u00a3710m): \"The prices being talked about are about one times revenues, which is historically at the cheap end for these sorts of deals.\" </p> <p>He said concerns over Grey's margins, which at around 9% are four percent age points below WPP's, were also overblown. </p> <p>\"It depends whether you believe the profit margins can be improved or not. It is a question of whether you believe you can move them to 13% or 14%, where we are. There is nothing structurally different [with Grey] to the way we are and they work with the same clients,\" he said. </p> <p>Analysts have questioned the strategic rationale behind bidding for Grey, arguing that buying a US-based advertising firm jarred with WPP's stated intention of shifting the geographic mix of its businesses away from North America while building a stronger presence in more robust subsectors such as marketing services. Grey's main client is consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble, and other accounts include pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline and drinks company Diageo. </p> <p>Sir Martin said Grey was a diverse operation, with a healthcare business and an interactive unit among its assets. WPP's flagship brands are the J Walter Thompson and Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agencies, but advertising accounts for 46% of its turnover with the rest generated by its public relations, healthcare and consultancy divisions. </p> <p>\"In terms of strategy it does not move the dial one way or another. If we did it, it would be 11% of the combined group,\" said Sir Martin. </p> <p>Shareholders were not convinced and WPP's shares slipped 1.3% to 488p despite a set of results that were in line with expectations. Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis Securities, said a Grey takeover would not destabilise WPP but investors might balk if a deal is part-funded by a rights issue. The group cut debt by 26%, or \u00a3300m, to \u00a3853m in the first half of the year. </p> <p>\"The problem is that the market is very unfriendly at the moment. If you say Grey Global would cost in the region of $1.4bn there is a good chance half of it would be funded by debt and the rest by equity. It's not huge, but it's a cash call in a difficult market,\" he said. </p> <p>WPP yesterday said revenues in the six months to June 30 climbed 6% to \u00a32bn, while pretax profit rose from \u00a3153.6m to \u00a3176.3m. The group said it expected to hit its operating margin target of 13.8% this year, with the goal of 14.5% in 2005 and 15% in 2006. Sir Martin said the \"quadrennial effect\" of the US presidential elections, the Olympics and Euro 2004 would stimulate global advertising growth of 3% to 4% this year, slipping back to 2%-3% in 2005.</p>",
  "<p>What keeps the average pharmaceutical company executive awake at night? It is not threats from animal rights extremists but how much the industry can charge for its drugs in the United States. </p> <p>The US spends $230bn a year on drugs, almost half the world's total, according to research group IMS Health; the spend per head is three times that of the UK. </p> <p>Part of the reason is that Americans take more drugs. But mainly it is that European governments set drug prices; in the US, they can charge what they can get away with. </p> <p>Americans are finally complaining. The state of Illinois is planning to flout central US government rules and try to import drugs from British and Canadian wholesalers. </p> <p>The development threatens the economics of the drug giants. The industry usually justifies its prices by arguing that it costs $800m to bring a drug through research, development and regulatory approval. </p> <p>Europe, it says, is getting a free ride and leaving it to the US to pay for the world's drug costs. The pay-off is that firms, including the Europeans, invest more heavily in the US's impressive science base. </p> <p>Even so, the drug companies will have to explain some uncomfortable facts - like operating profit margins that are regularly over 30%. </p> <p>This, don't forget, is after paying for all that R&amp;D. If margins came down to, say, 20%, would they stop researching? Of course not. Even the supposedly penny-pinching UK government allows the companies to make a return on capital of a healthy 21%. Then there is the awkward fact that drugs firms are no longer centred on research. </p> <p>Stewart Adkins, a Lehman Brothers analyst, points out that the industry spends twice as much on salesmen as it does on R&amp;D. Increasingly, the firms resemble consumer goods companies. </p> <p>Illinois's action may not be the answer, but a backlash looks inevitable.<br> </p> <p><strong>Relax, don't do it</strong><br> </p> <p> As the oil price edges ever closer to $50 a barrel, global policymakers remain relaxed. This week John Taylor, a senior US treasury official, reckoned the global economy was basically in good shape. France's industry minister, Patrick Devedjian, believes European growth is not yet threatened. </p> <p>The International Monetary Fund appears to be cheerleading the bulls. Its managing director, Rodrigo Rato, is reported as expecting global growth at 4.6% this year and next. Germany's S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper says the IMF will raise its growth forecast in its autumn economic outlook to be published in September. </p> <p>So has the world economy decoupled itself from the oil price, or have some policymakers lost the plot? </p> <p>The case for the optimists is that while the supply/demand equation remains tight, it is still tight on the right side. What is pushing the price higher is speculation driven by political uncertainties over Iraq, in Russia and - until last weekend - in Venezuala. </p> <p>If supply takes a knock, the global economy could be in trouble. Cut out the uncertainties and the price will be back to more comfortable levels. </p> <p>The problem is that the uncertainties cannot just be shrugged off. As even the most hopeful acknowledge, if the oil price stays around these levels for any length of time then the pain will kick in. </p> <p>Growth may not be the first casualty. As oil-related energy costs rise so do companies' overall costs. They can take the hit on margins or they can seek to trim other costs, like people. The jobless figures may start showing the economic impact of higher oil before the GDP numbers.<br> </p> <p><strong>Glad to be Grey?</strong><br> </p> <p>WPP is an investment banker's dream - it pulled off 16 acquisitions last year and a further 12 since January. But the world's second largest advertising group is now mulling a takeover that, for shareholders, could be a deal too far.</p> <p>Those concerns were evident yesterday when chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell went public with his interest in US-based Grey and the shares dipped. Shareholders' concerns boil down to two questions: is Grey worth the suggested price of $1.3bn (\u00a3710m) and is it strategically imperative? </p> <p>On the first question, $1.3bn represents a multiple of one times annual turnover, and that's about right for an advertising firm with below-par margins such as Grey. With debt of \u00a3850m and annual cashflow of \u00a3450m, WPP can comfortably afford it. </p> <p>Sir Martin debated the merits of the deal at length yesterday. He needed to, because it is the issue that makes Grey such a hard sell. Grey's core market is the US - hardly a geographic weakness for WPP. </p> <p>If anything it is too much of a strength, and the group is trying to scale down its presence there. Procter &amp; Gamble is Grey's major client and it would be a big business win for WPP, but P&amp;G's Unilever just happens to be with WPP. </p> <p>Apparently Unilever has accepted assurances from Sir Martin that the addition of P&amp;G will not cause a problem. </p> <p>There are other strengths in Grey's business, such as its sales promotion unit and its healthcare business, but there is no doubt that this deal would be about old-fashioned advertising services and that is an area WPP is trying to diversify away from. </p> <p>Thus investors do not want WPP to chase down Grey at all costs. As one analyst said: \"It's not a must-do deal, it's a nice-to-do deal. So WPP had better get it at a nice-to-do price.\"</p>",
  "Canada's equivalent to Henry David Thoreau was Grey Owl, the Canadian Indian author of the 1930s (Comment, August 17). But in 1903-04 Grey Owl (real name Archie Belaney) was a white teenage middle-class neighbour of Robert Tressell in Hastings (Letters, August 18). Impoverished Tressell was living in a small flat in the road in which the well-off Belaney was attending the town's grammar school. <p>On that road they saw the same misery, poverty and corruption, but their backgrounds gave them different visions of the future. Tressell fought on the streets for a fairer industrial society, while Belaney went to the Canadian forests to campaign for pre-capitalist naturalism, re-creating himself as a native in the process. Today, both dreams retain their power, as Martin Kettle showed, but both are even less realisable under mega-capitalism and global warming. <br><b>Steve Peak </b><br> Hastings, E Sussex</p> <p>Thank you for Martin Kettle's inspiring article. My father gave me Tressell and I have had it by me ever since. I discovered Thoreau later and I take that down regularly to help me find directions for my life. However, I wouldn't be without either and they have helped to maintain my faith in human decency. Not on their own, of course; give me Blake, William Morris and a host of others but these are touchstones never to be abandoned. <br><b>Vernon Hale </b><br> Cardiff</p> <p>Like many readers, I have been following the Tressell and Thoreau debate with great interest. What is striking about both books is their capacity to inspire political passion and moral concern. Yet I think neither really connect with the times in which we live. Overwork and over-consumption are not really addressed by socialist nostalgia. And Thoreau's vision of a return to nature has little to say about our urban lives.</p> <p>To inspire us in our global, market-driven society, I suggest Jose Saramago's novel Blindness, with its central concern with the recovery of social solidarity.

  "With crude oil prices hitting an all-time high this week of more than $48 (\u00a326.30) a barrel and economists warning of a full-blown energy crisis, the US was in serious trouble, said David Ignatius in yesterday's <b>Washington Post</b>. The oil market was in \"a sort of inverse bubble, propelled by its own momentum of anxiety and bad news\", he wrote. <p>With the outlook bleak, Ignatius was disappointed by the lack of serious debate from George Bush and John Kerry. \"There's no sense, in either camp, that the country is facing a severe threat to its economy,\" he said. In their campaigns for the White House, both men were offering only \"platitudes\". \"Evidently [they] would rather play it safe and avoid politically controversial proposals, which in today's world is downright dangerous.\" </p> <p>Oil prices were being driven up by the \"continuing power struggle in Iraq, by fears for the solvency of the Russian oil giant Yukos, and by surging demand for oil in Asia\", explained Patrick Seale in <b>Gulf News</b>. But he felt optimistic about the way Mr Kerry was urging US industry to develop renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power. No one should underestimate the innovative powers of American industry, Seale said in the United Arab Emirates daily. \"Change is coming and the higher the oil price the faster it will come.\" </p> <p>There was a chance oil prices would remain high at least until the US presidential elections, said the Korean <b>JoongAng Ilbo</b>. But it called for the bigger picture to be addressed. \"To handle energy problems, a comprehensive longer-term strategy will have to be consistently pursued rather than temporary, short-term efforts.\" The <b>Scotsman</b> agreed. We need to relearn the lessons of the 1970s, it said: \"The west should diversify away from imported fossil fuels. [For Britain] that implies hard choices about the future of nuclear energy and more attention to incentives to exploit the remaining oil in the North Sea.\" </p> <p>The <b>Economist</b> refused to get flustered. \"Most economic models confirm that the recent rise in oil prices should have a relatively modest impact on output,\" it said. If prices stay at their current level, then one percentage-point might be wiped off global growth. \"That is not insignificant but so far not enough to trigger a global recession.\"</p>",
  "When things were really tough, David Kennard had the idea of making a video about his work - and The Year of the Working Sheepdog has since sold 60,000 copies. His book, A Shepherd's Watch was published earlier this year and he is already busy on the sequel. <p>\"67% of full-time farmers are diversifying. The average farm income is \u00a312,000 and most farmers work 85 hours a week. There are far too few youngsters coming in to it and that is probably the single biggest problem facing farming. 10,000 people are leaving farming every year,\" he says. </p> <p>David's farm is in north Devon and his working environment is something he loves, although he admits that it's better in good weather. </p> <p>\"The downside is the wind and rain. We catch the east and we catch the north. We're at the head of the Borough Valley in Exmoor and it's a hugely varied landscape. It's heavily wooded - 400ft deep - and it goes down to Lee Bay. The coast here is National Trust. </p> <p>\"Peregrine falcons come to this coast and we also have red kites. The gannets are my favourites: they drop out of the sky to fish.\" </p> <p>When David was on his farm holidays he was able to help out with lambing. \"Lambing then was dependent on a lot of children moving ewes and lambs here there and everywhere. When I was 15 I did a month on a sheep farm in Muck, then when I was 17 I left school and left home and did a youth training scheme on a farm in Kent.\" </p> <p>Today he has his own farm, although he doesn't own all 450 acres. \"I rent some, I own some and I tenant some.\" </p> <p>According to David, the quad bike is the biggest recent change in shepherding. \"They're invaluable. I used to have 450 sheep and 100 acres and you could walk around. But with 800 sheep and 450 acres it would take the whole day.\" </p> <p>He sometimes gets help from his children. \"Nick can fit two lambs in a toy tractor and Laura is brilliant at moving ewes and lambs around.\" </p> <p>And he has his dogs: Greg, Swift, Ernie and Fern. \"I tend to do dog training in the evening. Sometimes I can be out until half past ten.\" On Wednesday nights during August, he does sheepdog demonstrations for people on holiday in the area. A falconer also comes along to do a demonstration. </p> <p>He says he's a sheep farmer, rather than a shepherd. \"Shepherd tends to be the employee. But the skills I have are shepherding skills.\" The greatest skill, or asset of all is the elusive stockman's eye. </p> <p>\"It's all about having a stockman's eye. You can look at a flock of sheep and something that's different will just pop out at you. Just after lambing I had a dead ewe and I had to bring the lambs in. We had 250 lambs and 150 ewes but somehow I was able to identify which lamb was hers. I don't know how I knew. It's not something you can teach.\" </p> <p>When a lamb is brought in it has to be kept warm. \"But the Aga isn't the first port of call any more. Traditionally you had the the bottom door of the Aga but now it's hot boxes: a temperature controlled air blown floor.\" </p> <p>He loves his dogs and explains that sheepdog breeding is not unlike racehorse breeding. The dogs are kennelled but in winter he admits they would probably like to sneak into the house. </p> <p>\"I've got four good working dogs and two that are more or less retired.

  "<p>Norwich Union warned this week it will refuse to insure new homes put up on inadequately-protected floodplains, blocking buyers from obtaining a mortgage and calling into question key regeneration schemes such as John Prescott's Thames Gateway project. </p> <p>The insurer, which covers one in every five homes in Britain, is close to completing a new flood map of Britain developed using technology which singles out homes prone to flooding with precision not seen before. </p> <p>Until now insurers have used postcodes (which cover 20-30 homes) to assess flood risk but the new map will identify the exact position of each home and its height above sea level. </p> <p>Around 2m homes are in flood-prone areas such as Boscastle, devastated by a flash flood this week. The new map will identify those in line for sharp increases in premiums and excess levels, and those which may deserve a cut in charges. </p> <p>A typical home insurance policy has an \"excess\", meaning that the householder pays the first \u00a350 of any claim. But in areas defined as \"high risk\" - which Norwich Union says is where a flood happens more than once in 75 years - the excess could rise to \u00a31,000 or more. It has given a guarantee to existing customers it will not pull out of providing cover, but where it is approached by new customers, particularly for new-build homes on floodplains, it is likely to refuse. Jill Boulton, head of Norwich Union's flood mapping project, says: \"Where we find that a developer has not thought properly about flood protection, it's leaving their buyers and us in a very difficult position. In such situations we are not prepared to offer cover.\" </p> <p>The Office of Deputy Prime Minister is keen to press ahead with 90,000 new homes in the Thames Gateway area stretching along the estuary to the Essex and Kent coast. But, as currently proposed, most of the area is already below existing high-tide level, and well below the likely flood level of 2050. </p> <p>NU's Ms Boulton says: \"We appreciate the need to build new homes, but if they absolutely have to be built on floodplains, then it needs to be extremely carefully looked at. Concreting over fields for development is a key factor behind flash flooding.\" </p> <p>NU wants new-build homes to be more flood-resilient - which means electrical circuits and plug sockets located at knee rather than ankle level, and kitchen units put on three-inch spikes and made of wood rather than chipboard. Flood damaged homes can take up to a year to dry out, and the pollutants and bacteria in flood water means that plasterwork has to be stripped back to the bricks. </p> <p>NU acknowledges that the government has increased spending on defences, but Ms Boulton says that her inspection of recent work indicates that \"the defences built in 1100 and 1600 are still there, but the modern ones are already rotting\". </p> <p>She adds that water company drainage problems have also worsened and that billions may have to be spent to replace pipes. </p> <p>In October, the Environment Agency will release a new, highly-detailed flood map of Britain, which, unlike the NU map, will be available online at environment-agency.gov.uk. It also runs a flood hotline on 0845 988 1188. </p> <p>There is also some good news for people living in areas which are subject to regular flooding. </p> <p>Lewes in East Sussex hit the headlines in 2000 when it suffered extensive flooding, and it remains vulnerable. Before the new mapping techniques, insurers were refusing to offer cover to one in 10 homes in the town. </p> <p>But NU says it has been able to narrow that down to just 2%, because it can identify precise risk to each and every home in the area.</p>",
  "On the positive side, growth in US company profits has recently been stronger than at any time during the past 10 years. Although some cooling is expected as policy stimulus fades and higher energy costs and interest rates affect the economy, nevertheless, there is a more robust environment for economic growth and business confidence has increased. <p>But the main negatives for UK investors are market val uations and the weak dollar. By some measures, market valuations are stretched, offering little hope that a sustainable bull run would kick off from these levels. </p> <p>And it seems unlikely that the bear market in the dollar will be reversed in the short term.

  "It is one of the great cliches of our time. Globalisation has made the world interdependent to an extent never imagined in the past. We now enjoy, it is suggested, a new kind of knowledge and intimacy with the world. We live in a global village. We are all cosmopolitans now: we can eat food from all over the world, mix with people of many races, communicate far and wide via email or cheap calls. <p>Yet in this global era, Britain grows seemingly ever more provincial. Of course, it was always true that mainstream culture has been largely parochial - it is probably the case more or less everywhere. There was never much foreign news in the tabloids, though there is even less now. But the same trend is evident in the broadsheets. There may be more correspondents based in the US, but virtually everywhere else there are fewer. Foreign news, we are told, does not sell: people, in other words, are not interested. </p> <p>An even more disturbing trend can be seen in television. ITV has all but abandoned any commitment to serious foreign coverage; Granada's This Week is now a fond but distant memory. BBC1 has more or less given up on current affairs, certainly of the foreign kind, while, in less than a decade - coinciding more or less with all the talk about globalisation - BBC2's foreign coverage has contracted and been shunted into the graveyard hours. The Independent Television Commission reported in 2002 that current affairs on terrestrial channels had been cut by 50%: foreign coverage was the worst casualty. All this, of course, is in the pursuit of audience figures: clearly the viewers are less and less interested in what is happening beyond these shores. And little in the way of compensation can be found in the myriad satellite channels. </p> <p>It is true that there has been an explosion of lifestyle programmes about foreign countries: buying a villa in France or Spain, setting up a business in sunnier climes ... the programmes seem inexhaustible. And there are travel programmes galore. One expression of globalisation, indeed, is the huge expansion in tourism. But tourism - except at the most superficial level or at the most distant margins - has not fostered a greater knowledge of the world. The favourite destination is a beach in the sun, or skiing in the winter. Most package holidays will segregate you from other nationalities and inure you from everything except the lightest of brushes with the local culture. </p> <p>The favourite long-haul destinations for white Britons are primarily those of the white diaspora - north America, Australia and New Zealand: you travel halfway round the world to feel comfortable with your own kith and kin. And even when people are a little bolder and travel, for example, to south-east Asia, it is almost invariably to a resort (and hotel) that caters primarily for western tourists: they while away their time in a western-style bubble, a white tourist micro-colony. They may see some sites, but they never mingle with, let alone get to know, the people. Tourism may be a way of seeing the world, but rarely of encountering it, and almost never of understanding it. </p> <p>You might expect, in a world of increasing globalisation, that there would be a growing premium on learning foreign languages. In fact, for the British, the opposite is the case. Fewer and fewer people are learning foreign languages. And from this September, learning a foreign language will no longer be compulsory for school students between the ages of 14 and 16. We have long been a monolingual culture: now, in the global era, we seem to be celebrating our insularity and ignorance. Not even the growing diversity of mother tongues in our ranks - Urdu and Hindi, perhaps most obviously - have persuaded us to be more cosmopolitan and learn other cultures' languages. It would not only help us to understand our fellow citizens better, and to value what they bring us, it would also give us a new intimacy with, and understanding of, south Asia, a subcontinent in the ascendant. </p> <p>The oft-cited reason is that we don't need to learn other languages, because English is the new lingua franca. But English can only ever be an interlocutor language; if you can't speak the language of other peoples - be it Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin or Arabic - you can never understand their culture: language is not just a collection of words, it embodies the concepts and relationships of another culture, a different way of seeing the world, a different way of being. As our importance in the world fades, we are becoming even less interested in communicating with and understanding others, just when those others are set to matter a lot more. The decline in the ability or willingness to learn other tongues is another example of our growing parochialism. </p> <p>The rise of globalisation has not been accompanied by a new cosmopolitanism. Britain is a more parochial and provincial place than it used to be. It would be reasonable to expect the opposite to be the case. How do we account for this? </p> <p>One explanation is specifically British. For well over 200 years, Britain was the centre of a huge empire, which at its peak covered a quarter of the world's land surface. Overseas expansion and the ability to command the seas, to conquer other peoples and then to run colonies require a sophisticated knowledge of the world, an officer class that is well-versed in the ways of the world, newspapers that can inform, universities that can train, a culture that can sustain. </p> <p>The hub of an empire has to be a cosmopolitan place. But as the empire contracted, as Britain's role in the world diminished - at extraordinary speed, it must be said - the need for such knowledge and capacity declined. The great institutions of empire - Foreign Office, Navy, Indian civil service and the rest - either no longer exist or are a shadow of what they were. All we are left with is the memory, some of the hubris, the pomp without the circumstance. </p> <p>We still like to consider ourselves a global player, but in reality we are not: our pretensions are now more like pastiche, substance has been replaced by vacuity, grandeur has given way to self-absorption, historical destiny to an obsession with celebrity. Post-imperial Britain has become deeply parochial - yet we remain almost utterly oblivious of the fact (the liberal elite included). </p> <p>But the reasons for our provincialism are not only national. Perhaps the era of globalisation has itself engendered a more general kind of retreat from the world into the land of the familiar. The cold war was a world that we knew, that made sense - countries fitted into a pattern, we knew which side they were on, we were partisan about them, the historical narratives of left and right provided us with a sense of order and objective. The left, for its part, had a global mission: it was intimately interested in the world, it was cosmopolitan. </p> <p>But the old order has been superseded by a world that is inchoate and chaotic, whose rules we no longer know, whose future seems complex and indeterminate. So we retreat into ourselves, we turn our backs on the unfamiliar, we become self-absorbed; parochialism dominates our psyche. Not only us but, one suspects, many other countries, not just in Europe - though, given its history, Europe especially. Parochialism, at least for now, is the flipside of globalisation. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Martin Jacques is a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics Asia Research Centre </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martinjacques1@aol.com\">martinjacques1@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>What do media bosses Richard Desmond and Kelvin MacKenzie have in common with City maverick Terry Smith and the former chairman of the Football League, Keith Harris? The answer, apart from regular appearances in national newspapers, is Ian Rosenblatt.</p> <p>All four men have used the lawyer's services when working on some of their bestknown corporate manoeuvres. When Kelvin MacKenzie decided to sue Rajar, the radio audience research body, for what he claims is \u00a366m, he used Rosenblatt. Ditto the owner of Express newspapers when he wanted to sell off his porn magazine business earlier this year. </p> <p>The 45-year-old head of law firm Rosenblatts is also acting for Terry Smith's financial firm, Collins Stewart Tullett, in its fight against James Middleweek, the former employee who accused the firm of insider trading and other regulatory breeches. This week, the Financial Services Authority dropped its year-long inquiry into the allegations. However, the battle with Middleweek is set to go to court next year, and Smith is also in a legal tussle with the Financial Times, which reported the allegations. </p> <p>Recently Rosenblatt helped old friend Keith Harris take over Seymour Pierce's investment banking business. </p> <p>Rosenblatt, whose white shirt and serious glasses make him look every inch the corporate lawyer, says such high-profile clients make up about 30% of his business. He is the first to recognise that their contribution to Rosenblatts' type of one-stop shop for legal services, such as insolvency as well as litigation, goes much deeper. </p> <p>\"You're interested in talking to me because I have funny clients,\" he says to the Guardian, before correcting funny to \"interesting\". </p> <p>For his best-known clients also share a reputation for being somewhat interesting to work with. Few media bosses goosestep around business meetings the way Desmond did in a meeting with the Telegraph. Nor do many enjoy MacKenzie's reputation for \"Gotcha\" headlines. </p> <p><strong>Taste for drama</strong><br> What is it like to work for these men? Rosenblatt denies they are difficult. \"I don't necessarily see them as difficult people,\" he says. \"Fundamentally they are all human beings. Lots of so-called difficult people are just in a very difficult job.\" </p> <p>\"They are very straightforward people to deal with and tend to have massive amounts of energy. </p> <p>\"Anyway, I wake up in the morning thinking it's better to be doing this than conveyancing in Reigate.\" Besides, he adds, \"They're not necessarily the same publicly as the image they portray.\" </p> <p>What are they like in private, then? Rosenblatt first met \"Dirty Desmond\", as he is known in some circles, 20 years ago. He describes him as \"amusing, kindhearted and extremely charitable. On a social level, he's quite good company\". He has also been quite a good client. Desmond recommended Rosenblatt to MacKenzie and is a friend of Smith's. Rosenblatt now shares a personal trainer with the combative Smith. </p> <p>MacKenzie says he switched from City law firm Olswang to Rosenblatt because they didn't return calls fast enough. \"I call at odd hours and he is always there. He is a good guy with a sense of humour,\" says MacKenzie. The former Sun editor recognises the toll such service has taken on Rosenblatt. \"He's had a number of wives ... I mean, I wouldn't want to be married to him.\" </p> <p>Rosenblatt says he has two other advantages over rivals. The first is that he gives as good as he gets, saying: \"They are not the kind of people who react to a sponge.\" </p> <p>MacKenzie agrees: \"He's not shy at coming forward. He gives good advice.\" </p> <p>Rosenblatt also understands what it takes to run a business as he set up his own firm. \"In a way, in a normal way relative to some of those people, I understand because I started my own firm,\" he says. </p> <p>The young Rosenblatt's decision to set up his own business came after he worked on a case that could be said to have given him a taste for drama. He was an ambitious twentysomething lawyer who \"happened to be in the office on a Saturday morning\" when he got a call that changed his life. </p> <p>The caller asked him if he could go down to Bow Street magistrates court to deal with a bail application. He arrived unshaven and wearing jeans to find himself in front of a media circus and acting for Lorrain Osman, the former chairman of a Malaysian bank accused of a $100m fraud. </p> <p>During the next two and a half years - during which Osman became the UK's longest-serving remand prisoner - Rosenblatt handled the banker's business affairs around the world as well as his extradition. </p> <p>\"It was a huge experience for me,\" he says, \"a really massive experience.\" His excitement is obvious even now, two decades later, when he describes one trip to Asia where he was met by bodyguards at the airport who followed him everywhere, even into the gents. What became known as the Carrian case involved a lawyer found dead in a swimming pool and a bank employee murdered in a banana plantation. </p> <p>He calls his selection to act for Osman a \"pure fluke\" and refuses to talk about any tensions it may have caused at his firm, Sheridans. Explaining how he carried on with the case, he says: \"I suppose I am - I was - very ambitious. I'm a very good lawyer, quite commercial and very energetic, and I was game.\" </p> <p>After the case finished, however, his career at Sheridans was over. \"When that was finished, life was a bit dull,\" he says. \"I'd had this autonomy and was doing my own thing. I was really unemployable. I thought the best thing to do would be to start a firm of my own.\" He was 29.</p> <p>His first break came from a family who have also attracted headlines. He was appointed by the Foulstons to act on their behalf against the now defunct financial services group, British and Commonwealth, and subsequently when they went on to run Brands Hatch. </p> <p>When pressed, Rosenblatt says his own family life has helped his dealings with combustible clients. His father was the youngest of 12 children who were all in the business together in Liverpool. \"They were always falling out with each other over business things. It was a fairly volatile environment,\" he says. \"Maybe because I have seen all that from an early age, I know what goes on; what it's like.\" </p> <p><strong>Passion for opera</strong><br> His brother and sister are lawyers, the latter a partner at his firm. He also meets a cousin for an early breakfast about three times a week to chat, mainly about opera. </p> <p>After spending an hour talking about his business and his clients, Rosenblatt is suddenly struck by the fact he hasn't mentioned opera. \"We haven't talked about the recital series,\" he says, seemingly aghast. \"It's the only worthwhile thing.\" </p> <p>He spends \u00a3250,000 of his own money a year on the Rosenblatt Recital Series, a monthly session for singers begun in 2000. \"It's massively loss-making but I like doing it a lot. It's my passion.\" </p> <p>The reception area in Rosenblatts' offices in Holborn, London, is festooned with posters for the series, as well as the mementoes of corporate deals and a leather punchball, which is occasionally used by clients. The ever-discreet Rosenblatt refuses to say which. </p> <p>Rosenblatt's boardroom comes replete with black leather chairs and crystal ashtrays. It seems perfect for Desmond, with his penchant for huge cigars. Rosenblatt denies this - the Express boss holds meetings in his own offices - as he sprays Jo Malone cologne to hide the smell of smoke. </p> <p>The man who squares up to some of scrappiest individuals in business then turns around, horrified. \"Do you have to write that?\" he asks. \"I don't want my mother to know I smoke.\"</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong><br> <strong> Born</strong> 1959 in Liverpool <br> <strong> Education</strong> Liverpool College; London School of Economics <br> <strong> Career</strong> After qualifying as a solicitor joined Sheridans Solictors, a music business law firm, in 1983, and was made a partner at the age of 26; founded Rosenblatt Solicitors, which now has 12 partners and a staff of 70, in 1989 <br> <strong> Family</strong> Divorced twice; three children <br> <strong> Leisure</strong> Opera and music; boxes twice a week and shares a personal trainer with Terry Smith</p>",
  "<p>Police were called in yesterday to investigate a suspected \u00a310m embezzlement fraud at manufacturing firm Charter, the rump of colonial conglomerate British South Africa Company, the group said yesterday. </p> <p>Evidence indicating a series of unauthorised payments totalling \u00a310m came to light on Thursday evening. Having investigated the matter through the night, Charter yesterday met investigators from Scotland Yard's fraud squad. </p> <p>The unnamed individual at the centre of the suspected fraud is understood to have left the company this week. Charter declined to say whether he had been sacked. </p> <p>In an statement to the stock exchange yesterday, it said: \"Investigations are at a preliminary stage and the precise nature and quantum of the suspected fraud, which appears at this stage to be confined to a single employee, are still to be determined.\" </p> <p>While initial evidence points to one individual, the company has not excluded the possibility of a conspiracy with others inside or outside the company. </p> <p>The case may yet be referred to the Serious Fraud Office. </p> <p>Discovery of the alleged fraud comes four months after the appointment of former KPMG accountant Robert Careless as finance director and recruitment of a new treasurer within his department. </p> <p>Moving to allay investors' worst fears, Charter said if it is unable to recover the embezzled money it is insured against employee malfeasance for up to\u00a35m. </p> <p>Yesterday Charter shares fell 19p to 156.5p. Guinness Peat Group, Jupiter Asset Management, UBS Global Asset Management and Sterling Investment Holdings each holds a stake of just over 10%. </p> <p>Three of them are said to have been influential in the appointment of David Gawler as chief executive in late 2000. He joined with a reputation as a turnaround expert, having worked at Sketchley and Trafalgar House. </p> <p>Once an huge manufacturing conglomerate operating under royal charter from Queen Victoria, Charter now has just two core businesses, welding and cutting equipment and gas handling equipment. </p> <p>Neither of the subsidiaries is thought to be directly implicated in the suspected fraud, which is believed to have taken place over a substantial time period within the finance department at Charter's head office in Grosvenor Gardens, south-west London. </p> <p>Among the many businesses spun off by Charter in recent years is Cape, the operation besieged with asbestos claims, which it sold in 1996. </p> <p>Cape last year was forced to pay \u00a37.5m to thousands of South African miners. Before the case was settled, the claimants tried to have Charter joined as a co-defendant. This was later dropped.</p>",
  "<p>Haile Gebrselassie said farewell to the Olympic Games last night with a performance that won him no place on the podium but earned an ovation that will live long in his mind. Twice a gold medal winner at 10,000 metres, the 31-year-old had the satisfaction of seeing two of his younger compatriots, Kenenisa Bekele and Sileshi Sihine, finish first and second while he took an honourable fifth place. </p> <p>For his final appearance at the games, the double champion came into the stadium at the rear of the file of 23 runners, smiling and waving to the crowd. Accepting a handshake from Dan Browne of the United States, he lined up close to Bekele, the 22-year-old whose exploits this season have given Ethiopia a new hero. A barley farmer's son who grew up in a village a few miles away from that of the great Derartu Tulu, Bekele started the season by breaking the world indoor 5,000m record in Birmingham before setting new world records at both 5,000 and 10,000m. </p> <p>The younger man hit the front from the start, with the 21-year-old Sihine on his shoulder and Gebrselassie in the middle of the pack. Dieudonn\u00e9 Disi of Rwanda, John Yuda and Fabiano Joseph of Tanzania, Moses Mosop of Kenya, Boniface Kiprop of Uganda and Zersenay Tadesse of Eritrea were others who forced their way to the front in an attempt to break the Ethiopian hegemony. </p> <p>Gebrselassie moved up to join the leading group with 17 of the 25 laps to go. For a period in mid-race the green-shirted trio circulated in isolation at the head of the field, to the glee of the flag-waving Ethiopian supporters clustered in the north-east corner of the stadium. With seven laps to go Gebrselassie fell back behind Bekele, Sihine and Kiprop, but Tadesse quickly towed the old champion back to the leaders. </p> <p>He clung on to the back of the group for a while, but the mirage was not to last. Soon he was dropping back again, leaving his team-mates to deal with the 22-year-old Tadesse while he trailed the 18-year-old Kiprop, this year's world junior champion. Tadesse had already been dropped when Bekele surged at the sound of the bell, sprinting away from Sihine as though they were just beginning a training sprint. Bekele covered the final lap in 53sec, completing the race in 27min 5.1sec, a new Olympic record but 45sec outside his world mark. </p> <p>This was the most significant stage in Gebrselassie's informal farewell tour. On July 30 he said goodbye to his British fans by winning a 5,000m at a packed Crystal Palace in a British all-comers' record time and basking in the warmth of a knowledgeable crowd. Last night the applause rang round Athens' magnificent new stadium. </p> <p>His two Olympic 10,000m victories in 1996 and 2000 put the Ethiopian on level terms with three of the greatest distance runners of the last century. The first was Paavo Nurmi, the Flying Finn, who won in 1920 and 1928 and would probably have made it four in 1924 and 1932 had he not been denied by the authorities. The second was Emil Zatopek, the great Czech who triumphed in London in 1948 and on the Finns' home turf four years later. And the third was another Finn, Lasse Viren, who fell and got up to win in 1972 and then again in 1976. </p> <p>But there was never a 10,000m race like the one in which Gebrselassie took his second title. The first had come in Atlanta, in a relatively straightforward victory over Paul Tergat of Kenya. By the time they reached Sydney, Gebrselassie had inflicted a similar fate on his friend Tergat at the world championships of 1997 and 1999. </p> <p>The occasion of his second win has gone down in history as the greatest night of athletics ever staged. Cathy Freeman's 400m victory would by itself have been enough for a crowd of 112,000 adoring Aussies. But they were also presented with Michael Johnson's unprecedented second 400m win, Jonathan Edwards's triple-jump victory, Maria Mutola's first gold medal in the 800m, and finally the most enthralling men's 10,000m race of all time, won by Gebrselassie from Tergat. The Kenyan led as they entered the final straight, but Gebrselassie inched closer with every stride and finally pushed ahead to take the verdict by 0.9sec, the vast stadium almost achieving lift-off as the crowd erupted. </p> <p>There was no such drama to marvel at last night, although Bekele's performance was that of a true champion. But the great man bowed out with dignity and the last flash in an Olympic arena of that unbreakable smile before he disappeared into the throng of adoring Ethiopians.</p>",
  "<p>Given that David Bentley has told Ars\u00e8ne Wenger he should be playing for Arsenal, it is hardly surprising that the young forward also believes the survival hopes of Norwich City, whom he joined on a season-long loan this summer, rest on his shoulders. \"If the team stays in the Premiership then a lot of that will probably be down to me,\" says Bentley. </p> <p>It is a bold statement for a player who has made only 10 first-team appearances in his career but equally it illustrates the remarkable confidence that Bentley exudes. He will take that self-belief with him for Norwich's second assignment in the Premiership this season - a daunting trip to Manchester United today. </p> <p>The 19-year-old, who has a five-year contract with Arsenal, came to prominence after his audacious chip left Middlesbrough's Mark Schwarzer clutching at thin air during an FA Cup tie in January. Comparisons with Dennis Bergkamp followed as Arsenal fans celebrated the arrival of a potential successor to the talismanic Dutchman. \"To get compared to Bergkamp, who is my hero, is brilliant but I'm my own player and I'm there to take his place,\" says Bentley, who made his Norwich debut against Palace last Saturday. </p> <p>However, if the goal against Middlesbrough awakened others to his ability, within the corridors of Highbury it has long been known that they have a potential gem, a rare breed of English player who can illuminate games with a flash of brilliance. Bentley is also acutely aware of his talent, so much so that on several occasions he has had the temerity to confront Wenger about his frustration at watching from the sidelines. </p> <p>\"He always wraps you up in cotton wool, especially when you are coming through as a youth player,\" he says of the Arsenal manager. \"I was having arguments and I used to go in to the office saying I want to go out on loan. For two years I have been saying this and finally this year I said: 'Look, next year, I'm playing - that's it.'\" </p> <p>The image of a slight 19-year-old, complete with Mohican haircut, issuing the estimable Wenger with an ultimatum is difficult to imagine. But there is something about Bentley's brazen manner that makes the whole episode utterly plausible. </p> <p>\"It was a bit of a comfort zone being at Arsenal,\" he says, running his hands through the more conventional hairstyle he has now adopted. \"I would sit on the bench and we would win and I would go on for 10 minutes and it would just be easy for me, but this is what learning football is all about,\" he adds, referring to his new environment at Norwich. \"The pressure will be on me to perform and that's what I am looking forward to.\" </p> <p>At Highbury the pressure and expectations would be greater. Is he ready to play for Arsenal now? \"Yes, I don't see any reason why not. I can play for Arsenal, I'm sure.\" </p> <p>Before Bentley makes that step he must convince Wenger that he can compete in the Premiership. Playing for Norwich every week rather than cameo roles for Arsenal will give him the perfect stage. The only danger is that the stage will become exactly that, somewhere for him to perform his party tricks. One of the few criticisms levelled at him is his propensity to overelaborate when in possession. </p> <p>\"That's lived with me since I started playing but hopefully it's entertaining for people to watch,\" he says, smiling. \"I know managers and spectators can get frustrated with that but at the end of the day people are paying to come into the ground and hopefully I can do something that they will remember. If everyone's a robot on the pitch it's going to be boring.\" </p> <p>Bentley, ostensibly, is anything but robotic. \"I want to play wherever I can get the ball,\" he says. \"If I'm not getting the ball on the left I'll go to the right. If I'm not getting it there I'll go up front.\" </p> <p>Fortunately Norwich's manager Nigel Worthington is aware of the teenager's ubiquity. \"I'm not going to nail him down to any one position,\" he says. </p> <p>Born in Peterborough, Bentley spent several years in Belgium through his father's job in the RAF, before moving to Enfield. And for all that the teenager hopes to achieve in Norfolk this season, north London, and more pertinently Highbury, remains home. The England Under-21 international does, though, admit he is \"slightly gutted\" that Premiership rules prevent him from facing his Arsenal team-mates when they visit Carrow Road next Saturday. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it is playing alongside and not against the likes of Robert Pires and Thierry Henry that is the ultimate objective for a player who joined Arsenal at the age of 11. Since Wenger arrived at Highbury in 1996, however, only Ashley Cole has progressed from the youth ranks to become a first-team regular. </p> <p>\"People always say this but maybe the players haven't been good enough to make it,\" says Bentley. \"Certain people just fall by the wayside. When they play they might not score a wonder goal, which you have to do. If you are unnoticed you don't deserve to be in the team.\" </p> <p>Bentley's performances for Arsenal have certainly not gone unnoticed.

He is undeterred. \"When I look back on this I will have spent a year enjoying myself at Norwich hopefully,\" he says. But such happiness is unlikely to be found unless Norwich survive in the Premiership, which, by his own admission, is where Bentley comes in.</p>"
