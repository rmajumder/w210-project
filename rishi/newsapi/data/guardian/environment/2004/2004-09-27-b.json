  "<p>J Sainsbury is likely to find itself in the grip of takeover speculation again today following reports that a leading private equity group is plotting a bid for the struggling supermarket chain. </p> <p>Permira, the venture capital firm that bid unsuccessfully for WH Smith and Debenhams in the last 12 months, refused to comment yesterday on reports it is seeking financial backers for an offer. </p> <p>Rumours that Sainsbury's could receive a takeover approach have been circulating for a couple of weeks, triggering heavy trading in its shares. Several names have been mentioned including GUS, the owner of Argos and Homebase, and entrepreneur Philip Green, who had an offer rejected by Sir Peter Davis, the supermarket group's former chief executive, last year. </p> <p>The shares fell sharply last week following strong half-year results from rival Tesco and warnings from City analysts that next month's trading update could be dire and prompt a profits warning. </p> <p>One retail analyst, Philip Dorgan of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, went as far as predicting that Sainsbury's will make as little as \u00a3200m profit this year, about half of what the City is expecting, and the dividend will be slashed. Sainsbury's shares closed on Friday at 262.75p, valuing the company at \u00a34.5bn. </p> <p>Crucial to any deal will be the founding Sainsbury family. Although they are no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the business, its members control about a third of the shares and no offer can be successful without their blessing. </p> <p>For a financial bidder such as Permira the attraction lies with Sainsbury's freehold property portfolio, which is valued on the books at \u00a36.5bn but could be worth as much as \u00a38bn. Someone like Permira would look to finance its offer by selling a large chunk of the portfolio and reposition Sainsbury's as a niche player alongside Waitrose. </p> <p>Whether the Sainsbury family would be prepared to back such a deal is open to question - although, if Justin King, Sainsbury's chief executive, is forced to cut the dividend, many analysts believe they would be willing to listen. </p> <p>Mr King delivers his review of the business on October 19 and is expected to be critical of Sir Peter, who secured a payoff of \u00a33.1m, and tell shareholders that the \u00a33bn spent on updating the group's stores, IT and distributions systems was not value for money.</p>",
  "<p>Cazenove has cut almost a fifth of its investment professionals in an effort to streamline its fund management business. </p> <p>The group, which is believed to be in talks about a joint venture with US investment bank JP Morgan, is trying to focus its fund management operation on equity investments in the UK and Europe, and bond markets. </p> <p>As a result, it shut down its global opportunities fund with the loss of six of the 34 professionals on its investment floor. The closure of its treasury management business meant the loss of a further two posts. </p> <p>The firm has also made cuts in its private client business, axing seven out of 40 jobs. </p> <p>Cazenove admitted that the private client job losses were part of a cost-cutting exercise but stressed that the posts cut in the fund management operation were part of a wider restructuring of the business. </p> <p>In total the fund management operation employs about 200 fund managers and support staff. </p> <p>The group is trying to focus its fund management business on a \"specialist\" model to concentrate on private clients, charities and targeting certain institutional clients in the mutual and pension fund arena under its chief executive, Andrew Ross. </p> <p>In the year to end-April, funds under management rose 19% to \u00a37.6bn. However, the operation is still much smaller than many of its peers. </p> <p>The wider Cazenove group - which ended its much-coveted partnership status in 2001 - is believed to be in talks about a joint venture with JP Morgan which would mark the end of its independence.</p>",
  "<p>A multi-million pound effort to persuade Britons to get serious about recycling is being launched today. </p> <p>With the UK still lagging far behind many other developed countries when it comes to managing waste, the government has spent \u00a340m to boost recycling rates and change attitudes to rubbish. </p> <p>A new ad campaign, fronted by the Olympic rowing champion Matthew Pinsent and comedian Eddie Izzard, will feature old cans, glass bottles and paper being transformed into new, everyday items through recycling. </p> <p>The government has warned that with a target of a quarter of all household waste being either composted or recycled by 2005-06, there are tough challenges ahead. Figures published last month show that two years ago, household recycling and composting had increased to 14.5%. </p> <p>The environment minister, Elliot Morley, said the new campaign would help to increase the recycling effort. </p> <p>\"Recycling is easier than it has ever been, and it is improving all the time,\" he said. \"Five years ago, kerbside collection schemes covered only 40% of homes. Today, more than two in three homes have kerbside collection schemes and there is an ever expanding network of 'bring' sites at your local supermarket and other convenient areas. </p> <p>\"We need to reduce the amount of waste we generate. It is time to stop thinking of waste as rubbish. So much of the waste we generate could be reused, recycled and transformed from a problem into an asset.\" </p> <p>A quarter of all emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas, comes from landfill sites. The government says less reliance on landfill and more attention to recycling will save resources and reduce the environmental impact. </p> <p>It is estimated that every tonne of glass recycled saves more than a tonne of raw materials. It also saves energy and means less quarrying, less damage to the countryside, and less pollution and global warming. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth has welcomed the campaign but says much more could be done.</p>",

  "\"I think politics is in an appalling state in this country, controlled by the media more than the electorate. There seems little difference between the parties in terms of policies.

  "<b>How do you feel about the Liberal Democrats in general? Are they a credible party of government? What are you hoping to see at the Labour and Conservative conferences?</b> <p>Return to your constituencies and prepare to be taken seriously. Sadly, the Liberal Democrats' new sense of political realism also saw not the demise, but the dilution of that idealism which is the province of the politically impotent.</p> <p>Delinquents will still be cuddled but with malice; Europe not quite so unequivocally a good thing; the up-front penny on income tax to pay for ... whatever seems to have slipped quietly away, and although I'm sure it was there, proportional representation wasn't an \"in your face\" subject of discussion.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have two areas of strong credibility. The first is the environment. Curbing car use is something which can no longer be put off and so, at first sight, punitive taxation on 4x4 vehicles seems sound. I am uneasy though about continuing to use taxation as a disincentive to undesirable behaviour. If it is essential to change the way we live, then to suggest that profligate use of resources is OK if you can afford it is wrong. It would be more honest to make Britain a place where only fuel efficient cars were allowed. </p> <p>More radical still, reduce road use by raising the age at which people can have a first licence to 21 and remove the licences of 70-year-olds while giving them free public transport. Ideas like these are the sort of suicidal vote losers the like of which we will never see again.</p> <p>More too could have been suggested to encourage the use of renewable energy sources by individual households. Relax planning laws to allow small roof mounted wind turbines perhaps, and interest free loans on the purchase of turbines and solar panels. Farmers could be given 100% grants to generate power for their own requirements.</p> <p>Then there's the war. No problem for Charles Kennedy taking the moral high ground here. Is it the vote winner he thinks it is? Well, since many more of us can remember being against the war from the outset than we actually were, we are all Lib Dems now it would seem. It's not that clearcut, however. No one believes that had the Conservatives been in power we would not have followed George Bush into Iraq, and Labour supporters think, rightly, that many more Labour MPs would have opposed the war were they in opposition at the time. </p> <p>So who owns this terrible mistake? Firstly, Tony Blair, secondly, we all do. More important still is the psychology of the situation; how we got here is history, but now we have an enemy we want to win, no matter that \"winning\" is a hazy concept in this case.</p> <p>Doubtless there are some angry Labour voters who could switch or abstain, but the most damaging aspect of the Iraq conflict is the apparent dishonesty of the prime minister. Both Liberals and Conservatives will realise, too late, that they should have blamed New Labour more and Tony Blair less. Tony Blair may yet be thrown to the wolves and then, with one bound, Labour would be free of its embarrassment. I wish.</p> <p>I think the vexed question of how to pay for the succulent goods on offer to the public in return for their votes should be ignored. The reason why we are misled by politicians over taxation is that if we are told the truth, that things cost money and tax payers provide it, we go and vote for someone else. The myth of our times, therefore, is that there are endless savings to be made by an astute government. There aren't. The most we can ask for from a political party is a rough indication of where their loyalties lie. Who are they going to smack and who are they going to stroke?</p> <p>The most worrying thing to come out of the Liberal Democrat conference was a comment from Mark Oaten that the press would not allow a sensible debate on the treatment of offenders. Presumably if he had announced that convicted joyriders would be dragged through the streets behind go-karts, the assembled press would have drifted away mumbling \"no story here lads\". He is quite right. Such is the dominance of the rightwing press in Britain today that balanced discussion of many major areas of policy has been swamped by the volume of sneering, distortion and deception which is put out on a daily basis.</p> <p>Most of us realise that the politics we are allowed to discuss is the politics of the right. Are we therefore a free and democratic nation? It is vital, before the NHS falls to privatisation, that there is proper regulation of the media.</p> <p>So, top of my wish list? No single proprietor to own more than one national daily newspaper. No media ownership by anyone other than a British national or company paying taxes in Britain.</p>",

  "<p>Tefl is undoubtedly an excellent way to find work abroad as an English speaking national, whether or not you have knowledge of the language in your destination country. This makes it an attractive option for anyone planning to switch their current situation for a new life overseas. </p> <p>It's relatively straightforward to get on to a quality Tefl course if you have the right qualifications, motivation and perspective, plus a moderate dose of linguistic awareness. </p> <p>Schools have to fulfil the requirements laid down by Cambridge and Trinity on accepting candidates, and they don't want to be faced with trainees who fail because they were insufficiently prepared or unsuited to the course of study. </p> <p>Beyond that, education providers want to fill their courses, and they will accept trainees on the course even if they have reservations as to whether that person will have the \"get up and go\" required to make a success of Tefl.</p> <p>However, before coughing up the \u00a3900 for a course, make sure that you're committed - that it's something that you really want to do and that you're not simply embarking on the educational equivalent of retail therapy. It will not be enough to guarantee a successful life transition, nor a job abroad, nor a fulfilling life as a teacher. </p> <p>If you consider the amount of time and energy people put into finding a new job within a sector, imagine just how much extra effort is required if you are to change not only your line of work, but also your whole social, cultural and linguistic environment. </p> <p>The decision to take a Tefl course is just one part of that process. Four weeks of intensive focus on teaching English will fire you with enthusiasm, but it's important to have the next steps thought out in advance, so that the momentum keeps you going throughout the critical period between the end of the course and starting that all-important first job. </p> <p>Finding a job is said to be easier than getting through the course, but it still requires persistence and energy. If you are interested in other people, have a \"go for it\" attitude and show you're keen to start teaching, that will shine through and potential employers will separate you from the crowd.</p>",
  "Gordon Brown today backed the extension of choice in the public sector when he told Labour conference that the \"personalisation\" of services will be stepped up in the party's third term. <p>In a 35-minute speech warmly received by Labour delegates in Brighton, the chancellor ruled out \"irresponsible pre-election promises\" and specifically rejected the renationalisation of the railways - likely to be voted for by delegates this afternoon - saying it would waste \u00a322bn.</p> <p>But he trumpeted high-quality affordable care for all as one of the priorities of a historic third Labour term, as well as a \"second chance\" in education for all adults by rolling out employer training pilots nationwide.</p> <p>In a typically passionate and evangelical speech, which received a three-minute standing ovation, the chancellor put the case for free state education and healthcare in Britain as an example to Africa and the developing world as much as a service in its own right.</p> <p>In a passage that will excite Westminster watchers of the Blair/Brown relationship, he reminded delegates that even the \"great 1945 Labour government was undermined by economic failure\" - a tacit reference to his own widely respected handling of the economy since 1997. His final, coded words were: \"We have much more to do.\"</p> <p>Indeed, Mr Brown was so bold as to reverse the traditional mantra of British politics, boasting to the hall: \"From being the party not trusted with the economy, this conference should be proud that Labour is today the only party trusted with the economy.\"</p> <p><b>Domestic agenda</b><br></p> <p>Although long sections of his speech dealt with global aid and the economic threat from China and India, Mr Brown began by addressing the public services agenda.</p> <p>He said: \"The public sector reform agenda - more flexibility, accountability and personalisation will not stall but be stepped up.</p> <p>\"We will go ahead with our civil service reforms; and if the government had \u00a322bn to spend it will not be for an expensive renationalisation. We will put investment in schools and hospitals first.\"</p> <p>Although there were no concrete new policy proposals in the speech, Mr Brown said he would use November's pre-budget report to set out plans for \"high-quality affordable childcare for all and nursery education more suited to parents' needs.\"</p> <p>He criticised the achievements of 50 years of the welfare state for still failing on equal pay, maternity rights, childcare and child poverty, saying these now formed the \"new frontier for social change\".</p> <p>He also reannounced a pledge, made by the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, for a third-term goal of 12 months' paid parental leave.</p> <p>And he called the \"next stage of public service reform\" having a children's centre of childcare, health and education at every school through longer opening hours. This he called the \"British progressive consensus\". </p> <p>Mr Brown ended his speech with poetry: \"It is the hands of others who bring us into the world and who lower us into the earth. It is by the strong helping the weak that we are all made stronger.\"</p> <p><b>International issues</b><br></p> <p>Earlier he warned of the trade threat from China and India, where workers can be paid as little as \u00a317 a week while their universities produce a combined total of four million graduates a year.</p> <p>But he insisted the response should be investing in \"real skills\" rather than a race to the bottom.</p> <p>On the global economy, he stressed that it was still \"uneven and fragile\", with oil prices rising and imbalances worsening.</p> <p>Mr Brown's greatest passion was reserved for the section dealing with Africa - Mr Blair's destination next month - where he bemoaned the current rate of progress as taking 150 years to ensure that infant deaths would be cut, or all children receive a primary education.</p> <p>However, he stressed that the poorest countries must \"draw up their anti-poverty programmes to open up trade and investment, and tackle corruption\" before Britain's long standing commitment of giving 0.7% of GDP will be met.</p> <p>Like most speakers at the conference, Mr Brown began by prefacing his speech with concern for the well-being of British hostage in Iraq Kenneth Bigley.</p> <p><b>'Building prosperity'</b><br></p> <p>Continuing the debate on \"Building Prosperity for All\" , the new work and pensions secretary, Alan Johnson, announced he would be creating a taskforce of trained union officials to advise workers on pensions.</p> <p>Although his speech contained no numbers on how much money the government could be putting into such a scheme, Mr Johnson - only promoted to the cabinet this month - told delegates: \"I want workers to get advice on pensions as they increasingly do on lifelong learning from a source they can trust - their trade union representative.\"</p> <p>Mr Johons - himself a former general secretary of the Communication Workers union - went on: \"That's why I can announce today the creation of a new challenge fund to generate more workplace advice by specially trained union representatives.\"</p> <p>But he warned that ending the \"head stuck in the sand culture\" was not something \"the government can do on its own\".</p> <p><b>Vision for business</b><br></p> <p>Ahead of the chancellor's speech, Ms Hewitt used her conference address to outline a vision for business under a New Labour third term, with the government \"making the case for trade and industry\" at home and abroad, she said.</p> <p>A total of 2.5 million new businesses would be supported to \"start up and grow\" over five years, to ensure job creation in the future</p> <p>In a clear nod of appeal to the business community, Ms Hewitt today sketched out new Labour's five-year plan for business growth ahead of the predicted general election next summer.</p> <p>The government would continue to boost business's place in the global economy by helping 20,000 more manufacturers through its Manufacturing Advisory Service, she said, \"because, conference, the world is changing almost faster than we can imagine\".</p> <p>Ms Hewitt also signalled the government's commitment to closing the gender pay gap, which still women earning 20% less than men, through the setting up of a new Commission on Women and Work, announced earlier this summer following the Warwick summit with trade unions.</p> <p>\"Women are rightly demanding a better deal at work,\" she told delegates. \"So Tony Blair and I have asked Margaret Prosser to chair a new commission on Women and Work, bringing together people and ideas to tackle scandal of unequal pay. And we will have their first ideas in time for the manifesto.\"</p> <p>Lauding New Labour's commitment to marry economic success with social justice, Ms Hewitt flagged up the government's commitment to eradicating poverty pay through the minimum wage, increased to \u00a34.85 this week.</p>",
  "<p>Let me say first of all, the thoughts of everyone at this conference are with Ken Bigley and all his brave family. And all of us here - and I believe everyone throughout the country - will give and must give in these difficult times Tony Blair our full support. </p> <p>Conference, I come here, after seven years as your Labour Chancellor, not just to tell you that we have done but to tell you how much more we have yet to do. </p> <p>And I come to this conference after seven years of this New Labour government more idealistic than ever, more determined and more certain than ever about what it is our duty to achieve for Britain. '</p> <p>No longer the most inflation prone economy, with New Labour, Britain today has the lowest inflation for thirty years. </p> <p>No longer the boom-bust economy, Britain has had the lowest interest rates for forty years. </p> <p>And no longer the stop-go economy, Britain is now enjoying the longest period of sustained economic growth for 200 years.</p> <p>And no longer the country of mass unemployment, Britain is now advancing further and faster towards full employment than at any time in our lives.</p> <p>And after decades of underinvestment, investment in schools is doubling, in policing doubling, in transport doubling, in housing doubling, and instead of \u00a340 billion spent on the NHS in 1997, by 2008 \u00a3110 billion for the NHS. </p> <p>From being the party not trusted with the economy, this conference should be proud that Labour is today the only party trusted with the economy. </p> <p>But for me, for us the Labour party, and for the country, this is not enough. </p> <p>We have created 1.8 million jobs. But for us, the Labour party, this is not enough.</p> <p>We have lifted one million children and more than one million pensioners out of poverty. But we must do more.</p> <p>We have introduced the minimum wage and raised it by 35 per cent to make work pay. But we will do more.</p> <p>We have created one million child care places. But we will go further. </p> <p>Economic stability and new incentives have helped create 300,000 new businesses. But that is not enough. </p> <p>We will not rest until millions denied opportunity can achieve their aspirations and until the three million children living in poverty are growing up in a Britain where child poverty has been eradicated for good.</p> <p>We will not rest until Britain's public services - starved for two decades, now being rebuilt - are reformed and renewed, an example to the world and the collective pride of our nation. </p> <p>We will not rest until enterprise is open to all, creating hundreds more businesses in every community, and where the millions of men and women - some lone parents, some on incapacity benefit - who want to work will have the right to work, in a Britain where there is full employment in every region and every nation of our country. </p> <p>In the last seven years we have started to win the argument, our party's argument, that you will never build a successful economy by writing off the talents of the unemployed.</p> <p>That you will never build stability through the stop go, quick fixes of the past but - as with reforming the Bank of England - only through planning for the long term. </p> <p>And we are winning the argument too that we must have low inflation to create growth, responsibilities in the new deal to create jobs, that more competition is essential to create prosperity and that private and public sectors must work together to create investment. </p> <p>And with sustained public support for our decision to raise national insurance to pay for our reforms in the NHS, we are winning the argument that the way to fund and provide health care is not private insurance which insures only some of the people some of the time but national insurance which is insuring all of the people all of the time. </p> <p>And we are showing - and we will honour, as Tony Blair has said, the agreement at Warwick - that by guaranteeing a minimum wage and proper rights at work that the modern route to prosperity is not exploitation in the workplace but fairness in the workplace.</p> <p>And we are showing that through tax credits now paid to 6 million hard working families we can make work pay and reduce family poverty. </p> <p>I believe that we have shown that when we make a compelling case and trust the progressive instincts of the British people we can build a shared sense of national purpose, we can build a progressive consensus that inspires the country, a consensus that prosperity and justice for all can advance together. </p> <p>I tell this conference, for me, for this party and for this country, our achievements of the last seven years, important as they are, are not enough.</p> <p>As British citizens, Labour party members, as parents we are called to ask: what kind of Britain would we be proud to hand on to our children and grandchildren.</p> <p>A great Britain of aspiration and ambition where there are no barriers to achievement, no ceilings on talent, no cap on success and where the common sense of the age is that not just a few but everyone has the chance to fulfil their dreams and potential: that opportunity in education, in business, in culture and in leisure is genuinely equal and open not just for those born into wealth and privilege but for all. </p> <p>A Great Britain where people say with pride, </p> <p>'This is our country, Great Britain; we built it generation to generation upon the foundation of liberty duty and fairness; </p> <p>'We are enriching it, extending new opportunities to all;</p> <p>'A Britain where - because we recognise our shared needs, mutual obligations and linked destinies - it is not every man for himself not them against us, but we the people working together for a better life future for all'. </p> <p>A patriotic vision </p> <p>learning from but different from America whom I admire for its enterprise but where - with 45 million without health insurance - great economic success is not matched by great social justice; </p> <p>learning from but different from the rest of Europe which has greater social cohesion but where, with 19 million out of work, that social cohesion is not matched by economic dynamism.</p> <p>Our mission for Britain is both prosperity and justice for all. </p> <p>And in our generation, I want us to build a shared national purpose, a British progressive consensus, much more than a set of individual policies announced by politicians but a set of beliefs that come to be shared by the British people - that Britain can lead by example as the first country of the global age where prosperity and justice advance together.</p> <p>Our task therefore is not to consolidate the politics we inherited but by our words and deeds to transform people's view of what in our country is possible.</p> <p>To seek to win not just votes but hearts and minds to a shared national purpose - far beyond the ranks of our party or any party.</p> <p>And today we have to realise this vision amidst a profound set of economic changes unparalleled in our economic history which we can only meet by a unity of purpose together.</p> <p>If only seven years ago there was no DVD, no digital TV, no broadband, a fraction of people with mobile phones or connected to the internet, then think of how in the next few years ever faster changes in digital technologies and genetics will touch upon every aspect of our lives and revolutionise our economy. </p> <p>And we face these dramatic changes when developing countries are now rising to become world manufacturing centres. competition fiercer than ever because India pays its workers just \u00a318 a week, China \u00a317, Philippines less than \u00a317; China now exporting more than France, Italy and Britain; China and India now producing 4 million graduates every year. </p> <p>But when people ask: whether in the face of this new global market in labour, capital, and goods we can still aspire to be the country which is not just for a few but for all of our children the greatest place to grow up in; whether we can still be a country where we can advance to full employment and where not just a few but all our young people can make the most of their talents; whether we can still hold fast to our vision of Britain, I say: in the face of these challenges, the future lies not in abandoning our vision of a Britain of opportunity for all - but making it come alive for our time. Ours is a vision that works for Britain not in spite of our Labour values, but as I said last year, because of our Labour values. </p> <p>For just as it will be the nations that fail to open up opportunity, get the best out of their people, fail to tap the potential of all their citizens that will rapidly fall behind, so it is also true that the countries that will succeed best in the global economy will be those that bring out the best talents of all no matter their birth, race, sex or background.</p> <p>And my message to the country is that Britain will succeed best by showing the ingenuity, talents, dynamism, creativity and inventiveness of all our people are second to none. </p> <p>But to those who say there should be no change without security, I tell you honestly: there can be no security without change.</p> <p>And it is because nations will rise and fall at speed because no nation can ever now take its future prosperity for granted, and the race will be won by the skilled, the flexible, the enterprising and the creative that in the budget and pre budget report we will tackle one by one barrier by barrier the economic obstacles that hold us as a country back.</p> <p>Our success depends first upon entrenching our hard won stability. </p> <p>Facing a global recovery that is uneven and still fragile, where oil prices have doubled and imbalances have worsened, I will tell the G7 and IMF when I travel to Washington later this week that we will take no risks with inflationary pay deals, and from this Chancellor and this party no short-termism, no easy options, no irresponsible pre election promises.</p> <p>We will never be complacent about stability. We must show at all times we have the discipline and strength to take the tough long term fiscal and monetary decisions for Britain. because, with the economy central to people's concerns at this next election as at every election, that is the way to entrench and retain the trust of the people on the economy and pay for the much needed reforms and investments in public services. </p> <p>And we must seize not squander the opportunities our stability now offers us. And in the pre budget report I will not disguise the scale of the long term scientific, technological, trade, environmental and social changes that every industrial economy now has to make.</p> <p>Expanding our ten year science plan, so that we can be proud that new British ideas and inventions are turned into new British products, new British exports, that in turn create new British manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>And expanding the R&amp;D tax credit, most of which will go to manufacturing investment allowances, most to manufacturing, regional venture capital funds, much to manufacturing, and implementing the new regional manufacturing strategies agreed at Warwick we will prove to the world that in the new global economy far from manufacturing being a relic of the industrial revolution we will build in British factories from aerospace to pharmaceuticals, from engineering to fashion, in hardware and in software, a Britain of modern manufacturing strength. </p> <p>Through stability and tax incentives and infrastructure, and by cutting red tape and planning delays, we want to see, in every community, enterprise flourish and John Prescott and I plan to do more to ensure that when local councils become ambassadors for new business creation and support schools and colleges promoting enterprise, councils get the benefit of new business not just in new jobs but the benefit of the n new business rates income that can pay for better local services. </p> <p>And because affordable housing is the key to personal prosperity for millions, John Prescott and I will implement the barker review with new plans to bring homes within the reach of first time buyers, including expanding affordable housing for key workers in our public services.</p> <p>China and India's wages are just five per cent of ours, but I say to you: we will not compete by lowering our wages or lowering standards but by raising our skills. and so we will, at the coming election, make a historic promise: by moving beyond the voluntarist system of training that has failed, by extending nationwide our employer training pilots, Charles Clarke and I will make a reality of a second chance in education for all, for the first time guaranteeing to every single member of the workforce and every unemployed man and women who is without basic skills, the resources and the learning facilities to acquire the skills they need, giving them the choices they need to make the most of their talents. </p> <p>And I want us to make a promise to all those over 16 in work or at school or colleges: for 16 and 17 year olds for the first time a New Labour guarantee of a minimum wage from the age of 16.</p> <p>And by extending our education maintenance allowances, ending the injustice of teenagers in our poorest communities forced by family circumstance to leave school early even when they wanted to stay on, ensuring whatever your means or family background you can now stay on and fulfil your potential.</p> <p>And when some claim it is wrong to set a target so that 50 per cent of our young people can enjoy higher education, telling us that more means worse, let us tell them what would be wrong is to put a cap on aspiration when today just 15 per cent of children from poorest families get to university - and when countries from America to Taiwan and Korea are moving towards 60 per cent and then 70 per cent, understanding aspiration is not a luxury it is an imperative.</p> <p>And if we are to meet the global economic challenge, skills must be matched by flexibility and there will be no room for the old British complacency, or the old battles between public and private sectors - which must work together. So I tell you honestly the public sector reform agenda - more flexibility, accountability and personalisation will not stall but be stepped up; we will go ahead with our civil service reforms; and if the government had \u00a322 billion to spend it will not be for an expensive re-nationalisation. We will put investment in schools and hospitals first.</p> <p>It is simply wrong that people who lose their jobs can lose their pensions too, so in partnership with the trade unions we have set up the new pension protection fund, and for pension funds that have previously gone bust we have already put aside \u00a3400 million. I tell you we will work with the unions to do what it takes to tackle the gross injustice of workers who through no fault of their own find their pensions have been destroyed. </p> <p>I say to this conference: having adopted the New Labour policies - minimum income guarantee, the pension credit, the winter fuel payment, the state second pension - and cleared up the scandal of Tory pension mis-selling, and as Alan Johnson will say later in this debate, we will also respond to the new pension commission by doing what it takes to make sure that all workers can have security and dignity in retirement. </p> <p>A Britain of prosperity and justice will continue to promote competition, liberalisation and reform to strengthen not just the economy of Britain but of Europe, because as pro-Europeans committed to the progress of the European Union we know that in the years to come the test that the British people will apply to Europe is that it embraces reform, resists federal fiscal policies, rejects tax harmonisation, and tackles, root and branch, the waste and excesses of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>Here in Britain we seek to build a new progressive consensus not only in a new world of economic change but also of social change and new aspirations. </p> <p>I'll tell you where now and in the next Parliament we can be pioneers for justice. I'll tell you where the front line is in the battle against unfairness. I'll tell you the new frontier for social change in our country. </p> <p>When I look at over fifty years of the welfare state - and see:</p> <p>How little we in Britain have advanced towards equal pay;</p> <p>What little we have done for maternity rights;</p> <p>What little for child care;</p> <p>How much we still have to do to end centuries of discrimination against women in work and at home; </p> <p>How far we still have to go to eradicate child and family poverty;</p> <p>I know that it was a scandal that before 1997 it was our country - Britain - that did least in Europe and as a result wasted the potential and talents of millions. </p> <p>And in the year 2004 we still cannot be satisfied as long a poor child is still three times more likely to die before the age of one than someone born to privilege. We cannot relax when we know that the time from the cradle to the nursery school - the time that does most to determine life chances - is also the time when we offer mothers and fathers the least.</p> <p>So as Patricia Hewitt has said we will now set as a goal for the next term, a total of twelve months paid parental leave giving parents more choice to stay at home for the first year of their child's life.</p> <p>We will set up a commission on the gender pay gap and review the right for parents to request flexible working, because we have not yet done enough and we must do more.</p> <p>And - in children's services - embracing diversity of provision, extending the range of effective choice, and working with charity, voluntary and private providers, the Pre Budget Report will, with Charles Clarke, set out a plan for high quality affordable child care for all and nursery education more suited to parents needs.</p> <p>And with every school offering extended opening, and at the heart of every community a Children's Centre, a centre for childcare, health and education, this is the next stage of public serviced reform, the next stage of extending opportunity in our universal welfare state. </p> <p>And because we want high quality childcare and children's services that in every area - as Sure Start has shown - listen to and meet the needs of children and parents, in the Pre Budget Report we are going to encourage and sponsor local forums up and down the country to listen to parents so that their voices are heard and their needs come first. </p> <p>It is through extending tax credits - as the Burns family said this morning - that we will we meet our 2004 target to reduce child poverty by one quarter, and we must now advance to our next goal which is even more ambitious: to halve child poverty by 2010. </p> <p>In this party we believe one child in poverty impoverishes us all. But let us face the fact that we need to win more people to this cause. </p> <p>So in every constituency we, the Labour party, must reach out beyond the Labour party, and reach out to voluntary charitable and community groups, reach out to every neighbourhood and build a progressive consensus that every child having the best start in life is the obligation this generation owes and will discharge to the next. </p> <p>So our task is nothing less than building and sustaining a shared national purpose, the British progressive consensus, that no child in Britain is left behind and that our future lies not in two nations ever more divided by inequality but in one nation united in prosperity for all. </p> <p>And how do we build and sustain this shared national purpose?</p> <p>Look back on previous governments - </p> <p>Great achievements, landmark reforms</p> <p>Many that stood the test not just of one parliament but the test of generations. </p> <p>And in their time they sought to build a progressive consensus - the shared national unity of purpose essential for their ideas to endure so that no future government, no matter how different, was able to undo their reforms. </p> <p>But we must ask ourselves why even for the historic 1906 and 1945 governments that after a few years the momentum that sustained them forward stalled, and that while the initiatives continued the impulse that supported change dimmed. </p> <p>And there are two lessons we must learn.</p> <p>First, even that great 1945 Labour government was undermined by economic failure. So let me say honestly to the party and the country that in meeting the long term challenges ahead we must and will take no risks with the long term policies for stability and prudence I have and I will set out. </p> <p>And the second lesson is that they failed to go out and deepen popular support for the next stage of their advance. </p> <p>And instead of sustaining a progressive consensus in the country they failed even to sustain a consensus among themselves.</p> <p>And so all of us must do whatever we can to ensure that we build the unity of purpose that this country needs by ensuring the strength of our unity of purpose in this party.</p> <p>So I tell you that as a Party we must do more to learn the lessons of the past. </p> <p>We must show we are rooted in our communities not remote from them.</p> <p>Instead of retreating to being administrators for our policies we must also become evangelists for them.</p> <p>And I know that I and all of us must do more if the Labour party's aspirations for Britain are to continue to be the British peoples aspirations for Britain and if we are to build and sustain that progressive consensus,</p> <p>We must reach out to people in new ways within and beyond the Labour party;</p> <p>Reinvigorate elected local government;</p> <p>Be open and transparent by reforming undemocratic institutions;</p> <p>And - united as a party around our long term vision - unite the country around our vision showing by what we do every day that the true purpose of politics is to serve your country. </p> <p>And the big idea is that we will build and sustain a progressive consensus in our country for a Britain of prosperity and justice for all, a progressive consensus that the British people want to prevent any future government from undoing. </p> <p>And so, I want everyone in this party to share in this ambition: for the first time in our party's history, a third term Labour government, creating that progressive consensus.</p> <p>And this matters not just to us here in the Labour party or in Britain but far wider than that - to all countries especially developing countries seeking also to build economic prosperity and social justice for their people.</p> <p>In 2000 the whole world came together to make a solemn promise for 2015, the millennium development goals:</p> <p>the promise of primary education for every child;</p> <p>the promise of an end to avoidable infant and maternal deaths;</p> <p>the promise of a halving of poverty.</p> <p>But on current rates of progress, in Sub-Saharan Africa:</p> <p>The promise of primary education for all will be delivered not in 2015, but 2130, 115 years too late;</p> <p>The promise for the halving of poverty not by 2015, but 2150, 135 years too late; </p> <p>And the promise of cutting infant deaths not by 2015 but by 2165, 150 years too late. </p> <p>And I say:</p> <p>150 years is too long for a people to wait for justice;</p> <p>150 years is too long to wait when infants are dying in Africa when there are medicines in the rest of the world to heal them; </p> <p>150 years is too long to wait for promises to be redeemed and a bond of trust to be honoured; </p> <p>150 years is too long to wait when all the world lacks is the will to act.</p> <p>So I am proud that it is because of the work of Labour party members and the votes of Labour supporters that will allow me and Hilary Benn to travel as a Labour Chancellor, your representative, to go this week to Washington, and at the annual IMF, G7 and World Bank meetings and, with Jack Straw, make the case for our unique Labour proposals, as we work together to make poverty history. </p> <p>That if the poorest countries draw up their anti-poverty programmes to open up trade and investment, and tackle corruption, we the richest countries will through an international finance facility ensure we honour the timetable to reach 0.7 per cent of GDP and for the first time plan \u00a350 billion more - to act against debt, disease, illiteracy, Aids and poverty. </p> <p>But the contribution we can make is more than money.</p> <p>It is the inspiration that comes from Britain leading by example by combining prosperity with justice. </p> <p>If, as I said to you last year, we from here in Britain cannot win the battle for an NHS free at the point of need funded from taxation not charges then what hope is there for Africa - where the poor cannot afford to pay for even the most basic health care and where the only hope of tackling disease, illness and Aids is a health service free to all based on need not ability to pay.</p> <p>But it is more than that: if we cannot show in Britain that state schooling free of charge is the best way forward for children then what hope is there for Africa or for the developing world - where the only hope for the 120 million children denied schooling is not paying for education but free education.</p> <p>But if we can show a publicly funded health service free at the point of need delivers to all the people,</p> <p>If we can show modern state schooling free of charge is the best hope for all children,</p> <p>If we can show the ethic of public service is so strong that public services can provide efficiently for all people without having to privatise or charge,</p> <p>if we can show that here in Britain we can create not just a programme for prosperity and justice but a popular movement that says in clear unequivocal terms that it is prosperity and justice by which the British people want to be defined to the world,</p> <p>If we can show that when politics succeeds jobs are created, health improves, opportunity blossoms, and people flourish, </p> <p>Then what a difference our country can make to our world.</p> <p>I have seen this ethic of public service at work;</p> <p>I have seen doctors and nurses who show not only exceptional skill and professionalism but extraordinary care and friendship; </p> <p>carers whose unbelievable compassion and support can transform despair into hope;</p> <p>home helps and support staff whose dedication, commitment and humanity show that there are values far beyond those of contracts, markets and exchange and that public service can be a calling and not just a career.</p> <p>The ethic of public service summed up best in poetry: </p> <p>\"It is the hands of others who grow the food we eat, who sew the clothes we wear, who build the houses we inhabit; </p> <p>\"It is the hands of others who tend us when we're sick and lift us up when we fall;</p> <p>\"It is the hands of others who bring us into the world and who lower us into the earth.\"</p> <p>So we are not isolated individuals but we depend on each other.</p> <p>It is by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we achieve alone.</p> <p>It is by the strong helping the weak that we are all made stronger.</p> <p>And in those famous words, while the arc of the moral universe is long, it bends towards justice.</p> <p>So have confidence in our values.</p> <p>Have confidence united in our values we will build the progressive consensus of prosperity and justice for all. </p> <p>Have confidence our achievements are just a beginning: we have much more to do.</p>",
  "<p>A BBC plan to make Panorama more \"touchy-feely\" has provoked outrage among senior current affairs staff at the corporation, with one calling the idea \"ridiculous\".</p> <p>Several senior BBC figures have privately expressed their fury at the proposal, contained in a briefing document leaked to the Guardian, that Panorama should recruit presenters with \"warmer\" faces such as Fiona Bruce and use storylines from EastEnders to make it more accessible.</p> <p>\"The idea of a touchy-feely programme that doesn't dilute the authority of Panorama is for the birds. It's a ridiculous idea,\" said one prominent journalist.</p> <p>\"You can't 'feel' Maastricht or Bosnia and you cannot have a lighter touch with no diminution of authority. This is groundhog day, it's boring. We've been here before.</p> <p>\"I don't want to hear Fiona Bruce on Maastricht, I want to hear Peter Jay on Maastricht. Does a midweek slot mean a change in the requirements for the programme? I don't think it does. Of course you do it better and you make it sharper, you always strive for that and you can always improve programmes. But there is no magic formula.\"</p> <p>The publication of the report, which said Panorama needed an overhaul because it had become \"too distant, demanding, difficult and didactic\", has provoked a wave of reaction at the BBC, with some agreeing the programme needs to be warmer while others warned that the corporation throws out \"giants of journalism\" such as John Ware at its peril.</p> <p>The eight-page document was drawn up for the BBC executive in charge of the programme, Peter Horrocks, in response to a demand from new chairman Michael Grade that BBC executives rethink the prominence of current affairs.</p> <p>The Panorama editor, Mike Robinson, is said to have been so angry that he confronted Mr Horrocks and demanded it be withdrawn. It is believed the producer called an emergency meeting of staff at lunchtime to address their concerns.</p> <p>Former Panorama editor Steve Hewlett, who landed the scoop and ratings of the decade when he and Martin Bashir got the Princess Diana interview, warned that a \"touchy-feely\" makeover might hamstring the programme when it tried to tackle more serious topics.</p> <p>\"I fail to see how you could 'live and experience the truth' of the Maastricht Treaty,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It's illusory to think you could deal with every story in that way. You could speculate what life would be like under various different scenarios, but I personally think that would be less informative and interesting than listening to Peter Jay discuss something he really knows about.</p> <p>\"Audiences to these programmes tend to be dictated by choice of subject, rather than its treatment. There are always issues about the way stories are told, but I am not aware that Panorama is known for its overly didactic, hectoring style. </p> <p>\"Before you set about redesigning it you have to think how it is going to deal with issues like Bosnia or Northern Ireland. It isn't Real Story [the BBC1 current affairs strand fronted by Fiona Bruce]. It has to focus on things which are of direct interest to the viewer, from house prices and the health service to slightly more high minded issues to international events and global terrorism.\"</p> <p>Bruce has been mentioned as one of the stars who should be parachuted in for \"human interest\" specials alongside Jeremy Paxman, who would be used for more serious issues, a suggestion that may not have gone down well with the Ten O'Clock News presenter.</p> <p><strong>No other broadcaster has a John Ware</strong><br></p> <p>Former BBC current affairs chief Samir Shah said the key was for Panorama to continue doing flagship investigation shows along the lines of BBC1's The Secret Policeman, which exposed racism in the British National party.</p> <p>\"For me the main point is can Panorama continue to do those major pieces of revelatory investigative journalism by people like John Ware,\" he said. </p> <p>\"No other organisation in broadcasting has the time, resources or ability to nurture a figure like John Ware. Does the new Panorama allow that still to flourish? That is what makes Panorama distinct.\"</p> <p>Mr Shah, who was head of current affairs at the BBC between 1987 and 1994 and now heads up independent production company Juniper, said Panorama had always been under pressure to extend its appeal.</p> <p>\"My second reaction is plus ca change. We always used to worry about reaching audiences and whether the programme was warm or popular enough. </p> <p>\"I can't disagree with the idea that it should be warmer or reach more people. Panorama is one of the few areas where proper current affairs can be done, and we should always be trying to reach audiences and tell stories well. Panorama must examine and test and call the government to account, as well as every now and again firing off an Exocet missile in the form of John Ware.\"</p> <p><strong>Yes, Paxman does need a BBC1 presence</strong> </p> <p>Mr Shah welcomed the proposal to use Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman to anchor the show. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure I would describe him as warm or touchy-feely but Jeremy Paxman has star quality and he needs a BBC1 presence. He has been terrific on Newsnight and if that is a way of getting him a presence on BBC1 then that's good.\"</p> <p>One well-known senior BBC reporter at the BBC said he felt it was a good idea to give Paxman his own \"authored\" documentary slot if he wanted but said there was a danger that the proposed changes in the document would give the BBC a different type of programme to Panorama.</p> <p>\"Paxman and Dimbleby and Humphrys are the three best-known interviewers in journalism. It would be a different kind of programme to use them, but a presenter-led programme would not be out of the question, it would be going back to the presenter-led era when David Dimbleby and Richard Dimbleby fronted films.\"</p> <p>There was also concern about any notion that the likes of Ware, Vivian White or Jane Corbin would be dispensed with.</p> <p>One journalist said: \"These guys are giants of current affairs journalism. John Ware was, for instance, involved in the recent unmasking of the loyalist killer [Ken Barrett]. I would be surprised if they threw these guys out. Peter Horrocks is a very serious guy and I imagine that [BBC director general] Mark Thompson would be very protective of the Panorama brand and wouldn't want to go down the Tonight with Trevor McDonald route.\"</p> <p>The BBC deputy director general, Mark Byford, issued a statement today confirming the existence of the report but defending the BBC's review of the programme.</p> <p> \"We have said unequivocally in Building Public Value that we intend to restore the prominence and appeal of serious current affairs on BBC television including on BBC1. Over the autumn, we are examining the best way to achieve this. </p> <p>\"Any discussions around the scheduling of Panorama are set firmly within a context of it remaining the flagship of serious, rigorous, trustworthy journalism and analysis. </p> <p>\"Panorama will focus on the stories that matter and courageous, investigative journalism from reporters of real calibre will remain a vital part of the programme.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Concern about the risks of pumping raw sewage into the Thames increased yesterday, as tests showed that even modest discharges raise the amount of bacteria in the water to potentially dangerous levels. </p> <p>The Guardian commissioned scientific analysis of water from two stretches of the river in west London, following moderate rainfall and a subsequent but unexceptional release of untreated sewage. It showed the level of harmful bacteria leapt way beyond levels considered safe under European regulations. </p> <p>The finding intensified calls for the government to sanction a \u00a31.5bn, 22-mile interceptor tunnel, to comprehensively update London's sewers and stop the regular outflow of untreated waste into the Thames. Ministers have yet to make a decision, but there is concern they may delay the project on the grounds of cost. </p> <p>Ken Livingstone, London's mayor, said: \"London cannot continue to put up with untreated sewage overflowing into the Thames 50 or 60 times each year. </p> <p>\"The Thames has an important role in providing recreational and leisure facilities, yet with each overflow, pathogens enter the river. This is just not acceptable in a leading world city.\" </p> <p>He said officials from his office, the Environment Agency, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Thames Water had been considering the problem for three years. \"The conclusion was that a sewer tunnel scheme is the most effective long-term solution. This is not an easy decision to make, but it is one that cannot be put off any longer.\" </p> <p>Jon Goddard, the technical director of the Environment Agency, said: \"The tests seem to show that even with a minor spill, there are health risks. When there is a big discharge, most people will know because there will have been heavy rain, but it is very difficult to have a warning system for minor discharges. The elimination of the discharges is the only solution.\" </p> <p>He said the findings had direct ramifications for those who use the river. \"Anyone practising a sport where they may ingest or come into contact with bacteria through wounds is at risk. You can't stop sports like rowing, but the risks are there and you must make a choice.\" </p> <p>At certain high-risk times, he said, rowers and canoeists might need to limit their exposure to the water. </p> <p><strong>Untreated</strong><br> </p> <p>The tests, conducted by Oakland Calvert Consultants, a south London-based laboratory with official accreditation, focused on samples taken from Hammersmith and Putney on September 13. The samples were collected in wet weather, just 12 hours after 48,000 cubic metres of untreated sewage and storm water was released from the western pumping station by Chelsea bridge. </p> <p>A further 12,000 tonnes was discharged from the Hammersmith pumping station and 9,000 tonnes from the Lots Road pumping station, near Battersea bridge. </p> <p>Samples were taken from the top foot of water in the middle of the river. </p> <p>The sample from Putney, close to the starting point for the annual Oxford v Cambridge Boat Race, was the most alarming. No bacterial standards are set for river water, but EU bathing water regulations are often applied in recreational waters. These set down a mandatory limit for the Escherichia coli bacteria of 2,000 units for every 100 millilitres. For the bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, the guideline is 100 units for every 100ml. </p> <p>Analysis of the water drawn from the river at Putney found 25,000 units for every 100ml of the E coli bacteria - more than 12 times the EU bathing water limit. The sample yielded more than 2,000 units of E faecalis. </p> <p>The reading was high because testers encountered a \"plug\" of sewage which had not yet dispersed. Drifting on the surface were condoms and sanitary towels. </p> <p>At Hammersmith bridge, the reading was lower but still cause for serious concern. There were 5,200 units of E coli per 100 millilitres, more than two and a half times the bathing water limit set down by the EU. The reading for E faecalis was 1,500 - 15 times the EU guideline. </p> <p>Mary Taylor, a biochemist and campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: \"The storm overflow system needs overhauling. We should have a high standard of water flowing through our capital city.\" </p> <p>The Corporation of London acts as the capital's port health authority. Roger Watson, its head of environmental services, said river users had to always take precautions. \"We are concerned that water used for leisure and commercial activities is as safe as it could be. Currently, it is not.\" </p> <p>On August 3 freak storms led to more than a million tonnes of raw sewage being discharged into the river. Oxygen levels were reduced to virtually nil from Kew, Brentford and Isleworth, and more than 10,000 fish died. During August, more than 5m tonnes of sewage was discharged in the river's upper reaches. </p> <p>Best estimates suggest the risk of catch ing an infection are elevated for about 48 hours after a significant discharge. With 50 to 60 such events a year, that means there are almost 120 high-risk days. Up to 5,000 people a week use the river for recreational sports. </p> <p>Regular users are already taking steps to protect themselves. Gemma Lloyd, a community sports coach at Putney and Twickenham rowing clubs, said members took no chances. \"After the big storm last month, the rowing authorities and Thames Water told us not to go out for four days. Rowers are told to cover up all cuts and grazes, and we are particularly careful about ensuring water bottles are not splashed by water from the river. As soon as we come off the water, we make sure juniors wash their hands and tell their parents to give them a good shower.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was deliberating. \"There are a lot of issues: planning and construction; the question of whether there are smaller scale measures that may alleviate problems in the interim, and whether, in fact, a tunnel really is the best way forward.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair last night lost the first round of his battle to refocus Labour's energies on a vote-winning domestic agenda when the party conference in Brighton backed calls for an emergency debate on Iraq, the most divisive controversy of his premiership. <p>Unless party managers can broker a compromise resolution it could result in an embarrassing defeat when delegates vote on Thursday - the day of the important Hartlepool byelection - and some urge the early recall of British troops. </p> <p>Labour's 2004 conference, overshadowed by the uncertainty about the fate of the British hostage Kenneth Bigley and heavily protected against assorted protests, began in a sombre mood - and stayed so. </p> <p>As partisans on both sides of the Blair-Brown divide over policy and leadership initially demonstrated public restraint in their comments, the chan cellor and his allies were last night signalling renewed impatience with the current thrust of election planning. </p> <p>In an article in today's Guardian, Ed Balls, the chancellor's righthand man, attacks demands for \"a more radical third term\" - shorthand for Alan Milburn, Mr Blair's new campaign strategist - as proof of debilitating pessimism. </p> <p>\"Don't get me wrong - we do need to debate radical policies for our manifesto. But the idea that the only way to have radical policies for the third term is by renouncing much of the last seven years is not an opportunity for our party but a serious mistake,\" writes Mr Balls, now Labour candidate for Normanton. </p> <p>Mr Blair was busy meeting delegates, determined to reinforce his position, and buttressed by cabinet allies who believe he remains Labour's crucial asset. </p> <p>Last night he risked a live, televised Q&amp;A session with activists. Rejecting claims that he considered quitting this spring, he earlier declared: \"I'm not the wobbling sort.\" His heir apparent, Gordon Brown, looks set to give the conference a coded version of the Balls message when he makes his speech on the economy in Brighton today and stresses the centrality of his own record in office to Labour's re-election hopes. </p> <p>In extracts from today's speech, released last night, the chancellor says that \"Labour is today the only party trusted with the economy\" and promises not to let inflationary pay deals, short-termism or \"irresponsible pre-election promises\" undermine that trust. </p> <p>Mr Blair, Mr Milburn and other senior colleagues were making similar pledges on the Sussex shore yesterday and praising Mr Brown's achievements - \"lowest interest rates for 30 years, the lowest inflation for 40 years, the longest period of sustained economic growth for 200 years\" as the chancellor himself put it. </p> <p>But they want Labour's third term manifesto to look forward, stressing wider con sumer choice in public services such as schools and hospitals - for too long the prerogative of the rich, Mr Milburn said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Brown is suspicious of both the goal and some of No 10's chosen policies to implement choice. </p> <p>Though aides stressed that his will be \"a unifying message\" - unlike last year's pointedly \"Real Labour\" conference speech - some MPs and observers saw provocation in one prominent passage. </p> <p>\"Our objective is prosperity and justice for all. In our generation I want us to build a shared national purpose for Britain, a progressive consensus. </p> <p>\"Much more than a set of individual policies announced by politicians, a set of beliefs that can be shared by the British people, that Britain can lead by example as the first country in a global age where prosperity and justice advance together.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair made his ritual pre-conference appearance on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost where he acknowledged mistakes over Iraq, but refused to apologise for removing Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>He tried to emphasise an upbeat domestic agenda, and all the plans he still nurses. </p> <p>With three mixed polls published yesterday - one in the News of the World putting the Tories ahead by 32% to 29% for the Lib Dems and Labour on 28% - it was a struggle. </p> <p>The Observer's Mori poll put Labour second on 32%, one percentage point behind the Tories, with the Lib Dems on 25%. Another poll reported Mr Blair to be as \"out of touch\" (63%) and \"inflexible\" (57%) as Margaret Thatcher before her fall. </p> <p>In addition to the vote by constituency activists to make Iraq one of the week's five \"contemporary\" - or emergency - motions, to be debated and voted on on Thurs day after a text has been agreed, delegates voted to defy the platform on council house sales. If accepted into the manifesto it would allow councils to retain control of housing stock and borrow to repair it, rather than be routinely encouraged to transfer homes to arms-length bodies. </p> <p>Today the unions look set to flex their muscles by insisting on a pledge to renationalise Network Rail and, eventually, the train operating companies too. Ministers will resist that. </p> <p>Mr Blair told David Frost he will highlight issues such as asylum, drugs, crime and reform of the education system. \"I'm restless to do more and to do better. I think we have done a good job for the country ... but there's more to do.\" </p> <p>But, in a forlorn attempt to stop what he called the endless media \"soap opera\" about the leadership, he said: \"You don't do deals about this job.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair also refused to confirm he will back Mr Brown, saying he had done so before. </p>",
  "<p>What are the chances of Richard Branson creating a financially viable space tourism business?</p> <p>Not great, according to Andrew Nahum, the senior curator of aeronautics at the Science Museum. I spoke to him after Sir Richard dropped a heavy hint about his plans during an interview in June (for a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/globalflyer/story/0,14532,1289039,00.html \">feature</a> on his latest record-breaking attempt, <a href=\"http://www.virginatlanticglobalflyer.com/\">Globalflyer</a>).</p> <p>As quoted in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1235925,00.html\">story</a> I subsequently wrote, Nahum said: </p> <blockquote> <p>You have got to put it in proportion - what you are doing is something more ambitious than Concorde. Even that was too expensive and never made a buck.</p> </blockquote> <p>Branson, though, does have a gutsy approach to seemingly impossible challenges - remember, he did want to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,982837,00.html\">buy Concorde</a>. </p> <p>It's unlikely that the entrepreneur will be accompanied by anyone other than other entrepreneurs for his inaugural flight. </p> <p>The price tag is a bit steep at the moment: each spacecraft will carry five passengers for \u00a3115,000 each. The idea is to eventually get the price down to around $10,000 - a sum that's less than the amounts already being shelled out by those wealthy enough to go on \"extreme\" holidays - <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,925457,00.html\">climbing Everest</a>, for instance. Whether that's cheap enough to turn space tourism into nothing more unusual than hopping on a short haul flight remains to be seen.</p> <p>Virgin Trains passengers on the West Coast Main Line may wonder why Branson can't pour his energies into improving his transport services on earth first: here's how he answered such criticism during a Guardian Unlimited <a href=\"http://talk.guardian.co.uk/WebX?128@@.77474101\">online chat</a> in August:</p> <blockquote> <p>We've spent 5 years and some billions of pounds working on sorting out the westcoast mainline. This September we will have replaced all the old delapidated British Rail stock with high speed Pendolino trains and the new timetable will cut an hour off the Manchester route and 30 mins off the Birmingham - London route. We will have trains every 15 minutes or so rather than every half an hour. The track work is catching up and I'm confident that 12 months from now with the combination of the new trains and track we'll have one of the best services in Europe on the Westcoast mainline. Virgin is a global brand and espires to be the most respected brand in the world and as such will continue to sponsor projects like the Global Flyer to keep us ahead of our rival companies.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you want to know more about how Branson's space tourism plans could work, our news graphics maestro, Paddy Allen, has created a great <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/flash/0,5860,1243994,00.html\">interactive guide</a> to SpaceShipOne.</p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday September 28 2004</b> <br> In an extract below, we report that in the run-up to the 1997 election, Sir David English was the editor of the Daily Mail. That is incorrect. Paul Dacre succeeded Sir David as editor in 1992. A spokesman for the Mail says Mr Dacre was accorded complete editorial autonomy by the then chairman - an independence that Sir David, by then editor-in-chief, also accepted.      By 1997 Tony Blair had achieved an extraordinary turnaround in making his party acceptable to the Australian media mogul, Rupert Murdoch. In stark contrast to the denigration of Neil Kinnock in 1992, New Labour's wooing of Murdoch paid handsome dividends with a ringing pre-election endorsement from the Sun. But Blair had an even greater public-relations prize in mind: he was desperate to secure the support of the Daily Mail - the essential organ of middle England. <p>Fortuitously, before the election, Blair's desire dovetailed neatly with the wishes of Sir David English, then editor of the Daily Mail. English was desperate for a peerage. John Major would have dearly loved to oblige - but every time English's name got near the top of the list, the Mail erupted into a frenzy over Major's stance in dealing with his Eurosceptic rebels. So it was out of the question. </p> <p>In the run-up to the 1997 election, though, there was an alternative prime minister in the wings. It was therefore no surprise that a series of discreet lunches took place in the Blairs' Islington home between the Associated Newspapers group's proprietor, the elderly Lord Rothermere, David English and the Blairs. </p> <p>Blair was anxious to win the Mail's support for New Labour; English, in turn, was keen to please. English even took advice from Lord Wakeham - a former Tory cabinet minister as well as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission - on what would be the best way to woo Blair. In the end, both sides got a result. </p> <p>Rothermere and English decided that the London Evening Standard would back Blair but the Mail would stay with the Tories. The decision was helpful - some of the biggest swings to Labour in 1997 took place in London, costing Tory stars like Michael Portillo their seats. English was ultimately awarded a life peerage but died from a stroke four days before it was due to be announced. </p> <p>In a statement on June 10 1998, Blair said: \"I counted David English as a friend. He was a truly outstanding journalist.\" Blair's spokesman said Buckingham Palace had given its permission for No 10 to announce that English was to be made a life peer ahead of the public announcement of the birthday honours on Saturday. </p> <p>In government, Blair initially maintained his cordial relationship with Associated. But Cherie, who has never been a fan of the Daily Mail, could not acquiesce. </p> <p>On January 24 1999 the Mail on Sunday published a contentious article headlined: \"Parents' Fury over Blairs in School Place Row.\" The story reported complaints from local parents that the Blairs had received preferential treatment in getting their daughter, Kathryn, into the Sacred Heart high school in Hammersmith - a well-regarded Catholic state school. A complaint was filed to the PCC in both the Blairs' names. </p> <p>The Mail on Sunday offered to publish a correction to avoid a PCC judgment against it. But it became clear in negotiations between Guy Black, director of the PCC, and Alastair Campbell that Downing Street was not interested in a mere correction. It dawned on Black, who became increasingly frustrated at the failure to reach a deal, that it was Cherie who was driving the issue. \"It looked to me that Alastair himself was having difficulty handling Cherie,\" Black told us. \"He made it very clear to me that he must have a win against Associated Newspapers.\" </p> <p>Cherie won the case and the Mail on Sunday was duly castigated. Much more than her husband, Cherie has what Lord Wakeham describes as \"a commendable mother's instinct to protect her children\" from media exposure. </p> <p>Relations with Associated were never as warm after the death of David English. Compared with his predecessor, the present editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, tends to appear chilly and aloof. When he, the new Viscount Rothermere, and their respective spouses, went to dinner with the Blairs at Downing Street in autumn 2000, it did not seem likely to be a particularly warm encounter. </p> <p>So it came as a pleasant surprise when Cherie produced the Blairs' new baby, Leo, for everyone to admire. But then the domestic informality went a little too far for the guardians of middle England. Cherie undid her blouse and began breast-feeding Leo. Dacre and Viscount Rothermere took Cherie's action to be a deliberate act of political hostility - whose meaning was to show the \"forces of conservatism\" that liberal values now held sway. The Mail's owners and executives left in a state of shock. </p> <p>In March 2003, Guy Black was summoned to Downing Street. Black remembers arriving at the door and being asked to go up to the prime minister's private flat. He had to clamber over lots of toys on the floor - Cherie's friend Carole Caplin was playing with Leo. Also in the room were Blair and Cherie and Fiona Millar. </p> <p>\"Cherie looked like a volcano that was about to erupt,\" he recalls. The prime minister began the conversation. He said he wanted the advice and help of the PCC on a very difficult situation: he wished for his children to be completely removed from the media spotlight. \"I would like to have a similar agreement which has been reached between the press and the royal family over the coverage of William and Harry,\" he told Black. By this he meant a special press ban covering the prime minister's family. In effect, he was asking for his family to be treated like royalty. </p> <p>\"I am afraid we cannot do this, prime minister,\" Black replied. \"Your children are not going to be public figures in their own right. William and Harry are heirs to the throne. We are certainly willing to take up any complaint about the breach of their privacy - but we cannot give an undertaking to do that.\" </p> <p>Blair frowned. Cherie looked furious. The prime minister was interrupted by a telephone call from the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. As he left, Cherie exploded: \"I must complain to you about the Daily Mail - it is a disgraceful paper,\" she raged. \"They have just suggested that I bought a cheap bottle of wine for Tony's birthday. This is a complete lie - it was a very expensive bottle. What are you going to do about it?\" </p> <p>\"Well, again, if you have a complaint you should take it up with the editor of the paper,\" replied Black evenly, \"and if you are still unhappy, you can take it up with us.\" Since then, Cherie has inundated the Daily Mail's lawyers with complaints about coverage of herself and her husband. </p> <p>Despite Black's refusal to be browbeaten on that occasion, the PCC has intervened this year on the Blairs' behalf to keep a private family problem out of the newspapers. But the Blairs had another strategy: in an unprecedented agreement between a serving politician and a global media organisation, News International proprietor Rupert Murdoch has imposed a worldwide ban on his newspapers reporting the matter. </p> <p>Two of Murdoch's foreign titles planned to run detailed articles on the Blairs' family troubles. The Australian pulled its story after News Corporation's executive chairman, Les Hinton, made a call to the deputy editor telling him the tale was off limits. The New York Daily Post withdrew its piece after similar pressure was brought to bear. The deal is thought to have been brokered by Alastair Campbell, who, though no longer Blair's press spokesman, is believed to be Blair's ambassador to Murdoch.</p> <p><b>The big chill: No 10's manoeuvres to block labour laws</b></p> <p>When Labour came into office in 1997, the European commission was trying to introduce a directive on information and consultation, designed to stop employees hearing on the television (or, in some notorious cases, by text message) that their factory had been shut and they were out of a job. </p> <p>The directive would require employers to inform and consult trade union representatives when closures were contemplated. </p> <p>Soon after Blair became prime minister, the ETUC, the European Trades Union Congress which represents European trade unions in Brussels, was startled to find that the directive had a strong and determined enemy in the new British government. </p> <p>\"Britain went to war to block the directive,\" is how John Monks, then general secretary of the British TUC, puts it. </p> <p>The story of that war has never been told. Blocking the directive was going to be hard, because four countries were required to veto it and there were only three that opposed it, including Britain. </p> <p>The Blair government set out to recruit a fourth - Germany </p> <p>But trade unions in Germany already had these rights to consultation, so German employers saw no need to block the European directive. </p> <p>So Peter Mandelson was sent on a secret mission to Germany as Blair's emissary. He explained to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office how important the British government considered it to get the directive blocked. Kohl took some persuading, but finally he and the German employers' organisation agreed to change their stance, as a favour to the Blair government. </p> <p>John Monks heard about Mandelson's mission from his ETUC contacts. When a TUC delegation visited Downing Street, its members told Blair they thought it incredible that a Labour government should place itself in this position. Blair's reply was that he must keep the business community onside. He went on to say that he did not want the British people to think he was dictated to by the TUC. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, the Christian Democrat Kohl was voted from office, and a new Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, succeeded him. </p> <p>In 2001 Schr\u00f6der was re-elected, and he privately told both Blair and the ETUC that he would no longer block the directive. So it went through, though Britain managed to get it watered down. The British representative at the ETUC, now Peter Hain, abstained rather than be defeated. </p> <p>Britain also led opposition to the proposed directive on agency workers, which would give these workers the same rights as permanent workers. </p> <p>\"The British government blocked that ferociously,\" says Monks. \"We would have it without the [intervention of the] British government. </p> <p>Later, there was the working time directive, which so far Blair has also succeeded in blocking. The directive said that normally no one should work more than 48 hours a week, and that if they did, it should be part of a collective agreement. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair is unlike any previous Labour leader in that he does not think a Labour government ought to enhance collective bargaining,\" says John Cruddas, now the Labour MP for Dagenham. </p> <p>When New Labour came to power in 1997, Cruddas went to Downing Street as deputy to Blair's political secretary Sally Morgan. </p> <p>He had been in Congress House, the TUC headquarters, on the night of the 1997 election, and recalls union leaders' growing apprehension as they saw the scale of the election victory. They knew the stronger Blair was in parliament, the less chance they had of getting a pro-union government. </p> <p>As almost the only pro-union voice in the Downing Street court, Cruddas regularly found himself summoned into the \"den\" by Blair to fight it out with Geoff Norris from the Downing Street policy unit, whose job was to keep in touch with employers and the CBI. </p> <p>Cruddas would put the union view, Norris the employers' view, and Blair would arbitrate between them. </p> <p>\"It was a cold climate for pro-union ideas in Downing Street after the 1997 election,\" says Cruddas. </p> <p>\"There was a lot of empty third way rhetoric, the cult of newness. It wasn't a labour-movement place at all.\" Blair, he says, thought that \"trade unions were endearing in an old-fashioned way, part of the legacy he had to work through\". </p> <p>Cruddas left Downing Street after three years, convinced there was nothing more he could achieve there.</p> <p><b>Hutton: the selection process</b></p> <p>Blair needed someone to conduct the inquiry into David Kelly's death who was not likely to cause him avoidable political damage. He turned for advice to two of his closest confidants, Lord Falconer, the new lord chancellor, and Peter Mandelson. Both came up with the same name - Lord Hutton - but for different reasons. </p> <p>Lord Falconer knew that in judicial circles Hutton had a reputation for independence but also a deep respect for the security services. Northern Ireland judges are loth to criticise the security services, for one simple reason - their lives depend on them. </p> <p>So he gambled that Hutton would be very unlikely to want to criticise John Scarlett, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, too severely. If Scarlett escaped serious damage, Blair stood a fighting chance. </p> <p>Mandelson provided another vital piece of intelligence. When he was Northern Ireland secretary, Mandelson had noticed that Hutton was extremely careful when dealing with both IRA and loyalist terrorist cases to stick closely to the facts of the case and take into account only that evidence which bore directly on the issue of the accused's guilt or innocence. </p> <p>Hutton, Mandelson suggested, could be relied upon to steer clear of controversial issues, provided his terms of reference were strictly limited. </p> <p>Hutton himself emphasised in his opening address: \"I do not sit to decide between conflicting cases - I sit to investigate the circumstances surrounding Dr Kelly's death.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Blairs and Their Court by Francis Beckett and David Hencke is published by Aurum Press on October 29 priced at \u00a318.99.

From just outside his office there was a loud boom as yet another mortar thudded into the flowerbeds. \"I'm optimistic,\" he said. <p>Mr Adil has to be: he is Iraq's chief election officer, the man responsible for organising and overseeing general elections in Iraq, which are supposed to take place on January 31 2005. </p> <p>In theory, Iraqis across the entire country will take part in the polls to elect a new 275-member national assembly, as well as a series of local councils, using a proportional representation system. </p> <p>\"We have a plan that contains a timetable. There are certain dates we have to meet,\" Mr Adil said earlier this month, in his first ever interview since taking up the post in June. \"But if things happen outside our control, well...\" he added, breaking off. </p> <p>Many observers believe holding elections across all of Iraq in just over four months time is a virtually impossible task. Sunni towns such as Falluja, Ramadi and Samarra have become virtual no-go areas for US forces; and already one leading Sunni group, the Sunni clerics association, has dismissed the polls as \"fake\". </p> <p>During a visit to Britain, Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, insisted that January elections could go ahead even if some Iraqis don't vote; in Washington, however, senior officials in the Bush administration are beginning to express doubts. </p> <p>Even the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, admitted over the weekend that Iraq's insurgency was getting worse.</p> <p>In the interview, Mr Adil said he wanted all Iraqis to be able to vote, including Iraqi expatriates, and regardless of any reason why they might have lost citizenship under the previous regime. </p> <p>This month the process of voter registration has begun, based on an audited version of Iraq's ration-card system - a comprehensive database used to distribute food during the years when Iraq was under sanctions. </p> <p>\"We have a problem with Iraqis living abroad. And we need to update our food ration lists. Some people have died. Some people have left. Some people never got food cards in the first place,\" Mr Adil explained. </p> <p>Official estimates suggest there are 27.5 million Iraqis inside the country and another 3 million living abroad. </p> <p>And what about Saddam Hussein? Could he vote from prison or possibly even stage a comeback in January as a candidate, assuming he hasn't been convicted and executed already? \"We haven't clarified the law on this yet,\" Mr Adil admitted. </p> <p>Up until May, Mr Adil, a 47-year-old lawyer and political science graduate, worked for the Human Rights Organisation of Iraq, the country's leading human rights body. </p> <p>Since last year's US-led invasion, he has represented Iraqis who had suffered at the hands of American and British troops, including detainees tortured inside Abu Ghraib prison. </p> <p>Earlier this summer he spotted an advert placed by the United Nations inviting applications for a new seven-member independent electoral commission. Together with 1,800 other Iraqis, he sent off his CV. Numerous interviews followed; Iraq's now defunct governing council appointed him chief election officer. </p> <p>In July he and seven other commissioners - five men and two women - were whisked off to Mexico to learn about electoral procedure. (\"There was enormous security. I went out to dinner to a Mexican restaurant in an armoured car. An ambulance came behind us. When I sat down at a table, the security team made all the other diners leave,\" he recalled.) </p> <p>Mr Adil returned to Iraq, working first in al-Rashid hotel and now in chaotic temporary offices inside the convention centre, the US-protected building in Baghdad's green zone. </p> <p>Like most Iraqi officials seen as collaborating with the US/UK occupation, he now faces the constant threat of assassination. (\"I avoid taking the same route to work. I wear fancy dress,\" he said.) </p> <p>Despite the chronic lack of security in Iraq, though, some believe the chances of Mr Adil holding a successful election have recently improved. Last month the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr agreed to call off his militia's three-week uprising in Najaf and announced his intention to enter the political process. </p> <p>Both al-Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most powerful Shia cleric, a long-standing supporter of direct elections and critic of the Bush administration's failure to deliver them, have called on their followers to create a \"conducive\" environment 'to facilitate next year's polls. </p> <p>They appear to see the elections as the best opportunity to end the occupation - and achieve Iraq's first-ever Shia-dominated government. </p> <p>The elections will be held on a party-list system; one third of all candidates will be women, Mr Adil explained. The biggest problem he faces is to get Iraq's Sunni Arab minority - in towns like Falluja and Ramadi - to take part. </p> <p>Without their participation, the resistance is likely to regard Iraq's first directly elected post-Saddam government as illegitimate. </p> <p>Asked whether Mr Sadr could become prime minister, Mr Adil yesterday said: \"Maybe.\" No new census, meanwhile, will be carried out ahead of the polls because of the difficult and contested ethnic situation in towns such as Kirkuk, which is bitterly divided between Kurds and Turkomens. </p> <p>It will be up to Iraq's newly elected government to convene a national convention to draft a constitution, which will resolve this and other issues, such as the status of Kirkuk and the Kurdish autonomous region in the north, the role of women and the position of Islamic belief in secular law. </p> <p>According to the UN's timetable, voters will be asked to approve the new constitution in a referendum in October 2005. In December 2005 there will be fresh elections for Iraq's first constitutionally elected government. And after that all foreign troops should, theoretically, go home, when the UN mandate for the US-led multinational military force in Iraq expires. </p> <p>Nobody, though, appears to be banking on this. Given the very real risks, why did he take the job? \"I don't regret it. I refused to work with the old regime. For more than 30 years I watched as my colleagues reached high positions while I forbade myself,\" Mr Adil said. He added: \"I want to serve my country. Now is my chance.\"</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices today hit a new high amid fears over low fuel stocks as winter approaches and renewed concern about the security of supplies.</p> <p>Brent crude futures soared to a record $46 (\u00a325) a barrel, the highest price in the history of the International Petroleum Exchange. Prices began to move higher after it last week emerged that US stockpiles had fallen at a sharper rate than expected. </p> <p>Extremely high demand and short supplies have been exacerbated by other factors - including increasing insurgency in Iraq - that have increased concern over the amount of oil available to meet winter demand. </p> <p>Hilary Cook, of Barclays Stockbrokers, said the cost of crude was \"uncomfortably high\", but added that she expected it to cool off again rather than rise above $50. She said she believed the latest rise was a \"short-term hiccup\", caused partly by the impact of the weather. </p> <p>Oil prices had been coming off the boil over the past month, but climbed following new data on US stockpiles. Concern over Iraq, and clashes in Saudi Arabia, have also contributed to the latest price increase. </p> <p>Saudi security forces battled suspected al-Qaida terrorists at the weekend, while a French technician was yesterday shot in the Saudi city of Jeddah - the latest in a series of attacks intended to drive out western investors.</p> <p>Meanwhile rebels in Nigeria, Africa's leading oil exporter, this weekend said they would extend an uprising across the country's oil-producing southern delta, where the Anglo-Dutch giant Shell has evacuated more than 200 staff from two oilfields because of increasing violence. </p> <p>Uncertainty remains over the stability of supplies from Yukos, Russia's major exporter, following the company's battle against bankruptcy, which last week resulted in problems with output and deliveries. </p> <p>These problems are taking place against a backdrop of high demand - growing at its fastest pace in 24 years - which is partly due to China's economic boom. Producers of crude oil are close to their limit, with only Saudi Arabia, the world's leading exporter, holding any significant spare capacity - around one million barrels per day.</p> <p>Opec, the oil producers' cartel controlling more than half of global crude exports, is producing almost 30 million barrels a day, its highest level since the late 70s. </p> <p>The Opec president, Purnomo Yusgiantoro, said the cartel was supplying enough crude oil to the market, and current prices were not due to any market imbalance. \"This is because of hurricane Ivan and some problems in other places,\" he told reporters. \"This is not a supply and demand problem. Opec supply is enough.\"</p> <p>Hurricane Ivan, which has hit the Gulf of Mexico, has delayed shipments and disrupted offshore production.</p>",
  "<p>The number of mortgages approved for buying a house fell for the third month in a row during August, according to the British Bankers Association, providing further evidence the property market has turned. </p> <p>The BBA said that only 64,000 new loans were approved for people buying homes during the month, the lowest figure since January this year, and 22% below August 2003's level. </p> <p>At the same time, the average value of a mortgage taken out by someone moving home was down for the second month running at \u00a3112,100, compared with a high of \u00a3116,500 reached in June. </p> <p>There were also drops in the number of loans approved for people who were remortgaging, with the level 6% lower than during August the previous year, while equity release loans fell by 17%. </p> <p>The Bank of England has increased interest rates five times since November last year, and today's figures are the most recent in a chain of reports from across the property industry that suggests increases have had an impact on would-be home buyers. </p> <p>Last week, a report from the property website Hometrack showed a fall in house prices in all but three counties in England and Wales, while data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed a marked decline in the number of people taking out home loans. Meanwhile, the Nationwide Building Society said house price growth stalled at just 0.1% during the month and Halifax reported a 0.6% fall in prices.</p> <p>The Monetary Policy Committee has yet to rule out further rises in the base rate, but some analysts believe we have seen the last of the increases. Howard Archer, economist at investment firm Global Insight, said: \"Given that recent data and survey evidence has increased the Monetary Policy Committee's concern that the housing market could suffer an abrupt correction, the BBA mortgage lending and approvals data add to the case for no more interest rate hikes this year.\"</p> <p>The BBA also reported a slowdown in total mortgage lending during August, with the major banks advancing \u00a316.61bn during the month, nearly \u00a31.5bn less than during July. </p> <p>Net lending, which strips out redemptions and repayments, fell to its lowest level since June 2002 at \u00a34.4bn, well down on the recent six month average of \u00a35.56bn. </p> <p>David Dooks, BBA director of statistics, said: \"The slowing down of net mortgage lending in August looks set to continue in the next couple of months. </p> <p>\"A further weakening in the number of loans approved - particularly for house purchase and equity withdrawal - in August indicates that households' appetite for secured borrowing is moderating.\" </p> <p>However, while mortgage lending slowed, the BBA said consumer credit picked up during the month. People borrowed a total of \u00a38.07bn on credit cards in August and, after repayments were taken into account, outstanding debt rose by \u00a3582m, the biggest increase since April this year. </p> <p>Consumers now owe a total of \u00a333.14bn on their plastic. </p> <p>Lending through loans and overdrafts was also buoyant with a total of \u00a33.44bn advanced during the month. </p> <p>After repayments were taken into account outstanding debt through loans and overdrafts rose by \u00a3611m, well up on the six month average of \u00a3513m, although it followed a particularly weak July when debt increased by only \u00a3229m. </p>",

  "<p>Estelle has an abscess. Clutching a cheek swollen to the size of a tennis ball, it's clear she's finding talking difficult. She apologises in advance for mumbling and frets that she may dribble. Perhaps this isn't the best time to ask her about black footballer-turned-TV-personality Garth Crooks' recent comments that there is a direct link between rap music and films that glorify violence and the drift of black boys into crime. And yet, after a pause lasting a millisecond, Estelle explodes. </p> <p>\"How the hell can he say that?\" she blasts. \"Film was around before rap music. Bonnie and Clyde were around long before rap music.\" The abscess is growing larger. She's clearly in pain, but there's no stopping the girl whose jangling earrings form a musical accompaniment to her fury. \"So rap music is the role model for violence? Look at what Bush and Blair are doing. It's too easy to point the finger at kids in the inner city and say it's all their fault. Go live a week in Brixton and see how much violence actually happens. Very little! These people sit at their dinner tables with their trust funds and have these views of the world. I am from the urban youth. I make rap music! Listen to my lyrics and tell me I have a link with violence. Argh! I am so mad.\" Another tiny pause. \"Anyway, pleased to meet you, I'm Estelle.\" </p> <p>At 24, Estelle Swaray (surname dropped for professional purposes) is the loudest new voice in hip-hop. She already has a hit (July's autobiographical 1980) and a Mobo nomination for best newcomer behind her. She also has much to say in a genre that, with some sympathy for Crooks, has often been reduced to parody by lyrics about guns and cars. Although Estelle's fusion of hip-hop and soul suggest she is the UK's answer to Mary J Blige, her socially observant wordplay makes her closer to afemale version of the Streets. </p> <p>On her new single Free she pleads: \"Put down your weed, do something with your life.\" Who is she address ing? \"The 2% who believe that life will come to them,\" she says. \"I'm tired of people coming up to me saying, 'I wish I could do what you do but I love my weed too much.' What a terrible attitude. I'm addressing people who sit around and they could be black kids or white kids or people who have trust funds, but it's nothing to do with rap music.\" </p> <p>She may occasionally come across as a fusion of Miss Jean Brodie and Norman Tebbit, but in the cliched world of rap, Estelle is something different. She refuses to follow predecessors such as Salt'n'Pepa and Lil' Kim in accepting the industry diktat that sex sells. \"The only way I'm going on the cover of FHM is in a body bag,\" she blasts. </p> <p>Her background is already a talking point, thanks to a lyric in 1980 about growing up in a flat three floors up from a man who lay dead for three weeks and was eaten by his cats. \"Oh, I had it easy,\" she shrugs. \"I didn't have to find him. My mum went in to clean the house because the council hadn't done it. A woman with six kids should have no obligation to do that.\" </p> <p>Her mother and father came from Senegal and Grenada respectively. Estelle grew up in south-west London in a four bedroom house with: \"My family, my grandma, aunties, uncles and brothers, in and out of prison daily.\" Seeing her uncle \"regularly carted off to jail\" was enough to keep her on the straight and narrow - although she laughs at the irony that he also turned her on to hip-hop. </p> <p>Her mother took no chances by keeping Estelle in the house at night until she was 15 and making sure she attended church. She admits she was probably seen as prudish; then again, the estate's so-called \"bad boys\" were forever popping round for Mrs Swaray's hospitality, suggesting that what embryonic young gangstas really need are hugs and tea and biscuits. Her father built reggae speakers in the living room. \"I sure learned how to be heard,\" she says. A bright child, she sometimes escaped into a private world of books and remembers reading a \"three-parter\" about sex and race when she was eight. \"It's a common perception that kids from black areas have an IQ of nothing.\" </p> <p>Her crucial formative experience - recalled in the lyric \"went to Africa and came back darker\" - came with two childhood visits to the former slavery port of Goree in Senegal. She was horrified by holes in the ground, in which \"three or four strapping black men\" would have been put prior to export. \"That made me realise the world was unfair.\" </p> <p>It took a while before she started putting these thoughts into music. Initially, she wanted to be a lawyer, but she started rapping aged 13 and at 18 began to write her own rhymes. Music had always been in the house - Bob Marley, Yazz, Mel and Kim. She has a refreshing disregard for \"cool\" and even confesses to a love of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. </p> <p>Wasn't the industry itself difficult to break into? \"Not for me because I didn't see it like that,\" Estelle says. \"I thought, 'How am I gonna do this?'\" What she did was make a pest of herself, badgering rappers like Talib Kweli and Rodney P for opening slots. When record company offers came, she was unimpressed: \"I'd read books about the industry, so I knew they were insulting.\" </p> <p>An offer to join a girl band triggered her war on stereotypes. \"They wanted an older one, a trendy, cosmopolitan one and a sexy one,\" she says. \"I tried but I couldn't fake it.\" After releasing her tunes through her own label, she picked up several hip-hop awards. When other record companies came calling, she knew they were thinking: \"What the hell do we do with her?\" \"I'm short, I'm dark-skinned, I've got short hair and I don't have sex with people in the industry,\" she points out. But she has her words, which draw power from the fact that they are \"100% real\". </p> <p>Estelle has attempted to write fiction but stopped after four lines because it was \"whack\". She says she'd rather concentrate on real life than the usual hip-hop fantasies. \"I am not a gangsta,\" she shrieks. \"It's fake and it's too much lying to keep up with, all that stuff about a big car and a Glock under the seat. Everyone I know who has come into contact with guns doesn't want to be involved in that stuff.\" In any case, she feels there's enough drama in her own world. In the stunning Hey Girl, she delivers exquisite rebuffs to a long-term boyfriend whom she now hates for \"messing around\". </p> <p>Occasionally, glimpses of vulnera bility suggest the tough front was adopted the hard way. Has she been bullied? \"All day,\" she says, untypically quietly. \"But I've learned to shut my mouth and choose my battles. I've never hit anybody - I've learned that you can destroy people with words and that's more powerful.\" </p> <p>Her words will take her a long way. Estelle's ambitions are to make an album as memorable as Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation, to run her own successful record label and make a \"billion\" pounds, which she will use to help her \"family's kids and successive generations\" and bring an end to global suffering. It's a grand strategy. \"I'm Capricorn, we plan,\" she smiles - and, so far at least, there's only one thing stopping her. </p> <p>\"I know,\" she winces. \"I really need a dentist.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Free is released on October 4 on Jdid/V2.</p>",
  "<p>It is intended to enlighten, to inspire and to raise public awareness of physics. But mainly to enlighten, and there the problems begin. On April 18 next year, scientists plan to create a global sweep of light to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Albert Einstein. </p> <p>The organisers hope up to 100,000 people will pass a \"light relay\" signal around the world by shining lasers, torches and car headlights into the night sky, starting from Einstein's former home in Princeton, New Jersey. </p> <p>Called \"physics enlightens the world\", the scheme is the centrepiece of the World Year of Physics, a celebration of the subject and its importance in our everyday lives, timed to coincide with the centenary of Einstein publishing his most influential ideas in 1905. </p> <p>But the light relay's organisers now find themselves in an embarrassing row. Their proposal is being opposed by astronomers, many of whom spend much of their time urging people not to shine lights into the night sky because the glare obscures the faint light arriving from distant celestial objects. </p> <p>John Mason of the British Astronomical Society said: \"Of all the ideas we could have come up with to commemorate Einstein's death, I think this one sends all the wrong messages, and I'm sure if Einstein was still alive, he wouldn't be too keen on it either.\" </p> <p>The Institute of Physics in Britain has already said it does not want to be involved: \"We feel it isn't doing us any favours,\" a spokesperson said. \"One of the activities we're planning for Einstein year is a light pollution survey, so it's sending mixed messages to have an activity that's shining light into the sky.\" </p> <p>Data released last year from US military satellites shows that light pollution increased by 24% between 1993 and 2000. Light from freight depots, service stations, ferry terminals, industrial estates, roads, public buildings and private houses means there are only a handful of extensive places in Britain where it is possible to get an unpolluted view of the stars. Astronomers think more than half the British population is unable to see the Milky Way - our own galaxy - from home. Of the 12 constellations featured in the zodiac, five are now invisible in the most light-polluted skies, and the other seven are all missing some stars. </p> <p>Max Lippitsch, a physicist at the University of Graz in Austria, who is organising the light relay, said that concerns over light pollution from the event were exaggerated. \"We expect some 100,000 participants worldwide, having their lights on for less than a minute. That's not much - the equivalent to just a few cars driving with their lights on for the night.\" </p> <p>Darren Baskill, an astronomer at the University of Leicester and a dark-skies campaigner, said: \"The light bulb has been around for over 100 years now. </p> <p>\"If the best example of modern physics we can think of is shining lights into the sky, then it's a sad day for physics.\"</p>",
  "Why are some in the Labour party so keen to write off our second term of government as a wasted opportunity? Why do we keep reading interviews which claim we have lost our way this parliament? And why are there so many conference fringe meetings calling hopefully for a more \"radical\" third term? <p>Don't get me wrong - we do need to debate radical policies for our manifesto. But the idea that the only way to have radical policies for the third term is by renouncing much of the past seven years is a serious mistake. </p> <p>On economic policy, as a result of reforms already introduced under Tony Blair's leadership, radical change is already starting to transform Britain. Over these seven years, we have come closer to making Labour the party of economic progress in Britain than at any time in our history. But we have not only built prosperity, we are building a Labour prosperity. Since 1997, families with children are, on average, \u00a31,200 a year better off as a result of personal tax and benefit changes. The poorest fifth of families are \u00a32,400 a year better off. </p> <p>The Tories claimed that 3 million unemployed was the price we had to pay for a stable economy. We have proved them wrong. The old Tory short-termism and privatisation has been replaced with a new Labour approach: economic responsibility, long-term planning, investment in people, and tackling poverty and injustice. </p> <p>The New Deal has reshaped the welfare state contract between the state and the individual - and we are getting back towards full employment. With Bank of England independence, we have shown the left understands how to deal with global capital markets - and we are delivering unprecedented economic stability. Tax credits are redefining the relationship between citizenship and the tax system - and lifting over 1 million children out of poverty. </p> <p>And before someone pops up to say that these were all first-term reforms, let us not forget that in this parliament we have delivered the longest sustained economic expansion for 200 years, overhauled our competition policies to tackle cartels and made the case for a national insurance tax rise for the NHS. Think of it: a left-of-centre government advocating a tax rise not because we have failed on the economy, but because we want to invest more in our free and universal health service and win public support for paying for it. No left-of-centre government in any country has successfully made that case in the past 20 years. We are. </p> <p>So why are some people so pessimistic about our achievements, so keen to grope for a new start? The problem for many Labour party members in Brighton this week is that, for them, Britain does not yet feel a more progressive and united country. </p> <p>We have made real progress in tackling child and pensioner poverty. But too often we have found it difficult to explain what we are about. And we have not yet succeeded in building wider public support for a progressive vision of Britain's future. </p> <p>The traditional Labour response is to blame the media. But we blame them at our peril. </p> <p>Because too often in this parliament, far from seeing a confident Labour government setting out a progressive vision for our country, the public have heard or read Labour voices running down British achievements and institutions. We have not spent enough time explaining our Labour vision and setting out how it is different from the Conservatives. </p> <p>Too often, the government has been derailed by policy disputes based on confusion rather than clarity. As Tony Blair has said, we must set out bold proposals that suggest new relationships between the state, markets and individuals. He is right to say that the lesson we should learn from our second term is that we need to be clear what those new relationships are, and what reform is designed to achieve, before we announce new policy. </p> <p>And too often the policy debate has been characterised in the media in divisive terms as a battle within the Labour party between collectivists and consumerists, or consolidators and transformers - which leaves party members confused and the public uncomprehending. </p> <p>It is no surprise that the voters get turned off. No wonder turnout is falling and our trust ratings are slipping. And it would be very complacent to point to the \"Iraq factor\" as a simple explanation for growing public disengagement. </p> <p>Britain needs a radical and united Labour government elected for a third term. We are the only political party that understands the challenges of globalisation and that Britain's future is part of a reformed Europe. We are the only party that is committed to investing and reforming our public services and which can combine enterprise and social justice with a reformed welfare state. </p> <p>And no Labour government has ever had the opportunity we now have. Because every other Labour government at this stage in its history was already grappling with economic crises. </p> <p>But we have to learn the right lessons from our second-term problems. First, we should never forget that the economy is the foundation for everything that we do. The 2001 election campaign successfully made the economy the centrepiece. The next general election must make it so too. And we will do more to make the economy a progressive issue by showing that we are taking a new Labour approach not just to stability but to work-life balance, tax credits and entrenched poverty, and to the crippling skills gaps which plague Britain. </p> <p>Second, we also have to remember that the public will only listen to what we have to say about the future if they are persuaded that we can be trusted to keep our promises. To argue that we must highlight our record of achievements is not to reject radicalism for consolidation but to recognise that our record determines whether we are seen as trustworthy in the public mind. And we will need their trust - based on our record - for the difficult issues we will face in the future. </p> <p>Third, when we say we want radical proposals we need to be clear what we mean. Radical should not simply mean different or a rejection of our past. We need radical policies which are worked out, affordable and around which the Labour government can unite - policies based on our values and our commitment to work as a community to fight injustice. </p> <p>The Labour party policies agreed at the Warwick national policy forum in July show us that we can agree on a shared vision and a shared agenda. You don't have to incite division to define your radical credentials. </p> <p>So yes, we do want a radical third-term manifesto. But we also need to win the public's trust and show how the radical steps we have already taken are changing Britain for the better. Only then can a lasting progressive consensus be built in the third and fourth terms of this Labour government. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ed Balls is the prospective parliamentary candidate for Normanton and was, until recently, chief economic adviser to the Treasury</p>",
  "<p>Pensions policy is set to be one of the fiercest battlegrounds at this week's Labour party conference amid deepening criticism of the basic state provision, poor-take up of pension credit and the continuing failure of company schemes. </p> <p>Last night the pensions industry launched its strongest attack yet on means testing, which it says is penalising millions of people who have saved for their retirement while deterring others from saving at all. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers warned that under current policies three in every four people starting work today can expect to be on means-tested benefits when they come to retire. </p> <p>\"This is just not sustainable. Too much means-testing disincentivises private saving. People simply do not know whether they will be better off saving or taking their chances with means testing,\" the ABI said. </p> <p>In a survey to be published today, the ABI says 50% of those questioned would save more for their retirement if they could be sure their entitlement to state pensions would not be reduced by means testing. </p> <p>The survey also found that eight out of 10 people do not trust the government to keep its word on pensions. </p> <p>Last week global thinktank the OECD warned that the \"adverse effects on incentives to work and save\" caused by means testing could pose a significant threat to Britain's overall economic health. </p> <p>Incoming work and pensions secretary Alan Johnson faces an onslaught from all sides to reverse means-tested benefits and improve the basic state pension. The TUC, the CBI and lobby groups such as Help the Aged and the Pensions Policy Institute are calling for a substantial improvement in the basic state pension from its current \u00a379.60 for a single person to at least the \u00a3102.20 of the means-tested minimum income guarantee. </p> <p>Help the Aged said means testing is a \"profoundly inefficient mechanism\" for delivering pension benefits, although ministers argue that focusing on the poorest has lifted 1.8 million pensioners out of poverty since 1997. </p> <p>Means-tested benefits cost 10 times as much to administer as the basic state pension, according to the the Pensions Policy Institute, which says there are about 18,000 civil servants assigned to pensions credit alone. </p> <p>Yet the numbers receiving pension credit are falling far short of government targets. According to the government's own figures, published two weeks ago, pension credit is failing to reach two million of the five million pensioners who are eligible to receive it. The number of new pensioners who signed up to receive pension credit was 31,000 in August, down from a peak of 176,000 in March and less than the number of pensioners who die each month. </p> <p>Mr Johnson is also likely to face calls this week from conference delegates to compel employers to pay into company schemes, in the manner of the Australian pension system where employers are required to make pension contributions equal to at least 9% of salary. </p> <p>Compulsory pension contributions have already been endorsed by the unions. At the TUC conference this month, union leaders added their voice to calls for compulsory contributions, claiming that employers should provide the backbone of private pension provision. </p> <p>The issue is one of the most politically sensitive facing Mr Johnson. If compulsory employer contributions become party policy, and if employees are also compelled to pay in, it is likely to be seized upon by critics as a huge rise in taxation. </p> <p>An employer taskforce on pensions, led by former CBI chief Adair Turner, will produce an interim report in October and it is widely rumoured that it will recommend retirement saving should be compulsory through workplace schemes.</p>",
  "When journalist William Weston was invited to visit the secessionary US west coast states of Washington, Oregon and northern California in 1999, he came upon a society unlike any other. <p>In Ecotopia, all products from houses to shoes were made from sustainable, recyclable materials. Bikes could be found unlocked at every street corner, free to be used and left again by passers-by. Cars had been banned from San Francisco, and pollution was a crime. Locals enjoyed free love, honoured trees and lived in small, sustainable communities. In short, the hippies had taken over.</p> <p>Depending on your point of view, Ernest Callenbach's utopian 1975 novel Ecotopia: The notebooks and reports of William Weston is either an idealistic road-map to a sustainable society or a slightly sinister piece of lotus-eating fantasy.</p> <p>Whatever your opinion, its dream of an environmentalist political takeover has stubbornly failed to materialise in reality. Over the course of the 1990s, Green parties and factions made it into governing coalitions in 14 European countries, but the whiff of power is more often than not the kiss of death for their ambitions. Only in Germany have they survived without either electoral demolition or oligarchic corruption. In New Zealand, the Greens \"tolerate\" the Labour-led coalition government, but are well down in the polls since their high point at the 2002 election.</p> <p>Such concerns must be keeping Australian Greens up at night, given that they are expected to transform themselves from a fringe party to a significant power-broker at the federal election on October 9. How does a party founded on principles of pure idealism cope when thrown deep into the messy pit of politics?</p> <p>Observant readers may at this point be wondering if claims of a Green takeover are a little overheated. According to a Roy Morgan poll published today, the Greens are only expected to take nine per cent of the vote. This will take their representation to between four and seven seats, out of a total 76 in the senate.</p> <p>Not much, you might say. But minority parties in the senate hold a unique position in Australian politics. The Democrats party, an organisation absent in the house of representatives, currently holds seven seats in the senate, four of them up for grabs when half of senate seats go up for re-election in a fortnight.</p> <p>Numerically they don't amount to much, but strategically they are crucial because the government rarely gets a majority in the senate. So if the opposition refuses to support a bill or amends it to shreds, the Democrats - and the clutch of four independents in the senate - are in an influential position to negotiate their own amendments, in exchange for offering their votes to help the bill over the line.</p> <p>Since the 2001 election, they have exercised this power to block 10 government bills and allowed 400 others through. In the fields of unfair dismissal law, media ownership, and further privatisation of state telecommunication company Telstra, they have all used their influence to moderate government.</p> <p>Voters seem to like having a minority party in the senate because it prevents the house becoming either a partisan battlefield or a cosy duopoly between government and opposition. The Democrats' role, as founder Don Chipp proclaimed after breaking away from a 1977 coalition government, has always been \"to keep the bastards honest\". Their main campaign theme for this election has the leadership standing tough like the cast of a cop show above the tagline \"the lie detectors\".</p> <p>But Australia now seems to have decided to trade in its lie detectors for new models. The Democrats are facing annihilation at the next election, with a Morgan poll today showing their support at just 1%, down from 5.41% at the last election and 8.45% in 1998 when their current crop of candidates were elected. </p> <p>Waiting in the wings are the Greens, and their greatest asset is their leader, Bob Brown. At 59, he's the closest thing international environmental politics has to an elder statesman.</p> <p>He was working as a GP in the northern Tasmanian town of Launceston in 1972 when he joined the United Tasmania group, a party regarded as the forerunner of Green parties around the world.</p> <p>A campaign against dam-building on Tasmania's Franklin river in early 1980s propelled him to national prominence and the state parliament, and since 1996 he has been a senator for Tasmania.</p> <p>Voters across the political spectrum like him for the same reason that many of his parliamentary colleagues loathe him: his image of heart-on-sleeve integrity and his insistence on speaking out regardless of protocol.</p> <p>This image got its most significant airing last October during George Bush's high-security flying visit to Canberra. Still obsessed with their feelings of isolation from the wider world, Australian politicians normally treat such foreign dignitaries the way teachers treat school inspectors. Everyone in parliament is expected to be on their best behaviour. In the capital of a country famed for its devil-may-care attitude, \"protocol\" suddenly becomes the buzzword.</p> <p>So the heckling by Brown and fellow Greens senator Kerry Nettle during Bush's speech to parliament went down like a fart at a funeral. The pair were jostled by fellow politicians and received a 24-hour ban from parliament.</p> <p>But when Brown left Canberra and headed back to Tasmania for the weekend, the reception could not have been more different. He was treated to applause in an airport lounge, a standing ovation in a Hobart cafe, and a chorus of approval in the streets.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to think this was simply the result of him running into a lot of leftwingers. Brown's forthright behaviour had tapped into traditional Aussie values of integrity, irreverence and humour that cut across all political divides. </p> <p>It is this feeling of honesty about the Greens which is now propelling them ahead of the Democrats. The lie detectors lost the faith of voters when they used their bloc vote to pass the GST, a hugely unpopular VAT-style sales tax that Australia introduced in 2000. That action sparked a round of feuding, splits and leadership challenges which has seen Democrat support plummet to its current level, where they will be lucky to hold onto one seat come the election.</p> <p>The risk for the Greens is that holding the balance of power in the Senate could land them with many of the same problems that have hampered the Democrats.</p> <p>Assuming the narrow coalition victory that polls are predicting, the government could find itself thwarted at every turn by an implacably opposed group of Labor and Green senators. In such circumstances, Australian governments dissolve both houses of parliament and call another election, complaining about the minority senators who are stopping them running the country. The electorate usually punishes the opposition parties at the ballot.</p> <p>Such a situation could mean the Greens fading from influence almost as soon as they gain it, but the most obvious alternative would be equally unpalatable: for them to give their senate votes to a coalition government which stands for everything they are opposed to.</p> <p>There are other alternatives. A Labor victory would see the Greens becoming crucial partners in government, and a hung parliament could even result in them entering a coalition with Labor. A strong coalition performance in the senate would see them sidelined by a government majority that would turn the second house into a rubber stamp, much like Westminster's House of Lords.</p> <p>Whatever happens, in the long term the struggle for the election will be the least of the Greens' worries.</p>",
  "From the time of King James I, Luton enjoyed a particular place in the nation's affections. Making hats, cars, ball bearings and aircraft parts, it grew to a crucible of manufacturing. <p>But manufacturing isn't so popular today and, alas, nor is poor Luton. And it has now suffered the indignity of being described as the \"crappiest town in Britain\". </p> <p>Up to 1,800 people branded Luton the grimmest place in the country in a poll organised by literary magazine The Idler. A \"brick and iron temple to global pollution\" was how one voter memorably described it. </p> <p>It fell to David Franks, who is Luton-born and bred and the leader of Liberal Democrat group on the local council, to lead the rearguard action. </p> <p>\"One of the measures of how happy a community is how often people volunteer and we have a huge number of voluntary groups,\" he said. \"We also have excellent sports centres, a thriving Sunday football league and great restaurants.\" </p> <p>Mr Franks said a massive regeneration programme was planned for the town centre. Revitalised, Luton will never make the \"crap\" charts again. </p> <p>More than 20,000 people gave their views on the worst places in Britain. The results will be published in Crap Towns II - The Nation Decides, to come out next month. </p> <p>Surprisingly, affluent Windsor takes second place, criticised by one voter for alleged snobbery: \"Townsfolk believe that by living near the castle, they are more or less royalty themselves\". Sunderland: \"not so much a town as a mortuary\" comes in third, followed by Edinburgh and Glasgow in joint fourth. </p> <p>The first poll was taken last year. The \"winner\" on that occasion was Hull. </p> <p>David Woods, the Liberal Democrat group leader on Hull city council, had a message for the maligned folk of Luton. \"My advice is don't look at the ratings,\" he said \"And tell anyone who has them to throw them in the bin.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown wants the \"spirit of enterprise\" to be fully celebrated - not least in Britain's poorest communities, as a solution to unemployment. The reasons are obvious. There are still stubborn pockets of unemployment in many of our largest cities. </p> <p>According to the Department of Work and Pensions, the employment gap in the largest cities is as much as 40,000 in Liverpool and Manchester, 50,000 in Glasgow and more than 200,000 in inner London. Brown's \"inner city guarantee\" is to create more jobs in Britain's most deprived urban areas through stamp duty exemptions, assistance for business start-ups and numerous enterprise or self-employment options in welfare to work programmes. </p> <p>The social exclusion unit's recent Jobs and Enterprise in Deprived Areas report also pointed out: \"One potential route out of worklessness is to become self-employed or set up a company.\" But what kind of jobs and businesses do our inner cities need? </p> <p>A large number of big businesses have been attracted into deprived areas. As the New Economics Foundation argues, however, their presence often creates a \"leaky bucket\" whereby profits are siphoned out of the community rather than being deployed locally. This is the \"clone town\" effect caused by the arrival of large retailers - typically the superstores such as Asda Wal-Mart and fast-food restaurants like McDonald's - and subsequent displacement of local businesses and extraction of large operating profits. </p> <p>But the leaky bucket can also be a leaky argument. There are issues of scale; small, local companies such as those promoted by the NEF and the ICIC (Initiative for a Competitive Inner City) employ far fewer people than McDonald's or even smaller retail chains. Typically, big retailers offer products and services at relatively low prices. On top of that come wages, training, company benefits and, of course, employment. </p> <p>The presence of large companies brings competition to areas that are often captive markets to high prices and poorer quality products. Consolidation and economies of scale are the reality of retailing today worldwide and it is impossible to turn back. Locally owned businesses can take advantage of such clustering, but they need to be able to compete and to complement the presence of such retailers. </p> <p>Competitors of such big retailers have to find a niche that appeals to consumers. Inner city entrepreneurs may have an edge in this regard because their market requires local knowledge. Nevertheless, local economies that embrace a mix of such businesses are likely to be the most successful in the long term: global, local and everything in between. </p> <p>If you wanted to design an enterprise model that would work in deprived areas, providing jobs, creating wealth and generating wider economic and social values, the franchising model is hard to beat. We know it is significantly harder to start and sustain businesses in deprived communities; it is harder to get finance, customers, suppliers and ultimately to make a profit. Franchising is a system that holds the hands of inner city entrepreneurs who otherwise have too many odds stacked against them. </p> <p>Of course there is a trade-off. The rows of neon signs of familiar businesses, even those operated by local people, may still offend the aesthetic and cultural sensibilities of some. </p> <p>The brand names that operate as franchises include McDonald's and other fast food operators which are more likely to be described as villains in the community rather than saviours. But we should be more pragmatic. Not only are some of these operating as local businesses, they are also bringing jobs and wealth to areas that find both hard to come by. In short, the inner cities need the scale of jobs the big retailers typically bring and the franchising system helps to make this happen. </p> <p>Too many other attempts at inner city regeneration have been tried and have failed. There are many places in the US and the UK that have refused to be dragged up to the standards of living widely experienced elsewhere, no matter how much government funding has been thrown at them. But the enterprise-led route is successful, especially if we acknowledge what does work in these communities regardless of our opinions of the logos, the aesthetics, or the calories. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andy Westwood is a director of the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion and author of a Work Foundation report, Who is being served?

  "<p>Jacques Villeneuve had not raced for almost a year, and the signs were unmistakeable. Sweat dripped down his face into the neckband of his flameproof overalls and his hands were shaking as he tried to make light of the physical and mental effort involved in guiding the second Renault to 11th place in yesterday's inaugural Chinese grand prix. </p> <p>\"It felt better than I expected,\" he said, surrounded by cameras and microphones in the Shanghai paddock. \"And it was fun. At least I could push and fight all the way to the end.\" </p> <p>Sacked by BAR-Honda 11 months ago, Villeneuve returned to formula one yesterday with mellower attitude and a simple brief. Taken on by Renault for the final three races of the season, it is his job to win points to help his new team overtake his old employers in the constructors' championship. </p> <p>His failure at the first attempt will not have delighted Flavio Briatore, Renault's sporting director, who dismissed Jarno Trulli to make way for the 1997 world champion. Villeneuve's return at the age of 33 is bringing the French team plenty of publicity, which is almost as important a consideration as points in formula one. Now he has two more chances to make a contribution before departing to prepare for the 2005 season, when he will join the Sauber team. </p> <p>Like his temporary team-mate Fernando Alonso, Villeneuve was able to make use of the Renault's ability to make a lightning start yesterday. Before getting into his car, Alonso had wandered up the grid to examine the state of the track beyond the start line, and in particular the stretch on the right-hand side, along the pit wall. Sure enough, Alonso shot away from his sixth slot on the grid, veered right, and was in third position by the time the field jostled for the line into the first corner. </p> <p>Villeneuve, starting a lowly 12th, also made progress off the start, but his ring-rustiness soon caught up with him. </p> <p>\"The Renault was amazing at the start,\" he said. \"Everybody else was just standing still. I passed two or three cars straight away, but I didn't get into a rhythm quickly enough and I lost those positions on the first two laps.\" </p> <p>Few can have a better understanding of what Villeneuve is trying to do than Niki Lauda, one of a handful of world champions to have attempted a comeback and one of only two, with Alain Prost, who succeeded in winning another title after spending time away from the track. </p> <p>\"That was a normal performance, nothing special, from Jacques today,\" the champion of 1975, 1977 and 1984 said. \"But you have to bear in mind that formula one is very competitive now. There have been a lot of developments and he doesn't really know the car. So you can expect more from him in the next races. He did the right thing to come back now, bearing in mind his contract for next year.\" </p> <p>But Briatore has not hired Villeneuve simply to give him a chance to re-acquaint himself with the demanding environment of formula one. Renault need the points that would mean a difference of millions of pounds when the season's prize money is handed out. </p> <p>They were unlikely to have been impressed when their new recruit failed to resist the challenge of Takuma Sato, who pushed the second BAR into a points-scoring position. Nor was Villeneuve able to get past Mark Webber's Jaguar in the closing laps. </p> <p>This was not the Villeneuve of his first two seasons in formula one, the combative brat who pushed Damon Hill all the way before taking the title himself. Yesterday's performance more closely resembled those of his subsequent years with BAR, when he looked like an overpaid and undermotivated has-been. </p> <p>With Raikkonen, Button and Alonso poised to battle for the crown after Schumacher eventually abdicates, another championship may be out of the question. But the sweat on Villeneuve's brow and the trembling in his hands sent the message that he is going to give it an honest go.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The chances of Greg Dyke's Inside Story avoiding the remainder buckets has taken a turn for the worse. Monkey understands the book - \"Why I'm right and everyone else is wrong\" - has sold just over 500 copies in 10 days in the bookshops. Is that enough to catapult it into the top 100? \"Er, no,\" says Monkey's friendly bookseller. What about the top 1,000 then? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Still, you can't fault Greg's determination to shift as many units as possible. His marathon book signing session at TV Centre is being followed by a \"meet and greet\" in Scotland. But why sign so many books?

So if you can find an unsigned copy get your hands on it, it may be worth something one day. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> A charming cameo appears in the Spectator of an unnamed \"national newspaper editor\" anxiously using a cashpoint for the first time (\"normally I get my secretary or driver to do it\") - a figure identified to Monkey by Sunday Telegraph sources as their editor, the Hon Dominic Lawson.

Then comes Marr's predecessor, Charlie Wilson, who slams him in the Indy as \"the wrong man in the wrong job\" with an \"Alice in Wonderland budgeting philosophy\". But is the book any good? \"Sad and bitter\", informed by \"selective memory\" and \"blaming everyone but himself for his failure\", says Wilson. Apart from that, it's a bloody good read. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> What a difference a Catholic director general makes. \"BBC3 needs to be all about taking risks and Popetown is a risk which we hope the target demographic will appreciate. It fulfils BBC3's commitment to originating animation, while using new and established talent in an untried environment,\" BBC3 controller Stuart Murphy, 21 November 2002, unveiling animated Vatican sitcom, Popetown. \"There is a fine judgment line in comedy between the scurrilously funny and the offensive.

Only last month, for example, Platell recounted how her latest lover had \"performed a certain sex act in a most satisfactory way\" and graphically rubbished an ex-husband's bedroom performance. It's the kind of thing that leads the Mail's Melanie Phillips to announce Blair's Britain is turning into Nero's Rome, but soon Mel P and the Gym Mistress will bizarrely be sister columnists.

  "<p>While the BBC is busily promoting its new eight-part natural history series about the British Isles, behind the scenes ambition and big money are reshaping the genre. A warren of rooms at the natural history unit in Clifton, Bristol, is the low-key setting for the unit's most ambitious project ever - Planet Earth, the epic follow-up to Blue Planet, now in production for 2006. </p> <p>When it was screened in autumn 2001, after the shock of 9/11, Blue Planet gave natural history programming a shot in the arm at a time when Walking with Dinosaurs and computer-generated imagery were all the rage. </p> <p>Alastair Fothergill, executive producer of both projects, says: \"It was something of a watershed - very traditional natural history at a time when people in the business thought natural history had had its day. To be honest, I don't think anyone ever asked the audience.\" </p> <p>Planet Earth, commissioned immediately afterwards and, like Blue Planet, in partnership with Discovery Channel, is seriously raising the stakes. It is the first big series to be shot entirely to high-definition film standards, giving clarity and crispness to the shots. That means, however, that the series must all be new footage. </p> <p>There will be 11 one-hour episodes, costing \u00a31m each, covering deserts, caves, mountains, great plains, jungle, forests, frozen wastes, rivers and swamps, and deep and shallow seas. And Fothergill's team is simultaneously making a 90-minute feature film for cinemas. \"This is the biggest series the natural history unit has ever done,\" Fothergill confirms. \"I also think some of the lessons of Hollywood can feed into it and make the television series more interesting, with pace, style, emotion and narrative drive.\" </p> <p>Deep Blue, the film of Blue Planet, was made after the series, almost as an accidental discovery, but cutting down the eight-hour TV series into a film was complicated. Yet it has become a slow-burning global success, helped by the current boom in factual films. </p> <p>\"What I am trying to do is bring cinema to television. I think natural history is a subject where you can really do that. There is much more justification for seeing a natural history documentary - Deep Blue - in a cinema than seeing Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11,\" says Fothergill. </p> <p>He says Blue Planet's trick, which he intends to repeat with Planet Earth, was to engage people emotionally, rather than putting all the focus on, say, the fascinating lifecycle of a fish. \"We worked very hard to capture emotional moods. One of the problems big natural history programmes have is that they can go on for a long time, and people say, 'If I miss one does it matter?' With Blue Planet, each episode was so different in mood, and the audience started at 9.8 million and stayed very high and the traditional drop-off, which even the best Attenborough series faces, didn't happen.\" </p> <p>(In fact, a classic Attenborough series, Life in the Undergrowth, which is about insects and will be screened next year, is also in production in an adjacent office, and is using the best micro cameras to film its often tiny but intriguing subjects.) </p> <p>The question is whether this emotive approach reduces the informative, even educational, content in favour of spectacle. Mike Gunton, the executive producer of British Isles, has also caught the zeitgeist. He says: \"This had to be a landmark series, but accessible. Sometimes landmark TV can feel a little daunting, too highbrow.\" </p> <p>Fothergill says that being emotive does not exclude being educational. \"The best of Blue Planet did both, with a lot of very hard science. Most of the biologists and scientists we work with teach with it. I think you can marry it on TV, if not in the cinema, but that's what so lovely doing both in parallel.\" </p> <p>From the BBC's point of view there is enormous value in the archive being in high definition. Apart from the ease of using it in multimedia formats, a new production system, Colledia, allows the raw footage to be digitised, coded and organised so that it can be called up by the entire team, modernising the post-production process. </p> <p>\"The hardest thing is that people are expecting to see a lot of new stuff after Blue Planet. But there are still amazing places people have hardly seen. Our crew in Mongolia filmed 30,000 gazelle migrating across exquisite landscape, treeless, not a stick. All give birth within three days, but then they get attacked by golden eagles. We sent a microlight to get that one shot. </p> <p>\"While we were in the Gobi desert, one of the hottest and coldest places on earth, where the wild Bactrian camel lives, it snowed. We've filmed beautiful sand dunes, yellow and red, covered by snow. That will surprise people. </p> <p>\"As in Blue Planet we have the budget to fail. A lot of trips fail and normally you wouldn't risk it, but the prize is that now and again you succeed. Only yesterday, I saw footage of the biggest, boniest fish, sunfish, and they were being cleaned by angel fish - lovely new behaviour. And I've just got footage from the Amazon of blind white dolphins chasing fish onto the sand, which no one has seen before. And from Indonesia, we have got monkeys swimming under water - weird stuff. The other thing that will surprise people about Planet Earth is the scenery - it is unbelievable. The habitat is very important: you may not be passionate about the lifecycle of a marmot, but everyone loves beautiful images, such as glaciers, where there is an emotional power. </p> <p>\"All the time I think about how Hollywood would approach the rainforest, for example, and I am not saying it's going to be like Tarzan, but I am saying that by using photography, music and storytelling, we can perhaps make television that is very engaging. All the world's best mountains in one dollop, animals and scenery, that's quite an attractive proposition.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, in the public service-oriented BBC, this deliberately celebratory series is not going to include lectures about the environment. But the plan is to accompany it with environmental programmes. \"They are still debating the shape of these programmes,\" says Fothergill. The series will be split, with the first five parts screened from February 2006, and the final six in the run up to Christmas. </p> <p>\"We work on three levels in each programme. First, there is a storyline, basic A to B, so in the freshwater programme we follow a stream from the mountain top to the sea. Second, there is the jigsaw storyline, developing greater understanding - for example, why coral reefs are always on the eastern side of every continent. That has to have a global feel, that is the trick. Third, you've got to go for the key stories [such as the baby whale in Blue Planet killed by killer sharks]. You've got to have the hits. </p> <p>\"The problem with natural history is that to do really good stuff is expensive, you can't afford to fail. But the way the TV market is going, towards ever increasing picture and sound quality, is very good for natural history. People always enjoy our picture quality.\"</p>"
