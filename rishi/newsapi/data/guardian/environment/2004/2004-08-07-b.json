  "The woman in the yellow shirt stood up and told of her life-long struggle against being fat, a fight that she had clearly lost. She was enormous. <p>'Every time I dieted I ended up larger,' she said as she broke into tears, 'If I were anorexic or bulimic, I would get sympathy. It is so frustrating.' She was applauded by 100 other very fat men and women. </p> <p>'Here, you are in an island of sanity,' said Professor Paul Campos, author of The Obesity Myth and speaker at this annual meeting of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (Naafa) - activists spurring the backlash against America's obsession with weight. </p> <p>Campos is their hero. His book has turned convention on its head, arguing that there is no obesity epidemic and fat does not have to mean unhealthy. His book has been a huge boost for association members who want an end to the obsession with weight and dieting and the marginalisation of fat people. </p> <p>And fat people are finally starting to win a few battles: Campos's book is rising in the lists and generating a media buzz; the Atkins diet is waning in popularity after its founder's premature death; and former Cheers star Kirstie Alley, whose weight is a tabloid obsession, has landed her own reality TV show, Fat Actress, which sees her weight as a positive choice, not a reason for horror. </p> <p>But Naafa is leading the charge. 'There are few more revolutionary groups in America today and revolution in this area is warranted,' said Campos. </p> <p>Founded in 1969, it has several thousand members worldwide. At its annual conference in Newark last week some members had travelled from Canada and Europe. Delegates sported name tags emblazoned with the message: Dream Big. </p> <p>Naafa hopes to provide a haven for very fat people away from the stresses of living in a thin society. At the conference were talks on how to lobby for fat rights, yoga classes, a pool party, a fashion show, a speed dating session, classes of beauty tips and fitness exercises. In short, they did most of the things that thinner people take for granted. </p> <p>Marilyn Wann, a co-director of the association, symbolises its attitude of be healthy and happy with the body you have. Her T-shirt asks loudly: 'Fat!So?'. She says figures blaming obesity for hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in America are wrong: 'Where are all the fat dead bodies?' </p> <p>She is appalled by the growing practice among the very obese to have part of their stomach removed in a bid to lose weight: 'That sort of surgery is simply stomach theft. Why would any human being need to have a healthy organ cut out?' </p> <p>Naafa encourages members to organise to lobby for legislation to fight discrimination against fat people. Carole Cullum, a Naafa director and lawyer said: 'It is up to us to fight. We are in a struggle.' </p> <p>Wann is more blunt: 'We are in the middle of a witch hunt and we are the witches.' She says that, like most Naafa members, she eats healthily and exercises regularly - yet is still fat. 'I mean, seriously, why would anyone choose to be this size in a society that hates them every hour of every day?' </p> <p>Doctors and healthcare professionals believe obesity has become a global epidemic - and America is at the heart of it. They point to evidence such as the rise in obesity-related diseases, like diabetes. Some studies have shown that 135 million Americans are overweight and the numbers classified as obese have risen 50 per cent over the past 10 years. </p> <p>The result has been panic. Makeover shows advocating plastic surgery are the latest television hit and bookshelves groan with the latest best-selling diets. In the Eighties, newspaper articles on obesity ran at about 60 a year; last year there were more than 7,000. </p> <p>Campos believes America, Britain and much of the developed world is in the grip of anti-fat hysteria. He blames much of this on how obesity is measured, claiming that the standards are unrealistic. </p> <p>He also claims dieting is responsible for making people fat by triggering a 'starvation response' in the body which, when dieting stops, starts storing 'emergency' fat in increasing amounts, a pattern repeated after each failed diet. </p> <p>That was the experience of Mary Ray Worley, 48, who as a chubby child started dieting at the age of eight - but each one only ended with her putting on more weight. Since discovering the association three years ago, she has changed her attitude to her weight: 'I don't hate my body any more. I honour it.'</p>",
  "<p>Britain has the highest interest rates of all the G7 industrialised countries as the Bank of England moves to take the heat out of the housing market and choke off the massive rise in consumer borrowing. Last week it put rates up to 4.75 per cent - they are forecast to hit 5 per cent by the end of the year. </p> <p>But no matter what happens here, an American slowdown next year would snuff out hopes of a sustained recovery in Britain and elsewhere. The old adage that if America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold isn't quite right, according to leading economists. But we cannot escape what happens in the US, says Professor Andrew Scott of the London Business School. </p> <p>'True, if the US goes into recession, Britain will too,' he says, 'but we won't come off worse than the Americans. lt will be more a case of everyone having a runny nose together.' </p> <p>That is hardly comforting, but it underlines the close links between all the major world economies - if one region goes into freefall, as the tiger economies of Asia did in 1997, the effects are felt around the globe. The original adage was coined after the 1930s depression, when Germany and Austria had to pay reparations after the First World War. </p> <p>Actually, Britain did better in the depression than in the 1920s when we had the general strike - caused by aligning sterling to the gold standard, leading to an unsustainably high exchange rate. </p> <p>But as was the case 75 years ago, the US remains central to the world economy, accounting for nearly $11 trillion of global gross domestic product, or one third of the total. 'If there is a US economic correction, it will be impossible for the UK and other countries to remain insulated,' says Scott. 'But the extent of the pain will depend on whether America stumbles or falls flat on its face.' </p> <p>The US is a massive market with 300 million consumers and if they stop spending, we are all in trouble. </p> <p>Arguably, Britain is especially vulnerable as we have always had strong trading links with the US. And our economy is more like America's than, say, France, where the government offers greater protection from 'market forces'. </p> <p>Britain is one of the biggest recipients of US external investment with 'about 39 cents from every American dollar invested in the EU stopping in the UK', says the Confederation of British Industry. But the key to understanding the importance of the US turns on imports. Because America is the wealthiest country in the world, and because consumers have used low interest rates to go on a spending binge, the country is sucking in huge quantities of imports. A major beneficiary has been China, which is exporting cheap goods to meet demand. </p> <p>If the Americans experience a downturn after the election, China and the rest of Asia will find a major export market cool dramatically, which could send their own economies into a spin. </p> <p>That in itself could exacerbate problems in America as the central Asian banks have played a key role in financing the US deficit by investing in US Treasury bonds. If their economies began to weaken, the Chinese, Japanese and other banks may be less willing to fund the US current account deficit. </p> <p>British industry too would be damaged just as it is showing signs of recovery. Although 70 per cent of what we produce is consumed domestically, 30 per cent is accounted for by exports, and nearly half that goes to the States. </p> <p>Just as the Americans spend more in Britain than any other European country, so we pump more money into the States - 40 per cent of all British outward investment ends up in the US. </p> <p>For continental Europe, where analysts say that there are 'signs of a nascent economic recovery', a US downturn could be disastrous. That is because if the US economic engine begins to splutter, the dollar will decline further, and a stronger euro will lessen Europe's ability to grow its exports. </p> <p>But British economists are by no means certain that the US is heading for a recession. In fact, many reckon that American GDP will show moderately good growth next year and the year after, although the pace will be slower than in the boom years of the late Nineties. </p> <p>'I am not expecting a recession, and current data suggests that the outlook is good for the States,' says Dr Linda Yueh, a global analyst at the London School of Economics.' </p> <p>Veteran British industrialist Lord Hanson says: 'People underestimate the Americans - the workforce is well-trained and flexible. Recent employment figures are good, even if workers are taking new jobs for less money. I don't think they are licked, not by a long shot.'</p>",
  "<p>The American election is about terrorism, not the economy, right? The evidence so far suggests so: George W Bush and John Kerry have sought to persuade Americans that they are the 'safety-first' choice. Even economists themselves say the economy is not the key issue. </p> <p>'Is the economy an election issue? No,' says Citigroup chief economist Robert DiClemente. 'It could have been. There were people who thought we would never see the job market recover at the beginning of this year. It has.' </p> <p>But could priorities be changing? Last week a Washington Post /ABC News poll showed 25 per cent of voters listed the economy as the most important issue, with 23 per cent saying Iraq and 20 per cent terrorism. </p> <p>Kerry sought to push economic policy up the agenda on Tuesday, unveiling a health and education spending package financed by revoking tax cuts to the super-wealthy that was designed to claim fiscal responsibility for the Democrats. The following day he boasted the endorsement of 200 business leaders. </p> <p>He would have been pleased to see that 52 per cent of those polled thought he was the more trusted than Bush (41 per cent) on the economy: perhaps reflecting a post-convention 'bounce'. </p> <p>Meanwhile Bush's trump is wearing exceedingly thin: 46 per cent believed he was the right person to deal with Iraq, while 48 per cent chose Kerry. But the disapproval rating for his handling of the economy has fallen throughout the summer, only rising after the Democrat convention. Might he see the economy as suitable ground to join battle? </p> <p>Events of the past week are making it difficult to ignore. Oil prices reached a record $44.3 a barrel in New York. The persistent rise in prices this year was blamed for the 0.3 per cent decline in consumer spending in June, the biggest since 2001. Then, last Friday, weaker- than-expected US employment figures were released. The budget deficit, swollen by spending on war in Iraq and security, is of increasing concern with expectations that it will reach nearly half a trillion dollars this year. Tax and spending plans are under the spotlight. </p> <p>There are also worries over inflation: not just because of oil, but also a global recovery that is happening everywhere at the same time. And then there are buoyant property prices, with talk of a crash in the middle of next year. </p> <p>Could this combination reverse what has always been seen as a remarkably pain-free recovery from the 2000 technology bubble? History shows that oil shocks combined with asset bubbles are a dangerous mixture. </p> <p>Some economists believe the US is on a knife edge. For the partisan who have the election in mind there are two questions: in a year's time, will the winner be glad he won; and will the identity of the winner influence the outcome? </p> <p>Ian Morris, US economist for HSBC in New York, says the winner could be facing very difficult times:'The general expectation is that the economy will grow at about 4 per cent over the remainder of this year and into next. But the high oil price, combined with increased saving, caused a soft patch in consumer spending in June, and the outlook suggests there is no reason for that to change. That will make it very difficult for consumption to grow above 2 per cent, and I think there is the potential for a very serious downward revision to growth - maybe to 2 per cent.' </p> <p>He points to lower growth knocking the employment market recovery and exacerbating budget and trade deficits. </p> <p>Corporate earnings are also under pressure, according to HSBC's global equity strategist John Velis, who believes profits, particularly in technology and banking sectors that account for 35 per cent of the Standard &amp; Poors 500, have peaked, and are likely to be weaker in the second half of this year. But Morris and others believe the property market could be the worst problem. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen Roach recently warned that the belief that America had transformed itself from being an income to an asset economy, where people's wealth and decisions are driven not by what they earn but by what they own, has resurfaced in the housing market. </p> <p>He dismisses the idea of this 'new paradigm' as more dangerous than the last - the productivity miracle and the dotcom boom - because to join in, millions of Americans have indebted themselves, spurred on by low interest rates. Household sector debt in the US was up to 85 per cent of GDP last year, from 70 per cent in 1995. People don't borrow on that level to buy shares. </p> <p>Morris says: 'The bubble has moved from technology to real estate - that is where to find irrational exuberance now.' </p> <p>He adds that house prices relative to income, rent and replacement cost are at historic highs, and believes that the likely upward trend in Fed rates will trigger a fall, possibly a crash. He argues that, while much of this debt is tied up in long-term, low-rate mortgages, it is homebuyers who determine the housing market, and they will be exposed to rising rates. He warns: 'Consumer hard landings are typical in housing busts because wealth effects from real estate are more powerful than from stocks.' </p> <p>These views are not universally shared. DiClemente of Citigroup says: 'We have already seen a major adjustment of the long-term price of oil, and I think it can be dealt with if the rise occurs gradually. The problem comes if you get a $30 hike in two to three weeks. That is possible, but it would need a massive supply disruption.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, he says, the property bubble 'relates really to six or seven hotspots such as New York City, and does not affect the majority of the US'. </p> <p>His optimism is shared by Tim Bond of Barclays Capital, who points to rising employment and incomes, which can withstand what he be believes will be gradual increases in rates by the Fed. He adds that June consumption figures were driven as much by the withdrawal of credit terms by car makers than by the oil price. But even optimists highlight short-term risks. DiClemente says: 'Inflation is a risk. We need to see what the causes of the upturn in inflation this year are - is it simply oil?' </p> <p>Bond says: 'We are seeing a synchronised recovery around the world, and we have not seen that throughout the 1990s when inflation was low. This is why investment in capacity by business will be vital in the coming year.' </p> <p>Bond believes that who wins the election is key. 'The Republicans are so well disposed to the wealthy, that if they win, the immediate reaction in markets will be positive.' But he adds that a longer view is needed. 'There are two reasons. First, fiscally, Kerry would redistribute from the very wealthy to those more likely to consume - the middle classes - while remaining fiscally neutral. That is wise, given the outlook, and reflects the presence on his team of some of Clinton's top economics team: Robert Rubin and Roger Altman.' </p> <p>Second, geopolitically, a Kerry win says America is less likely to be involved in foreign wars. 'This is good for business confidence, which is vital to investment which, we believe, is the key to growth in the next phase of the economic cycle.' </p> <p>In this, war, terrorism and the economy are tied up. The noise from the campaign may be about security and war. But Americans at home and at work may really be saying again 'it is the economy, stupid'.</p>",
  "It was a searingly hot summer day in the Pakistani city of Lahore. At the airport, the usual chaos of relatives, taxi drivers and hotel touts stood and sweated outside the concrete concourse. Broken baggage trolleys lay skewed to one side. Bored traffic policemen wearily searched vehicles. <p>In the throng, no one noticed the clean-cut, slightly chubby young man on his way to the airfreight offices to pick up a package. Nobody, that is, except the men who had been watching Muhammad Khan, a key al-Qaeda target, for six weeks. </p> <p>They had begun surveillance following the arrest a month earlier of a man identified as Musaad Aruchi. Aruchi was picked up by Pakistani paramilitary forces, with CIA help, in Karachi. He had been in touch with Khan regularly. Street maps of New York were found in his apartment, as were some computer disks containing information on other American buildings. </p> <p>It was CIA telephone and internet intercepts that led to Aruchi's arrest. He was held by Pakistani intelligence for three days, before being flown out of the country in an unmarked CIA plane. </p> <p>Then the agents pounced on their next target. Khan was surrounded and swept off the pavement into a waiting vehicle to a high-security prison. The Pakistani security forces, which had resisted American pressure to allow the CIA to run the operation, had reason to be pleased with themselves. The 13 July arrest did far more than take down a one-man communications hub for al-Qaeda. </p> <p>When American intelligence experts arrived in Pakistan and started trawling through the 25-year-old's computers and documents, they were astonished. Khan had been in touch with dozens of other activists all over the world, passing on messages given to him by more senior al-Qaeda figures. </p> <p>It was a massive breakthrough. Laid out in front of them was information that could, if played right, lead them to the heart of al-Qaeda's current operations. Plans were hastily laid. Anti-terror specialists were mobilised. Some of Khan's associates were rapidly traced out. One was Khalfan Gailani, a Tanzanian wanted since 1998 for his part in the bombing of the US embassy in his homeland and one of the FBI's 22 most wanted criminals. Gailani was apprehended two weeks ago in Pakistan, after a 12-hour firefight. </p> <p>As American intelligence officers continued to sift through Khan's records, they realised there was a treasure trove of information. 'It is obviously a very serious victory. It is obvious that there is a real find here,' said Gideon Rose, a former member of the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. </p> <p>Khan, it transpired, had attended an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in the late 1990s and is thought to have associated with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11, 2001 attacks and a militant with extensive experience of aviation. A series of planning documents was stored on disks and a laptop's hard-drive found at Khan's home in a wealthy Lahore suburb. They were surveillance reports, meticulously compiled in a style taught in al-Qaeda training camps, as laid out in the 11-volume 'manual of jihad' compiled by militants in Pakistan. </p> <p>But the most concrete information found on Khan's computer and disks was the existence of five compact files, each one devoted to a separate building in the US. They were the Stock Exchange and Citigroup HQ in New York, insurance giant Prudential Financial in Newark and the IMF and World Bank buildings in Washington. </p> <p>Each document was about 20 printed pages long and mapped out in exact detail a lengthy and comprehensive 'casing' operation that evaluated each building as a target. The files included meticulous logging of pedestrian traffic, the routines of security personnel at the buildings and discussion of which sort of explosives would be best used at each site. The files were written in perfect English. </p> <p>Although it seemed that the research had all been done in 2000 or 2001, at least one of the files on the computer had been opened in January. Nor were documents found on the computer limited to the five buildings. Buildings in other cities, including San Francisco, were mentioned. At least 10 sites in New York alone were found on the computer. In all, there were 500 photographs, drawings and diagrams. Some of them showed underground garages. </p> <p>According to Pakistani officials, there was also evidence of preparations for an attack on Heathrow by British-based activists. There were photographs of terminal buildings and the refuelling centre, as well as of tunnels used by passengers and freight companies. Precise measurements of roads, buildings and underpasses had been recorded. Intelligence sources elsewhere in the region told The Observer last week that the reports had included surveys of underground parking lots so detailed that the gradient of the ramps had been noted. </p> <p>The same sources said the planning also recorded traffic flows on roads around the airport, as well as details of the sequences of traffic lights around the perimeter. </p> <p>Pakistani officials told their American counterparts, and have told The Observer, that the threat was 'present'. They said that Khan had been in touch with six 'jihadi associates' in America. Washington's biggest alarm bells rang. </p> <p>Khan was believed to be a courier of messages between al-Qaeda groups or terrorists. He would receive messages on computer disks and then post them briefly on the internet, using websites hosted in places like Pakistan, Turkey and Nigeria. Though most of the information was old, anti-terrorism experts pointed out that major al-Qaeda attacks were almost always years in the planning. The 11 September attacks were planned for six years and the 1998 attacks on US embassies in east Africa were planned for five years. </p> <p>'I am not alarmed by the age of the intelligence found. I think that just reflects the world view of al-Qaeda operations. They can take years,' said Larry Johnson, a former deputy director of counter-terrorism at the US state department. </p> <p>But, though the material was useful, it was deeply troubling, too. Despite the fact that many of the reports were compiled about 2001, officers around the world knew that a race was on - to find the authors before they could strike. </p> <p>A classic sting was set up. Pakistani intelligence officers prevailed on Khan to work for them. It is not known how he was persuaded to co-operate. The 'deal' was thrashed out at a prison where abuse is commonplace. Last weekend, the young militant finally sent emails to scores of activists in America, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. He requested that they get in touch urgently. As the emails came back, intelligence officers all over the world went into action. </p> <p>President George W. Bush was on board Air Force One when he was told about the news. It was Friday, 30 July, and the Boeing 747 was flying on the campaign trail through the blue skies of Missouri for another stop on his bid for re-election to the White House. </p> <p>The night before, at Langley, Virginia, top CIA officials had been briefed for the first time on the intelligence on Khan's laptops and disks. After 72 straight hours of work by agents and analysts, translating and compiling the information flowing from Pakistan, officials had decided the information was extremely serious. It was put into a morning briefing paper for the president. </p> <p>Bush told national security adviser Condoleezza Rice they had to counter the threat. The operation was already in the works. Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's domestic security adviser, had acted immediately on Friday when she saw the reports on her desk. It was not just the CIA report from Pakistan that was worrying her: another stream of intelligence, possibly gleaned from interrogations of recent detainees, was also hinting strongly that an attack in New York was in the works. </p> <p>By the end of Sunday morning, the homeland security secretary Tom Ridge had briefed the Democratic challenger John Kerry by phone on the threat. He then called senior news executives on various television channels and newspapers in a conference call. Ridge described a 'most unusual set of circumstances where, from a variety of different sources that we continue to exploit, there's a convergence of information that compels us to talk publicly about specific potential targets'. </p> <p>A few minutes later Ridge appeared live on American television to tell the world that New York, Newark and Washington were under threat. </p> <p>British authorities had also been alerted, and moved quickly. It was clear from the start that Khan was likely to have connections to the UK. It is thought that Khan - a fluent English-speaker - had visited the UK a number of times, possibly as recently as November 2002. Khan's father worked for Pakistan's state-run airline, PIA, and had obtained five tickets in his son's name for travel between Pakistan and London over the past four to five years. Khan also had relatives in England, at least some of whom shared his political beliefs. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, British police and security services moved in, arresting 13 (and then releasing one immediately) in north London, Watford, Luton and Blackburn under suspicion of terrorism-related offences. All were men, aged between 19 and 32. No names were released by UK authorities, but American officials revealed that one of those arrested was Eisam al-Hindi, whom they alleged was 'chief of al-Qaeda in Britain'. Details about al-Hindi have been thin. One man arrested last week in a separate raid was Babar Ahmad. American officials want to extradite him for terrorist offences relating to Afghanistan and Chechnya. Ahmad is currently in detention. </p> <p>Direct links to senior al-Qaeda figures among British Muslim activists are rare. However, many have had links to other militants in Pakistan who themselves may have connections to al-Qaeda figures. 'That's the nature of modern Islamic militancy,' he said. 'It's all about who you know. It's about personal connections and being able to source the right materials at the right time to carry out your own schemes.' </p> <p>The vast bulk of these men are British citizens of Pakistani descent, although some are from the Middle East who have been naturalised after emigrating to the UK. Many were active in Kashmir during the 1990s, travelling from the UK to Pakistan to join militant outfits launching guerrilla attacks on Indian forces in the parts of Kashmir that are under New Delhi's rule. Such activities were not illegal at the time - though they now are. </p> <p>Many of Britain's Pakistani community are from the Mirpur region, close to Kashmir, and sympathise with the cause, if not the means, of the militants. Hundreds of young Pakistani-descended British citizens have spent a few weeks or months with 'mujahideen' groups, many sponsored by the Pakistani government, in Kashmir or training in Afghanistan or Pakistan in the past decade. </p> <p>'A lot just did a few weeks one summer and then came home, got married and settled down. They are devout Muslims whose faith is an important part of their identity, but not active any more in any kind of radicalism,' said one Islamic activist. </p> <p>However, there are concerns that more recent recruits to militancy may be missed. Sources within the Islamic activist community speak of 'several dozen' young men from Britain who have made their way to Afghanistan since 2001 to fight the Americans. Such men are far more likely to have contact with al-Qaeda and, terrorism experts say, pose a far more imminent threat than 'old warriors'. </p> <p>Police are also concerned that low-level training of militants may be continuing. There are reports of radical Muslim groups organising 'martial training' in east London. 'There's nothing wrong with people practising karate, but we don't know exactly what they are doing. The idea of small groups of young radicalised Muslims getting together after prayers in a mosque to plan any kind of activity that is based in ideas of any kind of violence is concerning,' one security specialist said. 'No one has the resources to monitor these things and it may well be wrong to do so. It could be totally innocent ... but it is also well-known that these kinds of small group activities are a classic conduit to terrorist recruitment.' </p> <p>Despite the arrests, Pakistan is continuing to provide a 'production line' of new terrorists. Along the Afghan-Pakistani frontier, with their high mountains, rugged valleys and fiercely independent, devoutly Muslim and heavily armed inhabitants provide perfect cover for fugitives. Among these dusty, dry hills, a senior Pakistani military officer told The Observer recently, that up to 600 'foreign' militants are hiding. They included Khan and Ghailani and, almost certainly, Osama bin Laden and his closest aides. </p> <p>Most analysts last week agreed that bin Laden was still alive - and probably in relatively good health, despite being on the run for nearly three years. Although al-Qaeda's leader has issued frequent statements on cassettes, he has not appeared in any new video images for some time. </p> <p>The reason, experts say, is that the Saudi master of propaganda is waiting for the right moment, such as after a strike on the scale of 11 September, to appear on the worlds' television screens. Such a return would have a devastating impact on the morale of his pursuers and lift the spirits of his followers immeasurably. </p> <p>The Americans, the Pakistanis and their allies want to stop that happening. But a major push in March, involving regular US troops, the Pakistani army and Afghan militia forces - as well as specialist American units transferred from Iraq - failed to turn up any substantive leads. </p> <p>To launch an attack 'real-time' data is needed, telling the planners where bin Laden is, not where he was. And even should this be obtained, Bush will have to decide whether to use a cruise missile to obliterate the terrorist leader - and risk destroying evidence of his death - or try an immensely risky operation to kill or even capture him. Recent efforts by the Pakistani army to push into the tribal areas - acting as beaters for the American guns - have failed in the face of concerted local resistance. </p> <p>The Pashtun tribes were particularly angered by the assassination of a popular resistance leader, Nek Mohammed, by an American missile that struck while the tribal chief was using a satellite phone to talk to the BBC. </p> <p>'There are grave obstacles, of course in operating in these areas,' a senior Pakistani general said recently. 'But the real problems are caused by the global situation. We are not fighting a campaign in a vacuum.' </p> <p>Analysts no longer talk about al-Qaeda as an organisation. 'It's as much an ideology as a definable group,\" said one security expert. 'It's impossible to estimate how many people are involved. You are a member of al-Qaeda if you say you are and that makes it very hard to tracking individuals and interdict plots,' said one former CIA counter-terrorism agent. 'There are a lot of very angry people out there.' </p> <p>Another trend picked out by analysts is the increasing co-operation between differ ent militant groups. Until recently, Pakistani militants fighting in Kashmir rarely co-operated with Arab militants dedicated to a 'global jihad'. Increasingly, the groups have become indistinguishable. The same phenomenon has been noticed elsewhere. 'It's all fusing into one worldwide \"Jihadi international\",' the former agent said. 'It's moved well beyond bin Laden or a few guys in a cave somewhere. It's now far more fragmented and diverse.' </p> <p>A British intelligence expert who has advised the government said that there were no 'metrics' for judging progress in the war on terror. </p> <p>'Police and intelligence services worldwide are doing their job - taking down cells, locating operatives, breaking up plots - well, and that is having a significant short term impact,' he said. </p> <p>'But long-term success in defeating terorrism doesn't necessarily follow. Four thousand people have been killed or imprisoned since 2001 and, although the loss of experienced, skilled men has an impact, the vacancies are being filled. </p> <p>'In Saudi Arabia they keep arresting \"leaders\" and new one's come forward. There's no shortage of recruits anywhere and that means there will be no shortage of threats in the coming years.' </p> <p>Perhaps the web of contacts uncovered by arresting Khan will reveal further links to al-Qaeda sleepers in America and Britain. But it also might not. 'This is not the key that will unlock all of al-Qaeda,' Rose added. </p> <p>On Thursday, police in Albany, in upstate New York, arrested two local Islamic clerics. They had been caught after a year-long sting operation in which the pair had believed they were laundering money in connection with the purchase of shoulder-fired missiles. The swoop had nothing to do with Khan's network, but showed conclusively that other terrorist dangers still exist. </p> <p>They may have started rounding up Khan's alleged contacts, but the war goes on. The intelligence agencies continue to probe for leads; the enemy continues to regroup and plan for a new 'spectacular'. And the police hunt them. And so it goes on. </p> <p><b>Combating the international jihad</b></p> <p><b>Vigilance is the watchword</b> </p> <p>Since September 11 2001 there have been 622 people arrested under the powers in the terrorism 2000 act. So far 97 of them have been charged with terrorism-related offences and only 15 have actually been convicted. Of the total 152 were charged under other legislation (commonly relating to identify fraud of credit card offences) or released into the custody of the immigration service. 284 have been released without charge. </p> <p>Spending on protecting the UK from terrorism is expected to reach \u00a32.1 billion by 2007-8, more than double the amount before the September 11 attacks. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are to receive funding for 1,000 extra intelligence staff and local authorities will have additional resources for civil defence preparations. Worldwide, 625 people were killed in terrorist attacks during 2003. The number of individual attacks rose from 205 to 208. The number of deaths was down from 2002 when 725 were killed but the numbers wounded rose significantly from 2,013 in 2002 to 3,646 in 2003. The increase has been attributed to an increase in the number of attacks on 'soft targets' including places of worship, hotels and commercial districts which are intended to produce large numbers of casualties. </p> <p>Despite the threat of a possible terrorist attack on London, tourists are visiting the capital in record numbers. The latest statistics reveal that 6.5 million visitors came to the UK between March and May, a rise of 21 per cent and the highest number ever recorded during this period. Around half stayed in the capital. Passenger numbers arriving at British airports increased by 7 per cent in June alone. There has also been a 17 per cent rise in the number of Americans visiting the UK, something credited to the huge popularity of Tony Blair across America. Last month twenty five million copies of a government booklet, 'Preparing for Emergencies', which gives advice on what to do in the event of a major terrorist attack and other emergencies, were sent out to households across the country. The Government has denied the publication of the booklet is any indication of an imminent attack.</p>",
  "<p>Proposals to build a 50-mile toll motorway through idyllic English countryside are set to reignite the battle over how to deal with the crisis on Britain's roads. </p> <p>Faced with crippling congestion that is costing \u00a320 billion a year, the planned road between Birmingham and Manchester - through landscape that echoed to the sound of war during the Battle of Blore Heath in the Wars of the Roses - is seen as a 'stalking horse' for an era of tolled motorways, revolutionising how we use our roads. </p> <p>To the fury of environmentalists, the immediate threat is a proposed toll motorway parallel to the M6, pitting the clamour for relief from some of Europe's worst congestion against fears of pollution and damage to the environment and communities. </p> <p>To highlight the issues, the Commission for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) has commissioned aerial photographs along the route to highlight the sort of countryside that will be affected. The exact route has not been decided, but it will run along the existing motorway corridor.' </p> <p>Paul Hamblin, the CPRE's director of transport policy, told The Observer: 'The environmental damage which would be wreaked is significant in its own terms, but what it could also do is open the floodgates for a huge expansion in motorway building. We haven't definitive plans, but one could see pressure for widening the M1, M25, M3 and M4.' </p> <p>The M6 Expressway idea was launched to replace a previous promise to add another lane in each direction to the motorway from junctions 11 to 19 - the key link between the Midlands and north-west England. </p> <p>Business and motoring groups are not keen on paying new tolls and would like to see 500 miles of motorway widened, but overall they welcome the idea. </p> <p>This section of the M6 - where more than a quarter of traffic is carrying freight - is one of Britain's most important trade routes, says the Freight Transport Association. 'It comes to a standstill because of too much traffic; it's urgent we do something,' said chief executive Richard Turner. </p> <p>There is no single site of extraordinary national significance to rally opposition to the plans, but there is a string of smaller areas which both the government and European Union consider precious enough to be given protection. </p> <p>The most obvious impact will be the amount of land lost - three times more than the earlier proposed widening scheme, with a 'no man's land' between the two roads, </p> <p>A government-funded study that recommended the one-lane widening rejected proposals to add two lanes each way or build a separate road on the grounds of increased carbon dioxide emissions and pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulates, or from noise and lighting. </p> <p>An investigation by MPs last year found that the smaller M6 widening scheme would lead to a greater increase in carbon dioxide emissions than any other major road-building scheme at key bottlenecks in Britain. </p> <p>'Roads don't cover a large proportion of the land, but their impacts, their footprint, extend well beyond that in terms of the noise, the shattering of tranquillity, in terms of severance of communities, [and] the additional pressure for new development which frequently accompanies new road building,' said Hamblin. </p> <p>This is the issue at the heart of transport policy which successive governments appeared to have accepted, first when the Conservatives axed the road programme in the 1990s, then when Alistair Darling started to move towards road pricing on his appointment two years ago, and latterly in the new 10-year transport strategy, in which Tony Blair declared: 'We cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible - and would not work.' </p> <p>The private M6 toll road parallel to the lower section of the M6 around Birming ham attracted an average of 50,000 vehicles during working days in June, but traffic on the M6 has fallen significantly less than that, notably increasing the overall flow along the corridor. </p> <p>Not all experts believe that the government is planning to unleash more new motorways. Others see the M6 proposal as a one-off way of getting somebody else to pay for a major widening to release the nearly \u00a31bn suggested cost for other major schemes. </p> <p>In this case, choosing the M6 makes sense because it could link up with the new M6 toll road, the operators of which are expected to want to take up the scheme. </p> <p>But the M6 consultation - which ends in October - will be dogged by fears that countryside and communities around Britain will come under threat. 'The government is sticking its toe in the water to see what the reaction might be to a generation of pay-as-you-go \"bolt-on\" motorways,' said Stephen Joseph, director of Transport 2000. 'This is a toe that needs to be stamped on.'</p>",
  "<p>The global economy is 'on a knife edge', according to leading economists, as soaring oil prices, weak job figures in the United States and a potential housing crash on both sides of the Atlantic conspire to undermine business and consumer confidence. </p> <p>As a result of crude oil prices reaching a record $44.77 in New York on Friday, a weaker-than-expected labour market and signs of pressure on corporate earnings, the Dow plunged several hundred points. </p> <p>Anais Faraj, a stock market strategist at Nomura, said: 'The FTSE 100 could end the year at 4,100 - a shade down from where it started in January.' At HSBC, economist Robert Prior said that interest rates were going up at a time when the market was already worried about a slowdown. 'It's a double whammy,' he warned. </p> <p>Some observers are predicting that Chancellor Gordon Brown will have to reduce his GDP estimates for next year. </p> <p>The crude oil price was driven by concerns over tight supply, despite Opec nations pumping at a 25-year high. Meanwhile, job creation in the US faltered, with employ ers adding a mere 32,000 to payrolls in July - far lower than expected. </p> <p>Ian Morris, a US economist at HSBC, said: 'The US economy might tip over if the next labour market report were to be weak again.' </p> <p>He said the Fed might take its foot off the pedal on rate increases, delaying any potential rise in August and possibly September. He believes that projections of 4 per cent growth in the US into next year could be halved. </p> <p>Julian Jessop, chief international economist at London consultancy Capital Economics, said low interest rates and high deficits in the US had 'papered over the cracks' of higher government spending and borrowing, the rising oil price and the spiralling property market: 'It is right to be nervous. If you plug the numbers into an economic model, the impact on gross domestic product is manageable. The problem is that this does not allow for human nature. The risks of a crash have increased; the oil price could be the tipping point.' </p> <p>US Treasury Secretary John Snow said last week that high energy prices 'make the recovery more difficult; it puts headwinds in the way of the recovery'. He added: 'I don't think they're going to derail the economy, but they are a burden on it.' </p> <p>However, the high prices, coupled with the news that the US economy has grown far more slowly in the first two quarters than economists expected, has led to fears that it has not merely entered a soft patch but is threatening to go into reverse. </p> <p>In Britain, retailers will this week renew demands for an end to interest rate rises as fresh data show shoppers are becoming more careful. </p> <p>The authoritative British Retail Consortium sales monitor will report like-for-like growth falling back below June's rate of 2.4 per cent, continuing the downward trend since May. </p> <p>The BRC's director general, Kevin Hawkins, warned that consumer spending in the shops is flagging. The shop price survey recorded deflation on the high street for the first time. </p> <p>A spokesman said: 'The problem is not in the shops, but that consumers are being spooked by the rate rises. They are getting more nervous. There is a lot of volatility around - and when demand is low anyway, factors like the weather become more important.' </p> <p>July was wetter than last year and this hit summer fashions hard. Shoppers are picking up heavily discounted bargains in the sales, which will squeeze retail margins further.</p>",
  "<p>Police and forensic scientists have embarked on 'a thoroughly dangerous' bid to boost the power of DNA fingerprinting, Sir Alec Jeffreys, the technology's inventor, has warned. </p> <p>Jeffreys said new developments in the field have alarming implications for civil liberties, and could allow police to compile files containing highly personal data about a person's racial origins, medical history and psychological profile. He told The Observer, in an interview to mark the 20th anniversary of the first DNA fingerprint, that he was now 'very nervous' about developments in the field. </p> <p>To prevent future abuses, Jeffreys, a genetics professor at Leicester University, wants Britain to set up a global DNA fingerprint database in which every citizen's DNA profile would be stored under strict controls. Only a fingerprint code linked to a name would be permitted. Information about race, appearance, health, and other factors would be excluded. Such a plan has already been submitted to David Blunkett, said Jeffreys, though the Home Secretary had not yet reacted. </p> <p>Jeffreys first created genetic fingerprints on 10 September 1984 when he discovered a stretch of DNA that is repeated in ways unique to every individual (except identical twins). Within a year, they were settling immigration cases and have been used to solve major crimes. Earlier this year, DNA tests confirmed within hours that US troops had successfully captured Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>A database containing codes from 2.5 million criminals and suspects has been set up in the UK to help police pinpoint those who leave genetic material behind at crime scenes. And it is this database that now causes Jeffreys concern. </p> <p>'For a start, we are now putting not just criminals but suspects in our database, and that is clearly very highly discriminatory. If you go to certain places such as south London, you will get suspects who are predominantly black. Similarly you will get a lot of Asian suspects in Birmingham.' </p> <p>As a result, Britain is now filling up its national DNA database with large numbers of blacks and Asians, even though many have no conviction but are merely thought to be likely to offend in future. And then there is the issue of database matching. At present, only 50 per cent of samples found at crime scenes match those in the database. </p> <p>As a result, police and forensic scientists are now attempting to use DNA samples to build up information about a person's physique and ethnic origins. 'Most of this work is simple hocus-pocus,' said Jeffreys. 'Creating genetic identikit picture from DNA samples will take an awful lot of work.' </p> <p>However, research could eventually yield results. 'It will certainly become possible to make estimates about a suspect's ethnic roots - that the person who left DNA at a crime scene is of African origin with a 10 per cent admixture of European genes. This work is already being done and it is ... an invasion of a person's genetic privacy for the police to have that kind of data.' </p> <p>Similarly, attempts to build up facial characteristics from DNA samples could also have serious repercussions. The genes involved in face structure are also likely to be ones linked to congenital facial disfigurements. As a result, police would obtain medical information about conditions affecting a person, and possibly his or her offspring. </p> <p>In fact, abuse of DNA fingerprinting technology is already becoming widespread, he said. 'Investigators can now get your DNA profile very easily - from saliva on a coffee cup or a cigarette butt - and then use it to show whether you are the \"real\" parent of your child,' he said. 'It's illegal but simple to do.'</p>",
  "<p>As crude prices reached record levels in London and New York last week, the spectre of an oil shock derailing global economic recovery began to rise. </p> <p>Prices spiked to $44.77 in New York in response to Opec president Purnomo Yusgiantoro's assertion that there was 'no more supply' to meet spiralling demand. They did not cool in response to a statement later in the week that, thanks largely to Saudi Arabia, the cartel could find another 1million to 1.5 million barrels a day (mb/d) after all. </p> <p>Analysts are agreed that supply is struggling to keep up with demand, and that it is unlikely to do so until next year. </p> <p>David Fyfe of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, says: 'We do see spare capacity within the system as being very tight.' Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES) agrees: 'The worrying thing is spare capacity. We were running at the end of July with 2 per cent spare capacity in the world. There is none outside Opec.' That is why Yusgiantoro's remarks sparked such a reaction last week. </p> <p>There are wider concerns feeding the price. Fears over disruption of supply have been present for months - an attack on an oil installation in Saudi Arabia, political instability in Venezuela or Nigeria, or, more recently, disruption in supply from Russia because of problems at producer Yukos. </p> <p>The 'Problem', says Drollas, is that while previously it would have taken a combination of these to bring serious supply/demand difficulties, now, with things so tight, one alone could do it. </p> <p>The key difficulty is continued strong demand, par ticularly in China, the Far East generally and India. </p> <p>The most visible hot-spot, however, is America, where shortage of oil is ratcheting up gasoline prices during the 'driving season' at a time when suppliers need to start stockpiling heating oil for the winter. In addition, US refineries are already at historically high levels of production - running rates are in the high 90 per cent range. It makes for a potentially inflammatory combination leading up to November's presidential election. </p> <p>Drollas says that America has 18.5 days of supply when it would expect to have 20. The US consumes some 20mb/d. This means it is short of something like 25 million barrels of stocks. 'That is an awful lot short of what they should have in their tanks,' he says. </p> <p>But there is a mystery in the figures. Global oil demand is approximately 81mb/d. With non-Opec crude production at 49.92mb/d and Opec's at 29.36mb/d, plus 3.51mb/d extra for gas and other liquids, total production is 82.8. This suggests that stocks should be building by 1.8mb/d globally, which would normally be enough to see prices fall. </p> <p>So the question is, where is that oil going? Some believe it may be going undisclosed to China or India. Drollas believes that there is stock-building, but because of the tightness in immediately available capacity and the wide range of credible threats to supply, nerves are keeping the price up. </p> <p>So when will there be a fundamental shift? </p> <p>Fyfe points to investment in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Libya and Nigeria within Opec that will see increased production. Outside, he points to investment in Russia, Africa and elsewhere in Latin America that will see non-Opec capacity rise from 50.1mb/d this year to 51.3 next. CGES estimates Opec growth at 1.5m barrels in 2005, so the total figure should be about 2.6mb/d. </p> <p>With predictions for a moderation of growth in the US and elsewhere, there should be a cooling at some point. </p> <p>But Drollas says: 'You will have to wait until there is a decline in demand growth [rather] than extra supplies coming on, and that will not be until next year.' </p> <p>The question economists will be puzzling over in the meantime is, will that be soon enough to avoid a shock?</p>",
  "<p>'The days of cheap energy in the UK are coming to an end,' says Phil Bentley, financial director of Centrica. </p> <p>There is no reason to disbelieve him. Indeed 'cheap energy' policies are a mirage. It is a basic law of economics that what goes down also comes up, usually sooner rather than later. Politicians do not get much credit when utility bills are falling, or at least rising by less than inflation. But when they start to rebound, as Centrica and others now say is inevitable, the public does not necessarily blame only market forces. </p> <p>The gas and electricity regulator, Ofgem, is ideologically in thrall to achieving the lowest possible prices for the consumer. This is an extremely short-term approach which subordinates other government objectives of at least equal importance. There was also more than a touch of emperor's clothes to the magical success of driving down prices in an over-supplied market. </p> <p>This over-capacity was a legacy from the old state-run systems, when it was regarded as a virtue to produce more electricity than the nation was likely to consume. This produced security of supply in a non-competitive environment. Only in the brave new world of competition did over-capacity became a badge of inefficiency rather than prudence, and non-viable generators go to the wall. </p> <p>The most conspicuous victim was British Energy, our leading nuclear generator. British Energy, as its shareholders are beginning to note, is now doing rather well because of the recovery in electricity prices. This confirms that the major factor in its crisis - the unsustainably low price of generated electricity - was a temporary phenomenon. The bill for more expensive electricity, which consumers were not asked to pay for around two years, was passed instead to taxpayers in the form of a bail-out for BE, which will last for decades. </p> <p>Another problem with a purely market-driven approach is its blindness to environmental virtue. It makes more sense under Ofgem's regime to bring dirty generation out of mothballs to meet demand than it does to invest in clean new plant. The wholesale price of electricity must take greater account of the increasingly desperate need for investment in clean generating capacity. But that approach - which would also bring relief to the beleaguered power manufacturing sector - is incompatible with a 'cheapest is best' preoccupation. </p> <p>The classic example of how a hostile - or at best indifferent - regulatory regime can work against other stated government objectives lies in the Combined Heat and Power sector. It is often forgotten that government targets for CHP are more ambitious than for higher-profile renewables. In reality however, CHP has been in decline over the past few years, caught in a ratchet of low electricity and high gas prices. As with renewables, setting targets is the easy bit - there then has to be action to ensure 'the market' does not make them unachievable. </p> <p>So as we move into an era where 'the days of cheap energy are coming to an end', what are the implications for UK policy? I would argue that the biggest danger comes from the proposed dependence, to an extraordinary degree, on imported gas - one of the most volatile factors in recent price movements. Indeed, Centrica is predicting it will cost it 50 per cent more to buy gas over the next two years. Flashing red warning signs do not come much brighter. </p> <p>On current projections, 70 per cent of our electricity generation will come from gas by 2020. Ninety per cent of that will be imported from areas such as Siberia, the Caspian Sea, North Africa and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. No matter what happens now, we are going to become hugely more dependent on imported gas at the time when our own North Sea resources - which led to the short-term dash for gas in the first place - are in sharp decline. By 2006, we will become a net importer of gas. </p> <p>The market is already responding with large-scale investment and long-term contracts. Centrica has indicated its plans to build an LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal to ship gas to the UK and similar projects are sprouting around our coastline. Similarly, a number of major pipeline concepts will bring gas to Western Europe and, by inter-connector, to the UK. </p> <p>So my concern is not one of absolutes but of degrees. Of course we will need imported gas, and of course the market will respond. But does it make sense to become so dependent on one price-volatile source of energy? </p> <p>My own firm view is that our future dependence on imported gas should be tempered by an all-out effort to maximise our indigenous energy potential - nuclear, clean coal and renewables as well as maximising production from whatever is left in the North Sea. </p> <p>Thinking environmentalists such as James Lovelock are already crossing the psychological barrier that sees nuclear power as an implacable enemy. More rational assessment suggests it is actually the other side of the same carbon-reduction coin as renewables. Similarly, we will continue to turn our back on coal at our peril. We still have lots of the stuff under our feet and, globally, more can be achieved for carbon reduction by cleaning up coal plants than will ever come from renewables. As a bonus, British companies could be selling the technology to the world. </p> <p>Security of energy supply is too important to be left to the market and too political to be left to an unelected regulator. Nobody will blame a regulator if the lights go out or prices go through the roof. They will, very properly, hold responsible the politicians who led them to believe in the sustainability of cheap energy and the wisdom of gas dependence. Affordability of energy supply is crucial to a successful economy, but 'cheap energy' is fool's gold. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Brian Wilson MP was Energy Minister from 2001 to 2003 and is currently the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Overseas Trade</p>",
  "<p><strong>The 9/11 Commission Report</strong><br>WW Norton &amp; Co \u00a36.99, pp567</p> <p>In August 2001, the Minneapolis office of the FBI contacted headquarters in Washington to request a warrant to search the laptop computer of Zacarias Moussaoui, a French national with known Islamic extremist views being held in the Midwest city on immigration charges.</p> <p>An intelligence investigation into Moussaoui had been instigated after agents learned he had taken flying lessons at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minnesota, as 'an ego-boosting thing'. They found he had an inexplicable $32,000 in his bank, was planning to sign up for martial arts training and buy a global positioning receiver. He paid $9,000 to be trained how to fly an airliner from London Heathrow to New York's John F Kennedy and showed particular interest in the workings of aircraft doors. The field office concluded he was 'an Islamic extremist preparing for some future act in furtherance of radical fundamentalist goals'.</p> <p>But when a supervisor at Minneapolis pushed the request for a warrant, headquarters complained he was just trying to get people 'spun up'. The supervisor, now furious, said this was precisely his intention and he was 'trying to keep someone from taking a plane and flying it into the World Trade Centre'. Washington said this was not going to happen and they had no evidence Moussaoui was a terrorist.</p> <p>Throughout August 2001, agents at Minneapolis were still desperately trying to warn HQ about Moussaoui, but the information was never passed up the chain of command.</p> <p>The banal everyday frustration of FBI office politics is part of what makes the Moussaoui story so compelling. As in every good thriller, the little man has to struggle against sceptical bosses who just don't understand the deadly threat facing them. Despite knock-backs, humiliation, and a growing conviction they are going insane, the employee perseveres and uncovers an international plot to hit at the heart of the American state. Tragically, the plot of the suicide attacks on America didn't follow a Hollywood script. No one listened to the little man.</p> <p>The story of the Minneapolis warnings and the catastrophic intelligence failure that led up to the attacks is told with relish by the authors of The 9/11 Commission Report.</p> <p>Borrowing a technique from the intelligence services, publishers WW Norton refused to confirm or deny to The Observer whether the report was rewritten by John Grisham or Robert Ludlum to give it some narrative muscle. They claim is was the joint work of the Commission's Republican and Democrat members.</p> <p>But I'd like to know which veteran member of Congress wrote the opening lines: 'Tuesday September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States.

  "<p>There's not a greasy burger in sight. These days, McDonald's is for ladies who lunch: the fast food giant currently features attractive, sophisticated thirty-something women in its adverts, laughing over their McSalad-leaves. </p> <p>And what's this? Wholesome-sounding 'educational' ads on children's TV, 'using songs to help children learn about eating smart and being active', presented by... Ronald McDonald. </p> <p>If this seems inappropriate, the point hasn't been lost on politicians and health campaigners. 'I'm very sceptical about this projection of a healthy message by McDonald's,' says David Hinchliffe, chairman of the House of Commons health committee. 'It would be better if they were looking at the energy content of their food, and the pressure they bring to bear on children and young people to consume a less than healthy product.' </p> <p>His committee recently declared the 'epidemic' of obesity one of Britain's most urgent public health problems. In America, McDonald's is fending off lawsuits from large-waisted former customers. And the burger-and-chips behemoth has also just been traduced by a New York film-maker who recorded his own descent into serious illness while living on a McDonald's-only diet. Super Size Me, a surprise hit in the US, hits British cinemas soon. </p> <p>So is McDonald's much-publicised conversion to salad, sport and mineral water just a desperate rearguard action against bad PR? Or is it a ruse to get more punters to the burger counter? </p> <p>Not at all, says Amanda Pierce, McDonald's spokeswoman in Britain. 'There's a heck of a lot of variety in the menu now, and we're trying to make sure that McDonald's is relevant and contemporary. We're a restaurant business and we have to recognise that our customers' tastes and expectations have changed.' </p> <p>McDonald's may be the one of the most successful brands in history but, in strictly commercial terms, it needs revamping. Under pressure from pizza and tex-mex chains, and perceived as out of step with an increasingly body-conscious society, in 2002 the Chicago-based corporation announced its first loss for decades. Its response was to ditch the age-old strategy of neverending global expansion and concentrate on improving the 30,000 restaurants it already had. </p> <p>The company promised to reduce artery-clogging 'trans-fats' in its frying oil. 'Healthier' items were added to the menu - salads, grilled chicken, fruit and yoghurts. Some gigantic burgers and drinks cartons have been downsized. </p> <p>The strategy seems to have worked: before his untimely death earlier in April, McDonald's chief executive Jim Cantalupo delivered an annual turnover of $17 billion, increasing profits and a near-doubling of the share price. Business is booming, not least in the chain's 1,200 British outlets. </p> <p>But people aren't going to the 'golden arches' for apples and lettuce. Our appetite for salty snacks and sugary drinks remains undimmed, as this year's government White Paper on obesity is expected to show. Britons are getting fatter faster than any of their European counterparts, with one in five adults now classed as dangerously overweight, and a quarter of children under 10 at risk of heart disease and diabetes in later life. </p> <p>In the US, the proportion of overweight adults has soared to about 65 per cent. The World Trade Organisation blames the food industry, and JP Morgan recently warned that Big Food faced a future of restricted marketing and massive health compensation claims. </p> <p>The industry's biggest companies are scrambling to head off the threat, cutting portion sizes and reviewing ingredients, and McDonald's, the best-known name in fast food, is no different. It has been handing out 'stepometers' to encourage customers to exercise, sponsoring the Olympic Games and England's football team, and pouring millions into Every Step Counts, an exercise campaign fronted by athletes Darren Campbell and Sharron Davies. </p> <p>None of which changes the fact that many items in its salad menu contain even more fat and calories than some of its burgers. Just in case voluntary 'improvements' don't protect it, the food industry has lobbied strenuously for the 'cheeseburger bill', which was passed in March by the US House of Representatives and restricts the ability of Americans to sue food companies for making them fat. Whether the bill will be ratified by the Senate, is another matter. </p> <p>McDonald's has so far managed to repel obesity lawsuits in the US by appealing to common sense. 'Nobody is forced to eat at McDonald's,' said one judge in a recent verdict. 'It is not the place of the law to protect people from their own excesses'. The same judge, however, did not rule out the chance of other junk food lawsuits succeeding, and increasingly it is argued that some people are actually not in a position to choose what they eat wisely. </p> <p>Children, for example. Last month health groups were disappointed by Ofcom's decision not to ban junk food advertising during children's TV programmes. Younger customers are a core market for companies such as McDonald's, and the media regulator said such a ban would threaten the commercial viability of children's TV, as well as being ineffective. Still, the government is keeping an open mind on a ban. </p> <p>Whether fast food companies improp erly target children in their advertising is a debating point of long standing, but it becomes hugely pertinent if the product is found to be addictive. Recent scientific research suggests that a combination of high-fat and high-sugar foods creates biochemical reactions in the body similar to those in people addicted to cigarettes. </p> <p>If verified, the research could undermine McDonald's claim that people are responsible for their own overeating. Unsurprisingly, this is an issue that fascinates America's lawyers. Tobacco firms there have already been forced to pay tens of billions of dollars in compensation after being accused of marketing highly addictive products and failing properly to warn the public about health risks. </p> <p>John Banzhaf, a US attorney who helped spearhead much of the anti-tobacco litigation, has since piloted legal actions against McDonald's. He estimates that the burger giant could one day face compensation demands totalling between $50bn and $100bn. Much of this, Banzhaf says, could come from America's healthcare system, which spends around $120bn each year treating people for obesity-related illnesses. </p> <p>It's a thought to wipe the smile off even Ronald's face.</p>",
  "<p>Like Mickey Mouse, Walt Disney's European theme park has spent years lurching from one outlandish mishap to another. But while the canny rodent usually wins through in the end, Euro Disney just keeps falling on its face. </p> <p>And there's nothing funny about \u20ac2 billion (\u00a31.3bn) of debt. Last week Euro Disney, which operates the Disneyland Paris park, announced yet another delay to its financial rescue plan, as well as another disappointing set of trading figures. It has until the end of September to reach agreement with 'certain lenders' or face going out of business. </p> <p>This is the second financial restructuring in the Paris-based theme park's 12-year history. In that time it has endured disappointing visitor numbers, huge development costs and constant sniping from the critics. Euro Disney was worth more than \u20ac4 billion in 1992; its shares, traded in Paris, have since sunk to below \u20ac0.30, valuing the company at about \u20ac300m. </p> <p>Dreams of recreating the rip-roaring success of the original Disney parks in Florida and California crumbled long ago. 'I never thought Euro Disney had much chance of success,' says Hilary Cook, an analyst at Barclays Stockbrokers. 'It's quite expensive.

What I'm saying may sound nebulous, but over there it's acceptable to have men running around in Donald Duck suits. It doesn't look so comfortable in Europe.' </p> <p>For the Walt Disney Corporation, fantasy has become nightmare. The US media giant is owed more than anybody, but can't pull the plug on such a high-prestige product, not least because it still owns 39 per cent of Euro Disney. Still, the spectre of insolvency is being brandished to get other creditors to the negotiating table. They include BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and 'several dozen' others. </p> <p>The restructuring proposals will mean a dilution of existing shareholders' stakes and a \u20ac250m rights offering. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire who has a 16 per cent holding, appears reluctant to deepen his involvement, in spite of lobbying from Euro Disney's management. </p> <p>Last year the company lost \u20ac56m; further losses are predicted this year, and shareholders and creditors alike may be hoping that the Walt Disney Corporation will step in and buy them out. </p> <p>Brinkmanship is also directed at the French government, which may have too much riding on Euro Disney to allow it to fail. The state-owned Caisse des Depots et Consignations, which is among the theme park's biggest creditors, has agreed to defer interest payments. But further state aid would almost certainly not be tolerated by the European Union. </p> <p>Euro Disney was launched with an unprecedented fanfare, and its biggest problem ever since may have been over-expectation. For much of the past decade, the park has hosted about 12 million visitors a year, twice as many as the Eiffel tower and enough to make it easily Europe's number one short-break destination. But the long-standing target of 17 million has never been reached and revenues from Disney's numerous hotel, restaurant and conferencing facilities in the vicinity seldom impress. </p> <p>Disney Studios, a second park close to the existing site, cost \u20ac600 million to build, but has failed so far to attract extra visitors in any number, having been opened in April 2002, in the middle of the post-11 September tourist slump. </p> <p>The unfortunate timing was an uncanny reminder of Disneyland Paris's original launch just after the first Gulf war. Initial tourist numbers were disappointing, with Euro Disney struggled to cover its construction costs, and in 1994 the company agreed to a Fr1.6 billion rescue package, which saw Alwaleed as the biggest investor. A period of stability and profitability followed in the late Nineties - but then came global terrorism. </p> <p>Some have wondered if the resort might have been more profitably sited in Spain. Its present location offers useful rail links to London, Brussels, Geneva and Marseille. But, much more than its counterparts in the States, Disneyland Paris had to share the tourists with its host city's many attractions. </p> <p>Disneyland is looked upon favourably by the French - after all, it has created 12,000 jobs- but has endured spasms of anti- American feeling since being criticised in its early days for a centralised booking system that didn't offer many opportunities to local tour agents. Many European visitors were also unpleasantly surprised by such imported features as the park's no-alcohol rule. </p> <p>The second Paris park, dedicated to the history of cinema, was designed to offer slightly higher-brow entertainment and make Disney look less of a fish out of water. </p> <p>Like all entertainment brands, Disneyland Paris is constantly engaged in the expensive business of reinventing itself, as well as competing with the 'white-knuckle rides' increasingly on offer from rivals all over the continent. </p> <p>Last year, Walt Disney waived its management and royalty fees in a bid to take pressure off the firm. 'But for years the parent company was seen as too greedy about what it was creaming off,' says Cook. 'Certainly, it took a very big slug out of the royalties.' </p> <p>If so, it may have to pay for that now.</p> <p><strong>Cartoon capers</strong></p> <p><strong>1987:</strong> Euro Disney theme park conceived, sparking subsidy war among European states </p> <p><strong>1992: </strong>Opens in Paris and is immediately plagued by financial difficulties </p> <p><strong>1994: </strong>Restructures its debts, park renamed Disneyland Paris </p> <p><strong>2002: </strong>Disney Studios opens near by; terror fears lead to tourist slump </p> <p><strong>2003: </strong>Company declares it cannot service its debts </p> <p><strong>2004: </strong>Frantically tries to negotiate another financial restructuring</p>",
  "<p>A few months ago, my father came across a handwritten letter that had been sent to his grandfather in February 1884. The letter was from a man called CW Allcock who was then in charge of the English Football Association. It had informed my great-grandfather, Billy Rose, England's goalkeeper, of the arrangements for the forthcoming international against Ireland. 'I enclose your ticket for Belfast via Holyhead,' the note read, 'train leaves Euston at 8.25am tomorrow.' The letterhead, 'The Football Association', had been written by hand, and roughly underlined. There was a hasty PS noting a change of hotel arrangements. And that was that. </p> <p>This week, deafened by the white noise surrounding Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's latest, comical tryst, numbed from phone-ins and talk shows and all those endless back pages and front pages with their rubbish puns and their hilarious moralising, I was reminded of that little note. There seemed something quaint about it, of course, but also something likeably straightforward. </p> <p>The Football Association, then in its infancy, had been going about its business, doing what it was set up to do. It was organising a match, the travel arrangements were sorted, the players knew where they were staying. What more was there to worry about? </p> <p>Mark Palios, CW Allcock's latest successor at the FA, could have pointed, in his short reign as chief executive, at plenty. Even before he handed over a girlfriend to his head coach, there had been the scandal of England defender Rio Ferdinand's missed drugs test, the threat of a players' strike, the struggle to keep Eriksson as long as possible (and then, apparently, to ditch him as quickly as possible). Moreover, there was the constant worry of manipulating a favourable angle on these events in the newspapers. </p> <p>In this latter effort, you could certainly say, the FA failed spectacularly. By the time, this week, that the broadsheets and the BBC decided to adopt the agenda of the News of the World and lead with the 'revelations' at Soho Square, it had become clear that what we were witnessing was not a scandal of sex ('man has dalliance with secretary shock') or of incompetence (though the FA has shown plenty of that) but rather a scandal of scale, of proportion, of perspective. </p> <p>It seems almost pointless to point out the hypocrisy of the popular press, given that in its self-righteous voyeurism it seems so close to the public mood. The spectacle of sports hacks turning all their five o'clock cliches on to the overpaid, overlunched suits of the FA is simply the latest demonstration of the mob mentality that passes for public debate. </p> <p>For a while now this voice has felt most comfortable and most sanctimonious when it can shout about football and sex and money and nationality, preferably all in the same breath. </p> <p>Even so, it is still mildly alarming, once this national slanging match takes a hold, to discover where it can lead. Jeff Powell, of the Daily Mail, wrote with some zeal of the necessity of 'Eriksson being sluiced away as the Soho Square cesspit is disinfected'. But even as the Swede was to be expunged and all trace of his monstrous carnal crimes wiped clean, there were further dangers at large. England footballers, who half-threatened to strike to protect the priapic urges of their gaffer, should be prevented, Powell argued, from any 'attempt to interfere in the affairs of state'. </p> <p>Since when did a ruckus in the bedrooms and boardrooms of English football amount to 'the affairs of state'? My colleague Will Buckley's timely and funny novel, The Man who Hated Football, about a sports journalist who has seen one too many games of two halves, parodies perfectly just this kind of hyperbole - and despairs at a population that routinely dresses in football kit, and which believes that the day's most pressing national news is the marital disharmony of an England footballer. </p> <p>Far from providing a sanguine balance to this mania, the Football Association has long enjoyed the benefits of believing the hype. On a wave of self-congratulation it moved itself into its flash offices in Soho Square and decided to pay its executives more than the CEOs of major corporations. </p> <p>When people talk, as they endlessly - stupefyingly - do about football being a global business, they are really talking about it being awash, like most global businesses, with unfairly distributed cash. In the manner of Labour politicians agog at the remuneration of fat cats, football administrators seem to like to imagine themselves on a level with the dodgy plutocrats who own the clubs. To justify these rewards they have to create a culture of self-importance. </p> <p>In his classic study of play, Homo Ludens, the social historian John Huizinga argued that in our times, 'a far-reaching contamination of play and serious activity has taken place. In activities of an outwardly serious nature hides an element of play. Recognised play, on the other hand, is no longer able to maintain its true play character as a result of being taken too seriously and being technically over-organised. The indispensable qualities of detachment, artlessness, and gladness are thus lost.' </p> <p>You may see many attributes in the engorged fantasy of the Premiership, which kicks off again in absolute earnest next week, but artlessness and gladness will not be among them. </p> <p>Whereas Rupert Murdoch's Sky money inflated football beyond the affordable budget of the most of us, it also lent it a pomposity - the 'national game' - that it scarcely deserved. Roman Abramovich's billions have warped the reality of the upper reaches of the sport still further. The Russian has offered football the pornographic pull of extreme wealth. In doing so, it goes without saying, he has taken a good deal more of the fun out of it. </p> <p>The FA might have seen its role as trying to spread some of this impossible wealth throughout the game. Instead, in a show of towering hubris - and much in the way it overreached itself with the scandalous extravagance of the new Wembley - it believed it could compete with Abramovich financially. Thus in March when Sven was being courted by the Chelsea owner, the absurd Swede was granted the deal which earns him \u00a34 million per year. Not only was this money 10 times what Eriksson's counterpart in France, the coach of the best team in the world, was earning. It was also money - like the three quarters of a billion pounds lavished on Wembley - that could have been properly invested in the junior reaches of the game, which the FA is supposed to nurture and champion. There are, however, as the likes of Mark Palios and the 'great survivor' David Davies would be quick to point out, not many headlines in that. </p> <p>As an antidote to the enervating nonsense of Svengate, the summer has happily provided a good example of what sport might really be about. While football's sordid stories have once again dominated the headlines, the English cricket team, not particularly overpaid, or overhyped, but quite artless and detached and full of genuine characters and actually rather good, has given us a timely reminder that there has always been more than one national game. John Arlott, the great cricket broadcaster, once suggested grudgingly: 'There are good people in football, but they're outnumbered 200 to one.' On current form, he might have judged himself guilty of understatement.</p>",
  "Every summer the graduates of Britain's universities decide what to do with their lives. As in previous years, thousands will have rejected the ideals of public service and the excitement of setting-up their own businesses and decided instead to fill the gaps in the ranks of Britain's 250,000 accountants. <p>Britain has as many as the rest of the EU put together, and it's easy to see why. There's no state-guaranteed monopoly for engineers, factory workers, call-centre girls, small businessmen or women, computer programmers, inventors or any other wealth-creating trade. Indeed, when the working population's jobs head east they are told in thunderous voices that their sloth is being deservedly punished by the wrathful gods of the marketplace. But auditing can't go east. Every institution in Britain has to have its books audited by a member of one of the British accountancy associations.</p> <p>In theory they are the police officers of finance, forever on the lookout fraud and gross incompetence. In practice they differ from the police in one respect. Detectives are not allowed to sell 'extra services' to potential criminals. They might think twice before breaking up an international cocaine-smuggling racket if their force relied on that same ring for a large slice of its income. No similar pettifogging concerns about conflicts of interest constrain the accountancy racket. Accountants are free to sell advice on how to install IT or avoid taxes to the very managers they are meant to be policing on behalf of pension funds and employees. If they blow the whistle, they might lose the contracts, so the whistle has a tendency to stay in the pocket. </p> <p>It shouldn't be a surprise to learn that British accountants make a comfortable living. Management Today found that the average annual pay packet of British accountants in 2001 came to $117,000 (\u00a382,000), which was way ahead of their nearest rivals in Europe, the Swiss, who struggled to get by on $73,000 (\u00a351,000). </p> <p>Thrusting graduates have always aimed to hack their way to the top of one of the 'Big Four' accountancy firms - PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG or Deloitte - which dominate the global and British markets. The most ambitious will hope one day to emulate Mike Rake, the head of KPMG, who last year received a 45 per cent pay rise to take his salary to \u00a32.4 million. </p> <p>'What do you spend it on?' a reporter from the Sunday Times asked. 'Sixteen polo ponies,' Rake replied.</p> <p>In the past, Rake and his colleagues were partners who had unlimited liability for their partnership's debts. Like the Lloyd's names, they put everything they owned on the line, and their exposure must have caused the odd sleepless nights. Auditors had approved the accounts of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Enron, WorldCom, Equitable Life and many another grotesquely mismanaged company. Until New Labour came to power the threat that Rake and his fellow partners might be sued for presiding over a disaster should have troubled even the self-confident head of KPMG. Everything, the pied-\u00e0-terre in London, the home in Henley-on-Thames, the villa in Spain and the 16 polo ponies, could have gone. </p> <p>The example of Arthur Andersen provided a terrible warning. The Big Four were once the Big Five until Andersen approved the accounts of Enron and WorldCom and earned the imperishable distinction of failing to notice that the first and second biggest frauds in human history were going on under its nose. Andersen went bust because, understandably, no reputable organisation would go near it. The Bush administration reacted by making it all but impossible for auditors to sell other services to clients in the United States. What if Parliament was to enforce the same regulations here? </p> <p>If Enron wasn't bad enough, what of the policy holders of Equitable Life who are suing Ernst &amp; Young for several billion for their failure to warn that the mutual was heading towards a financial calamity? </p> <p>I don't know if Rake suffers from panic attacks. If he does, he will at least be able to reassure himself on one point: however calamitously the accountancy giants audit British business, his polo ponies will be safe. As this column has noted before, the most striking vice of New Labour is not its friendship with business - all modern governments have to make friends with business - but its anxiety to acquaint itself with the most notorious capitalists: the Mittals, the Hindujas, the Murdochs and, now I think of it, the Arthur Andersens. The Tories had banned Andersen from receiving government contracts after its perennially myopic auditors had failed to spot that tax-payers money was disappearing by the boot load from the DeLorean car plant in Belfast. </p> <p>Andersen responded by sucking-up to New Labour and waiting for a change of regime. Patricia Hewitt was hired by its consulting arm. Andersen's services were offered free of charge to Labour when it was in Opposition. When Tony Blair won the 1997 election, the unpleasantness about DeLorean was tidied away and government contracts began to flow Andersen's way again. In 2000, the government bowed to a long campaign by the accountancy giants and limited their liability. Partners could protect themselves by changing their partnership into a limited company. Better still, they could still be partners and retain all the tax advantages and freedom from public scrutiny partnerships brought until they were successfully sued - when they would be able to claim the immunities of the directors of limited companies. The personal assets of the partners - the pads in Chelsea, the piles in the Chilterns - couldn't be seized by bailiffs whatever alternative they choose. </p> <p>The old wisdom about never giving into bullies has held true. The Big Four weren't satisfied with the government's gracious treatment and upped their demands. With personal liability gone, they now want a cap on the damages their firms can be required to pay for negligence or fraud. If they don't get it, they warn that one of their number could go bust. The Big Four would become the Big Three and the group would offer an even less competitive service to the business world. As Rake put it, business 'can't afford to lose another accountancy firm'. </p> <p>From inside the City the apparently outrageous demand for benefit of the clergy for accountants makes a kind of sense. What, after all, are the Big Four worth? Their offices in central London should be fetch a fair price, and photocopiers, computer terminals and the rest. But what was the main asset, the unlimited liability of the partners to meet debts, was removed by an obliging Labour government. A successful action by Equitable Life against Ernst &amp; Young could close it down because Ernst &amp; Young may no longer have the assets to redress the claims of the victims of its alleged ineptitude.</p> <p>Needless to say, Patricia Hewitt's Department of Trade and Industry has been convinced and is all for going along with the Big Four's demands for lame duck accountants to be protected as an endangered species. </p> <p>But the rest of us may wonder that if claims for damages against accountancy firms can be capped, why shouldn't claims against any other business capped? Or claims against trade unions? Or hospitals? Or you? Or me? What incentive will there be for auditors to improve on their lamentable record if they receive fresh privileges? If they are hired by another Maxwell, why should they be any more concerned now about protecting pensioners from penury than they were in the 1980s?</p> <p>These columns normally end with a lament about the general worthlessness of New Labour's unprincipled ninnies. But for once there's a faint whiff of hope in the air. Last week the Office of Fair Trading said words to the effect that the Big Four should stop taking the mickey. Meanwhile institutional investors are lobbying against auditors being placed beyond the full reach of the law. According to rumour, they've been joined by Gordon Brown's Treasury. </p> <p>If the rumour is true, then delegates preparing for the Labour Party Conference should consider asking the Chancellor to overcome his notorious politeness and put Ms Hewitt in her place. The Labour Party wasn't founded to create a Milton Friedman world of socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor; where Mike Rake keeps his polo ponies while savers with Equitable Life lose their pensions.</p>",
  "<p>It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it. The places and spaces I've visited in search of stories for the interiors pages of this magazine include Valentino's yacht, which just happened to be moored off Capri for a few days in the middle of a trawl around the Mediterranean; the plush Manhattan pad of Sweetie, an A-list celebrity dog who kept his owner in dog biscuits by penning a column in a New York newspaper; and a Scottish eco-home made out of a whisky barrel. There have been houseboats, garden sheds, antique train carriages and a bender in the middle of a field in Wiltshire. People make their homes in the most unlikely places. And what is really extraordinary is not just where people set up home, but how they do it. They make it their mission to create the house beautiful, sourcing just the right tap, the exact shade of duck-egg blue, the ultimate bedside table. It is not so much the homes that are amazing as the time and energy and the tunnel vision many of us (you) have when it comes to decorating and (sometimes literally) building a nest. It really is inspiring. And although my own home is far from a show home (I just don't have the willpower or the DIY skills), I have to confess to stealing a few ideas from my own pages along the way. There was the plywood floor (thanks, Julie Verhoeven - I was tempted by your multicoloured vinyl tiles, too); the Moroccan tiles (mine are nothing compared to the acres that textile designer Hilde Smith had laid in her Shoreditch warehouse); and a bit of blackboard paint on the walls (an idea shared by Wayne Hemingway and Georgina Godley). So really, it's not me that's the expert, but the people I am lucky enough to meet. I'm just the nosy parker who gets to peep through the keyhole.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What planet do the people whose homes you feature live on? Where's the mess, the kids' toys, the clutter, the dishes in the sink, the clothes drying on the radiators? Where do these people get the time and energy to make such perfect show homes? And where do they get their money? <br><strong>Mrs V Talbot, north London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I want to see other people's clutter as much as you do, if only to make myself feel better about my own home. Admittedly, most people (though not all) run the hoover and a duster round their home before we photograph it. Wouldn't you? And it is not simply a matter of having lots of money and throwing it at the space. Sure, sometimes people's homes reflect their personal fortunes, and money can buy you a great space, the state-of-the-art kitchen and the furniture that most of us can only fantasise about. But the homes we feature are not about displays of wealth. They are about people who have a passion for their personal environment. Some people are just incredibly organised. An uncluttered home is all about storage, and if you have enough cupboards, shelves, boxes and hidy-holes, you will be amazed at how much mess you can cram out of sight. But just to make you feel better, I have to report that most of the homes we photograph have at least one room that is strictly off-limits. I can only imagine that behind those doors lies all the usual stuff that clutters up most of our lives.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Now that every property developer up and down the country is using stainless steel and laminate floors, what's next? If I want my home to look different and stand out from the rest, what should I put on the floor, and what are the cool alternatives to stainless steel in the kitchen?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> I think cork tiles are set to make a comeback. Cork producers are looking for other outlets now that winemakers are opting for plastic stoppers. And though you might think it is very Seventies retro, cork is a fantastic solution to your flooring needs. It is warm and soft underfoot, looks great varnished, and is very eco-friendly. Even our ethical expert Lucy Siegle would approve. Just don't combine it with an avocado bathroom suite. Other good options include stripped floors (I don't think a good set of stripped floorboards will ever go out of fashion), parquet (expensive, but always a joy), untreated oak (if the Tate Modern can leave their floors untreated, you can, too) and lots of rugs for colour and texture - look at the Rug Company for inspiration and then hunt the high street for affordable versions. For kitchen worktops, go for recycled plastic, and for splashbacks, how about old-fashioned tiles? There are hundreds to choose from and it is an easy way to inject a bit of colour and personality into your kitchen.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> How do you decorate a room to make couches that look a bit too big look as though they fit? We got our couches finally, and I know I'm just used to no furniture but they are very big! Eeek. Can't take 'em back now. They are super comfy and lovely, but they look weird. <br><strong>Rebecca Gill, Dublin</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You should really think about selling them on eBay and starting again. Or move home. There is nothing you can do about furniture that is too big for a room. Rule number one when buying a big piece of furniture is to mark out the space with newspaper before you buy. That way you can be sure how much space the item will take up and whether it fits or not. Never buy big pieces of furniture on impulse.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I live in a fairly small cottage and my children (a girl aged nine and a boy aged seven) have to share a bedroom. The trouble is that both are desperate to have their own room. However, because there's only one window, we can't divide the room. Can you suggest any ideas to make each feel they have their own space and yet not make the bedroom look like one crazy combination of a tweenie pop princess and premiership footballer?<br><strong> Anne Wilson</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I like the idea of mixing up tweenie pop princess and football fan. Might be an interesting experiment in gender development. But I imagine you're not interested in your children being guinea pigs, and they aren't interested in each other's obsessions, either. How about using a shelving system to divide the room? Ikea has a free-standing shelf unit on casters so you can move it around. They could divide the shelves between them so it might solve some storage problems, too. It should give them a bit of privacy without cutting the room in half. Or if there isn't enough space for shelves, you could divide the room with fairy lights. <a href=\"http://www.habitat.net\">Habitat</a> has some amazing decorative lights, including one called Mayfair which doubles as a very cool room divider. Another idea is to give them each their own self-contained den. Mail order company, <a href=\"http://www.wigwamkids.co.uk\">Wigwam</a> (0870 902 7500) has some great kids beds that double as dens. Which nine-year-old girl could resist Sophie's Fair, a fairy princess pink four-poster bed with curtains that can be drawn all the way around. It's pricey at \u00a3599, but you could always improvise with a bit of DIY woodwork. For your son, there's a raised bed with a curtained-off den area underneath (\u00a3399, plus \u00a385 for curtains). Kind of breaks the bank, but it should keep them happy. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a Victorian, scrubbed, pine-topped dining table, with heavy ornate dark 'oak' legs, 220cm by 106cm. I would like to buy four to six modern dining chairs which would provide that ultra-modern mixed with 'antique' look for my dining room. It is absolutely necessary that the chairs are comfortable as I envisage lengthy after-dinner lingering over coffee and lots of alcohol. I imagine something elegant, perhaps innovative in material and construction but within a price range that will not bring itself to the attention of my bank manager - I can go up to about \u00a3150 per chair. Are you able to suggest anything? <br><strong>Marion Lockerbie, Lancashire</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Your budget seems quite generous - you can afford something that will not only be stylish and comfortable, it will be a talking point for your dinner guests, too. The table sounds wonderful and I like the idea of mixing old and new. How about Philippe Starck's Louis Ghost Chair? It's made of see-through polycarbonate and is a typically witty, modern take on a traditional Louis XIV chair (\u00a3137 from <a href=\"http://www.purves.co.uk\">Purves &amp; Purves</a>). Or you could go for candy coloured Air chairs by <a href=\"http://www.scp.co.uk\">Jasper Morrison</a> - well within your budget at \u00a351 each and a true modern classic. Another option is the Eames DSR chair with its elegant wire work Eiffel base (slightly over budget at \u00a3155). This is eternally modern, and will look great with any table.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have just moved into a Georgian flat in Bristol and would like to decorate it in keeping with the period. Where can I go for inspiration? Can you give me any pointers? <br><strong>S Maddox</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> A great starting point would be a visit to the Geffrye Museum in east London. This is the museum of the British domestic interior, and is one of my favourite places to go for inspiration. It is set within a terrace of 18th-century almshouses (you can visit one of the restored almshouses on the first Saturday of each month) and the permanent exhibition takes the form of a series of room sets showing living rooms from 1600 to the present day. There are two Georgian rooms - early and late - showing the progression from an earlier elegant, pared-down style to a more ornate, classical style towards the end of the period. The great thing about the museum is the detail - each room has its contents listed in full, with dates, and sometimes where the object or piece of furniture came from. Then, if you want to find out more, there is a reading room with a good stock of books about British interiors, a shop with more books, and a changing exhibition featuring contemporary designers. At the moment you can see Flock'n'Roll, a survey of contemporary wallpaper. So you can get plenty of ideas for your home, both period and contemporary. The lovely garden room next to the reading room looks out to the walled gardens at the back, which are also well worth a visit. They reflect the chronology of the room sets, so you can see what a Georgian garden would have looked like, too. And, of course, there is a great cafe in the Nigel Coates designed extension, serving traditional British comfort food like bangers and mash and jam sponge and custard. <a href=\"http://www.geffrye-museum.org.uk\">Geffrye Museum</a>, Kingsland Road, London E2 (020 7739 9893).</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Is it really worth spending \u00a3600 on an office chair? I have a small home office and want a chair that will give me good support, but I don't have the budget of the Foreign Office. Can you recommend something that is ergonomic and under \u00a3200?<br><strong> Tom Pearmain, Norwich </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You are obviously referring to the Herman Miller Aeron chair. The Foreign Office recently bought 3,150 of them. I'm sure they got a good discount, but yes, the chairs do retail for around \u00a3600. You could buy a sofa for that. But the Aeron has achieved cult status. David Dimbleby uses one on Question Time. The arguably hipper Jon Snow of Channel Four News, however, sits on a classic Eames office chair. It's a Soft Pad in black leather, which will set you back a mere \u00a31,856. The Eames comes with a 30-year guarantee, but make sure you buy an authorised original made by Vitra. There's an Eames signature sewn into the upholstery at the back. Certainly puts the Aeron into perspective; I know which one I'd have if money were no object.</p> <p>But back to your question. If you are lucky, you can certainly pick up an Aeron second-hand for not too much more than your budget. Make sure you get the right size, though. If you are going to invest in such a finely tuned piece of engineering, it makes sense to get the one designed for your build and weight. Either that, or go for the top-of-the-range chair at Ikea. The Verksam swivel chair is \u00a3200 and is probably the best chair in terms of ergonomics for the money. But it doesn't look pretty and will never be offered a starring role on Newsnight. Jon Snow wouldn't even give it a second glance.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I recently stayed at the Standard Hotel in LA and really liked the way the curtains were printed with Andy Warhol images. I'd like to copy the idea in my bedroom. Is there anyone who can make customised printed curtains made to order? <br><strong>Philip</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hotel rooms can be a great source of inspiration. We all want the perfect hotel bathroom - limestone floors, Starck bath, etc, etc. Some hotels have even started to sell their bed linen and accessories (or they debit the money from your credit card if you steal them). But I'm not recommending you pack the curtains from your hotel room when you check out. Kate Osborn specialises in photo furnishings, combining art with interiors. You can give her any image and she will transform it into a print on anything from wallpaper to lampshades or blinds.

  "<p>Whenever I used to see Sebastian Coe in his role as a minor Conservative MP or, more recently, as the dark-suited chief-of-staff to William Hague, I thought of the character Tom Buchanan from The Great Gatsby . Buchanan is a former champion athlete who is described, by the novel's young narrator, as being 'one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at 21 that everything afterward savours of anticlimax'. </p> <p>Except that there was nothing limited about the sporting excellence of the young Sebastian Newbold Coe, even though much of his life since retiring from top-flight athletics must surely have savoured acutely of anticlimax. Coe was truly great - perhaps the greatest British athlete of the last century - and must have entered politics knowing that nothing he would ever do could recapture the intensity and grandeur of his sporting life; that the best of him, and long before his 40th birthday, was already in the past. </p> <p>'I won a marginal seat in 1992 and lost it in '97,' he tells me when we meet. 'In truth, I knew within 30 minutes of winning the seat that I would lose it again at the next election. Events were moving against us, and the arithmetic was unsustainable. Thirty six per cent of the vote in a three-way split was not something to base a career on. But I don't agree that my life since I retired from athletics has been an anticlimax. No, not at all. If I pull this off, for example - well, this would be huge.' </p> <p>He is referring to his role as chairman of the bid to bring the Olympic Games back to London in 2012. He was appointed following the surprise resignation in May of the previous incumbent, American entrepreneur Barbara Cassani. 'This is the greatest challenge I have ever faced,' Coe continues, with forgivable melodrama. 'This chance will not come round again in our lifetime, and we must do everything we can to win. Bringing the games to London would leave such a powerful legacy, in terms of the environment, in terms of urban renewal and in inspiring interest in sport among so many children and young people.' </p> <p>I am sitting with the good Baron Coe of Ranmore on a decrepit wooden bench at the British Airways Sailing Club in west London. Coe, who is tanned and wearing shorts, a white sports shirt and dark sunglasses, is waiting for Richard Branson and Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, to arrive so that they can climb into a canoe for a publicity stunt to promote the London bid. BA and Virgin Atlantic are sponsors of the bid. </p> <p>There is something remarkably boyish about Coe, who is 48 in September. He is lean, he moves quickly and his hair remains thick and dark. It is still easy to imagine him dressed in the white vest of Great Britain - and running very fast. 'I still sometimes run more than 40 miles a week,' he says. </p> <p>The bid to bring the games to London has been blighted by the obligatory infighting (the resignation of Cassani and its subsequent fallout), by the alleged corruption of the bidding process (BBC1's Panorama this week exposed how easily votes could be bought from members of the International Olympic Committee), and by prurience (Coe's appointment coincided with tabloid gossip about a mistress and 'late-night romps' in his car). </p> <p>All this had led me to expect that Coe would be anxious and harassed - an expectation reinforced when I received a call from his office, shortly before our interview, requesting that I ask him nothing about his private life. </p> <p>What do you mean by his private life? </p> <p>'You know,' the voice said. </p> <p>I said that no, I did not know. </p> <p>Then I discovered that a 'minder' from the London 2012 office had been assigned to sit in on our interview, as if to lead me not into temptation and the baron away from danger. But the minder, Fran Edwards, turns out to be very charming and Coe seems largely unconcerned by all the fuss. 'I've been around a long time,' he says, removing his sunglasses. 'I was selected for the national athletics team at the age of 18, I was an MP for five years, I worked closely with William Hague - I'm too long in the tooth to worry about what the press are saying about me.' </p> <p>He is perhaps being slightly disingenuous. After all, he unsuccessfully applied for an injunction to prevent his former lover, Vanessa Lander, from revealing the secrets of their affair in the Mail on Sunday in May - that, for instance, Coe paid for her to have an abortion while his wife, Nicola McIrvine, from whom he has since separated, was expecting their third child. 'Seb was very unhappy about this story coming out when it did,' one of his friends told me. 'He felt there was nothing of interest to the public in knowing about what had happened in the past.' </p> <p>The only problem with this explanation is that, at the time of his affair, Coe was a whip in a Conservative government led by a prime minister who, espousing a spurious puritan morality, was determined to 'get back to basics' but who turned out to be, like so many of his senior colleagues, an enthusiastic adulterer himself. The Conservatives remain stained by the scandal and corruption of the late Major years. Even Coe, who describes himself as necessarily 'politically neutral' in his present role, concedes that the party requires a 'new narrative'. 'Parties must understand,' he says, 'that it's not simply that people's aspirations change, but that the entire language of politics changes. When we were strong, the world was more certain. Politics was about the East-West divide and issues such as privatisation versus nationalisation. Now there are fewer certainties and per haps we, the Conservatives, have not fully understood that.' </p> <p>London is thought to be behind Paris, the favourite, and Madrid in the competition to stage the games. When the shortlist of five from which the winner will be chosen in July next year (the other contenders are New York and Moscow) was announced on 18 May, the IOC criticised many aspects of the London bid, notably the capital's shambolic transport infrastructure. 'But I don't think transport is a negative for us any longer,' Coe says. 'In fact, I think it can become a real positive. I'm not here to win arguments about under-investment, over-investment or sideways investment in transport. What I am here to do is to provide a transport plan. Can I do that? Yes. Can I get 240 trains on 10 lines going into Stratford in 2012? Yes, I can. Can I get them in from Kings Cross in seven minutes on 15 shuttles an hour? Yes, I can. With the East London line in place, can I get them from Trafalgar Square into the heart of the Olympic complex in 15 minutes? Yes, I can. And I know that in eight years I can offer the best transport plan that has ever been put forward in an Olympic Games.' Well, it's useful, as Philip Larkin once wrote, to get that learnt. </p> <p>Coe speaks with the smoothness and ease of the career politician. He is evasive when necessary, such as when I ask him why exactly Barbara Cassani resigned (friends of Cassani told me that she believed that London could not win, that she was disappointed by the lack of support from the government and that she disliked the forced affability of the Olympic circuit and the sycophancy that is necessary in the race to win votes), and has instant recollection of all the right statistics and supporting detail. He is effusive about the support of Ken Livingstone, and circumspect when discussing Tony Blair's reported diminished enthusiasm for the London bid. 'The perception may be that the Prime Minister isn't behind us, but I know that he is absolutely committed. How do I know this? I've had private conversations with him.' </p> <p>Coe is most animated when I ask him about the glorious summer of 1979 when, over a period of 41 days, he broke the 800m, the 1500m and the mile world records - the first athlete to hold all three records at the same time - and about fellow middle-distance runner Steve Ovett. His rivalry with Ovett, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, enthralled, enchanted and infuriated in about equal measure. It enchanted because they were so good; it infuriated because they refused to race each other outside international championships. </p> <p>They could not have been more different: Coe was the intense, articulate graduate from Sheffield, coached by his father, Peter, and a model of middle class rectitude and stubborn determination. Ovett, from Brighton, was something of a free spirit, as audaciously talented as Coe but more naturally rebellious, which meant he was always more popular than Coe, perhaps because he appeared to care less. Together they redefined the art of the possible in middle-distance running, exuberantly winning Olympic gold medals, recklessly breaking world records. British sport had never seen anything like them, and never has since. </p> <p>Today, Ovett lives in affluent seclusion in Australia while Coe remains a very public figure and quintessential establishment insider: politician, bureaucrat, ambassador, diplomat. It is fascinating to hear him speak about his great rivalry with Ovett because his recollection of it all is so startlingly fresh, as if he never ceases thinking about it. 'I don't think people ever appreciated how talented Ovett was,' he says, with wonder his voice. 'I'm not sure even Steve fully understood. Here was a guy who could win a national cross-country championship but also hold the English schools title at 200m. A week before he won the 1500m World Cup in 1977, one of the greatest runs at the distance of all time, he got bored and ran the Dartford half-marathon. He had phenomenal range, probably more than me. The only problem was he lacked confidence in his ability. I'm sure he could have run even faster, a lot faster, if he'd had more confidence.' </p> <p>In 1988, Coe, age withering him, was left out of the British team for the Seoul Olympics, thus being deprived of a chance to win his third gold medal at consecutive Games (he won gold in the 1500m at Moscow, in 1980, and at Los Angeles, in 1984). 'I would have won, I would have won,' he says now of the 1500m final in Seoul, then gently raps his fist on the table. 'You know, when I was left out, I was offered the chance to run for any number of other countries, including India, because one of my grandparents was Indian. But I couldn't really do that, I couldn't...' </p> <p>There is doubt in his voice and you know that he knows that he should have accepted the offer to run for gold in Seoul, even if it meant draping himself in an Indian flag. </p> <p>The Athens Olympics begin on 13 August. Yet never in recent memory has a British athletics team set off for an Olympics with such low-toned expectations, nor had so few individuals of national renown. Our champion sprinter Dwain Chambers is banned for taking the steroid THG, and the era of our dominance of middle-distance running is long gone. 'I think track and field has a real problem because it's such a tough sport to sell,' Coe says. 'We live in an odd culture now where you can go on Big Brother and become a household name. All this makes it that much harder for a coach to turn to a 14-year-old and say, \"We think you're very talented and if you stick at this, keep working hard, you might, by the time you're 21, be making a few ripples on the pond.\" Too many people want everything now and aren't prepared to work. But the fundamentals of athletics - being able to run fast, jump and throw - are the fundamentals of all other sports. Master these and you have a chance at everything else.' </p> <p>So can Coe bring the Olympics to London? If he does succeed, and the odds are against him, it would surely redeem all the disappointments of the recent past - the failure of his political career and the humiliating defeat of William Hague at the last election - and enable him once more to experience the adulation of victory. 'To bring the Olympics to London would be much bigger than anything I achieved before. Winning an Olympic gold impacts upon yourself and your friends and family and, for a short time, your chosen sport. But this would impact upon the whole nation. It would be monumental, stratospheric.' </p> <p>With that, he leaps up to shake the hand of a departing Richard Branson. He'll have many more hands to shake before discovering whether he has won the longest and greatest race of his life.</p>",
  "<p>Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes pinches my tape recorder and turns it towards Manuel Almunia, the Spanish goalkeeper. Putting on his interviewer's voice, he asks Arsenal's new signing: 'So, Almunia, to start with, how have your first days at the club been?' Before Reyes sits down to answer a single question, one thing is clear: he is part of the Arsenal family.</p> <p>Seven months after signing from Seville, Reyes is comfortable with his surroundings. He recognises his role in the side, feels the club is his, and is comfortable with expectations and demands. In the absence of Lauren, the adopted dad of the growing Brazilian-Spanish community at Highbury who was back in London to spend time with his first baby, Reyes moves around with the authority and confidence he used to have at Sevilla. Very impressive for a 20-year-old. </p> <p>It takes a while to seat him as he casts an eye in every direction, taking in everything going on around the lounge of the Amsterdam Hilton, including the chat Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson is having with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. It takes even longer for him to concentrate on the questions.</p> <p>'You're not going to take long, are you, you *******?' he asks, adding a few post-nine-o'clock-watershed Spanish words. In the friendliest possible way. </p> <p>The first questions are inevitable: how will Arsenal look without Patrick Vieira, and how have the squad lived through the soap opera of the summer? </p> <p>'Patrick has not hidden at all. He has faced the music from the beginning, although he has not talked much about it to anybody and did not train. The players have been trying to guess about his future and we know it will be almost impossible to beat a Real Madrid with him. He eats with me at the same table and I wind him up, \"You are going to Madrid\", and he laughs all the time. He is a man you can speak to anytime, he is so affable. To lose someone like him is a huge blow, but when Madrid want something, they tend to get it.'</p> <p> Reyes soon switches to automatic and answers questions with almost the same words he used in previous interviews. He speaks in an unusual accent: the Spanish equivalent of a Scouser trying to sound like a BBC presenter. In short sentences, delivered at high speed, he finds enough confidence to face the part of his profession he likes least - explaining himself. </p> <p>'Each coach has his way of doing things, but training is very similar here and Spain. Surprisingly, the biggest difference is that at Arsenal we use more ball than in Spain. Everything is done with a football and that for a player is very important.</p> <p>'Joaquin Caparros, my coach at Sevilla, used to speak to us much more, but Wenger is one of those that says little and lets people do the talking on the pitch. There are fewer technical talks, which is great. And the strikers do not have as many defensive obligations as at Sevilla, where we had to go back to our own box sometimes. Wenger prefers us to stay in the opposite half constantly. And that is it. When we are not training, it is the same - we can do whatever we please.'</p> <p> And what would that be? In Seville, the city with the biggest percentage of bars and season-ticket holders per square metre in the world, he was the hero and villain at the same time. Adored by Sevilla fans, he would be stopped and hassled by rival Betis supporters, so Reyes preferred to spend most of his time at the family home. The house was much bigger than the one he lived in when he was found by Sevilla as a teenager - minimal utilities and water dripping from the roof on the rare days when it rained. His new Seville address is easily recognisable by the huge drawings of his face on one of the walls, along with his old club badge. Someone added an Arsenal one recently.</p> <p>There are no plans to decorate his new Bedfordshire residence the same way. His mother, father and girlfriend will still live with him for now and those who know him well are aware it could not be any other way. 'I go shopping with my family, we spend time discovering the city. I have been here for six months and I am still learning about my surroundings.'</p> <p>The new house will be 'more Andalucia than England. We have brought hardly anything from home, but the things we got in England look very Spanish. I used to buy cars, I love cars, but now I prefer to collect properties. It is better to buy houses to have something for the future.' So, finally his mother, the biggest influence in his life, has succeeded in making him realise that the cars, on which he spent his first millions, were just the fulfilment of a teenager's dream. </p> <p>The rest of the time, he takes his English lessons and plays football on his PlayStation, sometimes until midnight. It has been known for friends to beg him to let them go home. 'You must come soon, I am going to beat you,' he threatens. He mostly watches Spanish television but also likes English music and sport channels.</p> <p>'I don't buy newspapers, I have a look at the ones players bring to training, as well as magazines on cars, games and computers that fly around in the changing room. Harrods is my favourite shop.'</p> <p>After the teen-magazine questions, he rests back and becomes the 20-year-old Jos\u00e9 Antonio again, and the reality of his uneasy settling in London comes out.</p> <p>'The first few months were awful. I wanted to go home, I was ill because of it. Many people couldn't understand why I left Seville and would tell me how difficult it was going to be to adapt. At first I thought they were right, that I couldn't cope. It has changed now, thank God. I feel protected by the club. Having the family around has helped enormously. Once you are used to it, you can live anywhere,' he says, almost convincingly. </p> <p>'If you are from the south, even when another club doubles or quadruples your wages, you think about moving a million times. Six or seven players at Arsenal speak Spanish and that has been very useful. But I cannot help but miss the rest of my family - my brother who just got married and especially my grandad. I would love to have him with me, but he has heart troubles and I am scared that the trip will kill him. </p> <p>'I go to Seville when they give us free days but in the pre-season we are not getting so many.' And, when in Seville, once he has visited his family, he goes to see the other love of his life, the Virgin of Consolation. 'I am a big devotee of Our Lady. I have her everywhere, at home, in London. I pray to her practically every day. I don't ask her anything, I have it all, thank God, so I thank her for her help and support. She has been very kind to me.'</p> <p>His former club still take some of his time. 'I follow Sevilla by internet and watching Sky. The club have given me everything and I have to know what is going on with them. They helped me as a player but also as a person. If it wasn't for Sevilla I wouldn't be here.'</p> <p>But, as Rafa Benitez admits when he talks about Liverpool, Reyes soon realised he was making a jump in quality when he was shown the facilities at Arsenal. 'You see it immediately - the training pitches, the changing rooms, new grass every year, the feet don't hurt after training.' Reyes, a clear case of natural raw talent, is also pleasantly surprised by the approach of Wenger. 'He doesn't talk a lot but he feels close. He uses a bit of English and a bit of Spanish. He tells me before a match where I play. During the pre-season he has placed me wide left and second forward and in both positions I have been scoring, I feel good. After that, he knows what we all can offer and doesn't tell me what to do.</p> <p>'It is stupid to tell a player where he has to run and when - the match decides what you have to do. Anyway, as long as I am in the line-up I don't mind where I play.' </p> <p>Reyes has never hidden that he prefers to play behind the striker, but Wenger is not worried about his position or in general about moulding his instinct.</p> <p>'If you tell a player like him what to do,' Wenger says, 'you kill his creativity. The only thing is that it is too risky to let him go too deep, he can lose the ball and find us out of shape. You can see his game has settled after the first months and he looks quicker and stronger since he came back from holidays. His mobility is his main skill and we can definitely use that to our advantage.' </p> <p>Reyes was not aware he was born for English football until he arrived at Highbury. 'I prefer English football to Spanish. In Spain, the competition is called ' La Liga of the stars' and people talk of players as Galacticos , but it has less pace, less rhythm, it breaks up too often. I love it here, with the constant box-to-box action and even the fair play - nobody demands cards for others.' Using his skills in a different environment has helped Reyes realise how far he has come and how much he still has to learn.</p> <p>'[Thierry] Henry is, along with Lauren, one of my best friends in the squad. He speaks a bit of Spanish too and I speak a bit of English. I spend lots of time with him and with Vieira. It is fantastic to be so close to Henry, I look at him and learn movements, technical gestures, and attitude. I don't think by a long way we have seen the best of me. I tend to watch carefully Thierry and van Nistelrooy. All forwards have something to learn from those two.'</p> <p>In the streets of Seville, diehard fans of his old club still talk of what has become an urban myth - the story of Villega, a player the same age as Reyes, but who was even better when they started together. Villega went down the wrong path. 'He was 12 or 13 and was chosen best European player or something like that, he was a fantastic footballer. But the stupid things, too many nights out, too many drinks took him the wrong way. That is why it is important you have the family around and also the will to be someone.' </p> <p>Reyes became someone in England against Chelsea last season, when he scored two goals and set the standards he has since imposed on himself.</p> <p>'I will never forget it because I felt nobody knew much about me and it was a way of introducing myself. Now we have to win the league again, it should be the priority, and keep growing after that. We will have another go at the Champions League, although I have no idea why we cannot do better in Europe. </p> <p>'You know, since we met up after the holidays, we haven't talked about Chelsea or Manchester United at all. We are only interested in ourselves. The best thing in this team is that nobody feels superior, nobody is arrogant, nobody acts as the boss, but also we have a feeling of working for the same cause.' </p> <p>If the Chelsea fixture was the high since his arrival at Highbury, the low was the strange decision of the Spanish national coach, I\u00f1aki Saez, to choose a centre-back (Juanito) instead of Reyes for Euro 2004. The new man in charge, Luis Aragones, is willing to fight the misconception that if you are Spanish and play abroad it is possibly because you are not good enough.</p> <p>'I hope it is better with him. I really got very upset, I didn't understand why I didn't go to Portugal.' The good news is that Aragones has already said, off the record, that he will have Reyes in his first line-up for the friendly against Venezuela next week. </p> <p>Almost three quarters of an hour answering questions about himself is something Reyes would prefer not to have done, but there is one more before he goes to joke with team-mates Cesc Fabregas and Almunia. If he could bring only one thing from Spain, what would that be?</p> <p>'My grandad,' he says, barely making an effort to hide the melancholy that will accompany his English adventure.</p>",
  "<p>Members of BAR-Honda will find themselves on the horns of an unpleasant dilemma next weekend when they prepare for the thirteenth round of the championship in Hungary. On the one hand, they will want Jenson Button to make the most of this opportunity to win his and the team's first grand prix and consolidate third place - and possibly challenge for second - in both the drivers' and constructors' championships. On the other, one or two mechanics might be excused for wishing to wrap a hefty spanner around the Englishman's head. </p> <p>This is the first time Button will come face to face with the BAR workforce since causing hurt and outrage by choosing suddenly to announce his intention to join Williams-BMW in 2005 because he reckons he has a far better chance of winning the championship with his former employers. Button and his management team approached Williams when they felt BAR had not fulfilled a contractual option. After consulting their lawyers, Williams agreed Button was indeed free to rejoin the team that gave him his first F1 drive in 2000. </p> <p>Williams dropped Button at the end of a largely indifferent first season in favour of Juan Pablo Montoya, Button then spending two fruitless years with Renault before switching to BAR. It was here that he began to flourish and mature into a driver capable of taking his first pole position, finishing second three times and third on four occasions this year; a transformation encouraged by a happy and productive working environment that has now been torn apart, not only by Button's peremptory decision, but also by his rather weak insistence on refusing to communicate with BAR. </p> <p>It is every driver's right to pursue the best drive available but Button seemed less than convincing when giving his only interview so far to BBC Radio 5 Live on Friday night. 'I am going to be driving for BMW-Williams next year,' said Button. 'My main aim is to be world champion and I want to be able to challenge Michael Schumacher for the championship in the next few years. To do that, I think Williams is the best team.' </p> <p>Quite why Button should suddenly become hell bent on getting out is difficult to understand since it remains to be seen whether the move to Williams is the right one. Williams are in the middle of a lengthy trough of uncompetitiveness summed up by the former champions being fourth in the table with 47 points, 29 behind BAR, the only team along with Ferrari to have scored points in the 12 races held so far. Williams will recover; the question is when. </p> <p>It is easy to assume that money is the motivating force but, given Sir Frank Williams's renowned parsimony - particularly after paying Ralf Schumacher handsomely for little return - that is unlikely to be the case. Button is known to have had talks with Williams some time ago but the largely informal discussion foundered immediately on an offer of between $2.5 million and $3m, a figure that fell short of the estimated $7m Button is receiving from BAR. Certainly, the figure of $10m, mentioned by one newspaper, is far in excess of whatever has been agreed with Williams, and the sum may even be less than he is earning now. All of which adds to the mystery. </p> <p>If Button's seemingly desperate need to leave is genuine, then everyone, including David Richards, the boss of BAR, failed to notice it in advance. More important, however, is the fact that Richards inadvertently, or perhaps carelessly, gave Button the excuse he was looking for by failing to resolve a contractual problem - believed to have been minor in essence but long-running. He assumed that Button would stay, almost as a matter of course. Richards may have had first call on Button's services until 31 July but he appears to have ignored the contractual links Button maintains with Williams and which do not expire until the end of next year. </p> <p>Given the largely second-rate list of drivers in the frame to be team-mate to Mark Webber (who joins from Jaguar), Williams naturally jumped at the chance to sign a man who has become arguably one of the top three drivers in the world. If having the best British driver on board will greatly assist Williams's championship campaign and sponsorship quest then, conversely, his absence from BAR will have a devastating effect; another reason for BAR and Honda's state of bewilderment quickly turning to anger and resentment. </p> <p>'The resources at BMW-Williams are fantastic,' said Button. 'They are a team that will win the championship next year.' </p> <p>That is a brave prediction in the long term. More immediately, such a slap in the face for the resurgent BAR team will have doubled their determination to win in Hungary. The weather in Budapest promises to be the usual mix of searing heat and humidity but not even the high ambient temperature is likely to thaw the icy climate within the garage at BAR-Honda after a piece of badly managed PR that would not have been out of place within the headquarters of the FA. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p><strong> The Adventure of English<br> by Melvyn Bragg </strong><br>Sceptre \u00a38.99, pp 354 </p> <p> 'A language is a dialect with an army and navy.' This well-worn saw of sociolinguistics underlies Melvyn Bragg's The Adventure of English, which he originally intended to entitle The Triumph of English, before being told this was too, well, triumphant. Instead, we are given an entertaining biography of our famous mother tongue, from her 5th-century inception, to present-day status as weapon of choice for 85 per cent of websites. Unlike many celebrity biogs, the early years of relative obscurity are the most fascinating; the glory years of Shakespeare, in contrast, are really both too large and too well known a subject to be comprehensively investigated in a single chapter. It is the unlikely survival of English speech during the Norman Conquest that really makes the case for its celebrated egalitarian roots, lingering as it did outside the French-speaking court, in the homes of supposedly ill-spoken peasants. This balances the more traditional emphasis on how English conquered the globe when Britannia ruled the waves, and the dialect with the army and navy finally became a confirmed global language through its empire. </p> <p>This is a highly readable, jargon-free treatise on a notoriously prickly subject, intended for general readers rather than academics. It seems unfair to criticise Bragg for his very occasional lapses of thoroughness: he is a self-confessed amateur. Amateur, as any self-respecting etymologist will tell you, derives from the French for love, and Bragg's affection for his subject is infectious. In this he successfully joins a long tradition of gentlemen enthusiasts, from peppery Dr Johnson to genial James Murray, who spent five years writing A up to ant in the first Oxford English Dictionary. Thank goodness such ponderous attention to detail is not the purpose of Bragg's entertaining, anecdotal history.</p>",
  "Government help with emergency childcare for working mothers might benefit big business (News, last week) but only at the expense of parents, who will feel pressured by this 'service' to give work more priority over their children than feels comfortable. It will also be at the expense of children, for whom quality care starts with familiarity. <p>The ideal emergency care-giver is one or other parent, perhaps drawing on parental leave as in Sweden, or a relative or friend. Would the small child currently resident in Downing Street ever be left with strangers? </p> <p>Instead of encouraging what sounds like a baby sitting service, government should invest more in the childcare options already proven to work for adults and children, and support firms in offering flexible working not only to parents but to all who have caring responsibilities.<br> <b>Penelope Leach</b><br> <b>Gill Haynes OBE</b><br> Chairman and chief executive, National Childminding Association<br> Bromley<br> Kent </p> <p>For most working women with children in childcare, the scheme for emergency childcare that you report is nothing more than a 'nice idea' created by people who know how to make the government appear sympathetic to working women but who are not in touch with their day-to-day lives. </p> <p>I am a mother of two pre-school children, I work for the NHS as a hospital doctor and I know the consequences of unexpected leave due to illness of a child. My first priority is to my children and if Tony Blair thinks I will leave them with a complete stranger when they are ill then he is wrong.

  "<p>Hollywood has always been an acutely political place but with rare exceptions it has generally shied away from projecting its allegiances on to the screen. But with politics as the single most energising - and polarising - subject in a presidential election year, the film business is no longer so squeamish about divisive material. </p> <p>In the wake of Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore's polemical anti-Bush documentary that has taken more than $100 million at the box office, making it the most successful documentary of all time, the business is preparing to release more films with overt political messages than at any time since the collapse of the Nixon administration. </p> <p>At the very least, says Bob Thomson, media studies professor at Syracuse University, Hollywood is less afraid than it was immediately after 11 September: 'People were wondering if anyone would ever tell a joke about the President again, or if there would ever be another explosion in the movies.' </p> <p>Last week Paramount Pictures released director Jonathan Demme's remake of a 1962 classic of paranoia and global misgivings, The Manchurian Candidate. With a sinister multinational conglomerate in place of the original's communist power, and Denzel Washington standing in for Frank Sinatra, the $80m film took $20m in its first three days. </p> <p>While it is not overtly partisan, it is hard not to view it through the lens of current events. </p> <p>It is a very, very angry movie, says producer Scott Rudin, identifying the central emotion of the electoral season. The film-makers acknowledge that the global corporation at the centre of the plot is a virtual stand-in for Halliburton, and Republicans who have seen the film tend to view the candidate - a decorated war hero from a good family - as a stand-in for Senator Kerry. </p> <p>With the nation so bitterly divided in the run-up to the November election, Paramount studio head Sherry Lansing says the film is a Rorschach test. 'With the nation's eye focused on a presidential election this year, I couldn't think of a better time to address darker themes about the political process and the forces that try to undermine it,' says Demme. </p> <p>According to Thomson, the political allusions are less significant than Hollywood's realisation that national politics can make for successful programming. 'Like The West Wing, The Manchurian candidate is cashing in on the fact that the news cycle has turned national politics into a rich mine of entertainment,' he says. But he cautions that political entertainment should not be read as necessarily political. 'Regardless of the politics of the executive or the star, the one thing they want to do is to make everybody lots of money. It's still showbusiness.' </p> <p>Not all the politically oriented films out between now and November are drenched in paranoia. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, makers of South Park, are soon to release their own look at runaway US imperialism, Team America: World Police . With the tagline 'Putting the \"F\" back in freedom', and a plot described as 'Superheroes fight to end terrorism and put tired celebrities out of their misery', the film's satire is likely to be as offensive as South Park. </p> <p>Film-makers look back to the last time Hollywood had its finger on a political pulse - to the mid-Seventies and films like Chinatown, The conversation and All the president's Men. 'People felt galvanised then just as we do now - it galvanises you to be living through a nightmare,' says producer John Calley, who was head of Warner Bros when the studio released All the President's Men. </p> <p>'There was a terrible sense of discontent about our society, though I have to say that Watergate was nothing compared with what we have now.' </p> <p>Emerging from a long period in which Hollywood has produced little more than comic-book fantasies and teen comedies, films with social and political import are finally fashionable again. And not all of them are sub tle. Next month, John Sayles releases Silver City, a thriller about an Enron-style energy company that selects a born-again son of a powerful senator to run for high public office with the backing of the oil industry. </p> <p>She Hate Me, Spike Lee's take on our current condition, is about a corporate whistleblower who supports himself by being a sperm donor for lesbian couples. 'Most mass entertainment is an opiate - it puts you in a stupor,' Lee told the Los Angeles Times. 'When I look at great films like On the waterfront, A Face in the Crowd or The Battle of Algiers, those are movies about people trying to make something happen. They make you want to do something when you get out of the theatre.' </p> <p>Exactly what, Lee does not say, but there's no shortage of stimulation and all of it - with the exception of Walt Disney Pictures' patriotic America's Heart and Soul - anti-Bush or anti all those perceived to do the administration's bidding. </p> <p>Already out or soon forthcoming are the documentaries Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism, The Hunting of the President, Uncovered: the Whole Truth about the Iraq War, Bush's Brain, profiling Bush's political mastermind Karl Rove, and Persons of Interest, a provocative look at the detention of Arab and Muslim immigrants in the US. And coming this autumn are two pro-John Kerry documentaries, Inside the Bubble and Tour of Duty. </p> <p>According to Thomson, the political documentary has the potential to be for the left what talk radio is for the right. 'The left has finally found a medium,' he says. </p> <p>Of the entertainment industry's most famous political sons, Ronald Reagan was Republican, as is Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Hollywood is unlikely to let up with the anti-Bush drumbeat between now and November. With the sense that the administration is weak, those that might otherwise keep their affiliations to themselves are becoming vocal. Last week, Bruce Springsteen announced he would take part in a 'Vote for change' tour that sets off in early October. </p> <p>'Our goal is to change the direction of the government and change the current administration come November,' he said, and accused Bush of undertaking an 'unnecessary war in Iraq', running record budget deficits, cutting spending on social programmes and giving tax cuts to the richest Americans - himself included. </p> <p>Anger and paranoia is only so entertaining, and Hollywood is getting set to indulge the romantic idealism of the revolutionary again with at least three films completed or in production about Che Guevara. </p> <p>Still, as Joel Achenbach of the Washington Post pointed out last week, paranoia, a permanent element of American politics, is adaptive. 'The question you have to ask yourself is: Who am I worried about now? If it weren't for fear, loathing, paranoia and anxiety, the American electorate would have almost no feelings whatsoever,' he wrote. </p> <p>How long the entertainment industry can remain so politicised is an open question. Thomson predicts that the success of Fahrenheit 9/11 will ensure that the political documentary is here to stay. 'The fact that it can bring in $100m and people are going to see it by choice is tempting to so many people who'd love to get overt ideological stuff out and have people pay for it. My guess is that this is just the beginning.'</p>",
  "<p>KKR, the giant American private equity group, is considering entering the \u00a3700 million bid battle for American advertising group Grey Global, according to City sources. </p> <p>Ed Meyer, Grey Global's 77-year-old founder and controlling shareholder, has appointed Goldman Sachs to sell the company, the last of the large global advertising groups to remain independent. Meyer stands to make \u00a319m from the sale. </p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP had been considered favourite to land Grey after French rival Publicis ruled itself out of the bidding. But it is now facing competition as rival suitors begin to emerge. </p> <p>French rival Havas has joined forces with US venture capital firm Quadrangle and another American financial buyer, Hellman &amp; Friedman, is also in the running. There is speculation that KKR may team up with Hellman to mount a joint bid. </p> <p>KKR is best known for mounting the largest ever private equity buyout, paying \u00a317bn for RJR Nabisco. The deal made its founder, Henry Kravis, a Wall Street legend. </p> <p>WPP's shares have fallen nearly 10 per cent in the past month over fears that it might overpay for Grey - regarded as a huge prize not least because it counts Procter &amp; Gamble among its clients. </p> <p>WPP handles the advertising for P&amp;G's fierce rival, Unilever, but it has told Sorrell that it would not object if WPP bought Grey. </p> <p>Prospective buyers are now conducting due diligence and initial bids are expected to be tabled within weeks, though sources close to the sale say the timetable has slipped. Analysts value Grey at about $1.5bn.</p>",
  "<p>The British pay for beer, not for television. That was the argument levelled against Rupert Murdoch in 1988 when he began talking about launching a subscription-based satellite TV service. So said countless bigwigs in the television establishment of the day, not to mention assorted MPs and industry pundits. </p> <p>Last week BSkyB, where Rupert is chairman and his son James is chief executive, delivered taxable profits of nearly \u00a3500 million, reinstated the dividend, and said that excess capital would be returned to investors through share buybacks. The firm now has more than 7 million subscribers and commands about 70 per cent of the pay-TV market. And yet this was the company that did not understand how television in Britain worked. </p> <p>But just as the lemmings of the television world lined up 16 years ago to pour cold water on Murdoch's enterprise, so the lemmings of the City last week decried the company's decision to invest heavily in the business to proceed to the next phase of growth. </p> <p>The 20 per cent fall in BSkyB's share price was to be expected given that the \u00a3450m investment and \u00a380m marketing spend was much higher than forecast and will reduce earnings growth for a few years. So analysts' spreadsheets have to be reworked. </p> <p>But the criticism of BSkyB and James Murdoch is regrettable, and it shows once again that the City is more interested in short-term profits than investing in British commerce. </p> <p>No doubt, Murdoch could have courted popularity by giving back millions more to shareholders via even higher dividends. But then consider the reaction a year from now if the business had stalled badly because BSkyB had failed to invest adequately in marketing and advertising, or had fallen behind by not upgrading its data management operations, studios and call centres. </p> <p>We all know there would be howls of protest from those same shareholders who, last week, complained so bitterly that the company was risking yet more of their capital for an uncertain return. Need I say more?</p> <p><strong>... and why weren't we told, wail shareholders</strong></p> <p>The drubbing that BSkyB received at the hands of its shareholders last week highlights an entirely different issue, but a no less important one. Has anyone paused to think whether it was necessary for Murdoch's big spending scheme to come as such a surprise to investors? </p> <p>In the old days, companies would use smoke signals to warn brokers that forecasts needed revising. But the new regulatory environment built around the Financial Services Authority means that senior executives can hardly tell us what they had for dinner without calling in the lawyers to make certain that they are not breaking one of the many new rules designed to create 'an orderly market'. </p> <p>But making companies so scared of saying anything ahead of announcing results makes the market more dysfunctional than ever. Regulations designed to protect private and institutional investors are having the opposite effect as shareholders risk waking up to discover that the value of their shares has slumped by 20 per cent, as happened with BSkyB. </p> <p>In short, the rules are not working. At the very least, they need to be interpreted far less strictly, or binned altogether. </p> <p><strong>Lloyds and Barclays are in the predators' sights</strong></p> <p>The battle for Abbey National is hotting up as RBS and HSBC prepare to enter the fray as soon as HBOS fires off a bid in September. Then there will be a Competition Commission inquiry and we will have to wait many months for the outcome. At the end of it, Spanish bank Santander's offer may be the only show in town, if the regulator blocks a bid from a UK player - though HBOS may yet scrape through. </p> <p>But what is beginning to emerge is that the shake-up will not end with the demise of Abbey. Just as Britain's investment banks were taken over by mostly US and European institutions in the 1980s and 1990s, so the bell tolls for our high-street banks. Barclays and Lloyds are in the sights of US predators as the sector is ripe for international consolidation. </p> <p>Whoever swallows Abbey will be a major force on the British high street. But I doubt that Lloyds and Barclays will be the purchasers. Sir John Bond's HSBC and Fred Goodwin's Royal Bank of Scotland are already international powerhouses, and James Crosby's HBOS - while lacking overseas clout - has become a huge player in Britain since it took over Bank of Scotland in 2001. They have left behind Lloyds and Barclays, especially Lloyds, which is a shadow of its former self. But both are now vulnerable to a takeover by the likes of Citigroup or Bank of America. It is only a matter of time.</p> <p><strong>Virgin territory</strong></p> <p>I was intrigued to hear that Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is ordering as many as 26 Airbus planes, which would more than double his fleet in a few years. Some portray the move as a major onslaught against BA, which should have the dominant airline quaking in its boots. Er, I don't think so. </p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is a minnow compared to BA, which has about 300 planes against Virgin's current tally of 29. Moreover, BA's fortunes will be given a considerable boost when it takes on its new hub at Heathrow's terminal 5. The opening of the terminal will mean that for the first time BA will have all its long and short-haul aircraft under one roof, making it easier for BA passengers to transfer and bringing in extra business as a result. True, Virgin is a thorn in BA's side, but the flag carrier's bigger competitors are the American airlines, Air France and Lufthansa. </p> <p>All this is not to dismiss Virgin, which has forced BA to sharpen its act and improve its service on every route where the two airlines compete. Nor should I make light of the fact that Virgin will soon compete with BA on routes it has previously had to itself - London to Australia, for example. That has to be good for customer choice. </p> <p>But none of this will have Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, waking up in the night in a cold sweat. The high oil price and threat of industrial action across BA's operations are more serious issues for Eddington. Enough said.</p>",
  "<p>Arsenal could make as much as \u00a35 million a year from a big company having its name and logo on their \u00a3465m new ground. </p> <p>The Premiership champions' global popularity means they could strike the most lucrative stadium naming deal in football history, believe sports sponsorship experts Sport + Markt. </p> <p>Arsenal have already held initial discussions with high-profile companies - from the drinks, travel, finance and electronics industries - through Envision, the American specialists they have hired to find a buyer.

  "<p>Even a hangover can't dim the enchantment of Luang Prabang. The gauzy tranquillity of the place puts a languid drift into your step and a diaphanous cloak of dreamy carelessness descends upon you. The river reflects the gilded curlicues of the temples and the crumbling colonnades of antique French villas. Lush palms line the riverbank and the wooden balustrades of the Lao houses are twined with scarlet bougainvillaea. </p> <p>For nearly three decades, communism kept Laos and Luang Prabang in a timewarp. The unique Lao-French architecture and ancient temples miraculously survived battles, bombs and bureaucracy but were in a sad state of decay when the bamboo curtain finally clattered down and glasnost came to this little-known one-party state. </p> <p>I had come to Luang Prabang for the food. If Laos had managed to keep its distinctive identity intact outside the homogeneous blanket of globalisation, then surely its cuisine had too. </p> <p>I was staying at the Vanvisa Guesthouse, a small place owned by Madame Vandara, an entrepreneurial communist who is celebrated for her Lao cookery lessons. Like many Laotians who remained after the revolution, Vandara still proudly believed in the village-socialism of her youth - though now with room for a little profit on the side. </p> <p>The evening I arrived, Vandara was out of town, so I unwisely spent my first night at her guesthouse testing the local liquor, lao lao, a homemade rice spirit of unspecific gravity. I awoke with a monstrous hangover. Dying of thirst, I staggered downstairs in search of water and lurched straight into Vandara, her family and their guests sitting formally at breakfast. They looked at me with horrified expressions. I froze. Then we all burst into laughter. </p> <p>Vandara and I took an immediate liking to one another. We talked food all morning. Warming to my enthusiasm, she suggested we went to market the next morning and then cook a meal together. </p> <p> Lao lao lesson learnt, I awoke sober the following morning, dressed quickly and walked out into the dawn half light. I dipped into the back streets towards the market and found myself in an elegant residential district of winding lanes, coconut groves and duck ponds. I was right in the middle of town but it felt like a village. Dilapidated French stucco villas stood beside Lao-French country houses and traditional bamboo homes in an appealing muddle; Unesco was just in time to save the old buildings when it made Luang Prabang a World Heritage Site in 1991. </p> <p>As the darkness lifted, I could see people coming from the hills around with bundles on their heads. A Tannoy started up, with tinny music intermingled with the morning news. The market was soon buzzing; it was huge - a pungent, steaming, seething mass. </p> <p>Women arrived, unfolded a bit of sacking on a trestle table and spread out their goods in symmetrical piles arranged to arrest you in mid-stride: tiny aubergines the size of peas; hollow bamboo stuffed with straw at each end to trap the savoured grubs inside; dishes of curry to be popped into little plastic bags and taken away; tomatoes, whose heady aroma hit you at 10 paces; plucked chickens; steamed rice wrapped in banana-leaf rolls; bowls of live fish, squirming; pyramids of big, pappy apples; hillocks of tiny water shrimp; stacks of rough, homemade cigarettes and cigars; weird and unidentifiable mushrooms; garlic, galangal, lemongrass ... And all the produce was exemplary: enough to make even the top French provincial vegetable market look tired and inadequate. </p> <p>I'd arranged to meet Vandara for a guided tour. I spotted her in the butchery area and negotiated my way through, getting splattered by blood as the butcher-women wielded their cleavers with vigour. The tables were divided into types of meat. One trestle was just stomachs and livers, the one next to it a mountain of pigs' feet; next to that was a table of furry black lungs slung casually over each other like a pile of coats at a party. Vandara was selecting a chicken from a row of plucked specimens whose feet were sticking up in the air for inspection. Chickens in Laos run wild and free, and seem to have developed extraordinarily large feet and thunder thighs as a consequence. \"Now,\" said Vandara, grabbing a really big pair, \"we get the ingredients and I will show you how to make laap.\" </p> <p> Laap is the national dish of Laos (essentially it is a salad made from meat or fish which is cured in lime juice and mixed with chopped mint and coriander, lemongrass, chilli, galangal and roasted rice powder). It is made as a celebratory dish rather like our family roast on Sunday. </p> <p>Back in Vandara's kitchen, we spent the next hour in a whirr of activity - chopping, pounding, searing, steaming and smelling, while I desperately tried to take recipe notes in between. I learnt that the staple is sticky rice, a semi-translucent variety that balls together like bread, followed by wild greens and river fish, wild birds, insects and game. Most of the population live by subsistence farming, so they eat what they find. But wild food, it seemed, was a primary feature of the cuisine even for the wealthy. </p> <p>\"We always buy jungle food,\" said Vandara again and again, \"much better for you. Natural! Organic! Fish and weed from the river, meat that roam free and leaves from the forest. Even in the city, we buy. The taste is better.\" </p> <p>The laap ready, we sat down to eat. Every mouthful was a sensation of different flavours: fiery hot, savoury, salty, tangy with lime juice, refreshed with mint and galangal - and the textures were surprising too: crunchy with roasted rice and crisp with chopped lemongrass. I scooped it into the edible forest leaves provided beside it. </p> <p>Over the next few days, Vandara took me to fantastic restaurants and showed me her favourite recipes in her tiny kitchen. My last week was spent at her other guesthouse in the village below the spectacular, many-layered Kuang Si Falls - a famous local waterfall that cascades into a series of cool turquoise pools. The village was breathtaking: the natural colours of the stilted, thatched houses against the palms; the wood smoke rising in wisps and melting away into the mountains; the watery-white light of the winter sun; and the sound of babbling water everywhere. </p> <p> Leaving the waterfall after days of feasting wasn't easy, but I had a plane to catch. Next stop was Done Khone, where my journey was to end. Known as the Tahiti of Laos for its languid charm, it is one of thousands of small islands that rise from the Mekong river at the south-western tip of Laos; it is also famed as home to the extraordinary freshwater dolphins of the Mekong. </p> <p>I arrived at night in Done Khone, a place with no mains electricity, no telephones, no cars and a view to the river, softened and blurred in a powder-blue haze. The mist rose and fell in huge plumes before dissipating in the morning light to reveal a woman washing clothes on the rocks. Done Khone is celebrated for its flame trees, coconuts and incense; a sublime combination of fruits, flowers and verdure that fills the air with heady perfume. </p> <p>It would have been difficult to find a fairer spot than my rosewood veranda, but it was time for dolphin spotting. I had been told to follow the old railway trail to the \"dolphin viewing\" village, before the heat of the day, so I began my walk. </p> <p>The French had built the railway, and its bridges, to bypass dangerous river rapids and open a reliable trade route between Vietnam, Cambodia and Northern Laos. I found the remains of a locomotive in the undergrowth near Ban Khonetai, then followed what was left of the tracks, past paddy fields, into primary forest. Most of the railway had been spirited away to make fences and footbridges and those bridges were particularly treacherous. Several times, I had to inch my way along a single precarious, rusting rail on my bottom, then watch as children bicycled over them without a care. After an hour I left the jungle behind me and reached Ban Hang Khone, a sleepy, flower-tumbled village, once an important hub of railway activity. </p> <p>Here, I met Noi, a local guide, hoping for a better chance of spotting a dolphin from his canoe. As we left shore, we both looked doubtfully across the large expanse of caramel-coloured water strewn with stony islets. After a while, we moored up by a rocky outcrop and I clambered out. Noi remained in the boat smoking roll-ups. I sat and waited. </p> <p>Mekong dolphins look similar to Beluga whales; they have a rounded head with no beak and a flexible neck. They have 76 teeth in their famous smile. Sadly, they're among the world's most endangered species. Locally, they are called paa khaa. Laotians neither hunt nor eat the dolphins, believing them to be reincarnated ancestors. One ancient myth tells of a beautiful maiden who was forced into marriage with a hideous python. To avoid her fate, she leapt to her death into the Mekong - the spirits took pity on her though, and transformed her into a paa khaa. </p> <p>The villagers say the dolphin population has halved in the past few years. No one knows why. Environmentalists have helped to organise fish conservation zones and a system of cash compensation for fishermen who release dolphins alive if they are netted. Reports suggest, nonetheless, that the dolphins continue to disappear. There might be as few as 10 left in Laos. </p> <p>\"Paa khaa, paa khaa,\" Noi hissed, flinging his rollie into the water, and pointing to a couple of specks in the distance. There were two, and they were getting closer. Soon they were 50ft away and I could make out their fins as they rose from the water. Then they disappeared. Minutes passed. My heart sank. Well, at least I'd seen them. </p> <p>Then, quite suddenly, six feet from our rock, a dolphin poked its head out of the water and looked me in the eye. I fell back in shock. Noi was so excited he almost lost his balance on the boat. The head disappeared, only to re-emerge a few seconds later with the second one. Now both dolphins were giving us the once over. It was impossible not to anthropomorphise; they looked just like people. Two people smiling at me. And the colour: they were lavender. Not grey like normal dolphins. It was heart-stoppingly wonderful. Then they vanished. </p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Between September 10 and December 4, Trailfinders (020-7938 3939, <a href=\"http://www.trailfinders.com\">trailfinders.com</a>) offers flights to Bangkok with Qatar Airways and a transfer via Bangkok Airways to Luang Prabang for \u00a3604pp; it can also arrange internal flights within Laos to Vientiane and Pakse.

Done Khone is best reached by boat from Pakse. A lovely languid ride.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Where to eat:</strong> Luang Prabang is famous for its unique royal cuisine. Try laap, aw lam stew, fried river weed (given to Russian astronauts for its miraculous nutritional qualities) and the exquisite watercress salad. My favourite is the <strong> Park Houay Mixay Restaurant</strong> (+71-212 260), on Savang Vatthana Road, the best authentic Lao food in town. It is run by Mrs Khanthaly Misaiphon, so make sure she's cooking. (Her aw lam stew is excellent.) The <strong> Malee Lao Restaurant</strong> is also good for real Lao fare on Thanon Phu Vao. If you want a top-of-the range elegant restaurant, expensive wine and a French-trained Lao chef, try <strong>L'Elephant </strong> (+71-252 482). The food is French and Lao, to the highest standard. The night market near the river sells a fabulous selection of street food, as does the huge morning market further back (Thalat Dala). There is also a small morning market for fresh produce around Thanon Kithara street. Get there at 6am for the really interesting wild foods.</p> <p><strong> Further information:</strong><br>Country code: 00 856.<br>Flight time: Heathrow-Bangkok 11hrs, Bangkok-Luang Prabang 1hr 50mins.<br>Time difference: +7hrs.<br>\u00a31 = 19,549 kip.

  "<p><strong> New New Yorker</strong><br> </p> <p> The <strong> Gramercy Park Hotel</strong> - one of New York's most famous institutions, where Humphrey Bogart married Helen Mencken and JFK lived with his parents as a boy - has been bought by Ian Schrager, the godfather of the hip hotel movement. The Gramercy, on Lexington Avenue, boasts vast rooms and gives guests access to New York City's only private gated park. But despite a rich heritage and a loyal following, the grand hotel is starting to fray around the edges. It will close for a major refurbishment early in 2005. </p> <p>Significantly, the new project will not involve Philippe Starck, with whom Schrager famously collaborated in creating the stark, all-white, slightly surreal environment for which his hotels - including St Martins Lane and The Sanderson in London - are well known.

  "<p>We've taken several ambitious holidays with our very young children (Ava now aged 18 months and Theo, three and a half), visiting four different places (in Spain) and travelling long distances (US and Australia) - just as we did before they were born. It was fun but we came back more exhausted than when we left. </p> <p>Recently, we came to the uncomfortable conclusion that, if we are going to remain sane and get any relaxation, the formula has to be: one destination, with pool, close to the sea; other children to keep them company and - oh, great luxury - someone else to take over for a while. </p> <p>We found that formula on the Ionian island of Lefkas, where we were able to recharge our batteries for the first time in nearly four years. The small resort of Mousses lies on the north-east side of the island, not far from the causeway and floating bridge that connects Lefkas to mainland Greece. Agios Ioannis is owned and run by a Greek family and consists of 12 small houses, tastefully furnished and set amid a former fruit orchard and olive grove. Little pathways lead to a big shared pool with a separate children's paddling pool, and a bar/restaurant that serves simple, but good, home-cooked food which you can eat at tables near the pool or have delivered to the terrace in front of your house. So far, so lovely. But what makes the place special for tired parents is that they have a really excellent on-site creche. </p> <p>It probably helps if your children are used to being in a nursery or, at least, have experience of a playgroup; but even if they haven't, the British-trained nannies are skilled at easing children into their new environment. </p> <p>The creche opened this year so all the toys and furniture are in pristine condition. The space is large and airy, a cool oasis from the afternoon heat, but there is also a big garden and sandpit for outdoor games. The children were given their own bags, sunhats and T-shirts and at the end of the week we received a scrapbook with their drawings and collages. </p> <p>My two were delighted to have new toys to play with and activities set up for them and even happier to have a group of new friends. After creche, the kids would carry on with their socialising in the pool, where there were lots of inflatables for them to play with. And then take turns inviting each other back to their \"homes\" for ice-creams. </p> <p>Parents usually book the creche either for a morning or afternoon session, which gives you the best of both worlds. We would spend the mornings with our children exploring the beaches, have a leisurely lunch, and then be back at Mousses for the children to join the creche 1.30pm-5.30pm. </p> <p>One of the best beaches for young children to paddle and gain confidence in the sea is known locally as Gyra, a 10-minute drive from Mousses. The road skirts around a lagoon full of wading birds until it arrives at a long beach of sand and shingle, punctuated every hundred yards or so by 10 or more crumbling windmills or milos. It's an arresting sight, particularly as this is a favourite spot for kite-surfing and the Day-Glo sails circle overhead on the afternoon winds. Continuing past the windmills, you eventually arrive at a taverna right on the beach where you can sit with a glass of wine and wait for your fish to be grilled while the kiddies paddle in calm water and build sandcastles. </p> <p>Setting out one early evening to have a meal with the children in Lefkada, the island's capital - again only a 10-minute drive away - we strolled along the pedestrianised main street leading to the town square, and positioned ourselves in a taverna. Theo and Ava could run around with the local children while the meal was being prepared and we watched the town coming to life. On another night, we booked one of the nannies at Mousses to babysit and explored Lefkada's narrow streets. </p> <p>It's hard to leave the tranquillity of Mousses but if you decide to venture further you can pick up a ferry to one of the neighbouring islands or take the all-day Marine Adventure tour on a traditional wooden caique with onboard aquariums full of sea life. </p> <p>But my children were at their happiest at Mousses; the youngest would don her sun hat and grab her baby flight case before making her way down to the pool for an early morning dip. At 6am. Some things don't change, not even on holiday. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong>Getting there: </strong> Departing August 29, Simply Travel (020-8541 2202, <a href=\"http://www.simplytravel.co.uk\">simplytravel.co.uk</a>) has two weeks' self-catering for the price of one in Mousses - \u00a3655pp for four sharing including flights, and car hire.

My contrary 2-year-old daughter, Delilah, would go for the former every time. No matter how exotic the location, if it's not home, she doesn't want to know. </p> <p>Consequently, holidays are a bit of a dilemma: should we endure a \"child-friendly\" resort for her sake when she's only going to wail \"I wanna go home\" every five minutes anyway? Or opt for adult-friendly on the grounds that we, her parents, may as well be happy? </p> <p>The two options used to be mutually exclusive, but fortunately there is a new breed of hotel that attempts to please both parties. Sani Resort in northern Greece has two of the best: Asterias Suites and Porto Sani Village. If you don't have kids you'll appreciate the design, location (on 7km of white, sandy beach), delicious food and five-star treats like bathrobes, slippers and Korres (luxury Greek line) products in the bathroom. If you do, you'll be thrilled you've got all this plus a free-form kiddies' pool, babysitting on tap, and the kind of benevolent staff who don't raise an eyebrow at toddlers playing ping pong with the breakfast buffet. </p> <p>The Sani Resort is set in 1,000 acres of private ecological reserve in Halkidiki, with four hotels well spread out along a Blue Flag beach. Sani Beach Hotel and Sani Beach Club were built in the 70s, and are definitely old-school \"family hotels\". Porto Sani Village, followed in 2000, a five-star, all-suite resort, designed to appeal to both parents and non-parents alike. The most recent addition, and the very cool flagship, Asterias Suites, had its soft opening last year. </p> <p>Asterias is the modern parent's dream. In fact, it is every boutique beach-hotel lover's dream; the sort of place you'd thought would be off-limits the moment you gave birth. The 50 stylish rooms are light, airy, (air conditioning when you want it; sliding glass doors to let in the sea breezes when you don't); with cool marble floors, large bathrooms, Frette sheets, waffle robes; DVD and CD players, large sea-view terraces upstairs, or fenced private gardens downstairs, leading either to the marina or (best of all) straight on to the sandy beach. The water is clear, calm and shallow, so parents can do lifeguard duty from the comfort of their sunloungers, and if you don't want to consign your little darlings to the slightly distant Kids' Club (free for ages 4-12), the brilliant Babe Watch nanny service is right on the beach. </p> <p>Porto Sani is less designer, more casual (so you worry less about public tantrums). The suites have cooking facil ities and a fridge, and even an extendable washing line on the terrace so you can wash and discreetly dry ice-cream-smeared clothes yourself, and not spend precious holiday funds on laundry. It's not as cool as Asterias, and not directly on the beach (best option is Boussoulas, a five-minute buggy ride away) but well designed, friendly and cheaper. </p> <p> Porto Sani and Asterias flank a swanky marina, where you can ogle the yachts from the wrap-around promenade; shop for shoes, jewellery and chiffon kaftans; and sip sundowners at half a dozen waterside bars. Hungry? Snack on still-warm pastries at the Patisserie; classic Greek holiday fare like moussaka and kleftiko at one of the tavernas; or innovative Hellenic/Oriental fusion in Ntomata, which wouldn't look out of place in Sydney or St Tropez - and you can still take the kids. </p> <p>And Delilah? She ate fresh watermelon for breakfast by the pool, grilled calamari for lunch by the marina, built sandcastles, chased minnows in the shallows, acquired a coterie of international chums on the beach, siesta-ed in our little garden and stayed up way past her bedtime. Every night. But when we got home, she was still more excited by the sight of the railway bridge at the end of our road than all the flash yachts in the marina. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Mediterranean Experience (020-7313 6644, <a href=\"http://www.themed.net\">themed.net</a>) offers seven nights' B&amp;B at Porto Sani from \u00a31,321 per adult (based on two sharing), \u00a3402 per child aged 2-11, including Olympic Airways flights from London and private transfers.

  "Yesterday, William Burdett-Coutts, the director of the Assembly Rooms, one of Edinburgh's most high-profile venues, went on the offensive against the Edinburgh international festival, saying that the fringe should be officially recognised as the primary event in the city in August. <p>\"The Edinburgh festival fringe last year sold over \u00a31m tickets - yet it is still seen as an adjunct,\" he said. \"Shouldn't the fringe change its name to the Edinburgh festival?\" </p> <p>Mr Burdett-Coutts's words mark the latest round in a lengthy pitched battle between the fringe and the official festival; the relationship between the two seems marked by mutual incomprehension and a distinct lack of cross-festival collaboration or cooperative programming. And whereas the international festival receives \u00a32.5m in public money, the fact that the fringe gets just \u00a365,000 has always rankled. </p> <p>Certainly the fringe will feel far from peripheral this month. From its opening tomorrow it will dominate the city until September, with its bizarre and vast array of theatre, comedy and events, with 25,326 performances of 1,695 shows. </p> <p>Next week the international festival kicks off and it will try to persuade audiences that the brash upstart has not to entirely eclipsed the older, staider, but miles more artistically coherent official festival. And that's before you get on to the Edinburgh book festival and the Edinburgh international film festival, the television festival, the art festival - even the jazz festival. </p> <p><b>On the move</b><br> </p> <p>Every year the venues get wilder. This year, not to mention several new-writing ventures inexplicably dangling in a lift above the Pleasance, and a play performed in a laundry about a man talking to his left sock, 2004 sees a curious number of vehicular shows. Perhaps the most oversubscribed has been the Traverse Theatre's A Mobile Thriller by Renato Gabrielli: the audience is driven around in what was going to be a Maserati Quattroporte (but, alas, has had to be downgraded to an Audi A8) and thus can number only three at a time. </p> <p>Motoring enthusiasts can also try out DJ Minicab and Friends, a comedy act in a people carrier. And the Collective Gallery is hosting an off-site exhibition from the British artist Mike Nelson called The Pumpkin Palace: it is, in fact, a 1954 GMC transit bus reimagined as \"a new environment somewhere between a mobile field hospital and an opium den\". </p> <p>It's legendarily hard to find accommodation in Edinburgh during the festival, but only a true oddball would figure that sleeping in a hearse for a month would solve his problems. This, however, is the path adopted by the comedian Donal Norton. \"It's customised with a sound system, a telly, a Playstation and a laptop - all the joys of home,\" he says. However, by Wednesday he had already picked up a parking ticket. And a speeding ticket. It would falsely modest at this juncture not to mention that the Guardian's own G2 double-decker bus will be pitching up at the festival next weekend, where great merriment will doubtless ensue. </p> <p><b> Protest against PLA</b><br> </p> <p>Yesterday the Lawnmarket, in the centre of the city, was temporarily taken over by adherents of the spiritual practice Falun Gong, illegal in China. </p> <p>A group, including two people in cages and one with his wrists chained to a bar above his head, was protesting against the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong, and the fact that a band from the People's Liberation Army of China has been invited to be part of the nightly military tattoo at Edinburgh castle. On Thursday, two protesters from the Free Tibet campaign tried to abseil down the castle, also in protest at the inclusion of the PLA, which has been defended by the tattoo's chief executive and producer, Brigadier Melville Jameson. </p> <p><b>Iraq and terrorism</b><br> </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the Iraq situation and the war on terror informs a hefty number of shows. Playwrights have reacted swiftly to events: The Pull of Negative Gravity by Jonathan Lichtenstein is a Mercury Theatre production appearing at the Traverse. It tells of a farmer's boy who returns from fighting in Iraq. </p> <p>The Greek tragedians have provided inspiration for theatre-makers in Lon don, from Katie Mitchell's production of Iphigenia at Aulis at the National Theatre to Martin Crimp's updating of Sophocles's Women of Trachis at the Young Vic. At the Pleasance, Glyn Cannon's modernisation of Antigone as Gone brings the drama into the age of spin: its opening sees Creon holding a press conference. </p> <p>The Edinburgh international book festival hosts Christopher Hogan, an interrogator for the US forces in Iraq; while Ronan Bennett's new Antonia Bird-directed film, Hamburg Cell, premieres at the film festival, with its tale of the run-up to the events of September 11 told from the point of view of one of the young attackers. </p> <p><b>Burlesque and vaudeville</b><br> </p> <p>Burlesque is wildly fashionable just now, and looks strong at the festival this year. American vaudeville act the Wau-Wau sisters do cheeky, lascivious circus tricks, many of them in the air, at the Pleasance. The Whoopee Club, presenting The Crooked Mirror Cabaret, struts its decadent stuff each night. </p> <p><b>They run and run</b><br> </p> <p>There are often hefty endurance tests in Edinburgh. Last year it was the five-hour epic Korean operas performed by one singer and a drummer in the international festival. Let it be noted that there were more punters at the start than at the end of the performances. This year, surprisingly, the prize for the potentially most gruelling event goes to a fringe show from the comedian Mark Watson, who is promising a solo slot lasting 24 hours. Two questions spring to mind: can anyone be funny for more than an hour and a half on the trot? And: what's the point? </p> <p>Meanwhile, the international festival offers an 11 hour play, the prospect of which has made even hardened theatre critics blanch: Le Soulier de Satin (the Satin Slipper), Paul Claudel's epic set in 15th century Spain, in a magnificent looking production from Orleans. </p> <p><b>Don't give up the day job</b><br> </p> <p>A startling number of shows on this year's fringe are about the lives of their creators. Nancy Cartwright is the voice of Bart Simpson, and her Assembly Rooms show looks behind the scenes at the series, with interjections from Bart himself. Simon Woodroffe tells how he founded the Japanese food chain Yo! Sushi (it is a sad irony that the Edinburgh branch has recently closed). </p> <p>Colin Hay sings and tells stories about being the Men at Work frontman, and in a triumph of self-referentiality at this fringe media circus, the showbusiness PR Mark Borkowski spills the beans on his career as a master of the publicity stunt. </p> <p><b>5 to catch</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b> The Flight of the Conchords</b> They sing folk songs and come from New Zealand. Yet they could be the best comedy on the fringe </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b> Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande</b> Festival director Brian McMaster has brought over three productions by the Hanover State Opera.

  "<p>When Luuk Bouwman finished college he did what so many graduates do and decided to spend a year travelling. </p> <p>He packed his rucksack with clothes and a video camera and jumped on a plane to Peru. Machu Picchu beckoned. But when Mr Bouwman got on to the Inca trail and then further into rural Peru, he took a more unusual route. </p> <p>He slipped into the now ubiquitous - even, he says, in Peruvian one-horse towns - internet cafe, got out his digital video camera and began uploading the tales of his travels on to his website back in the Netherlands. Then, each week, the rest of the world was free to watch his travel diary. </p> <p>Mr Bouwman is the vanguard of the latest internet trend: video logging or vlogging. One step up from the now familiar internet blogger, vloggers upload personal video clips of everything from the US Democratic convention to what they had for their tea, via rants about tax rises and conspiracy theories. </p> <p>\"When I went there were very few video logs on the web and most of them were very introverted,\" says Mr Bouwman. \"I wanted to take this video web log concept and go as far away from technology as possible. So I took it right into the Amazon.\" </p> <p>Mr Bouwman was at an advantage to the average person who wants to take up vlogging: he had just graduated from film school. </p> <p>His website (<a href=\"http://www.tropisms.org\">tropisms.org</a>) has evolved into one of the slickest vlogging sites on the internet. It is a way for him and other young documentary makers to self-publish their work. \"I get up to 500 unique visitors a day, nothing compared to TV, but a full cinema still,\" he says. </p> <p>But not all vlogging is so slick. In its most basic form, vlogging does not require very hi-tech equipment: a digital video camera, a high-speed connection and a host are all that is needed. It is still not an easy pursuit, but the gradual simplification of the technology is bringing an increasing number of people into vlogging - and politicising it. </p> <p>Click on <a href=\"http://www.demandmedia.net\">demandmedia.net</a> and you'll find a video of a Manchester anti-war demonstration posted by Anonymous Hero. It's the sort of rally by school and university students too small to make it on to the national media, but here it is being thrown open to a global audience. </p> <p>\"I set up the site because I saw a need for a portal for independent, grassroots video that wanted to affect social change,\" says Alan Bushnell, who runs Demand Media. But, though Mr Bushnell says he is receiving more submissions, he admits there are obvious limitations with vlogging. </p> <p>\"People are taught to write from childhood, however there is no analogous experience of learning to produce video,\" he says. </p> <p>Steve Garfield, a video producer from Boston, Massachusetts, has no problems with the medium. He uses his website to be a \"citizen journalist\", which he describes as \"anyone who decides to tell a story and share it\". </p> <p>Mr Garfield posts about two vlogs a week, on everything from beer and local human interest stories to an off-beat daily report from the recent Democratic convention. There are still only a few hundred vlogging sites on the web - compared with literally thousands of blogging sites - but Mr Garfield predicts that more internet users will get involved in vlogging once the technological barriers come down. </p> <p>\"As tools come out that make it easier, more people will start creating video blogs,\" he says. \"The barriers to entry now are the number of steps it takes to get a video published on the web.

We got things like a video log of someone recovering in hospital. It was very moving. It's a great way to get people to begin to play around with video.\" </p> <p>But as the technology simplifies and the cost of vlogging goes the way of all new technology and tumbles, the obvious question looms large: why would anyone want to create video log that, at best, a few hundred people are going to see? </p> <p>\"It's a form of self-publicity, of course, anything put out from home pages is self promotion in some form,\" says Mark Griffiths, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University who specialises in the psychology of the internet. </p> <p>\"It may be that they are trying to get an argument out, it may just be a cathartic experience.

  "<p>George Bush's re-election prospects received a severe setback yesterday when government figures from Washington showed the United States economy producing far fewer jobs than Wall Street had been expecting. </p> <p>The 32,000 July increase in non-farm payrolls - described as \"shockingly low\" by one financial analyst - was almost 200,000 down on market predictions and led to a sharp sell-off in shares and the dollar. </p> <p>With jobs one of the main issues in the race for the White House, analysts said the economy would have to put in an improbably strong performance between now and early November to spare Mr Bush the charge of having presided over a loss of jobs during his tenure. </p> <p>\"It's a huge disappointment, a big surprise,\" said Scott Brown, the chief economist at Raymond James in St Petersburg, Florida. \"It implies a very sharp revision to the overall outlook for the economy.\" </p> <p>John Kerry, the Democratic candidate for the White House, has been campaigning hard on the issue of the loss of more than a million jobs during Mr Bush's stewardship - particularly in the swing states of the midwest, where the labour market has been the weakest. </p> <p>Mr Bush's treasury secretary, John Snow, reflected the administration's disappointment that the gain in jobs last month had failed to match Wall Street's 228,000 forecast. </p> <p>\"We're not satisfied,\" Mr Snow said after the release of data from the US labour department. He added that he still expected the economy's underlying strength to keep expansion intact during the second half of 2004. </p> <p>Financial markets, already rattled by rising oil prices, responded negatively to the news on jobs and started to reconsider their view that the Federal Reserve - America's central bank - would raise rates when it meets next week. </p> <p>The possibility that the Fed might leave rates on hold on Tuesday rather than raise them by a quarter-point, to 1.25%, helped to contain the market's fall. </p> <p>After a fall of more than 150 points on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost a further 90 points in New York yesterday morning to trade well below the 10,000 level. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the technology-dominated Nasdaq were both at their lowest levels this year. </p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 index closed down 75.5 points at 4337.9. The dollar lost two cents against the euro and the pound, and was down 1.5% against the yen. Sterling ended the day at $1.8464. </p> <p>On the oil markets, fears that the world's biggest economy might be in danger of losing momentum put a temporary halt to the rise in crude futures, which edged close to $45 a barrel on Thursday night. By lunchtime yesterday, US light crude for September delivery was trading at just over $44 a barrel, slightly down on the day, but traders warned that it might hit $50 a barrel over the coming weeks. </p> <p>A refinery fire in the US coupled with the latest twist in the drama of Russian oil group Yukos added to the nervousness among oil traders. </p> <p>Yukos said its production - which accounts for 2% of global crude supply - could be threatened as early as next week as a result of a Russian government collection order which will confiscate from its bank accounts the $900m required to pay next month's taxes and transportation costs. </p> <p>The justice ministry's news sent Yukos shares dropping yesterday, with the price falling more than 7% in the first 15 minutes of trade on the Moscow Micex currency exchange. Shares were down more than 11% on the Russian stock market at the close of yesterday's trading.</p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill sipped his tea and buttered a piece of cold toast. It was Thursday morning in a small office downstairs at Celtic Park and his day was under way in normal fashion. But a question was begged by a scene of such an eminent manager at breakfast in such a celebrated stadium: where's the jam? </p> <p>The Scottish Premierleague season begins this weekend, champions Celtic starting at home to Motherwell tomorrow. But amid the customary anticipation greeting each new season is ever more vocal anxiety about the state of Scottish football. Once again it is being asked how long Celtic and O'Neill can tolerate what he described as \"the wrong environment\". For both parties, the institution that is Celtic and the ambitious 52-year-old football manager that is O'Neill, the answer is being deferred for another year but, at some point soon, change must come. </p> <p>Money, and the distribution of it, is at the root of Celtic's and O'Neill's dilemma. Unless there is structural movement at league level, Celtic's - and Rangers' - financial harness will feel tighter and tighter as time passes. As O'Neill said, on the morning when the Deloitte and Touche annual review revealed English Premiership yearly turnover has reached \u00a31.33bn: \"Celtic and Rangers are big clubs but TV money is dictating a great deal. We get \u00a31.2m - teams that stay in the English Premiership get \u00a325m-plus. That's a massive dent in us proceeding. Sometimes you look across rather enviously at that. But money seems to follow money, so despite the great size of Celtic, despite the great support, we are in the wrong environment.\" </p> <p>The immediate follow-on would be - is O'Neill? But he is tired of responding to hypothetical inquiries about his future. \"I'll see what develops. This is a big, big season for us, after Henrik Larsson. Let's see how we can do. There is always movement afoot; the game has changed enormously over the past 10, 12 years, and who's to say what will happen? But for Celtic and Rangers to compete at a high level in Europe from this environment is difficult. That's why last season and the season before were excellent.\" </p> <p>O'Neill's managerial excellence is not in doubt, even among Rangers fans. His ability to stay at Celtic has been debated this summer, though, because of his wife Geraldine's illness. Thankfully this week brought \"decent news\" on that, O'Neill adding in trying to distract attention: \"I don't have a monopoly on bad news.\" Family affairs are private and if the strain has been great he appeared well and fresh. \"I always consider myself a bit young. I tell the players I'm a really old man, but if you hang around young players it kind of rubs off on you.\" </p> <p>But, professionally, he has concerns. His is a career characterised by overachievement, at Wycombe Wanderers, Leicester City and Celtic - where the aim is to make it four championships in five seasons, the other being lost on goal difference. But what is more uncertain now is whether his talent can be fulfilled much longer at a club restless in its traditional habitat. It is no slight on Celtic, just recognition that Scotland is not what it was. A move to England still feels a distance away and so Scottish weakness will continue to affect Celtic in Europe, which does seem to be O'Neill's preoccupation. </p> <p>\"At this minute in Scotland only Celtic and Rangers are capable of withstanding a season,\" he said. \"On any given day you can lose, but at the end of the season either Celtic or Rangers will win the league. That wasn't the case before. With respect, the Scottish league, the SPL, is in poor shape, poor shape in the sense that 30 years ago Hearts, Hibs, Aberdeen, Dundee United were pretty strong. </p> <p>\"Does that leave you equipped to play European football? The answer is that if you are playing strong, competitive football every single week, then European football is not as demanding in terms of a leap. You become battle-hardened. I mean, there are only so many sides that can win the English league but the matches are tough every week. In Scotland the opposition do raise their game, and the games are difficult. Don't respect that and you'll get done.\" </p> <p>It felt like a large \"but\" was coming, but no. O'Neill, four years into his time at Celtic, is sensitive to Scotland's domestic situation and was \"not apportioning blame\". And yet having taken Celtic past Blackburn Rovers and Liverpool to meet Porto in the 2003 Uefa Cup final, broadening Celtic's fan base and credibility south of the border, he thought he had foundations to take Celtic beyond Scotland again. But he spent not a penny last summer and then saw Celtic fail to reach the last 16 of the Champions League in December because of an 86th-minute penalty in Lyon. </p> <p>\"The environment in which we are involved does not give us the wherewithal. I understand Celtic looking prudently but our debt is very manageable indeed. The problem is that you can manage debt but expectation remains very high. Trying to manage that with the resources you have is the difficult thing and - occasionally - the frustrating thing. </p> <p>\"The frustration is not always present, but there is no doubt that at this minute, when you see what we have done domestically and in Europe, when you think of Seville and what a driving force that is to push on, the frustration is that, actually to push on, you definitely need strength. Our squad by comparison to other squads looking for the same in Europe is just not there. The periphery here is just not good or strong enough.\" </p> <p>Do not Porto, who overcame Celtic in injury-time in Seville, offer hope to clubs on Europe's periphery? \"What people are trying to say is that the Portuguese League is like the Scottish League. Well, it's not. Celtic and Rangers are two big clubs that would hold their own anywhere, but there are four or five pretty strong teams in the Portuguese League; in Scotland there are two. Portugal can import Brazilians; Deco is Brazilian. Porto are a decent side but along the way they got a bit of luck that perhaps eluded us - Paul Scholes scored a goal at Old Trafford that was disallowed. But you need a bit of luck. Good luck to them.\" </p> <p>O'Neill attributed Porto's success and Greece's at Euro 2004 to a \"collection of circumstances\" rather than an emerging pattern, and again he returned to the power of money in football and the importance of context. </p> <p>\"It is too easy for people to say that Alex Ferguson has everything at his disposal, that everyone wants to play for Manchester United and that it's easier. He's built it. I have the utmost regard for that. And if you can take a minute to reflect, we have got to a Uefa Cup final, been involved in Champions League, got to the Uefa Cup quarter-final last season - it has been a massive rise when you consider Celtic had not been involved in European football after Christmas for 20-odd years. But I don't think people have time for reflection. Life seems to be in a bit of a rush for everybody.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Athens played host to the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, it was deemed inadvisable to include any events longer than 1500m. Today, as the games return to their birthplace, you'd still expect the now-enormous global audience to gravitate to the sprint events for its biggest thrills. But while four years ago Sydney belonged to Cathy Freeman, this time I suspect the longer races may be the real spectacle, the distance runners the stars of the Athens show.</p> <p>In recent years we have seen a change in the way distance events are run in major championships. Slow tactical races are becoming a thing of the past, resulting in some memorable encounters. These games should follow on from last year's feast of distance running at the world championships in Paris - but with one or two happy additions.</p> <p> Thankfully, back in 1896, the games' founder Baron Pierre de Coubertin persuaded the Greeks that they should include the marathon race in the programme. On that occasion it proved the headline-grabbing event - and it may well this time, too. Paula Radcliffe and Kenya's Paul Tergat are two of athletics' biggest names, and a win for Paula may cap a week in which, for once, longer means better.</p> <p>The track action starts with another long-distance candidate for star of the show. The Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele has announced his intention to contest the 5000m and 10,000m, and after setting world records in both events this season, it doesn't look like a hard decision. On the opening night of athletics, all eyes will be on Bekele's showdown with his legendary compatriot (and former mentor) Haile Gebrselassie in the 10,000m.</p> <p> The 22-year-old is driven by a desire to emulate the feat of Miruts Yifter in Moscow in 1980, when \"the Shifter\", as we knew him, took both golds. Bekele looks well placed to achieve his goal, although a nagging achilles tendon problem is giving his opponents some hope.</p> <p>Two evenings later, Radcliffe sets off on her Marathon quest and, in a nice gesture, her race will finish in the same marble stadium (the Panathinaiko) that was used in 1896. She won't be totally blind to the history surrounding the occasion, but don't expect her to pay much attention to the sights along the way. It's a tough, testing course and the hot and humid conditions will be a real factor - but Paula has enough experience and intelligence to overcome both the conditions and her competitors. It won't be a cakewalk but recent signs are good, and the whole nation will be running every step with her.</p> <p>From the longest event to the shortest: a couple of hours later in the modern Olympic Stadium, the sprinters will line up for the 100m final and, frankly, it's anyone's guess who will win. Last year the sprints were disappointing at the world championships, and perhaps the sport's war on drugs is finally having a significant impact.</p> <p>Despite all the controversy hanging over the United States team, though, they still have a formidable speed team, and reigning 100m champion Maurice Greene looks rejuvenated. There were expectations that the emergence of world champion Kim Collins last year would herald a new crop of talent taking over - but I'm not so sure now. The outrageously gifted Jamaican teenager Usain Bolt is struggling with injuries, and we could even see the Greeks lifting that troublesome stadium roof should Olympic 200m champion Konstadinos Kederis strike gold again. Stranger things have happened. The British sprinters will find it tougher than in Paris last year, but Darren Campbell won't be beaten easily - so don't tell him we won't win any medals.</p> <p>Of course, the most exciting athletic event of all may not be on the track (or road) at all. The women's pole vault final may require the world record to be broken just to earn a medal; throw in a classic USA v Russia rivalry (Stacy Dragila v Yelena Isinbayeva and Svetlana Feofanova) and sparks should fly as well as the vaulters. My money is on Isinbayeva.</p> <p>There's a lot more to these games than athletics, of course. The swimming pool always attracts my interest, especially when you've got an American claiming he wants to be the new Mark Spitz. Michael Phelps's belief is bigger than Ian Thorpe's feet and, incredibly, the Aussie legend may be yesterday's man if Phelps gets anywhere near Spitz's 1972 tally of seven golds. Both men are in action on the games' first day proper on August 14.</p> <p>There may be choppier waters at the rowing - and that's not just the British crews' chances. The winds at the rowing centre are notorious and led to many boats sinking at the world junior championships there last summer. But while Matthew Pinsent and his three crew-mates are the big draw, I'm looking forward to seeing Cath Bishop and Katherine Grainger go for gold in the women's pair.</p> <p>No winds at the cycling velodrome but this could be Britain's most successful sport in Athens. Led by Chris Hoy, the team has multiple medal chances and a record of delivering. Two or three golds are possible. So when all the British medals are totted up, I don't think we will be too far away from our impressive performance of four years ago. Athens will hope it measures up to Sydney, too.</p>",

Age 22. Golds to date: 3</p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave <br> It will be interesting to see if Thorpe performs as well as he did in front of his home crowd in Sydney. Obviously he'll win medals - I'm not sticking my neck out by saying that - but I think this guy will be the biggest star of all in Athens, even outdoing his great rival in the pool, Michael Phelps. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos <br> Because of his tremendous record of success, and his popularity in Australia, he'll go into the house expecting viewers to like him and housemates to want to get to know him. But I worry that, given his age, he'll feel a horrible lack of stimulation. A failure to keep occupied could be his downfall. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther <br> An obvious candidate for a trip to Neptune. Zero gravity sensation is not unlike floating in water, so he'd be at home onboard the spaceship, while swim-breathing training would help condition him for work on the surface of the planet. But size of his hands and feet makes finding a spacesuit that fits tricky. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle <br> He's got a hawk face, full of energy, and a downturned nose meaning he doesn't take things at face value. His close-set eyes show a slight lack of tolerance; failure bothers him a lot. The outer edge of his ear is rounded, showing an appreciation of music, and you'll see that in his flowing performance. <br></p> <p>Branded <br> Brands love a nickname and Thorpedo's is one of the best. At home he's bigger than Kylie's bum. But swimming floats few people's boats outside Oz and the US - and even there it's a bit too white bread for your average edgy youth brand. Switch to basketball, mate, and the world is yours. Post-gold brand value: \u00a325m <br></p> <p><strong> Paula Radcliffe </strong> (GB) <br> Marathon Age 30 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>Paula's come back to confidence. She's shown in her last couple of races that she can do what people expect. More importantly she's proved it to herself. She's got that air of confidence which had been lacking for a while. Perhaps the only question now is how she copes with the heat. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>She's extremely smart and her experience of success and failure should equip her well for Big Brother. I expect her to come across as a mediator, certainly not an aggressive personality. As a long-distance runner she should be able to set long-term goals which could see her fare very well. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>Has many attributes required of a space traveller: she is accustomed to deprivation and pushing her body to the limit over prolonged periods, and displays great stamina. But, as a woman, is likely to suffer increased bone demineralisation, putting her at greater risk of brittle bones in later life. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>She's got close-set eyes and pointed features, what I call \"flying wedge energy\": she attacks things and goes for it. Her exposed eyelids give her quick reactions, and those two small mounds on her forehead are signs of an incredible imagination. She will already have visualised herself with her gold medal. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>There's definitely something about her. The eyes, the brain... But there's also a touch of Julie Andrews Syndrome. Her deal with nicey-nicey Cadbury's sums it up: fit but square. Tell us what you really think, Paula! Then we can get Gucci on the phone - big bucks. Or Agent Provocateur? \u00a325m <br></p> <p><strong> LeBron James </strong> (US) <br> Basketball Age 19 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>I suppose it's great that the games have the likes of this multi-millionaire American superstar competing and it's great that LeBron James wants to win a gold medal. Having said that, I really think the Olympics should be the highest pinnacle in your sport - and for basketball, they're not. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>Very young and rich, LeBron might find it hard to settle. He may be confused about where he is, although, given his upbringing (he moved repeatedly as his mother sought work), he can surely cope. My worry is, given his age, if he hasn't built a circle of friends in the first week he could have problems. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>His height would be a major problem in the cramped conditions of a spacecraft, as would his high calorific intake on the almost three-year trip to and from Mars. Coupled with the fact that a ball bouncing on board will not be damped by gravity, James is likely to find a trip to Mars very disorienting. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>He's also got exposed eyelids, showing the speed of his reactions - don't think, act. Rounded ears, too, so he'll flow on court. He sees the whole play but will get impatient when things aren't going well. He talks non-stop and likes to look good. He's probably got a huge wardrobe. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>\"Who he?\" used to be the British response to the huge figures of basketball. But so popular is the sport now that LeBron is already a global star (ask your local comprehensive). As the youngest NBA rookie of the year with a $90m five-year Nike deal, Olympic gold will be academic. Boo. \u00a3200m <br></p> <p><strong> Carolina Kluft </strong> (Swe) <br> Heptathlon Age 21 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>Kluft has been outstanding and Denise ( Lewis, Britain's defending champion) will find it very tough. Denise has been there before, she knows what it's all about and sometimes it's easier to come from behind. But most favourites win - and Kluft is the strong favourite. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>Being the house's one young woman will hold her in good stead, provoking protective impulses in the older women and the men. Her pacifying effect should see her avoid early nomination. Personality will also work in her favour: she's very down to earth, though her athletic success points to an iron will. </p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>As the only multi-skilled athlete, she's an excellent choice to be an astronaut. She's likely to have more effective inter-relationship skills than the men and, like all women, would multi-task very effectively. Her highly developed eye-body coordination makes her a natural to pilot the mission. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Her facial combination is often seen in pro golfers - she has all the competitive traits and is very direct. Her forehead is more linear, suggesting she takes things step by step. Sharp features show she likes to get under the surface, but fine hair means she's sensitive to her feelings being hurt. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Marketing isn't all about image; a real personality helps too. And Kluft has it in spades, so Swedish TV has its anchorwoman until 2060. But can you take the girl out of Stockholm? Come to Britain, Caz. We love a bit of Swede. \u00a310m <br></p> <p><strong> Matthew Pinsent </strong> (GB) <br> Rowing Age 33 Golds 3 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>This four have had their setbacks but they are still seriously good. Matthew and James (Cracknell); won the world championships in 1999 and Ed Coode won the same race in the same boat two years later with Steve Williams. Don't be surprised if they walk away with the gold medal. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>Having lost his other half, he might be better suited to Big Brother than anyone. He's used to working in a team, so should integrate well. But, if he sees this as a chance to prove himself, he may come unstuck. He's intelligent and, even better, has already done TV work. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>High level of stamina would be of great benefit, and is unlikely to suffer disorientation, given his experience of facing in the opposite direction of travel. But may become frustrated by lack of unfrozen water on Mars. Unlike others, could continue to practise his sport almost unaffected by zero-gravity. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>He'd be an excellent coach. He's got two deep lines between his eyebrows, which show his dedication and precision. He's trained to get things right and he's very tenacious. He's also very analytical, which helps in his racing. He enjoys working with people and with information. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Ah, the Olympics. Must be time for rowing then. It used to be right down there with rugby; now it's out on its own. It's just not the same without Redgrave, is it? Sorry Matt, there's only a few million in it for you. \u00a33m <br></p> <p><strong> Maurice Greene (US) </strong> <br> 100m Age 30 Golds 2 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>I've caught a few of the sprint races this year and it seems to be a very mixed bunch. There's nobody really standing out, so Maurice has to be at the top end of that group because of what he's done before. He's been there and done that and knows what it's all about. </p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos <br> This is all about TV wannabes. Has been through a lot in his life but that experience may not benefit him in the house. Like many who find success relatively late, he could be protective of that status and come across as arrogant. As a competitor in the ultimate individual event, he might not be a team player. I can't see him achieving much. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>Noted for explosive power due to his strong muscular development, zero-gravity would cause significant wasting to occur. Psychologically, as a sprinter who survives on his nerves, Greene wouldn't be suited to space, where everything is pre-planned to minimise the risk of catastrophe. </p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Like many athletes, his head is wide at the back and narrow at the front, showing a highly competitive personality. His Greek-shaped nose means he's good with money, while his wide face mirrors his self-confidence. No challenge is too big for him - he's a born athlete <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>The GOAT gets nil points for stealing his acronym from the real 'greatest of all time', but Big Mo looks set to fulfil his boasts of more gold. Then he can trouser another few million off Adidas and top that up with motivational seminars in Japan. But can you really be heroic with a name like Maurice? \u00a330m <br></p> <p><strong> Martina Navratilova </strong> (US) <br> Tennis Age 47 Golds 0 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>Despite Navratilova being the ultimate tennis veteran, this will be her first Olympics. I'm not sure if she's going to win the women's doubles gold (with Lisa Raymond), but she will definitely enjoy the experience. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>The most political housemate. Extremely intelligent, she's also never afraid to speak her mind. She needs a competitive edge in her life but must realise Big Brother is a game not a sport. By the time she works that out it may be too late. A wonderful competitor, but this is not the right format for her. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>As any crew is likely to be multinational, knowledge of east European languages is a great asset. But demand for perfection in herself and others might test interpersonal relationships, while as a leftie she'd find many activities difficult in space as they are ergonomically designed for right-handers. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Close-set eyes and low-set ears: she has high standards and expects the same from others. Her sloping forehead means she's very analytical. The convex nose says she likes to be the boss - you'll see that in her choice of doubles partners. But she's got fine hair, so she's also very sensitive and caring. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>When Martina came out the brands stayed indoors. But that was then. A gold medal now might bring a few more Subaru ads in the States. Trouble is, she's getting on a bit and, frankly, can be a little bit scary. Especially when compared to the new Wimbledon ladies' champion. \u00a321m. <br></p> <p><strong> Haile Gebrselassie </strong> (Eth) <br> 10,000m Age 31 Golds 2 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>If you go into the games as reigning champion, and the Olympics is the pinnacle of what you do, a lot depends on how you deal with that pressure. Gebrselassie is hugely experienced but he's also going to be under huge pressure from his brilliant young compatriot, Kenenisa Bekele. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>I expect him to do very well. He's going into politics when he hangs up his spikes, hinting at a heightened understanding of people. From a poor background he's achieved startling success but he's not in-your-face and won't ignite situations like younger men. Someone with substance. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>Not the stereotypical image of an astronaut but his very efficient use of calories and low body mass make him an attractive choice from a logistics perspective. The solitary nature of his sport, though, raises questions about his ability to interact in this team-oriented and intimate environment. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>The square chin means he's a fighter. He'll go beyond the threshold of most people. He's got a square forehead too, which shows he tends to let work become his hobby. His forehead is very flat, indicating a thinking personality. He's not a people person, not as openly friendly as Maurice Greene. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Boy from the third world makes good. Heart-warming stuff or patronising claptrap? You decide - because Disney are turning his life story into a film. Will the ending be re-shot after Athens? Does he own the merchandising rights? Start queuing now. \u00a320m <br></p> <p><strong> Marion Jones (US) </strong> <br> Long jump Age 28 Golds 3 <br></p> <p>Sir Steven Redgrave </p> <p>If there's any evidence that Marion Jones has been cheating then she shouldn't be competing (her appearance in Athens is in question). It's nice finally to see some of the athletes putting their hands up and, if only under duress, admitting they have been cheating. <br></p> <p>Dr Linda Papadopoulos </p> <p>A housemate who can't be trusted rarely stays for long, and she's got major trust issues - especially with men. Two high-profile relationships have both run into difficulties, and she's got drug problems to boot. She may even be barred from the house before the programme begins. <br></p> <p>Dr Richard Crowther </p> <p>She is likely to find the trip to Mars very difficult: accustomed to explosive activities such as the long jump, her body will suffer from muscle atrophy and bone thinning. But on reaching Mars, with gravity less than half that on Earth, at least she'll find it easy to increase her personal best. <br></p> <p>Naomi Tickle </p> <p>Oval eyebrows suggest her thoughts are very organised. Her square jaw-line hints at a natural inclination towards authority: she doesn't like being told what to do. Her pronounced cheek bones mean she likes to explore new ideas but her upturned nose implies she is very trusting - almost naive. <br></p> <p>Branded </p> <p>Oh dear. Brands can go down as well as up - and it's not looking good for Ms Jones. Her 'white moustache' milk ad might turn out to have been the highlight. Bank the cash now. \u00a314m</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tracey Morris <br> Contact lens optician and marathon runner </strong> <br></p> <p>By the time Tracey Morris sees her first patient of the day at the Albion Street branch of Dolland and Aitchison opticians in Leeds, she has often run farther than many commuters drive to work. Up at 5.30am she runs \"usually between five and eight miles\", showers, grabs some breakfast and still makes it from her home in the suburb of Alwoodley to work in the city centre with time to spare.</p> <p>\"I usually have a cup of tea before I start,\" she says. \"My first appointment is not until 9am.\"</p> <p>It is a schedule which made her performance in April's London Marathon - where she catapulted from relative obscurity into the British Olympic team - all the more remarkable. Prior to that race Morris juggled a 38-hour week and worked through her lunchbreaks in order to squeeze in her training runs. Since her selection her employers have allowed her to cut her hours to two days a week, enabling her to experience what most athletes of her calibre take for granted: training in daylight.</p> <p>\"Before I did London I was running 70 miles a week in the dark,\" she says. \"I would run in the morning before it was light and by the time I got home again it was dark.\" Now, she says, she not only has been able to increase her weekly mileage but has time for \"luxuries like massages\" and can \"run at the hottest part of our day\", to help prepare for the conditions in Athens. What she misses, she admits, is the contrast between full-time work and sport. \"I love both my job and my running and I think they balance each other out well. Because my work is based indoors I used to crave getting outside to run. I don't see my work as a hardship.\"</p> <p>Morris, 36, never intended to become an optician but \"fell into the profession by mistake\". At school in North Wales her ambition was to become a physical training instructor in the RAF, but in 1988 she got a summer job at an optician's and discovered she enjoyed the challenges of the job far more than she expected. \"I then trained for three years as a dispensing optician and a further two years to qualify as a contact lens optician.\" </p> <p>She now sees patients every 20 minutes throughout the day. \"I'm giving new patients a thorough eye test to check their eyes and vision are healthy and I show them how to take their lenses in and out.\"</p> <p>While she says she is unsure precisely what the future holds - \"nothing surprises me any more\" - she intends to return to her regular working hours after the games. \"I could never give up work completely,\" she says.</p> <p>Her colleagues are still trying to adjust to the realisation that Morris is more than an enthusiastic jogger. \"They knew I ran but thought I just did a couple of laps of the park,\" she says. \"After London they were a bit blown away. But then so was I.\"</p> <p>Morris is gradually getting used to her sudden rise in fame. \"One lady I was fitting with lenses recently was convinced she'd met me before, but couldn't think where. Then, as she was leaving she said, 'I know, you look like that runner who's going to the Olympics.' She was so embarrassed when I said well, actually, that is me.\"</p> <p> <strong> Ian Peel <br> Quality control manager and trap shooter </strong></p> <p>If Ian Peel is lucky, he sees his wife, Mary, for a few minutes each afternoon when he arrives home from work. Mostly, though, their weekday schedules are such that the couple \"pass like ships in the night\", Ian completing his 10-hour day as a quality control manager for a Lancashire textile dye company just in time to take over from Mary in looking after their two children, aged six and nine, as she leaves to begin a night shift at the local hospital where she works as a nurse.</p> <p>By any household's standards their routine is time-crunched, but more so when one realises that somewhere outside his work patterns and family commitments, Peel has to find time to train. </p> <p>\"It's not ideal,\" he says. \"A lot of the world's top shooters now practise seven days a week but my nearest gun club is a 100- mile trip to Hull, so I can only get there at weekends.\" </p> <p>In an attempt to compensate for the lack of time he can devote to training, he does dry-firing and visualisation in front of a mirror at home.</p> <p>\"Shooting is all about muscle memory - the more you do, the better you get,\" Peel says. \"Without getting to a gun club this is the next best thing.\"</p> <p>His lifestyle is a balancing act that few are required to attempt in these days of lottery funding and sponsorship. To make up time taken off for competitions, Peel often works on Saturdays.</p> <p>\"Until I won my Olympic silver I would get a lot of jealous jibes about being away so much, but my colleagues are more intrigued these days,\" he says.</p> <p>He admits his job can be stressful at times, \"especially when customers demand to know why their delivery is late\", but it is a pressure far removed from that he experiences in competitions.</p> <p>\"In some ways I think working has benefited my shooting,\" he says. \"I am keener and possibly more relaxed when I finally get to do it.\"</p> <p><strong> Christian Cormack <br> New media specialist and cox of men's eight </strong> </p> <p>Christian Cormack concedes that it is easy for rowers to find their lives completely consumed by their sport. It is, he says, like living in a capsule.</p> <p>\"There are times when it is very difficult to focus on anything but rowing,\" says the 27-year-old cox of the men's eight in Athens. \"But you also have to be aware that it won't go on for ever.\"</p> <p>It was the realisation that his own rowing career is unlikely to extend long past his 30th birthday that prompted Cormack to gain vocational skills.</p> <p>\"Very few athletes end up on the streets but, when you are used to being at the top level of what you do, it can be hard to adjust to doing something else when that comes to an end.\"</p> <p>Cormack is now employed as a new media specialist by the IT company Atos Origin. He originally got the part-time job through the Open (Olympic and Paralympic Employment Network) programme, a joint initiative between the British Olympic and Paralympic associations, UK Sport and the recruitment agency Blue Arrow, which aims to provide elite athletes and coaches with the opportunity to embark on a career path while still pursuing their personal goals in sport.</p> <p>\"I wasn't really well qualified in IT but I have developed a lot of skills on the job,\" Cormack says.</p> <p>Since December 2003 he has been working 10-15 hours a week on a flexible basis. \"There is a real contrast between sport and office life. It can be hard to adapt at first.\" </p> <p>Now , though, he thrives on being in a different environment for a few days a week and says he will look forward to returning in September. \"To other people, being sporty gives you a sort of seniority beyond your job,\" he says. \"They remember who you are because you are the person who leaves to go training and who always arrives at the office looking completely worn out.\"</p> <p><strong> Paul Green <br> Systems administrator and taekwondo competitor </strong> <br> A merging of two more alien worlds is difficult to imagine. In one life Paul Green, who is representing Great Britain at taekwondo in Athens and won a silver medal at last year's world championships, trains twice daily following a punishing programme that incorporates swimming, running and other elements of cross training for his sport. In the other, as a systems administrator for the Thales Group in Stockport, he develops naval technology devices including sonar systems for Ministry of Defence submarines.</p> <p>\"It sounds like they are worlds apart but actually they complement each other,\" he says. \"My job is very stressful but my training helps me cope with that. I go training at 6am and by the time I have finished I feel ready to tackle anything.\" Usually he works a five-day week, starting at 8am and finishing at 5pm, but in January the BOA and UK Sport's Open programme negotiated for him to reduce that considerably, to allow him to dedicate more time to preparing for Athens. He will return to his full-time hours in September.</p> <p>\"It's been great to have more time to train but, when you are away from the office, you really miss it,\" says 27-year-old Green. \"I have been at Thales for seven years and a lot of my friends have been made through work.\"</p> <p>It is, he believes, the stability of work that has benefited him most in terms of enhancing his sports performance. \"With taekwondo I never know where I am going to be,\" he says. \"It's great to travel and I love competing, but there's a lot to be said for coming back to your own bed every night.\"</p> <p> <strong> Helen Karagounis <br> Hat seller and 400m runner </strong> <br></p> <p>It is of constant amusement to Helen Karagounis's staff on the hat and bag stall in Nottingham's Broad Marsh shopping centre, where she works as a supervisor, that her life appears to be one exhausting, flat-out sprint.</p> <p>\"They think it's hilarious,\" she says. \"At the end of the day it's as if I am on my starting blocks to race out of the place and get to the track on time for training, whereas everyone else is off home to put their feet up for the evening.\"</p> <p>Until recently there was a third major commitment in her life, on top of training for the 4x400m relay in Athens and holding down a job which often requires her to be on her feet for nine hours a day. She was also attending lectures in classical civilisation at Nottingham University. With her husband, Leonidis, also being a student - he is studying for a PhD in molecular physiology - Karagounis says she has no option but to work.</p> <p>Although she gets lottery funding of around \u00a310,000 a year, she says that \"with both of us being students, money was understandably tight and we needed to boost our earnings because we were quite a low- income family\". It is only thanks to her salary from the Karroo bag stall that the couple have recently been able to purchase their first house in Nottingham.</p> <p> Not that she is complaining about having to fit so much into each 24 hours. \"I've been working on the stall for 18 months now and, although it can be a bit tiring, I do enjoy it,\" she says. \"Time passes quickly because there is a steady stream of browsers.\" </p> <p>In the build-up to Athens she has become something of a local celebrity. \"People have seen me on the regional news and come up just to see the 'hat and bag lady',\" she says. \"They are all shocked that I do this particular job because it is quite public.\"</p>"
