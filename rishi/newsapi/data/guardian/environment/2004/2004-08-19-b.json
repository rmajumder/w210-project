  "Ayad Allawi's ultimatum yesterday to the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr - who is holed up with his fighters in the holy city of Najaf - was notable for one thing: the lack of a deadline. <p>Reporters who gathered for a news conference in Baghdad were expecting the prime minister to announce that the final military push to remove Mr Sadr from the Imam Ali shrine had begun. </p> <p>But while he made it clear that the time for negotiation was over, Mr Allawi positioned himself behind the peace plan that emerged from this week's national conference, which calls for Mr Sadr to vacate the holy shrine, disarm his militia and join the political process. </p> <p>\"A solution is needed and soon, and we want to use all peaceful means to preserve the holy shrine,\" he said. </p> <p>It was an indication that the prime minister, who has been cultivating his image as a no-nonsense leader, is aware of the risks involved if he or the US forces make a false move in Najaf. </p> <p>If the plan to neutralise Mr Sadr works, Mr Allawi will then have only the insurgency in Sunni areas to worry about. If it fails, his government's aim of restoring security so that elections can be held will be little more than wishful thinking. </p> <p>For while there is little doubt that a US and Iraqi military campaign could dislodge the dedicated but poorly trained al-Mahdi fighters, the political fall-out could inflame mainstream Shia opinion, which broadly disapproves of Mr Sadr and which Mr Allawi desperately needs on his side. </p> <p>In the course of either arresting or killing Mr Sadr and his young armed followers, US and Iraqi forces run the risk of being seen as \"desecraters\" of sacred Najaf, an act that could linger in the minds of any disaffected Shia - the majority in Iraq. </p> <p>\"Anything affecting the holy shrine may result in disaster,\" said Adel al Adib, a senior official of the Dawa party, a a major Shia group which is part of the interim government. \"The reaction will last for a long time.\" </p> <p>The short-term consequences could be destabilising, too. \"It could be portrayed as the first real atrocity of the new interim government,\" Mr Adib said. </p> <p>\"Sadrists have already started likening Mr Allawi to Saddam. If the military way is the only one pursued, it could fail and the government could lose credibility, and where would that leave us on the next step to complete sovereignty? The danger is the government will indeed be seen to be doing things like the former regime.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr, who is in his early 30s, benefits from the popularity of his father, a Shia cleric killed by the Saddam Hussein regime in 1999. </p> <p>He knows he cannot rival the Shia Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in terms of religious standing, but is vying to become the paramount Shia political power. And while Mr Sistani remains away from Najaf - he has just left hospital in London after heart surgery - there is a danger that Mr Sadr's control of Najaf will solidify. </p> <p>Whatever Mr Allawi thinks of Mr Sadr - he is variously described as unstable or stupid by government officials - he has tapped a vein of Iraqi and Arab nationalism and populism, particularly among the poor, frustrated and alienated Shia youth. </p> <p>The unrest has already prompted a number of senior Shia figures in the south to call for secession from Baghdad. </p> <p>Some foreign diplomats question whether the destruction of Mr Sadr would really have a beneficial effect. </p> <p>\"Destroying the Mahdi Army may fragment a group of youths who at least for now are under some sort of control,\" one said. \"If you remove their leadership, then the Shia resistance may get into a macho contest with the Sunni resistance over who can out bomb the other.\" </p> <p>But many agree that the costs of inaction are equally heavy. The number one on most Iraqis' wish list is security, followed by jobs, services and a chance to have a say in their own future. </p> <p>Until now Mr Allawi's unelected administration has bought some breathing space by promising a secure environment that allows the reconstruction of the country and fair elections. </p> <p>\"If the interim government cannot meet its first major challenge, then its credibility will lie in tatters,\" said a western diplomat. </p> <p>\"This is a chance for the new Iraqi state to establish the primacy of the state and the rule of law. National elections with an armed militia on the loose is unthinkable.\" </p> <p>Mr Allawi has gone out his way to open the door to Mr Sadr.\"If the Iraqi people want Mr Sadr to be their leader, they will be able to elect him,\" he said again yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Sadr refuses to recognise the interim government. But his decision this week to agree to the terms of the national conference, plus the presence of his supporters there, indicate some willingness to deal with new institutions in Iraq.</p> <p><b>Weeks of violence</b></p> <p><b>August 5</b> Gunmen attack the Najaf police station with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at 1am.

  "<p>The growing affluence of Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern oil producers from record crude oil prices has triggered huge new consumer demand in the region for an even more precious commodity: gold. </p> <p>While oil prices yesterday broke new records and reached $47.96 (\u00a326.19) a barrel in New York, the World Gold Council reported an 11% rise in volumes - 25% in dollar terms - during the second quarter, compared with the same period last year. </p> <p>Demand for gold in Britain fell 5% as consumers cut spending in anticipation of harsher interest rate rises, but it leaped 12% in Saudi Arabia, while the UAE and other Gulf states saw an 11% rise. </p> <p>China and Vietnam showed 30% and 50% rises respectively, but these figures seemed better because the Sars virus depressed demand in 2003. </p> <p>Other factors helping the overall global demand rise in tonnage terms was stronger global economic growth, the relative absence of price volatility and continuing concerns about the long-term commercial and political outlook. </p> <p>However, there have also been big promotional pushes in markets such as China, where a television advertising blitz has been launched. </p> <p>\"We believe our promotional activities have clearly helped to boost demand in major markets such as Turkey, China and India,\" said James Burton, the chief executive of the WGC. </p> <p>The price of gold rose in New York by more than $3 per ounce to reach $410 yesterday, with traders saying it was being boosted by a combination of the faltering dollar and booming oil prices. </p> <p>The $47.96 a barrel for US light crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up about 70 cents on the closing price the night before, and came despite reassuring developments in the Middle East. </p> <p>Iraqi oil minister Thamer al-Ghadhban said his country was prepared to resume pumping its capacity of 1.7m barrels a day soon from its level of 1m barrels as southern production came back on stream. </p> <p>The latest rally in the price of crude started with Wednesday's report from the US energy department confirming falling gasoline stocks while supply disruption concerns remain in Russia and Venezuela. </p> <p>The soaring price of crude has worried economists, who feel it will damage world economic recovery. While many have predicted that prices will soon breach the $50 per barrel level, some analysts believe the supply fears are being exaggerated by speculators.</p>",
  "The French government returned from its summer break yesterday publicly determined to persevere with an unpopular programme of social and economic reforms, but privately transfixed by the question of who will lead the ruling centre-right UMP party. <p>After the first cabinet meeting of the new parliamentary year, the cabinet's spokesman, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, said the government's responsibility was \"action ... not the interior life of political parties.\" </p> <p>Asked whether the occasion had been marred by tension between President Jacques Chirac, who chairs the weekly meetings, and his increasingly powerful rival, the ambitious young finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy, all maintained a diplomatic silence. </p> <p>Mr Sarkozy, certain to seek France's top job in the 2007 presidential election, has not yet formally declared his desire to take over from Alain Jupp\u00e9, long Mr Chirac's preferred successor at the Elys\u00e9e palace, as head of the party. </p> <p>But he spent his summer holiday energetically building mass cross-party support in readiness for the November elections, and most observers expect him to announce his candidacy for the post, which controls the cash and other party resources necessary for a successful presidential bid, at the end of the month. </p> <p>Even confirmed Chirac loyalists like the environment minister Roselyne Bachelot now seem convinced that the president's most feared enemy will win the UMP leadership by a crushing majority this autumn. </p> <p>\"Nicolas Sarkozy is quite plainly the man the grassroots members want,\" Ms Bachelot said. </p> <p>\"If he doesn't run, it will be a big disappointment for them. He is the best candidate. There's no question.\" </p> <p>The government's immediate priorities are to agree cuts in the 2005 budget to freeze state spending year-on-year, and to slash unemployment by a vast \"social cohesion plan\". </p> <p>Heavily punished in the regional and European elections this year for its reforms to state pensions and the health service, it aims to push through equally controversial reforms in the civil service and in education. </p> <p>Besides the prospect of continued and mounting public resistance to its policies, it will also have to deal with the consequences of Mr Sarkozy's likely appointment as UMP leader. </p> <p>Mr Chirac, who cordially detests his rival and would consider his election as president in 2007 a personal defeat, has decreed that no one can combine a cabinet portfolio with leadership of the UMP. </p> <p>At the very best Mr Raffarin's government can expect a big reshuffle if Mr Sarkozy decides to abide by Mr Chirac's rule. </p> <p>At worst, observers say, it could face open warfare and a catastrophic split in the governing party. </p> <p>\"The coming weeks will be tumultuous whatever happens, and will mark the start of a new political era,\" said one analyst, Pierre Joigny. </p> <p>\"No matter what ministers say about getting on with their jobs, their minds will be elsewhere.\"</p>",
  "These are not happy times at the CIA. In the space of a few short months, two official reports have found the agency principally to blame for failing to prevent the September 11 al-Qaida attack and for claiming that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt there is a lot of blame to go round. The twin fiascos rank as the worst intelligence failures since the second world war. But the two reports, by the September 11 Commission and the Senate Intelligence Committee respectively, were also testaments to political expedience. Both panels were made up of Republican and Democratic loyalists who reached a political compromise by going relatively easy on both Clinton and Bush administrations, and focused on institutional culprits. The CIA, without a defender after the resignation in July of its long-serving director, George Tenet, presented the easiest target. <p>Yet most of the agency's rank and file believe they have done little wrong. They were the first to raise the alarm over the danger posed by Osama bin Laden, long before the 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa. In 1996 they set up a unit called the Bin Laden Issue Station, codenamed \"Alex\", dedicated to tracking him down, only to have one operation after another aborted as too politically dangerous. </p> <p>There are a lot of angry spies at Langley, and one of the angriest is Mike Scheuer, a senior intelligence officer who led the Bin Laden station for four years. While some of his colleagues have vented their frustrations through leaks, Scheuer has done what no serving American intelligence official has ever done - published a book-length attack on the establishment. </p> <p>His book, Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror, is a fire-breathing denunciation of US counter-terrorism policy. In it, Scheuer addresses the missed opportunities of the Clinton era, but he reserves his most withering attack for the Bush administration's war in Iraq. </p> <p>He describes the invasion as \"an avaricious, premeditated, unprovoked war against a foe who posed no immediate threat but whose defeat did offer economic advantage\". He even goes so far as to call on America's generals to resign rather than execute orders that \"they know [...] will produce more, not less, danger to their nation\". Bin Laden, he believes, is not a lonely maverick, but draws support from much of the Islamic world, which resents the US not for what it is, but for what it does - supporting Israel almost uncritically, propping up corrupt regimes in the Arab world, garrisoning troops on the Saudi peninsula near Islam's most holy sites to safeguard access to cheap oil. </p> <p>\"America ought to do what's in America's interests, and those interests are not served by being dependent on oil in the Middle East and by giving an open hand to the Israelis,\" Scheuer argues. \"If we're less open-handed to Israel over time we can cut down Bin Laden's ability to grow. Right now he has unlimited potential for growing.\" What makes these comments the more challenging to the Bush administration is that they come from a self-described conservative and instinctive Republican voter. </p> <p>It seems extraordinary that Scheuer's bosses allowed him to publish his book at all. They had already permitted him one book, Through Our Enemies' Eyes, written anonymously, but that was a more analytical work on Bin Laden and al-Qaida. Imperial Hubris is altogether different: a bitter polemic against orthodoxy and the powers that be. </p> <p>Scheuer was given the green light only on condition that he stuck to a set of ground rules: he would continue to write as Anonymous, he would not reveal his job or employer, and he would refer only to information that is already \"open source\" - ie in the public domain. Inevitably, however, given the controversy surrounding the book, his identity has been leaked (first by a liberal weekly, the Boston Phoenix, then this week by the New York Times). Even now, he sticks closely to his employers' guidelines, refusing formally to confirm his identity, while describing his employers vaguely as \"the intelligence community\". (It is for this reason that he is not permitted by the CIA to be photographed except in silhouette.) Having initially been allowed to give media interviews to promote his book, Scheuer was told earlier this month that he has to ask permission for every interview and to submit an outline of what he is going to say. So far, no interviews have been granted under the new guidelines. </p> <p>His interview with the Guardian is one of Scheuer's last before being gagged. Burly, bearded and in jeans and a loose shirt, his forceful vocabulary is a far cry from the cautious obfuscation that is the native tongue in Washington. Not that he minds rocking the boat a little. \"If getting in somebody's face [helps] prevent the death of 3,000 Americans in New York or the sinking of the Cole in Yemen, or two embassies in East Africa, then I'm in your face,\" he says. </p> <p>His bosses at the CIA have not confronted him over the book, other than to tell him what he can or cannot do with the press. \"I don't think they get it yet. I still think there's a large group in the American intelligence community who talk about the next big attack but really believe 9/11 was a one-off,\" he says. \"I think they believe their own rhetoric that they've killed two-thirds of the al-Qaida leadership, when they killed two-thirds of what they knew of.\" </p> <p>Scheuer says that nearly three years after the September 11 attacks the US intelligence team dedicated to tracking down Bin Laden is still less than 30 strong - the size it was when he left in 1999. The CIA claims that the Bin Laden team is hundreds strong, but Scheuer is insistent that the apparent expansion is skin-deep. \"The numbers are big, but it's a shell game. It's people they move in for four or five months at a time and then bring in a new bunch. But the hard core of expertise, of experience, of savvy really hasn't expanded at all since 9/11.\" </p> <p>The morass in Iraq, meanwhile, is a \"big factor in not allowing us to develop much expertise\" on Bin Laden. \"I think [director of central intelligence George Tenet] said we had enough people to do two wars at once, and clearly that was a fantasy.\" </p> <p>The conclusion of the September 11 Commission - that the al-Qaida plot might have been broken up if the intelligence agencies had cooperated better and shared more information - was accompanied by recommendations for the creation of a national counter-terrorist centre and a national director of intelligence to coordinate the CIA, FBI and other agencies. Scheuer believes this is a classic bureaucratic fix. \"I've never known a dysfunctional bureaucracy made better by being made bigger.\" His answer to the al-Qaida threat, unsurprisingly, is to give his old unit at the CIA, the Bin Laden station, more resources and more firepower. </p> <p>It is a solution forged by the accumulated bitterness of missed opportunities. In one year under his watch, from May 1998 to May 1999, Scheuer reckons the US had up to a dozen serious chances to kill or capture Bin Laden. Only one was taken - a missile attack on an Afghan training camp in August 1998 - but either the al-Qaida leader was not there, or he had left before the missiles landed. </p> <p>Months earlier, however, Scheuer believes there was a far better opportunity to grab Bin Laden. The CIA had made a deal with a group of Afghan tribesmen to raid Bin Laden's headquarters near Kandahar and then take him to a desert landing strip, where a US plane would take him either to America or another country for trial. The plan, rehearsed several times over many months, was in Scheuer's view \"almost a perfect operation in the sense that there was no US hand visible\". But on May 29 1998, according to the narrative in the September 11 Commission's report, Scheuer was informed that the operation had been cancelled because of the risk of civilian casualties. </p> <p>The pattern was repeated on December 20 the same year, when Scheuer's agents were virtually certain that Bin Laden would be staying the night at a guest house in the Kandahar governor's compound. President Clinton's principal national security advisers once more decided that the danger of collateral damage was too high. Afterwards Scheuer wrote to the top CIA agent in the region, Gary Schroen, saying that he had been unable to sleep after this decision. \"I'm sure we'll regret not acting last night,\" he predicted. Yet another opportunity, in Afghanistan, was missed in 1999. </p> <p>Other intelligence veterans are more sympathetic to the policymakers' dilemma, pointing out that if the US had shot and missed Bin Laden, while killing others, the country would have been condemned around the world, potentially winning more recruits for al-Qaida. \"Mike's is the viewpoint of the soldier versus the viewpoint of a general,\" argues Vincent Cannistraro, a former chief of operations at the CIA's Counter-Terrorist Centre. \"There are political judgments made at a higher pay grade. I've been at both sides of that equation and they are difficult judgments to make.\" </p> <p>Scheuer counters that the policymakers are just not asking the right questions. \"The question is always what happens if we do this and we fail. The question is never what happens to Americans if we don't try this,\" he says. \"When I took my oath of office, it was to preserve and protect and defend the constitution of the US. It wasn't 'to preserve and protect and defend as long as you don't kill an Arab prince, as long as you don't offend the Europeans, as long as you don't hit a mosque with shrapnel'.\" Scheuer's constant complaints eventually got him removed from his position at the head of the Bin Laden unit and shifted to a more nebulous training role. </p> <p>To his detractors in the administration, Scheuer is no more than a rogue spy whose career did not turn out the way he had hoped. Certainly he is bitter at being \"sidetracked for the past five years without any sort of explanation from my employers\", but he insists that the issues he raises are far more important than his career. He says his recent adoption of a child deepened his anxiety about the future of the next American generation if the country sticks to its present course. </p> <p>But even if the US scores some significant victories against al-Qaida, Scheuer believes the conflict with Islamic extremism will continue to spiral without a fundamental rethink of US priorities in Iraq and a relationship with Israel that \"drains resources, earns Muslim hatred and serves no vital US national interest\". It is a depressingly pessimistic assessment. Ultimately, \"we only have the choice between war and endless war\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Imperial Hubris is published today by Brassey's, price \u00a312.95.</p>",
  "A global immunisation campaign to save the lives of 2-3 million children a year in the developing world will be launched next year by a $4bn-a-year vaccination project backed by Britain, France and Bill Gates, the multi-billionaire founder of Microsoft. <p>Government-backed bonds will be floated on financial markets to fund the programme, designed to tackle easily preventable diseases. </p> <p>Treasury sources said the proposal was at an advanced stage and would be unveiled in the first half of next year, when Britain intends to make Africa the focal point of its presidency of the G8 industrial countries. </p> <p>Britain was approached by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) - an umbrella body covering governments, NGOs and private sector organisations - to see if it would back a plan to frontload extra cash into health programmes. </p> <p>The UK chancellor, Gordon Brown, believes the plan is \"an innovative proposal\" that could speed up the flow of drugs to tackle diseases such as tetanus, measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B, yellow fever and rotavirus (gastroenteritis). </p> <p>He also sees it as a pilot for his proposed International Finance Facility, a plan to double global aid to $100bn a year through the sale of bonds. </p> <p>\"If, through these means, resources available to immunisation could be scaled up significantly, we have the opportunity to avert two to three million vaccine-preventable deaths every year, especially considering the new vaccines becoming available in the near future.\" </p> <p>Treasury officials said the chancellor had discussed the project with Mr Gates, who has pledged part of his personal fortune to the campaign. </p> <p>The British and French governments, with the World Bank, Gavi and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are now working out the details. \"Bill Gates is a big supporter,\" one source said. \"This is going to be a public-private partnership. </p> <p>The proposal is to float 15-year government-backed bonds on the world's capital markets. There would be two five-year disbursement phases, followed by a five-year period in which those who bought the bonds would be repaid. </p> <p>The Treasury expects that pledges of $400m a year in private and public money could generate 10 times that amount by bond sales. Investors would have confidence in the investment because they would be guaranteed by governments. </p> <p>Gavi estimates that 10 million chil dren under the age of five die every year, and believes that immunisation is vital if the UN is to meet its target of cutting infant mortality by two-thirds by 2015. </p> <p>\"Two to three million children die of vaccine-preventable diseases every year,\" it said. </p> <p>Gavi said the extra money would be spent on effective programmes in 56 low-income countries and on providing more affordable vaccines in middle-income states. </p> <p>In a four-pronged strategy, it would strengthen healthcare systems in poor countries so they could reach the 25% of children not covered by vaccination programmes. </p> <p>It would also embark on a long-term programme of buying new and under-utilised vaccines, launch campaigns to provide nationwide immunity and stockpile oral polio vaccine for an attempt to eradicate the disease.</p>",
  "<p>The most innovative new music is being commissioned for Hollywood soundtracks. Joby Talbot, a modern composer who has scored the music for TV's The League of Gentlemen and arranged for The Divine Comedy, is currently at work on the soundtrack for a Disney film of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams' cult novel that informed the psyches of so many science-fiction-obsessed, bespectacled boys in need of a bit of fantasy in the early 1980s. </p> <p>For Talbot, the commission is a dream come true: he was such a boy. \"Some people can recite the Koran. I can recite The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" says Talbot, who has just woken up from a midday nap after a sleepless night caused by his two-year-old son. We are at his flat in Camberwell, southeast London, where Dr Seuss books sit alongside piles of DVDs and CDs. \"During meeting with the producers, somebody would mention a line and I would have to stop myself from reciting the whole scene for fear that they would assume I was a stalker. I can't quite believe I'm working on the film of it, which is going to be brilliant.\" </p> <p>Talbot occupies a unique place in music. He has been playing classical music since the age of four, when he picked up piano and oboe, and has studied at the Guildhall and worked with Michael Nyman. But he has also spent much of his adult life on the road with pop and rock bands, so he can see what the two distinct musical worlds can learn from one another. </p> <p>Modern classical composers could do with having a pop-style hook to hang a piece on, he claims; and pop and rock musicians could do with learning not to copy what has just been successful. \"The famous statement about classical music is that it's 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. I beg to differ. Having worked with all these pop musicians, I've realised that the initial inspiration is all-important. Too much concert music is based on technique and no idea. And pop music should try and appreciate originality a bit more.\" </p> <p>Talbot is currently preparing for his contribution to the Proms: a piece for the National Orchestra of Wales called Sneaker Waves performed on September 2. \"That's another lifetime dream come true. I spent my youth queuing to get in and daydreaming that one day, I might write a piece for the Proms myself. For a classical musician growing up in London, the Proms is the be-all and end-all; the greatest music festival in the world.\" </p> <p>At the age of nine, Talbot wrote his first piano piece. (\"It was rubbish, don't get carried away with praise about precociousness.\") A few years later, he had a moment of realisation that he wanted to be a composer. \"It's all very well deciding that, but the chances of making a living as a composer in this country are fairly remote. It's almost impossible to survive on writing concert music. A commission fee for writing music is nominal. You receive money when it is performed, but when you've spent six months writing your magnum opus string quartet and it gets performed in a village hall with 200 seats - once - that doesn't amount to much.\" </p> <p>Talbot survived by diversifying. Much of his music has been written in dank dressing rooms with water dripping from the ceiling in-between sound checks for pop concerts. \"My first big commission - a 45-minute orchestral piece - was written on the back of tour buses. It teaches you courage under fire and it's the opposite of sitting in an attic with a quill, waiting for the muse to descend. I would find that an arid and sterile environment in which to work. The isolation approach is very lonely and, dare I say it, rather boring.\" </p> <p>Of his record collection, Talbot is not proud. Van Halen and Aerosmith jostle for space alongside Mendelssohn and Vaughn Williams, and there are even albums that combine the two. \"My wife bought me a record player recently and I was very excited to dig out all my old teenage albums until I saw what they were,\" he says. \"I was really into Yes. I was hugely into War of the Worlds by Jeff Wayne. The bit that always got me is when they talk about the noises on the railway tracks. We lived by railway tracks in Mitcham and I lay awake at night listening to the spooky noises railway tracks make, so when I heard those noises turned into a piece of music I thought it was for me in particular. Also its narrator was Richard Burton, and he was my hero. I would watch The Medusa Touch with a pen and paper so that I could use some of the choice rude lines he came out with at opportune moments. But people like Yes and Jeff Wayne were trying to achieve the unachievable: to write a rock symphony. It simply cannot work. I don't know whose fault the whole thing is. I guess the Who are partially to blame.\" </p> <p>Mahler, Shostakovich and Stravinsky are among Talbot's favourite composers, and he discovered modern composers such as John Adams and Steve Reich at the age of 18. \"It was an angst-ridden teenage thing of liking that rather overwrought music,\" he says. \"I remember going to see a Mahler piece at the Royal Festival Hall and getting terribly over-excited and weeping. I thought that was what you were meant to do; that if you didn't leave the concert in tears then you should ask for your money back.\" </p> <p>It is the world of soundtracks, however, that Talbot sees as the most vital field of modern composition. \"Michael Danner's score for The Ice Storm is just amazing. Carter Burwell, who writes the Coen brothers' music, is brilliant, as is Thomas Newman, who wrote the music for American Beauty and Road to Perdition. The general music scene of the last few years has been pretty piss-poor. The only place to hear amazing, innovative music has been the cinema. You can see that by the fact that John Williams had to create a score as brilliant as Catch Me If You Can in order to keep up. We are in a soundtrack golden age.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ten summers ago, when Old Labour's John Prescott was about to become deputy to the very New Labour Tony Blair, I put in a rare phone call to the Sussex farm of the party's last prime minister, Lord Callaghan. </p> <p>Why? Partly because by the mid-1970s Jim Callaghan had rated the trade union militant-turned-MP, a man who had helped disrupt his own chancellorship a decade earlier, sufficiently highly to offer him the job that Peter Mandelson has just landed, as a British European commissioner. </p> <p>But also because \"Sunny Jim\" had witnessed at close quarters the talent and the tantrums of George Brown, another working-class boy made good in Labour's ranks; one who had become deputy prime minister under Harold Wilson but walked out in a huff in the 1968 (he was foreign secretary at the time), a victim of the booze and his own thin-skinned, volatile temperament. </p> <p>Which was the better bet, I asked Callaghan, Brown or Prescott? \"Prescott,\" he replied without hesitation. \"More disciplined.\" When reminded of this prediction this week, the 92-year-old chuckled and said: \"I'm sorry but I don't talk business on the phone any more.\" Yet there is no disputing that he had been right. </p> <p>It has been touch and go at times, all the same. The Prescott who helped pull a canoeist out of a swirling Welsh river and visited the flash-flood devastation in Boscastle this week (\"John was ridiculed about global warming, but it's coming home to roost,\" says his old friend, the sports minister, Dick Caborn) is still capable of bad-tempered outbursts. Occasionally he still thumps a voter. </p> <p>But he has been here, there and pretty well everywhere by now. As the ex-Bennite deputy leader who helped deliver Blair's symbolic 1996 reform of Labour's sacred clause four - despite his own misgivings - he got the upgrade to deputy PM in 1997. Heading up huge swaths of policy reform, travelling the world as Tony's emissary, Prescott has stayed the course: 66 and still standing. When Blair is away, he is the man in charge. Like Billy Elliot - he saw the film five times - he has beaten the odds and made it. </p> <p>Little wonder that there is now a mellow self-confidence that was not there before. Last winter an architectural writer for the Times came away impressed with Prescott's enthusiasm for cutting-edge design and sustainable communities, though the DPM has since managed to fall out with both traditionalist architects and Lord Rogers - a bit of a moaner, he says. </p> <p>Wind farms - which Green Prescott encourages with gusto - give the countryside lobby additional cause for rage, on top of the arm-twisting he has inflicted on local authorities across southern Britain to build many more homes than they want to build. </p> <p>\"We like him personally as a bluff, blundering creature in British politics. But his decisions are massively damaging, particularly in planning and the environment. He's been a catastrophe,\" says Alan Duncan, who clashes with the DPM as Tory constitutional affairs spokesman, but also suffers plans for wind farms and over-enlarged villages in his Rutland and Melton constituency. </p> <p>If a politician can be judged by his enemies, then Prescott is still proper Labour, though the Fire Brigades Union, which felt the lash of his stubborn tongue during its bitter pay dispute, no longer loves him. Nor does the former merchant seaman's own union, the RMT, which he quit when its new left leadership broke ranks with Labour. He now belongs to Amicus. \"I was born a union man and I will die a union man,\" he says. </p> <p>What does this amount to in terms of achievement as Labour heads into the next election and Prescott faces the prospect of giving up at least some of the power he relishes? In policy terms it is a mixed bag. In 1997 Prescott insisted on an impossibly large department, the environment, transport and the regions. He loved them all, but it was too much for anyone and was broken up. </p> <p>He still has the local government hot potato, housing and planning, urban regeneration and social exclusion, as well as his regions - where he beat a tactical retreat last month. Faced with voter rejection of his regional assemblies for Yorkshire and the north-west he dropped two of the three promised referendums. </p> <p>Given his portfolio, the poor municipal record of his constituency home base of Hull must be reckoned a blot on the Prescott CV. But it is his hopes of an integrated transport policy that have proved most naively optimistic. When he set them out he was deemed \"anti-car\" by those he dismisses as the policy teenyboppers in Downing Street - a bit hard on a Jag-lover. </p> <p>But Blair decreed that transport was not a priority. Voters were attached to their cars. And the scale of under-investment in track maintenance since the botched Tory privatisation was only fully understood after the disasters at Paddington and Hatfield. Labour transport budgets are now distorted by the need to catch up. </p> <p>Yet if public-private partnerships to rebuild public infrastructure have also proved a costly and at times disappointing alternative then Prescott the policy wonk is as much to blame as Blair or Gordon Brown. </p> <p>He was writing policy pamphlets as opposition transport spokesman 20 years ago - and he still believes in PPP. Schools, hospitals, even roads and Channel tunnel links (he patched up the deal that rescued the line through Kent) would not have been there without them. That is the pragmatic Prescott at work - partnership with capital on mutually advantageous terms - the conclusion of a rank-and-file leftwinger who used to share a London flat with Dennis Skinner and, unlike Skinner, didn't mind \"getting shitty hands\" to get things done in office. </p> <p>Skinner too has mellowed and is often more supportive of Blair than Islington radicals who have never lifted anything heavier than a quiche. But the Bolsover MP keeps his wary distance. Prescott is long past that stage. And it is his role as keeper of the peace between Blair and Brown that has added significance to the DPM's late career. </p> <p>Anthony Seldon, Blair's latest biographer, quotes Prescott as saying: \"I'm not going to read that fucking New Labour crap,\" when asked to deliver a Blair speech in 1998. But he has swallowed a lot of the crap in the intervening years, with dignity and grace in what he judges to be the interests of his party. </p> <p>Caborn explains it thus: \"John acknowledges that he owes everything to the Labour party. He's not in it for himself. The only thing he's ever wanted to do is make sure Labour is in power and delivering things for people because the only way you can change society is through politics. Anyone who jeopardises that and starts taking Labour out of power will get the biggest belting from John. He believes the party is above personalities.\" </p> <p>It is not difficult to read that as an indictment of less disciplined colleagues from Ken Livingstone to Clare Short. They would almost certainly reply that Prescott has indulged Blair too much. Others would argue that, in coming to terms with Brown in recent years (they clashed badly long ago), it is the chancellor he has overindulged - until the open Blair-Brown spat last autumn threatened to jeopardise them all. </p> <p>What is not in dispute is that a mutually regarding intimacy has gradually developed between the public school barrister in No 10 and the militant seafarer. Rosie Winterton, junior health minister and another Prescottite, calls it \"a political partnership\" rather than a personal one. \"Admiration and understanding has grown between them during what has been Labour's most successful administration.\" </p> <p>Even Mandelson, with whom Prescott has always had a tricky relationship, has been heard to praise the DPM's role as \"our Willie Whitelaw\", the loyal deputy beyond personal ambition who shores up - and restrains - his leader, as the gallant Tory squire once did Margaret Thatcher. High praise of its kind, though in both partnerships there was never any chance of them going on holiday together. Blair reads and plays tennis, Prescott unwinds by watching TV. </p> <p>What next? Prescott still bridles at the minor public school snobbery of his media tormentors - yesterday's Daily Mail providing another example - but has been encouraged by Blair to shrug it off. Last month he handled a stint of PM's question time, long a Commons torment, with aplomb. </p> <p>This week Mellow Prescott gave way to Furious Prescott again after press reports that he is \"bed-blocking\" the Straws and Blunketts who want his job. His enthusiasm remains undimmed. Whatever happens after the election he will probably stay on as (elected) deputy leader. When the time comes for Blair to stand aside he will back Brown. But, apart from the occasional hint about the party's shifting \"tectonic plates\", Prescott is too canny to show his hand. </p> <p>You do not get from 11-plus failure to deputy PM by being as daft as the Mail keeps telling itself he is.

  "<p>David Bellamy says wind farms have no \"measurable effect reducing the amount of carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere\" (Letters, August 14). There are about 1,100 wind turbines in the UK generating more than 2bn units of electricity a year. That electricity would otherwise have been provided from other sources. The economics of the electricity industry dictate that renewable generation displaces the coal-fired generation first. Those power stations would otherwise be pouring an additional 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere this year. </p> <p>By 2010, we aim to install 3,500 more turbines on and off shore. This will mean the wind industry could then be preventing the emission of up to 17m tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. It will also bring tens of thousands of new jobs and improve our energy security.<br> <strong>Richard Ford</strong><br> Wind Energy Association </p> <p>Every 1kWh of electricity generated from wind will substitute for 1kWh generated from other sources. Bellamy's error may derive from the fact that because the wind does not blow all the time, it is necessary to have alternative plants installed for calm periods.

The fact is turbines do make sizeable reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, as is in Denmark, where 20% of electrical energy is provided by wind with commensurate reduction in emissions.

The real question is what is the pecking order of renewable options when TEA is applied.<br> <strong>Peter Rowland</strong><br> London </p> <p>Wind energy is exceedingly efficient: a wind turbine generates typically 40 times as much energy as was consumed in its manufacture.<br> <strong>Andrew Henderson</strong><br> Stroud, Glos </p> <p>Polly Toynbee rightly describes carbon sequestration as \"the other option\" to nuclear (Countryside alliance, August 13). But as she suggests, it may not help with working out how to provide energy for the post-fossil-fuel future.

These extra costs provide a reasonable incentive to keep on looking for alternatives, if finite fossil fuel reserves are not already enough of a reason. </p> <p>Without some sequestration we run the risk of being saddled, for at least the rest of this century, with a legacy of hastily installed, inappropriate low-emission technologies originally developed for other reasons in the last century.<br> <strong>Jon Gibbins</strong><br> Imperial College London <strong>Dr Simon Shackley</strong><br> Umist </p> <p>For Polly Toynbee to talk darkly of the \"sinister backing of the nuclear lobby\" and to state that \"nuclear power is by far the most expensive option\", is to be economical with the truth.

  "<p>The new Russian owner of sports car maker TVR hopes to bring the comrades in from the cold. The Transport &amp; General Workers Union said last night it had won recognition to negotiate on pay, hours and holidays. </p> <p>TVR Engineering in Blackpool had previously shown little appetite for a formal relationship with unions but now the Russian tycoon Nikolai Smolensky looks set to hold talks with one of the toughest negotiators in the business - T&amp;G general secretary Tony Woodley. </p> <p>The Central Arbitration Committee has given the go-ahead to the union to move ahead with the next stage, a ballot of the workforce. </p> <p>\"We are delighted with this result and look forward to the future with TVR,\" said Mr Woodley. More than 300 staff who hand-build about 800 high-performance cars a year would be covered by the recognition agreement. </p> <p>Mr Smolensky bought TVR from Peter Wheeler for \u00a315m last month. The former chairman of Russian bank OVK, who is only 24, said he wanted TVR to become a global player. He has rejected any large-scale restructuring of the business although this has not stopped rumours that some production could be switched back to the low-cost land of the Lada. </p> <p>But a union spokesman said: \"I don't think he [Smolensky] would have gone to Blackpool and discussed minute details such as the canteen facilities if he was planning to do that [transfer work to Russia].\" </p> <p>Mr Smolensky appears to have bought the company for much the same reason as countryman Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea - he liked the brand.</p>",
  "<p>Corporate mergers in Japan are usually very private affairs. The public knows little about them until the deal is done and dusted. However, the saga unfolding between three of the country's top banks seems to be breaking from this tradition. </p> <p>Last Thursday the ailing UFJ Holdings and the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG) signed a basic merger agreement, which \"when realised, will create the world's largest financial group with assets totalling \u00a5190 trillion [\u00a3950bn], surpassing Mizuho Financial Group and reorganising the nation's financial sector into three massive financial groups\", said the <strong>Yomiuri Shimbun</strong>. </p> <p>The agreement followed a Tokyo high court ruling that overturned a lower court order banning merger talks between the two banks because of an earlier agreement with another Japanese rival. \"In one month, UFJ has offered itself to MTFG; [reneged on an earlier agreement with] Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking Co - which is part of Sumitomo Industrial Group, but separate from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group - to sell it the UFJ trust bank subsidiary; refused to consider SMFG's merger proposal; fought an SMFG injunction halting merger talks; and finally won a high court decision allowing its preferred deal to proceed,\" explained the <strong>Australian</strong>'s Peter Alford. </p> <p>\"Not since Alice popped down the rabbit hole have things looked this curious,\" added the Lex column in the Asian <strong>Financial Times</strong>. </p> <p>The <strong>Asahi Shimbun</strong> reckoned that political and international factors explained why a large part of the UFJ-MTFG merger was in the public domain. \"The finance ministry can no longer call the shots on everything that goes on in the financial industry, and also because of the progression of the globalisation. At any rate, we welcome the open talks about realignment in the banking industry,\" said the paper. </p> <p>That was a view shared by Japan's leading business daily, <strong>Nihon Keizai Shimbun</strong>. \"We hope that the management system of Japan's financial sector will become more transparent by taking advantage of this valuable experience,\" it said. </p> <p>But the <strong>Wall Street Journal Europe</strong> felt that a change in Japan's \"clubby corporate culture, where decisions are made in back rooms\", was not in the offing. UFJ's shareholders have been kept in the dark and the price of MTFG's offer has not been disclosed. \"This ignorance on the part of shareholders was just another symptom of their lack of participation in the decision-making process,\" said the paper. \"Perhaps the saddest thing is that the lack of shareholder involvement in important decisions is seen as the norm in Japan.\" </p> <p>Lex in the FT said UFJ was a bank with a \"ravaged balance sheet\" and a record of evading regulatory inspections. The Japanese government has ordered it \"to shed two-thirds of its \u00a54.6 trillion [\u00a323bn] of bad loans by March\", said the <strong>China Daily</strong>. This was why the financial group was willing to sell out to a stronger bank with more capital, said the <strong> Economist</strong>. </p> <p>But the magazine argued that bank mergers \"will do little for Japan's financial system ... unless they lead to tough treatment of duff loans to 'zombie' firms\", such as the retailer Daiei and the property developer Daikyo, which owe UFJ \u00a5700bn (\u00a33.5bn). \"If a combination of tougher inspections by regulators and fresh capital from a merger partner leads UFJ to get tough on these and other borrows, it will mark huge progress by Japan's worst-managed big bank.\" </p> <p>What MTFG was getting from the merger was \"UFJ's small business and consumer clients, a possible source of profit growth\", said the China Daily. And this might explain why HSBC is taking an interest, noted the <strong>Times</strong>'s Patience Wheatcroft. There were concerns when HSBC bought Household, a US finance group. However, it charges relatively high interest rates to \"relatively lowly\" consumer borrowers, and has had a healthy impact on HSBC's profits, she explained. \"Britain's global bank is now contemplating a carefully targeted attempt to enter Japanese consumer finance, in which interest charges are notoriously high when official rates are still negligible. The latest bout of consolidation ... provides too good an opportunity to miss.\"</p>",
  "<p>World oil prices set yet another record yesterday as fighting continued in Iraq and new figures showed a global economy as yet unbowed by dearer energy and demand continuing to be strong. </p> <p>The renewed surge triggered angry denials from the oil sector that companies had failed to invest in new assets as a ploy to keep prices high. </p> <p>US light crude marched 60 cents a barrel higher to a record of $47.35 before dropping back on profit-taking and reports that rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had agreed to end an uprising in the city of Najaf. </p> <p>Brent crude rose 40 cents to $43.40 before also succumbing to a spate of selling, which pushed it back under the $43 a barrel level. </p> <p>US crude prices have set a record in all but one of the last 14 days and are up almost 30% since the end of June, although once adjusted for inflation they are only just over half the peak set after the Iranian revolution in 1979. </p> <p>Share prices around the world have been depressed by stronger oil prices because stock markets fear a rise in industry's costs and a drop in consumer demand, although oil company shares have done well. </p> <p>Markets rebounded yesterday when oil prices fell back from their highs. In New York the Dow Jones gained more than 0.5% to 10,028 in mid-day trading while the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.5% at 1,821. </p> <p>The surge in oil prices has been driven by the highest demand for the fuel in decades, particularly from the United States and China, at a time when there is little spare production capacity and with output in Iraq stunted by fighting. </p> <p>Markets had been lifted on Tuesday by benign US inflation figures which showed the oil price spike had not yet pushed up inflation. </p> <p>Yesterday German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der tried to play down fears that dearer energy would tip the world into a recession. </p> <p>\"We don't see any negative impact from the oil price and we still have very robust global growth,\" he said. </p> <p>Oil producers' cartel Opec said in a report that it was pumping about 30m barrels a day, up from 29.5m last month. It also forecasts that production in September could reach 30.5m barrels a day out of a total world output of some 81m. </p> <p>Opec production is at its highest in 25 years but that has not been enough to calm mar kets because demand is so strong. </p> <p>The temporary closure of oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Charley has also been blamed for adding to the current high prices. </p> <p>Oil and minerals group BHP Billiton set aside normal oil company restraint in predicting the future direction of crude, saying prices could soon top the $50 a barrel mark. </p> <p>But it dismissed as ridiculous suggestions that oil companies had deliberately reduced spending on exploration and production in order to keep global oil prices high. </p> <p>\"It's opportunity constraint that is the problem rather than a sinister plot,\" said the group's oil boss, Phil Aiken.</p>",
  "An army marches on its stomach, and the British squaddie - for so long reliant on beef stew, suet pudding and hard biscuits - could now be propelled into battle by the more global delights of chicken balti and meatballs and pasta. <p>In the biggest change to the armed forces' rations for 40 years, a new generation of meals are currently being tried out that - despite appearances - are not only supposed to taste better but embrace healthy eating as well. </p> <p>Designed to last for up to three years in any climate, the new boil-in-the-bag meals have been brought in by the Ministry of Defence to try to calm discontent in the ranks over outdated menus, as well as complaints about the quality of British ration packs compared to those given to American GIs. </p> <p>\"Anecdotal evidence has been taken into account from troops who have served with other forces abroad,\" said Brigadier Jeff Little, director of the defence catering group. \"That and the fact that British soldiers have basically been eating the same thing for nearly 40 years.\" </p> <p>So, in a move that would no doubt have sergeant majors twirling their moustaches in disgust, out will go tinned cheese, stodgy casseroles and stale biscuits, to be replaced by peach slices, tuna and mayonnaise and Yorkie bars. Vegetarian and halal options will also be available. However, tradition is not being cast aside completely - custard will still be available for those who want it. </p> <p>\"What we are trying to do is reflect the way people's eating habits have changed and bring the rations into the 21st century,\" Brigadier Little said. </p> <p>So far 60,000 of the new-style ration packs have been distributed across the services, and personnel have been asked to fill out surveys detailing their likes and dislikes. Defence chiefs aim to replace all the outdated rations by 2008. </p> <p>But the MoD has no plans yet to trial US scientists' latest culinary achievement: rations that soldiers can cook in their own urine to cut down the amount of water troops need to carry into battle.</p> <p><b> The old ration pack </b><br> </p> <p> <b> Breakfast</b> Sausage and beans with an oatmeal block </p> <p><b> Lunch</b> Oxtail soup with pate and biscuits </p> <p><b> Dinner</b> Beef stew and dumplings, suet pudding and custard </p> <p><b> Snacks</b> Tinned cheese and pate, boiled sweets, hot chocolate, tea and coffee, biscuits</p> <p><b> And the new </b><br> </p> <p> <b> Breakfast</b> Sausage and beans, cereal </p> <p><b> Lunch</b> Chicken pasta </p> <p><b> Dinner</b> Lamb tikka, peach slices or dried apricots </p> <p><b> Snacks</b> Tuna and mayonnaise, Yorkie bars (complete with \"Not for civvies\" logo), isotonic drinks, tea and coffee, additional seasonings and sauces</p>",
  "Even before that awful bomb ripped through our Baghdad headquarters on August 19 2003, taking the lives of 22 of my colleagues, the UN mission in Iraq had already become marginal to the epic crisis being played out there. Iraq had become the centre of both the US war on terror and the war between the extremities of two civilisations. The vicious terrorist attack a year ago today surprised no one working for Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN secretary general's special representative. Indeed, the UN chiefs of communication in Iraq had met that morning to hammer out a plan to counter the intensifying perception among Iraqis that our mission was simply an adjunct of the US occupation. <p>Little did the Iraqis know that the reality was quite the opposite: by August, the UN mission had grown very distant from the Americans. The intense early relationship that Sergio, the world's most brilliant negotiator of post-conflict crises, had fashioned with Paul Bremer, the US proconsul, had already fractured. Contact was intermittent now that Bremer's coalition provisional authority (CPA) could deal directly with the Iraqis whom it had appointed, with Sergio's help, to the governing council. General dismay over occupation tactics aside, Sergio had already parted company with Bremer over key issues such as the need for electoral affirmation of a new constitution, and the arrest and conditions of detention of the thousands imprisoned at Abu Ghraib prison.</p> <p>The low point came at the end of July last year, when, astonishingly, the US blocked the creation of a fully fledged UN mission in Iraq. Sergio believed that this mission was vital and had thought the CPA also supported it. Clearly, the Bush administration had eagerly sought a UN presence in occupied Iraq as a legitimising factor rather than as a partner that could mediate the occupation's early end, which we knew was essential to averting a major conflagration. </p> <p>Sergio had nevertheless continued to squeeze whatever mileage he could from what he called the \"constructive ambiguity\" of a terrible postwar security council resolution; one that sent UN staff into the Iraqi cauldron without giving them even a minimal level of independence or authority. It is not an exaggeration to say that it was this resolution that rang the death knell for the UN in Iraq. Having heroically resisted American pressure to authorise the war, security council members decided to show goodwill to the \"victors\". \"A step too far\" was how an Iraqi put it to me on my second day in Baghdad. </p> <p>He said that even those who had grown accustomed to the double standards the security council employed in punishing Iraqis for the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, while acquiescing to a quarter-century of Israeli occupation of Arab lands, were horrified that it could legitimise an unprovoked war that the entire world had clamorously opposed. Many Iraqis were also furious that the UN did not raise its voice against brutal occupation tactics, unaware that custom and diplomacy dictated that UN officials say little in public that would offend the world's most powerful state. </p> <p>But by mid-August, a restless and discouraged Sergio had begun to breach the protocol. Two days before the bombing, he told a Brazilian journalist that Iraqis felt humiliated by the occupation, asking him how Brazilians would feel if foreign tanks were patrolling Rio de Janeiro's thoroughfares. And on the day of the bombing, Sergio was going to issue a statement criticising the killing by US soldiers of the Reuters cameraman Mazen Dana as he filmed an incident outside Abu Ghraib prison. That statement saved my life. Sergio asked me to add additional information about other unlawful killings, which made me miss the 4pm meeting that was the target of that attack. Six of the seven participants were killed, and the seventh lost both legs and an arm. </p> <p>August 19 2003 is a pivotal moment UN history, not merely because of the unprecedented viciousness of the attack, but because of the lack of an Iraqi, Arab and Muslim outcry over the atrocity. This near silence exposed the depths to which the organisation's standing had sunk in the Middle East a result of its inability to contain or even condemn the militaristic excesses of US and Israeli policies in the post-9/11 period. The UN is generally considered to be too willing to do the US's bidding, and its rare challenge on the Iraq war authorisation was quickly forgotten once subsequent resolutions pushed the American project in Iraq. Spectacularly egregious was the security council approval of a Spanish resolution condemning Eta for the Madrid bombings when most suspected al-Qaida. This cavalier use of supposedly hallowed security council resolutions was only possible because of support from the US, which wished to protect the Aznar government from electoral defeat.</p> <p>While the security council's double standards over the Middle East are the principal cause of Arab and Muslim hostility, America's ability to pressure UN heads to toe the line is also a vexing problem. The Bush administration continues to impose maximum pressure on Kofi Annan to effect a fuller UN return to Iraq, regardless of the physical danger and moral damage to which this exposes the organisation and its staff. Mr Annan has been resolute on the question of guaranteed security being prerequisite for UN staff returning, but on the question of the need for a democratically elected interim government and, more recently, the composition of the interim government, it has looked if the UN has buckled to US pressure again. When powerful member states find it necessary to give in so often to American demands, it is hardly surprising that an appointed secretary general finds it hard to challenge the US on issues it considers vital. </p> <p>The Bush administration puts relentless pressure on countries to support even the most questionable aspects of its war on terror, regardless of the damage such support might do to their stability. A perfect example is the drive to get a UN mission operational in Iraq under the protection of forces from Muslim countries. Such a presence would pose excruciating risks to both the UN and any countries that comply, notably Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; but such is US power that its \"persuasion\" might succeed. Little seems to have been learned from the cataclysm that befell the UN a year ago today. </p> <p>The UN is precious - not because of its name, but because it struggles, however imperfectly, to reach global consensus on the world's critical issues. The fanatics who blew up the UN mission dealt a severe blow to its fortunes in the Middle East. But more lasting damage is being done to the legitimacy of this irreplaceable institution by demands to obey US dictates. If it continues to bow to pressure, its capital will be squandered and its resolutions rendered weightless for large chunks of humanity.</p> <p>Member states and the secretary general should see this eroding legitimacy as the greatest challenge the organisation faces. But they will be unable to make effective headway unless the US itself recognises that it needs, in its own interest, to show greater respect for the UN, from which it can learn to define and pursue its own interests more wisely. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Salim Lone was director of communications for the UN mission in Iraq headed by the late Sergio Vieira de Mello </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:salimlone@msn.com\">salimlone@msn.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Want to enhance a lifespan? Then get attacked by exogenous bacteria. But it only works if the victim is exposed to bugs early in life.

Flies that were exposed to bacteria during the first four to seven days had their lives extended, although exposure after seven days had no beneficial effect. </p> <p>The researchers also found that if they exposed their little hatchlings to bacteria, and then transferred them to a sterile environment later in life, they lived 10% longer still.

  "<p>Global warming will bring change to California, American scientists report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </p> <p>A team of 19 researchers from a variety of institutions looked at two scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - one, in which governments do something, and another, in which governments carry on as usual - and used two climate models to peer into the future. </p> <p>Even at the most hopeful, heatwaves in Los Angeles quadruple, and deaths from extreme heat multiply two or threefold. Alpine and subalpine forests are reduced by 50 to 75% and snow on the mountains declines by 30-70%. But if governments do nothing, then forests shrink by up to 90%, and so does the snowpack on the Sierra Nevadas. This, along with quite modest declines in winter rainfall, could create a serious problem for California's water rights system. </p> <p>\"This could impact on 85% of California's population who are agricultural and urban users in the Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area and the South Coast, about half of whose water is supplied by rivers of the Central Valley,\" they warn. Paradoxically, earlier runoff from the snowpack may also increase the winter flooding risk.</p>",
  "<p>Is your company's IT strategy in line with its business strategy, and if not, who is responsible? This is the challenge now facing many IT managers, who used to focus on technology, and now have to think about governance across the whole business. </p> <p>IT governance is a huge task, and focuses on five areas: strategic alignment, value delivery, performance management, resource management, and risk management. It involves more than technology: it's about managing people and roles to make sure that business processes are managed appropriately. It is a process that starts with the design and development of a project, and should carry on throughout its life. It means that IT management teams need to understand the business processes they help deliver, and the roles of the team members involved with each system and service. </p> <p>One approach - though perhaps only suited to the largest businesses - is to define an overall enterprise architecture, and set up a committee or \"architecture council\" to make sure that all new projects fit in with both the business' strategy and its planned technical foundations. An architecture council, made up of senior busi ness analysts and IT architects, is a place where the languages of business and IT meet, and both cultures can agree on a single message. </p> <p>The current generation of development tools allows architects to define standards for their development teams, but it's the next generation of tools that have taken the governance lesson to heart. One example is Microsoft's forthcoming Visual Studio 2005 Team System. </p> <p>One of the issues facing IT departments is the number of people involved in a project: business analysts, architects, operations, testers and, of course, developers. Team System is designed to reduce the complexity of the development process by bringing team members into a single collaboration and communications framework. A single portal links all the members of a project team, while familiar tools allow everyone from a project manager to the operations team to work together. </p> <p>Methodologies are an important part of a well-governed development project, whether they're complex Prince-driven systems (the UK government approach named from PRojects IN a Controlled Environment), or streamlined agile methodologies such as extreme programming. Team System is designed to make sure that all the requirements of the chosen methodology are used. </p> <p>The package will ship with a methodology based on Microsoft's own Solutions Framework, but it's possible to build your own methodologies into the package, including coding and testing standards. A key feature is work item tracking. This allows architects and analysts to define just what needs to be done before any code can be checked into a development repository. It's not just code tests that are required: project documentation, or review cycles for architecture and project planning work also need to be tracked. </p> <p>IT governance is also about implementing appropriate tools to manage your systems. The right management tools should help teams deliver flexible responses to rapid changes in business circumstances. </p> <p>Process-based system management such as BMC's Business Server Management tools mean that businesses can align systems management priorities with business objectives. For example, it's important to make sure that the servers that add the most value to your business operations have the highest priority, and that IT is ready to add more capacity when it is needed. </p> <p>Other tools help manage the outside-facing systems, making sure that web servers are available at all times. But management isn't just about ensuring availability. The DVLA is using Tibco's BPM solutions to manage its systems, to help it respond to freedom of information requests, and to ensure data protection compliance. </p> <p>It's also important to ensure the integrity of business information. Too many organisations have too many pools of information, often duplicating content. It's difficult to know where the most relevant piece of information resides, and just what to trust. Now businesses are starting to consolidate data, make sure it is clean, and define master sources for all their key information. </p> <p>Another side of the governance equation is making sure that users behave appropriately online, and avoid any resulting entanglements with the law. The latest security tools help by monitoring network connections, which allow administrators to identify security breaches and violations of company policy and regulations. Other tools monitor email, seeking to ensure regulatory compliance. </p> <p>Finally, IT governance is about more than being on top of what the business systems are doing, and who's doing what in the IT department. It's about developing processes that are in tune with the business needs, so that IT systems deliver services to the business in a way that's possible to measure the value they add. The problems are as much about people and processes as they are about tools - and it's an area where there's unlikely ever to be a one-stop solution.</p>",
  "<p>Taking care of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally is vital if you want to make the most of your time at university. It might sound appealing to spend your student days eating exactly what you like, having random sex with everyone in your corridor and drinking so much that you begin to resemble a pickled egg, but the novelty soon wears off. A certain amount of overindulgence is inevitable (and actually quite fun), but taking a few simple steps to safeguard your health will help to ensure that the coming years pass smoothly and safely.</p> <p>It's a good idea to take a basic first-aid kit with you, containing extra supplies of painkillers and antacids. Condoms and multivitamins will come in useful, as will bumper packets of tea bags and instant coffee. A few carefully chosen books and photos of your friends and family will help to keep you sane at times of stress.</p> <p>If you have time, do some basic research into health and welfare provision at your university; an afternoon on the internet now will save you a lot of time and hassle later. One of the most informative websites is <a href=\"http://www.studenthealth.co.uk\"> www.studenthealth.co.uk</a>, which offers advice on a wide range of relevant issues.</p> <p>Once you arrive, your students' union welfare officer or student support officer and university welfare staff will be on hand to explain the set-up and answer any queries. Most universities organise mentoring schemes, aimed at ensuring that you don't spend the entire week hiding in your room.</p> <p>At the University of Wales, Newport, current students act as Stars (student team accommodation representatives), offering support and guidance to new arrivals. Kingston University students' union operates a similar system, known as \"Freshers' Angels\". At most Oxbridge colleges, freshers are allocated college \"parents\" to ensure they settle in as quickly as possible. Rest assured that these people will be friendly and welcoming: it's their job.</p> <p>It is essential to register with a GP as soon as possible. Most universities or colleges have their own health centres or will recommend a student-friendly surgery nearby, but you can register somewhere else if you wish. At some intercollegiate halls in London, students are only issued with hall passes after registering with a GP. (This could mean you go without your dinner for several days, depending on how organised you are.) Your GP can be a great source of support, and there is usually a friendly nurse available to hand out free condoms and offer confidential advice on everything from herpes to homesickness.</p> <p>Students are particularly vulnerable to meningitis, mainly due to all the snogging and communal living in halls of residence. There is an effective vaccine against one of the main strains of bacterial meningitis (C); have it before you arrive if possible, as new students are most at risk. Many universities have launched campaigns to reduce the incidence of meningitis, and you may receive a letter informing you about the early signs of the illness and the importance of receiving the vaccine.</p> <p>Once you've met your neighbours, unpacked those tea bags and located a good doctor, all that remains is to keep yourself healthy and happy. Don't worry if you feel lonely or unsure of yourself in the first weeks of term - it's entirely normal.</p> <p>You'll experience huge highs and lows at university, so be kind to yourself. Eating and drinking sensibly is vital if you plan to stay on top of things. It is perfectly possible to survive on a diet of Pro Plus, Red Bull, Pot Noodles and nothing else, at least for a while. But, although it might sound dull, a balanced diet, moderate exercise and two litres of water a day will make you feel permanently energised and ready to face another hectic round of socialising, studying and partying.</p> <p>Drinking heavily is bound to leave you feeling tired and irritable. Let's be realistic about it: unless you're teetotal in the first place, there's no point trying to abstain from alcohol during freshers' week. Booze is on tap at every social event. It breaks the ice and offers welcome relief from those fraught conversations about whether you went to Thailand in your gap year, but it's tough on your liver.</p> <p>The safe daily limits for alcohol consumption are two to three units for women and three to four units for men. One unit is equivalent to a small glass of wine, half a pint of lager or a pub-standard gin and tonic. Binge drinking should be avoided, but if you do end up on the tequila slammers in week one, take these simple steps: drink lots of water before you go to bed, have a good fry-up the next day, and don't head straight back to the pub. And remember, your body will need a couple of alcohol-free days to recover.</p> <p>Many young people start smoking at university, which is something they often regret (take it from one who knows). If you smoke already, freshers' week is not the time to give up; if you don't smoke, do yourself a favour and don't start.</p> <p>As for heavier drugs, it might be tempting to use your new-found freedom to experiment with every illegal and mind-bending substance under the sun, but it's hard to study when your brain feels like mush, and it won't do much for your ability to make friends if you're so lethargic you can't get out of bed. That said, plenty of students smoke grass from time to time and very few become addicted to heroin. As with everything else, it's your responsibility to know where to draw the line.</p> <p>Over-consumption of alcohol or drugs won't just leave you feeling blue in the morning: it removes your inhibitions, increasing the chances that you'll end up shagging your less-than-attractive neighbour after a particularly hectic night in the bar. And then you remember, through the haze, that you forgot to pack the condoms, and so did s/he, and before you know it you're sitting in the genito-urinary clinic in the third week of term, wondering where it all went wrong.</p> <p>Quite apart from the emotional damage that one-night stands can cause, unprotected sex exposes you to the risk of unwanted pregnancy and a wide range of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). According to the Health Protection Agency, Britain's teenagers suffer from poor sexual health, with a high level of STDs and teenage pregnancies. New cases of infections recorded at genito-urinary clinics doubled between 1991 and 2001, and are still on the increase. Young people, especially women under the age of 20, are the most affected.</p> <p>Most infections are treatable with antibiotics, but you need to seek help if you've put yourself at risk. If left untreated, chlamydia and gonorrhoea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women; the virus that causes genital warts is linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer. Confidential advice is available from your local GP surgery or genito-urinary clinic; you can also pick up enough free condoms to last a lifetime. If the pressure of staying out of trouble gets too much, panic not. However big or small the problem, there is no shame in admitting that you're finding it tough to cope. As soon as you talk to someone, things will seem more manageable. A veritable army of professionals is available to offer help and support, ranging from university and students' union welfare officers to trained nurses and counsellors.</p> <p>If you have issues with depression, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders or anything else that could cause you problems, it is essential to seek help sooner rather than later. You will be away from your family and oldest friends, and need to create a good support network in your new environment. Make an appointment to see your GP, who can discuss self-help techniques and/or suitable medication with you, and make a referral to a counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist if necessary.</p> <p>University counselling services are usually of a high standard and free of charge. Many students' union welfare offices organise weekly drop-in clinics. Helplines run by students, for students, can be useful for discussing relationship issues or exam stress, and the Samaritans are always available to lend a sympathetic ear.</p> <p>A final word of advice, and one that worked for me: take some regular time out on your own. Going for a walk, reading the Sunday papers or watching a good film can work wonders to calm you down and help you to gain some valuable perspective. Who knows, with a clear head you might even feel like writing an essay or going to a couple of lectures. Anything's possible.</p> <p><strong>Useful links and phone numbers:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.studenthealth.co.uk\">www.studenthealth.co.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/mental\">www.bbc.co.uk/health/mental</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alcoholconcern.org.uk/\">www.alcoholconcern.org.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Drinkline: </strong> 0800 9178282</p> <p><strong>National Drugs Helpline: </strong> 0800 776600</p> <p><strong>Samaritans: </strong> 08457 909090</p>",
  "<p>Another record-breaking crop of A-level results published today provoked a fresh row about the credibility of the so-called \"gold standard\" exam, after headteachers warned last night that with a 96% pass rate and more higher grades, the lower bands of D and E had lost their value. </p> <p>Passes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland rose for the 22nd consecutive year, fuelling the annual chorus of criticism that the exam is easier and prompting claims that on current trends the pass rate could spiral to 100% by the end of the decade. </p> <p>Results of exams taken by more than 250,000 students show that after years of losing ground to girls, boys fought back in 2004, although their achievement was overshadowed by further falls in the popularity of so-called \"hard\" subjects, including physics, French and German. </p> <p>Amid criticism that youngsters were \"working the system\" to try to achieve the highest possible grades to secure a university place, the numbers taking \"softer\" subjects, such as psychology and media studies, which are perceived as easier, saw a corresponding jump. </p> <p>The fact that candidates are allowed to re-take one or more of the six A-level modules has also fuelled the controversy surrounding the exam, although the exam boards and government ministers insist that standards are being maintained. Only one paper in every 25 is now failed. </p> <p>This year's provisional results show an 0.8% percentage point increase in the overall percentage of candidates achieving a grade A (22.4% compared with 21.6% last year), up from less than 10% 20 years ago. With the scramble for university places due to start today, the trend fuelled growing controversy over how universities and employers can distinguish between hordes of candidates clutching strings of straight As. Schools revealed yesterday that some students will learn this morning that they have achieved six straight As.</p> <p>The results are the last before a government-appointed working party announces a new blueprint for the 14-19 exam system, which could eventually replace both A-levels and GCSEs with a new-style English diploma.</p> <p>The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, David Hart, warned last night that A-levels were going the way of GCSEs in the sense that universities and employers were increasingly unlikely to look at candidates with less than a C - effectively considered the real pass. \"Ds and Es are a perfectly good recognition of good teaching and hard work. But I think that, inevitably, we are moving to a situation where As, Bs and Cs are going to be regarded as the benchmark. Employers will increasingly look to As, Bs and Cs as the important benchmark... It seems to be moving towards the situation of GCSEs.\"</p> <p>The core subjects of English and maths are in the top three subjects, with the remainder of the top 10 representing a mix of traditional and newer subject areas. Computing and information and communications technology A-levels slumped down the popularity league - a trend interpreted by some as a sign that IT has now become such a mainstream skill learned at an early age in school that fewer pupils feel the need to specialise in it after 16.</p> <p>Law, psychology and media studies continued a marked rise - particularly among girls. However, religious studies showed the biggest leap, up 13.8 percentage points - a change possibly reflecting a growing interest in faith and world religions post September 11.</p> <p>Teaching unions raised concerns over the continuing freefall in numbers taking physics and modern languages.</p> <p>Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said of physics: \"Over the last five years, the number of students taking the subject at A-level has dropped by 5,200. If this rate of decline continues, will physics become the next Latin and disappear altogether?\"</p> <p>There was a mixed reaction from employers. The director general of the Confederation of British Industry, Digby Jones, said: \"The hard work of A-level students and teachers deserves praise. I am worried that the discussion about grade inflation is taking the education debate in this country on an annual wild goose chase. Grade inflation is an important issue for some universities, but claims that employers are hugely worried are wildly overdone.\"</p> <p>James Walsh, policy adviser with the Institute of Directors, which has been one of the most vocal critics of so-called grade inflation, said: \"Employers and universities are finding it increasingly difficult to select the very best candidates from A-level students. With an ever-growing number of A grade passes being awarded, the brightest students are not shining through.\"</p> <p>He added: \"A-levels may not be perfect, but employers continue to value them. There is certainly no need to subsume A-levels into a multi-tiered diploma.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Phil Willis, said: \"Every year the A-level pass rate goes up. Every year critics say that exams are getting easier. Today's students and teachers are only doing what might be expected of them in a very competitive environment. Pupils choose subjects where they think they can achieve the best grades - hence the fall in the numbers taking science and mathematics.\" Dr Ellie Johnson Searle, director of the Joint Council for Qualifications, which issued the results on behalf of the boards, insisted that standards were being maintained and denied that re-sitting modules was responsible for much of the improvements. \"I think it is a result of better informed choices by candidates and I think this is a reflection of how well the system works.\" </p> <p>The schools standards ministers, David Miliband, declared: \"We are getting better as a country at getting the best out of our young people. We should applaud them and applaud their schools and colleges.\"</p>",
  "<p>Freshers' week is quite surreal. It might be the tension of the months of preparation, or it could be that it's just so fast-paced that you don't have time to think. Or the fact that it's enacted in a high-pitched state of excitement, involves very little sleep and can leave you feeling battered and bruised.</p> <p>In mine, I hitched a lift with a friend up the M1 from London to Leeds with our collective lives in the boot of a very small Fiat. I arrived at a looming, breezeblock building (which has since been demolished, I am delighted to learn). And there I was: new home. New town. New duvet. No friends.</p> <p>Then the door-knocking started, I met my new neighbours and didn't stop talking for a week. For some reason, the overwhelming majority of my fellow hall-dwellers seemed to be very pretty, blonde women. It was terribly confusing and, being awful at remembering names, I was somewhat stuck. The first night I ended up in the pub loudly droning into my pint: \"Why is everyone blonde?\" I'm not sure I made the best impression.</p> <p>It got much better, and luckily the people who were my friends by the end of the first week (and still are, seven years later) didn't hold that first night against me. When you get to university - despite having wanted it for so long - you can't help wondering why you've swapped a safe life with friends and family for a non-existent one.</p> <p>The answer is that it's not non-existent - it's just embryonic. To start with, when you arrive you will be presented with a freshers' pack, which includes a diary of social events to get you going. There is no shortage of places to meet people. What it won't warn you is that the clich\u00c0s are true: the majority of your first conversations will be about A-levels/gap years/degree courses.</p> <p>But don't knock it. Behind the smiley chat, there is a canny scrutiny going on. The subtext is: do I want to be your friend? You'll make a few dodgy judgments and spend the rest of your university career avoiding the people you clung to for that first trip to Morrisons, but on the whole it works. People make their best friends at uni.</p> <p>Making friends is an expensive business. You might be budgeting \u00a350 a week, but in those first couple of weeks you need a little leeway. It's worth budgeting a bit extra to get you through, because the most important thing is to give yourself every opportunity to make those friends. It can be incredibly tempting, on the fourth or fifth night, to lock yourself away for some TV and tinned soup. But it's worth doing it with someone else. Chances are, others are feeling the same and you could avoid looking unfriendly.</p> <p>The other no-no is sex. It is, safer to avoid it when you're not feeling entirely sure of yourself, your environment or the person you have your eye on. They will still be there when you're an old hand at this student stuff in week three and you can avoid any messy mistakes in the meantime.</p> <p>Finally, don't show off. With hundreds of people trying to make their mark, you'll see them everywhere: people talking loudly about their skiing holidays, A grades, music collection ... Try to be yourself. The great thing about university is that there are enough people to provide something for everyone, and you are suddenly propelled into a world where everyone has the fundamentals in common: you're all doing a degree and you're all skint. Nobody finishes university having not made friends.</p> <p>Back to the freshers' pack, where you'll find there's also an academic bit to the first week, which basically consists of registering and getting your NUS card, then resisting the temptation to blow your loan with your new 10% discount in clothes and record shops. The pack will also detail when the freshers' fair takes place and when you can sign up for the medieval reconstruction club, or taekwondo for beginners.</p> <p>Freshers' week is not just about making friends and establishing yourself at university. It's about constructing the infrastructure for a life in what is most probably a new place. Settling into halls, working out where you wash your clothes, find your food and get your hair cut, and finding out about your local doctor and dentist might be among your priorities.</p> <p>You may well need a new bank account (don't be fooled by the freebies: you want to know how long you have to pay off the overdraft after graduation), and perhaps a new mobile phone, too. It can be an administrative mountain.</p> <p>After all the drinking, form-filling and wandering around lost, the first week of lectures can be almost a relief; the normality of finding a routine kicks in and you can start to relax a little. After all, there's another three years of this (at least).</p>",
  "This has been a summer of reflection. Before the August break, I had been involved in a furious argument - well, several - about the Dear Leader. On these pages I'd argued it was time for Tony Blair to bow out. Good friends were appalled. Excellent ministers, who have helped improve this country greatly over the past seven years, let me have it with both barrels. Others phoned up with pained advice to think again. Don't let the frenzied silliness of July at Westminster get to you, they said. <p>So I have been rethinking. No one seriously interested in the centre-left can be immune to the pro-Blair case, from two landslide election victories to the subsequent successes in the fight against child poverty, the minimum wage, and the utter baffling of that once-mighty force, Tory Britain. Nor can we lightly dismiss those twin ancient sins of the left, oppositionism and division. </p> <p>Oppositionism, that rancid loathing for every aspect of power, even Labour power, is an ugly creature: this remains a government full of decent people doing their best. Their motives are good. Many of their achievements are real. Division has scarred the left throughout its history and kept it well away from power. I'm not even entirely immune from the personal Blair case. He remains a charming, impeccably polite, good-natured and amazingly resilient man. </p> <p>Armed with these thoughts and a heavy bag's worth of political reading, the summer crop of Blair biographies, books about Blair's war, Blair's spin doctor, Blair's friend George W, I've been reconsidering. We are not so far from a general election; I have no desire to do the Tories' work for them. Isn't it time to forget the doubts and get behind Tony? </p> <p>Here are a few thoughts it's hard to argue against. First, we are not looking over the precipice to a Tory victory. After the early euphoria of Michael Howard's Commons performances, the Conservatives have failed to move in the polls or to break through in real elections, and are now slumped in listless fatalism. The only time you can get Tories to show real enthusiasm is when they are discussing the leadership battle after the election. Campaign teams are already being put in place. </p> <p>Second, the Labour movement is not a leadership cult. There is a big difference between criticising the current prime minister and leftist factionalism of the old sort. The days of Trots taking over constituency Labour parties did Labour no good. But to pretend that criticising Blair is somehow equivalent strikes me as barmy. Labour needs its free speech, its outspokenness, its arguments, or it isn't a living party at all, merely an electoral machine, oiled with the baubles of office. </p> <p>Third, while it is true that these two New Labour governments have achieved a great deal, a high proportion of that achievement has not come from the prime minister. The remaking of monetary policy; the minimum wage; extra help for poorer working families; the tax rises to pay for a big increase in health spending; devolution for Scotland and Wales; the blitz on unemployment and the concentration on child poverty all originated with the Treasury team, or crusading departmental ministers, or were inherited from John Smith. </p> <p>In traditional parliamentary politics, this would have been unsurprising. It's actually healthy. It's just that we have evolved such a grotesquely leader-focused political culture - one whipped up by the Alastair Campbells of this world - that the discrepancy between the government's domestic achievements (great) and the personal achievements of the prime minister (dubious) seems embarrassing. In other words, to criticise Blair is not to criticise \"his\" government. </p> <p>Blair has his No 10 graph-drawers such as Sir Michael Barber. He is no doubt keen to keep on top of what is happening, from crime to asylum, from the economy to statistics on cancer survival. And he shows an impressive grasp of the numbers. But the ideas came from elsewhere and so does much of the energy. In recent years No 10 has lost its thinkers and its Labour progressives, and has not recruited any more. </p> <p>Instead it has reshaped itself around the prime minister's interests and instincts which are, for the most part, looking towards the world stage. His greatest domestic achievement, in the sense of a policy breakthrough that was down to his own attention and obsessive working, was the Northern Ireland peace process. Following on from that, he has pursued diplomacy and deal-brokering everywhere from the Balkans to Brussels, Washington to Baghdad. It is one of the things he is very good at. </p> <p>Which leads me to the reason I found myself arguing so furiously against him to start with. He has enthusiastically aligned himself with every rightwing force he can find in the world. George Bush is not just a Republican president, but the representative of a tight cluster of big-oil, anti-environmental, tax-cuts-for-the-rich politicians and tycoons. They have shown contempt for Europe, and for global institutions, and seem to see the world as a playground for the projection of America's awesome force. </p> <p>In the Middle East the Iraq war has not produced either stability or democracy. Iraq itself remains a bloodbath. Saudi Arabia is more volatile than ever, and in Israel, Ariel Sharon has just again shown his contempt for the road map. Terrorism is being desperately contained, so far, by western security services but, as Islamic disaffection spreads, only just. </p> <p>Washington's allies are now a strange group of rightwing European leaders, and Blair follows suit. Here's a thought experiment: imagine him taking a holiday with Jacques Chirac. Impossible, isn't it? Blair has isolated himself, not simply on the Sardinian coast with the odious Silvio Berlusconi, but from the European mainstream. </p> <p>Even those loyalists who argue for a \"better Blair\" must have had their optimism shaken by this summer's events: the appointment of Labour's least-favourite politician, Peter Mandelson, to a plum job, followed by those pictures of the Blairs cavorting with Berlusconi. We are, it appears, getting an even worse Blair than before, who delights in deriding his party. </p> <p>Moreover, this Blair is not, despite what his people tell you, the only Labour man who can win an election. Poll after poll has shown that Gordon Brown would win a bigger majority than Blair. </p> <p>Here is the truth I cannot get away from. Blair isn't one of ours. His career as a Labour prime minister has been an exhilarating, infuriating, sometimes hilarious accident. He belongs with them, the people he wants to belong with - the rightwing politicians, the Republican proconsuls, the Italian aristocrats, the global media tycoons. He is at least honest enough to make no pretence about it. As the Irish say, fair play to him. But the result of my rethinking? My good, loyal, hard-working Labour friends - you should reflect a bit yourselves. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Today, the Oval Test match begins. Normally, apart from a few Thermos-toting obsessives from Dorking intent on getting to the Harleyford Road early for the 10.30 start, that would mean little. In the week that the Olympic flame was ignited and the Premiership kicked off, it should mean nothing: a sideshow in the global sporting funfair. But, happily, this year is different. England are winning, are playing exuberant cricket, and have found a new superstar: Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff, the man who has achieved what appeared to be impossible and made cricket sexy again.</p> <p>Since Ian Botham retired more than a decade ago, England have been looking for a new hero. The phrase \"the next Ian Botham\" has been hung around a succession of players' necks and gripped so tightly that they were strangled. David Capel, Derek Pringle, Ronnie Irani. Remember them? Thought not. But Flintoff, after a stuttering start, is living up to the hype. Now 27, he has matured into a destructive batsman who can play long innings, a fiery fast bowler who can disconcert the opposition (witness the way he bounced out the great Brian Lara on Sunday), and a brilliant slip catcher. He is three players in one; the talisman of an increasingly confident team; the hope for the Ashes clash that will dominate next summer. </p> <p>More than that, Flintoff is a player who transcends his sport, one of those rare talents who can attract new converts. Cricket can sometimes seem a trifle slow: Groucho Marx was once taken to Lord's to see a match and, after an hour's play, turned to his host and asked when it was going to start. A Test match can last 30 hours - twice as long as Wagner's Ring cycle. But Flintoff overcomes the prejudice against a long, slow, meandering game that, even after five days (or 10 days in the case of one famous Test in South Africa in 1939), can still end in a draw. He is the sport's great hope for a golden future. </p> <p>Flintoff has been called a \"boy's own hero\", and never was the phrase more appropriate. First, there is the utter simplicity of his approach. When he bats, his principal desire is to hit the ball as hard and as far as possible. He has already struck almost 50 sixes in Test matches and there is no doubt that he will end up as the six-hitting record-holder. Babe Freddie! When he arrives at the crease, his adoring fans start baying for him to smash the ball over the ropes. He has even said that sometimes this puts too much pressure on him, forcing him into wanton aggression too early in his innings. But mostly, he does it anyway: it's the way he plays. </p> <p>There was a very Freddie moment at the Birmingham Test match earlier this month when he launched a six into the upper tier of a stand (while making an extraordinary, match-winning 167). Who should be under the ball but his father, Colin? Dad promptly spilled the catch, for which Flintoff junior gave him a fearful ribbing in his end-of-play interview with Channel 4. Which is the other key point about Flintoff: he is funny, unaffected, unchanged by stardom. He is still the big, brawny boy from Preston who likes a pint and a laugh, and most of all loves the game of cricket. </p> <p>Flintoff is a cricketing Alf Tupper. For those readers who didn't read Victor comic circa 1967, Tupper (\"the Tough of the Track\") was a lovable but tenacious Brit who used to work as a welder, live on fish and chips, and invariably win gold for his country, beating all manner of dodgy Russians, egotistical Americans and Vorsprung durch Technik Germans. It was not enough to win: the winner had to be simple, straightforward, approachable and level-headed, an ordinary bloke like you or me. Win the 1500m? Anyone could do it - just eat an extra portion of cod. </p> <p>Now, of course, it's not cod you have to eat to win gold, but a cocktail of designer drugs dreamed up in California. And Roy of the Rovers is earning \u00a3100,000 a week, shagging his way around the fleshpots of Melchester and playing in a team dominated by footballing mercenaries with unpronounceable names. </p> <p>Cricket hasn't quite succumbed to the 21st century, thank God. The top players do dye their hair, drive sports cars and wear designer sunglasses while they bowl, but they do not indulge in the worst excesses of the modern sportsman. Their saving grace is that they spend so long on the field that they don't have the time to prop up bars or get into fights at nightclubs. </p> <p>Cricket is still played by recognisable human beings. Flintoff is an ordinary genius. Wisden, which this year named him as one of its five cricketers of the year, called him \"a farmhand delighting in the coconut shy\". He brings the characteristics of the village green - a violent swing of the bat, uncomplicated fast bowling, laughter and a sense of well-being - to the Test arena. In an age of paranoia and doubt, Flintoff is liberating, a cold beer on a hot day. If a Test match is, indeed, a sporting Ring cycle, Flintoff is our Siegfried: innocent, fearless, the superhuman shaper of events. </p> <p>Flintoff has only come of age as a cricketer in the past 18 months. He made his debut for England in 1998, but struggled with both bat and ball. He was young, callow, unfit, intimidated by the big names in the England team. His most memorable early moment was when a TV camera panned across the dressing room and spotted a page-three photo in his corner. He was a boy in a man's world. </p> <p>As a youngster, because he was big and immensely powerful, he always played in teams a couple of years above his age group. He still was - and he knew it. After one decent performance against Zimbabwe, he gave himself a public pat on the back. \"All right for a fat lad,\" he said. The humour, self-deprecation and sense of perspective has always been there, in the bad times as well as the good. </p> <p>You only have to see Flintoff interviewed - hands in pockets, smiling, unfazed by the fact that he has just slayed another dragon - to sense that he is rooted. He is unlikely ever to use the third person, as sportsman who get above themselves are sometimes wont to do. </p> <p>In those first years as an England player, Flintoff's \"normality\" was part of the problem: he was too keen on lager and pizzas, not working hard enough at his game. \"Fat Freddie\" was becoming a joke. His manager, \"Chubby\" Chandler, and former Lancashire team-mate Neil Fairbrother read the riot act: he was wasting his talent, was in danger of throwing his career away. He got the message, cut down on the lagers, lost a couple of stone, even took up pilates to strengthen his bad back. </p> <p>This year he has been transformed. His career statistics are still not exceptional: almost 2,000 runs, averaging 32.3 per innings; 85 wickets at a cost of 37.15 runs per wicket. As averages go, they are very average. But this year, he has been phenomenal: a batting average of 55.5 and 30 wickets at 25. Even those figures do not tell the whole story: it is the way he makes his runs, the fire with which he bowls, his playful swagger when he fields. He makes everything seem possible. His team-mates now keep saying they feel they can win from any position, no matter how bleak. They have self-belief. Flintoff is their alchemist. </p> <p>On Monday, it was Flintoff who was at the wicket when England took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the Test series. He had batted sensibly for a couple of hours; then, with victory in sight, he wound himself up and sent the ball into the stratosphere for two huge sixes (where was his father?). To show that he was not just a biffer, he finished the match with a delicate late cut and Old Trafford went wild. A ground on the final day of a Test is often a funereal place: but on this occasion 14,000 had come to celebrate England's new messiah and his team progressing to the promised land. The other Old Trafford is only half a mile away, but for once it was cricket that was getting the attention. </p> <p>His nickname - now universally used except by his mother and his wife-to-be Rachael, who for the moment are sticking with Andrew - was coined by John Stanworth, the coach of the Lancashire second XI. When the strapping 15-year-old turned up one day, Stanworth shouted: \"It's Fred Flintstone.\" It seemed perfect for a larger-than-life figure who would, before the fitness regime, have loved nothing better than to tuck into a dinosaur-burger with extra cheese. </p> <p>The most endearing facet of Flintoff's character is that he is so obviously a team man. His hundred for England in a hopelessly lost cause against South Africa at Lord's last year meant little to him; he could barely bring himself to acknowledge the applause when he was eventually dismissed. </p> <p>Five years ago, the obituarists were sharpening their pens. English cricket appeared to be in its death throes as a national game. \"The script for English cricket now seems to be more like the Book of Job than anything else,\" wrote Wisden editor Matthew Engel in the 2000 edition of the famous almanack. \"The English crisis is now the greatest crisis in world cricket.\" </p> <p>The England team were the worst in the world. Football - both the sport and the soap opera - dominated the media, filled the sports pages to bursting point, was in danger of creating what Engel called a sporting \"monoculture\". County attendances were pathetic (Derbyshire had just over a thousand members, of which 16 were dogs). There was less and less cricket being played in schools, especially state schools. You rarely saw cricket being played in the streets, as you once had.</p> <p>Cricket was deemed slow, irrelevant, meandering; a 19th-century game that offered little to the slick new 21st. Neville Cardus's \"background music to an English summer\" seemed to have no place in the age of rap. It was the game of country vicars and posh blokes with pipes and tweed suits: EW Swanton, CMJ, Blowers; a hangover from the world of squires and blacksmiths. It was history. And then along came Freddie. </p> <p>It would be foolish to ascribe the rebirth of English cricket to one man. Coach Duncan Fletcher must take much credit; ditto former captain Nasser Hussain, whose Taliban-like sense of discipline made England competitive again. Michael Vaughan, the current captain, with his choirboy face and endearing tendency to drop easy catches, is allowing his team to play joyous, uninhibited cricket. Ray Illingworth and the hard-bitten Yorkshire old-timers must wonder what's going on out there.</p> <p>But it is Flintoff who is the symbol of the game's extraordinary renaissance. When he struck the winning runs to wrap up the series win against the West Indies, it was impossible not to share the collective pleasure. Middle-aged men threw their Thermos flasks in the air; young women, abjuring the joys of small-bore shooting on TV, jigged; the many children at Old Trafford dreamed, \"That could be me.\" Alf Tupper had triumphed. It is always said of the great cricketing entertainers that they empty bars. How, these days, the breweries must fear Freddie Flintoff.</p>",
  "<p>A major clear-up operation was under way in Scotland today after two landslides blocked a major road and trapped more than 50 people in their vehicles. </p> <p>The RAF, Royal Navy and central Scotland emergency services were involved in a dramatic three-hour bid to airlift motorists stranded on a stretch of the A85 through Glen Ogle, near Callander. </p> <p>The road, a main route to the Highlands, was cut off after more than two hours of torrential rain sent a torrent of debris streaming down the hillside. One resident in the nearby village of Lochearnhead, around 30 miles from Stirling, described the deluge as a \"disaster\" and told how the extreme weather had flooded homes and businesses in the popular tourist spot. </p> <p>Central Scotland police were continuing a search of the area north of Lochearnhead through the night as a precautionary measure, but the force said there were no reports of any missing persons or casualties. </p> <p>Michael Mulford, a spokesman for RAF Kinloss, said the operation involved a race against the clock, for fear those sandwiched between the two landslides would be swept away by a third. </p> <p>Fifty-seven people had been rescued, he added. </p> <p>\"It is absolutely disastrous. A massive 30ft tree fell across the bridge and much of the road is no longer there. A whole section of the road was just swept away,\" said eyewitness Thomas Orrock, 17.</p> <p>Superintendent Stewart Marshall, of Central Scotland Police, said it was the worst incident of its kind he had seen in his 30-year career.</p> <p>Drivers were being advised to stay away from the area until further notice and to take extra care if they have to travel. </p> <p>Shona Maxwell, from Edinburgh, who was rescued along with her partner after the landslide narrowly missed their car, described the experience as \"pretty terrifying\". </p> <p>\"We had just moved our car in time, or we would have been hit ... we were just grateful that we didn't get caught right in the heart of it, and waited to get winched up,\" she told BBC Radio Scotland.</p> <p>Teams of road workers from road maintenance company Bear Scotland began clearing operations on the A85, using diggers to clear away the tons of mud, rock and rubble which in some places was five or six feet deep. </p> <p>\"The teams arrived immediately following the initial landslide, but had to withdraw from the area as continuing torrential rain and falling debris made the area unsafe,\" said a company spokesman. </p> <p>\"One Bear emergency response crew had a narrow escape as their vehicle was swept away - 80 metres down the gorge - whilst the team was assisting motorists. Noone was injured in the incident.\" </p> <p>The A85 remained closed today north of Lochearnhead, and was also shut between Lochearnhead and Crieff. The A84 south of Lochearnhead to Strathyre was also closed and the A87 at Cluanie was partly blocked by a landslip but was passable with care. </p> <p>In the north-east of Scotland, between 6,000 and 7,000 people were still without electricity following a night of severe thunderstorms. There were also reports of localised flooding in Aberdeen, Forres and Elgin.</p> <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) currently has two flood warnings in place, on the River Spey downstream from Fochabers to Spey Bay in Moray, and the River Carron in Caithness and Sutherland. </p> <p>In County Durham, two young people were winched to safety after their car had been trapped in a swollen river and police and fire crews had tried to reach the pair. </p> <p>Flooding was also reported across Northern Ireland today after a night of heavy rain. </p> <p>There were reports of widespread flooding in the Greater Belfast area as well as Newtownards, Comber and Banbridge in Co Down, Lisburn, Co Antrim, and in Armagh. </p> <p>With further heavy rain and strong winds forecast for many parts of the country over the next few days, the Highways Agency urged drivers to take extra care on the roads. </p> <p>PA WeatherCentre forecaster Jeremy Plester said that hope was on the horizon that conditions will ease by the weekend, before deteriorating again early next week. </p> <p>\"The likelihood is that we will see some sunny and dry spells across most of Britain on Friday and Saturday but it will feel cold in Scotland. However, the picture looks gloomy again for next week with an unsettled outlook,\" he said.</p> <p>In the longer term, experts warned that flooding and landslides like those seen at opposite ends of Britain in the past few days may be the face of things to come.</p> <p>Met Office forecaster Clive Burlton said that while specific events could not be linked directly to global climate change, it was likely severe weather events would become more common. </p> <p>\"The expectation is that there are going to be more heatwaves and more extreme events. These sort of events are expected to increase and there will be more extremes than in the past,\" he said. </p> <p>The European Environment Agency has also issued a stark warning about the future of our weather. </p> <p>\"This report pulls together a wealth of evidence that climate change is already happening and having widespread impacts, many of them with substantial economic costs on people and ecosystems across Europe,\" said the agency's director Jacqueline McGlade.</p> <p>\"The consequences of climate change are a very real and dangerous threat, yet international leaders seem to pay little heed to the warning bells,\" said Friends of the Earth campaigns director Mike Childs.</p> <p>\"The prime minister must convince his fellow world leaders that climate change is as big a threat to people and the planet as international terrorism.\"</p>",

The teams keep swapping serves but not capitalising...</p> <p><strong>3:15pm</strong> As the Robertson/Emms pair take a hammering in the first game, better to reflect on BRITAIN'S FIRST GOLD OF THESE GAMES! Shirley Robertson, Sarah Webb and Sarah Ayton have won the Yngling.</p> <p><strong> 3:12pm</strong> We're on the scoreboard! Shame the Chinese have already clocked up 9!</p> <p><strong>3:11pm</strong> 9-0. Looks like we'll have to write off the first set.</p> <p><strong>3:10pm</strong> The Brits have started nervously, particularly Gail Emms, and the Chinese have picked up on this to race into a 6-0 lead early in the first set. Not looking great</p> <p><strong>3:07pm</strong> The Chinese look impressive and take the first two points of the match but we've just won the serve back, only to immediately lose it</p> <p><strong>3:05pm</strong> Away from the Badminton, there appears to have been a mistake. British sailer Ben Ainslie is still in with a great shout for a Gold. I may have given the impression that silver is his best hope. Humble apologies and thanks to the thousands who've written in to point this out.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> The two pairs are warming up on court now so we're about to get underway. The Chinese are the favourites but the BBC seem to think our couple are in with a shout. They are European champions after all.</p> <p><strong>2:55pm</strong> Right! The men's doubles semi is over.

Can Nathan and Gail take Britain's first Gold of these games? Make sure you follow our coverage of the cocks flying..</p> <p><strong>2:25pm</strong> Another debate comes to a close. Michael Spragg clarifies the Wilding question, \"Everyone, well Ben Roome and Sara Williams, is right. Wilding lost in the quarter-finals then in the repechage. So she's a double loser. She could probably beat me up though\". Call yourself a man?!</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> No point in prolonging the basketball/nationality debate. USA have beaten Australia 89-79.</p> <p><strong>2:15pm</strong> British sporting triumph alert! Laurence Godfrey is into the semi finals of the Archery where he'll face some Italian guy. Surely he's got a three in four chance of a medal now...</p> <p><strong>2:10pm</strong> USA v Australia. It's about a 50:50 split amongst the emails so far. Robert Cross who, judging from his email address should have more important things to think about, sums up the quandry: \"A heart-wrenching choice. The two most triumphal sporting nations, and equally bad winners...I'd probably plump for the yanks, just because while sport is very important to them they do have other defining characteristics as a nation.\" But think about what those characteristics might be, Robert!</p> <p><strong>2:05pm</strong> Wilding confusion. According to Ben Roome, \"unfortunately, Rachel Wilding lost in the repechage of the 78 Kg Women's Judo to So Yeon Lee of South Korea\". Who's right?</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> Without wishing to provoke emnity between readers, I have two answers to Ciaran Norris' question (see 1:35pm). Graeme Currie has written to say, 'why do people (e.g. Ciaran Norris) ask you for information when the Greek organisers have such a good website? Nothing is updated faster. Not even the BBC or the Times Online. Not even CNN or the Canadian Rockies Gazzette'. Guardian Unlimited? However, more pragmatically, Sara Williams informs us that, \"Wilding got through to the last eight but was knocked out in the quarter finals. Did well to beat San Miguel. Lost to Matrosova\". Didn't know bottled beers were competing in Judo. Boom, boom!</p> <p><strong>1:50</strong> Colin Gerrard has emailed with USA related dilemma number two. They are currently losing (by two points in the third quarter) in the basketball (hurrah!) but its against Australia (boo!). Who's got your support? </p> <p><strong>1:45</strong> The calm before the (Badminton) storm? Not much Olympic action at the moment so let's turn our thoughts to sexing up the British performance at these games thus far. Tom Charnock has written in, suggesting a re-think of the medals table. 'How about introducing a points system that would see us shoot up to 12th place?' NB: We're currently 24th. Good news/Bad news: It also puts the USA on top of the pile.</p> <p><strong>1:35pm</strong> Ciaran Norris writes in with a judo enquiry, \"My Mum rang me excitedly to tell me that the sister of an old school friend was on the telly competing in the Judo for Great Britain. Her name's Rachel Wilding and I can't seem to find anything about how she's doing/got on. Can you help?\" Well, not sure if I can, but any Wilding news (or indeed, any other news that excites Ciaran's mum) would be gratefully received...</p> <p><strong>1:30pm</strong> Away from the snake-pit atmosphere of the Badminton, we have some Boxing light-heavyweight second round results: Yevgeny Makarenko (Russia) beat Yoan Pablo Hernandez Suarez (Cuba) 30-18, Andre Ward (U.S.A.) beat Clemente Russo (Italy) 17-9 and Utkirbek Haydarov (Uzbekistan) beat Abdelhani Kenzi (Algeria) 31-19.</p> <p><strong>1:25pm</strong> Apparently the final was a three-set thriller with Zhang Ning coming from one down to overcome the Hollando-Indonesian. According to reports the bronze play off, which saw Zhou Mi beat compatriot Gong Ruina, was a 'lackluster' match.</p> <p><strong>1:20pm</strong> Audina, with the bronze, took the Netherlands' first ever Badminton medal, mainly courtesy of her transfer. She represented Indonesia at the last games. Well played to her agent, I guess...</p> <p><strong>1:15pm</strong> It's more medals for China in the women's singles Badminton final with Zhang Ning beating Mia Audina of the Netherlands. The bronze went to Zhou Mi, also of the People's Republic.</p> <p><strong>1:10pm</strong> Afternoon one, afternoon all. There's much in store, what with the Badminton final at 2.50pm (Britain's first gold?) and loads more to keep you on the edge of your seats...</p>",
  "<p>BHP Billiton, the world's biggest mining company, has doubled its profits in the second half of the year on the back of booming global commodity prices. </p> <p>Massive demand for iron ore, coal and other raw materials - much of it to feed China's industrial revolution - helped raise BHP's net result from $989m (\u00a3535m) to $2.04bn in the six months to end-June. </p> <p>The 12-month total was $3.38bn, the largest profit recorded by an Australia-based company. Annual turnover was up 43% to just under $25bn. </p> <p>Over the last year Chinese business has grown from 6.9% of BHP's total revenue to 9.8%. Demand there is expected to slacken slightly but BHP is confident Chinese growth \"is not a short-term phenomenon\". </p> <p>High oil prices helped BHP but the London-listed group also saw profits from base metals rise more than 300% and stainless-steel materials by almost a similar amount. </p> <p>This comes on the back of huge rises in the commodities markets, where copper is up 60% over the last year. </p> <p>Cash flow after interest and tax at BHP rose 45% to $5.2bn. </p> <p>Record production volumes were achieved at a number of businesses as seven new projects came on stream and several more saw their output ramped up. </p> <p>Shares in the miner, up 45% over the last year, dipped 2% to 514p amid disappointment that profits were slightly lower than expectations. </p> <p>The immediate announcement of a special dividend, expected by some, did not materialise. </p> <p>Chief executive Chip Goodyear insisted the company was still looking at plans to return up to $2bn, including share buybacks, and might still do this at current equity values. With the share price at record highs recently, analysts downplayed the chances of cash being returned this year. </p> <p>Investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded its rating on BHP shares to buy from add. A note from analysts at Dresdner said 2005 earnings a share might rise by 5% \"with further upside on rising oil prices\". </p> <p>BHP said it was well placed to push ahead with various \"growth options\" within its portfolio and increase capacity in those commodities in tight supply. </p> <p>\"Many of these expansions can be brought to market quickly and at low cost, and will be profitable not only in today's strong demand environment but throughout the economic cycle,\" it explained. </p> <p>BHP chief financial officer Chris Lynch said all the company's growth could be financed in-house with gearing at 25%, lower than the company's target range of 35%-40%. Acquisitions are still on the radar, if they \"fit our business strategy\". </p> <p>Among the seven new internal schemes being developed at just under $7bn in total is the Ohanet petroleum project in Algeria, the Hillside 3 aluminium site in South Africa and the Mount Arthur Coal development in Australia. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> African Rainbow Minerals, South Africa's largest black-controlled diversified mining group, saw annual headline earnings per share drop 80% after being hit by a strong rand. Operating profits fell from R521m (\u00a345m) to R404m. </p> <p>These are the first financial results since the company was involved in a merger last April with Harmony Gold, South Africa's biggest gold miner, and base metals producer Anglovaal Mining.</p>",
  "<p>Meet Lil, Helen and Kate Armstrong. It is very likely the identical 18-year-old triplets will adorn tomorrow's front pages. For today they received nine A grades between them and are destined for Cambridge.</p> <p>The three, who studied their A-levels at Truro College in Cornwall, have opted for different subjects - medicine, law and natural sciences. They are believed to be the first triplets to secure places at the university in one year. </p> <p>Helen, who will be studying law at Corpus Christi College, and hopes to become a solicitor or barrister, said: \"I am speechless - it's just a great relief to finally know we're all going.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, William Wheeler, from Magdalen College school in Oxford, got eight top grades: six As at A-level and a further two Advanced Extension Awards. Two years ago he got 16 top grades in his GCSEs, prompting the Sun to describe him as \"Britain's brainiest boy\". He's now destined for Magdalen College, Oxford University. </p> <p>Asked what he thought about the annual row over A-levels, Williams said: \"I think it's a bit harsh. The debate comes up at a time when everyone has just got their results. It is important that the debate happens, because it is important that standards are maintained, but it is a bit harsh that it comes up at this particular time.\"</p> <p>But does he think the exams are as hard as they used to be? \"Probably not, because I've seen A-level papers from 20 years ago and they seem to be much harder. They seem to have much tougher questions requiring more independent thought.\" </p> <p>Adam Buckland, 13, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, got a C in computing, after a year's part-time study. He's got his priorities straight: he's looking forward to a career in computer games. </p> <p>Adam is this year's success story from Ryde College, in Watford, Hertfordshire, which is famous for coaching young people through exams. </p> <p>The teenager is not the youngest person to pass an A-level. That honour is believed to be held by Ganesh Sittampalam, who got an A in maths in 1988 when he was nine years and four months old. </p> <p>But today's A-level stories are not all prodigy or private school. </p> <p>Rosie Green will start at Blackpool and Fylde College in September on a creative writing, English language and literature degree course. The 23-year-old, from Blackpool, who gave birth to Jake, now four, when she was 19, got A grades in English literature and history and a B in English language at the same college. </p> <p>She said: \"I've always wanted to go to university and I've always been academic. I've always been driven by the fact I wanted to earn enough to give Jake a good life.\" </p> <p>Zoe Pearson, 19, is \"very, very relieved\". Although she didn't get the two As and a B needed to get into Leeds, her two As and a C will guarantee her a place to do medicine at Sheffield. She wants to be a doctor because, she says, she has quite a lot of experience of the profession. Zoe suffers from Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, a chronic pain disorder that causes pain and spasms. She is a wheelchair user. </p> <p>\"I have regular operations at a hospital in Sheffield and am on quite a lot of drugs to keep the pain under control,\" she explained. During her studies she's worked in a pharmacy and a GP's surgery, volunteered at a medical centre and ran a support group for young people who share her condition. </p> <p>Today, at New College in Nottingham, where she took her A-levels, she described the atmosphere as \"very nervous and excited\". But there's a great deal of pride too. \"My college is fantastic, they've been really, really supportive. I'd definitely choose to come here again.\"</p> <p>Soleiman Aria, 20, barely spoke a word of English when he first arrived in this country in 2001. Today he said it was a \"dream come true\" to have been offered a place at Cambridge. After achieving two As in chemistry and maths and two Bs in biology and physics, he is now heading to the ivory towers of King's College, to study medicine.</p> <p>\"I never thought this day would come. There are no words to describe how I feel today,\" he said. Soleiman, the eldest of four children, fled his country three years ago, leaving his family behind in Kabul. </p> <p>\"I did not speak much English when I first came here and I was living alone with no family support, but I thought I have nothing to lose and so I will give it a go,\" he added. </p> <p>\"Brilliant\" was how 18-year-old Marie Cawley described achieving her three As at A-level. And \"brilliant\" is how the Stoke on Trent College student describes the medical course she is going to study at Keele University. \"They have a lot of clinical attachments and they do problem-based learning. I did half an hour there on the open day and I couldn't believe how much I learned. I love their kind of learning.\"</p> <p>Marie has spent a lot of time in hospital since she was a child, having been born with a dislocated hip. \"The atmosphere that the doctors and nurses create around you is brilliant. They've got a lot of time for you and I want to pay that back,\" she said.</p> <p>Richard Killip, 18, from Bradford College is celebrating three As and a C today. He's also celebrating being the first person in his family to get A-levels. Today's results have given him a place at Cambridge to study rural economies and environment studies. No one at his college remembers there being a successful application to Oxbridge before.</p> <p>Speaking form the pub, he said he was \"ecstatic\". </p> <p>\"I come from a working class background. I do think it has become more accessible anyway for more people to go to more universities; that's got a lot to do with it. But I couldn't tell you what the reason is for me doing this without sounding big headed.\"</p> <p>Raymond Catterill, from Leeds, left his strict Catholic school at 15 with no qualifications in 1950. Now aged 68 he's got his English A-level from Cross Keys Learning Centre in Leeds. Last year he passed an A-level in English literature. </p> <p>He said: \"I left school at 15.

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday August 21 2004</b> <br>  Contrary to what we said in the article below, neither the children's playground in Kensington Gardens nor the memorial water feature were projects of the Diana trust fund, The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. Both were projects of the official Diana memorial committee. The Fund, an entirely separate concern, has made a net profit of \u00a335m from its commercial licensing activities, plus some \u00a345m from sales of other products. It has so far committed \u00a350m to humanitarian initiatives around the world. <p>The mayor of London's latest promise that his subject householders will gladly fund the Olympics, yes even if we have to beggar ourselves for the privilege, was not well timed. Not - although this cannot have helped - because it coincided with the publication of photographs showing row upon row of empty plastic seats. That dearth of Athenian bums can easily be blamed on the Greeks. Why didn't the idiots make the stadia smaller? Or do whatever it was the Australians did to make those Sydney Games so magical?</p> <p>Like distant summers, the Olympics are apt to be more glorious in retrospect. They are most glorious of all when semi-mythical, like the classical games that inspired Baron Coubertin. In reality, as we are reminded on the dedicated sports dustbin that is BBC2, the Olympics are, for the most part, a strangely clumsy, soporific succession of obscure activities in which the important prizes are, plainly, not medals but an end to obscurity: global sponsorship, or failing that, the chance to see your arse anatomised in the pages of the Sun.</p> <p>And these are the highlights. The best thing about the television coverage is that it makes you glad that you aren't actually there, denied a close-up comparison of, say, the Korean, versus the American expression of despair and the invaluable BBC commentary, eg, \"He doesn't look very happy about that.\" Thus, the worst time for someone like the mayor of London to extol on the glamour and honour of staging the 2012 Olympics - at an estimated cost of \u00a33bn - is when they are actually unfolding. They might be unfolding anywhere.</p> <p>And at this dismal time, the absolutely worst moment to offer unlimited bounty for the creation of future Olympic ruins is when everyone has just watched the men's synchronised diving. We must be grateful that the BBC's coverage on Monday was transmitted after the watershed, limiting the number of vulnerable children who might, otherwise, have witnessed this complicated version of swimming- pool dive-bombing, and chosen it as a career. Which, thanks to lottery funding, is now possible. Imagine hearing your child say: \"Mummy, when I grow up I want to be a synchronised diver.\" The years of jumping in and getting out again. In unison. Even if they won. It is every parent's worst nightmare.</p> <p>And yet the mayor so longs for synchronised diving to come to London that he will fine every council tax payer for the opportunity. Why does he want the Olympics? What, given that Mr Livingstone himself obviously has little to gain from performing centre-stage at this international event, can be his motivation? He is not, so far as one can tell, much of a sportsman. But once, when he lived simply, among newts, Livingstone was known to be a great moralist. Maybe, at heart, he still is. Maybe, like Coubertin, whose \"grand and salutory task\" of Olympic revival emerged after visiting English public schools and American universities, Livingstone thinks they would make us pure in heart.</p> <p>In principle, this is not an unattractive idea. If they can be purged of the drugging and mysterious accidents on motorbikes; the corruption; the courtship of sponsors; the bankrupting of already shabby cities; the deaths, without compensation, of builders pressed to complete stadia on time; the standing invitation to terrorists; the rich opportunities for the exhibitionist tyrant, and for Mr Blair; the instant obsolescence of tons of plastic and concrete and the fabulous mawk and tawdriness now inherent in the enterprise, there is every reason why the modern Olympics could, as Coubertin intended, \"adhere to an ideal of a higher life\".</p> <p>We can only speculate on the place synchronised diving might have occupied in the baron's moral universe. Like many of the newer Olympic sports, it was presumably introduced for the sake of variety, introducing a novel twist to the rather tired sport of solitary diving (an activity which does, on the other hand, feature the ever-popular compensation of near-nudity). This might have been accomplished by getting the divers to perform hobbled, or in lead boots, or in chains and a straitjacket. But synchronicity has history on its side, having been introduced to swimming as long ago as 1984, and the advantage that, when things get tedious, the organisers can simply add more boards, more performers, maybe even some music.</p> <p>The chance to build structures in which visiting divers and handballers and beach-volleyball players can demonstrate their skills has been described by Livingstone as \"a massive prize\". Why? The government says the games \"will mobilise enthusiasm for sport\". Although not, one hopes, for any sport which requires a playing field, the government recently having disposed of 200 of them.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a very promising turn called Richard Caborn, apparently a sports minister, described these patches of grass as \"soggy playing fields\", and explained that today young people prefer modern \"state-of-the- art facilities\" in which to pursue their new, non-soggy sports. Such as synchronised diving, a sport so strictly, brazenly state of the art that it makes the hop, skip and jump look useful.</p> <p><b>The Diana Trust should have a head for figures</b></p> <p>The year after Princess Diana died, the trustees of her memorial fund were appalled when the Franklin Mint, purveyor of ornaments, produced a figurine of the princess in her landmine-inspecting outfit. Its lawyers' lawsuit accused the company of terrible things: \"Like vultures feeding on the dead, defendants are profiting from the death...\" </p> <p>Since when, the trust has lost both its action and millions of pounds in legal fees. Franklin Mint has filed a malicious prosecution claim which could cost it millions more. It appears that the company had every right to make Diana dolls and even those who do not covet a Franklin Mint collectable might wonder why the trust was so affronted. It was not as if they had their own range of dolls to sell. Or that Diana was the first royal spouse thus commemorated. When Prince Albert died, also young, in 1861, his widow, Queen Victoria, did not suppress the production in Staffordshire of memorial figurines, pot lids, urns, etc. She had her own monuments to build. </p> <p>As for the trust: its physical tributes to Diana amount to a children's playground - delightful, but inaccessible to non-parents, and one water-feature, also in Kensington, now indefinitely sealed off. Some grants to good causes have been suspended. Meanwhile, the Franklin Mint has been busy producing an inventive range of Diana novelties, from its Diana teapot and Princess Diana purse and accessories (currently reduced from $55 to $41.25), to Sheer Enchantment, a doll featuring the seated princess - \"a miniature recreation of the armchair is included to support her unique pose\". </p> <p>From a good taste point of view, this is obviously distressing. From any other angle, it is not. Presumably, since they can hardly be buying for investment, those who buy the mint's mini Dianas do so because they admire, miss, or venerate the late princess. If the trust has suffered financial difficulties, despite having raised \u00a356m from public donations and Elton John royalties, it should perhaps consider restoring its funds with a few, officially endorsed dollies of its own, non-vulture manufacture. Or, if this is too daunting a volte face for the fund's curious assortment of trustees, there remains the option of mass resignation. They have surely done enough.</p> <p><b>All work and no play makes Blair a dull boy</b></p> <p>Dismaying it may be, but Mr Blair's friendship with Silvio Berlusconi is not, given their record of chumminess, all that surprising. More alarming, I think, is the Blairs' obvious, shared belief that holidays are not for your family or friends, but an opportunity, like any other, for procuring advancement, for scheming, for networking. To meet Berlusconi professionally is one thing; to exchange the company of your young children for that of this preposterous mountebank may suggest, to the more sentimental, a nature that is, if not actually deformed by power, now so remote from the normal priorities that the next time a Blair starts pronouncing on juggling or on the work-life balance, someone should bring a translator. We do not speak the same language.</p>",
  "Choice is the current policy buzzword: choice of schools for children, choice within the NHS, and choice of delivery for our meals on wheels. But as this week's Guardian/ICM poll showed, there is one area of public life where people would definitely like to see more choice: at work. <p>In April 2003, the government gave working parents with children under the age of six or disabled children under the age of 18 the right to request flexible working arrangements. The present arrangements are quite limited, with the burden on the employee to make the case for change, and no legal requirement for the employer to consent (although so far eight out of 10 applications have been accepted by employers). </p> <p>However, the need for work-life balance is important and relevant to those without small children. For example, there are nearly five million carers in the UK who would benefit from a more flexible approach to work. Those without family obligations also benefit from more leisure time; with more control over their own time workers are healthier, happier and more engaged citizens. </p> <p>Creating a more flexible work environment is not just an employee perk. Evidence shows that where companies offer more flexible arrangements for employees, the benefits are manifold: increased productivity, improved recruitment and retention, lower absenteeism. It allows for better planning and time management for both organisations and individuals - and where home working is an option, vastly reduced overheads. Several case studies have proved the case for business efficiency gains. </p> <p>BT saved \u00a352m in overheads by introducing home working. Retention has also improved, with 98% of female employees returning to work after maternity leave. Research by Cambridge's Judge Institute of Management also shows that quality of service improves when people have a better work-life balance. More choice seems to result in better employees. </p> <p>Under the umbrella of flexible working, there are myriad choices for both employers and employees: part-time hours, part-year contracts such as term-time and compressed hours (e.g. working full-time hours in a 4-day week); annual hours contracts; job share, home working, teleworking, core hours with flexi-time. </p> <p>Working flexibly is sometimes seen as a middle class privilege only suitable for certain professions. However, since flexible working is not constrained to shortened hours, some level of employee choice is possible in almost all industry sectors, without compromising business demands.</p> <p>In the retail sector, shops have weighted staffing to suit the business as well as employees with more workers at lunchtime than at the start of the day - which is generally quieter - allowing for essential activity such as the school run or a lie-in.</p> <p>In manufacturing industries, annual hours contracts can be used to match peaks and troughs of demand as well as create employee benefit. With such a breadth of choice available, both businesses and employees should be able to achieve happier and more productive working environments.</p> <p>My employer, the Social Market Foundation thinktank, has been able to put the policy into action, with staffing arrangements including four-day weeks, flexible work hours, and teleworking which allows employees live access to the office network regardless of whether they are in Croydon or the C\u00f4te d'Azur. </p> <p>According to a Personnel Today report, nearly two-thirds of UK organisations support proposals extending current flexible working legislation to other employers. However, the Confederation of British Industry has suggested that the government is \"getting carried away\" with the flexible working agenda</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.irsemploymentreview.com/\">IRS employment review</a> also suggests that the law, rather than a culture change, is driving the flexible work agenda; the primary motivation for offering family-friendly hours was the law in 93% of cases. (Interestingly, one of the drawbacks of the flexible working arrangements, identified by human resources managers in the same survey, is the resentment from non-parent co-workers.) </p> <p>The Department for Trade and Industry is strongly behind the policy, but is adopting a non-legislative approach. With the law only pertaining to a small minority of workers, a sea change is unlikely. The current legislation is set for review within two years, when hopefully the government will look to broaden the legislation. The \"right to request\" needs to be extended to more, if not all workers, if flexible working is to be a viable choice for most employees.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Jcassidy@smf.co.uk\">Jcassidy@smf.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jacqueline Cassidy is conference manager at the <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk\">Social Market Foundation</a> (and is based on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, southern France)</p>",

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday August 30 2004</strong> </p> <p> We said in the report below that Microsoft Office 97 was a replacement for Windows 95. We confused two pieces of software: Windows 95 is an operating system; Office 97 is a suite of word processing and other programs. </p> <p></p> <p>Insensitive computer programmers with little knowledge of geography have cost the giant Microsoft company hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business and led hapless company employees to be arrested by offended governments. </p> <p>The problem has damaged the company's reputation and the \"trust rating,\" which is seen as key to keeping the company competitive, has dropped, a senior Microsoft executive revealed yesterday at the International Geographers Conference in Glasgow. </p> <p>In a frank assessment of the company's problems in trying to be a global player without offending local sensibilities, Tom Edwards, its senior geopolitical strategist, said employees' lack of basic geography was to blame. </p> <p>The company has now launched geography classes for its staff to avoid further bloomers which have caused embarrassment and cost money on a grand scale. He said that as a geographer himself it was depressing that Americans had a reputation for being particularly unaware of the rest of the world. The annual National Geographic Survey had thrown up the sad fact that only 23 out of 56 young Americans knew the whereabouts of the Pacific Ocean. </p> <p>\"It is therefore no surprise that some of our employees, however bright they may, have only a hazy idea about the rest of the world,\" he said. \"The repercussions on us can be very serious.\" </p> <p>As an American company with a global reach, Microsoft had to try and foster trust for reliability of its software and not cause offence. </p> <p>He said in all cases the mistakes made were simply through ignorance but this was not how they were seen in the countries concerned. They were all seen as deliberate policy and so the offence taken was far greater as a result. </p> <p>Perhaps the best known, and one of the most expensive, errors was a colour-coded world map showing time zones, which showed the disputed Jammu-Kashmir region as not being in India - an offence under Indian law. The mistake led to the whole of the Windows 95 operating system being banned in the country, losing large sales. For its replacement, Microsoft, Office 97, Microsoft removed the colour coding and sold 100,000 copies in India. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said the decisions on what to do about disputes arising over Microsoft products was taken entirely on commercial grounds. </p> <p>For example when employees were arrested in Turkey because Kurdistan had been shown as a separate entity on maps of the country, a decision was taken to remove Kurdistan from all maps. </p> <p>\"Of course we offended Kurds by doing this but we had offended the Turks more and they were a much more important market for our products. It was a hard commercial decision, not political.\" </p> <p>One mistake that caused catastrophic offence was a game called Kakuto Chojin, a hand to hand fighting game. The fighting went on with rhythmic chanting in the background which in reviewing the game Mr Edwards noticed appeared to be Arabic. </p> <p>\"I checked with an Arabic speaker in the company who was also a Muslim about what the chant meant and it was from the Koran. He went ballistic. It was an incredible insult to Islam.\" He asked for the game to be withdrawn but it was issued against his advice in the United States in the belief that it would not be noticed. </p> <p>Three months later, the Saudi Arabian government made a formal protest. Microsoft withdrew the game worldwide. </p> <p>His investigations showed the Japanese, who had developed the game for Microsoft, had added the chant to the tape because they liked the sound of it without checking its origins. \"They were chastised and corrected,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said it was better to be honest and open about these mistakes. It was all part of rebuilding that vital trust in the product. </p> <p><strong>Expensive oversights</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A game called Age of Empires 2 offended the Saudi Arabian authorities because it showed victorious Muslim armies turning churches into mosques. The game was withdrawn from sale in the kingdom </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Korean government, objected because Microsoft software showed the national flag in reverse. The software had to be changed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Spanish version of Windows used the word Hembra - meaning \"woman\" in Spain - for choosing gender. But in some Central American republics, notably Nicaragua, the word is an insult meaning \"bitch\". The program was changed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Microsoft employees were questioned by police in China, where it is an offence to refer to Taiwan as a country or as seperate to the Republic of China. Now Taiwan is not referred to as a country and all software worldwide avoids the issue by referring to places as \"regions or districts\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Uruguay is a republic and proud if it but in Microsoft's Outlook in Uruguay, the company offended the government by describing Tuesday April 30 as the queen's birthday.</p>",
  "<p>The gap year: a glorious, uninterrupted 365 days for you to do with as you will; a chance to expand your horizons, both mental and physical; an opportunity not to have to sit any blessed exams for once; time for a welcome rest; a breather while you (re)consider your life choices; or just a case of paralysing indecision leading to total inactivity.</p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, a gap year has something to offer pretty much everyone. The only question is: if you take a gap year, what on earth are you going to do with it?</p> <p><strong>Nothing</strong></p> <p>It's always an option: simply take a year off and lie around for the entire time. However, doing nothing is really only a viable option for trainee gurus, who want to spend a year in deep meditation and contemplation, or for the offspring of millionaires whose parents are lenient to the point of insanity. Otherwise, it's a ridiculous plan.</p> <p>You won't have any money, none of your friends will be around, you'll feel as though your life has ground to a halt, and you'll be bored out of your mind. Also, while future employers are fully supportive of a gap year, they would still expect you to do more with your time than just watch Trisha. It's a bad idea. Let's move on.</p> <p><strong>Travel</strong></p> <p>This is more like it. There's many a lonely A-level reviser whose thoughts turn to exotic climes and palm-fringed beaches, and who can blame them? A gap year is the perfect - in fact, possibly the only, ever, in your whole life - chance for an uninterrupted year of travel. And, no, it's not just dossing about somewhere warm.</p> <p>\"Travelling really matures you,\" says Tim Lloyd, who travelled around south-east Asia and Australia in his gap year, before starting his degree in travel management at Brighton University. \"You really have to learn how to deal with people and learn to accept them as they are.\"</p> <p>Lloyd worked at the Royal Mail sorting office in order to finance his trip. \"I resigned myself to not having a life for a few months. I didn't go out, I didn't spend any money, I just worked loads of shifts to save up. I didn't mind because I knew there was such a big life experience at the end of the tunnel.\"</p> <p>One of the main appeals of travelling was the lack of constraints. \"I've always been quite independent,\" he says. \"I didn't want to be tied down to anything. I'd booked my ticket but that was it - and I ended up changing my itinerary a few times, too.\" Which isn't to say travel doesn't have its scary moments.</p> <p>\"I landed in Singapore on my own, age 18, with nowhere to stay. It's quite terrifying thinking back, but you deal with it.\" And, paradoxically, you need to be organised in order to be spontaneous. \"I thoroughly investigated the countries I wanted to go to and had all my jabs. You just have to be clued-up so you can enjoy yourself.\"</p> <p><strong>Work here</strong></p> <p>If, on the other hand, you have no urgent desire to leave the country, why not just get a job? You'll be more flush than you've ever felt before and could save up enough to significantly smooth your transition to student life in a year's time. And it could lead you in undreamt-of directions.</p> <p>That's what happened to Geoffrey Wells, who is studying nursing at Kingston University. \"After my A-levels I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was sick of academic work and I decided to take a gap year. I wasn't even sure that I'd go to college at the end of it. My only motivation at that time was to get some money for a car, and through I neighbour I found out about a job in a care home. I had an informal interview and started working in a day centre for elderly people with dementia or Alzheimer's.\"</p> <p>He found he liked the work. \"It was challenging because most of them were at the stage where they knew something was wrong with them, but couldn't quite work out what.\" Soon, he started considering nursing as a career. \"I decided I wanted a qualification of some sort. My mum's a nurse and she suggested it, as what I was doing was already a form of nursing.\"</p> <p>Wells believes his gap year was valuable. \"It gave me a break and time to think,\" he says. \"If I'd rushed on to college I might have ended up doing something I didn't want to do. I carried on working at the day centre while I was studying, so it's been really useful financially, as well as in terms of experience that I can apply to my nursing.\"</p> <p><strong>Work abroad</strong></p> <p>Finding employment in another country is a good way to travel without parting with too much cash (just don't expect to bring any extra home with you). Because of different visa restrictions around the world, you can't just turn up in the country of your choice and get a job; research is vital. There are also agencies that will help you.</p> <p>Harriet Griffiths has just graduated from Warwick University with a degree in maths. Before she started, she spent a year working in Canada, which she arranged through Bunac. \"I could not have done it without them,\" she says. \"You need a sponsor in order to get a visa, so they do that. They don't find you a job, but they give lots of job-seeking support. And they sort out things like a social security number and a bank account - things you don't really think about before you arrive.\"</p> <p>Because she's a keen skier, Griffiths headed to Banff, in the Rockies, at the start of the ski season. She found work in a hotel. \"Making beds and cleaning toilets wasn't the best job in the world but everyone working in the hotel was there for the same reasons as me, so we had a really good time. The hotel provided cheap accommodation for us, too, so it was a bit like living in student halls, only without the lectures.\"</p> <p>Having to work did not spoil her year out - \"because the rest of the time I was having fun. I was skiing two or three times a week, and it has a real small-town atmosphere, so I could always find someone to go out with. Being in one place for so long meant I got to know it inside out.\"</p> <p>But, she adds, a year out does have some disadvantages. \"You do have to work hard in your first term at college to pick up your subject again and get back into working,\" she says. \"But the benefits far outweigh the problems. I'm more confident in myself. It seems like some people who don't take a gap year go into that machine of school, university, work. I feel like I've seen a bit of the world and it's given me a better outlook on it.\"</p> <p><strong>Volunteer</strong></p> <p>If you're of an altruistic frame of mind, you could consider volunteering, either here or abroad. Charlotte Nock, who is about to start a degree in law with French law at the University of Kent, spent four months in the south Pacific country of Vanuatu - \"50 different islands, near Fiji\" - working in a school, as part of a project organised by GAP.</p> <p>\"It was definitely the place that appealed to me,\" she says. \"It was the other side of the world ... It was different in every way: the people, environment, the landscape. And it was totally idyllic: I lived a few metres away from the bay, and I swam with turtles every day.\" The work was also enjoyable. \"I taught English, French, social science and RE. It was a challenge, especially the RE because it's a country with very strong religious beliefs. I started to really love it. The children responded in a fantastic way and I developed great friendships based round the school.\"</p> <p>Living in a small community with barely any other westerners didn't faze her. \"I totally integrated and I surprised myself by not getting homesick really, apart from a couple of days when I was ill. I do think you need a certain kind of personality to adapt to it. You need to be willing to fit in.\"</p> <p><strong>The unexpected gap year</strong></p> <p>It's all very well if you've been planning your gap year for months, and have read every guide book, scoured every website and digested every scrap of advice you can lay your hands on. But what if your gap year is more thrust upon you than chosen, as a result of disappointing A-level results, perhaps, or a sudden change of heart about your chosen course or college?</p> <p>Remember, you don't have to take a gap year; Clearing is there to smooth your transition into an immediate university career, should you so desire. However, you may decide that some time out is what you need, especially if you're feeling academically shaken.</p> <p>One way to spend your year is to do resits, if you think you need to, or dedicate yourself to reapplying to universities you think will really suit you. On the other hand, perhaps you just want to get the hell out of town. Is it too late?

  "<p>Coca-Cola's multimillion-pound sponsorship of the Football League has upset fans in Cambridge - after the soft drinks giant got the local club colours wrong on its advertising billboards.</p> <p>When Coca-Cola announced its three-year sponsorship deal, reportedly worth \u00a315m, earlier this year, a central part of its marketing strategy was changing its famous red and white logo into the colours of all 72 teams in the Football League on giant billboards and posters in each home ground.</p> <p>\"Plymouth supporters will see green and white Coca-Cola perimeter board branding at Home Park,\" Coca-Cola said. \"The logo turns claret and blue at West Ham, black and orange at Hull City, blue and white at Peterborough and black and white at Darlington.\"</p> <p>But when Cambridge United, currently in tenth place in the renamed Coca-Cola League 2, received its perimeter boards for its home ground it found that the colours were wrong.</p> <p>A print advertisement featuring the Coca-Cola logo in club colours for publication in the match day programme was also wrong.</p> <p>Mark Johnson, Cambridge United media co-ordinator, said the club submitted its correct amber and black club colours when the billboard were being organised by the Football League and its advertising representatives.</p> <p>\"When they came back they were a wishy-washy yellow and white,\" Mr Johnson said. \"They didn't look very good and it wasn't our club colours.\"</p> <p>Cambridge United secretary Andrew Pincher said the perimeter boards looked so bad it was impossible to read the Coca-Cola logo from across the football pitch.</p> <p>One Cambridge fan said Coca-Cola's attempt to tap into the fans' loyalty to their clubs had \"spectacularly misfired\". </p> <p>\"There is even a club song called amber and black,\" he said, describing the incident as an \"own goal for Coca-Cola's marketing team\".</p> <p>A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said she had no knowledge of the error at Cambridge United but that the company had checked the colours thoroughly before the billboards were erected: \"These colours are the ones that the clubs have given us.\"</p> <p>\"We have not had any complaints from anyone saying that's not right,\" she added.</p> <p>But Cambridge United said that after they complained the print advertisements were quickly replaced with the correct colours. But the large billboards were not changed.</p> <p>The campaign is the first time Coca-Cola has changed its famous red and white colours. The campaign extended to an animated sequence in the massive Coca-Cola billboard at Piccadilly Circus in London.</p> <p>Coca-Cola is also selling special packs of cans in club colours in local shops.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's position as the dominant force in British television production is likely to be diluted as a result of pressure on it to take a scythe to its sprawling structure. </p> <p>The BBC is by far the biggest programme-maker in Britain, employing almost 20,000 people in production-related jobs. Critics say it is too big. </p> <p>Independent producers have long believed the size of the BBC's production division puts them at a disadvantage because commissioning executives are under pressure to keep in-house staff occupied, despite a legal obligation on the corporation to source a certain number of shows from outside. </p> <p>Relations between the BBC and the \"indies\", as they are known, deteriorated under the previous director-general, Greg Dyke, who said it was not his job to make them rich. Mr Dyke was derisive of the demands of independent producers, some of whom - including ex-BBC staff such as Big Brother guru Peter Bazalgette - became millionaires when selling their companies on. </p> <p>Independent productions for the BBC include: Spooks (Kudos); Have I Got News for You (Hat Trick); Friday Night with Jonathan Ross (Open Mike); and Restoration and Fame Academy (Endemol). </p> <p>Fences have been mended between the corporation and the indies with a deal on new terms of trade, and the indies are now arguing for the BBC to spend much more externally, commissioning shows on merit , not through the need to keep BBC employees in jobs. </p> <p>At the moment, the BBC is obliged to commission 25% of its programmes from outside, although certain genres, such as news, are exempt. The BBC said last week it had commissioned more than 2,300 hours from independents in 2003-04. </p> <p>Jana Bennett, the BBC's director of television, said: \"I am committed to staying well above the quota in this current year and in the years to come.\" </p> <p>Pact, the trade body for more than 600 indies, wants the BBC's in-house productions limited to 50% of output, with 25% reserved for indies and the rest open to all. This would favour producers outside the BBC who do not qualify in law as indies, such as Granada, the programme-making arm of ITV. Pact also wants the quotas measured by programme cost, as well as length. </p> <p>Such a shift in power would inevitably lead to significant job losses at the BBC, although many of these people would probably set up their stall in the expanding indie sector. There are fears in the BBC of a bloodbath; independent producers say it would be more akin to a blood transfusion. </p> <p>It appears the indies are knocking at an open door: one of the first acts of Mark Thompson when he took up his post as director general in June was to commission a review of the BBC's commissioning and production structure. Although he was at pains to say he had an \"open mind\", few believe he would have ordered the review had he believed the system was sound. </p> <p>Mr Thompson hinted in a speech on his first day that the coming months would bring significant changes to the BBC's structure. \"A BBC which is big in terms of services is essential. But how deep should the BBC be? How big, in other words, in terms of vertical integration, of departments, in-house operations and commercial subsidiaries? ... We face a much tougher financial environment going forward - and some testing questions about our size and shape as an organisation.\" </p> <p>John McVay, the chief executive of Pact, said he is arguing for a \"level playing field\" and for programmes to be commissioned on merit, regardless of who made them. \"The only way the BBC is going to survive in future is by making the best programmes,\" he said. </p> <p>The BBC's review is likely to be completed this autumn, before the green paper on the renewal of its royal charter.</p>",
  "Britain should expect more dangerous flash floods, catastrophic rain and hail storms, droughts and heatwaves from the rapid changes in rainfall patterns brought by global warming, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said yesterday as clean-up operations continued in flooded Boscastle. <p>The Prince of Wales interrupted a Scottish holiday to fly to the Cornish village to offer financial help and praise the emergency services </p> <p>Fifty-seven people, many thought to be elderly, were airlifted to safety in central Scotland last night after becoming trapped in their vehicles by landslides after torrential rainstorms. </p> <p>Three rescue helicopters were scrambled after about 20 vehicles,were stranded between two landslips in the Lochearnhead area, north of Stirling. No-one was believed to be in immediate danger. </p> <p>The average number of European climate-related disasters has doubled in 10 years and two out of three of the \"catastrophic\" events since 1980 are now directly attributed to floods, storms, droughts or heatwaves, the EEA said. </p> <p>David Viner of the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit, one of the report's authors, said: \"Heavy rainfall patterns are changing. </p> <p>\"We are moving towards more intense rainfall. Drier summers are being punctuated by particularly intense incidents such as we have just seen in Cornwall.\" </p> <p>The agency says Europe is warming faster than the global average. </p> <p>The temperature has risen by an average of 0.95C in the past 100 years and is projected to climb by a further 2.0-6.3C this century as the emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise. </p> <p>The concentration of CO 2 , the main greenhouse gas, is at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34% above its level before the industrial revolution, the report says. </p> <p>The agency singles out summer floods in Europe two years ago and last year's summer heatwave in western and southern Europe as examples of how destructive climate change can be. </p> <p>More than 20,000 deaths were recorded during the heatwave and the flooding affected more than 600,000 people and caused economic losses of at least \u20ac15bn (\u00a310bn) </p> <p>It says that wetter conditions in northern Europe and drier weather in the south could threaten agriculture and completely melt three quarters of the glaciers in the Swiss Alps by 2050. </p> <p>Cold winters could disappear almost entirely and hot summers, droughts and incidents of heavy rain or hail could become much more frequent, it adds. </p> <p>But it says that the annual growing season for plants lengthened by an average of 10 days between 1975 and 1995, and is projected to continue getting longer. </p> <p>\"The consequences of climate change are a very real and dangerous threat, yet international leaders seem to pay lit tle heed to the warning bells,\" Mike Childs, of Friends of the Earth, said. \"We need decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\" </p> <p>Jacqueline McGlade, director of the agency, said: \"Climate change is already happening and having widespread impacts, many of them with substantial economic costs, on people and ecosystems across Europe. </p> <p>\"This is a phenomenon that will considerably affect our societies and environments for decades and centuries to come.\"</p>",
  "<p>Why are childcare horror stories always limited to toddlers? The hidden camera film of bullying staff in the recent BBC documentary Nurseries Undercover was harrowing. But childcare extends beyond the age of four. If a hidden camera followed a group of teenagers around, the results would be even worse. </p> <p>This summer holiday, the Daycare Trust warned that there was a serious shortage of provision for teenagers. While parents will ensure their children under 13 have structured activities and childcare this summer, few will do the same for older children. How many parents know what their teenagers are doing this summer? </p> <p>It's tough to be an adolescent, but so much tougher to be the parent of one. A report last month found that six out of 10 parents believe it's harder for them to bring up their teenagers than it was for their own parents. Of course, this is subjective rather than scientific data, but few would argue that parenting adolescents has got any easier. </p> <p>Last month's Family Report 2004 by the Institute of Public Policy Research found that parents are anxious that they can't afford to buy the things their teenagers want. They also worry about drugs, alcohol and crime. A generation ago the teenage years were deemed trying; today they are considered perilous. </p> <p>Newspapers scream about \"epidemics\" of pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and violence among young people. Teenagers are frequently depicted as ungovernable, and their parents are blamed. So far, the government has responded with antisocial behaviour orders, which are mostly targeted at teenagers, and by giving the police powers to break up small groups of teens who are repeatedly disruptive. </p> <p>Three-quarters of parents surveyed thought that the teenage years were the most difficult to deal with - worse than coping with a toddler. While both age groups are similar in their testing of boundaries and their temper tantrums, the former will usually say \"I love you\" afterwards - while a teenager may still refuse to be seen with you in public. Yet almost 70% of parents said that society was far more supportive of parents with younger children than of those with teenagers. </p> <p>Teenagers have always been attracted to adult rights without the accompanying responsibilities. But the internet and growth of television channels bombard teenagers with influences, aspirations and marketing messages that catapult them into the adult world far earlier than a generation ago. Much of this television and internet use occurs unsupervised. Working parents don't employ nannies for their 13-year-olds. When parents do get home they are often tired, and conversations focus on \"Have you done your homework?\" or \"Have you tidied your room?\" </p> <p>As the number of children living in lone-parent families increases, research shows that lone parents find it harder to deal with teenagers because they feel so unsupported. Many more families are reconstituted, providing the potential for a difficult step-parent dynamic. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Home Office says that drug use has increased, and starts earlier among teenagers. One in three 14-year-olds has taken drugs (mostly cannabis), rising to two out of five 16-year-olds. About 10% of 12-year-olds say they regularly have a drink, and by the age of 15 this rises to 30%. </p> <p>But some of the difficulties in parenting teenagers are more timeless in nature. These young people need to become independent of their parents. Their peer group inevitably has the greatest influence. At secondary school, parents don't compare parenting problems outside the school gates. With no yardstick against which to measure how they're doing, parents may be too liberal, afraid of alienating their child by setting boundaries. Many studies have shown that the best parenting for teenagers combines open communication, negotiation, warmth and authority. </p> <p>In the UK, the government has spent millions of pounds on its Sure Start programme, which supports families of young children, particularly those in poverty. It is families with exactly the same economic profile that have the most problems with their teenagers. Sure Start is working well but, as the IPPR report notes, it needs to be extended. Instead of after-school clubs, teenagers need youth and sporting centres. </p> <p>A quarter of parents with children under six have asked employers to let them work flexibly since the new law allowed them to do so in April 2002. But many parents with teenagers also need that flexibility. Parents also need to talk to and support each other, and secondary schools could facilitate this by holding parenting groups. The most vulnerable parents need parenting classes, but all parents need to reclaim their teenagers - not to ignore them because they don't seem to want them, or to give them more freedom than they think is safe, or more money than they can afford. </p> <p>There are signs the government is taking more interest in teenagers and may help parents to help themselves. Its five-year education strategy - which will include a green paper on youth - also reintroduces school uniforms, relieving an economic pressure on parents to help their teenagers compete with each other, and making it harder for children to play truant. </p> <p>Alongside any government initiatives, parents themselves need to show to their own teenagers that they're available for them. A poll in the United States by the YMCA found that, while parents cite the fear of drugs as their main concern, teenagers listed not having enough time with their parents. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Luisa Dillner is head of BMJ Learning at the British Medical Journal </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ldillner@bmj.com\">ldillner@bmj.com</a></p>"
