  "<p>Big Food Group confirmed it has received a \u00a3380m bid from the Icelandic investor Baugur, owner of toy retailer Hamleys. </p> <p>The Iceland frozen food and Booker cash and carry operation was forced to admit the approach following a report in yesterday's Guardian. </p> <p>Its shares rose 10.5p to 102.75p, continuing the rise from below 90p which began on Thursday. </p> <p>The \"preliminary\" talks with Baugur value each share at 110p, but the company said the Icelandic financiers had reserved the right to clinch a deal at a lower price after due diligence. </p> <p>The approach from Baugur, which owns 22% of Big Food, forced the company to admit that its trading had deteriorated of late. </p> <p>Bill Grimsey, the chief executive of Big Food, said the trading environment was \"difficult\". </p> <p>Big Food had said in July that trading was tough. \"Since then, weather conditions have been generally worse than last year, impacting the performance of a number of retailers,\" the company said. </p> <p>\"The environment has also continued to be challenging in the light of consolidation in the grocery market and increasing price competition, which is expected to continue.\" </p> <p>The group's comparative sales in the 10 weeks to September 10 were down 3.2%, worse than the 1.7% fall for the longer 23-week period to Sep tember 10. At Iceland the fall in the 10 weeks was 3.8% - more than the 2.6% in the longer period. </p> <p>At Booker sales were down 4.1% in the 10-week period compared with a 2.4% fall for the 23 weeks. </p> <p>The company, which is due to report its profits for the half year in November, said cost control and margin protection had helped to \"mitigate\" the slower sales. </p> <p>City sources said it was by no means certain that a deal would be clinched by Baugur, which this week sold its stake in department store House of Fraser. The Icelandic financier also owns women's clothing chains Oasis and Karen Millen and jeweller Goldsmiths, and was thought to be interested in buying Hobbs. </p> <p>Mr Grimsey admitted that the approach from Baugur might help to flush out other bidders but revealed that he thought it was likely the board would recommend the Icelandic offer if a deal could be arranged. </p> <p>Analysts were doubtful about whether a deal could be agreed. They pointed to the \u00a3100m deficit in the pension fund and \u00a3260m debt. </p> <p>The company was formed through the merger of Iceland and Booker, which was run by Stuart Rose, the present chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p>Share-dealing after the deal was clinched, by Malcolm Walker - who was chairman of Iceland - has been referred to the Serious Fraud Office.</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian's second social audit, in which it tests its own behaviour as an organisation against the demands it makes of others, is published this week at a time when the paper is engaged in what may prove to be the most momentous changes in its history.</p> <p>The chief executive of the company and the editors of the Guardian and the Observer, in a joint introduction to the audit, refer to the present situation as a \"crossroads\". It is one from which the Guardian will go forward in a new format with its journalistic values essentially reinforced. The audit gives the fullest account the paper has offered so far of the thinking behind the \"critical decision\" to change to the so-called Berliner or midi format. </p> <p>Trust is a recurring theme. Publication of the social, ethical and environmental audit itself represents an unusual act of trust in the context of an industry that in general is not highly trusted. The report points out that a Mori poll of 2,000 adults from earlier this year found that although trust in journalists had risen slightly to 20% they were still considered the least trustworthy of any group, including politicians. Against this, the audit reveals that in a poll of 2,500 readers and web users carried out in June this year 93% said they trusted the Guardian's editorial coverage (with the figures for the Observer and Guardian Unlimited 87% and 89% respectively). </p> <p>The social audit suggests reasons for this in the degree of frank revelation it offers - unique among UK media organisations - and the involvement that it invites. There can be few media organisations anywhere that let you in so far and then tell you so much about themselves, including their identified faults. The independent auditor, whose job it is to report on the reliability of the inquiry said the Guardian was \"not only providing a beacon for British media companies but setting standards in disclosure for the whole corporate sector\". </p> <p>The audit, which in fact, covers the whole of GNL - comprising the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Unlimited - shows that to a remarkable degree the Guardian does practise what it preaches and that where it does not it is actively trying to do something about it: to close the gap between the aim and the actuality. It will be picked over for signs of complacency but its tone, I suggest, is pretty rigorous and invigorating. </p> <p>The report examines: the paper's relationship with its readers and the way it responds to their queries and complaints (a survey of Guardian readers showed that 59% of you are now aware of the existence of the readers' editor); its relationship with its suppliers, who are expected to have social policies compatible with the Guardian's; and it considers the views of its staff, including their caveats about pay and conditions. Asked in 2003 whether they thought pay and conditions were fair across the whole of GNL only 15% agreed with the proposition that they were (48% thought they were not). However, asked in the same survey to respond to the statement \"I am proud to work at GNL\", 86% agreed that they were. The intention is to conduct these staff surveys every two years. </p> <p>The audit pays particular attention to the paper's record on the environment. It says, \"We pride ourselves on our environmental coverage and put more resources into this area than any other national newspaper.\" When professionals working for environment agencies were asked which of the UK quality newspapers provided the most authoritative coverage in this area 76% of them nominated the Guardian (none at all said the Times or the Daily Telegraph). </p> <p>However, the audit concedes, \"It is only in the past year that we as a company have started to consistently heed our own advice. We have now formulated a comprehensive environmental policy covering procurement, energy, water and waste management with a commitment to continuous improvement.\" Recycled paper now accounts for 75% of newsprint used by the Guardian and Observer - 93% of Guardian readers recycle their paper. </p> <p>The spirit of the Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian, permeates the report. The paper - in the words of CP Scott, quoted in the report by the trust's present chair - has \"a moral as well as a material existence\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The social audit is online at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/socialaudit\">theguardian.com/socialaudit</a> Readers can request a copy by emailing their address to <a href=\"mailto:socialaudit@theguardian.com\">socialaudit@theguardian.com</a> or by writing to Jo Confino, The Guardian, 75 Farringdon Road, London EC1M 3JY.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning <strong>0845 451 9589</strong> (UK only, calls charged at local rate) or <strong>+44 (0)20 7713 4736</strong> between 11am and 5pm UK time Monday to Friday excluding UK bank holidays.<br> <strong>Mail</strong> to Readers' editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, UK.<br><strong> Fax</strong> +44 (0)20 7239 9997.<br><a href=\"mailto:reader@theguardian.com\">reader@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p> <strong>1.09pm</strong> Afternoon all, and can I just say how glad I am to b... ach! What am I saying? I'm hung over, and there's an end on't. Golf kicks off in a minute, and if anyone would like to suggest a soothing picture - bearing in mind I shall ignore anything with the phrase 'The O.C.' in it - email away.</p> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> Garcia and Westwood are taking on DiMarco and Haas in the day's first four-ball match, and already your emails are flooding in. Erm, hang on, they aren't doing anything of the sort. Fix up, please. The Europeans have rather fetching white caps: if anyone knows where I can get hold on one - NB to European golf PRs - you know what to do.</p> <p><strong>1.17pm</strong> All four players leather their tee shots safely down the fairway, and set off in hot, or at least tepid, pursuit. I'm more interested in the adverts for Gillette's new battery-powered razors. Some would say that with a rather pikey rash of gingery hair adorning the lower segment of my face, I might be well advised to get my hands on one. Pah - I defy the detractors.</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Lee Westwood's second shot lands near the pin, but the ball dribbles away down the green's camber. Haas does likewise. Several rednecks whoop.</p> <p><strong>1.27pm</strong> \"The only reason for watching golf,\" remarks Oliver Morgan, \"is to hope that someone in the crowd calls Colin Montgomerie a fat Scottish cuckold, which he is.\" Hardly charitable, but both funny and true; moreover the only contribution so far, and thus worthy of inclusion. Jay Haas birdies the first hole with a fantastic putt, to put the Americans one up. Ian 'Donald, Where's Me Troosers' Poulter pulls his tee shot well left, as does Darren Clarke. Cue more redneck yelps.</p> <p><strong>1.29pm</strong> Riley lands in the bunker, but Tiger Woods creams his drive delightfully down the fairway. Cue even more rednec.. etc.</p> <p><strong>1.34pm</strong> \"My internet link is costing me $20\", says David Keech, \"so your commentary had better be good!\" David is obviously unfamiliar with my work. In case you're joining late, the Seppos are one up thanks to Jay Haas in the first group; the second lot - with the exception of Tiger Woods - are busy making a frightful meal of the first hole. I am hung over, Monty has already been abused by one of our correspondents, and that, by my estimation, means that all is well with the world.</p> <p><strong>1.39pm</strong> Ian Poulter, whose hair I am considering copying to set off my fiery beard, recovers from a dodgy tee shot to find a good position on the green. On the second hole, Lee Westwood overshoots the pin and the ball runs away down the back of the green.</p> <p><strong>1.43pm</strong> Tiger Woods misses his birdie putt by <em>this</em> much. No, <em><strong>this</strong></em> much. The Eurorookies tee off in the third match, with David Howell and Paul Casey both finding the middle of the fairway safely.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Chad Campbell looks like the lad who did the truffle shuffle in a film I watched when I was young. It was either The Goonies or The Lost Boys. Someone help me out...? Anyway, he lands his drive in the rough. Meanwhile, the Americans are one up in both of the first two matches.</p> <p><strong>1.47pm</strong> Lee Westwood guffs the chance of a four-foot putt to win the par-five second. The useless little beggar.</p> <p> <strong>1.51pm</strong> David Howell and Paul Casey are playing exceptionally well on the first hole, as indeed they need to. Eurpoe's final pair - Monty and Paddy Harrington - are delivered to the first tee in a rather lovely looking buggy.</p> <p><strong>1.57pm</strong> \"Has the axis of evil, Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld, arrived to cheer on their fellow Republicans against Old Europe?\" wonders Rob Hisnay, whose surname I swear is a staple of Snoop Dogg's peculiar vocabulary. Erm, I haven't spotted them, although if it was America v Afghanistan, I'm sure they'd be hanging around the 18th for an impromptu invasio.. actually that's a dreadful gag, isn't it? It's all square in the third group at the first, by the way.</p> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> \"I really, really hope you are the guy I went to college with,\" says Jack Thorne. Oh dear, a blast from the shameful past. \"If so you'll remember what you did to Vanessa's face.\" This really isn't as bad as it sounds. Or at least not as bad as it might have been. Erm, erm... Haas, on the fourth, plays a brave shot out of the rough, which shoots past the pin to leave him with a tough putt. Dimarco atones with a far better shot to within four feet.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> Jack again - this time without such an appalling allusion to my appalling past. \"For someone who clearly spent most of his life modelling himself on Ralph Mouth you really should know that the 'Truffle Shuffle' is from the Goonies,\" he says, directing us to <a href=\"www.coreyfeldman.com\">www.coreyfeldman.com</a>. \"The celebrity friends bit is the best bit of the site.\" He's not joking. \"The guy's a living legend.\" Oh, and there's golf on, too. Sergio Garcia putts for birdie, but misses. </p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Darren Clarke birdies to haul the Americans back to one in front after three. Marcus Thorpe, meanwhile, has a treat in store for us: a rather fetching picture of Chunk, engaged in the famous Truffle Shuffle. Watch this space. Or that one on the right, anyway.</p> <p><strong>2.19pm</strong> Furyk and Campbell are all square with Casey and Howell after they halve second, while Colin Montgomerie and Padraig Harrington are one down after the first. I'd tell you more, but I'm busy cropping the Truffle Shuffle picture. Let's be honest, that's what you came here for. Bear with me...</p> <p><strong>2.26pm</strong> Colin Montgomerie is on the second, shading his eyes from the early Detroit sunlight. And clobbering a golf ball down the fairway with consummate ease, naturally. The Americans are having very much the better of the first morning, with Tiger Woods is particular looking happy not to have Phil Mickelson lumbering around and spoiling his mojo.</p> <p><strong>2.31pm</strong> A cacophony of whooping greets a birdie by Jay Haas on the fifth hole, which puts the Americans one up.</p> <p><strong>2.35pm update:</strong> </p> <p>(1 up) DiMarco/Haas 5 Garcia/W'wood 5 <br> (1 up) Woods/Riley 4 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 3 Casey/Howell (all square)<br> (1 up) Cink/Love 2 Monty/Har'ton<br></p> <p><strong>2.42pm</strong> Davis Love III, in the bottom game, pays a lovely shot to within a couple of feet of the pin. Cink tries to do the same, but ends up overshooting. Padraig Harrington rescues things for Europe after Montie pulls his tee shot wide, but the pressure is firmly on the Europeans in all four of the games.</p> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong> Lee Westwood misses a fairly straightforward short putt on the sixth - America go two up, whilst Tiger Woods holes a beauty on the fifth - Aerica, once more, go two up. As my hangover drains of most of its early exuberance, I'm starting to feel horribly jaded. Entertain your poor correspondent, please.</p> <p><strong>2.51pm</strong> A lot of the players are having trouble with a tight entrance to the green on the third hole. Tiger Woods and Ian Poulter find the left and right bunkers respectively. The Americans, by the way, are wearing pink taffeta ball gowns and glitzy tiaras...</p> <p><strong>2.55pm</strong> ..of course they're not. They're wearing rather fetching red-and-black polo shirts and matching caps. But taffeta would be a lot more fun, eh? They're two up in both of the first two games, and good for it, too. Lee Westwood is fighting back, though, with a lovely approach shot on the seventh.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> Poulter makes a three on the sixth, but Woods is equal to it, and the Americans stay two ahead in the second game. \"What is the composition of the perfect fry-up?\" wonders Duncan Apple. \"I say three sausages (meaty, rather than of the saveloy/frankfurter school), two bacon, beans, two hash browns, one toast, and, [daringly, I think] a piece of good black pudding.\" Interesting, although not at all a bad thing, to see that Duncan disdains both eggs and mushrooms. If anyone wishes to debate this, now is your chance.</p> <p><strong>3.05pm</strong> Monty and Harrington go two down after four, with Monty fluffing his putt to put the pressure on Davis Love III. Bah! \"You could be doing minute-by-minute commentary of Man City-Crystal Palace instead of the Ryder Cup,\" expostulates Robert Hisnay, without making it clear whether this is a taunt or reassurance.</p> <p><strong>3.16pm</strong> Sorry for the brief interruption. I would blame technical troubles, but you'd all see straight through to the heart of the matter - my own woeful torpor. You've missed ... not a great deal. Europe are still playing miserably, losing holes to par (Monty and Harrington) and putting like duffers (Clarke and Poulter) I should imagine that Debbie Archer has heard the Radio 4 gags for most of her life. The poor girl. \"Whats the ugly chick off the Crankies got to do with golf?\" she asks, raising a smile, but missing the point of all this by several feet.</p> <p> <strong>3.19pm</strong> Two gorgeous shots from the Westwood and Garcia, to land within good distance of the pin on the par-three ninth. \"Before a playful subject gets miles off the rails,\" interjects Daniel Musgrave, with some venom, \"I feel I must interject with some venom.\" Go ahead... \"BEANS??? What good is a fry up with some hideous tinned tasteless slop drowning everything with its baby food features? Scrambled eggs heavy on butter, NO milk, and a crispy piece of fried bread (not pre-sliced white pap). Enough said.\" Right you are.</p> <p><strong>3.22pm</strong> Riley puts for par and halves the seventh to keep the Americans two shots in front. </p> <p><strong>3.26pm: Lazy min-by-min commentator decides to let a score-card do the talking, as rapidly diminishing audience heave sighs of relief to be rid of tedious twitterings for just a few minutes</strong><br> (1 up) DiMarco/Haas 8 Garcia/W'wood 5 <br> (2 up) Woods/Riley 7 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 6 Casey/Howell (1 up)<br> (2 up) Cink/Love 5 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>3.33pm</strong>The Woods/Riley v Clarke/Poulter match is heating up, with some good putting on both sides. They're on the eighth, with Clarke playing a decent escape shot from the bunker to run up to the pin. </p> <p><strong>3.39pm</strong> Good recovery shot from Garcia to get out of the rough and onto the green at the tenth. But attention is on Davis Love III, who sinks his fourth birdie of the morning to put the Americans three up in the last pair.</p> <p><strong>3.47pm</strong> \"I think it is possible to make up Motown sounding song titles using the names of the Ryder Cup players,\" says David O'Doherty. \"Riley, Haas Love Cink? (albeit a Japanese cover band song title)\" I won't pretend I have the faintest idea what this means. The second pairs halve the ninth, with the Americans two up.</p> <p><strong>3.51pm</strong> The first pairs halve the tenth, with the Americans still one up. Hal Sutton appears on the television to express his satisfaction with what he's watching, and to look a little bit like Simon Weston. \"Good luck with the hangover,\" says Elena Papazoglou, who has the best email address I've ever seen, \"I always find a can of pina colada from Marks and Spencers does the trick, then a nice snooze on the floor of the disabled loo at work!\"</p> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong> Finally Monty wins a hole - the seventh - for Europe. They're two down now, which is better than a welly in the clackers, and more pertinently, better than three down. My profuse thanks to Jason Reid, who has sent me not only two grand pictures, but this instructive passage. \"Grown men and women willingly poison themselves with glass after glass of alcohol in order to feel comfortable being themselves. Why suffer the hangover? There's no more disarming activity than golf, no better way to break down protective exteriors.\"</p> <p> <strong>4.07pm</strong> After the Americans dominated the front nine, Europe seem to be coming back into the match. Garcia putts well to win the eleventh, and square the first match.<br> DiMarco/Haas 11 Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> (2 up) Woods/Riley 10 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 8 Casey/Howell (1 up)<br> (2 up) Cink/Love 7 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>4.14pm</strong> After an age of jiggling around and shaking his posterior, Jim Furyk putts on the ninth and misses, handing the initiative to the Europeans. Haas, on the other hand absolutely clobbers the ball down the twelfth fairway, to put himself in with a decent chance to make eagle.</p> <p><strong>4.16pm</strong> Chad Campbell rescues the Americans after Furyk's miss to halve the ninth. Harrington, meanwhile knocks a fairly short putt home to halve the eighth. Monty and Paddy stay two down.</p> <p><strong>4.23pm</strong> Sergio Garcia birdies the twelfth. Then titters all round, as a group of squirrels scamper playfully around the ninth tee. If anyone can let me know the collective noun for squirrels, I'd feel a lot happier. In the meantime, I'm simply glad that this is on Sky, and not the BBC, whose paroxysms of delight at that sort of thing would probably have broken me. In addition to which, none of you televisually disadvantaged would be spending your Saturday in my company. </p> <p><strong>4.26pm</strong> Despite Haas' great chance to make eagle, he can't quite sink the four-foot putt required, and the first match moves on to the thirteenth hole all square.</p> <p><strong>4.32pm</strong> A fifteen-foot putt from Casey puts the Europeans two up after the tenth. The rookies are outclassing Furyk and Campbell.</p> <p><strong>4.34pm</strong> 'Wifey' informs me that the collective noun for squirrels is a dray. Or possibly a drey, we're not sure. I'm not totally convinced, either. Can anyone affirm or debunk?</p> <p><strong>4.40pm</strong> Jay Haas is playing out of his wrinkly old skin. He fends off the recent rally of Garcia and Westwood, and keeps the first game all square. Unfortunately a birdie from Riley on the twelfth has Clarke and Poulter three down.</p> <p><strong>4.43pm</strong> We have a difference of opinion over squirrels. Despite some early support for the dray, we have this from Ian Magilton: \"A dray is where they live,\" explains Ian. \"The collective name for squirrels is a coven (if they are red) and a hoard if they are grey, or in America, where they come from, they're referred to as a bunch.\"</p> <p><strong>4.46pm</strong> Furyk and Campbell win the eleventh to haul a point back from the European rookies. \"The bloke who wrote in re fried breakfast,\" begins George Woods, \"has highlighted a real problem. That is, the sort of person who says, 'I have got a terrible hangover and really need a fry-up to make me better.' A terrible hangover means you cannot breathe, see, drink water or slow the heart beyond about 120 beats per minute. That is why I have yet to ingest anything yet today and this screen is flickering like a 19th century Blackpool dirty postcard machine.\"</p> <p> <strong>4.53pm</strong> Lee Westwood pars the fourteenth to put the pressure on the Americans to halve the hole. No problem for Haas, who holds his nerve and a tricky putt to keep the first match all square.</p> <p><strong>4.57pm: Journalistic charlatan pulls the same stunt as he did at 3.26pm</strong><br> DiMarco/Haas 14 Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> (4 up) Woods/Riley 13 Clarke/Poulter<br> Furyk/Campbell 11 Casey/Howell (1 up)<br> (2 up) Cink/Love 10 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>5pm</strong> \"You might be interested to know,*\"says Andrew Cosgrove, \"that the adjective for 'pertaining to or like a squirrel' is sciurine.\" I am, Andrew, so no need for the caveat: \"*but then again you may not.\"</p> <p><strong>5.05pm</strong> Now, listen up, this is important. I'd like to carry out a social experiment. I want everyone reading this to think about, hum, and sing Whigfield's early-90s hit 'Saturday Night'. Go out tonight, and sing it to everyone you see, and encourage them to do the same to everyone they see. And if anyone comes up to me in Soho tonight and sings a line of 'Saturday Night' I will buy them the drink of their choice. That, and only that, will alleviate the self-inflicted agony that I have of having it stuck in my head. Ian Poulter, meanwhile, wins the thirteenth for Europe to pull a point back. The third match, meanwhile, is all square. </p> <p><strong>5.11pm</strong> Sergio Garcia pars the fifteenth to give Lee Westwood a free putt from about thirty feet. And he <em>almost</em> makes it. In the end, the first group head for the sixteenth still all square.</p> <p><strong>5.17pm</strong> Furyk and Campbell sink three consecutive birdies to really take the third game away from Casey and Howell. The scorecard looks ominously lopsided for the Europeans: <br>DiMarco/Haas 15 Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> (3 up) Woods/Riley 14 Clarke/Poulter<br> (1 up) Furyk/Campbell 13 Casey/Howell <br> (2 up) Cink/Love 11 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>5.24pm</strong> Harrington misses his third putt in a row, and the final pair go three down on the twelfth. But there's the <strong>first result of the day</strong>: Woods and Chris Riley defeat Clarke and Poulter by 4&amp;3, to take the overall score to 2.5 - 6.5</p> <p><strong>5.31pm</strong> DiMarco sinks a fifteen-foot putt on the sixteenth green to put the pressure on Sergio Garcia to keep Europe in with some hope of a point from this morning. No problem.</p> <p><strong>5.36pm</strong> Sergio Garcia tees off on the seventeenth with an enormous groan of 'Come on'. The ball follows his orders, and rolls down the back of the green towards the pin. Westwood is less fortunate, whereas DiMarco overshoots the green completely and is lucky to avoid the bunker.</p> <p><strong>5.44pm</strong> Sergio Garcia has a wonderful chance to go one up on the seventeenth after DiMarco misses his tricky shot. But he bottles it, and misses the hole by several inches. The big bottling bottler. Onwards to the eighteenth.</p> <p><strong>5.54pm</strong> Techie problems have kept me from informin... actually, see 3.16pm. Cink lands an easy putt to halve the fourteenth. Love and Cink look well set at three ahead.</p> <p><strong>6.04pm</strong> Oh dear. after much contemplation, Sergio Garcia tries to overhit the eighteenth pin and roll the ball back. But he goes too hard at it and ends up about fifty feet away. Westwood, from a similar position, gets it right and ends up with a ten footer to negotiate.</p> <p><strong>6.06pm</strong> Oh my word! Garcia takes his putt first and holes it for bogey. That was the moment of the day - an absolutely incredible putt that puts enormous pressure on Haas... which tells, as he misses the putt for par. On the sixteenth, meanwhile, Campbell is busy sinking his birdie putt.</p> <p><strong>6.10pm</strong> The top match ends <strong>all square</strong>, as Westwood misses his birdie putt by a whisker.</p> <p><strong>6.12pm scoreboard</strong><br> DiMarco/Haas F Garcia/W'wood (A/S) <br> 4&amp;3 Woods/Riley F Clarke/Poulter<br> (1 up) Furyk/Campbell 16 Casey/Howell<br> (3 up) Cink/Love 15 Monty/Harrington<br></p> <p><strong>6.22pm</strong> Howell has a putt to birdie the seventeenth, and he makes it to jubilation all round - well, on the European side at least, as they square the match going in to the eighteenth. Given the way the day has gone, it would be no bad thing for Europe to finish the morning with a deficit of just 2-1.</p> <p><strong>6.23pm</strong> Another cracking putt to seal a result, as Cink lands one from the edge of the sixteenth green to <strong>win the bottom match</strong> by 3&amp;2.</p> <p><strong>6.29pm</strong> Monty admits on't telly that he asked to be left out of this afternoon's matches, as he was knacked this morning, the lamb. So his run of 30 consecutive Ryder Cup matches comes to an end.</p> <p><strong>6.42pm</strong> It's all tense on the eighteenth green, as Furyk and Campbell try to suss their chances of stealing the most up-and-down of the day's matches. </p> <p><strong>6.47pm</strong> Chad Campbell double-bogeys the eighteenth and leave Paul Casey with the chance to putt for par, and <strong>a point Europe looked unlikely to get</strong> a few hours ago... and he makes it!</p> <p><strong>6.48pm</strong> Well, that settles the morning session. The foursomes are just getting underway, but I'm afraid that's your lot for the evening. Many thanks for all your emails, tune in tomorrow for more.</p>",

Celtic Seaweed Baths, in the picturesque coastal village of Strandhill, does exactly what it says on the tin bath - providing hour-long immersions in hot brine and seaweed. It's claimed the heat releases the weed's essential oils - and you thought it was just gunk - moisturising your skin, and helping with psoriasis and acne. </p> <p>At the same time, the centre says the seaweed's minerals and gel extract ease aching muscles, rheumatism and arthritis, while its natural iodine and calcium alginate help to heal wounds and burns.

  "<p>Stephen King pulls up on a red Harley Davidson Heritage Softail and removes his rather geeky helmet. He's early for his appointment to be photographed at his office in a bleak industrial estate in Bangor, Maine. The bike is improperly pristine and there are only 10,589 miles on the clock, most of them accumulated when he rode from Maine to California in the mid-90s on a book tour to promote his novel Insomnia (1994). \"I haven't ridden this thing for five years, since the accident,\" he says, gingerly lifting his injured leg over the saddle. King has the stiff gait of an older man (he's 56) and the diffident stoop of a too-tall adolescent (he's 6'4\"). \"I haven't ridden it because I have trouble working the brake with my right leg. Today, though, I thought I'd give it a try.\" </p> <p>King rummages in his saddle bag. \"I haven't looked in here for five years,\" he says, producing a bin bag from its interior. \"What's in here? Body parts, I guess. That's what you'd expect me to say.\" In fact, it contains waterproofs. </p> <p>The accident happened on June 19 1999. King was strolling alongside Route 5 near his home in Bangor and looking forward to seeing a film with his family later that evening. As he walked, a Dodge truck barrelled towards him. It was driven by Bryan Smith, a drug user with multiple driving convictions. A Rottweiler called Bullet was loose in the truck and had jumped on to a seat where there was a cooler of hamburger meat Smith had bought for a barbecue. Smith became distracted by his dog, swerved across the highway and hit King. The writer managed to turn his head a little before impact and thus missed being struck by a steel support post on the truck that would probably have killed him. </p> <p>King's head left a many-tentacled crack in the windscreen. He broke his right hip joint, four ribs and his right leg in nine places. His spine was damaged in eight places. \"The accident gave me a real sense of mortality, a sense of hurry that I didn't have before. Not immediately, but about a year after the accident I was able to say: 'That guy nearly killed me.'\" Smith died of an overdose 15 months later on September 21, King's birthday. </p> <p>As her husband lay in hospital, Tabitha King, who is also a writer, bought the battered truck, not - as many stories have had it - so he could later beat it with a baseball bat, but because at that stage, she was convinced he would die in hospital and didn't want it to wind up on eBay billed as the vehicle that killed America's most popular novelist. During the past five years, during which King has given few interviews - he has not talked to a British newspaper since 2000 - he has revisited the accident obsessively in his fiction. In the novel Dreamcatcher (2001), a character suffers an accident reminiscent of King's. In the recent TV series Kingdom Hospital, freely adapted by King from a Danish TV hospital series by Lars von Trier, a writer is run down by a truck in the opening episode and, after being saved from death by a computer-generated ant-eater, spends much of the rest of the series in a coma. From A Buick 8 (2002), about a seemingly haunted car, includes a scene in which a state trooper is killed in a car accident, and his e-novella - the first e-book to receive 500,000 downloads - was called Riding the Bullet (1999), and was about a hitcher on a lonely road who takes the wrong ride. But the most sustained re-imagining of the crash comes in King's latest book, The Dark Tower, the seventh and final volume of his epic fantasy sequence The Dark Tower. </p> <p>\"At first after it happened, I'd say: 'Really, my hip got broken and my leg got shattered, but I was never in danger.' In a sense that was true, but if he had hit me a little bit more to one side, I would have been paralysed, and three or four miles an hour faster and I would have been killed. It took me a little while to really face that.\" King has written that he didn't want to die like Chaucer or Dickens. He didn't want to leave this world with his equivalent of The Canterbury Tales or The Mystery of Edwin Drood unfinished. By his reckoning, after the accident, he had three books to write to get his 1,000-year-old gunslinging hero Roland Deschain to the Dark Tower and penetrate its manifold mysteries. \"I decided that I wanted to finish it. I wanted to be true to the 22-year-old who wanted to write the longest popular novel of all time. And I did: it's 2,500 pages long, maybe longer. I knew it was going to be like crossing the Atlantic in a bathtub. I thought I'm just going to keep on working, because if I stop I'll never start again.\" </p> <p>King began the series in 1970 aged 22 with The Gunslinger (which appeared in magazines, but was only published as a novel in 1982), inspired in part by a vision of mapping the fantasy quest of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings on to the epic landscape and six-shooter etiquette of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Over the years, as his fame grew with such extremely popular novels as Carrie (1974), The Shining (1977), The Stand (1978), IT (1986) and Misery (1987), a shadow rose behind those books. It was The Dark Tower, a gathering Manichean epic about a gang of time-travelling questers drawn from different places and times. As the novels piled up, the object of Roland's quest became clearer - to save the world from evil in an apocalyptic milieu called End-Time where the Dark Tower is located. It was a series read mainly by King's existing fans, but one to which he would return every few years, to add another doorstop of imaginative, densely interwoven text. So far King has sold three million Dark Tower books. While such figures do not compare well with the tens of millions achieved by his horror novels, now that the series is finished, King suspects things will change: \"I sorta hope that now the books are done people will feel it's safe to read them. Maybe the word of mouth will be good.\" </p> <p>The initial spur for the sequence was Robert Browning's 34-stanza poem \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\" - even though neither King nor its author knew what Childe Roland's quest amounted to. \"Browning's poem was like Coleridge's 'Kubla Khan' - it came to him in a dream. He woke up, wrote the poem and people said to him 'What does it mean?' and he said 'I don't know.' I've read that poem many times over the years and I still don't know what it means.\" </p> <p>King's Roland is a more optimistic American creation, a can-do gunslinger, the object of whose quest retreats not into depressing obscurity, but becomes clearer and more laden with symbolic import as he gets closer to it. He's a man who shoots first and asks questions hardly ever. And yet women want him and men - at least men like Stephen King - want to be like him: \"I had a myth in mind when I started of the strong, silent stranger, the outlander who wants to do good. I think a lot of it for me just comes out of the - I don't know how to pronounce this word - iconography of heroes. Somebody who's brave and unbending.\" </p> <p>So unbending is Roland in his quest that in the first novel he deserts a child called Jake, allowing him to fall to his death rather than deflect Roland from his grander mission. There is a biographical resonance here: King's father went out for a packet of cigarettes when the writer was two and never came back. In The Dark Tower, Roland regularly exhorts his assembled gang-members: \"Do not forget the face of your father,\" as though doing the right thing consisted of fidelity to one's father's memory. This seems an odd expression for King to have devised, not least because so often in his fiction we come across abandoned children who have to forget the faces of their useless fathers (and mothers) to flourish independently. \"That expression came from nowhere,\" King says. \"But it makes sense to me because I live in a patriarchal society where you have the Big White Daddy in the White House. Which is amusing because I was raised by women, my mother and her sister. My father deserted, sure. But don't go making anything Freudian about that.\" </p> <p>In his memoir, On Writing (2000), King recalls that, after his father left, he \"lived an odd, herky-jerky childhood, raised by a single parent who moved around a lot\". When, after much wandering, the family finally settled back in Durham, Maine, he explored a relative's attic and found a collection of his father's things, including an anthology of HP Lovecraft horror stories. \"That book, courtesy of my departed father,\" wrote King in Danse Macabre (1980), \"was my first taste of a world that went deeper than the B-pictures that played at the movies on Saturday afternoon.\" He wrote his first horror story aged seven, and later acquired an Underwood typewriter whose letters kept breaking. Like Paul Sheldon, the novelist in Misery, he had to fill in some of the letters by hand. </p> <p>At high school, his first published story, \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\", appeared in Comics Review. After graduating, he wrote Getting It On, a novel he later published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman as Rage (1977). The story dealt with an outsider who holds a high-school class hostage. After shootings such as the one at Columbine High School, King withdrew the book from publication. He continued to write at the University of Maine, where he had arrived in 1966 with a bumper sticker for Republican Barry Goldwater on his car. But student protests against the Vietnam war radicalised King: he sold his car, grew his hair to his shoulders and put a sticker on his backpack saying \"Richard Nixon is a War Criminal\". </p> <p>At the time, he also played guitar in coffee houses, steeping himself in protest music. \"I played a lot of folk music in the 60s - Dylan, Donovan, Dave van Ronk, Phil Ochs - that's where I picked up what chops I have.\" King still plays guitar and sings. For the past decade he has played in the Rock Bottom Remainders, a writers' band featuring Miami Herald humourist Dave Barry, novelists Barbara Kingsolver, Scott Turow and Amy Tan, and Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Once they went on tour with Warren Zevon, who insisted King sing his tune, \"Werewolves of London\". \"I was shy to do it because he wrote the song. He took me aside and said: 'It would be the apex of my career', and he was not kidding. So I did it.\" It's a song for a horror writer to sing, with a memorable howling chorus, \"Aah-woo, werewolves of London\", and such couplets as, \"He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent\". </p> <p>At college, King supported himself by working in the library. He started to write the first story in The Dark Tower series on coloured library paper. He met his future wife, Tabitha, while in the stacks. She was attracted to him, but amazed at his poverty: \"He had nothing to eat, he had no money, he had no clothes,\" she says. \"It was just incredible that anybody was going to school under those circumstances, and even more incredible that he didn't care.\" She married him shortly after they graduated. </p> <p>Unable to find a high-school teaching job after college, King earned occasional payments from men's magazines for short stories, while working at an industrial laundry washing table linen from Maine's lobster joints (\"The maggots would try to crawl up your arms as you loaded the washers; it was as if the little fuckers knew you were planning to cook them,\" he wrote). </p> <p>He and his wife were living in a trailer with two kids when his first novel was rejected by Doubleday, disappointing King and prompting him to take a $6,400 teaching job. As he taught, he began a short story called \"Carrie\" - about a high-school misfit with a repressed religious mother, who discovers she has telekinetic powers and uses them to wreak bloody revenge in the story's prom night denouement. But he threw the manuscript in the bin because he thought the opening women's shower scene unrealistic. Tabitha retrieved it and persuaded him to continue. </p> <p>Doubleday bought the hardback rights for $2,400; but the King family's fortunes rocketed when he was paid $400,000 for the paperback rights by New American Library. He used some of that money to pay for medical bills for his mother, who was dying of uterine cancer. In February 1974, he gave the eulogy at her funeral. \"I think I did a pretty good job,\" he wrote, \"considering how drunk I was.\" Years later he wrote Dolores Claiborne (1992), about a tough Maine woman and her ungrateful daughter, partly in homage to his mother. </p> <p>King had been drinking hard for the best part of a decade by the time his mother died and he continued to do so as his literary success grew with books such as the vampire novel Salem's Lot (1974) and The Shining. The latter was about a man suffering from writer's block who goes mad and tries to kill his family in a snowbound, haunted hotel. \"I was the guy who had written The Shining without realising that I was writing about myself.\" For years, he gave himself what he calls \"the Hemingway Defence\": \"As a writer, I am a very sensitive fellow, but I am also a man, and real men don't give in to their sensitivities. Only sissy-men do that. Therefore I drink.\" </p> <p>Shortly after the publication of The Tommyknockers (1987), though, King's family and friends organised an intervention, dumping his rubbish on the rug in front of him to show him the evidence of his addictions. It included beer cans, cigarette butts, traces of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil. </p> <p>With The Shining, filmed by Stanley Kubrick in 1980, Stephen King became a brand whose name could sell a book. Film deals also contributed to his rapidly increasing wealth. With so many different publishers, and editions of his novels in print in many different languages all over the world, it is impossible to calculate how many Stephen King books have been sold. But in 1998 he was widely reported to have earned $40 million. </p> <p>King is fiercely critical of the film of The Shining (\"It's not scary at all. Jack Nicholson basically fell back on character tics he developed on American international biker pictures 10 years before. The guy's crazy when you meet him so there's no arc of character development\") and adapted the novel himself as a less successful TV movie. But the novel also gave him literary clout. Professor Michael Collings, of Pepperdine College, Malibu, one of King's most sensitive critics, says: \"The Shining probably has the best chance of his books to date of surviving the ages. It tells a good story, and tells it in strong, memorable images. It incorporates his trademark horror, but in a rather restrained way. And it is literary.\" </p> <p>King was equally unimpressed by the film version of The Running Man (1987), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"The main character in the novel was this pre-tubercular guy who'd got radiation poisoning from working in a factory. Nothing like pumped-up Arnie.\" The plot features a reality game show in which participants are hunted, and earlier this year TV executives asked King if they could make it into a topical satire of reality TV. \"And I'm like 'Sure, but you've got to film the ending.' The ending is a guy hijacks a jet and flies it into a skyscraper killing everybody. The guy does it because he perceives everybody in the skyscrapers as agents of the great satan. The execs lost interest pretty quickly.\" </p> <p>But in general, King says, \"I think I've been well served by movies adaptations of my work.\" Frank Darabont, who adapted two of King's most humane fictions, The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999), into two extraordinarily successful films, says: \"I've always been drawn to his voice as an author. To me he's up there with Dickens, who was a great populist storyteller. Dickens was a bleeding heart for humanism. Now people are catching on to the fact that King is very much more like that than they thought.\" David Cronenberg, who directed an adaptation of The Dead Zone (1983), is another admirer: \"Stephen King has said he is the Big Mac of literature, and I think he's right. He taps into a mass pulse and that's his strength. He takes people along a path they would not normally go. A lot of people. That restricts what he can do, as well. But in his case that's not a restriction; that is the ideal. He's doing exactly what he wants to do, and is an absolutely pure and integrated artist.\" </p> <p>King lives up to his horror-brand status, ringing his house in Bangor (a building redolent of Norman Bates's family home in Psycho ) with fences decorated with spiders webs, bats and gargoyles. The fence partly went up to give King privacy from the fans with whom he has an intriguing relationship. In Misery, a bestselling novelist winds up strapped to a bed by an obsessed fan, furious at him for killing off a beloved fictional heroine (the eponymous Misery), who finally shatters his legs with a hammer. The message seems clear: readers can be a nuisance. King makes this point when he explains how The Dark Tower series ends. \"No matter how it ended people were going to be pissed off with me. Nothing will make them happy!\" On the King website message board most correspondence has been from fans irritated that King plumped for that post-modern device of introducing himself as a character in the sixth volume. \"They always accuse me of having done this. And it doesn't matter how many times you say to the readers: 'You don't understand. I didn't do anything. The story did me.' They just don't get it.\" </p> <p>But fans' irritation is nothing by comparison with the bile that King attracted last year when he was awarded the National Book Foundation annual medal for distinguished contribution to American letters. Harold Bloom called the decision \"a terrible mistake\", claiming that King was unfit to join such previous winners as Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, John Updike and Toni Morrison. In the Boston Globe, Bloom argued that the award was \"another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life... He is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis... By awarding it to King they recognise nothing but the commercial value of his books, which sell in the millions but do little more for humanity than keep the publishing world afloat.\" Bloom says that \"the triumph of the genial King is a large emblem of the failures of American education\". </p> <p>King dragged himself from a hospital bed, where he had been suffering from pneumonia, to accept the award, and in his acceptance speech acknowledged that not all of his more than 40 novels, nearly all bestsellers, are literature. \"Some are entertainment; some are literature,\" he said. \"Just don't ask me to define literature.\" He called on the publishing elite to \"build bridges between the so-called popular fiction and the so-called literary fiction\". </p> <p>What does King think about that critical dispute now? \"In the end what interests me is, say, when you pick up a copy of USA Today and you see To Kill a Mockingbird or Catcher in the Rye pop up on the bestseller lists week after week, year in year out. I've thought a lot about Somerset Maugham lately because he is the person who is closest to me in terms of being extremely popular in his time and in his time achieved a certain amount of literary respectability after a period of being dismissed as a popular novelist. That's happened to me, and for the same reasons - not necessarily because I got any better, but just because I got older. And also because I outlived my worst critics. So I've got a critical reputation - it might not be deserved and in the end it's only time that will tell.\" How the test of time will apply to The Dark Tower novels is uncertain, but King is hopeful they will join the Lord of the Rings and the Gormenghast trilogy as fantasy fictions of enduring popular appeal. </p> <p>Is King going to retire now that he has completed a novel sequence that he regards as a summation of all his other works and in which lots of characters from his other books appear? \"I'm retiring from all the bullshit. I don't want another book contract.\" He doesn't plan to work much for the next few months; instead, he's going to campaign for John Kerry in the swing state of Florida. \"We're not in good odour with the world under Bush. And it's a shame because we took a bad hit on September 11 and Bush pissed away a lot of goodwill.\" Kerry, however, doesn't fill him with enthusiasm, not least because King favoured anti-war Democratic candidate Howard Dean. </p> <p>He has another book written, though he says it's \"a mess\", and has yet to decide whether anybody else should read it. It is about a writer's widow, and came about when he returned home from his hospitalisation for pneumonia to find his wife redecorating his office. \"My wife says to me: 'Don't go in your office'. Like Bluebeard or something. I said 'Why not?' She says: It's just a mess in there and it will really upset you. One night I couldn't sleep and I went out there and she was right - it upset me. The furniture was all gone. The books were off the shelves. Everything was in boxes. It was just like a room that has been cleared out following an old person's death. It got me thinking about my own death and what would happen afterwards.\" </p> <p>Why does King write about death so much? \"I forget who said this but it's true: all literature is supposed to do is to rehearse us for death. And one of the ways we deal with it is with our imaginations. One of the nice things about fantasy fiction is that it's sometimes possible to have it both ways. In fantasy fiction more than any other we're able in an allegorical way - I don't want to get high-blown about this - we're able to deal with death. In fantasy fiction when characters return as ghosts they just come back in a different form. That's a masked way of saying life continues.\" </p> <p>On the last page of The Dark Tower, he writes: \"I never worked harder on a project in my life, and I know - none better, alas - that it has not been entirely successful.\" Now he has completed his personal equivalent to The Canterbury Tales and The Mystery of Edwin Drood, can he die fulfilled? \"It's always the way. I know what I wanted to achieve and not all of it is on the page. That's the writer's torment.\" So why continue the torment? \"Let's not go crazy. It's just such a buzz to write. While I'm doing it, there's nothing better in life. It's what I was made to do. </p> <p>\"I'm terrifically lucky. Because besides the writing I'm married to a woman I love, I've got three children who are good - they aren't in jail. None of them is addicted to anything. Three grandchildren. I've been addicted to cocaine and pain killers and I'm not any more - well, I'm still addicted but I don't use them. Don't drink any more. Plus, I'm one in a million - I got a talent nobody else has.

She would also be the first American to head the worldwide Anglican communion. She has denied any interest in becoming a bishop, but her admirers would be keen for her to change her mind. \"She's clever, she has a strong sense of social justice, and we need women in positions of power in the CofE,\" says Giles Fraser. </p> <p><b>Licensee of the Queen Vic, EastEnders</b></p> <p><b>Who?</b> Chloe Jackson <br><b>Current job</b> Infant <br><b>Age now</b> Three</p> <p>Nominated by Kevin O'Sullivan, Daily Mirror features editor and soap fan</p> <p>When Sonia Jackson gave birth to her daughter Chloe in October 2000, it came as a huge shock to the residents of Albert Square - Sonia didn't even know she was pregnant.

  "<b>Dear Mark</b> <br> I've been thinking about the conference in Bournemouth next week. With the media finally accepting we are into three-party politics now, we must be clear where we stand on those two old chestnuts social liberalism and economic liberalism in terms of Lib Dem policy. <p>I don't know what you think, but on that first one, social liberalism, I feel there isn't a big discussion to be had because generally the party is pretty clear about it. I mean, if social liberalism means the state has no right to moralise at its citizens but has to guarantee equal opportunities for everyone, surely members of the party are not going to object.</p> <p>For instance, I think I agree with you on ID Cards - you're against them, right? I certainly hope so - as they seem to epitomise the worst aspects of Big Brother intervention. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> I couldn't agree more: what we are all looking for is for everyone to get good services in a fair way. We don't want a two-tier service where the rich can pay more for better facilities. The question is, how do we make public services better? It's a nonsense to say that all services have to be public or that they all have to be private. Isn't it about both of them working together to provide a free service at the point of delivery?</p> <p>As for ID cards, yes, of course I'm against them, but I feel it important to argue not just on civil liberty grounds; as liberals we should also make the pragmatic case against them. Surely the \u00a33bn that such a scheme would cost could be better spent on intelligence and policing as a way of tackling the crime and terror threat, though let me be clear: the fact that I do not argue against them on civil liberty grounds does not make me any less liberal. I just want to convince as many people as possible of our arguments. <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> I note what you say about ID cards, though I am tempted to try to get you to argue against them on civil liberty grounds. They are appalling in terms of privacy and freedom from state snooping, which after all can be pretty dangerous when individuals who are corrupt find work in the state machine.</p> <p>In terms of public services I do agree that it is right to avoid a two-tier system and make sure that central services such as health, education, and policing are free at the point of delivery. But I do think the party needs to come to a view about the private-public split in terms of providers and service delivery. We cannot run away from this, Mark: people will ask us about it anyway. What think? <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> Glad we agreed on ID cards. But on health, we don't have a problem with the beds and the wheelchairs and equipment being made privately; why should it be a problem if some of the buildings and staff are from private companies? Surely what matters is that it is free for everybody and the NHS is the gatekeeper for everyone. But if that's too controversial for the party then maybe we should forget public-private and try to make more of mutuals and the voluntary sector running things.</p> <p>And so far neither of us has talked about how you make these services accountable, so let me really test your liberalism with this. We always assume that having elected politicians brings accountability, but with such low turnout it is hardly very accountable. Maybe we need to find better ways of getting communities involved with running some services themselves. <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> Strong stuff, Mr Oaten. In theory, what you say could work. There is no technical reason why farming it out to private providers or mutuals cannot work. After all, it is, I suppose, a bit dogmatic to absolutely insist the whole thing is state controlled. But I fear that the private sector might create undesirable pressure to cut costs and increase profits. Isn't there a danger that areas of high expense will experience decision-making by accountants while the NHS tends to leave it to clinical practitioners? And are you really saying that you believe the private sector is so much better that what it takes in profit is more than made up for in efficiency savings? I doubt it.</p> <p>While I have no issue with seeing some services from the private sector, if they are great value, allowing people to opt out of the NHS and into private healthcare seems well dodgy: after all, if lots of people do it, it will put pressure on us to downsize the NHS and we will end up depending on the private sector. Market forces would then push prices up. </p> <p>Call me old fashioned, but I would rather pay what it takes to get great services in the NHS than what it costs to go outside. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> Good stuff indeed, Lembit, and I can be convinced of the danger of poor quality service if profit is the main motive. I think doctors and nurses in private hospitals would rightly take issue with you, but on balance I'm convinced by your desire for a cautious approach.</p> <p>Given that I'm moving in your direction on that, how about tackling my point about the dreaded issue of choice and accountability? I think people want a good local hospital, but frankly they don't mind too much who runs it as long as it is free. And what about this question of accountability? Can we find a better system than local councillors to engage the public? <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p> PS Well impressed you haven't mentioned asteroids yet.</p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> I haven't mentioned asteroids because I don't want to create global panic with what I know. But even in the run-up to Armageddon I still think we need good public services. I am less worried about accountability because I think people will do their best and know what that means without being hectored by government, but I'm not sure what you mean by a better system than local councillors: when I was a councillor in Newcastle back in the last millennium I felt the system worked pretty well and that decisions were generally made sensibly. </p> <p>What I am most worried about is levels of management because what bothers people is all this stuff about red tape and bureaucracy. It is easier to add levels than to trust the experts to manage things for themselves. Maybe here is where we can get the benefit of private sector practice and public sector service at the same time. If the state was competent at identifying the best people in health, education and so on, employing them within the public sector and then negotiating how much it would cost for a given level of service, then surely we would get private sector efficiency without the profit ethos.</p> <p>I think politics should be more confident about employing top quality managers and giving them the resources to manage without fear. Those managers will have an outcomes focus and get the results we want. I think that on the whole Britain's services are not bad. All it would take to make them great is those managers and a willingness by the government to trust them. If the Lib Dems did that, the public sector could apply the best practice from the private sector without the profit motive.</p> <p>If economic liberalism comes to that, then I'm all for it. All it needs is a little bit of insight, enough faith in human nature and a belief that people do their best when they are given the space to give it a go. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> Hear, hear to getting rid of Westminster control and central targets. My point about local councillors is that we have to be careful not to replicate that national control on a local level.</p> <p>I am completely with you on good management. When I visit a hospital, school or prison I can often tell how well it will be run, based on the chief executive, headteacher or governor. Rewarding these people well in the public sector is important, but when it comes to pay we must not ignore the low salary nurses have to start their career on.</p> <p>I think we have found some common ground, and although I'm not convinced about things falling from the sky I am convinced that we will get clarity on this as a party as long as we are willing to discuss it. I'll buy you a drink at conference and let's talk about this in more detail. <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> It's a deal. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lembit Opik MP is the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Wales, Northern Ireland and youth affairs; Mark Oaten MP is the party's chief spokesman on home affairs.</p>",
  "<p>Formula one was thrown into crisis yesterday when the Jaguar team were put up for sale by their owner Ford along with Cosworth Racing, the Northampton-based specialist which also supplies engines to Jordan and Minardi. </p> <p>Unless a buyer can be found or another engine supplier volunteers to fill the gap, Ford's decision could jeopardise Jordan and Minardi as well as removing the Jaguars from the starting grid after the last three races of the season. More than 500 jobs are threatened. </p> <p>The decision was greeted with disdain by Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial rights holder, who also accused Ford of supplying overpriced and substandard Cosworth engines to the smaller teams. </p> <p>He said: \"I am not sorry to see them go. They have ripped off Jordan and Minardi on the price of engines. They cost more than the Ferrari engines which are used by Sauber. </p> <p>\"This is all down to bad management and shows that manufacturers just use the sport if and when they want to. It appears that they wanted to run the team, get all the publicity, but not pay any money for it. I would like them to see [if they could get] a deal to get all their global advertising for free.\" </p> <p>The decision to sell the Jaguar team came at the same time as a decision to close Jaguar Cars' factory in Coventry with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs. </p> <p>It is impossible to assess the team's value but it may yet be in Ford's interest to pay $50m (\u00a328m) for a new owner to take over to avoid the huge costs involved in shutting the team down. </p> <p>Richard Parry-Jones, Ford's chief technical officer and the driving force behind the Jaguar formula one team, said that poor global Jaguar car sales were partly to blame. </p> <p>He also blamed the sport's powerbrokers, however, for not sharing commercial rights revenues more equitably or making a serious effort to contain costs. \"We had anticipated that the sport would undergo reform but it has not,\" he said. \"Various companies derive income from the sport. We have discussed with the current incumbent [Ecclestone] several alternative schemes but nothing has happened. We want to win in formula one and not just be there taking part.\" </p> <p>Parry-Jones made it clear that the company had examined the possibility of rebranding the team under Ford's blue oval but that no case could be made under the current economic conditions. </p> <p>\"Jaguar Cars is not going to participate in F1 after the end of this year,\" he said. \"Ford has examined many other options for using its valuable F1 businesses in roles for other brands. But there is no compelling business case for such action.\" </p> <p>The team have been competing in formula one since 2000 after the Stewart-Ford squad was rebranded in Jaguar's British racing green livery. The $120m operating budget is modest by formula one standards and the team are struggling in eighth place in the constructors' championship with only 10 points, 224 behind the leaders Ferrari. </p> <p>Eddie Jordan said he was deeply concerned. \"I was told 20 minutes before the official announcement. I haven't yet thought about approaching any other company for engines.\" </p> <p>Minardi's principal Paul Stoddart said he hoped for some resolution.\"We will be working closely with Cosworth representatives to find a workable solution for next season. We are confident of arriving at a suitable arrangement.\" </p> <p>Possible buyers of the Jaguar team include the Red Bull energy-drink founder Dietrich Mateschitz, whose earlier talks with Ford about committing to an investment in Jaguar foundered at the last moment. It is believed that the decision to complete the deal had been made but that Ford accountants in Detroit vetoed it because it would have involved additional expenditure on Jaguar's part. </p> <p>The current team manager Tony Purnell may also be interested.</p>",
  "<p>Are you a smooth operator when it comes to telephone interviews? Or do you freeze at the thought of faceless interrogation on the dog and bone? These days almost a third of graduate recruiters use telephone pre-screening - and it's a figure that has tripled over the past three years. </p> <p>While preparing for a telephone interview is little different from its face-to-face equivalents, \"phoners\" do have distinctive characteristics and arrive in a variety of guises. Most graduate recruiters will schedule a time in advance, but unannounced phone interviews are common with small-to-medium-sized companies (such as ad agencies or solicitors). Either way, phone interviews can last up to one hour - so it pays to be prepared. </p> <p><strong> 1. Do your homework</strong> </p> <p>The good news is that large graduate recruiters should give you full briefings on how their telephone interviews will be structured. Your careers service will also have reference material to boost your preparation. Swot up on major industry players, recent events and the company's media image. And just like a face-to-face interview, go back to the job ad or description and think about how you match the skills the firm is after. \"I'm shocked at how many people can't handle the basic questions,\" says Julian Bell, graduate recruitment manager at Diageo. \"Standard questions like 'What are your five top skills?' or 'Tell me about a time you have influenced somebody or led a team' aren't rocket science, but they throw people.\" </p> <p><strong> 2. Practice makes perfect</strong> </p> <p>Buddy up with a friend who is also going for interviews and practise mock interviews together. Give each other constructive feedback. \"People who have done that stand out an absolute mile,\" explains Julian Bell. Meanwhile, Graham Keating, a careers adviser with the University of Manchester, even recommends recording your practice answers beforehand. \"The major difference between face to face and telephone communication is the lack of visual contact,\" he says.\"Therefore, an awareness of how you sound is as useful as what you say - if not more so.\" </p> <p><strong> 3. Set the scene</strong> </p> <p>Make sure the environment is right. \"It's shocking. I've had people do phone interviews on a bus because they haven't arrived home in time,\" says Julian Bell. \"Get a room to yourself. Make sure it's nice and quiet. Stick a note on the door if you have to.\" If there is a chance you might be phoned by surprise, warn your flatmates and ensure that you have a respectable answering message. \"It may be a clich\u00e9 to say, 'You never get a second chance to make a first impression,'\" says Graham Keating, \"but it remains painfully true. And remember, you could be the one who answers the phone and a dozy sounding 'Yeah, who is it?' is not going to help.\" </p> <p><strong> 4. Keep your application handy</strong> </p> <p>Do yourself a favour and have the relevant application form or CV nearby. One advantage of a telephone interview is that you can refer to your original application as you speak. Reacquaint yourself with it beforehand. \"The dreadful sound of silence punctuated by frantic rustling of paper and the odd expletive while you search for the relevant form will not create that important good first impression,\" says Graham Keating. Also have a pen and paper close by, to take notes. </p> <p><strong> 5. Dress up</strong> </p> <p>Conducting an important interview in your pyjamas might undermine your impact. Bizarre as it sounds, you could gain a psychological edge if you dress as you would for a face-to-face event. \"Your voice can be influenced by your posture too,\" adds communication expert Juliet Erickson. \"So sit up straight or stand up. Keep both feet on the floor. If you're lounging about in your chair, or lying on the sofa, I guarantee you're not going to come across so well.\" </p> <p><strong> 6. Structure your answers</strong> </p> <p>Practise delivering your evidence rather than relying on a stream of consciousness. \"You have to offer convincing mini-narratives,\" advises careers consultant John Lees. \"Begin with a situation - a time, place and context where you used a particular skill. It doesn't have to be an earth-shattering event. Talk about your individual contribution. If your contribution was as part of a team, how effectively did you fulfil your team role? Then talk about the outcome.\" Speak slowly and clearly. Smile too - the enthusiasm this generates will be conveyed through your voice. </p> <p><strong> 7. Prepare some questions</strong> </p> <p>Finally, have your questions ready. \"Too many graduate candidates smile gratefully because the grilling is over and say 'I think you've told me everything I need to know,'\" adds John Lees. \"Wrong answer. What you say now could be remembered far more than anything else you have uttered during the interview. Don't ask no-brainer questions about company structure . Use this chance to ask questions about the way the role might develop and about opportunities for training.\" </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barlowtom@hotmail.com\">barlowtom@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>If you've been considering cycling to work, and assuming you can persuade your employer to back this, there may be just the incentive you need- a new bike and equipment at half the normal price. Last week Jobs &amp; Money revealed the little-known home computer initiative (HCI) that allows staff to save 40% of the cost of a new personal computer by buying it through their employer. Now you can do the same with bicycles. The bike scheme works in exactly the same way as the computer scheme. The employer buys the bike, and any accompanying equipment, and then deducts the cost through the employees' monthly wage packet - typically over 12 or 18 months. </p> <p>Crucially, staff pay no tax or National Insurance on their repayments, and after VAT rebates and other discounts are taken into account, most employees will end up paying a shade over half the showroom price for their package. As well as the bike itself, users can buy locks, lights, waterproofs, helmets and any other safety equipment. The main difference between the bike and computer schemes is that employees have to use the bike \"mainly\" to cycle to work. Under the scheme, there is no requirement to use the machine for work purposes. In practice, there is nothing to stop you buying a bike and cycling to work in the summer months. Equally, you are allowed to return to your car when the weather is less kind.</p> <p>Last week's Jobs &amp; Money described the computer initiative as Britain's most secret tax break, but the cycle purchase scheme really is unknown - just a handful of companies have so far implemented it - but that could be about to change. The cycle and motor accessories retailer Halfords is launching a big push to make more employers aware of its existence. \"The scheme is complicated and is not widely known, but it makes a lot of sense for any company who wants to offer employees an extra benefit, as well as to encourage them to take more exercise,\" says Halfords business-to-business manager, Paul Bullett.</p> <p>\"It works in the same way as the home computer initiative and the details are outlined by the Inland Revenue in its Green Travel plan (IR176). It contains a few restrictions -for example, employees can only buy adult bikes, and although there is no limit an employee can spend, some companies do impose them.\" </p> <p>Mr Bullet suggests it offers such good value that it will soon be cheaper for Halfords staff to purchase bikes through its own scheme - which starts next month - than to use the staff discount. He also says it fits neatly with the government's drive to get more people taking exercise.</p> <p>One of the first to implement the bike tax break is oil company Total UK. After successfully helping over 600 staff to buy personal computers, the French-owned firm is now implementing the bike purchase scheme. Having offered 1,500 admin, forecourt and other staff the chance to take part, 130 have already taken delivery of their bikes, with more on the way. Total's HR sourcing manager Julian Power says: \"We see this as offering an extra dimension to our staff benefits package and one that fits in with our objectives to reduce our impact on the environment and help improve staff fitness.\"</p> <p>Total UK has teamed up with Halfords which administers the scheme on the firm's behalf. Employees are given a letter of credit which they take to their local store and choose the equipment they want. Most of its staff are choosing bikes around \u00a3350 and spending \u00a350 on accessories. Employers wanting to introduce the scheme can contact an independent organisation called Booost, which is free and helps organisations market the scheme to employees. Although it principally aims to work with organisations with at least 3,000 staff, it will advise and help smaller companies too. </p> <p>Booost: 01582 406111 or <a href=\"http://www.booost.uk.com\">booost.uk.com</a> Halfords: 08700 660511 or <a href=\"http://www.halfordsb2b.com\">halfordsb2b.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.InlandRevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/ir176.htm\">InlandRevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/ir176.htm</a></p>",
  "<p>House prices are beginning to slip for the first time in almost two years according to the latest figures from Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender. A growing band of experts are predicting a correction or crash, call it what you will, in the near future. This week a top economists on the Bank of England's interest rate committee said a 30% fall was a racing certainty. </p> <p>But, with the average house price in London still at a scary \u00a3244,628, this news makes little difference to the prospects of first time buyers in the capital where most properties are still way beyond their pockets. </p> <p>We set about trawling homes for sale in the Greater London area in a quest to find what, if anything, is available for under \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>The good news is that it is possible to find properties in this price range, providing you are not fussy about where you live. It might mean taking to the canals with a houseboat. </p> <p>A search through the property website <a href=\"http://www.findaproperty.com\">findaproperty.com</a> turned up 120 residential properties in London for under \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>The bad news, however, is that many have drawbacks. While there are a fair few studio and one-bedroom flats on the market for \u00a380,000-\u00a3100,000, they tend to be in less desirable areas of (very) outer London, often with poor transport links. If you work and play in the centre of town, this will mean hefty travel expenses. </p> <p>Many cheaper flats are in retirement blocks and not appropriate for young buyers, while others have features which would render them unmortgageable with most mainstream lenders. </p> <p>For example, we turned up a spacious one-bedroom flat in desirable Maida Vale for just \u00a385,000. This sounded too good to be true and, indeed, it was. The catch was that it had an unexpired lease of only 10 years, after which the property would revert to the freeholder. So any buyer who couldn't cough up the estimated \u00a390,000-\u00a3110,000 required to extend the lease, would be out on their ear after a decade. Such a short lease makes a property virtually unmortgageable. </p> <p>Lenders are wary of non-standard properties which may have more limited resale potential than your everyday semi-detached or terraced house, particularly in a falling market. Some may put a blanket mortgage ban on, for example, high rise, ex-local authority flats or flats above restaurants. Others may be prepared to give you a loan, but only if you have a sizeable deposit to put down. As a rule of thumb, the larger your deposit, the wider your choice of mortgages. But for first-time buyers, who are unlikely to have more than a 5% deposit to put down, it's worth shopping around among mortgage brokers before giving up on getting a standard loan on an unorthodox property. </p> <p><strong> 1. \u00a348,000:</strong> Thames Reach at Royal Artillery Quays in Woolwich, SE28. One way of getting affordable space is to buy on a shared ownership basis. Moat Housing Group is offering one bedroom apartments at \u00a3160,000 in this new build, riverside development where you buy a 30% share at \u00a348,000 and pay rent on the remaining share at \u00a3186 a month. The apartments come with designer kitchens, double glazing, gas central heating, communal gardens and allocated parking spaces. Details on 07002 662846. </p> <p><strong> Pros:</strong> Smart, new flat built to high spec with no work needed. Spectacular views.

In London, many areas are now infected with a kind of sclerosis that has effectively frozen the market. </p> <p>Figures from Halifax pointing to a downturn were supported this week by a National Association of Estate Agents survey showing the average property price in the UK fell for the third consecutive time last month. The trade body said over three quarters of estate agents believe prices have reached their peak. Asking prices were on average 1.3% lower than the previous month, dragging down the annual increase in house prices to 8.5%, from 10.3%. </p> <p>These figures and anecdotal evidence appear to show that buyers are waiting to see if prices drop further. </p> <p>Some experts maintain there is a crash on the way equal to a 30% drop from today's sale values. Steve Nickell of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, says: \"There is a significant probability that house prices will fall at some stage.\" </p> <p>Mr Nickell points to the widening gap between average earnings and property prices, which he says must fall back to the long-term average of 3.5 times from the current situation, where property prices are running at six times average earnings. </p> <p>A crash would bring many prices within reach of younger buyers. But should they expect a drop in prices on low to mid-priced homes any time soon? Whether in London or other parts of the country, the average three bedroom family home looks pretty safe if other indicators, including two key trends in employment, have a significant impact. This week unemployment fell by a further 16,000 to 1.4m, one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe. Bolstering the feel-good factor, recruit ment agency Manpower said the vast majority of employers that make up its survey of British industry are planning to take on staff over the next quarter. </p> <p>It is hard to see how confidence in property is about to collapse, say property firms, if employment levels remain high and that other key element - the bank base rate - has peaked at 4.75%.</p>",
  "British film makers, for so long the poor relations of their Hollywood counterparts, yesterday welcomed a new tax regime that will give up to \u00a34m toward the budget of the next Bend it Like Beckham or Trainspotting. <p>The tax credit will repair some of the damage caused to the industry earlier this year when filming on big budget movies such as Tulip Fever, starring Jude Law, collapsed following the sudden closure of a tax loophole. </p> <p>Peter James, whose production of The Merchant of Venice, starring Al Pacino, was made under the old tax regime, said the new system would encourage the British film business to shed its cottage industry image. </p> <p>\"It puts Britain firmly into the global commercial film market, instead of leaving it a parochial industry, which is what we feared might come out,\" he added. \"We were afraid that the new measure would be aimed at just making small British films.\" </p> <p>Mr James added that the credit will lock out opportunistic film investors who poured money into projects for a quick tax return, with no expectation of the film ever reaching multiplexes. </p> <p>Those abuses led to the Inland Revenue shutting down a different tax loophole in February this year, throwing many big-budget productions into chaos. </p> <p>Tulip Fever was the most high-profile casualty; The Libertine, a Johnny Depp film, received a last-minute rescue from the Isle of Man film fund. </p> <p>The credit is accompanied by a measure giving further tax relief if the film is a box office hit, a move Mr James said would prove \"very attractive\" to investors. </p> <p>The new tax regime will be unveiled by the Treasury on Tuesday. After months of negotiation with the industry, it has rubber-stamped a new version of section 48, a tax code that is a financial lifeline for producers. </p> <p>From 2006, homegrown films costing up to \u00a320m can claim back 20% of their budgets through the new arrangement. It means a British film at the top end of the scale can add \u00a34m to its budget and provides some certainty for an industry that regularly struggles for funding. </p> <p>A Treasury source said the government was keen to build on a record year for British film production in 2003, when \u00a31.17bn was invested in 177 features. However, that figure includes Hollywood blockbusters like Troy, partly filmed in the UK, and few homegrown hits. Industry observers pointed out that for every Bend it Like Beckham there are many flops. </p> <p>The box office failure of British films is often blamed on poor quality, but producers argue that their features struggle to get into multiplexes because the distribution market is dominated by Hollywood studios. The government is also looking at incentives for distributors to show British movies in their cinemas. </p> <p>Estelle Morris, the films minister, told the Guardian earlier this year that the government was determined to overhaul a tax system which has cost the Treasury an estimated \u00a3850m in loss of income. </p> <p>\"I want to give producers more financial security. There is an element in them that sometimes thinks 'this is the way it is, you had better cough up'. It is a very unusual sector and the one thing I would ask of them is to understand that for most of them one-third of their films are being financed by the taxpayer and that carries huge accountability and responsibility.\"</p>",
  "<p>Among the foreigners drawn into Afghanistan in the late autumn of 2001 by the hijacked airliner attacks on America's eastern seaboard were many, like myself, who were seeing the country for the first time. As the writer Robin Jenkins had more than four decades earlier, we saw beauty, desolation and ruin. His ruin had a different character to ours.</p> <p>Depending on the country we entered Afghanistan from, we saw how powerful empires had been unable to treat, with their rough medicine, this hard crust at the rim of their dominions. They had not been able to offer it their treatment, but nor had they been able to leave it alone, so they and their successors had scratched and poked at it instead, infecting it with warlords and weapons and broken industrial showpieces. If you came in from the south, the scab-pickers were Britain, the US and Pakistan. If you came from the north, it was Russia and Iran.</p> <p>In 2001, we were walking among the ruins of the end of the cold war; Osama Bin Laden as Islamist irregular general was a creation of the CIA, made to break the Soviets. The Afghanistan Jenkins recreates in his 1960 novel Some Kind of Grace lies in the cold war's early years, when the US and the USSR competed not only through arms shipments, ideology and nuclear posturing but through gifts of roads, schools and clinics.</p> <p>The strategists in Moscow and Washington may have been cynical, but the engineers, teachers and doctors from the superpowers weren't, not always. The Russians and the Americans shared a belief in progress and human mastery over nature. Without realising it, both wanted to see a world of pretty nuclear families - their women unveiled - driving cars and having barbecues at the weekend.</p> <p>One of the things which strikes the later visitor to Afghanistan about Jenkins' novel is that he shows how in this time of hope, the late 1950s, there were ruins already there. His is very far from a hopeless vision. But whatever our illusions about an idyll before the long, cruel Afghan war - which we tend to date from 1979, the year of the Soviet invasion - Jenkins removes them. He shows poverty, dirt, disease and despair generations old. He shows feudalism and backwardness, suspicion and bigotry, if tempered by generosity and piety. He portrays a local elite exposed to just enough of European and American ways to be attracted to them, without the ability to use them to change their country, and thus made more cynical themselves.</p> <p>In this book Afghan men are often said to look like Christ, but these Christs are not bringers of any good word; rather, harrowed peasants who wouldn't be surprised to be crucified, because crucifixion is the kind of thing that has been happening to men like them for thousands of years.</p> <p>When Jenkins describes the Bamian Buddhas, whose destruction by the Taliban was mourned around the world, it is to mock the pomposity of the conquerors who put them there before Britain, Russia or America existed. Looking at the Buddhas, the hero of Jenkins' novel, John McLeod, is reminded \"of the attempts by Renaissance artists to portray the infant Christ. Instead of divine innocence a crafty senility seemed to be achieved.\"</p> <p>How much is familiar in Jenkins' Afghanistan, and how much finds an echo now, down to the hero's decision at one point to pretend to be French in order to avoid death at the hands of British-hating locals whose religion and tribal pride have merged into one. The dust so fine that it is liquid, the ubiquity of weapons and the feudal levy of warriors by village, the isolation of women from outsiders, the ease with which well-paid, well-supplied foreigners make themselves comfortable at their compound dinner parties (although today they would be unlikely to wear black tie).</p> <p>Some things have changed. The everyday weaponry is more deadly. The poplars Jenkins writes of have largely disappeared into cooking fires; northern Afghanistan is bleakly deforested. Only the mulberry groves remain. And the outside world, for better and for worse, intrudes ever more deeply, usually to market rather than to teach. This is as true of global Islam - the Saudi brand, Wahhabism - as it is of satellite TV or Pepsi.</p> <p>It takes a bad book to remind us how hard it is to write a good one. Because this is not a bad book, let me make the reminder of how narrow a space there is between avoiding sentimentality, on one side, and making your characters expressions of pure cynicism, on the other. Jenkins finds this space. He finds another rare spot, that place of honesty where multiple contradictory truths reside, where men and women can be both wicked and brave, vengeful and remorseful, bigoted and generous; where, when they go looking for absolute truths, they fail to find them.</p> <p>\"Tell me,\" murmured McLeod, \"is it true, according to the Koran, that any faithful follower of Islam can make sure of his place in paradise by exterminating an infidel?\"</p> <p>The Commandant chuckled, rather sourly. \"Yes, I believe you could find that somewhere in the Koran,\" he said. \"It is like your own Bible. Everything is in it that suits you. If you wish to kill your enemy, search through the pages, and you will find sanction. If you wish to forgive him and love him like a brother you will find sanction for that, too. A man takes his choice of what God advises.\"</p> <p>McLeod and the man and the woman he is seeking in Afghanistan are from Scotland. In the hands of another writer this might be a barely relevant detail. They're all Brits, Europeans, westerners, abroad. Jenkins makes it otherwise. The hero's origins are expressed in the comparisons he makes and the language he uses. An Afghan headman is described through the eyes of McLeod - a senior British diplomat - as \"glaikit\" (senseless, silly). The hero is reminded at one point of Edinburgh Castle; he contrasts Afghan mountains with those of his native Wester Ross.</p> <p>Elsewhere the transference is more loaded. In his meetings with Afghans McLeod veers from contempt through an unpleasant disgust to admiration, almost an implied envy. They are the same emotions expressed hundreds of years ago by English and Lowland visitors to the remote glens and islands of Scotland, where English speakers were scarce.</p> <p>James Boswell, accompanying Samuel Johnson in Skye on a walk not much more than a generation after Culloden, talks of being accompanied by a local servant \"quite like a savage... the usual figure of a Skye-boy, is a lown with bare legs and feet, a dirty kilt, ragged coat and waistcoat, a bare head, and a stick in his hand, which, I suppose, is partly to help the lazy rogue to walk.\" Later visitors saw the Gaels more romantically.</p> <p>Besides being an atheist among believers and a wealthy foreigner among the poor, McLeod, in the glens of Afghanistan, is a Highlander among highlanders, seeing the squalor and the dignity both as an outsider and, through history, from within. He understands the destructiveness of progress, destroying worldly innocence and worldly ignorance together, but he is aware, too, of the dark side of that apparent innocence.</p> <p>It is not just governments which can make trouble for these archaic, unmodernised clans, but individual adventurers from big cities overseas, concealing their selfishness under a banner of romantic ideals - Lawrence of Arabia, Osama bin Laden - in a smaller way, some characters in Jenkins' novel and, perhaps, in a sense, even Bonnie Prince Charlie - exploiting and provoking the unworldliness of the glens into actions whose terrible consequences they cannot foresee.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A new edition of Some Kind of Grace by Robin Jenkins is published by Polygon this month</p>",
  "<p><strong> Silver linings</strong></p> <p> While Pankaj Mishra is right to bemoan western stereotypes of the uncivilised east (\"The barbarian invasion\", September 11), he is guilty of an equally unhelpful misapprehension when he writes that \"much of Europe lay torpid in the Dark Ages\". Most historians have long acknowledged that the centuries in question, far from being \"dark\", were a period of deep learning and social change. Surely it would be better to celebrate the enlightened achievements of both Orient and Occident than to engage in cultural points-scoring?<br><strong> Hugh Costello</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> Discovering Milosz</strong> </p> <p>I read Yeats's poetry as a student, afterwards discovering the majesty of the prose, at times unsure as to which outweighed the other, but glad of both.

Anyone who missed his well-weighed prose last week might want to make up their loss.<br><strong> Kevin Kiely</strong><br>Blackrock, Ireland </p> <p>As Seamus Heaney's very beautiful meditation on Czeslaw Milosz is sure to be reprinted, may I note two small slips. It was Blake, not Yeats, who asserted that without contraries there could be no progression. And the woman who looked over Hephaestos's shoulder at the shield he was making for Achilles was Thetis, not Venus.<br><strong> John Lucas</strong><br>Aegina, Greece </p> <p><strong> Road to the aisles</strong> </p> <p> \"In the picture\" (September 11), shows a big American parking lot. All the cars are parked at 45 degrees to the aisles. Has it never occurred to the managers of car parks in this country that diagonal parking is a very much more efficient use of space, and easier and more convenient for users, than parallel parking? Emerging from a right-angle slot, one has to move forward far enough to avoid the next adjacent cars before starting to turn along the aisle. Diagonally parked, one has already effectually half-way turned. It is easier, and the lanes between lines of parking spaces do not need to be so wide.<br><strong> Ian Leslie</strong><br>Ludlow </p> <p><strong> Why Wodehouse wrote</strong> </p> <p> I'm not sure that PG Wodehouse wrote for the money, as Peter Griffith of Droitwich seems to suggest (Letters, September 11). In a 1945 letter Wodehouse wrote: \"If you are a writer by nature, I don't believe you write for money or fame, or even publication, but simply for the plea sure of turning out the stuff. I really don't care much if these books [such as the one he wrote during his internment] are published or not. The great thing is that I've got them down on paper...\" He also remarked, in a letter of May 2, 1950, that the writer Michael Arlen hadn't written a line for 15 years and had said \"why shouldn't a writer retire?\" Wodehouse commented, \"How he fills in his time, I don't know. Can you imagine yourself not writing for 15 years?\" </p> <p>These are not the words of a man who wrote for the money - though I have no doubt that he enjoyed the perquisites it brought him.<br><strong> JAP Dutton</strong><br>Ellesmere Port </p> <p><strong> Work it out</strong> </p> <p>Will Hutton, in his review of books about work and leisure (\"Slow down, tune out, make peace\", September 11), suggests that by making work less driven, the authors are proposing something which if we were to practice and were emulated in the middle east and Asia, would limit the appeal of al-Qaida. However I think that there is an even more important reason for slowing down. The biggest challenge we face is not terrorism but global warming. And humankind's contribution to it is our western lifestyle, which is largely driven by consumerism and by our work ethic, in particular the work ethic of the western male. We, particularly the US, are encouraging the rest of the world to copy us. We on the contrary need to find ways of copying the third world, obviously not everything, but at least in finding ways that work can be relegated to serve us in a sustainable way rather than allow ourselves to be ruled by it.<br><strong> John Gleisner</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> Spits and spats</strong> </p> <p>The inaccuracies in Nicholas Lezard's choice Spitfire Ace (September 11) are explained by the fact that this book is a version of a television production, a medium given to distortion or disregard of historical fact in the manufacture of entertainment. </p> <p>Lezard's review conflates the \"big wing\" and the \"row of idiots\". The \"big wing\" was a tactic, urged by Douglas Bader under Leigh-Mallory in 12 group, whereby several squadrons were simultaneously committed with the intention of overwhelming Luftwaffe formations, rather than the allocation by Dowding of single squadrons to meet threats as they developed - an option brilliantly executed by Park in the much more embattled 11 group. Historians more or less agree that the Dowding-Park strategy paid off, but the controversy over the two sets of tactics continues. The \"row of idiots\" was the gleeful description of the compact squadron formations which the RAF used before it was seriously bloodied in 1939 in France and over England and the channel in 1940, after which the standard interception procedures were quickly modified, certainly before the \"big wing\" theory was tested. The proponents of the \"big wing\" may or may not have been right: what they were not was a \"row of idiots\".<br><strong> MF Barnett</strong><br>Leominster</p> <p>Send letters to <br>Review, <br>119 Farringdon Road, <br>London EC1R 3ER. <br><a href=\"mailto:review@theguardian.com\">review@theguardian.com</a> </p> <p>Letters may be edited for reasons of space.

  "<p>A few days after her mother died, my wife brought home 12 bin bags and some cardboard boxes full of things. I helped her carry them up from the car and the remnants of Margaret's life - books, papers, clothes - have been sitting in a corner of our hall ever since. That afternoon, I withdrew to our garden shed, a favourite refuge of mine, to think. </p> <p>A day later, I found myself at Tate Modern in London, in a room full of fragments of charred wood and twisted metal: Cornelia Parker's Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View . Both installation and sculpture, Cold Dark Matter is the remains of a garden shed (and its contents) which has been blown to pieces. Thousands of fragments are suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads, frozen in space, a constellation of objects including burnt books, garden tools, a bicycle wheel and an ice skate. A single light bulb at their centre casts strange shadows on the walls. The visual impact of Cold Dark Matter is immediate but its meaning unfolds more gradually. </p> <p>Entering the darkened gallery space you see the shadows and the shape of the sculpture first, a perfect cube about 10ft wide, hovering just above the floor. You are then pulled closer by the objects, slowly recognising them: a hairbrush, a hubcap, a child's tricycle, all of them burnt, damaged, useless. You are looking at the aftermath of an explosion. The artist gathered the objects from various sources, placed them in a garden shed and then, with the help of the British Army, blew the whole lot up. </p> <p>Parker likes doing violent things to her materials: she has shot, crushed and stretched objects before. Yet what is surprising about this piece is not its energy or movement but its peace and tranquillity. The white heat of the explosion exists now as a memory, like the original big bang alluded to in the title. The splintered debris from one second in time is frozen in space in a perfect cube. The heat and violence are history, seen now as a warped and tarnished silver plate, the singed pages of a picture book or a charred splinter of wood. Each immobile fragment once had its own story, once belonged to someone's life. The fragility of Cold Dark Matter, the delicate shards of blackened wood suspended in space, the emptiness at its centre, confronts us with our own mortality. </p> <p>How long do you need to keep a dead person's belongings? What do you keep and what do you throw away? These questions seem central to Parker's work, yet I can imagine my irreverent mother-in-law laughing at this over-interpretation of a shed full of junk. Surely part of the point of this piece is to blow apart intellectual posturing about art. There is a jokey, junk-shop aesthetic to this work (a humour which runs through most of Parker's art) that links it back to Marcel Duchamp. (His Fountain, a ready-made urinal in fact sits in an adjacent gallery, a testimony to the cataclysmic changes in art of the 20th century.) </p> <p>After Duchamp, artists only needed to think of something, to go to a shop and buy it. Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of Surrealism, scoured the flea markets of Paris for bits of junk, while Parker sought out the objects for Cold Dark Matter from car boot sales. Parker is just one of many contemporary artists who have ceased to \"make\" new things. She is part of the generation of young British artists, \"yBas\", who were celebrated for the shot of radical energy they brought to British art in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Yet behind the facade of newness, assumed to be inherent to their youth, there is not only a reluctance to look forward but also an urge to destroy. In part, it is an adherence to Dada and Surrealist ideology, a continuation of the ready-made tradition of Duchamp, in part a response to the relentless consumerism of the west. The artist has lost faith in production. She no longer creates; she collects, co-ordinates, configures. </p> <p>British artist Michael Landy followed Parker's destructive impulse to its logical conclusion. For Break Down he created an inventory of everything he owned, a list of over 7,000 objects, and then ground every one of them to dust. This extraordinary event took place in a disused department store in Oxford Street among thousands of shoppers, stressing the ever closer relation of art and commerce. </p> <p>There is a paradox confronting every artist: the need to preserve the past as well as destroy it; the need to give, as Parker does, new life to old materials. Hanging high within Cold Dark Matter is a book which suggests she has thought long and hard on these issues - its title is just visible: The Artist's Dilemma. </p> <p>Also among the carefully chosen objects in Parker's shed are a number related to childhood: toys, a picture book, a tricycle. Nostalgia is inherent to Parker's work; the objects you look at have a history, were once something else. In another work, Breathless , Parker collected the instruments of a brass band, crushed them completely flat and suspended them like the objects in Cold Dark Matter. Here the melancholy longing for the past is even more palpable, not least because the piece hangs in the Victoria and Albert Museum. </p> <p>Monuments and relics litter the yBa landscape: Damien's Hirst's shark, Tracy Emin's bed, Rachel Whiteread's house. Hirst's pickled animals function as trophies, pointing back to their life before being immobilised in a glass box. Away From the Flock , his perfectly preserved spring lamb, also elicits a very English vision of green rolling hills. With Tracy Emin, it is her bitter memories of her Margate childhood and adolescence that are evoked. Everyone I Have Ever Slept With was a tent in which the names of lovers, friends and family were embroidered, part diary, part monument. The now notori ous installation, My Bed is accompanied by used condoms, used tampons, empty vodka bottles. The objects, like the filthy, crumpled sheets, have no future except as museum relics. A Polaroid photograph of the artist gathers dust on the bedside table as if to emphasise this fact. The face is smiling and healthy, documenting happier times before those evidenced by the bed. No part of the artist's personal history is too small or too large to escape transfer to the art gallery; Emin has kept the cigarette packet her uncle was holding when he died in a car crash. </p> <p>In an extraordinary accident, which connects with Cold Dark Matter, the shed and the tent met a violent end, consumed by the recent fire in a London warehouse. Years earlier, the destruction, this time intentional, of another yBa icon took place not far away in a park in Bow. Rachel Whiteread's House was a concrete cast of a demolished house. For a few weeks in 1993 it stood as a sad reminder of an anonymous family's terraced home, before the demolition men moved in. </p> <p>Parker has lived in a condemned house, a dwelling due for destruction to make way for a motorway. The shed is somehow a surrogate home, a movable structure that paradoxically becomes permanent at the bottom of the garden. More fragile than a house, it nevertheless functions - like the beach hut or the womb-like space of the tent - as a refuge from the world or as a repository for things we cannot quite deal with. </p> <p>A few months after Margaret's death we scattered her ashes over a Cornish cliff. I remember watching the grey powder drift in the wind for a second and then disappear, leaving sea, sky and space. We will sort through her belongings one day soon. For the moment we are keeping them in the shed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Winner Sumantro Ghose, 39,lives in London.

To understand the logical necessities of how the world moves and changes is a pleasure almost as keen as music, to which mathematics is related. But it is a very rare soul who is moved to purely contemplative raptures: music has passion as well as order in it; and science is one of the most emotional things anyone can do. Scientists tend no more than musicians to harmonious lives or balanced personalities. Very great scientists, as Marek Kohn makes clear, are often men with no judgment at all outside their work. </p> <p>Of the six British Darwinists who are the focus of this study, two were more or less monsters; two were consumed in their old age by pet theories; only John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins are people you would actually want a conversation with, rather than a lecture from; and Maynard Smith, alas, died last year. </p> <p>Kohn is one of the best science writers we have. He has found here a fascinating subject: the development of Darwinist thought in Britain over 100 years, which he treats with balance and lucidity, illuminated by a lovely turn of phrase - one of his cranky genius subjects \"defies casual admiration\". This was RA Fisher, who once clenched his fist in rage at a subordinate while he was holding a mouse, which was crushed to death. \"See what you made me do!\" he shouted at his human victim, and threw the mouse corpse out of a window. Still, he grinned and forgot the matter when he saw the assistant pull a face. Kohn has been a scientist himself, and in his previous book actually produced a possible story of how and why the human brain evolved. He studied under one of his subjects, John Maynard Smith, who appears as the most attractive of the scientists here. </p> <p>Kohn's knowledge of how science works is backed by a rich store of anecdotes about what scientists actually do: my favourite has the young Desmond Morris at supper at a conference in Paris in 1954, asking why his hosts, Professor Haldane and his wife, Dr Helen Spurway, are avoiding the other stars of the occasion, Professor and Frau Lorenz. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"I'll tell you what the matter is,\" replied Dr Spurway: \"I've been fucked by Konrad Lorenz.\" Lorenz was a Nazi, Haldane a Stalinist who joined the party after visiting Russia at the height of the purges - he was impressed by the reverence with which they treated intellectuals. Kohn introduces one scientist still more loathsome, Otmar von Verschuer, a German who had studied twins using materials supplied from Auschwitz by his friend Josef Mengele; and whose rehabilitation after the war was supported by the devout Anglican RA Fisher. But Kohn is never indignant. He lays out the facts judiciously, with reverence for the extraordinary things that these men discovered. Besides, he makes it very clear that they were deeply embedded in the societies around them; and the sometimes grotesque political and social beliefs of the great Darwinists were as much a product of the arrogance of the British ruling classes as of the arrogance of science. Both of the party members in this story were Etonians. </p> <p>Although science is meant to be an international pursuit, accessible to everyone, there are national schools within it; and this is nowhere more true than in evolutionary biology. The story Kohn tells is of the rise of the Oxford school, to which almost everything seems like an adaptation. These are the men reviled by Steven Jay Gould as \"Darwinian fundamentalists\". They believed, in the words of Kohn's title, that there was \"a reason for everything\" and this reason must be natural selection. It's easy to underestimate the ambition of this project because most of us still think of evolution as an explanation for the variety of living things in the world. But the ambition of the Oxford school has been to make natural selection a reason for everything - for all the actions in the world, as well as all the actors. By the end of the book, even the colours of the leaves on autumn trees around the grave of Bill Hamilton have been given a meaning by evolution - they are so vivid in order to warn parasites that the tree is healthy enough to repel them. </p> <p>This kind of reasoning reveals two of the characteristics of the school that so infuriate outsiders. The first, and one of the foundations of its success, is a rigorously statistical approach. The individual simply does not exist from the point of view of natural selection. This is hard to grasp. Since we have evolved as members of a social species, whose fate is influenced by our places in the group, so we naturally take the world personally. Perhaps the deepest conflict between Darwinism and religion lies in Jesus's assertion that \"not a sparrow falls\" without God noticing and caring. Billions of sparrows must fall to alter the course of history by the width of one downy breast feather, says the evolutionist. This perspective has a morally disorienting effect. </p> <p>There was a slogan of the early environmentalists, that one should think globally and act locally. Where evolution is concerned, it should be turned on its head. Attempts to think about humans as a global species lead almost at once to disastrous global ideologies - Nazism, communism, fanatical atheism, or even the cloudy eugenic fantasies of Hamilton, whose fears were focused on hospitals, rather than on Jews, evangelicals or the bourgeoisie. Hamilton, though almost the most eccentric of the major figures here, is also one of the sanest and most lovable, because he really did regard himself as a member of the species he was studying. He never for a moment supposed that he himself could be freed from the tyranny of his genes. </p> <p>The leaves around his grave, however, if they really are the trees' message to gall wasps not to bother laying their eggs there, reveal another disturbing aspect of natural selection. This is that meaning comes into the world before anything that might be said to understand it. The relationship between the vivid red colour of the dying leaves, and the health of the tree that produces them, is neither arbitrary nor conventional. Obviously, neither tree nor wasp can think in any interesting sense. Yet they are exchanging information about the world, and they might be said to be processing it, since their behaviour is certainly affected by it. </p> <p>The corollary is that we must be doing the same, almost all the time. Our mental life is in this perspective almost entirely unconscious and emotional. Evolutionary biologists came late to the discovery that the heart has its reasons, of which reason knows nothing. But if their research tells us anything about humans, it is that we might some day be able to analyse and reconstruct the workings of the heart, and discover exactly what they are meant to do. It is a real triumph of Kohn's to have opened the hearts and unhidden the reasoning of the men that he writes about. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrew Brown's book In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite is published by Pocket Books.</p>"
