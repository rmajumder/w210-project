  "<b> Daily Mirror </b> <br> Editorial, October 1 <p> \"The news that Tony Blair is to have a heart operation comes as a shock. But not as big a shock as his announcement that he plans to carry on as prime minister for another five years ... </p> <p>\"For months there has been speculation, gossip and rumour about when Mr Blair would go ... Now he has revealed his exit strategy. He aims to continue to serve right through the next parliamentary term and only hand over as the following election approaches. That would give him at least five more years in No 10. And who knows what the political landscape will be like then ... </p> <p>\"His health might not allow him to [carry on] ... There will also be tensions within the government as ministers jostle for position in the race to be his successor. If Mr Blair makes the full five years he will have beaten the record of Margaret Thatcher, who managed 11 and a half. He will want that but, unlike her, he will also want to manage an orderly handover.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Telegraph</b><br> Editorial, October 1 </p> <p> \"Mr Blair's heart operation, together with his decision to step down at the end of the next parliament, is an earthquake which will alter the landscape of British politics ... The countdown to the transition of power begins today ... At the next general election, the electorate will know that the man it is being asked to confirm in office will, at some unspecified date, cease to be prime minister, probably sooner rather than later. Mr Blair is now a lame duck. </p> <p>\"This is a profoundly disturbing situation for a country engaged in a global war on terrorism, committed to a peacekeeping role in Iraq, in neither case with any end yet in sight. Mr Blair's continuation in office is by no means a necessary condition for the successful continuation of this conflict, but any abrupt change in leadership is liable to have an unsettling impact on the morale of the armed forces and the nation. Hence, there is a need for calm and continuity. Those who are jockeying to replace him would be wise to conduct themselves discreetly, or they will be punished at the polls.\" </p> <p><b> Peter Mandelson </b><br> Evening Standard, London, October 1 </p> <p> \"The announcement about his future ... shows maturity on his part, as well as some courage. Others in his position would have feared that they would be turned into a lame duck by saying when they planned to retire from the top job. Mrs Thatcher made a great mistake by refusing to acknowledge her own mortality. By allowing everyone to think she was prepared to go on and on, she drove the public and then her own cabinet into despair ... </p> <p>\"Mr Blair has deftly removed himself from the risk of history repeating itself. No one can now accuse him of 'doing a Thatcher'. Instead, if he is re-elected, he will be able to govern in relative calm, no doubt facing many tough pressures and difficult events but without these being accompanied by the sort of jostling we have seen during a lot of this year.\" </p> <p><b> James Blitz </b><br> Financial Times, October 1 </p> <p> \"The sight of a prime minister effectively announcing that he will stay in Downing Street until a specified date around four years hence - and then stand down - is simply unprecedented in British politics. Even the prime minister's closest acolytes believe he does not really intend to do such a thing - but fear it may smack of a certain arrogance. </p> <p>\"Mr Blair's inner determination to stay on, of course, should not be doubted ... [and] is buttressed by numerous other factors. The Conservatives ... are still not seriously challenging to be the next government. And while Gordon Brown this week earned a strong standing ovation at the conference that re-established his position as the second figure in the government, there is a string of cabinet figures who question whether the chancellor could win over middle Britain in a general election.\" </p> <p><b> Mary Ann Sieghart </b><br> Times, October 1 </p> <p> \"Why does he feel he needs a whole four or five more years? He will already have served for eight by the time of the next general election. Is not 12 years too long for any prime minister? ... </p> <p>\"Mr Blair is very fired up to finish what he has started. His second term has been somewhat of a grind, and he wants to have a chance, in a third parliament, to oversee his reforms to fruition. </p> <p>\"Mr Blair also believes that he is finally experienced enough now to do the job well. He has hardened in office, as he admitted in his conference speech. Whereas in his first term, the prime minister resiled from taking difficult decisions, lest they make him unpopular, he now has no such qualms - as his actions over Iraq showed. </p> <p>\"He knows there are hard choices to be made in the next term, particularly over pensions, welfare reform and the public services. Not having to face re-election, he would be even freer to do what he saw as the right - but possibly unpopular -thing. And increasingly, he fears that Mr Brown as prime minister would not be prepared to do so.\" </p> <p><b> Trevor Kavanagh </b><br> Sun, October 1 </p> <p> \"Will he seize the moment and call a snap general election in November? Why not? ... Mr Blair has nothing to gain by waiting another eight months ... </p> <p>\"The PM is utterly convinced he can win and win easily. So why wait? Most attractive of all from Mr Blair's point of view is that it would effectively cut a year off his overall premiership while still giving him a place in the history books. And, perhaps crucially, it would give him the authority finally to shape his government in exactly the fashion he wants. </p> <p>\"Mr Brown could be foreign secretary by Christmas - or out of the cabinet altogether.\" </p> <p><b> John Rentoul </b><br> Independent, October 1 </p> <p> \"My guess is that Mr Blair is keeping his options open ... He may not know whether he will want to fight the next election, but he wants to have that chance if events are kind to him ... </p> <p>\"The fact remains, though, that if Mr Blair resigned at any time before the election, the leadership election would resemble a coronation, despite John Prescott's insistence that 'we don't have coronations in Labour'. John Reid and Alan Milburn might want to stand to put markers down, but in order to stand they would need to be nominated by large numbers of MPs, who then might be cast into the outer darkness by the incoming prime minister. And to force Mr Brown to appoint them to important jobs, they would need to win lots of votes among MPs, party members and trade unionists.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Star </b><br> Editorial, October 1 </p> <p> \"Let's not be naive, his wish to carry on as Labour leader for a full third term is unlikely to be realised. He's made one big mistake by trying to choose a retirement date. Admitting he will quit after that will spark off a battle for his succession. </p> <p>\"From today there will be only one topic of conversation among Labour MPs - who will take over from Tony. He has made himself a lame duck PM - not through his health problems but by saying: 'I'm quitting.'\" </p> <p><b> Scotsman</b><br> Editorial, October 1 </p> <p> \"This is the second time Mr Blair has required treatment for his heart. He may well feel confident now about how long he can go on. But heart problems, particularly when there has been a recurrence, cannot be so easily dismissed, and especially given the circumstances that Mr Blair is in. </p> <p>\"The job of prime minister is the most stressful imaginable. It has involved particular strain over the past 18 months with the Iraq war and its traumatic political aftermath. No person in the post can convincingly maintain that such a position does not involve deep and persistent anxiety and stress. It is not likely to get less so, however much the occupant may wish it. And however robust the prime minister may feel now, he cannot possibly know what lies round the corner either on the domestic front or internationally. Fate can make a fool of the bravest of us.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Group of seven industrial nations last night called on Opec to pump more crude to remove the risk to the global economy from spiralling oil prices. </p> <p>At its meeting in Washington, the G7 backed proposals tabled yesterday by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for measures to tackle the recent instability in the global energy markets.</p> <p>\"Oil prices remain high and are a risk\", the G7 commmunique said. \"So we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices remain moderate.</p> <p>\"Second it is important consumer nations increase energy efficiency. Third it is important for consumers and producers that oil markets function efficiently and we encourage the International Energy Agency to enhance its work on oil data transparency.\"</p> <p>The G7 call broadly followed a four-point plan outlined by Mr Brown to deal with the threat. The chancellor called on Opec, the producers' cartel, to pump more oil. He also said the market needed better information about oil supplies, higher investment in new fields and all countries should push for greater energy efficiency.</p> <p>\"A global recovery is under way with growth stronger over the past year, but it remains uneven and still fragile,\" Mr Brown said. \"High and volatile oil prices pose a risk to the outlook, dampening consumer spending and company profitability.</p> <p>Mr Brown also brushed aside comments by the International Monetary Fund earlier this week about the fragility of the UK housing market and the need for the government to raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit.</p> <p>\"They [the IMF] are out of date,\" he said. The housing market had changed since the spring and the spending round in July had produced new fiscal forecasts for the years up to 2008. \"I don't think that's been taken into account.\"</p> <p>The chancellor said the fluctuations in the oil price between $10 a barrel and $50 a barrel in the past few years meant there was an urgent need to take both short-term and medium-term measures to make the market work more effectively.</p> <p>Despite the agreement by Opec to increase production, Mr Brown said it needed to do more. \"Opec must continue to take the necessary action to return oil prices to levels consistent with global prosperity.\"</p> <p>Opec countries have made it clear that they lack the spare capacity to respond to western calls for an increase in supply, blaming speculators for the doubling of the oil price since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in spring 2003.</p> <p>The chancellor said the answer to speculation was more and better information. \"A lack of transparency in oil markets and poor-quality information contributes to volatility and uncertainties.</p> <p>The Treasury proposals would see consuming nations and producers work together to devise a phased timetable for producing transparent, high-quality, timely and reliable oil market data, available to all. The World Bank and the IMF should have an enhanced role in encouraging \"better and more timely data\", Mr Brown said.</p> <p>The IMF said this week that lack of supply meant high oil prices were likely to persist for the rest of the decade.</p>",
  "It may have taken a few years to do so, but Russia's decision to ratify the Kyoto treaty on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions couldn't have come at a better time. At one stroke its decision has breathed new life into the protocol, which was widely regarded as being effectively in a coma since 2001. And by choosing to announce its decision this week, Russia's government has - unwittingly - put pressure on the developed world's two high-profile Kyoto refuseniks, the United States and Australia, which both happen to be in the middle of bitter election campaigns. <p>The Bush administration pulled the US out of participation in the Kyoto agreement in 2001, a precursor of the unilateralism that the US would exhibit on other issues. John Howard's government in Australia has long objected to the treaty. Both countries' involvement in Iraq has overshadowed other international questions, but Russia's move now puts Kyoto in the spotlight. </p> <p>By staying out, the US and Australia will be unable to benefit from the valuable economic resources created under the protocol. Russia is responsible for 17% of the industrialised world's carbon emissions, making it an important participant. By signing up to the treaty, Russia is able to join in with the trading structure set up under Kyoto. It can sell its surplus of carbon credits allowed under the treaty on the global emissions market now getting under way in London, a key plank in the Kyoto scheme to put a price on carbon emissions and use market mechanisms to reward countries which reduce them. While the scheme has its weaknesses, it is at least an attempt to do something tangible to cap the world's greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>Both the US and Australia will be locked out of the trading system until they sign up to Kyoto - with Australia, in particular, likely to lose out on investment as a result. The opposition Labor party in Australia and the Democrats in the US both support approval of Kyoto. In both close-run elections the environment could yet play a part - thanks to the Kremlin's change of heart.</p>",
  "More than 60,000 students returned to Leeds this week to discover a vast social experiment which aims to limit their \"takeover\" of scores of streets around the two universities. <p>Four square miles will become an exclusion zone for new student hostels and any further conversions of houses into student flats, if a planning inspector approves a package drawn up by the city council. </p> <p>The initiative is by far the largest attempt of its kind to tackle a growing national problem, caused by unprecedented, government-driven increases in the number of students, with little or no extra funding for housing them. </p> <p>Three areas of Leeds - Headingley, Burley and Hyde Park - have students forming more than half the population, creating lop-sided communities with knock-on effects on facilities such as schools. </p> <p>\"There is no personal animosity against students involved in this,\" said Richard Tyler, a retired academic who has campaigned for eight years to create a more mixed community on the hillsides of largely Victorian terraces overlooking the centre. </p> <p>\"Our problem isn't noise, litter or crime but a very large, very transient part of the population which isn't - hasn't the time to be - interested in the area where it lives.\" </p> <p>The evidence shows all over the wedge-shaped corridor north of the universities, which was described in an academic study five years ago as \"a student Shangri-la\". </p> <p>Buzzing with street life, the three inner suburbs also have miles of unkempt gardens and hedges round houses which fill and empty as the annual procession of tenants hurries through. </p> <p>\"Their life's elsewhere, inevitably,\" said Pauline Elliott, a retired school secretary who was born in Burley and has lived in the same street in Hyde Park for 43 years. \"They have such a huge big club in the shape of the universities, where they work and enjoy themselves. </p> <p>\"We're not fuddy-duddies objecting to young people having fun, but it means there aren't the families, the children, the fantastic community that there used to be.\" </p> <p>The problem has caused similar concern in Birmingham and Nottingham, and two conferences are planned this autumn in London and Leeds to brainstorm possible solutions and flag up the issue to government departments. </p> <p>Leeds has decided to press head with the country's first Ashore - area of student housing restraint - to test whether social engineering can have any effect. </p> <p>\"The big problem has been the market,\" said Dr Tyler, who took the drastic step of buying his neighbour's house seven years ago to let it to non-students as a way of keeping the community mixed. </p> <p>\"Landlords and student parents [who buy houses, let them to their children and friends and sell them on graduation] now outbid all other potential buyers. Perhaps the only weapon against them is this kind of planning restraint.\" </p> <p>Powers to exclude particular groups are highly unusual under planning law. But the exclusion zone has crucial backing in principle from the universities, which accept the virtues of spreading student housing more widely. </p> <p>\"Students bring a great many benefits to Leeds as a whole,\" said a spokeswoman for Leeds University. \"They provide a vibrant, cosmopolitan and multicultured environment. </p> <p>\"They regenerate parts of the city. They have obvious financial benefits. But we accept that some residential areas now have an imbalance between permanent and 'transient' residents, and that this has had detrimental effects.\" </p> <p>The university, along with its counterpart, Leeds Metropolitan, has been part of the consultative process leading to the scheme, although both made objections to details at public hearings last month. </p> <p>In particular, they are pressing for restrictions to cover all houses in multiple occupation, not just students, to avoid discrimination and ill-feeling. </p> <p>Students also accept the need for change, although with caveats that shoddy landlords are a more important target. Tom Wong, communications officer for Leeds University union, said: \"We're broadly supportive of Ashore but students must get a better deal on housing all round. It's about time everyone got together to ask the question: where are all the students going to live? </p> <p>\"The government is driving up the numbers and saying 'Don't worry, we'll organise your education.' But they don't seem to have thought about how we're going to be housed.\" </p> <p>Leeds city council, which changed in June from Labour to a Liberal Democrat/Conservative/Green coalition, has been thinking. </p> <p>Apart from Ashore, its strategy is to create Shangri-las at other points of the compass. Both Unipol, the universities' respected housing agency, and private developers have built or converted clusters of new student-only flats to the west and south of the city centre. </p> <p>These include brightly-coloured, angle-roofed blocks close to the lively central pedestrian precinct and a major site in Holbeck, where dereliction is gradually being turned into Leeds's new cultural quarter for media and arts businesses, plus cafes and clubs. But pioneering south of the River Aire, miles from the legendary Skyrack and Original Oak pubs in Headingley, is still seen as a tall order. </p> <p>\"Would the leader of the council, or lobbyists in Headingley, want their 18-year-old daughter to live in the new Holbeck 'student village', in a potentially dangerous area, with inadequate transport links and poor services? Perhaps not,\" said Tom Wong. </p> <p>Dr Tyler counters: \"The proof of this issue was clear at the Ashore planning inquiry. If students got together they could win all three council seats in Headingley ward. But they were the only interest group which didn't turn up to have their say.\" </p> <p> <b>'It's friendly, it just needs to be more mixed'</b></p> <p>Brian and Pauline Elliott were delighted when their new student neighbours moved in this week. It's been hit or miss over the past 10 years whether there'd be any sense of having real people next door, and this year it seems to be hit. </p> <p>\"We said hope you like it and this lad said, 'Great to be here and if there's ever anything we can do for you, just tell us',\" said Brian. \"That's great.\" </p> <p>But however well things go this year in Brudenell Road, where the Elliott's flower garden contrasts with mattresses dumped in a classic absentee landlord's student house two doors up, it is never going to be like a normal street. The contrast is specially strong for the Elliotts because they grew up here, playing cricket in the alley. </p> <p>\"Jimmy Love that played for Yorkshire was one of us - people always used to say what a straight bat he had and I can tell you why. There were two gardens, one each side, where they'd never give your ball back if you hit it over the fence. So that counted as being out and Jim was brilliant at avoiding them.\" </p> <p>The Elliotts might have moved out 15 years ago, when the big demographic change began, but they're glad they've stayed, and they are enjoying campaigning for a mixed community. </p> <p>\"It's the only thing we need,\" said Brian, whose old primary school, Royal Park, has closed because of a lack of local children. \"It's friendly here, lively and we're near the city centre. It just needs to be more mixed.\"</p>",
  "The forthcoming report by eminent ecclesiastics, chaired by Archbishop Robin Eames, Primate of All Ireland, is guaranteed an urgent readership. <p>Intended to address the manner in which the Anglican church is governed and has communion, it arises from the controversy surrounding the consecration of the openly gay Bishop of New Hampshire, Gene Robinson, and the threatened schism of some parts of the church, notably the self-described \"global south\". This largely excludes New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, all of which, I was taught, are in the south. Whatever the report says, the language matters. </p> <p>Is it possible to commit schism? Or is schism something that happens to you? Are not those threatening schism actually sectarian, and breaking away of their own volition? Robinson's consecration was within American canon law, and followed a valid electoral process. Those threatening schism are largely outside the US, attempting to impose their views upon it; opponents within the US are refusing democracy in a country that makes such a noise about democracy worldwide. </p> <p>Robinson's opponents would not want to be called sectarian because they claim the higher moral ground. For them, it is important to propagate the idea that they are the mother organisation, and their calls for discipline and sanctions are a matter of preservation and purity. </p> <p>The recent history of the Anglican communion is a linguistic battleground; words have been hijacked to mean what their users wish them to mean. The organisation Reform, for example, has a title resonant of forward-looking change, but was founded to resist change. The word \"reform\" reverberates with the English Reformation, the foundation of Ecclesia Anglicana, a settlement marked by a balanced use of scripture, reason and tradition, whereas the modern \"reform\" appeals almost exclusively to its particular narrow reading of scripture. </p> <p>Ironically, it is secularisation within an organisation that would lament secular dilution of Christian faith in society. This dissembling is adopted against the openness of people like Gene Robinson - or my former colleague Canon (now Dean) Jeffrey John - whose offence against what their opponents would call \"orthodoxy\" was to adhere to the ancient Christian virtue of truthfulness in all things. Reform and Forward in Faith both originated as resistance to the ordination of women, a forward-moving reform that overturned a 400-year exclusion. Now there's a contradiction. </p> <p>Perhaps most seriously kidnapped of all have been the words \"biblical\", \"orthodox\", \"traditional\" and \"scriptural\", all much beloved of people whom many might call \"fundamentalist\". Herein, of course, lies the rub. </p> <p>\"Fundamentals\" was first used in the US in the 1920s to describe a desire for clarity with regard to the fundamentals of religious life. Though then describing almost exclusively Christians, it became common currency when applied to the interpretation of Islam by Ayatollah Khomeini, shifted to strictly orthodox Jews and is now a term of abuse in relation to the Taliban and the insurgency in Iraq. It has developed from literal understanding of scripture to extreme action, intolerance (though scripture in all three faiths espouses the opposite) and self-righteous judgmentalism. </p> <p>In the same period, \"cleric\" has become a boo word with violent overtones, \"biblical\" now means an interpretation that is narrowly literal, and \"traditionalists\" oppose change from a date they select - misunderstanding Cardinal Newman's point that \"to live is to change, and to become perfect is to change often\". </p> <p>We all adopt words as shorthand, which is probably laziness more than anything else, so none of us is innocent. But we have come to the point where our linguistic usage is encoded, language has been kidnapped and hybridised such that truthful debate is impossible. The labelling on the packet endangers the Anglican church's inheritance of tolerance and breadth, and its mission - to seek after truth and find it - risks being wasted. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Very Rev Colin Slee is Dean of Southwark</p>",
  "A British man held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has alleged that he saw US soldiers kill two men in Afghanistan. <p>Moazzam Begg, 36, who has been detained for 2 years without charge or trial, complains in the first letter from a serving inmate to describe severe mistreatment of having suffered \"vindictive torture\" and death threats, and implies that he has made a false confession. </p> <p>His lawyers said yesterday that they believed he had been held in solitary confinement at the US military base in Cuba because he had seen the killing. He has had no contact with fellow prisoners since his arrival almost 600 days ago. </p> <p>Although former detainees have alleged that they suffered extensive abuse and torture at Bagram in Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo, mail from the camp is heavily censored. </p> <p>It is unclear why the Pentagon has cleared a document which makes such strong allegations of abuse. </p> <p>Mr Begg's letter, which is labelled as a supplement to an earlier statement, was written in July and forwarded to his legal team earlier this week. He wrote it after learning that he would be given access to a lawyer. </p> <p>The American lawyer who subsequently visited him could be jailed if she disclosed their discussions. </p> <p>In his letter Mr Begg, who comes from Birmingham, said that he was a law-abiding Briton who had never met Osama bin Laden or joined al-Qaida or other paramilitary organisations. </p> <p>He was arrested by Pakistani agents at his home in Islamabad and handed over to the Americans, who held him at Bagram in Afghanistan for a year and transferred him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in February last year. </p> <p>Mr Begg wrote: \"During several interviews, particularly - though unexclusively - in Afghanistan, I was subjected to pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torture and death threats - amongst other coercively employed interrogation techniques.\" </p> <p>He described signing a statement in early February 2003 \"under threats of long-term imprisonment, summary trials and execution\", and added: \"Interviews were conducted in an environment of generated fear, resonant with terrifying screams of fellow detainees facing similar methods ... </p> <p>\"This culminated ... with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness.\" </p> <p>Two deaths at Bagram airbase have been classified as homicides and the autopsies indicated \"blunt-force injuries\", but it is thought that Mr Begg is referring to separate incidents. </p> <p>The Pentagon said torture was prohibited at Guant\u00e1 namo Bay and that all \"credible allegations\" of abuse were investigated, but would not elaborate on whether it considered Mr Begg's claims to be \"credible\". </p> <p>It added: \"The United States operates a safe, humane and professional detention operation at Guant\u00e1namo that is providing valuable information in the war on terror.\" </p> <p>Mr Begg said he had not been allowed to see a chaplain or a lawyer, and that even letters from his eight-year-old child were censored. </p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, one of Mr Begg's lawyers in the US, said: \"It turns out he is a witness to the two homicides at Bagram. There is no other reason to keep him separate from the others.\" </p> <p>He called on the American government to declassify evidence of the deaths, and said he would file a legal demand on Monday to end the \"inhumane treatment\" immediately. </p> <p>He called on the British government to demand Mr Begg's immediate repatriation. </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, Mr Begg's solicitor, said: \"We are requesting that the UK government immediately takes this evidence of torture to the United Nations demanding that the USA is held responsible.\" </p> <p>Lawyers have begun a battery of legal actions on behalf of Guant\u00e1namo detainees and the authorities may have felt under pressure to disclose documents. </p> <p>\"The letter has either been let through by mistake or because someone in the US has a conscience,\" Mr Stafford-Smith said. </p> <p>Ms Peirce said she believed it could be \"the 100th such letter he has written\" and described it as a cry for help. She said it was intolerable that evidence from Guant\u00e1namo could be used to justify the continued detention of foreign nationals in the UK under anti-terror laws. </p> <p>Mr Begg's father Azmat said it was heartbreaking to read the letter, but added: \"I am surprised and proud that he has been held for three years and yet is still strong.\" </p> <p>He said he believed that after his son saw the deaths in Afghanistan, US soldiers put a gun to his head and said: \"Now it's you.\" </p> <p>William Hopkins, a consultant psychiatrist for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said anyone held in the conditions described could suffer a wide range of problems, including depression, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said that the government was continuing to press for the remaining Britons to be repatriated and had raised the concerns expressed by the detainees with the US authorities. </p> <p>It said: \"During welfare visits, Mr Begg has never alleged to us that he has been systematically abused at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in the way that is being suggested. </p> <p>\"Mr Begg has said that he was mistreated at Bagram and we have raised this with the American authorities who are investigating. We take all allegations of abuse of British nationals abroad seriously.\" </p> <p>In recent months the British government appears to have been stepping up pressure on the US to release its citizens. </p> <p>Three other Britons - Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar - and several British residents are among more than 600 men still held at Guant\u00e1namo. Five other Britons gave harrowing accounts of life in US custody after being released without charge earlier this year. </p> <p>In a report first published by the Guardian, three of them detailed repeated beating, humiliation and death threats.</p> <p><b>Extracts</b></p> <p>Moazzam Begg's letter is dated July 12 2004, and addressed to the military command at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He requests that it be copied to his lawyers and US and British authorities. </p> <p>\"After over two and a half years in the custody of the US military without charge and, by extension, without jurisdiction, I have yet to be afforded basic rights normally granted under the constitution of the US and international law. I therefore demand ... that I be released immediately and returned to my family. </p> <p>I expect logical and reasonable answers for the following violations and abuses: The exact purpose of my abduction, kidnapping and false imprisonment on 31st January 2002 ... Why I was physically abused and stripped by force, then paraded in front of several cameras ... The exact purpose for my incarceration in solitary confinement since 8th Feb, 2003.</p> <p>Any documents presented to me by US law enforcement agents were signed and initialled under duress ... During several interviews, particularly in Afghanistan, I was subjected to ... vindictive torture and death threats. </p> <p>The said interviews were conducted in an environment of generated fear, resonant with terrifying screams of fellow detainees facing similar methods. In this atmosphere ... was the compounded use of racially and religiously prejudiced taunts. This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness. </p> <p>I have maintained a compliant and amicable manner with my captors. </p> <p>I am a law-abiding citizen of the UK and attest vehemently to my innocence before God and the law of any crime - though none has ever been alleged. I have neither ever met Osama bin Laden, nor been a member of al-Qaida - or any synonymous paramilitary organisation, party or group. </p> <p>Neither have I engaged in hostile acts against the USA, nor assisted such groups in the same.

  "I can't keep up with all the awareness days and campaign weeks we have now. For all I know, it could be National Peanut Butter Sandwich Day, or Wear A Hat For Elderly Badgers Week. Hence I've only recently discovered that October 4 is World Animal Day; that's right, the world - not just Taunton or Godalming. The whole planet, and I still didn't notice. <p>Just in case it's passed you by, too, here's a potted history - World Animal Day was started in 1931 at a convention of ecologists in Florence as a way of highlighting endangered species, and has since expanded to take in everything from pet rabbits to beached whales. This year, there'll be an animal welfare roadshow in Singapore, awareness campaigns in Bhutan and Nepal, Kindness Clubs in Ethiopia and Ghana, and educational programmes in Malta and Cyprus. The Lithuanian Society for the Protection of Animals is promoting a Day of Compassion, urging people to refrain from hunting, fishing, vivisection and slaughter and to give the country's working animals the day off. </p> <p>World Animal Day is supported by animal welfare campaigning organisation Naturewatch, and its mission statement promises \"to celebrate animal life in all its forms\". The date is apt - October 4 is the feast day of St Francis of Assisi, a 12th-century ascetic who renounced a life of fun and frolics to embrace poverty, hang out with lepers, wear shabby clothes and live in a cave. He also preached to birds, delivered sermons to hares and rabbits that he'd released from traps, and talked to fish about God. He was probably mad as a kumquat. Nevertheless, St Francis is the patron saint of animals, and the environment and pets will be receiving blessings this weekend in his honour. </p> <p>I once went to one of these services (out of curiosity, you understand - my pets are not religious); we sang All Things Bright And Beautiful to a chorus of yelps and barks, and a very jovial vicar sprinkled holy water over the four-legged members of the congregation, including one very special hamster. How much more fun can you possibly have before 10 on a Sunday morning? </p> <p>Following in the undoubtedly shoeless footsteps of St Francis, the Anglican Society for the Welfare of Animals is holding an ecumenical service of animal welfare today at St Margaret's Church, Westminster - the theme this year is laboratory animals. Then, on Monday, there will be a rash of school assembly talks, cake sales, coffee mornings, high street collections, animal sanctuary open days and wildlife talks across Britain. One fundraising suggestion is to hold a workplace competition to match the pet with their owner. Great idea - wish I'd thought of that. </p> <p>World Animal Day has celebrity endorsement from Brian Blessed, Nell McAndrew, Jilly Cooper, Uri Geller and Twiggy, as well as cross-party support from MPs including Ann Widdecombe (\"As a keen animal lover, I welcome this excellent idea\") and Tony Banks (\"I cannot adequately express how strongly I feel the need to celebrate World Animal Day\"). The WAD website pledge board (<a href=\"http://www.worldanimalday.org.uk\">worldanimalday.org.uk</a>) is full of good intentions and plans from the worthy to the wacky. One group of teenagers has pledged to stop buying products tested on animals; some people are going to make an extra-special fuss of their pets (\"I will be nice to my cat,\" promises Richard, aged six); and others are going into shops to demand cruelty-free products (\"Hit the capitalists in the pocket!\"). One person is giving up Sunny Delight - I'm not quite sure how this relates to animals, but it's probably for the best. JW Whitehead from Swanage warns, \"I will be playing my accordion throughout the day at the pedestrian precinct in Wareham, Dorset.\" Must jot that one down in the diary. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:GuardianPets@aol.com\">GuardianPets@aol.com</a></p>",
  "John Kerry was yesterday widely declared the winner of the first presidential debate, after an aggressive performance left a scowling President George Bush sometimes groping for words. <p>It was, however, too early to tell whether the debate, at Miami University, would be enough for Senator Kerry to close the president's five to 10 percentage point lead in time for the election a month today. </p> <p>Polls by three networks, CNN, ABC and CBS, showed that viewers declared the Democrat candidate the winner by clear majorities of between nine and 16%. But the surveys also suggested the debate had so far done little to change voting intentions. </p> <p>Last night Mr Bush attempted to recover lost ground, attacking Mr Kerry's pledge in the debate that, if elected, he would call a summit to seek more international help on Iraq. </p> <p>\"I've been to a lot of summits. I've never seen a meeting that would depose a tyrant or bring a terrorist to justice,\" Mr Bush said. With him at a campaign rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, was Republican senator John McCain, who told the rally: \"My friends, a summit is not a plan.\" </p> <p>Presidential debates have historically taken days to work their way through the electorate as they are replayed and analysed in the media, but snap surveys entirely of undecided voters did show that a shift in Mr Kerry's favour was possible. </p> <p>Democrats capitalised on the event by circulating pictures of a sour-faced Mr Bush, scowling while he listened to his adversary. The image appeared on split screens in the homes of tens of millions Americans, as broadcasters defied guidelines banning the use of such reaction shots. </p> <p>\"What you saw was a president who was annoyed, angry and aloof. He clearly didn't want to be there, and he was slouched over his podium,\" Terry McCauliffe, the Democratic party chairman, said. </p> <p>Arguably, Mr Bush should have known better. The broadcast of similar reaction shots of Al Gore in the first presidential debate four years ago dominated coverage in the days after, sapping the Gore campaign and helping put Mr Bush in the White House. </p> <p>Mr Bush's facial antics aside, there were no fatal gaffes on either side in the course of the 90-minute duel, nor were there any outright winning lines. However, it was widely praised as one of the best presidential debates in recent history, vividly showcasing the divide between the candidates. </p> <p>They differed sharply on whether the Iraq invasion had been justified - Mr Kerry declared it a \"colossal error of judgment\" - and on whether the US should do more to assure international support for pre-emptive military action. The Democratic senator said such action would have to pass \"a global test\" in which \"you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons\". </p> <p>Mr Bush declared himself baffled by the phrase \"global test\" and said: \"My attitude is you take pre-emptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.\" </p> <p>His strongest moments came on the attack, when he argued that Mr Kerry did not have the determination to project US leadership abroad. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest point scored against the senator came from the moderator, journalist Jim Lehrer. Echoing a famous Kerry remark from the Vietnam era, Mr Lehrer asked if he thought US soldiers were dying for a mistake in Iraq. Mr Kerry said they were not, and Republicans pounced on the apparent inconsistency. </p> <p>\"He said the war was a mistake, but he also said he was not asking American soldiers to die for a mistake,\" Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, said afterwards. \"How can you go to the allies and ask them to go in there, if you're saying it's the 'wrong war'?\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>PStwo</strong></p> <p>Not content with virtual ownership of the global console market and dismayed by sales that are finally starting to slow down, Sony has a plan to get even more consumers to buy a PlayStation 2. Much as the original PlayStation was revamped into a smaller, bar-of-soap style children's bedroom accoutrement renamed PSone, its younger brother is soon to get a similar makeover in the shape of PStwo. At 2.8cm thick and 75% smaller, it also comes with a built-in network adaptor for online gaming. Pretty much the only downside is that your old multi-tap (allowing you to connect four joypads) won't work. If you already own a PlayStation 2 it might be hard to justify this purchase, which is a shame, because once you've seen one you may find it hard to leave the shop without it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Out Nov 1</p>",
  "<p>For the past quarter of a century I have been hoarding, saving and protecting my collection of Matchbox cars. There are about 80 in total, in varying condition. Many, had they been life-sized, would have been scrapped, cubed and crushed. But I've kept them, and the reason I kept them was that one day I hoped to be able to pass them on to my son, who could then spend his entire youth playing with them, as I had. Sadly, this was not to be, as a so-called \"friend\" of the family gave my son for his third birthday a prepackaged \"collection\" of 75 cars, which cost \u00a39.99 from the supermarket. It took me 10 years and a sum roughly equivalent to \u00a31m in today's money to amass my collection. My son doesn't need it now so I have decided, through the pages of Guardian Weekend, to bequeath it to the nation. </p> <p><strong>Mercedes Benz 220SE</strong><br> Of all my collection, this is the car with the most things that opened. The boot opened, the front doors opened and the bonnet also opened, revealing the engine. Normally, you only got one of the three: boot, doors or bonnet. To get all three was a bonus, but you did begin to wonder about the structural integrity of the vehicle. This car also had headlights that looked as if they were on - except in the dark, when they looked off. Sadly, the car was held back by its final feature, which was steerable wheels. When I say steerable, they were steerable in the supermarket trolley sense of the word, in that they had a mind of their own. This made driving extremely difficult and it was an absolute non-performer on Hot Wheels Track. On the other hand it did appear to have independent suspension on every wheel, which seemed, and still seems, an unnecessary luxury for a Matchbox car. But then it wasn't a Matchbox car. It was an Impy Supercar, which is a company I've never heard of. They probably put all their research and development budget into this one car and then went under. </p> <p><strong>MG 1100</strong><br> This is the second oldest car in the collection and, strangely, also in the best condition. I did actually have one older than this. It was a VW Fastback, which my father gave me because he had the grown-up version. I don't remember much about Dad's car except it was the only unreliable VW ever built and starting it required getting into your best business suit, turning the key 18 times, then crawling underneath it to hit it with a hammer. Maybe I'd built up some resentment against the car because I remember deciding to turn my own model into a convertible. The surgery was badly botched and the VW ended up in the garden, the graveyard of Matchbox cars. In comparison, this MG 1100 was everything products of the British car industry should have been: long lasting, beautifully engineered and a pleasure to drive, especially on carpets. The MG 1100 has a dog on the back seat, recognisably a collie. The man driving also has on a V-neck sweater. I believe wearing a V-neck sweater was part of the requirement for passing your driving test in those days. </p> <p><strong>Sand Drifter</strong><br> I found this Hot Wheels Sand Drifter at the bottom of a swimming pool in Austin, Texas. We were taken out there by my father, who then left us for weeks at a time to swim and feed ourselves on the native food, which, as far as I can remember, was Dr Pepper and Peppermint Patties - mints the size of your head. The pool was called Deep Eddy, which is a fantastic name for a swimming pool (I believe it was named after a local philosopher). Deep Eddy was outside, which was nice in that you were in the midst of nature, but not so nice in that a lot of nature ended up floating on the surface. Many a time I would swim an impressive width to find I had a mat of maple leaves on my head and some of the world's scariest insects attached to my little English trunks. I don't know what the Sand Drifter was doing at the bottom, but my guess is that its previous owner was testing its all-terrain capability. Or maybe he accidentally let it drop and then couldn't see it on the bottom because of the thick mat of maple leaves on the surface. The originally orange Sand Drifter received a nasty green paint job when it, and several similar vehicles, were called up for military service shortly after my return to England. </p> <p><strong>Nissan Laurel 2000SGX</strong><br> Due to some fierce weight restrictions imposed by my parents on our trip to Texas, I was forbidden to take my burgeoning Matchbox car collection. At one stage, they suggested I could take my one favourite car. I suggested in return that they might like to take their one favourite child. I think this response had my pocket money docked for a month and my luggage allowance halved. (My father started docking our pocket money before he started giving us pocket money, so that by the time it started we were very badly in debt.) At that time, much of America hadn't woken up to the joys of Matchbox cars and young Texan boys had to wrestle calves into the dust rather than parallel-park lines of small cars (there's a lesson there somewhere). I eventually stumbled on a shop that had two cars for sale, neither of which I recognised from British roads. The one I chose was the Nissan Laurel 2000SGX, made by Yatming of Hong Kong. This was the first Japanese car in my collection and I had inadvertently caught the first salvo in the Japanese assault on the world car market. Significantly, it's still in beautiful condition and running like a dream. </p> <p><strong>Freeman Intercity Commuter</strong><br> My brother Ralph was older than me by one year and one month. In his 13 months head start, he perfected nearly all the skills required in ruthless capitalist exploitation. When I was old enough to be ruthlessly exploited, he instituted a \"game\" called trading, in which he would trade an Opal Fruit for one of my prized possessions. Lime was my favourite Opal Fruit and he would take advantage of this by offering me two limes for something like my bed. Before I was very old, everything I owned he owned. As soon as a trade was complete, out would come the Humbrol enamel paint, and on my prize thing would appear, \"This belongs to Ralph Browning.\" This would make trading things back out of the question, especially as one of the early trades secured him my collection of Humbrol paints. It's therefore a complete mystery how my brother's Freeman Intercity Commuter came to be in my collection. I can only assume he thought he was getting a very good deal indeed. The price would probably have been something like one of my kidneys. The vehicle itself seems to be a very good-looking prototype for an Espace-style MPV. I've never seen one in real life, so it was clearly far too ahead of its time. As was my brother, who now lives in a self-sufficient commune in north Wales making up for past capitalist crimes. </p> <p><strong>Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow</strong><br> My Uncle Victor was a dentist and clearly had money because he drove a Jaguar. I don't know whether it was my birthday or whether he was feeling particularly flush after some private crowning work, but either way he bought me some Hot Wheels Track, which every boy needed to race his cars on. I say \"some\" advisedly, because my father's policy, had we been rash enough to lash out on Hot Wheels Track, would have been to buy one piece first and see how we got on with that. Uncle Victor took me to Howse's model shop in Oxford, which had for sale more Matchbox cars than I had ever seen in one place. Shockingly, Uncle Victor also said I could have the car of my choice to go with the track. I plumped for the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, thinking that it would probably be more expensive than all the others and that Uncle Victor wouldn't notice. I also remember that the man behind the counter said I had expensive tastes. This confirmed me in my decision. You'll notice that the Rolls-Royce is in relatively good condition. That's because shortly afterwards it disappeared into my brother's under-the-bed storage facility and stayed there for the next 20 years. </p> <p><strong>Mercury Station Wagon</strong><br> This car was the biggest in my collection. It was clearly an American car at the time when American cars were seeing how big they could get and still fit on one side of the road. Where the MG 1100 had one dog, this had two hanging out of the back window. About four years after I acquired my Mercury I found myself right in the back of one with Amy Talbot from the local youth club in Austin, Texas. This youth club was incredibly wealthy and had better resources than most schools in Britain. Every other week we would go on an outing which you'd normally have to pay a top travel agent to arrange for you. This particular trip necessitated a short drive (400 miles in Texas). The youth club leaders sat in the front of the Mercury and some half a mile back I lay down with Amy Talbot in the luggage area (no dogs) and attempted to improve my carnal knowledge. That car was so big I'm pretty sure that our youth leaders knew absolutely nothing about it. Mind you, given the size of the front seat they were probably doing exactly the same thing. Amy Talbot is now a Southern Baptist minister campaigning for young women to remain chaste for as long as possible. </p> <p><strong>Mercury Cougar</strong><br> A neighbour of mine actually has one of these standing in his drive. A life-size one (he's sad, but not that sad) which he drives to his mother's every Christmas and returns courtesy of the AA. I should make it clear that the model I have is actually a stand-in for one of my all-time favourite cars. The original was stolen by my best friend for three and a quarter years, Jonathan Winter. In those days, young boys used to race cars against each other, especially if there was a lot of Hot Wheels Track available. Cars were displayed, swapped and, if there were despicable little toerags like Jonathan Winter around, stolen. Of course, he never admitted to stealing it, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back, minus one Mercury Cougar. For obvious reasons, our friendship ended shortly afterwards and I am pretty certain that if he is not in some crack house now, Jonathan Winter will be banged up for theft and, if the judge did his job properly, some pretty underhand moves at Subbuteo as well. </p> <p><strong>Ford Transit Caravan</strong><br> I stole this one from my friend Paul Chance. It was a dormobile, which was a type of vehicle I hadn't come across before, and I needed to take it home for some serious road testing. Interestingly, despite having the drag coefficient of a masonry brick, it was one of the fastest cars in the Hot Wheels Track events we staged all the way down Paul's sloping drive. The Ford Transit had opening doors at the back, which revealed a very well-appointed kitchen and living space. There was also a little removable rambler, which we took great pride in running down with our Land Rovers and Sand Drifters (I'm sorry, that's completely made up). Looking back, what I should have stolen was one of Stephen Willet's blue Ford Cortinas. Firstly, this would have enhanced my range of Fords and, secondly, it would have reduced Stephen's huge number of blue Ford Cortinas. He must have had seven or eight of these, all identical, and I never found out why. Even now when I'm trying to be adult and philosophical and address the great questions of life, it's still the great mystery that haunts me. </p> <p><strong>Leyland Pipe Truck</strong><br> This lorry had plastic pipes on the back, obviously all long gone. The Leyland seemed to be the only lorry Matchbox made, because I also had a Leyland dumper truck, a Leyland petrol tanker and a Leyland lorry with a wooden cabin on the back. Maybe these were the only lorries around at the time. They certainly had a very pleasing mien and an attractive configuration of wheels. What they didn't have was any sense of proportion. This pipe lorry was slightly smaller than the Ford Zodiac and, if it had been laying pipes of the same scale, someone, somewhere would have been very short of gas. As a boy, I was quite sensitive about scale (don't read too much into that) and I simply couldn't allow these dwarf lorries to be in the same game as normal-size cars. The net result of this was that the lorries didn't get out much as greasy spoon lorry park at dawn isn't much of a game. Neither were they stolen much, which explains why I still have so many good-condition Leyland lorries in my collection. I suppose the big question is, \"Where did they all come from in the first place?\" </p> <p><strong>Ford GT</strong><br> There was a brief period in my life when my belief in Father Christmas was waning and my belief in Matchbox cars as the ultimate guarantor of personal happiness was emerging. At Christmas during my childhood we used to wake up and find a stocking on the end of our bed. I know the pampered youth of today have pillow cases and bin liners at the end of their beds, but we had a stocking equivalent to a shoe size of about four, slim fitting. In it we generally had a new face flannel, a toothbrush and a tangerine. There might have been other items unrelated to the relentless push to improve our hygiene/vitamin levels, but they escape me. This all changed one year when I found the glorious Le Mans-winning Ford GT in my stocking. My first thought was that Father Christmas might actually be Uncle Victor, but my father soon talked me out of that. Sadly, shortly after getting it, I pranged one of the wheels, so what should have been one of my fastest cars became a sort of ornament, admired only for its fine lines. </p> <p><strong>Ford Zodiac</strong><br> In the same year I received the Ford GT in my Christmas stocking, my brother got a green Ford Zodiac. There must have been a commercial tie-up with Ford that year. My brother was quick to point out that the bonnet of his Zodiac opened, whereas nothing did anything on my GT. He pointed this out a lot, probably because my car was a lot cooler and, to my certain knowledge, no Ford Zodiac had ever won Le Mans. Even more remarkably, according to Ralph, under the bonnet of the Ford Zodiac was a removable spare tyre. This, of course, meant it was removed once and lost. Opening bonnets were quite a hit in those days and we spent many happy hours playing hard shoulder, where Ralph's Ford Zodiac would sit on the hard shoulder with its bonnet up and spare tyre missing, until my crippled Ford GT slewed off the motorway into the Zodiac, killing all its occupants. The bonnet came off altogether some time later and the Zodiac lost some of its cachet. It joined my collection shortly afterwards in return for my beloved Raleigh Tomahawk bicycle. </p> <p><strong>Trailer Caravan</strong><br> My son, who as we speak is happily playing with his 75 rubbish models of unidentifiable modern cars on which nothing opens anywhere, has a passion for trailers. He refuses to play with a tractor unless it's towing something and doing some useful work. I suspect he thinks a trailer is a unit and anything less than that is suspiciously incomplete. Anyway, this slightly odd notion must come from his mother's side because it's not something I share. Take, for example, this caravan with the detachable roof and detachable living accommodation for four. Had it been worth playing with, its detachable bits would now be in that great detachable parts bin in the sky. The fact that it's still in one piece, or three pieces, just shows how little play action it got. It was used as a mobile command and control centre for difficult traffic management situations, but it saw precious little towing. One of the reasons for this is my strong ethical reservation about the Matchbox policy of putting towbars on unsuitable vehicles. For example, you didn't buy a Lamborghini to find that it was fully equipped for towing caravans or horseboxes. Despite my personal reservations, it's the one item in my collection I am going to bequeath to my son. He'll know what to do with it.</p>",

  "<p>It was my colleague Colwyn Trevarthen who told me: \"You've got to read this book.\" We were having lunch in my Edinburgh oasis, the Phenecia. Colwyn is a pioneer of psychobiology, a free spirit and a mentor to me in my interest in music, the body and the brain. \"It's set in 19th-century Burma,\" he said, \"but it's completely modern and true.\"</p> <p>The Piano Tuner is the evocative first novel of young American biologist Daniel Mason, now a medical student. Set in the late 1880s, it is the story of a British officer stationed in the Shan States, who makes peace through cultural action and the practice of music and medicine. To the dismay of his senior officers, he first demands delivery of an Erard grand piano, and then a piano tuner. The book follows the tuner's journey from a misty London to the imaginary jungle paradise of Mae Lwin, on the borders of Burma and Siam, where he falls both in love and into intrigue.</p> <p>What Colwyn may not have anticipated is that, as I read the book, it began to \"sing\" back to me. I was taken by the idea of an opera about tuning, the long shadow of JS Bach that falls across the book, the emotional and musical journeys through cultures and continents, and a focal point of intimate human experience on a vast, colourful canvass. I was discussing possible opera projects with Michael McCarthy and Michael Rafferty of Music Theatre Wales at the time; they liked the idea, Mason gave permission, and, luckily, Amanda Holden agreed to write the libretto.</p> <p>Operas should not be Trojan horses. I plead guilty to having written agitprop operas (for example Sarajevo for Opera Factory in 1994, or Evropa for the National Theatre, Sarajevo, in 1995), but I hope I have always made it clear to audiences what they were letting themselves in for. Opera is a sensitive, empathetic space; in my mind it is dishonest to invite people in and preach to them without consent. I hope The Piano Tuner may be enjoyed as a sermon-free zone. But Mason's book raises questions about music that stand independently of the opera. Can music heal? Can music and culture make peace?</p> <p>These questions occupy me very much in my life as a musician. I do not believe music can heal in the sense that mainstream medicine can, but I believe it can be therapeutic and can transform. Most of us experience this when we use music to relax, energise ourselves, or change our mood. There is also the well-documented experience of clinical music therapy: for example, music may help children with autism to understand and communicate emotion; it may help older people in certain phases of Parkinson's to coordinate their movements. Music here is not a cure in the traditional sense; it is a way of reducing, and sometimes eliminating symptoms.</p> <p>My own special interest in music therapy at the moment is in the use of music to help children traumatised by war. The work began almost by accident. Early in 1993, I began to visit Sarajevo, a city I knew quite well before the war, principally for political and human rights purposes. I was horrified at the plight of children in the medieval siege of a modern metropolis, and discussed the idea of bringing children together for creative activities with a number of artist friends in the city, in particular the painter Edo Numankadic and the poet Goran Simic. I was heartened to discover that they had been thinking along the same lines.</p> <p>So we began a sporadic programme of creative workshops, bringing children together in cellars and other safe places, first in Sarajevo, then in Mostar. The work began as \"fun\", a simple distraction. But there were strong reactions from the children, an almost palpable wave of energy, as if something very powerful was being released. I believe music assists these children, helping communication between individuals and within groups, creating trust, joy, safety, cognitive repair and the incomparable self-esteem brought by creativity. To this extent, in my experience, the piano tuner is right.</p> <p>The second big question is, can culture and music somehow be agents for making peace? Modern conflicts are managed by power mongers and mafias. But as with healing, I know music may alleviate the symptoms of conflict, and may, in a humble way, be preventive. Daniel Mason's story of how British officer Anthony Carroll saved his skin in a bandit attack by playing a Shan melody on his flute is not far-fetched. I have had similar, less dramatic experiences when I have tumbled into unpredictable paramilitary company, and ended up taking out my guitar and singing songs. Music is an ancient machine for empathy. In our evolution as human beings, it seems likely that some form of \"musical\" vocal expression preceded language as a means of understanding the emotions and motivations of others. It should be no surprise, therefore, that it continues to bring us together and tell us profound things about one another.</p> <p>In my research for The Piano Tuner, I came across the writings of Sir George Scott, assistant political officer to the British Expeditionary Force to the southern Shan states in 1886, and later colonial administrator for the region. Scott was a paradoxical figure, and possibly a model for Carroll. Born in Dairsie in Fife in 1851, he was a diehard empire man, but, on the other hand had, a formidable grasp of the languages and history of the region. He also had a profound respect for, and understanding of, Shan culture. However questionable the justifications for the bloody occupation of the Shan States were, there was clearly a sound basis of cultural knowledge and strategy available, which assisted the peace officers in implementing a reasonably effective programme on the \"morning after\". The preventive cultural programme for conflict is a simple one: it is cultural practice and cultural education, leading to knowledge, social empathy and effective collaboration and action.</p> <p>I may be easily dismissed, either as an ivory tower academic or a mad musician, but I have served my time among the bullets and the squalor of more than one contemporary conflict. To me, it seems increasingly clear that, in situations of human need, politics and economics have somehow lost their power to transform. In the globalised world, perhaps they have become, like the bureaucracies they now spawn, systems more concerned with their own survival than the service of others.</p> <p>But culture is alive and well, if sometimes ignored and marginalised, and my experiences of life in the misery, mud and deprivation we have contrived to manufacture in the world suggest cultural action remains the only real transforming and redeeming force available to us. In an increasingly autistic international political environment, culture in the sense of what we know and create is our only hope of regenerating social empathy - the ability, for example, to understand why so many young Muslims mistrust western democracy, or to recognise the difference between murderous terrorism and desperate opposition in the cause of justice. Once again, as Trevarthen suggests, Daniel Mason, Anthony Carroll and his piano tuner may indeed be closer to a contemporary truth than may appear in the conventional received wisdom.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Piano Tuner opens on October 8, at the Linbury Studio, Royal Opera House, London (Box office: 020-7304 4000) then tours.</p>",

  "Slowing down is hard to do. Now another blow has been struck at the lazy life. A whole swathe of channel ferries that made the long crossing to western Normandy and Brittany are being cut. And with them go the long, lingering pleasures of being at sea with all the extended expectation of arriving in a new country. What excitement the five-year-old Mary Queen of Scots must have felt when she stepped ashore at Roscoff in westernmost Brittany on her way to marry the Dauphin. And with what different excitement the fleeing Pretender landed there after his failed pitch for the English throne. But arriving by sea in Roscoff may soon be a pleasure lost to us all, at the very moment when more of us have the time to take it slowly. <p>Crossings to Cherbourg, Caen and Le Havre may take a mere four or five hours, but that too is long enough to savour the pleasure of the journey, the romance of it all. The noisy loading at the quay, the slow unwinding that comes with the throb of the ship's engines, the gorgeous splash of the sea in the ship's wake, the call of the seagulls, the long view of England's green coastline, the sense, above all, that we are an island and an island people still. </p> <p>But in the frantic rush to be there, to arrive, to get the journey over and done with, ferries are losing out to the rail link and cheap flights. There's little sense that the journey can be part of the pleasure in its own right. The new tilting trains have cut some 20 minutes from the scheduled time on the London to Manchester route. I had the chance to try it out: luxury, indeed. Standard class is so commodious we felt we had fetched up in first by mistake. But as for the time saved, what kind of gain is that? Whose life is so significantly improved by being at a meeting, in a conference, fixing a deal 20 minutes earlier? You might instead have been deep into a good book, or catching the transient beauty of the countryside, or, say, the sun breaking from behind clouds. But, no, those in pursuit of careers, would, even on a train, be deep into laptop calculations or noisy planning on their mobiles. </p> <p>It's different for those of us on the cusp of work and retirement. We're learning to give up the hustle and bustle of the highways and enjoy the less frantic pleasures of the byways. The clock ceases to be such a tyrant. The step slows to a saunter. It is the time to be, rather than to do. This has practical consequences for me. In my rushing lifestyle I would always grab the quickest way to get around, one that allowed me to continue working for all but the minutes it takes to move from house to taxi, from taxi to destination. More and more, I get around London by bus and tube. My freedom pass allows me free travel the length and breadth of the city and I get the exercise of walking to the station and bus stop. So by opting for less speed I am benefiting both my pocket and my health. Of course, I'm familiar with the torture of rush-hour crowds, but slowing down means I travel out of peak hours, and some parts of the tube are getting better. There's good busking, too. </p> <p>Slow is already a growing movement. The notion of slow food goes back to a campaign begun in Italy to protect the pleasures of the table against the depredations of fast food. It's no accident it all began in Italy. The Journal of the American Medical Association recently hailed the Mediterranean diet as beneficial to the elderly. Along with the wise choice of foods goes the habit of eating at a relaxed pace, making the meal an event among colleagues or family, and reducing the need for constant snacking. I'm signing up for such habits myself. </p> <p>So how else do I plan to slow down? One way is always to turn up early. There's nothing as exhausting as rushing to be on time, the sweaty panic, the mislaid papers, the careless clothes. Turn up half an hour early for the train, and there's time for a coffee. Arrive in good time at the theatre or concert hall, and there's time to read the scholarly programme notes that come too late once you've seen the production or heard the music. </p> <p>As to journeying to France I predict the cross-channel routes will make a comeback as luxury outings. Decked out with gourmet food, on-board lectures, bookshops and luxury goods, they will be as much fun as the Orient Express in conjuring up how things used to be. And make us feel an island once again. All in view of the white cliffs of Dover.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:joan.bakewell@virgin.net\">joan.bakewell@virgin.net</a></p>",
  "<p>IMG, the sports and celebrity management group that lists Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova and golfer Tiger Woods among its clients, was yesterday sold for $700m (\u00a3390m). </p> <p>The company hired the investment bank Rothschild last year to review options for the business after the death of founder Mark McCormack. </p> <p>It is being acquired by New York buyout specialist firm, Forstmann Little &amp; Co. The business is being bought from McCormack family trusts as well as the family of vice-chairman Arthur Lafave. </p> <p>McCormack, who died in May last year, began the company in 1960 when he agreed to represent the golfer Arnold Palmer. </p> <p>He built the business into one of the world's leading sports management companies, branching out into actors, models, musicians, writers and events management. The firm has revenues of about $1bn and also represents actors Liz Tyler, Elizabeth Hurley and opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa. </p> <p>The deal with Forstmann Little will give senior management of IMG an equity stake in the business. </p> <p>The McCormack family trust will also retain an interest in the company, although it was not immediately clear how large a stake it would be. \"Mark McCormack built IMG into a global brand that is in a class by itself,\" said Theodore Forstmann, senior partner at Forstmann Little. \"Nobody even comes close in client relationships.\" </p> <p>Robert Kain and Alastair Johnston will continue to serve as co-chief executives. </p> <p>The business, based in Cleveland, Ohio, has 60 offices in 25 countries, employing 2,200 people. </p> <p>In addition to being the world's largest athlete representation firm, IMG, through its broadcast division TWI, is one of the largest independent producers of televised sport and distributor of sports rights, including the Wimbledon tennis championships, Premiership football and the Olympics. </p> <p>Reports said that about a dozen private-equity investors competed in a three-month bidding war for IMG.</p>",
  "<p>According to America's Food and Drug Administration yesterday, news that Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug, could increase the risk of heart attacks or strokes, was \"not a total surprise\". Well, it was to the markets. </p> <p>Concerns that Vioxx, with annual sales of $2.5bn (\u00a31.4bn), might have serious side effects for users have been around for some years. The FDA forced the manufacturer, Merck, to amend its labels in the US in 2002 to warn of possible related cardiovascular problems. </p> <p>Still, when Merck announced it was withdrawing the drug yesterday shares in the company plunged 27%, wiping $28bn off the market value of the business. Perhaps investors have been taking happy pills. That at least would explain why there was any optimism surrounding Merck in the first place. </p> <p>Merck forecast a reduction in earnings this year alone of between 50 to 60 cents a share due to the withdrawal of Vioxx. Previous estimates had been for earnings of between $3.11 and $3.17 a share. That equates to a drop of almost a fifth. </p> <p>Like other big names in the pharmaceutical industry, Merck is facing a dry pipeline when it comes to top-selling potions. Its best selling treatment to fight high cholesterol faces the expiration of its patent in early 2006, when sales are expected to slump in the face of generic competition. </p> <p>The industry could now face the prospect of a new threat. </p> <p>Questions were being asked yesterday about why the FDA approved the drug in the first place. Some commentators noted that the FDA trials lasted just 12 months. The Merck trials only discovered problems after around 18 months of public use. </p> <p>The FDA was set up initially to monitor the effects of short-term medicines. The pharmaceutical industry has since shifted toward more profitable drugs that treat long-term illnesses, but the FDA has failed to follow. With cries yesterday that the FDA is too much in thrall to the industry that could mean longer and tougher inspections of new drugs before they are approved. That's obviously good news for consumers but arguably not a good reason to park money in drug company shares. </p> <p><strong> China's slow boat </strong><br> </p> <p> The United States has a whopping trade deficit. China has a massive trade surplus. China's currency is pegged to the dollar. You don't need to be a genius to work out that calls for Beijing will be on the menu when China turns up for dinner with the G7 in Washington tonight. In reality, the prospect of China bowing to American pressure for a revaluation of the renminbi is remote. One lesson learned by the global community over the past couple of decades is that China does things in its own way and at its own pace. And that pace tends to be slow. </p> <p>The case for action is powerful, and is summed up by one figure - America's $120bn trade deficit with China last year. Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF's new managing director, said yesterday that China should take advantage of its recent stupendous growth to start the process of moving to a more flexible exchange rate system. </p> <p>There are at least three obstacles in the way, however. The first is that China's fixed exchange rate is part of a complex system of capital controls and banking laws which have allowed the government to regulate its economy. As de Rato noted yesterday, China should not lose its ability to protect itself. The second is that Beijing has already taken steps this year to slow growth through credit controls and will be concerned that a revaluation would hit exports, a key component of China's recent success. </p> <p>Finally, the Americans need to be careful what they wish for. While the strength of the dollar has been bad for US exports, it has been good for US inflation, keeping the price of imports from Asia cheap. What is needed is not a snap revaluation of the renminbi, which could prompt turbulence on currency markets, but a managed and predictable process. That, of course, takes time, which is why any move is probably at least two years away. </p> <p><strong> Vulnerable figures </strong><br> </p> <p>As a nation, we have been mis-sold a bewildering array of financial products. Personal pensions, endowment mortgages, split-capital investment trusts and precipice bonds quickly spring to mind. Silvery-tongued sales advisers, no doubt motivated by commission, clearly had a large part in this. </p> <p>But statistics trotted out by Callum McCarthy, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, at a Reuters forum last night give pause for thought. </p> <p>Apparently, 23% of adults cannot get the name of a plumber from a copy of the Yellow Pages and over 20% fail to understand simple percentages. Little wonder, then, that Britons find it tough to decide which financial products are best for them. </p> <p>Lots of educational initiatives, beginning at school age, are now under way, but getting the masses to understand their finances could well take generations. As ever, the onus must be on the industry to chose simplicity over complexity. But it's also a reminder of the public's vulnerability when it comes to financial products - and the absolute unsuitability of commission-led sales.</p>",
  "<p>The banker being lined up to take over as head of investment banking for German bank Commerzbank was thought to be wavering last night. </p> <p>The appointment of Wolfgang Matis was scheduled to be made known to Commerzbank's staff today as the departure of Mehmet Dalman was officially confirmed. However, it emerged last night that Mr Matis, who is head of global markets for Deutsche Bank, may not take the position after all. </p> <p>Senior executives from Commerzbank were expected to make fresh efforts to woo Mr Matis overnight after they had landed in Washington for the IMF conference. </p> <p>If Mr Matis takes the job, he will be replacing Mr Dalman who started the investment banking business from scratch in 1997. </p> <p>Since then, Mr Dalman has become known in the City as the banker to Express owner Richard Desmond and adviser to Malcolm Glazer, the US investor who has amassed a stake in Manchester United. </p> <p>Mr Dalman is leaving Commerzbank, amid rumours of rows over strategy, to set up an investment management operation which will be known as WMG. </p> <p>The outfit aims to provide services to wealthy individuals, private banks and institutions who are interested in making investments in alternative asset classes such as hedge funds. It is expected to take two years to build up and is likely to make a number of acquisitions of established firms. </p> <p>Mr Dalman, a London educated Cypriot, is leaving a few weeks before the outcome of an external review by consultants Mercer Oliver Wyman which he commissioned. </p> <p>There is speculation that the review may lead to a scaling back of equity analysts at Commerzbank but to an expansion in services which would be needed to boost business with German small businesses such as loans and other capital markets activities. </p> <p>Mr Dalman is expected to take a number of senior Commerzbank bankers with him to his new venture. A number of top bankers have already left. </p> <p>Commerzbank would not comment last night on the status of Mr Matis, who is based in Frankfurt.</p>",
  "It seems that all I can really think about is the election and the enormous impact it will have on my country and the world. <p>I have always been politically involved, but this year I have been much more active in campaigning for the Democratic party in local, state, and national races. My political beliefs run slightly left of center, and from what I have seen, people are aligning strongly along their party lines. Politics are being spoken of everywhere and everybody seems to have very strong opinions and feels the need to share them. </p> <p>Even though I reside in a traditionally Democratic area, I have often found myself in the middle of heated debates pertaining to which candidate - Bush or Kerry - is the more capable leader. I am personally not a big supporter of Kerry, although I do believe he is a good, decent person, and would do a much better job than Bush in leading the country. </p> <p>Bush has had four years as President and has fallen short every step of the way-the war on terrorism, Iraq, homeland security, taxes, health care, the environment, stem cell research, gay rights, education, etc. I often ask some of my more conservative friends what they consider to be Bush's biggest accomplishment. I usually receive an answer along the lines that Bush has done the best he can in this day and age. That is not good enough for me. </p> <p>If, as a barometer, I ask myself, \"Am I better off than I was four years ago?\" The answer is no. I believe Bush does not believe in the same America I do, and I desperately want to see new leadership in this country. </p> <p>Which man did what in Vietnam means nothing to me, and I blame the media for focusing entirely too much attention on this matter instead of encouraging a real debate involving real issues. Kerry served admirably and is a war hero. Bush avoided a preposterous war, and I cannot say that I would not have done the same thing if I was in his position. </p> <p>Some of my liberal friends have said they want Bush to win re-election because they believe he will promptly run the country further into the ground and ruin whatever little credibility and legacy he has. I believe he will continue to lead this country down the wrong track if he is re-elected, and I believe that time will reveal him to be a poor leader, but Bush's re-election is something I will do my best to prevent.</p>",
  "A British citizen being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay was subjected to \"vindictive torture\" and death threats while in US custody, he claims in a letter published today. <p>Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, made the allegations in a four-page letter released uncensored to his legal team after being declassified by US officials - a development described by Mr Begg's lawyers as an \"oddity\". </p> <p>The handwritten letter, dated July 12 2004, described the alleged abuse he received at the US military base in Bagram, Afghanistan, prior to his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo and his first contact with a lawyer. He also claims he witnessed the alleged killings of two fellow detainees in US custody. </p> <p>\"During several interviews - particularly, though unexclusively in Afghanistan - I was subjected to pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torture and death threats, amongst other coercively employed interrogation techniques,\" the 36-year-old wrote in the letter. </p> <p>\"The interviews were conducted in an environment of generated fear, resonant with terrifying screams of fellow detainees facing similar methods. In this atmosphere of severe antipathy towards detainees was the compounded use of racially and religiously prejudiced taunts. </p> <p>\"This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness.\" </p> <p>Mr Begg, who has been at Guant\u00e1namo for almost two years, also claimed he has been held in solitary confinement since February last year and that, whenever he had signed any documents during his detention, he had done so under duress. </p> <p>He denied any involvement with al-Qaida or any \"synonymous paramilitary organisation\". </p> <p>\"I am a law-abiding citizen of the UK and attest vehemently to my innocence before God and the law of any crime, though none has ever been alleged,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Begg's British solicitor, Gareth Peirce, and his US counsel, Clive Stafford Smith, today published the letter at a central London press conference, and called for the \"immediate repatriation\" of their client.</p> <p>Ms Pierce said: \"Whatever excuses have been given in the past for our government here to not take effective action, now this direct testimony from Guant\u00e1namo compels them to do what they failed to do, which is to achieve his return to this country from his illegal captivity in the US.</p> <p>\"[He is] the one detainee who has not been seen by any of the others. We've had a number of men who returned earlier this year who've said the one detainee they can't describe is Moazzam Begg, and this letter makes clear why. It is that he's been held separately from the others. I would say it's because he's witnessed murder by the US. He has evidence of unlawful killing by the US military, and that evidence is clearly being suppressed.</p> <p>Mr Stafford Smith said the document was released either \"by mistake or because someone in the US has a conscience\". He said it would be deployed in their legal battle to get more information released about conditions at Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>\"It gives a flavour of what's really going on down there, and it's scandalous that the US authorities think they can go round torturing people and then classify the evidence of that torture,\" he said.</p> <p>The detainee's father, 65-year-old Azmat Begg, said: \"It is a very heartbreaking sort of letter. He must be a very brave boy, a very strong boy, because no ordinary man could cope with this.\"</p> <p>Mr Begg is one of four Britons being held without charge in the US camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The prime minister, Tony Blair, has personally asked the US president, George Bush, to free the British detainees. The detainees are scheduled to appear before special US military tribunals which will rule on whether they are \"enemy combatants\". </p> <p>Five of the nine Britons originally detained at Guant\u00e1namo were released without charge in March. </p> <p>One detainee, Tarek Dergoul, a 26-year-old former care worker from east London, said after his release that US guards had forced him to look at pornographic magazines and subjected him to \"very loud\" American music during interrogations. </p> <p>Mr Dergoul said he had suffered repeated strip-searches and sleep deprivation. During cell searches by guards wearing riot gear, the soldiers \"poked their fingers in my eyes, banged my head on the floor and kicked and punched me and tied me up like a beast\", he said in a statement released in August. </p> <p>The Britons who, along with Mr Begg, remain at Camp Delta, are Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar. </p> <p>In June the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith QC, said he was \"unable to accept\" Mr Bush's proposals for military tribunals at Guant\u00e1namo because they did not meet international standards for fair trials. </p> <p>The editor of Muslim News, Ahmed Versi, said: \"It is about time Tony Blair demanded the release of British Muslims incarcerated at Guant\u00e1namo Bay without charge. It's sad to see that our government has been silent about their torture, even though they have had the information on this for some time now.\" </p> <p>Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen, said: \"The US must now bring the shameful situation at Guant\u00e1namo Bay to an end. There should be a full and independent inquiry to establish who is responsible for any ill-treatment, at all levels in the US administration. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\"</p>",
  "<p>The case for leaving interest rates unchanged strengthened today as British manufacturing suffered a further loss of momentum in September.</p> <p>According to a key survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, manufacturing grew at its weakest pace in more than a year last month, with new orders slipping to their lowest levels since June 2003.</p> <p>The latest evidence of the fragile nature of the manufacturing recovery came on the heels of recent data on retail sales, consumer confidence and house prices, all showing signs of a weakening economy.</p> <p>\"The manufacturing sector has clearly lost momentum since growing strongly in the second quarter, affected by higher interest rates, strong oil prices, and at least a temporary slowdown in global economic activity,\" said Howard Archer, an economist with the consultants Global Insight.</p> <p>Mr Archer added: \"This is another reason for the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged over the rest of this year, although it will not be happy to have seen output prices rise further.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) has raised borrowing costs five times since last November.

  "After a summer that was spent debating Vietnam, the war in Iraq last night came to the campaign agenda forefront in dramatic fashion as George Bush and John Kerry debated foreign policy in front of an estimated 50 million television viewers. <p>Iraq squeezed out other pressing global concerns - including the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians - but the thrust of Mr Kerry's argument against Mr Bush was that it had \"diverted\" attention from the \"war on terror\" against Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\"Iraq was not even close to the centre of the war on terror before the president invaded it,\" Mr Kerry said. \"He rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush countered that Mr Kerry had also believed Saddam Hussein to be a threat, and asked him what kind of message was being sent out to US troops and allies if he said \"wrong war, wrong time, wrong place\".</p> <p>That set the tone for the exchanges. Mr Kerry would criticise what he saw as Mr Bush's mistakes - once accusing him of a \"colossal error of judgment\" - and the president would accuse the senator of sending out \"mixed messages\".</p> <p><b>Fitness to lead</b></p> <p>The question of fitness to lead framed the debate. The host, Jim Lehrer, began by asking Mr Kerry whether he could a better job than Mr Bush of protecting the US from another attack like those of September 11 2001. Towards the end of the 90 minutes, he invited Mr Bush to draw attention to any underlying character defect of Mr Kerry's that would make him unsuitable to be commander-in-chief.</p> <p>The president, after meandering through platitudes about how the senator had been a good father to his daughters, moved to his standard attack on Mr Kerry's \"mixed messages\".</p> <p>\"He changes position on something so fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages ... I know how this world works, and that ... there must be certainty from the US president.\"</p> <p>In answer to the first question - how he would protect the US from a terrorist attack - Mr Bush linked the conflict in Iraq to the war on terror. \"Our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer. We pursued al-Qaida wherever al-Qaida tries to hide: 75% of known al-Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know we're after them.</p> <p>\"In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realised that after September 11 we must take threats seriously before they fully materialise. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.\"</p> <p>Mr Kerry said he would keep the country safe by being \"strong and resolute and determined\" and \"smart\".</p> <p>\"Smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking it off to Iraq, where the 9/11 commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.\" </p> <p><b>The decision to go to war in Iraq</b></p> <p>Mr Kerry said he had voted in the Senate to authorise the president to go to war, but had believed Mr Bush when he said he said he would plan carefully, proceed cautiously and not make war inevitable or go without allies. </p> <p>Mr Bush denied he had gone to war without allies - naming Tony Blair and President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland - and quoted Mr Kerry's jibe at Howard Dean in the primaries that anyone who did not think the world was better off without Saddam Hussein did not have the judgment to be president. </p> <p>Mr Kerry responded by saying that the president had made a mistake in not building stronger alliances, and had gone to war before it was a last resort. \"There was a right way to disarm Saddam Hussein and a wrong way,\" he said. \"And the president chose the wrong way.\"</p> <p>The president then accused the senator of changing positions. \"You cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win,\" he said.</p> <p><b>What next in Iraq? </b></p> <p>Both candidates said they expected to win in Iraq. Mr Kerry said he had a four-point plan to win the peace - claiming that the president had none - and said he would call a summit of European and Arab nations who had a stake in a stable Iraq to build a real peace. </p> <p>He said he would make a flat statement that the US had no long-term designs on Iraq. Mr Bush said he would stand firm, that there already were summits on Iraq and that both US allies and the UN were now involved in Iraq. </p> <p>Mr Kerry asked why the US was sustaining 90% of the casualties and paying 90% of the financial costs of the war. Mr Bush said Mr Kerry could not win allies for the US in Iraq if he insisted on calling the conflict a diversion. </p> <p><b>Nuclear proliferation</b></p> <p>In a rare moment of concord, Mr Bush and Mr Kerry agreed that nuclear proliferation was \"the single most serious threat\" facing the US. Mr Bush said the AQ Khan network had been broken in Pakistan, Libya had voluntarily disarmed, and the US was one of five nations putting pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear programmes.</p> <p>He said Mr Kerry's plan to reopen bilateral negotiations with North Korea was a mistake, because that was what Kim Jong-il wanted. Mr Kerry said nuclear proliferation had increased under Mr Bush's watch.</p> <p>\"We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under Bill Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were. And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.</p> <p>\"And for two years this administration did not talk at all to North Korea. While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. And today there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.\"</p> <p>He said the US had not stopped Iran from building a nuclear programme, accusing Mr Bush of cutting the funding to neutralise unsecured nuclear material from the former Soviet Union to extent that it would now take 13 years to complete the job as opposed to the four he said he could do it in. Mr Bush countered that he had raised funding for other anti-proliferation initiatives.</p> <p><b>Darfur</b></p> <p>Mr Lehrer, introduced this topic while the candidates were debating proliferation. Both men began their answers by talking about Iran - Mr Kerry said the US needed to work with France, Britain and Germany for its sanctions to be effective, while Mr Bush said the sanctions on Iran had existed before he came to the White House.</p> <p>Both described Darfur as genocide, but shied away from committing US troops. Mr Bush promised more aid, and said the US should use African Union troops in Darfur, suggesting that - as had happened in Liberia - US troops could stabilise the situation and then move out. </p> <p>Mr Kerry said US troops could be used to \"coalesce\" the African Union to send soldiers, but said Washington could best help by offering logistical support, not just humanitarian aid.</p> <p>The senator said the Iraq war and a \"back door draft\" had overextended the US military, and said he would double the number of special forces and add two active divisions to the US army \"for our general demands across the globe\".</p> <p><b>In their own words</b></p> <p><b>Mr Bush:</b> \"I believe I am going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead. I've shown the American people I know how to lead [...] I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made. And I've made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe. And that's how it is best to keep the peace.\"</p> <p><b>Mr Kerry:</b> \"This issue of certainty. It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and wrong. What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem cell research or global warming or other issues. And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.\"</p>",
  "The World Bank and International Monetary Fund get-together taking place this weekend in Washington is one of the great annual gatherings of practitioners of a dismal science. <p>Finance ministers and central bankers from every part of the world, together with their teams of advisers, fill every luxury hotel in the American capital. </p> <p>In formal committee meetings, news conferences, seminars and informal get-togethers on the side, they will review the state of the world economy, map out the road to global poverty eradication and provide strategic direction to the twin pillars of the international development system. </p> <p>The meetings can have a restrained, technocratic air. This is strange, given the scope of the agenda and the scale of the international financial institutions' ambitions; the bank's slogan under its PR-savvy president, Jim Wolfensohn, is: our dream is a world free of poverty. Odd, too, amid the intense controversy generated by the institutions' loan conditions, </p> <p>The events are covered by a relatively small number of financial journalists, while the big protests of recent years are no more. The security around the bank and fund buildings on 19th Street may be tighter than ever - with a cordon extending two blocks in every direction, set up over the weekend. </p> <p>But this has more to do with al-Qaida than anti-globalisation activists. Indeed, the mounting costs of protecting a meeting room full of G7 finance ministers have led to the meetings being compressed this year. Both the development committee, whose remit covers the bank, and the international monetary and financial committee, which covers fund business, meet on the same day. </p> <p>The agenda for the IMFC, which is chaired by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, and assisted by Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, includes the global economic outlook (positive for most places outside Africa), the IMF's role in the poorest countries and a review of the \"IMF quotas, voice and representation\". </p> <p>The last item sounds obscure, but isn't when you realise the IMF and its sister bank operate on a \"one dollar, one vote\" basis. This gives almost total dominance to the north Americans, Europeans and Japanese. Britain, France and Germany each have their own seat on the board. Close to 1 billion Africans in 46 countries must settle for just two seats between them. </p> <p>Democratic it isn't. Everyone recognises the problem, but almost no one who can effect change seems keen on relinquishing control. </p> <p>One small shaft of light may come from Hilary Benn, the UK international development secretary, who sits on the development committee. I was told by one British official that Benn is frustrated enough by rich country procrastination over governance reform to \"do a Khruschev\" and bang his shoe on the table, which could be interesting.</p> <p>More substantive progress is possible on three other issues where the UK is taking a lead. </p> <p>First, Brown has proposed a scheme to cancel all the debt owed by the poorest countries to the fund and the bank, through extra aid money and sales or revaluation of the IMF's huge gold reserves - currently undervalued by $35bn (\u00a319.5bn). </p> <p>While a deal is unlikely this weekend - not least because the US has an alternative plan on the table - France and Canada are interested in the proposal. It is likely to be taken forward next year during the UK's chairing of the G7 group of industrialised nations. </p> <p>Second, the international finance facility, the chancellor's idea for doubling aid to poor countries to meet the UN's millennium development goals in 2015, will get the green light from the fund and the bank in a joint feasibility study released over the weekend. </p> <p>This will raise Britain's hopes of winning sufficient backing from other donor countries to launch the IFF at the G7 summit in Gleneagles next summer.</p> <p>Finally, the UK government will also launch a position paper on aid conditionality. This is the practice of requiring countries to undertake policy reforms, such as trade liberalisation and service privatisation, in exchange for aid money. </p> <p>Presenting the new paper, Benn will call for fewer conditions linked to structural economic change and a focus instead on basic financial accountability. It represents a significant challenge to how the bank and the fund operate in poor countries. </p> <p>For all the talk about \"ownership\" and \"partnership\", research by non-governmental organisations - and by the financial institutions' own evaluation departments - shows that loans and aid continue to be used to leverage controversial policy reforms that have often increased, not reduced poverty. </p> <p>If progress is made on all three of these issues, the meetings - which often produce little beyond lofty sentiments, coupled with inaction - will have proved a success. They will have laid a solid foundation for a major push on international development during 2005 when Britain not only chairs the G7, but also holds the presidency of the European Union.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Patrick Watt is Action Aid's senior policy officer</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday October 7 2004</b> <p>We say in the article below that the EU has taken command of the Nato-led peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Afghanistan. While this is true for Bosnia, the Eurocorps headquarters - which recently took charge in Afghanistan - reports to Nato, although it is available both to the EU and Nato.</p> <p></p> <p>The European Union's fledgling effort to develop its own military force is slowly taking shape on the dusty streets of the Afghan capital. But in the mounting insecurity which plagues the country as presidential elections approach next week, it is unlikely that many Afghans have noticed. </p> <p>So is it a case of great things having humble beginnings, or that nothing has really changed since August, when the five-nation Eurocorps, led by France and Germany, replaced Nato in commanding the international United Nations-mandated contingents who patrol Kabul? </p> <p>Tall, heavily-armed white men in flak jackets, tramping past crowded bazaars or rumbling in armoured cars through the heaving traffic of painted lorries and ancient taxis - who spots the difference between the EU and Nato? </p> <p>By the end of the year the EU will also have replaced Nato in charge of peace-keeping in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The same riddle of recognition will apply there, too, even though these two missions are touted as the most significant steps yet taken to put teeth into Europe's security and defence policy. In fact, they are both postwar, peacekeeping operations on a very classic model. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the EU's military activity has been more innovative, at least in terms of the mission's purpose. The EU went briefly into Macedonia to forestall a civil war at the initiative of the two main ethnic communities' leaders. Last year, with a UN mandate, it protected civilians and put an end to massacres and rape in the eastern Congolese region of Ituri. </p> <p>There was nothing here about regime change or mopping up after war. The troops were there to protect civilians and prevent disaster, or in the Congolese case, to put a stop to it. The EU has also organised two police missions to help local law-enforcement in the Balkans, and one in Georgia. </p> <p>The EU recently set up a command centre to plan European military-civil operations. In recognition that police are a key component of postwar nation building and conflict prevention, there is talk of creating a European gendarmerie. </p> <p>Yet, as the EU builds up a capability for military action, questions remain over the doctrine which its forces will follow. Are they simply pooling units from national armies under a joint EU command? Is it a mini-Nato with a European face, the much-vaunted European \"pillar\" of Nato, finally standing erect? Is the new force to have a different or just a separate approach from the Americans? </p> <p>At their Brussels summit last year EU governments agreed on a security strategy which went far beyond the issue of Europe. In contradiction to the appalling idea of Europe authorising asylum seekers' detention camps in north Africa, which European home affairs ministers are discussing again this week, it recognised that fortress Europe is unworkable and immoral. \"The post cold war environment is one of increasingly open borders in which the internal and external aspects of security are indissolubly linked,\" the strategy document says. </p> <p>Implicitly rejecting the Bush concept of military pre-emption, it calls for \"preventive engagement\", by which it means European action to help countries return to democracy, or build it, before military threats arise. </p> <p>How this can be done systematically is fleshed out in an important and imaginative new report, A Human Security Doctrine for Europe. Set up by Javier Solana, the European foreign minister, whose job was created under the new European constitution, the report's drafting committee was convened by Professor Mary Kaldor of the London School of Economics. </p> <p>The report avoids the issue of the EU's relationship with Nato, and whether EU security activities should complement or substitute for Nato. Nor does it get into the self-flattering debate about the United States as Mars and Europe as Venus. It points out that Europe's posture is just as Martian and outmoded as that of the United States. \"Europe has 1.8 million people under arms, but only a fraction can be deployed in crisis zones. Europe needs to be able to deploy more police, human rights monitors, aid specialists, and many other kinds of civilian expertise,\" it says. </p> <p>The report's core is a set of principles to guide EU military-civil missions. The first is the primacy of human rights. It is not enough that an intervention be legal. The methods adopted must be appropriate since protection of civilians is an end in itself. Under the doctrine, for Europe to adopt tactics like the current US airstrikes on Iraqi cities would be wrong and counterproductive since excessive use of force inflames a situation. </p> <p>More radically, the report calls for a bottom-up approach. Decisions about whether and how to intervene must take account of the views of the people affected by violence and insecurity. Once established on the ground, missions have to provide for consultation, dialogue, and partnership with local people. \"International interventions can never be more than enabling. There is a tendency among internationals to assume they know best. Conventional attitudes have too often been to do it for them or to work with weak or criminalised leaders,\" the report says. </p> <p>In a similar spirit, the report says that if the EU is going to act as a \"norms-promoter\" abroad, it has to conform to clear legal standards itself. There should be common rules of engagement for EU troops, and all deployed personnel should be subject to enforceable sexual codes of conduct, as well as the domestic law of the host state. The scandal of prostitution and child abuse, exacerbated by claims of immunity or blind-eye-turning by mission leaders, has tarnished too many international operations, whether run by the UN or Nato. </p> <p>The report calls for a \"human security response force\" of 15,000 people, of whom a third would be police and civilian specialists. Around 5,000 should be ready to deploy within days. There would be a civil-military crisis management centre in Brussels to provide early warning by keeping in touch with NGOs and monitors on the ground. </p> <p>These proposals offer a genuine alternative, which go a long way towards solving the spot-the-difference riddle. Whether the report is acted on will largely depend on Javier Solana, its sponsor. He is already recruiting staff for what will be one of the commission's largest departments. </p> <p>Giving direction to this giant bureaucracy will require strong determination and a willingness to change the ethos of the top-down Nato and United Nations interventions of the past. Far more than the conventional goals of improving airlift capacity or ensuring national weapon-systems are inter-operable, Europe needs brain and sensitivity if it is to be respected as a new global player. </p> <p> Javier Solana's report is on <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global  \">www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Amid increasing doubts about his leadership of the English National Opera, Sean Doran has pulled a rabbit out of a hat - enticing the leading film director, Anthony Minghella, to essay opera for the first time. <p>Minghella, director of Cold Mountain, The Talented Mr Ripley and The English Patient, will make his operatic debut directing a new production of Puccini's Madame Butterfly at the London Coliseum in November next year. </p> <p>\"I can't think of a better opera to investigate, nor a more supportive and creative environment in which to work,\" he said. </p> <p>Minghella will be joined by several colleagues, including the associate director and choreographer, Carolyn Choa, who worked on The English Patient and The Talented Mr Ripley, and the set designer, Dante Ferretti, who collaborated on Cold Mountain. </p> <p>The production - to be conducted by David Parry with a cast led by Mary Plazas - will form part of the ENO's 2005-6 season, the first for which Doran will have been fully responsible since he joined as artistic director and chief executive in April 2003. </p> <p>Full details of the season, to be announced in January, will be seen as a crucial test of Doran's artistic vision. His critics have argued that he focuses on short-term sensation and spectacle - as with the appearance of the ENO at this year's Glastonbury festival - to the exclusion of the core work of a national opera company. But he told the Times: \"I want [the Coliseum] to be the most exciting venue in London, bar none. Not just for opera audiences but for theatre, visual arts and film audiences.\" </p> <p>The ENO will raise eyebrows again this week. Tonight sees the first revival of Calixto Bieito's production of Don Giovanni. It split audiences when first shown in 2001: regarded by some as a viscerally exciting and truthful vision of the opera; but by others as offensively sexual, and out of step with Mozart's intentions. </p> <p>Tomorrow, the company is hosting an evening of central Asian vocal music - regarded by some as having little to do with ENO's remit of presenting accessible opera in English. </p> <p>Minghella joins a long list of film directors who have been attracted by opera. Lars von Trier hit the headlines earlier in the year when he pulled out of his long-awaited production of the Ring cycle at Bayreuth, while in 2003 Andrei Tarkovsky's production of Boris Godunov was aired at the Royal Opera.</p>",
  "John Kerry regained the initiative in the US presidential race last night with a forceful performance in his first debate with George Bush, occasionally leaving the president scowling and at a loss for words. <p>Instant-response polls by three major television networks all showed that a large majority of their viewers thought the challenger had won the 90-minute verbal contest at the University of Miami - the first of three debates in the last month of the campaign.</p> <p>Perhaps even more seriously for President Bush, the networks ignored broadcasting guidelines agreed beforehand and showed both candidates at the same time. On several occasions, Mr Bush could be seen sour-faced and nervous in reaction to some of Mr Kerry's remarks. Similar \"cut-away\" shots of Al Gore in the first presidential debate four years ago sapped his campaign and helped put Mr Bush into office.</p> <p>After last night's debate, senior Democrats made it clear that they would make maximum use of the pictures of a disgruntled President Bush.</p> <p>\"What you saw was a president who was annoyed, angry and aloof. He clearly didn't want to be there, and he was slouched over his podium,\" said Terry McCauliffe, the Democratic party chairman, in an interview in \"spin alley\", a university basketball court where partisans of each side strove frenetically to influence media coverage of the event.</p> <p>Mr McCauliffe's Republican counterpart, Ed Gillespie, laughed off the description, saying: \"I don't know what Terry thought he saw, but the president was obviously very engaged and very clear about his policies.\"</p> <p>However, several conservative commentators awarded the encounter to Senator Kerry on points. Morton Kondracke, an outspoken hawk on Fox News, said he did not think the president \"had dominated\" and argued \"Kerry looked like a commander-in-chief\".</p> <p>The Democratic challenger lived up to his reputation for hitting his best form in the closing stages of an election race, answering his critics by delivering a string of short, declarative statements, with relatively few of the verbal meanderings for which he has become famous on the campaign trail.</p> <p>He rejected Mr Bush's central claim that Iraq was a central front in the \"global war on terror\". \"Iraq was not even close to the centre of the war on terror before the president invaded it,\" he said</p> <p>As he has done in the past, the president took Mr Kerry to task for inconsistency in criticising the Iraq invasion. He pointed out that the senator had voted to approve the use of force in 2002, and had declared Saddam's Iraq to be a \"grave threat\".</p> <p>\"It was a threat. That's not the issue. The issue is what you do about it,\" Senator Kerry replied. \"The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the UN and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.\"</p> <p>Throughout the debate, Mr Kerry pounded the president for the US military's failure to capture Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora in Afghanistan, and for diverting resources from the battle against al-Qaida to Iraq. </p> <p>In return, Mr Bush hit back repeatedly with the argument that Mr Kerry's wavering position on the Iraq war and his description of the invasion as a \"diversion\" sent \"mixed messages\" to US troops and allies.</p> <p>That was also the main message driven home by Bush aides afterwards in \"spin alley\". Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, pointed to what he said was a new contradiction in the Kerry position. </p> <p>\"He said the war was a mistake, but he also said he was not asking American soldiers to die for a mistake,\" Mr Rove said. \"Here's a guy who voted for the war and then says it's the wrong war at the wrong time. How can you go to the allies and ask them to go in there, if you're saying it's the 'wrong war'?\"</p> <p>Mr Bush did appear to score some points, hitting back at Senator Kerry for a longwinded explanation of his position on \"pre-emptive strikes\" in which the Democrat said he would only consider such an action if it passed a \"global test\" and gathered international support.</p> <p>The president said he did not know what \"a global test\" was but added: \"My attitude is you take pre-emptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.\" </p> <p>But at other moments in the contest, Mr Bush seemed to lose track of his point between sentences and seemed to struggle to fill his allotted time for each response. Challenged by Mr Kerry for awarding tax cuts to wealthy Americans while the money could have been used to improve America's counter-terrorist defences, the president reply was vague and hesitant.</p> <p>\"Of course, we're doing everything we can to protect America. I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. That's my job,\" Mr Bush said. \"I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how best to protect us. There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so. It's hard work.\"</p>",
  "<p>In one decade an area of forest twice the size of Portugal has been destroyed in the Amazon, the planet's most bio-diverse forest, so a Brazilian plan to better protect the area through sustainable forestry, certainly sounds positive.</p> <p>But the plan - which is due to go to Brazilian Congress in two weeks - is proving highly controversial. </p> <p>The proposed law, first discussed in 2002 under Brazil's rightwing former president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, would grant access to public land for sustainable use, initially for 30 years. </p> <p>Licences would be allocated under a system of competitive bids and would be open only to Brazilian firms. Licence-holders would pay an annual fee calculated on what they extract, such as wood or resins, from their plot. </p> <p>But information on how much money the government will make from the licences is hard to come by.</p> <p>The topic gained particular notoriety after Brazil's O Globo newspaper described it as \"a plan to privatise the Amazon\", saying the government wanted to sell land to private enterprises, including non-Brazilians. </p> <p>The parliamentary group in defence of Brazil, a nationalist group, has claimed the law would threaten Brazil's sovereignty.</p> <p>The government says its intention is the exact opposite. </p> <p>Speaking to Guardian Unlimited last month during the second international Amazonian trade fair in the Amazonian city of Manaus, Malvino Salvador, forestry and sustainable development agency director for Amazonas state, said the law should \"facilitate conservation of public land and better protect it by insisting parties fulfil rules and pay for the privilege\".</p> <p>Environmental and social organisations largely favour regulation for sustainable land use, though they have expressed concerns about the details. </p> <p>However, in response to claims by O Globo that environmental organisations were violently opposed to the plan, a working group of NGOs and social groups was obliged to issue a statement clarifying their position, which stated: \"Contrary to press reports, the law is an attempt to guarantee public control for public land.\"</p> <p>That measures are needed to protect the Amazon is unquestionable; today the area is victim to illegal wood logging, destructive cattle ranching and soya production and forest burning at increasing rates. But how to protect the area, home to 20 million people and the generator of 8% of Brazil's exports, in an economically viable way is no easy feat. </p> <p>Even within the environment ministry there are diverging opinions. Virgilio Vianna, environment and sustainable development secretary for Amazonas state said: \"I favour the concession proposal. It is far better for [extraction] to be ordered and disciplined than not - but not in its current form.\" </p> <p>While 70% of the Amazon is public land, potential concession areas - land that remains outside conservation, local population or research areas - is far smaller at around 2%. </p> <p>In practice, this means a hectare, which typically has 300 adult trees and 10,000 more growing, would allow five to six trees to be chopped down every thirty years. </p> <p>\"With good forest management, you shouldn't be able to tell that trees have been cut,\" said Tasso Azevedo, director of the environment ministry's national forestry programme. </p> <p>One of the main hurdles to regulation is land ownership. \"There has been no legal framework permitting the use of public land, let alone encouraging sustainable use forest use,\" explained Brazil's Friends of the Earth director, Roberto Smeraldi. This has discouraged serious law-abiding businesses interested in invested, he added.</p> <p>And mapping such land remains a challenge. Paulo Barreto, a researcher with Imazon, which promotes sustainable development in the Amazon, explained that a high number of land title documents are illegal or false, and the government lacks ownership proof. </p> <p>Another concern is implementation of concessions. Jefferson Peres, senator for the leftwing Democratic Workers party, said implementation requires the National Institute of Colonisation and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and Brazil's Institute for Environmental and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) to have \"far more resources, trained personnel, and better coordination\". \"Implementing the law any time soon would be precipitous,\" he added. </p> <p>\"There are certainly ways the proposal could be improved,\" stated Friends of the Earth's Smeraldi. He cited the lack of guarantees as a problem, saying financial collateral is needed for concessions. </p> <p>He also said the government's choice of flexible payments (based on the value of what is extracted) does not encourage the most economical use of land, stimulate good forestry management or technological investment. </p> <p>Paulo Prado, of environmental organisation Conservation International (Brazil), added that the current study has not taken into account how to include local workforces into such projects.</p> <p>In response to such criticism, Mr Azevedo said the current situation is untenable. \"This law will provide some security - that alone is a gigantic change.\" The politician added: \"We are adopting this new model precisely because land is being destroyed now.\" But he added that the participation of NGOs and social groups in debating the law remains \"essential\". </p> <p>The government has examined over 50 cases of forestry concession worldwide but it is difficult to draw comparisons. Brazil's forests are generally more diverse and larger than elsewhere and already have significant communities living there.</p> <p>Peru, which adopted a law two years ago permitting long-term concessions, is the best equivalent model, argues Smeraldi, because it encompasses parts of the Amazon - although the Peruvian law is already being revised in the light of experience, Smeraldi said.</p> <p>And if parties don't fulfill the rules? \"We are not going to allow just anybody access to concession rights. If a party breaks the rules they lose their rights,\" said Malvino Salvador. Moreover, for the first 10 years only 20% of the potential land will available for concessions. </p> <p>Flying over the Amazon, it is impossible to imagine that a lack of trees, which reach far further than they eye can see, could ever be a problem. But Brazil's Atlantic forest only has 7% intact. \"We cannot repeat this in the Amazon,\" warned Virg\u00edlio Vianna.</p> <p>When the law reaches Congress in the coming weeks it will doubtless generate a heated debate. As Jose Rabelo of Amazonas' environment protection institute (IPAAM) made clear: \"Doing nothing is not an option.\"</p>",
  "In the court of international opinion, it sometimes seems the US just cannot win. A string of surveys suggests growing resentment around the world over America's role as \"global policeman\". <p>But when Washington's squad cars fail to arrive at the scene of an incident, the US gets blamed for inaction. </p> <p>Sudan is a good example. According to the UN, the tragedy in Darfur is \"the world's worst humanitarian crisis\". </p> <p>Two UN security council resolutions, and much diplomatic huffing and puffing, have so far failed to end the suffering. </p> <p>The Bush administration has not been silent, declaring this month that a genocide is in progress in Darfur. Under international law, that means it is legally obliged to stop it. But George Bush appears to have no plans for direct humanitarian intervention, either unilaterally or under UN auspices. </p> <p>Many people may feel this is irresponsible. And indeed, criticism can be heard, not least from the Democratic presidential contender, John Kerry, that President Bush is neglecting a wide range of other international flashpoints as he focuses on November's elections. </p> <p>The list includes North Korea's nuclear bomb making, similar worries about Iran, intensifying instability in Afghanistan, Russia's imploding democracy, the China-Taiwan stand-off, and the moribund Middle East peace process. </p> <p>Yet while global expectations of the US remain high, international opinion surveys reveal a deep contradiction: Europeans and others who complain Washington is not doing enough in places such as Sudan or Palestine simultaneously favour a diminution of the global super-cop act of the US. </p> <p>According to a poll conducted by the German Marshall Fund - Transatlantic Trends 2004 - 58% of Europeans say that, in theory at least, they want less US leadership in international affairs, not more. </p> <p>And 76% disapprove of US foreign policy (up 20% in two years). </p> <p>This year's Pew Research Centre's Global Attitudes Project found that in most countries, US leadership and motives were being increasingly distrusted; 78% of French respondents doubted that the US was intent on promoting democracy round the world. \"There is even more scepticism for the motives for the 'war on terrorism' in predominantly Muslim countries,\" the Pew survey states. \"By wide margins, the publics [sic] of Turkey, Morocco, Jordan and Pakistan question America's sincerity.\" </p> <p>Instead, majorities there and elsewhere believe the principal US aim is world domination. </p> <p>Intriguingly, however, US public attitudes coincide on many points with those of Europeans and Arabs/Muslims. Dismayingly for British Eurosceptics, the Marshall Fund poll found, for example, that 70% of US respondents would like to see a morepowerful EU showing greater international leadership. </p> <p>Another survey, published this week by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations (Global Views 2004), reports that more than three-quarters of Americans disapprove of the US behaving as a planetary law enforcer. </p> <p>Most Americans think the that US should be more willing to work through the UN, that it should sign up to the Kyoto protocol on global warming as well as to the international criminal court, and also pay more heed to world court rulings. </p> <p>The Chicago survey found Americans' support for maintaining US forces' bases in the Middle East to be falling sharply; and that \"the US should withdraw its forces from Iraq if a clear majority of the Iraqi people wants this\". </p> <p>Strikingly, a majority of Americans also rejects the Bush doctrine of preventive, unilateral war, and, in even larger numbers, opposes \"the use of US troops to install democratic governments in states where dictators rule\". </p> <p>Nor is this simply a revival of isolationism. While joining much of the world in rejecting the US role of global policeman, Americans make a distinction in situations such as Darfur. According to the Chicago poll, they \"strongly endorse\" use of force to prevent genocide and \"favour using US troops for this purpose\". </p> <p>The public's message in the US, Europe and elsewhere seems broadly consistent: America's unmatched power, used wisely and sparingly, can be a force for good. When it is not, as in Iraq, the US ends up in the dock.</p>",
  "<p>Traditionally, racehorses have been the profitable plaything of choice for moneyed royals in the Middle East. But Sheikh Maktoum Hasher Maktoum al-Maktoum, nephew of the crown prince of Dubai, is planning to swap bloodstock for burning rubber with a scheme to launch a rival to formula one. </p> <p>When the committed motor racing fan announced this year that he planned to create the A1 grand prix series, which he dubbed the sport's \"world cup\", many were sceptical. A number of attempts to create a winter alternative to formula one have foundered in recent years. </p> <p>Most recently, an embryonic plan to launch a series of races featuring F1-style cars decked out in the liveries of football clubs came to naught. F1 might be enduring well documented problems on the circuit and off, but it retains a monolithic status for the sponsors that fund the sport in terms of global reach, glamour and exposure. As such, the idea of launching a second high-profile global series looks ambitious at best. </p> <p>But as Roman Abramovich has shown at Stamford Bridge, a fan-like devotion to a sport and hundreds of millions in the bank can be a heady brew. Sheikh Maktoum insists that the idea is a serious business venture; last night in London, he unveiled the first six teams that will compete in the A1 championship. </p> <p>A1's organisers have promised that the championship, due to start next autumn, will feature at least 26 teams, one from each country taking part, racing in 10 to 14 exotic locations. Tests on the car, led by the general manager of A1 grand prix and former F1 test driver Stephen Watson, have been completed. </p> <p>The cars won't be as fast as F1 but will all be identical, a factor that its backers hope will re-inject some of the excitement that has been lacking from F1 in recent years as Michael Schumacher's Ferrari has led a series of processions. The identical cars have been designed to provide exciting racing with the emphasis on driving ability and plenty of overtaking. </p> <p>The business model is different too. In each country, backers will sign a three-year franchise contract to run their nation's team. A1 grand prix will provide the cars and the circuits and take charge of organising the travelling circus that surrounds any big motor racing event. Britain, South Africa, China, Portugal, Pakistan and Lebanon are the first countries to commit to being \"national seat holders\". </p> <p>In return, it will take an annual fee from the teams and keep the bulk of television revenue. In theory, the franchise holders will then find willing sponsors keen to expand into new markets at cheaper rates than F1 and keep most of that revenue. </p> <p>In Britain, which Sheikh Maktoum says has been the most \"cynical\" market, the idea was recently given a credibility boost by the involvement of BSkyB. </p> <p>The pay-TVcompany, looking for cheap ways of boosting its sports portfolio, has agreed to screen the races, qualifying and practice sessions exclusively live. When the deal was signed, Sky Sports chief Vic Wakeling said: \"We have been sold on the concept of a genuine test of driving skills which, of course, A1 grand prix is designed to provide - and we are delighted to be involved from the beginning.\" </p> <p>ITV, which has exclusive rights to F1 until 2009, is understandably less impressed with the upstart. \"Formula one has proven to be robust against all other types of motor sport,\" says ITV head of sport, Brian Barwick. \"It is the best, most watched, most followed motor sport and that isn't going to change in the near future.\" </p> <p>Sports marketing experts point out that the global dip in the value of sports rights and the financial problems hobbling some F1 teams might yet blow a hole in A1 grand prix's balance sheet. </p> <p>For Sky, it's a relatively low-stakes gamble. For Sheikh Maktoum the risks are higher. He justifies his confidence by pointing out that he has all but agreed deals with 12 to 18 franchise holders and is in \"detailed negotiations\" with others. </p> <p>\"I believe in the long term we'll see a bigger audience than formula one,\" he says. \"I believe we'll break into the US market plus Japan, Pakistan, India, Malaysia - there's huge untapped potential there.\" Given that F1 claims a global television audience of more than 350 million for every race, that's quite some boast. </p> <p>Sheikh Maktoum says the franchise idea was inspired by the number of western firms setting up franchises in the Middle East: \"We're selling the idea back to you.\" </p> <p>Soon afterwards, he brought in South African entrepreneurs Brian Menell and Antonio Teixeira as minority shareholders after they approached him to take on a team franchise. \"Anybody can say 'Sheikh, it's a wonderful idea' but these two prominent businessmen chased me for six months and put their hands in their pockets.\" He hopes all 26 franchise holders will take a similar attitude. </p> <p>He dismisses suggestions that the idea is a rich man's plaything, but adds that his family's cash and contacts have enabled him to speed the concept from drawing board to race track. The start-up costs have been huge. Sheikh Maktoum and his investors are believed to have paid $80m (\u00a344m) to get the idea off the ground, and prize money is costing $72m over the first three seasons. But, to put the outlay in perspective, Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Maktoum's uncle, is valued at $10bn. </p> <p>The sheikh says A1 grand prix will be profitable within three years, taking motor racing, and sponsors, to parts of the world that F1 can't reach. There is, he believes, untapped potential in countries such as Dubai, Qatar and Bahrain as well as developing nations such as China and India. The series will also take in southern hemisphere racing strongholds such as Australia, South Africa and Malaysia. </p> <p>Big multinationals that do not invest in F1 because they see it as \"scary\" will, he hopes, be enthused by the prospect of reaching a global TV audience. </p> <p>\"You go to the largest producer of olive oil in Italy, for example, and that oil producer has five or six brands that would love to do business in China, Australia and the Middle East. This gives them a way in.\" Already, he says, there has been interest from possible franchise holders and sponsors in Lebanon, India and Pakistan, not motor racing strongholds. </p> <p>Sheikh Maktoum is an enthusiastic salesman, but huge questions remain. Not least whether the fans, who judging by the enthusiasts who populate F1 message boards are far from convinced, can be sold on the concept. The hope is that having one driver per country, combined with shorter, closer races, will convince even non-F1 fans. \"Fans will be in the pub, cheering the British driver as he passes the French driver,\" he says hopefully.</p>",

  "<p>A swing to growth in US album sales and surging consumption of music on DVD helped slow the decline in first-half global sales of recorded music, the trade body for the world's largest record companies said yesterday. </p> <p>Music sales worldwide fell 1.3% to $13.9bn in the first half of 2004, while artists such as Norah Jones and Usher helped boost unit sales by 1.7% to 1.22bn, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry said. </p> <p>That compares with a 10.7 % value slide in the first half of 2003 and is the slowest rate of decline in four years, an indication that the industry is having some success convincing people to pay for music online and is tempting consumers with new products such as music videos. </p> <p>Music video sales grew by more than 20% during the first half to account for 7.2% of total recorded music volume, more than double the 3.1% they represented in 2001. </p> <p>\"There are some signs that the world's markets are beginning to recover, boosted by the continued growth of DVD music video, digital sales and added-value releases,\" IFPI chairman and chief executive Jay Berman said. </p> <p>Although the amount of legal music downloading has surged, it is not expected to contribute significantly to global sales figures for years. </p> <p>About 60% of the industry's sales come during the second half, and the four major companies - Vivendi's Universal Music, SonyBMG, EMI Group and Warner Music - are betting on more hits from the likes of Britney Spears and U2 to help level off four years of declining sales. European sales declined 7.7%, with slight gains in Britain offset by losses in France, Italy and Spain.</p>",
  "<p>After Michael Moore made his first documentary, the highly successful Roger and Me, about what happens to a company town when the company changes its mind, he made sure to send a copy, with gratitude, to the little-known film-maker whose 1986 masterpiece showed him the way. </p> <p>The masterpiece was called Sherman's March; the film-maker was Ross McElwee. While Moore's career curve has moved off the chart, McElwee has never stopped making his idiosyncratic, small-scale pictures, culminating in his latest, Bright Leaves. Although the superficial mark of McElwee's style - the almost-zero-budget, one-guy-with-a-camera, real-life approach to big screen narrative - has become a commonplace in the two decades since Sherman's March, the deeper features that make McElwee's work so unique, moving and funny now set him apart from his contemporaries more clearly than ever. </p> <p>\"Michael Moore has been very gracious in his appreciation,\" says McElwee from his office at Harvard, where he teaches. \"But clearly he's gone off in a whole different direction. The only similarity, I think, is logistically. But then that's not true any more, because he's got a crew now.\" </p> <p>As with most of his films, McElwee made Bright Leaves by himself. He was producer, director, camerman, sound recordist and editor, and quite often made his own coffee as well. \"I think filming alone enables me to move at my own pace,\" he says. \"When you've got a crew in tow you're forced to think more methodically about what you're going to accomplish because you're spending other people's time, and a great deal of money employing them. The other advantage is that the people in front of the camera are more relaxed.\" </p> <p>The new film, opening in London next week, purports to be about McElwee's research into the story behind a 1950 Hollywood movie, Bright Leaf, starring Gary Cooper, Lauren Bacall and Patricia Neal. That film portrays rival North Carolina tobacco barons; McElwee, who hails from North Carolina, believed the Cooper character was based on the biography of his great-grandfather. </p> <p>In fact, the film is about much more. Bright Leaves takes you on a winding road that, although it ends up nowhere in particular, takes in McElwee's meditations about his own life, his father and his son; the oddness of charming people growing, in lovely countryside, beautiful green tobacco plants that go on to kill half a million people in the US each year; the question of whether Hollywood films can contain secret home movies hidden inside them; the pleasures of smoking; a dog, a cat, and a rat; shrinking beauty queens; and the residual grudges of rival southern families. Bright Leaves, with its chance encounters and digressive riffing, appears to have been thrown together as much as it was planned; yet as the film proceeds, it paints a picture of McElwee, his vast extended family and their North Carolina community that is somehow more true and intimate than any feature film, and most documentaries, could provide. </p> <p>To those who have seen any of McElwee's earlier films - he has made seven feature-length documentaries - the style will be familiar. Sherman's March was, its narrator announced, a serious documentary about the bloody travels of General William Sherman through Georgia during the American civil war. What audiences actually saw was one of the funniest films ever made, as the film-maker was interrupted in his researches by falling in love, or lust, with a series of wonderfully real women whose paths he appeared to cross arbitrarily. </p> <p>If Sherman's March was a film about love disguised as a documentary about war, Bright Leaves is a film about death disguised as a jolly rummage through the family attic. With its meandering storyline, its obsession with fathers, children and mortality, and its urban, northern hero's quest for meaning in his rural, southern motherland, it seems as much like a modern American novel as a modern American film. </p> <p>\"I think that's accurate,\" says McElwee. \"When I was at high school, when I was 17 or 18, I was sure I wanted to be a fiction writer, and I went into university as a creative writing major ... I don't think I ever left my writerly desires, and my urge to conjoin documentary material with a very subjective, internal stream-of-consciousness narration probably connected with my early desire to write.\" </p> <p>After Sherman's March, which won the feature documentary category at Sundance and was named by the International Documentary Association as one of the top 20 documentaries of all time, McElwee made three films before his latest: Something to Do With the Wall (1990), with Marilyn Levine, about Berlin and the cold war; Time Indefinite (1993), a sequel to Sherman's March; and Six O'Clock News (1996), about the way local news stations report catastrophes. </p> <p>He has never grown wealthy from cinema. Time and income are split between teaching and making films, both of which he enjoys. \"Once, I tried to do something for Miramax,\" he says. \"They wanted me to try shaping a script. I liked the material; I worked on it for a long time. Basically, they rejected it.\" </p> <p>Bright Leaves was a long time in the making. The first scene was shot in 1997. One of the oddities of the film is that it has footage of one of McElwee's sons, Adrian, as a small boy and as a much older boy. In some ways, McElwee resembles a southern Presbyterian Woody Allen and he conceded that what he may be making is a single, long film covering his, the director's, entire life. </p> <p>\"The last shot of Time Indefinite is the first shot of Six O'Clock News,\" he says. \"The same people keep reappearing in my films. I'm interested in how much we change over time and how little we change over time. I think there are people out there who find looking at all the films an interesting experience.\" </p> <p>It may be that McElwee's solipsistic sense of his own life-narrative - plus an enormous amount of patient, skilful editing - is what makes his documentaries so much more than just a porridge of digressions and chance meetings that happen in front of his lens. For there is much he comes across by accident. </p> <p>It's clear that he sought out cancer patients, such as the one who recommends morphine to everybody who is trying to quit smoking; and tobacco farmers, such as the woman whose mother, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer. (She says: \"My growing tobacco has nothing to do with my mother's dying. It has nothing to do with anyone who dies.\") But it was pure coincidence, McElwee tells me, that he came across the last ever tobacco festival in a small North Carolina town, and met the last Miss Tobacco. </p> <p>Nor could the director have known, when he arranged to meet the noted film theorist Vlada Petric at a film festival to talk about Bright Leaf, that Petric would put him in a wheelchair and push him along as he lectured him. But it ended up as one of the film's most memorable, and funny, scenes. \"As we circle the block for the fifth time, I find myself wondering how I managed to get myself in this situation,\" narrates McElwee, \"bound in the chair and lectured at close range by a rabid film theorist.\" </p> <p>At one point, McElwee leaves his cheap motel room and begins compulsively filming objects of striking banality in the parking lot. \"Sometimes, I feel it's such a pleasure to film, especially down south, that it almost doesn't matter what I'm filming,\" he narrates, in his hypnotically smooth southern baritone. \"Even just shooting around a motel can be an almost narcotic experience. I mean, I don't want to force an analogy but come to think of it, for me, filming is not unlike smoking a cigarette.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bright Leaves is released on October 8.</p>",
  "When Tony Blair told BBC TV last night that \"lots of people\" in his government would like a crack at his job one day he gave the clearest signal that the drama he had just unleashed on an unsuspecting world is driven by politics, not by his health problems. <p>Because that seemingly casual phrase was also saying that, as of now, Gordon Brown, his oldest ally in politics cannot assume that he will be the anointed Blair successor when the time comes to stand down around 2008 just before the next but one election. </p> <p>Mr Brown was damned with generous praise. It will anger and dismay him and his acolytes. </p> <p>The fact that the chancellor had not known about Mr Blair's decision until he stepped off a plane in Washington for an IMF meeting speaks volumes. Mr Blair has been in discussion with his closest circle - figures such as Sally Morgan and Pat McFadden - for over a month. The deputy prime minister John Prescott had also been informed, as had John Burton, his loyal agent in Sedgefield. </p> <p>The decision to announce an orderly timetable for his retirement - he will still only be 55 in May 2008 - was mapped out in Mr Blair's head before his summer holiday after another bout of TB/GB skirmishing. </p> <p>So was his decision to have his intermittent heart flutter sorted out by a minor surgical procedure this morning rather than soldier on with pills. \"You can live with it perfectly well or you have a small corrective procedure,\" one ally said last night. </p> <p>Mr Blair has been under huge strain from the Iraq war and its relentless controversies and sorrow for at least two years - on top of his domestic political agenda and the pressures of a boisterous parental life with three teenagers and young Leo. </p> <p>He eats and drinks normally - steak, fish, red and white wine, champagne sometimes. He is a fit man with a minor short circuiting problem, the doctors insisted last night. </p> <p>So the flutter which troubled him at Sir Cliff Richard's Barbados villa during August - before the political flutter of his evening with Italy's Silvio Berlusconi - was a recurrence of his 2003 problem, but not the first one. Some close colleagues knew he was planning another hospital visit when time allowed. </p> <p>But the medical paranoia which accompanies the health of leaders - Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, Anthony Eden, Woodrow Wilson, even young JFK, the list is long - meant any statement would trigger speculation of the \"is he seriously ill?\" variety. </p> <p>Blair was clear in his own mind that he wanted to serve a full third term, but that it would not be possible to serve a fourth since at the age of 58, he would have been leader of the party for 14 years. He was coming under permanent pressure from the media to say if he planned to serve a full third term, and he could only reply that he did. </p> <p>The Tories had started running posters suggesting vote Tony and get Gordon. Michael Howard in parliament was even taunting Mr Blair that he was determined to serve a full term as leader in the next parliament, could the prime minister give the same assurance? </p> <p>At the same time if Mr Blair left it open as to when he would stand down, the speculation would rumble on. The charge was also being put that he was suffering from the Thatcher complex of immortality. He would be \"going on and on\". </p> <p>The speculation was also feeding the doubts and impatience of the Brownite camp. The risk in the announcement of setting a retirement date was that it would render him a lame duck, and trigger a four year battle for succession. The doubts were cast aside. </p> <p>The decision was duly made to kill two birds with one stone - announce his decision to run a third term and the heart operation. But Mr Blair only decided after his conference speech to make the announcement immediately after the conference and close of the Hartlepool poll. </p> <p>Members of the cabinet were rung by his staff less than an hour before he announced his plans on the big 10 o'clock bulletins. Most were supportive if surprised, Peter Hain the leader of the Commons was thrust into the TV studios to explain the decision. </p> <p>Why has he done it? Very few people know Mr Blair's inner mind and there is always a rival, equally vehement version, from the team at No 11. But the evidence from the Blair camp points to Mr Blair being what one ally called \"increasingly fed up with the destablising of the party and the government in successive pushes from next door (No 11) to weaken him and create a negative environment in which people expect or want Tony to leave office\". </p> <p>Blairites are now saying - some were saying it before last night without being believed - that the premier is telling everyone, ie Mr Brown, that they will have a chance in 2008. If they want to challenge him beforehand the risks of damage to all sides will be there to see.</p>",
  "The prime minister's announcement that he will not go on and on sends out political shockwaves. All political careers end sometime - but in Britain the time of going is usually unknown. This ends the always unrealistic speculation that he might stand down before the next election - but it creates an unfamiliar fixed time frame for an end to his era, presumably in about 2007 to give his successor time. News of his physical weakness surprises after a week in which he yet again established his mastery over his party and saw off rebellion over Iraq. <p>It was a curious conference, though. One minister told me on the first day that their local party was \"heartbroken over Iraq\" and at first that mood was in the Brighton air. But this week has felt like watching a couple getting a long-standing marriage back together after an act of infidelity, a betrayal that will never be quite forgiven or forgotten yet has been overcome. And so they came through. </p> <p>I write before knowing the Hartlepool result: if he has scraped through that too, he's a lucky man - the quality Napoleon prized most in his generals. If the Lib Dems did squeeze past, that's another blow (but as an omen for the general election, it remains rather worse for the Tories who were second last time to sink to third or fourth now.) </p> <p>Whatever that result, he does return to Downing Street still permanently winged by Iraq. What has it done to him? Some say it has unhinged him: after seven years no leader is quite sane, no longer quite on our planet. Others look ahead and see how it has forced him to hand his ministers more control over shaping the third term, no bad thing. Both these may be true - but it all depends whether he is talking about home or abroad. </p> <p>At present he talks very little sense about abroad. What is Britain's foreign policy for the third term? Nothing he says reflects a believable vision of the country's place in the world. </p> <p>Consider his earnest pledge at a Muslim Council of Britain fringe meeting, talking about the need for a Middle East peace plan: \"It is absolutely vital that we revive and restart the process. I can assure you I will do everything I can. I regard it as a priority, I regard it as something that I will feel a sense of personal failure over if we cannot get movement back into this process.\" </p> <p>Personal failure? Foreign policy is not a one-man mission, as many said when he rashly promised that the road to Iraq was on a twin track with the roadmap to Middle East peace. He seems to have forgotten his humiliation in the White House rose garden when President Bush shafted any idea of a roadmap by signing up to Sharon's unilateral plan. As a result, destabilised Palestine is imploding in despair. </p> <p>So how will he avoid \"personal failure\" this time? Bush looks set to be back in the White House, but despite the high cost of the political support Tony Blair gave him, there is plentiful evidence already of how little leverage Britain has. In the conference speech, Tony Blair felt obliged to repeat what an intelligent man must know is breath-taking Pentagon nonsense about the nature of global terror. </p> <p>As for Europe, even with leadership of the EU and G8 coming his way next year, his weakened influence post-Iraq will take another hard hit if he fails to get Britain to sign up to the EU constitution. He has done nothing so far to persuade the British people while his Chancellor's speech had nothing but insults for the EU, hardly a winning ploy. </p> <p>Hopes that John Kerry might save him are fading. But even if Kerry won, he owes Tony Blair no favours, no reason to make London his first port of call in Europe. So forget the \"bridge\": neither America nor Europe beckons. He lacks any credible language to speak about either. </p> <p>But turn to the home front and here is the mirror image. Here is indeed a good \"forward offer\", the unfortunate phrase of the moment. In Brighton minister after minister stepped up to display a third term agenda of conviction and ambition, an array of promises fulfilled, plans for the next term and a wise humility about how much harder it is than they realised to make real change happen out there on the ground. Try to imagine how this would look now, if only there had been no Iraq war. Even hostile observers might grudgingly acknowledge how well Labour is now sustaining and renewing itself in office. If only there had been no war. </p> <p>New directions? Here are a sample six totemic policy changes drenched in Labour heartland tradition. To be sure, a braver Labour should have done them long ago, but all six put right old wrongs. </p> <p>There will be no more selection for specialist schools, allowed until now to choose 10% of their pupils by \"aptitude\". </p> <p>It looks certain that private schools and hospitals will at last lose their charitable status (though some may earn other tax breaks). </p> <p>Real House of Lords reform will happen at last - with 80% elected, probably by Billy Bragg's formula. </p> <p>Pension reform is set to tilt back in favour of bigger basic state pensions for all - more popular if not fairer. Invalidity benefit will not be arbitrarily capped - but a New Deal with more carrot than stick can help the despaired and unfit find jobs. </p> <p>A change that attracts less notice, yet affects millions of working lives ends the two-tier workforce that lets private contractors pay less than public service rates to their cleaners, porters and carers: they will all now get the NHS \u00a35.69 an hour. This may mean hospitals and schools bring their manual staff back in to better pay and career ladders. </p> <p>Finally, the NHS is vanquishing private medicine. The 1997 maximum waiting time for an operation was 18 months and now it is about to become 18 weeks. But it's even better than that: the pre-1997 \"wait\" excluded hidden time - often months - waiting to get a first appointment, for tests, and even waiting to get onto waiting lists. Now Labour's wait is honestly counted from first GP visit to climbing into bed - with an average down to six weeks by 2008. The result is that private medicine is losing patients so fast that private hospitals are closing. </p> <p>To be sure, Labour must answer deeper questions than those six ideology-laden totems. Will Britain be more socially just? Will children born under Labour get a better chance in life? Will Gordon Brown's \"progressive consensus\" turn the conservative tide to persuade Britain to be more Swedish social democrat than American wild west? Will we be any nearer the heart of Europe where we belong? After seven years, not all of these are certain. </p> <p>Now that Tony Blair has effectively named the day of his departure, he has set himself a short time to make good all those things he has left undone. He has become a middle-aged man in a hurry.</p>",
  "Politicians, industry leaders and environment groups across the world welcomed the news last night that Russia had rejuvenated international efforts to combat climate change by ratifying the Kyoto protocol. <p>President Vladimir Putin's decision isolates the US, and brings Russia closer economic and political ties with the European Union. </p> <p>The treaty, which commits 30 industrialised countries into legally binding greenhouse gas reduction targets, will kick-start a multibillion- pound carbon trading market, the transfer of clean technologies to developing countries and promote joint ventures with countries in the former Soviet bloc. It is also a blow to President George Bush who repudiated the treaty on taking office and has repeatedly tried to persuade Mr Putin to do the same. </p> <p>Russia's move means that US business will be cut out of the new carbon trading markets which have already been set up in London. Countries and companies in the scheme have targets to cut their carbon dioxide emissions. If they exceed their targets they will be able to sell the extra carbon \"saved\" to other countries or companies which have failed to do so. The market is expected to be worth tens of billions of pounds a year. </p> <p>Carbon trading and incentives to install renewables and other clean technologies in the treaty gives European companies a financial advantage in joint trading agreements with former Eastern bloc and developing countries. </p> <p>Because of the collapse of Russia's economy in the early 1990s, London traders estimated yesterday that Mr Putin's government has $10bn (about \u00a35.5bn) of carbon credits to sell on the international markets to countries which cannot meet their own targets. </p> <p>A flurry of international excitement about Kyoto began yesterday after the Russian cabinet announced that it had prepared the papers to ratify the treaty and was forwarding them to the Russian parliament, or Duma, for ratification. Since Mr Putin's United Russia party controls two-thirds of the Duma, and he directed the cabinet to act, ratification is seen as a virtual certainty. </p> <p>The Kyoto protocol, negotiated in 1997, ties those countries of the industrialised world which have signed up to it into carbon dioxide reductions of around 5% on 1990 levels. </p> <p>Scientists say that cuts of 60% are needed across the world to avoid runaway climate change, mass extinctions and catastrophic sea level rise. </p> <p>However, the treaty was only seen as a first step, and when the first cuts are implemented by 2010 the process is expected to continue, setting tougher targets for 2020. </p> <p>Making a major speech on climate change two weeks ago, Tony Blair emphasised the need to begin thinking beyond 2010 to bring China and India into the process of reducing greenhouse gases. He has already said he will make climate change his priority for his presidency of the G8 next year. </p> <p>The executive secretary of the UN Climate Change Convention, Joke Waller-Hunter, said: \"President Putin has given an inspiring signal to the international community. By giving industry, local authorities and consumers incentives to take action on climate change, Russia and the 29 other industrialised countries that have joined the protocol will set themselves on a path to greater economic efficiency.\" </p> <p>Margaret Beckett, the environment secretary, described it as \"a crucial step forward\". As far as the US was concerned it \"opened up a different vista. The US has long since assumed that Kyoto was dead but it is not. There will be voices in US industry saying 'we are missing out here'. It is early to say where this will lead but this will make a considerable difference.\" </p> <p>The protocol is a legally binding addition to the 1992 climate change convention. The EU as a whole is committed to an 8% reduction on greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels by 2010 and is struggling to reach the target. Some countries will have to buy in carbon from countries such as Russia which have credits to spare. </p> <p>The UK, which has a 12.5% reduction target, is on course to exceed this by about 3% but is unlikely to sell any spare carbon, saving up any extra credits for the next negotiating period to 2020.</p>",
  "<p>The decision by the Russian government to ratify the Kyoto Treaty on climate change yesterday promises to kickstart a multibillion-dollar global emissions trading industry - based in London. </p> <p>The price of CO2 in Europe rose 20% to nearly \u20ac10 (\u00a37) per tonne on the back of the news from Moscow last night, and many industry experts predict further gains with massive new volumes changing hands. </p> <p>More than 1m tonnes of carbon were traded in September - double the figure for all of 2003. Some are forecasting annual volumes will grow to 8m tonnes or even 10m tonnes by the end of 2004. </p> <p>Experts predict that before long new dealing facilities will be developed that could replicate the commodities bourses such as the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) and the London Metal Exchange. </p> <p>There has been buying and selling of carbon for a number of years in London and other cities but in a low-key way. </p> <p>It has been growing faster in recent months in anticipation of legally binding environmental legislation. The European Union has developed national allocations for greenhouse gas emissions but the Russian decision triggers the introduction of global international regulations from 2008. </p> <p>Henrik Hasselknippe, senior analyst with emissions trading consultant Point Carbon, believes Russia alone could earn up to $10bn from selling quotas on the carbon market. </p> <p>He estimates the financial value of the European carbon market will be worth \u20ac10bn (\u00a36.9bn) a year by 2007. </p> <p>\"This [the Russian decision] is the most important news we have heard for many years. </p> <p>\"It gives greater certainty to the [carbon] market and should really provide the kickstart we have been waiting for,\" he said. </p> <p>Kate Hampton, manager of marketing and policy at London-based consultant Climate Change Capital, describes yesterday's decision as \"hugely important\" for emissions trading. </p> <p>\"We are now going to see the more reticent countries in Europe take a more robust line and it will activate a series of mechanisms such as the trading of permits between governments.\" </p> <p>With the US refusing to ratify Kyoto, the treaty has needed a country as large as Russia to achieve the critical mass to become binding. </p> <p>Russia accounts for 17% of total emissions from industrialised countries - 5.6% of global emissions - and brings the industrialised emissions covered by the treaty to 61.6%. </p> <p>At present countries responsible for 65% of global emissions have signed up to the treaty leaving one major exception, the US, which accounts for 20% and is the world's largest single polluter. Russia has to stabilise its emissions at 1990 levels, but political instability and reduced industrial output has seen CO2 output dropping 30% over the last 14 years. This means Russia has vast volumes of quotas to sell into the global emissions market, said Mr Hasselknippe. </p> <p>Leading energy companies such as BP, Shell and RWE in Germany, have been among the most active in the trading of permits to date. Last night BP described Russia's decision as \"helpful\". </p> <p>Just as large financial institutions have started to play a big role in trading oil contracts on the IPE, so have they started to make an appearance trading emissions. </p> <p>Like the oil markets, a network of specialist brokers is beginning to grow around the business with names such as Ecosecurities and Natsource. </p> <p>The relative values of CO2 transactions are still minuscule compared with the oil markets but they are expected to grow from \u20ac96m worth of carbon trades globally last year to \u20ac360m for 2004. </p> <p>Oil prices in recent years have fluctuated from $9 per barrel to $50, but no one can predict what will happen to carbon values. Climate Change Capital believes prices could drop from yesterday's level and bounce about depending on issues such as the relative prices of coal and gas, the influence of the weather on power production and general levels of economic development. </p> <p>So emissions trading might be new, but market characteristics are likely to be familiar.</p>",
  "<p>When Harvey Weinstein used the film Fahrenheit 9/11 to detonate the relationship between Miramax and its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Company, he may well have gotten more than he bargained for. In Weinstein's hands, Michael Moore's anti-Bush missile became a suicide bomb, just as likely to destroy the Miramax co-chair as to shake up Disney. To Disney CEO Michael Eisner, after harbouring Harvey for over a decade, it must have felt like that classic scene in the original Alien where the creature - its glistening, mucoidal tentacles flailing wildly - bursts through the chest of an unlucky crew member. Now that the thing is loose, the question is: what now? </p> <p>Ever since Jeffrey Katzenberg, then Disney chairman, put out the first feelers to Miramax on April Fool's Day, 1993, Miramax has been regarded as a foreign body within the Disney organism, always in danger of being rejected. When the deal was consummated a short time later, industry pundits raised their eyebrows. It was hard to imagine two companies whose cultures were less suited to each other. Disney stood for everything the Weinsteins hated, or claimed to hate. Bob Weinstein had been quoted as saying: \"We don't want to grow up and be another Walt Disney.\" </p> <p>Disney was, after all, the family-friendly, white-bread home of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse, while Miramax had prospered by fanning the flames of controversy. What would Uncle Walt have made of the wild Jews from Queens, or their films-shockers such as The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, or Reservoir Dogs, with its famous ear-slicing sequence. Or even their huge hit, The Crying Game, with its jaw-dropping anatomical surprise? It seemed clear that this was a marriage of convenience, not affection, and most observers predicted it would end in a messy divorce. But the deal they struck was so advantageous to both companies that the simmering feud between the two took more than a decade to boil over. </p> <p>Miramax was coming off two lean years. To many Hollywood players it looked as if the company was on the edge of bankruptcy, and the Disney offer was a godsend. Eisner, too, was highly motivated. He had been uneasily watching his competitors get a foothold in television. Says Katzenberg: \"Michael did not want to buy cable, he did not want to buy a network, because he felt we were too late. Our strategy was to extend our reach in terms of content. If we had a large enough control of the product being made, these so-called gatekeepers - the Rupert Murdochs, the Viacoms, the Time Warners that did own cable and network - would always have to deal with us. Miramax was the big building block in that strategy.\" It went beyond that, explains Chris McGurk, who was CFO at the time. \"We'd had a couple of years of poor performance and he probably saw Harvey as a backstop.\" </p> <p>For Disney, one of the most attractive things about Miramax was its business plan. \"The big cost in the movie business, once you've made the movie, is how much you spend on TV advertising, and they just didn't do that,\" says Joe Roth, who would become chairman of Disney after Katzenberg left in 1994. \"What they were brilliant at was not going into the field and spending $20m on TV until they knew it was going to work. So they didn't have movies that lost $30m, $40m, whereas other studios have four or five of them a year. And every year they had some kind of a breakout.\" </p> <p>From an economic standpoint, everything seemed to make sense right off the bat. Says McGurk: \"We laid out on a piece of paper how we would help Miramax take over the independent world and kill everybody.\" </p> <p>The deal was signed in the conference room of the Team Disney building. All told, it was worth something over $100m to Miramax. The Weinsteins were guaranteed autonomy. As Harvey puts it: \"If we lived within a cap of $12.5m per picture, nobody could tell us what to do.\" According to one source, when he returned to his New York office, he told the staff: \"I finally found someone to buy this shithole!\" </p> <p>But it wasn't long before the relationship between Disney and Miramax turned rocky. To Miramax, the Disney executives came off as arrogant suits. Jack Foley, the Weinsteins' distribution head recalls: \"You had this efficiency machine at Disney coming over into chaosville, saying, 'This is what you should do.' They put an audit on us, and the Disney auditors were truly the most Draconian, Machiavellian, Kafkaesque bureaucrats you'd ever want to meet in your life. They were trying to bash us.\" </p> <p>On the Disney side, almost everyone with whom the Weinsteins dealt, especially the middle-level executives, regarded them as little better than dog hair. McGurk says: \"Miramax was set up to be an autonomous business that lived outside the rules. To Disney executives they were this outlaw company that leeched off the Disney divisions and made the executives look bad because they were doing so well, so they hated that.\" Roth adds: \"Miramax acted like Disney was just another company, and to [them], it felt like they were being forced to support a competitor.\" </p> <p>Not only were Disney forced to piggyback Miramax product on to their own, they disliked the product, so different from what they were used to. Says one former Disney executive: \"Their packaging sucked; the trailers sucked; there was no awareness of their pictures, because they were never distributed in the small towns between the coasts. Plus, Bob and Harvey were disagreeable sons of bitches to talk to over the phone. If you're a salesman at Buena Vista Home Video, and your bonus is based on how much you sell, do you want to push The Lion King? Or do you want to push The Cook, the Thief? Their video business was like a booger on your finger that you couldn't flick off!\" </p> <p>At first, Eisner supported Harvey but, says Roth: \"They were enough alike to really not get along. They had some pretty big fights.\" As former Disney CFO Rob Moore puts it: \"People who did stuff for them, they liked, and people who didn't do stuff for them, they hated. You were their best friend or they wanted to run you over. There was no grey area with them.\" The Weinsteins showed up at a corporate retreat one year wearing T-shirts that read \"corporately irresponsible\", which pretty well summed up their attitude. </p> <p>In 1995, Miramax acquired a film, Priest, about a gay Catholic priest, which created a firestorm of protest: anti-semitic hate letters, death threats etc. Harvey had planned to release it on Good Friday. Some Disney executives were reportedly furious that Miramax had acquired the film in the first place, knowing they couldn't release an NC-17 movie. They took it personally. As one says: \"He was doing it just to fuck with Michael. I believe that they got extreme pleasure out biting the hand that fed them. Psychologically, it makes them think that they're still independent, that they didn't sell out to a large conglomerate. But they did. They traded money for freedom.\" Adds Roth: \"We had a couple of years - 1994, 95 - when it was rough going. The amount of controversy that was connected up to Disney was terrible. There was definitely a conversation about how do you continue a business and make a profit when you are so connected to these two guys.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, despite the spats - the raised voices, thrown dishes, and slammed doors - Miramax was making money, winning Oscars and beefing up its library. As Moore puts it: \"Miramax was delivering, and Disney was delivering.\" Both sides had strong incentives to make the arrangement work. Disney understood that without the Weinsteins, Miramax was just an empty shell. For their part, the brothers knew that Disney owned the ground they stood on, which is to say, the name and the library, and that financing them from scratch would be an expensive proposition for any other studio. </p> <p>Besides, their deal was structured so that if they were to walk, they would be leaving too much money on the table. They were milking the Disney cow in too many ways. At one point - after Priest, and then Kids, another controversial film - McGurk went to Eisner and asked: \"Hey, do you want me to go and sell Miramax? Because I would love to get a multiple of 10 on what we paid for it.\" Eisner responded: \"As long as I'm around, we're never selling that company.\" McGurk explains: \"He thought that they had built one of the best brands in the business, so all that talk of leaving was baloney, on both sides. Look what Disney did with their business. They couldn't get arrested from a profit standpoint before Disney bought them, and now they're making $150m a year.\" </p> <p>Cut to the early years of the new millennium, when the uneasy relationship between Eisner and Harvey had exploded into open warfare. What had changed? For one thing, Harvey's success had made him more ambitious. After the run of $100m hits in the middle of the 1990s, such as Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, Good Will Hunting, and Shakespeare in Love, Weinstein was no longer content to make small films that made small profits. He spoke directly about competing with the studios. On the last weekend of January, 1999, Miramax released She's All That, starring Freddie Prinze Jr, and won the weekend. According to director Kevin Smith, \"Harvey was incredibly proud\" of She's All That. He told Eisner: \"I wanted to prove to them that I could make a piece of shit and compete on their level. And I did.\" </p> <p>Ironically, it was Eisner who brought him up short, telling him that he should have released it through Dimension, Bob Weinstein's genre label. It was not a Miramax movie. Eisner had a substantial investment in the Miramax name, and he knew that Harvey's ego had committed a crime against the brand that was stupid and potentially costly. </p> <p>Eisner recognised that Harvey was not only doing the independent world a disservice, he was also sabotaging himself. By virtue of going toe-to-toe with the studios, Harvey began to deny himself the very advantages that had contributed to Miramax's success in the past. As McGurk puts it: \"The original business model was founded on them doing movies where the total investment was less than $15m, and generally less than $10m. If they found a diamond in the rough, like The English Patient, they could spend a lot of money on marketing and their overall investment would still be lower than the average. Now the average cost of a Miramax movie has got to be $30m, $40m, $50m. As they've gotten bigger and bigger, the old model might just as well be thrown in the waste basket.\" </p> <p>Harvey went on to lose at least $37m on Talk magazine, a venture he started in the face of Eisner's fierce opposition. He also financed a series of substantially budgeted, studio-type movies such as Kate and Leopold at $50-odd million, and Cold Mountain - essentially a story about a man walking home through the woods that could have been shot by the old Miramax for $2m - for more than $80m. Harvey even optioned the Green Hornet comic strip, which he intended as his very own Spider-Man. </p> <p>Nobody likes a loser, which is what Harvey was fast becoming. He went through a long drought, from Shakespeare in Love in 1998 to Chicago in 2003, producing a series of high-profile duds such as The Shipping News and Gangs of New York. Bob Weinstein was making the money, but even he was running out of steam. Meanwhile, Eisner was having his own troubles: Katzenberg's humiliating lawsuit, launched after he was denied promotion, which Eisner was forced to settle out of court for about $250m; the Mike Ovitz debacle and ensuing suit from stockholders, who were furious that Ovitz was hired and fired at great expense within 14 months; plunging profits at Disney; and a campaign to get rid of Eisner himself, run by Walt's nephew Roy Disney.Eisner and Harvey, like two wounded grizzly bears, turned on each other. </p> <p>The Weinsteins, who have always thought they could do a better job running Disney than Eisner and his team, became openly critical of the CEO's judgement, starting with his refusal to let Miramax produce Lord of the Rings. \"Let's not forget who was the guy who believed in it first,\" says Harvey, speaking of himself in the third person, \"and to his detriment couldn't get his own company to back his vision. With the way they exploit theme parks, that one decision cost the company maybe a billion dollars.\" </p> <p>The Weinsteins have been operating within an annual $700m budget cap. According to Harvey, Disney tried to lower the cap to $500m, in part by changing the formula by which foreign sales can be used to offset costs. From the Weinsteins' point of view, Disney started to nickel-and-dime them. \"They're in financial trouble, and they're trying to renegotiate the deal,\" Harvey says. It has always killed the Weinsteins to share the profits with anyone - agents, producers, investors, film-makers or employees - and this must have been doubly true of Disney. As Cassian Elwes, an agent, says: \"I'm sure at the back of their minds is that nagging thought that had they managed to remain independent and had the success that they've had over the last eight years, they'd be billionaires as opposed to multi-millionaires.\" </p> <p>Eisner ordered an audit of Miramax books in 2002 - such audits are annoying, if fairly common - but the Weinsteins retaliated by hiring two high-powered attorneys, Bert Field and David Boies, to find legal grounds for a counter-audit of the Disney books pertaining to their video and international TV distribution of Miramax product. \"They get to see my books all the time, so there's no hiding what we do,\" says Harvey. \"On the flip side, Bob and I's pay is determined by accounting from Disney. I don't get to see everything unless I ask for an audit.\" Disney claims that Miramax has only been profitable two out of the past five years, which Miramax denies. </p> <p>The Fahrenheit 9/11 brouhaha (Miramax claimed that Disney refused to allow it to release the film), along with the ensuing success of Michael Moore's film, were pawns in Miramax's ongoing struggle with Disney. Both sides have, of course, been as busy as spiders spinning the story, with Miramax touting unnamed investors who are on the verge of buying their company for them, while Disney, with an eye to the stockholders' suit, maintains that it is ready to entertain legitimate offers. But it has always seemed unlikely that Eisner would sell the Miramax name and library - the company's two biggest assets - back to the hated Weinstein brothers. And for their part, life outside the Disney umbrella seems like a grim prospect. Moreover, raising the kind of equity that would keep them in the lifestyle to which they've become accustomed seems equally questionable. Besides, most of the reports of a Miramax buyout have come from the Weinstein's assets in the New York press. That is, it seems likely that Miramax has planted them to pressure Disney into backing off. </p> <p>The latest rumour - Bob Weinstein stays at Disney with Miramax, while Harvey becomes an independent producer, releasing through his brother - sounds more plausible. After all, Bob, with his eye on the bottom line, seems more in line with the Disney mentality, while Harvey is very much of a loose cannon. If Harvey can raise enough private equity to set himself up like Joe Roth at Revolution, he might indeed be able to partner with the studios in Dumbo-sized movies. </p> <p>But we're talking a lot of money here, as much as $500-$700m a year. True, there seems to be an endless supply of billionaires just dying to blow their cash in the film business, so it's conceivable that Harvey can bag his pigeons. Plus, he's on a roll, what with Fahrenheit 9/11 and Zhang Yimou's Hero, which has succeeded in spite of him. (He overpaid for it and then shelved it for two years.) But it won't be easy. </p> <p>Besides, many studio bosses have seriously mixed feelings about the Miramax co-chairman, and may be reluctant to get in bed with him. MGM, run by old Weinstein friend McGurk, seemed like a likely partner, but that studio has fallen to Sony. Moreover, Harvey won't be putting out 40 pictures a year any more, and with a severely downsized slate of releases - expensive ones at that - he'll be taking a studio-sized risk on every one. In other words, Harvey did manage to embarrass Eisner with Fahrenheit 9/11, but he may yet pay a high price, which may be the reason he now seems to be weighing his options once again. With Eisner announcing his exit from his CEO post in 2006, and under pressure from his enemies to leave sooner, why not hang in and wait him out - although it's far from clear that his successor, whoever it is, will regard Harvey any more favourably. Meanwhile, Miramax has been shedding dead skin like a snake, ostensibly with the object of convincing Disney that it is a for real profitable business. But this may be a case of too little, too late. </p> <p>For beleaguered New York Mets baseball fans, the best-case scenario has him quitting the film business while he's ahead (he's already got his Oscar and more money than he can spend in a slew of lifetimes), and buying out the team's clueless owners, as he has said he'd love to do. It probably wouldn't take him more than a year or two for him to get them into the World Series, facing George Steinbrenner's Yankees - winners of the title four times in the past 10 years. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Peter Biskind is the author of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.

[Chuckles] You are such a s**t, I can't believe you were bluffing. [Addresses anyone within earshot] The way he was betting, it wasn't even normal, and he had nothing. </p> <p><strong> Two threes go a long way. </strong><br> He beat me because I was bluffing him and betting very aggressively, and normally they bail out. If we were playing for money I'm sure you wouldn't have been so frivolous.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, yeah...</strong><br> Oh yeah, the most that I have ever won in a hand is about 35 Gs.</p> <p><strong>What's that, Snoop Dogg?</strong><br> $35,000.</p> <p><strong>The most you've ever lost? </strong><br> That I don't know.</p> <p><strong> What tip would you give someone like Small Talk who knows nothing about poker? </strong><br> I would say you'd better play a bit more conservatively.</p> <p><strong>Or else?</strong><br> Especially when you're a beginner. I mean you know that, you'd probably play so differently if you were playing for real money. Right? </p> <p><strong>Right you are. Now, down to business. What's your favourite sport? </strong><br> Um, I love all sports. I love snow: skiing, that's my favourite, and water-skiing. </p> <p><strong>Are there any teams you support? </strong><br> The Lakers. [Notices Small Talk tutting] I know, I am from LA.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest sporting achievement? </strong><br> We had the Olympics in school; I don't know if you have that over here - I won the gold medal in three events.</p> <p><strong>Crumbs... </strong><br> It was the javelin, and we had the cross-country: we had to run, like, six miles. Trust me, I couldn't do it now, I am the worst at running. No, it was only two medals, then.</p> <p><strong> What's your favourite colour? </strong><br> Green.</p> <p><strong>Natural tan, fake tan, or sunbed tan? </strong><br> [Quick as a flash] Fake tan.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite biscuit?</strong><br> I don't really have one. I don't really eat biscuits.</p> <p><strong>Cheese or chocolate? </strong><br> Both.</p> <p><strong> At the same time? </strong><br> OK, if I had to pick one or the other, probably cheese.</p> <p><strong>Pitt or Timberlake? </strong><br> [Demonstratively] Hands down, Pitt. He is soooooooo much more fit. I mean what would you say?</p> <p><strong>We're not in the best position to judge.</strong><br> Definitely Pitt. There's no comparison.</p> <p><strong>Mullets on men - yes or no?</strong><br> [Quizzical] What's that?</p> <p><strong>Mullets. You must know what a mullet is? [Small Talk launches into elaborate, mane-stroking explanation] </strong><br> Mullets on men? That's a bit quirky, I guess it's alright.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite drink? </strong><br> Double vanilla vodka and diet coke.</p> <p><strong> What would you put in Room 101? </strong><br> Is it like a reject room?</p> <p><strong>Yeah, kind of. </strong><br> [Giggles] I'd put Timberlake. </p> <p><strong>Harsh. What's your favourite film? </strong><br> Overboard. Have you seen it? With Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. It's so funny; they're brilliant. That and Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett. I love her, she's amazing.</p> <p><strong>What's the last CD you bought? </strong><br> Journey's Greatest Hits.</p> <p><strong>Whose? </strong><br> Journey? You guys don't know Journey?</p> <p><strong>What are they like? 70s or something?</strong><br> No. They were big in the 80s. I guess only in America.</p> <p><strong>They probably have mullets. </strong><br> Oh, then I love them.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite TV show? </strong><br> Probably Jackass. Top show.</p> <p><strong> How much do you pay for a haircut, and what do you ask for? </strong><br> I don't pay anything, because my mum cuts my hair.</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong><br> Only my mum cuts my hair.</p> <p><strong>What's the most you've spent on an item of clothing? </strong><br> I don't really spend a lot on clothing. Maybe $500.</p> <p><strong>We expected five figures... </strong><br> No, I'd rather save my money and buy houses or cars - it's more of an investment. Clothes come and go, and a lot of the time I'm really fortunate and people give me gear, so why would I go out and spend it?</p> <p><strong>Fair enough. </strong><br> I mean, I'll buy a nice coat or something, but I just wear jeans and a T-shirt unless I have a la-la event. If that's the case then they give me the clothes.</p> <p><strong>What was the last film you saw? </strong><br> The Passion Of The Christ, and I hated it and I walked out. Did you see it?</p> <p><strong>No chance.</strong><br> It was the worst film I've ever seen. All it was was Jesus Christ being absolutely, completely, mercilessly...</p> <p><strong>... battered like a drunken fish? </strong><br> I mean it was horrible.</p> <p><strong> What phrase or word do you use most?</strong><br> Do you know what I use all the time? </p> <p><strong>Nope, henc...</strong><br> [Launches into alarmingly cockneyish drawl] Dyakna'tImean?</p> <p><strong>Very EastEnders. </strong><br> I use it all the time.</p> <p><strong>Do you watch any English soap operas? Hollyoaks?</strong><br> I <em>did</em> Hollyoaks. That was really fun. [Adopts embryonic leer] The guys were really fit actually.</p> <p><strong> If you could have any kind of food right now, what would it be?</strong><br> [Lightning fast] A double-cheese pizza with jalapeno peppers.</p> <p><strong>Where are you off to after this? </strong><br> [Weary sigh] Another interview.</p> <p><strong>Oof.
