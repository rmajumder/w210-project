  "<p>You're at the supermarket, staring at a gaudy edifice of chocolate. At eye level are big, cheap slabs whose brand names you recognise from every bus shelter poster and TV advert. Slightly higher up is a smaller bar wrapped in dark paper, proclaiming its name, Green &amp; Black's, in the kind of faintly aristocratic typeface you might see on a National Trust letterhead. Two small logos strike you on the packaging: the familiar Soil Association organic swirl and a more unusual waving silhouette of the Fairtrade Foundation. </p> <p>You weigh up the cost, and toss the Green &amp; Black's into your trolley. But why? Is it because you know the high cocoa content represents good-quality chocolate? Is it because the organic stamp makes this bar appear healthier than the others? Or do you imagine that you are genuinely doing a favour for some distant, toiling, impoverished cocoa farmer? Whatever the reason, you are not alone. The Fairtrade mark is 10 years old this year, and sales are soaring. Some \u00a363m of Fairtrade foods are sold annually, an increase of 90% within the past two years. For the Fairtrade ideal, a tipping point has clearly just been passed. We are shopping with our heart as well as our stomach. </p> <p>The first Fairtrade product in the UK was Green &amp; Black's Maya Gold chocolate. It is perhaps no coincidence that this is where the idea started. More than any other food, when we buy a bar of chocolate, we buy a set of associations. Our choice of chocolate is as much about competing marketing strategies as it is about taste. Green &amp; Black's offers us a new idea, a new self-image, an ethically better self, to impose on the tabula rasa of cocoa. This strategy is working extremely well, with Green &amp; Black's annual turnover rising from \u00a34.5m to \u00a313m in the past two years. </p> <p>Green &amp; Black's success may owe something to the anti-globalisation movement, and the increasing acceptance of the anti-multinational philosophy. But what does the Fairtrade logo, with its vague promise to \"guarantee a better deal for third-world producers\", really mean? And do we care? Or do we buy into the Fairtrade brand for the same reason some buy Nike trainers - because it's cool? I decided that the only way to find out if the Fairtrade image is based on any kind of fact was to go and meet the farmers. I wouldn't take on trust the message of the logo; I'd track a bar of chocolate to its source and find out if a producer in the developing world really was seeing any benefit. </p> <p>Maya Gold is produced using cocoa grown by Mayan farmers in Toledo, an impoverished jungle region of southern Belize. With a decade of Fairtrade behind them, these farmers would know if Fairtrade really was fair, and if it had made a difference to anyone's life. </p> <p>The roads in Toledo are so bad that I fly there in a tiny propeller plane. For 45 minutes we fly over uninterrupted jungle, with the odd citrus plantation or shrimp farm the only signs of human life. I am greeted at the airstrip by Gregor Hargrove, project manager for Green &amp; Black's in Belize. He's a tall, middle-aged Canadian, the former owner of a sustainable forestry business. He sold it, then retired for two weeks before boredom drove him to Belize, where a variety of aid jobs eventually led him to his current post. </p> <p>We head into Punta Gorda, capital of the Toledo district, to look around the shabby but bustling Green &amp; Black's office, staffed by two young Mayans. Punta Gorda doesn't feel like a lucky town. One dusty street has all the town's shops, with a small grid of deteriorating roads and tumbledown shacks huddling between the sea and the low, brushy jungle that somehow looks poised to devour the suburbs. </p> <p>Early the following morning, we drive out of Punta Gorda in a battered Range Rover. As we head into the interior, the roads narrow to thin, muddy tracks, and a series of sparse but neat Mayan villages begin to appear among the otherwise dense jungle foliage. </p> <p>As a test case for the relative fairness of international trade, Mayan cocoa farmers are curiously appropriate. The cocoa tree is indigenous to this region of Central America. Two thousand years ago, a thriving Mayan civilisation revered the cocoa tree as a sacred plant, and Mayan priests were the first to roast and grind the seeds of the cocoa pod, producing the drink \"chocolatl\", used in religious rituals. </p> <p>Even then, cocoa was a cash crop, the seeds traded for gold, silver, turquoise, maize, oil, beans, incense and cotton. One Mayan document valued a slave at 100 cocoa beans. When the Spanish took cocoa back to Europe in the 17th century, drinking chocolate became an exclusive luxury for the elite of society. Then, in the late 1800s, a Dutchman, Van Houten, invented the cocoa press, which could separate the ground beans into cocoa powder and cocoa butter. This development made a smoother drink and allowed for an altered balance of powder and butter. This, in turn, led to the invention of the chocolate bar. </p> <p>Van Houten's press was first brought to Britain by a certain Mr Cadbury, and soon chocolate became an affordable, popular treat. Unlike tea, or the potato - once hailed as exotic aphrodisiacs but now as mundane as a slice of bread - chocolate, despite being on sale in every garage and corner shop, has somehow retained a whiff of magic. </p> <p>But while chocolate took over the world, the Mayans were left behind. The majority of the world's cocoa is now grown on densely planted, heavily fertilised and pesticide-sprayed plantations in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Malaysia and Brazil. As a global force in the production of their native plant, the Mayans are now nonentities. In Belize, they are the poorest of the poor, most living by subsistence farming. </p> <p>Jeronimo Tush, one of the more successful cocoa farmers in the area, has been selling to Green &amp; Black's for a decade. He greets me with an intensely serious courtesy, and we sit on the concrete porch of his small, solidly built home, overlooking his 30 acres of land, half of which he actively farms. He has dedicated 10 acres to citrus and six acres to cocoa. </p> <p>For a 49-year-old farmer with nine children, Tush looks remarkably young, healthy and content. I ask him how his life has changed since he began selling cocoa to Green &amp; Black's. \"I used to live in a thatch hut with a mud floor. Now I have two concrete houses. And I have been able to educate my children. Sophia is at university in Belmopan [the capital of Belize] and Laurence is a teacher. They had to work in a shrimp farm when they were younger, but my children now only go to school. We don't need them to work.\" </p> <p>Is this because of the Fairtrade price he has been receiving for his cocoa? He shakes his head. \"It is from cocoa and citrus.\" </p> <p>\"And is your citrus sold at a Fairtrade price?\" </p> <p>\"No. At the market price.\" </p> <p>\"And is that a fair price?\" </p> <p>\"When you sell it, you still don't know the price, and you get three payments. One when you give them the fruit, one three months later, then three months after that you get a final payment. Only at the end do you find out what you are really getting.\" </p> <p>\"So is selling the cocoa much better? They pay a set price, and buy the whole crop for cash when you bring it in. Have you become richer just because of the cocoa?\" </p> <p>\"No. Cocoa and citrus.\" </p> <p>\"But is the Fairtrade cocoa much better?\" </p> <p>He shrugs. \"Cocoa and citrus,\" he says. </p> <p>\"And if you had to sell the cocoa at the market price, would it make a big difference to you?\" </p> <p>\"No,\" he replies. </p> <p>Hargrove, who is sitting at a discreet distance, is now beginning to fidget. </p> <p>\"And is selling to Green &amp; Black's very different from other buyers?\" </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>\"In what way?\" </p> <p>\"They ask lots of questions about if it is organic.\" </p> <p>Hargrove suddenly can't keep quiet any longer. \"How much did you make from cocoa last year, Jeronimo?\" he asks. </p> <p>\"I can't remember.\" </p> <p>\"I remember,\" Hargrove says. \"It was 4,000 Belize dollars, wasn't it?\" That's about \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Tush thinks for a while, and then accepts the figure. Pressed, he also comes up with a figure for his citrus - roughly \u00a3450. Only when he is reminded that he is making more than twice as much money from just over half the land will he acknowledge that cocoa is a far better crop. \"I am going to expand the cocoa. It is better,\" he reluctantly concedes. </p> <p>We are still on the topic when Tush's nephew arrives; Adolpho is a local schoolteacher with better English than his uncle. With Adolpho questioning Tush about his crops and translating the answers, it emerges that Tush spends more than \u00a3400 on pesticides and fertilisers for his citrus each year. </p> <p>\"So he made no money from his citrus last year?\" </p> <p>No. </p> <p>\"So why doesn't he get rid of the citrus and just grow cocoa?\" </p> <p>This question gets a shrug, and the only laugh I ever hear from Tush. </p> <p>Adolpho, with a wry smile, translates this by saying, \"He won't. He won't get rid of the citrus. He is a farmer. He likes to work.\" </p> <p>In terms of aid, or of Fairtrade, Tush represents the end of the line. He is the illiterate son of a subsistence farmer, keen to give his children a better life than his own. He is the ideal of the person whom Fairtrade has set out to help. And if it were easy, the aid organisations would have already managed to help him. </p> <p>Tush was a penniless, homeless orphan at the age of 14, and without Green &amp; Black's he would probably still be living in a thatched hut, his children working on a shrimp farm. Yet his understanding of Fairtrade is only sketchy, and his comprehension of the extent to which his economic situation would be altered if he were left to the mercy of market forces is nonexistent. He is proud of what he grows. As to the price he gets for it, he seems to feel this is simply beyond him. </p> <p>Saul Garcia, a farmer, is also sanguine about his cocoa. He knows it is his most profitable crop, and he is planting 300 trees every year, but he also grows coffee, cashews, star fruit, oranges and coconuts. He tells me he has been selling his cocoa to Green &amp; Black's only since 1998, because he didn't trust them for the first five years. Now he is beginning to recognise that they will consistently pay a good price, and buy his whole crop. So he's recently begun putting more effort into cocoa. But with a tree taking five years to bear fruit, it will be a while before he sees the benefit. </p> <p>Meeting Garcia and Tush, you begin to understand that the Fairtrade guarantee is addressed less to the farmers than to the shoppers. Or at least, when it is addressed to the farmers, it is unlikely to impress them. A Fairtrade white man in a suit with a graph of prices and a table of yields and profits will look no different from other businessmen and aid workers who have gone before. And previous dealings with western cocoa interests more than explain the farmers' mistrust. </p> <p>Mayans have always grown cocoa for personal use, but the commercial farming of cocoa in Toledo has its origins in a USAid (US Agency for International Development) programme run in the 1980s. USAid's original Cocoa Development Project of Belize document, given out to Mayan farmers, makes for alarming reading. It proposes that these farmers abandon the native breed they have been growing for thousands of years in favour of a hybrid seed. Two models are then offered - low-input and high-input. Both involve the use of insecticide, fungicide, foliar fertiliser and granular fertiliser, all of which these previously organic farmers would have to buy at a price (probably by mortgaging their land, while they wait the five years until the trees bear fruit). The cost of these inputs is set against the price of cocoa, with a promise that \"demand for cocoa has been growing and is expected to continue to grow\". The document states that a farmer with 10 acres will stand to make a net profit of between US$3,900 and US$8,000, depending on whether they adopt the low- or high-input model. The US company Hershey, the farmers are told, \"will buy all cocoa at a fair price\". </p> <p>While it is true that demand for cocoa had been rising, there is no mention of the fact that supply had also been rising, and at a faster rate. As a result, prices had been in steady decline, with cocoa selling in 1987 for close to half the price of the previous decade. There was no reason to suppose this decline would cease - and it didn't. </p> <p>By the early 1990s, when the new trees were bearing fruit, the sums did not come out as USAid had predicted. The profits offered had been based on a calculation of 85 cents for a pound of cocoa. In 1993, Hershey offered 33.5 cents for each pound. After six years of work, these farmers now stood to make an out-and-out loss. Many didn't even bother to harvest the crop. In an area where 79% of the population live below the poverty line, the effect was devastating. </p> <p>In order to understand Fairtrade, one must first understand unfair trade. Justino Peck, chairman of the Toledo Cacao Growers Association, and a cocoa farmer himself, is still bitter about his experience with USAid. </p> <p>Craig Sams, co-founder and president of Green &amp; Black's, who was shortly to come to the rescue of the Toledo farmers, will not be drawn on the precise nature of the relationship between USAid and Hershey. \"The effect of these cocoa development projects was to diversify the areas in which it was grown, which contributed to the drop in price. I can't say what USAid's motives were, but though it was pitched as aid, the effect of the programme served the purposes of the big international cocoa buyers more than it served to help third-world cocoa farmers.\" </p> <p>Sams, who had recently visited a cocoa plantation in Belize \"out of curiosity\" while helping a cousin to film a documentary, was at that point branching out from his job running Whole Earth foods to found Green &amp; Black's. He had noted that the vast majority of the Belizean farmers had spurned (or been unable to afford) USAid's seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, but had mostly stuck to traditional organic farming of the indigenous cocoa. </p> <p>When Sams heard that the Toledo farmers had lost their American buyer, he had the idea for a new product: Maya Gold. He offered to buy the Toledo beans for 63 cents a pound - roughly 10% higher than the market rate at the time - and promised to continue buying at this price, year on year, regardless of dips in the market. His price would hold steady unless the market price rose, in which case he would adjust his price upwards to match (and exceed) it. This promise, originally made to Toledan cocoa farmers in November 1993, was to become the central plank of the Fairtrade philosophy. </p> <p>Ten years on, Sams has stood by his promise. He still buys every bean offered for sale in Toledo. While the world market oscillates wildly (40 cents a pound in 2000; 80 cents in 2002) he pays a set 89 cents for each pound. When the market price peaks above this level, he (and anyone else buying Fairtrade cocoa) pays the market rate plus roughly 10%. </p> <p>As shoppers, we will give our trust based on nothing more than the sight of a pretty logo. Years, decades even, are necessary to win the trust of farmers, whose every cocoa tree is grown using time and land that would otherwise be used to grow the family food supply. There is nothing dumb about this resistance. Scratching a living from 20 acres of jungle is no mean feat, with little leeway for error. If you don't want your family to go hungry, you had better be damn sure that any change is going to work. </p> <p>The defining principle of Fairtrade is summed up by the slogan \"Trade, not aid\". Green &amp; Black's is adamant that it is a business, not a charity, but its connection to this principle puts it somewhere between the two. The idea is not just that it is fairer than other trade, but also that it does more good than aid. </p> <p>While the Toledan farmers are hard to pin down on the relative fairness of different forms of trade, when it comes to aid, they have very clear opinions. Caytano Ico, secretary of the Toledo Cacao Growers Association, voices a typical opinion when he states, \"Aid is big business. There are over 40 aid agencies in Toledo. But [\u00a315m] has been spent here in the past 20 years and it has had no effect.\" </p> <p>Where has the money gone? </p> <p>\"Honest to God,\" he says, \"we don't know.\" </p> <p>In 2002, Belize Enterprise for Sustainable Technology interviewed 857 farmers, but could find no one who had received any \"tangible or sustained benefit\" from the various poverty relief programmes, which it estimated at \u00a35m over two decades. </p> <p>From each bar of Maya Gold chocolate, retailing at \u00a31.60 in the UK, a Toledo farmer will receive roughly 6p. The cocoa mass may be 55%, but the cocoa cost is nearer to 4%. When it comes to international trade, \"fair\" is a relative term. </p> <p>One morning in the Green &amp; Black's office in Punta Gorda, with various farmers coming and going, and a bar of Maya Gold in my hand, I ask the key question. If I am in Britain, and I have a choice between spending \u00a31.60 on this bar, from which they will earn 6p, or giving \u00a31.60 to an international aid charity, what should I do? </p> <p>Not one farmer hesitates: buy the chocolate. </p> <p>Gregor Hargrove says that scepticism about aid runs so deep in the area that one of the first points he makes when attempting to recruit new cocoa growers is that Green &amp; Black's is not a charity. \"'We are not here to help you. We are here to make a profit. We are a business.' It's something I always say. It's very important for winning their trust.\" </p> <p>When I ask the farmers if they think Fairtrade is fair, they all say yes. But there's nothing the Fairtrade Foundation can do about the extent to which the balance of power in international trade favours Europe over the developing world. Cocoa processing (crushing the beans to form cocoa powder and butter) is far more profitable than cocoa growing. EU import tariffs are zero on beans, but up to 9.6% on cocoa butter or paste. As a result, almost all processing takes place in Europe and North America. Amsterdam is the world's busiest cocoa port, and from imports of 250,000 tonnes of beans, it can expect to earn over $5bn in export sales. Meanwhile, from exports of 700,000 tonnes of beans, Ivory Coast can expect to earn no more than $7bn. </p> <p>The UK taxpayer supports Green &amp; Black's venture in Toledo via a \u00a3225,000 grant from the Department for International Development, intended to help the expansion of cocoa growing in the area. Yet when you consider that EU tariffs ensure the greater part of cocoa profits accrue to Europe, and calculate that VAT raises 28p from every bar of Maya Gold, against 6p for the growers, the net benefit is balanced heavily in favour of the British and European exchequers. At every turn, Europe profits, while the developing world is milked dry. Whatever the logo on the product, international trade will never be fair, and there's no western government that wants it to become fair. </p> <p>Yet, by comparison with the merry-go-round of international aid, the money from Fairtrade food passes through remarkably few hands on its way from your pocket to the pocket of a poor farmer. The sum may shrink hugely along the way, but a man in a concrete-floored shack of a Green &amp; Black's office in Punta Gorda really is out there, weighing sacks of beans and giving out cash, while his neighbours in carpeted aid offices down the street are writing proposals, attending committees and flying to conferences </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Sutcliffe's new novel, Bad Influence, is published by Hamish Hamilton at \u00a310.</p>",
  "<p>The expansion of the European Union and the increasingly global nature of international trade means there's never been a greater demand for good, well-qualified translators. And there has been a significant increase in recent years in the number of postgraduate translation courses offered by British universities.</p> <p>For example, the University of Manchester offers an MA in translation studies which attracts students from Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America. Maeve Olohan, senior lecturer and programme director, says: \"Translators often do much more than translate and may spend some or all of their time as terminologists (technical writers), revisers, editors, project managers or subtitlers.\"</p> <p>They also find employment in the software industry, or get involved in technical writing or multilingual publishing.</p> <p>\"Some of our students have gone into the well-known areas of translator employment like the European Commission, European Parliament and other large international organisations. But many work for smaller commercial companies in Britain and abroad,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Some work in-house, others are freelance. Some of our earlier graduates have set up their own companies and consultancies or are translation managers. Some continued their studies to PhD level and are now involved in training translators in Britain and abroad.\"</p> <p>Translators may spend time as technical writers, revisors, editors, project managers or subtitlers. With a range of different courses available, it's important to choose one which specialises in the language and technical field that you are interested in. The University of Newcastle's School of Modern Languages offers a two-year postgraduate programme with four options leading to MA degrees for graduates who aim to pursue a career in the field of translating and interpreting: there are separate MAs in interpreting, translating, translating and interpreting and translation studies.</p> <p>The programme, established in 1997, aims to give students professional competence in translating and/or interpreting. There's also the opportunity to go on to PhD level. Manchester University's Centre for Translation and Intercultural Studies aims to provide specialist training in various types of translation activity - including technical translation, audiovisual translation and literary translation.</p> <p>It's also designed to help students move gradually towards the world of work through practi- cal, real-life translation tasks. At the University of East Anglia, students who want a career as practising professional translators can choose the MA in applied translation studies. The course is designed to provide graduates with an insight into the process of translation and into the nature of language. It also enables them to progress to postgraduate research in translation studies or applied linguistics.</p> <p>On all these courses students need to have excellent language competence in English and one other language.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:marianne_curphey@yahoo.co.uk\">Marianne Curphey</a></p>",
  "<p>The number of bankruptcies has shot up to an all-time high with nearly 1,000 people a week buckling under the weight of the country's \u00a31 trillion debt mountain. </p> <p>With interest rates set to rise further, analysts are warning that bankruptcies will continue to increase. </p> <p>Last week the Bank of England revealed that the total debts held by Britons had topped the \u00a31 trillion mark for the first time, having doubled in only seven years. </p> <p>Official figures released yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry showed there were 11,214 individual insolvencies in England and Wales in the second quarter of this year, 8% more than in the first quarter, and a 29% increase on the same quarter of 2003. </p> <p>The figure is the highest quarterly tally since records began in 1960 and comes in spite of unemployment being at record lows and the economy growing strongly. </p> <p>A DTI official said the relentless rise in insolvencies was down to consumers rather than the self-employed. </p> <p>Patrick Boyden, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said bankruptcies were heading above 40,000 for the year as a whole, which would top the previous record of 36,000 set during the recession of the early 90s. </p> <p>\"UK consumers are buckling under the weight of a mountain of personal debt,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Record personal insolvency figures reveal the pressures on people who have borrowed to the extremes and are struggling to repay their debt.\" </p> <p>Mr Boyden said he thought the rise in bankruptcies was going to worsen because of the recent increases in interest rates, which would make it even more difficult for people to service their debts. </p> <p>\"These figures are at a level not seen before and the upward trend is likely to continue. In a rising interest rate environment the pressures on those who have borrowed to the hilt are unlikely to disappear soon.\" </p> <p>Robert Pick, a personal insolvency specialist at Grant Thornton, said: \"Personal insolvencies have now reached epidemic proportions.\" He said the typical bad debtor had a mortgage of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000, and credit and store card debt of \u00a350,000, often at interest rates of 20-30%. </p> <p>The Citizens Advice Bureau said its offices had never seen as many bad debt cases as they were experiencing now. </p> <p>\"Almost one in five of our cases concerns debt and that number has risen 44% over the last six years, even though that was a period of very low interest rates,\" said CAB spokesman Dan Levene. </p> <p>\"It is a problem which is snowballing,\" he said, pointing to the floods of credit offers with which banks bombard households every day. </p> <p>\"We are particularly concerned about how people who don't have a chance of paying back the debt are being targeted by some lenders,\" he said, adding that people should think very carefully about whether they could afford it before taking on more debt. </p> <p>By contrast, the latest government figures showed that companies are doing well from the strength of the economy. </p> <p>Company liquidations in the second quarter were 3,151, very similar to the first quarter's level and 17% down compared with a year earlier. </p> <p>\"We are seeing fewer businesses struggling as a benign economic climate sets in and companies are able to make use of vibrant private equity and lending markets,\" said David Hargrave, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>",
  "<p>Millions of people face higher monthly mortgage costs after this week's widely expected interest rate rise - the fifth since November. </p> <p>Many economists expect another rise before the end of the year, which will take the Bank of England base rate to 5%, with perhaps a further one or two 0.25% hikes likely in the first half of next year. </p> <p>But some experts reading the economic tea leaves say there were signs that interest rates may peak sooner, and lower, than some people had been expecting. </p> <p>So what's the advice to homebuyers and people looking to remortgage? </p> <p>Well, fixed-rate deals are looking good - several lenders recently cut their rates, and you can get two-year deals at 4.99%. A shorter fix would also mean you're not locked into an unattractive deal if interest rates do, indeed, peak relatively soon. But on the other hand, the cheapest discount tracker deals have pay rates around 4.24% even after this week's rise, which is a fair bit lower. </p> <p>And what does this week's rise mean for mortgage-holders? Abbey was the first major lender to announce it was passing on the full quarter-point rise. Its standard variable mortgage rate will increase by 0.25% to 6.75%, adding \u00a315.70 a month to a \u00a3100,000 repayment loan (up from \u00a3675.21 to \u00a3690.91). </p> <p>It's probably fair to say that only a minority of borrowers pay their lender's standard rate these days, with those on fixed rates unaffected. But there are millions on a base rate tracker and discounted rate deals who will feel the impact. </p> <p>Five interest rate rises since November mean a typical standard rate borrower with a \u00a3100,000 loan will be paying about \u00a377 a month more than a year ago. But some people, particularly more recent home-buyers who've taken on large mortgages and didn't opt for a fixed rate, will be paying well over a \u00a3100 a month more. </p> <p>Many people looking to take out a mortgage will be wondering what they should do. The choice between fixed versus discount/tracker boils down to your particular circumstances - ie, the state of your finances and where you think interest rates might be going. First-time buyers on tight budgets might well be advised to opt for a loan where the monthly payments are fixed so you are cushioned from any nasty shocks. </p> <p>People have become a lot more cautious during the last few months, according to Derby-based home loans broker Mortgage Advice Bureau, which estimates that 80%-90% of its clients are opting for a fixed-rate. </p> <p>However, there were some hints that interest rates might stop their upwards march relatively soon. </p> <p>The Bank of England's rate-setting committee noted there were signs that the housing market is starting to cool, while Ray Boulger at mortgage broker Charcol points out that money market \"swap rates,\" which govern the amount charged for fixed-rate deals, have been falling recently. </p> <p>The last few days have seen the arrival of a batch of 4.99% two-year fixed rate deals. If you can stump up a sizeable deposit, Halifax is offering a loan fixed at this rate until December 31, 2006, but it's for home-buyers, not remortgagers, and is only available up to 60% loan-to-value. It's often the case that people buying a new home get better deals. </p> <p>Britannia building society is offering a two-year, 4.99% fix, open to all. Minimum de posit is 5% but there is a \u00a3499 arrangement fee. </p> <p>Charcol is also doing a two-year deal at this rate, available to purchasers and remortgagers wanting at least \u00a3150,000. Minimum deposit is 15% and there are lender and booking fees totalling \u00a3470. </p> <p>Mr Boulger says: \"With the general expectation that the base rate will have peaked within two years, locking into a fixed rate for more than two or three years could be an expensive mistake.\" </p> <p>There are also some quite attractively priced discounted rate and base rate tracker deals around. Fellow broker Chase De Vere Mortgage Management is offering a deal pegged at 0.51% below the base rate for two years, giving a current pay rate of 4.24%. </p> <p>If the base rate peaks at 5.5% (ie, three more 0.25% rises), it would leave someone who took out a 4.24% tracker deal today paying 4.99% - as low as the best two-year fixes around today, says Simon Tyler at Chase De Vere. He also quite likes Derbyshire building society's five-year capped tracker. This is pegged at 0.75% above the Bank base rate, giving a pay rate of 5.5% after this week's rise, but it is capped at 5.99%. So what you pay won't go higher than this during the deal period. </p> <p>This week also saw the launch of a new \"green\" mortgage from Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society. It's a four-year fix with a rate of 5.64%, and for every one that's taken out, N&amp;P will plant enough trees to \"offset\" the carbon dioxide emissions caused by using fossil fuels in the home. </p> <p>It's available to homebuyers and remortgagers with a minimum 10% deposit, and there is a free energy survey for \"second-hand\" homes (as opposed to brand-new). </p> <p><strong>And savers quickly feel the benefit</strong></p> <p>Banks and building societies have often been slow to pass on interest rate rises to their savers. But things seem to be changing for the better. This week several big players were quick off the mark in announcing details of the increases to their savings rates. </p> <p><strong>Abbey</strong> said it was increasing interest rates across all accounts by a minimum of 0.25%, in line with this week's quarter-point base rate rise. Customers with its monthly saver account will enjoy a bumper 0.5% increase, taking the rate to 5%.

  "<p>The expansion of the European Union and the increasingly global nature of international trade means there's never been a greater demand for good, well-qualified translators. And there has been a significant increase in recent years in the number of postgraduate translation courses offered by British universities.</p> <p>For example, the University of Manchester offers an MA in translation studies which attracts students from Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America. Maeve Olohan, senior lecturer and programme director, says: \"Translators often do much more than translate and may spend some or all of their time as terminologists (technical writers), revisers, editors, project managers or subtitlers.\"</p> <p>They also find employment in the software industry, or get involved in technical writing or multilingual publishing. </p> <p>\"Some of our students have gone into the well-known areas of translator employment like the European Commission, European Parliament and other large international organisations. But many work for smaller commercial companies in Britain and abroad,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Some work in-house, others are freelance. Some of our earlier graduates have set up their own companies and consultancies or are translation managers. Some continued their studies to PhD level and are now involved in training translators in Britain and abroad.\"</p> <p>With a range of different courses available, it's important to choose one which specialises in the language and technical field that you are interested in. The University of Newcastle's School of Modern Languages offers a two-year postgraduate programme with four options leading to MA degrees for graduates who aim to pursue a career in the field of translating and interpreting: there are separate MAs in interpreting, translating, translating and interpreting and translation studies.</p> <p>The programme, established in 1997, aims to give students professional competence in translating and/or interpreting. There's also the opportunity to go on to PhD level.</p> <p>Manchester University's Centre for Translation and Intercultural Studies aims to provide specialist training in various types of translation activity - including technical translation, audiovisual translation and literary translation. It's also designed to help students move gradually towards the world of work through practical, real-life translation tasks.</p> <p>At the University of East Anglia, students who want a career as practising professional translators can choose the MA in applied translation studies. The course is designed to provide graduates with an insight into the process of translation and into the nature of language. It also enables them to progress to postgraduate research in translation studies or applied linguistics.</p> <p>On all these courses students need to have excellent language competence in English and one other language. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:marianne_curphey@yahoo.co.uk\"> marianne_curphey@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Increasing numbers of unprovoked shark attacks on swimmers could be linked to the formation of immense oxygen-starved dead zones in the world's oceans, according to American scientists. </p> <p>Three people have been bitten by sharks off the Texas coast this year, compared to only 18 attacks in the past 24 years, leading researchers to believe they may be linked to a dead zone which this year has spread across 5,800 square miles (15,020 sq km) of the Gulf of Mexico . </p> <p>The zone, caused by the runoff of sewage and nitrate-based fertilisers from intensive farming, is deprived of oxygen and kills all fish within it. It also forces marine life near it to seek better water and come closer inshore. The one in the Gulf of Mexico this year is much closer to shore. </p> <p>Terry Stelly, an ecosystem biologist with the Texas parks and wildlife department, said increasing numbers of sharks had been recorded in recent years in the waters along the Texas-Louisiana border, near the edge of the dead zone. \"The chances are good they [sharks] are looking for higher dissolved oxygen in the water\", he said. </p> <p>Nancy Rabalais, of Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium said: \"The higher number of sharks in shallow waters may very likely be due to the low oxygen being close to the shore at the time of the attacks. The available habitat for the sharks is definitely less when the low oxygen is so widespread.\" </p> <p>According to the UN environment programme (Unep), there could now be more than 150 dead zones around the world: more than twice as many as 15 years ago. The largest are off the coasts of South America, China, Japan, south-east Australia and New Zealand. </p> <p>The number of unprovoked shark attacks has also risen in the same period, but this is usually attributed to the growth of tourism in shark-infested regions. </p> <p>The Gulf of Mexico's dead zone this year extends 250 miles (400km) west from the mouth of the Mississippi river in south-eastern Louisiana to near the Texas border. </p> <p>Its size varies each year depending on weather conditions but averages about 5,000 square miles (12,950 sq km) and remains in place until late September or early October. </p> <p>Almost nothing is being done to stop the flow of nitrates into the river. </p> <p>Klaus Toepfer, Unep's executive director, said: \"Humankind is engaged in a gigantic experiment as a result of the inefficient ... over-use of fertilisers, the discharge of untreated sewage and the ever-rising emissions from vehicles and factories. </p> <p>\"The nitrogen and phosphorous from these sources are being discharged into the environment, triggering sometimes irreversible effects.\"</p>",

  "It might be that one of the worst blows ever delivered to our fragile system of international law and order happened a few months ago when, on June 2, five members of a M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) team were murdered in northern Afghanistan. <p>The Taliban has claimed responsibility for those deaths. Yet, given the media's fascination with all that happens in Iraq and its focus on the US presidential elections, this event received far too little attention, as does the steady collapse of law and order in Afghanistan itself.</p> <p>These assassinations, and the subsequent withdrawal of MSF from Afghanistan, could have a far-reaching effect.</p> <p>To understand why, it is necessary to understand MSF's importance in world affairs. This extraordinary organization was founded by a group of French doctors in 1971 to provide emergency medical assistance during wartime and in crisis areas. </p> <p>Currently, it has around 2,500 volunteers (including doctors, nurses and technical support), joined by roughly 15,000 local staff across the globe. MSF, active in 80 countries, goes into places where angels fear to tread. </p> <p>Being one of the first non-governmental organisations to go into troubled zones - such as western Sudan - MSF draws international attention to burgeoning crises. It will also go into countries after the fighting is over to pick up the pieces, so to speak. </p> <p>MSF is usually welcomed by all sides in a dispute or a famine because its intentions are so transparent - to bring medical services, food supplies and sanitation. Its charter proudly states that its volunteers \"are aware of the risk and dangers of the mission they undertake, and have no right to compensation for themselves or their beneficiaries other than what M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res is able to afford them.\" </p> <p>While MSF strives to avoid taking sides, it is not bound to political neutrality in word and deed, like the international committee of the Red Cross. For example, in 1999 - the same year that MSF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize - the group's chairman openly appealed to the then Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, to stop the bombing of civilians in Chechnya. </p> <p>Before announcing its decision - after much agonising - to withdraw its 80 foreign volunteers from Afghanistan and dismiss its 1,400 local staff, MSF had worked in the country for 24 years. The group had become famous decades earlier by bringing medicine to stricken Afghan communities by packhorse and mules.</p> <p>It is hard to read about this withdrawal without shedding a tear. And, as I write this piece, the word comes in that MSF is scaling down its work in neighboring Pakistan because of worries over imitation attacks. </p> <p>So two poor and populous countries in great need of the MSF's unselfish work are now made to suffer from calculated extremist attacks. And other relief organizations are also considering pulling out of Afghanistan. Overall, 30 relief workers were killed in the country during the first six months of this year. Why can't this be headline news?</p> <p>That, alas, is not the worst of it. The MSF deaths, and the organisation's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, point to two big questions about international peace and security in the 21st century. </p> <p>The first is whether any international relief group (devoted to human rights, women's issues, the environment, childcare) that has its headquarters in New York, Paris, Geneva or Vienna can avoid the suspicion that it is just another form of western intrusion in a troubled land - and thus be denounced and attacked by malcontents. </p> <p>Are not German religious and relief workers in distraught Kosovo part of a NATO plot? Is not the news that Tony Blair has asked the British chiefs of staff to prepare plans to send a military contingent to Darfur to stop the dreadful genocide just another demonstration of the west's continuing imperialistic ambitions? </p> <p>To many of us, these seem totally absurd suspicions. Yet, when one learns of MSF's complaints that the US military had badly mixed its role in Afghanistan with those of the civilian aid groups - by distributing relief to communities that would offer intelligence and also by sometimes wearing civilian clothes - one cannot be completely surprised at the local response, even if it was carried out by extremists. </p> <p>This leads to the most disturbing question of all: can the UN, the great and small powers that are central members of it, and the agencies that report to and support it, maintain the current assumption that a distinction can be made between its \"hard\" work (peace enforcement, chapter seven operations, eliminating rogue states) and its \"soft\" work (rebuilding economies and helping the distressed, wounded, displaced and other victims of conflict and disaster)? </p> <p>In most past peacekeeping operations, that was a reasonable assumption. Local antagonists would be very willing, as in Mogadishu in 1993, to damage the UN's (or the delegated US's) armed forces. But neutral, philanthropic and church-based organisations on the ground were rarely assaulted. That is no longer the case. </p> <p>Why? The answer is perfectly plain. For some years now, scholars in what is called the \"security community\" (ie those who think about war and peace) have been discussing the problem of asymmetrical warfare.</p> <p>The logic chain goes like this: The US is in such a dominant position in terms of traditional military power (right now, it may well be spending one-half of the world's total defence expenditure) that its various foes are not going to attack it in a battle of Midway manner, big fleet against big fleet. </p> <p>No, they will attack the US in a sneaky, underhand way, as in 9/11. They will attack the nation's weak points, not its strengths. This is why there are large cement blocks outside the New York Stock Exchange and checks on trucks going up and down the coasts, and why people take off their shoes at airports. </p> <p>This is why the US is demanding that its new embassy in Berlin should be in an area totally open on all sides (never mind the historic district that will be obliterated).</p> <p>But abroad, generally, and in the Middle East, in particular, where both the present US administration and its Democratic contenders maintain that the country has vital interests, the asymmetrical attacks are coming to us in a much subtler way, as the deaths of the five MSF volunteers prove. </p> <p>Our enemies, while still doing daily battle for Falluja, keep conjuring up new ways to hurt us. Why not also blow up a gas line? Why not kill Turkish truck drivers? Why not destroy men lining up outside an Iraqi police station in the hope of recruitment? </p> <p>Above all, why not hit the \"soft\" parts of the international system? Why not bomb the UN headquarters in Baghdad and kill lots of outstanding people, including that remarkable ambassador for peace, Sergio Vieira de Mello? And, after you have committed such a terrible crime, why not, indeed, kill an MSF team? </p> <p>What could the next boundary of atrocity be? How far can this madness go? A nursing home in Chicago?</p> <p>There are no answers to such questions that, for me, carry any surety. And I am left, sadly, with John Donne's immortal poem about troubled times, the title of which is the headline of this humble piece. \"No man is an island, entire of itself,\" Donne wrote. All of us, not just in Asia and the Middle East, are going to feel the pressures described above. </p> <p>Not even the US can escape Donne's words these days.

  "<p>Muslim groups and individuals have flooded the British Council with complaints after learning that one of its senior press officers allegedly wrote controversial Sunday Telegraph articles attacking \"the black heart of Islam\". </p> <p>The government-funded body, which recently commissioned a handbook on Islam \"to prevent ignorant comments about Muslims being made in [the] national press\", has suspended Harry Cummins while it investigates the claims, which were first disclosed in the Guardian Diary. </p> <p>He denies writing the articles, which have prompted calls for the Press Complaints Commission to intervene. </p> <p>They appeared under the byline \"Will Cummins\", which the Sunday Telegraph later described as a pseudonym. </p> <p>Muslim organisations say the comment pieces incite racial and religious hatred, and the British Council describes the articles as deeply offensive. </p> <p>But the Sunday Telegraph has refused to rule out publishing further contributions from the author of the articles. Its editor, Dominic Lawson, told the Guardian that he did not regret printing them. </p> <p>The allegation is deeply embarrassing for the British Council, which works to improve relations between communities. </p> <p>Last year, Mr Cummins helped to promote a seminar \"to debate press freedom and responsibilities with emerging and potential Muslim leaders\". </p> <p>\"Will Cummins\" has compared Muslims to Nazis and argued that Muslim voters have a \"global jihadi agenda\". One of his articles states: \"All Muslims, like all dogs, share certain characteristics.\" Another argues: \"It is the black heart of Islam, not its black face, to which millions object.\" </p> <p>Other articles by the author have claimed that \"Muslim foreigners ... have forced themselves on us\", and that \"Christians are the original inhabitants and rightful owners of almost every Muslim land and behave with a humility quite unlike the menacing behaviour we have come to expect from the Muslims who have forced themselves on Christendom\". </p> <p>The author described voters in Leicester and Birmingham as \"local Janjaweed\" - in a reference to the atrocities committed in Darfur, Sudan - and claimed that Islam is \"sanctified by the principle ... that any civilisation, however repulsive, has the same value as any other\". </p> <p>The British Council's director general, David Green, has told the Muslim Council of Britain: \"There is no place in the British Council for people who publish such hateful utterances.\" </p> <p>Samar Mashadi, executive director of the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism, said: \"These pieces incite religious and racial hatred and anyone without a solid understanding of the contribution Muslims make to this country might take them at face value.\" </p> <p>Inayat Bunglawala, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, added that the sack was the only appropriate course for the British Council if Harry Cummins was the author. He added: \"The fact the Sunday Telegraph ran not just one, but four consecutive articles - a sustained barrage of not just insults but, we believe, of actual incitement - beggars belief.\" </p> <p>Two sources have told the Guardian that the articles were by Harry Cummins. Repeated attempts by reporters to contact him have failed, but the British Council says he has denied writing them. </p> <p>Christopher Wade, the council's director of communications, said yesterday: \"We take the allegations very seriously and [our investigation] will be concluded as quickly as possible, but we have to act in accordance with our standard procedures.\" </p> <p>He has personally contacted as many as possible of the hundred or so complainants. </p> <p>\"The British Council disassociates itself completely from the sentiments expressed in the articles written by Will Cummins,\" Mr Wade said. </p> <p>\"All of us are shocked and distressed that this should have happened. The articles ... are the antithesis of everything that we stand for and have worked to achieve over 70 years. We are determined to get to the bottom of this matter.\" </p> <p>Mr Wade pointed out that the council had worked hard to forge links with the Muslim community at home and overseas through a series of initiatives. </p> <p>Con Coughlin, the Sunday Telegraph's executive editor, told the Guardian in an emailed statement: \"We have no idea whether or not we will use him [Will Cummins] in future.\" </p> <p>He added: \"[The author] was given a pseudonym because he requested it. This is not unusual.\" </p> <p>He said that it was \"not necessary\" to explain why the newspaper had published the articles, and whether the paper would publish comment pieces which referred to another racial, ethnic or religious group in such terms.</p>",
  "The cold war was a time of hot diplomacy. Because in Europe the great contest of the second half of the last century was deadlocked on the battlefield, it was fought largely at superpower summit meetings and lower-level arms control talks. The subject matter was technical and, barring an occasional breakthrough, progress was slow. But the issues were huge, and for that reason politicians and the press followed the negotiations closely. <p>Now the stage is reversed. A plethora of hot wars over the last decade has turned people cold on diplomacy. The Churchillian adage that jaw-jaw is better than war-war is forgotten in favour of the faulty notion that applying superior military power is the best way to handle stubborn political conflicts. </p> <p>One reason is television, which increasingly sets the agenda for newspapers as well as governments. If there is no image there is no message, so political negotiations are condemned as inherently dull, if not irrelevant, compared to the visual drama of war. The other is the cult of impatience, caused by the new craze for humanitarian intervention and the excessive injection of morality into international disputes. If a conflict is projected as a struggle against evil-doers, then there is not a moment to lose. Delay itself becomes a form of moral appeasement and wickedness. When military action is crowned with rapid results and the bad guys' defeat, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, the illusion is created that a solution has been reached. </p> <p>The current media-driven push for military intervention in Sudan's western province of Darfur has all the hallmarks of the run-up to the west's last three wars. The fact that none has yet produced stability or justice is overlooked. </p> <p>The narrative in Darfur, which has been told repeatedly in recent weeks, is not new. Douglas Johnson's authoritative study, The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars, describes how war has been going on in Darfur at a low level among different groups of herdsmen and farmers for two decades. Successive Arab-led governments in Khartoum took sides, using Janjaweed militias, designated in 1989 as popular defence forces, who targeted villagers, killed and displaced civilians, and burned crops while the divide between \"Arabs\" and \"Blacks\" was deliberately sharpened. </p> <p>What has changed is the emergence of two ambitious rebel movements with political agendas, their decision to launch surprise attacks on government garrisons, and Khartoum's over-reaction with the use of air power and helicopter gunships. The government also gave a green light to the Janjaweed for widespread raids on villages that support the rebels. </p> <p>In spite of this disastrous escalation, a peace process has begun. Not many conflicts of this intensity have a channel for negotiations as well as international observers to try to keep them on track. Getting talks started while fighting is under way is usually a major hurdle. </p> <p>In having a peace track Darfur is lucky, though one would not know it from most media commentaries, with their impatience for sanctions or military action. Virtually every report of last week's UN security council resolution, which gave Sudan 30 days to show progress in disarming the Janjaweed, avoided mention of a paragraph which made demands on the rebels too. It criticised their leaders' boycott of the latest peace talks. It urged them to stop their ceasefire violations and drop all preconditions for attending the next round of talks under African Union sponsorship. </p> <p>Darfur is also lucky in that the gap between the parties is not as wide as in many conflicts. Neither rebel movement is calling for independence. This is not Kosovo or Chechnya. A model for the autonomy they want for their western region exists in the deal reached this year between Khartoum and the southern rebels. To expand that agreement to take in Darfur or forge one on the southern formula of decentralisation and wealth-sharing ought not to be too hard. </p> <p>Diplomats and experts on Sudan say the rebel movements are not clear who to designate as leaders, or how representative the current spokespeople are. Some hesitate to attend talks for fear of being exposed or denounced. Another problem is that the rebels may think they can get their way, in the present climate of anti-Khartoum moralising, without compromise or long-term thinking. </p> <p>In any hostile intervention a key test is regional backing. On Kosovo, though there was no UN mandate for war, European governments took the initiative for military action. There was no comparable backing for the US-led wars on Afghanistan and Iraq from most of those countries' neighbours. Similarly in Darfur, the African Union has no interest in military interference against Khartoum's wishes, especially now that the government has agreed to an African ceasefire monitoring force. </p> <p>So, instead of talk of western military intervention, pressure needs to be put on the rebels to pick genuine representatives and get to the negotiating table. The Sudanese government is also divided - between hardliners who hope for military victory if the talks fail and those willing to listen to the African Union. Khartoum bears primary responsibility for the excessive use of force. But division among the rebels is the major obstacle to restoring the peace process. </p> <p>Like Sudan until the Darfur eruption, Sri Lanka was one of the world's few good-news stories of 2002-03. There too, after a long civil war between the Singhalese majority and Tamil Tiger rebels, international mediation produced a ceasefire and peace talks. </p> <p>Now they are under threat. The culprits are not western television or impatient humanitarian interventionists. A small island with no oil or strategic value, Sri Lanka was largely ignored in war and peace. Even a death toll of 64,000 over 18 years made little impact abroad. Its problems are internal. On the Singhalese side the peace talks, mediated by Norway, were treated as a political football. President Chandrika Kumaratunga claimed the government had made too many concessions, and got her party back in power by appealing to nationalists. </p> <p>On the Tigers' side, a split between the northern and eastern leaderships has become a campaign of assassinations, which has raised anxieties about their willingness to accept democracy. Meanwhile, the army made links with the eastern rebels. The Tigers' northern leaders accuse it of not backing a return to peace talks which have been suspended for 18 months. </p> <p>In strong terms for mediators, the Norwegians denounce both sides' \"incredible complacency\". \"What we're seeing now is a frozen war that is starting to melt at the edges\", as their envoy Vidar Helgesen puts it. The island's slip back to war shows how difficult it is - even with no Darfur-style foreign clamour - to get a political settlement without calm and effective leadership, preparation of public opinion and transparency. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jonathan Steele, the Guardian's senior foreign correspondent, will be talking on Iraq at an open forum at the American Sociological Association's annual conference at the Hilton Hotel, San Francisco, on Saturday August 14 at 2.15pm</p>",

However, the leader of Tower Hamlets borough council, Helal Uddin Abbas, has strongly denied Ms Samad was victimised.</p> <p>\"I think it is a collective problem\", says Ms Samad, who is a second-generation Bengali. \"The community is quite traditional. I would put them [the male Bengali councillors] in my father's generation, while I am second generation. </p> <p>\"I had expected there to be generational issues, but I did not expect it towards someone like me - a graduate and professional, and pretty clued-up.

A Leeds university graduate and former regeneration manager, Ms Samad joined the Labour party in 2000 after becoming concerned that community funds for regeneration projects were being wasted. </p> <p>Although she quit her job last year to concentrate on politics, she says that the constant harassment wore her down and the realisation that she could not effect change in the current environment kept her away from meetings. Just over two years later, she describes herself as \"exhausted and disillusioned\".</p> <p>\"My attendance - due to the stuff they were throwing at me at the time - was appalling. You get to the point where you do not see the point of turning up to the meetings to pay lip service.\"</p> <p>The London borough of Tower Hamlets is a community with a large Bengali population. This cultural profile is healthily reflected in the council's 51 elected members. But like councils and party groups up and down the country, the 34-strong Labour group has a very small number of female members within its ranks - five, out of the council's total complement of nine women councillors. Now Ms Samad has quit, Labour is down to four. </p> <p>The Labour government has so far failed to mobilise the participation of women in local politics. Nationally, the number of women councillors remains stubbornly unrepresentative (29%), whereas the number of councillors from black ethnic minority communities has actually dropped under Labour, to 2.5%. </p> <p>From the start, the segregated nature of the Tower Hamlets Labour group was evident to Ms Samad. She describes being told on her arrival by a white councillor that she would have to team up with the Bengali group. \"We had nothing in common apart from the colour of our skin\", she says. </p> <p>\"If they [the male Bengali councillors] had their way, they would still want to see the segregation of women. I do not want to point the finger just at them, because I think it is the whole set-up which allows people to get away with these things. </p> <p>\"If Labour says it is about transparent government, I do not understand why my white colleagues felt they had to go into their own little groups and the Bengalis had to go to the other side of the room,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The Labour party pays lip service to women and in particular to black minority ethnic women because it is a new area for some of them. I do not want to be pampered or mollycoddled. I just want an equal playing field.\"</p> <p>But Mr Abbas, Tower Hamlets borough council leader, insisted that Ms Samad's reasons for standing down were because the party whip was withdrawn from her over both her \"abysmal\" attendance and performance. </p> <p>\"[Her allegations] are totally unfounded and total nonsense\", he said. \"She failed. She resigned on the basis of being unable to hold on to the responsibilities expected of new councillors. What she is now trying to do is scapegoat and try to blame her own councillors on the grounds of being victimised.\"</p> <p>Mr Abbas said that Ms Samad's claims of harassment were explored by the council. The accused members were interviewed, but despite repeated approaches to Ms Samad, it was she herself who failed to participate in the investigation.</p> <p>\"I took her complaint very seriously\", he said. \"She was asked to come forward but she never followed it up.\"</p> <p>Asked if the party gave new members sufficient support, Mr Abbas said: \"Ms Samad received support from both male and female councillors. Women members have offered her support, and she failed to take up their offers on each occasion.\"</p> <p>Political factions are not a new phenomenon, and would hardly make Tower Hamlets unique. But Mr Abbas also denied that the Labour group was divided along racial lines. \"I would welcome you to attend a council meeting, and I would like you to [try to] see where this 'segregation' takes place.\"</p> <p>Ashok Viswanathan, of Operation Blackvote, admits there is some way to go before political parties become inclusive and cohesive: \"People need to be consensual in the way they conduct their business in a council chamber. </p> <p>\"If you have committees on any issue, you must ensure that you do not pigeonhole people and you also ensure that all the business is inclusive to all members of the council. </p> <p>\"Nobody should feel that they have a duty or a burden in representing a particular issue. That is one of the problems when these things are carved up the way they are. You continue to perpetuate the sort of adversarial, cliquey, smoke-filled corridor political process that has given politics, in the eyes of the public, a bad name.\"</p> <p>Ms Samad is now concentrating on rebuilding her career, though her foray into politics may not be over. \"I am talking to the Respect coalition and asking what their plans are,\" she said. </p> <p>Would she stand on the Respect ticket? \"Not at this stage, but in the future. I would like to be instrumental in encouraging more women in the community to go forward in the next election.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday August 9 2004</strong></p> <p>In the article below, we said the industry regulator had \"nearly halved\" the water companies' proposed bills. In fact, he more than halved them by cutting the proposed increases of \u00a370 to \u00a333.</p> <p><strong>&lt;HR size=\"1\"</strong></p> <p>Millions of consumers in England and Wales face hefty increases in their water and sewerage bills next year to help pay for almost \u00a316bn worth of upgrades to ageing pipes, and to improve environmental standards. </p> <p>But Philip Fletcher, the industry regulator, yesterday nearly halved the real-term increases in bills proposed by the privatised water companies for the next five years. </p> <p>He cut their planned rise from an average of \u00a370, or 29% (before inflation), to an average of \u00a333, or 13%. </p> <p>The average bill, now \u00a3249 a year, will rise to \u00a3282 under his proposals, rather than the \u00a3319 sought by the companies. </p> <p>He said bills would be only 3% higher in real terms in 2009 than they were a decade earlier because of reductions of more than 12% imposed by his predecessor in 2000. </p> <p>The highest bills will be in the south-west of England, where consumers will pay an average of \u00a3418 a year. Customers of three smaller water-only companies will see their bills cut by up to 6%. </p> <p>Mr Fletcher left a sting in the tail, however, by allowing companies to increase annual bills by an average of 7.6% or \u00a317 from April next year - just before the likely date for the general election. The companies had wanted a \u00a337 rise. </p> <p>Mr Fletcher, the director general of water services at Ofwat, rejected suggestions that he had drastically scaled back the companies' plans because of political pressures. </p> <p>He said his initial proposals were fair to business, customers and the environment. </p> <p>\"Ministers have been absolutely scrupulous in recognising the regulator's independence, and there's been no improper pressure at any point in the system,\" he said. </p> <p>Ofwat will set the final price limits in December, with ministers due to issue their own final guidance on what they want next month. Mr Fletcher indicated that companies would have to come up with \"powerful arguments\" to make him change his mind. </p> <p>Margaret Beckett, the environment secretary, has resisted pressure from cabinet colleagues to contain price rises by cutting back environmental programmes, and she may urge Ofwat to reinstate discarded schemes. </p> <p>The environment agency, which is close to Ms Beckett's department, said it wanted a better deal for the environment than allowed for in Mr Fletcher's draft proposals, which set aside a \"modest\" \u00a33.2bn out of \u00a315.7bn of capital spending on improvements over five years. </p> <p>Ofwat cut \u00a35bn off the companies' proposed capital investment - including \u00a31.3bn from plans to spend \u00a39.4bn upgrading Victorian pipes and sewers; \u00a31.2bn from measures to stop leaks and make new connections; and around \u00a3500m from plans to stop sewers flooding. </p> <p>The consumer group WaterVoice, which had warned of a customer backlash to the companies' plans, welcomed the Ofwat proposals but voiced concerns over issues such as sewer flooding. </p> <p>Mr Fletcher said Ofwat had rejected ill thought-out and expensive schemes, including plans to spend \u00a3120,000 a home on preventing sewer flooding. He said 8,200 more homes would be safeguarded, leaving only 0.02% at risk of flooding by 2010. </p> <p>He also expressed scepticism about plans for a 20-mile \"mini-Channel tunnel\" to prevent the kind of sewage overflows that killed thousands of fish in the Thames this week. A scheme costing up to \u00a33bn is yet to be approved. </p> <p>Consumer groups and organisations representing the poor and pensioners voiced concern that the price rises would prove unaffordable or substantially increase debt. </p> <p>Wildlife groups welcomed the proposals, with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds saying threats to animals such as birds, otters and voles through pollution and drainage would be significantly reduced. </p> <p><strong>Water costs to 2010</strong><br> Offwat's figures on the likely changes to bills from the water and sewage companies in the next five years.

  "Anti-terrorist officials on both sides of the Atlantic last night claimed that one of the 12 terror suspects being questioned at a London police station was one of al-Qaida's most significant operatives. <p>They are convinced that Abu Musa al-Hindi, being held at Paddington Green high-security police station, had a decision-making role in the highest echelons of the global network. </p> <p>\"He's believed to be a leading member of an organisation which would like to inflict serious damage on the west,\" said a British anti-terrorism source. </p> <p>Mr Hindi - thought to have several aliases including Bilal - was among four men held in Willesden in north-west London on Tuesday in a concerted anti-terror and MI5 operation. </p> <p>Scotland Yard said it was reviewing its plans to deploy additional officers to guard key public buildings and high-profile people after Mr Hindi's arrest. </p> <p>A British source with knowledge of the investigation said: \"We can never be complacent, but with this arrest the feeling is that the threat will recede in the coming days. </p> <p>\"There will be peaks and troughs, but this arrest is significant and the feeling is that this particular crisis is easing.\" Fred Burton, a former US state department anti-terrorist official, said: \"He appears to be part of the management cell. All of our counter-terror sources are telling us that he is the big catch.\" </p> <p>Last night the solicitor for seven of the 12 in custody complained about police tactics. Muddassar Arani said that one of her clients seized in a barber's shop in London had been dragged across the floor and struck in the mouth by police despite not resisting arrest. \"He has a visible injury to his mouth and bruising around the ear,\" she said. </p> <p>Ms Arani said her clients did not know the specific charges against them more than 48 hours after their arrests. They had been interviewed twice for a total of 10 minutes and no allegations had been put to them. \"They were shaken up at first, police had used excessive force. Now they are more relaxed.\" </p> <p>Yesterday police obtained an extension, which allows them to question them until Sunday, and they can then apply for further extensions for a total of 14 days from the time of arrest. </p> <p>Scotland Yard last night refused to comment on reports that five people they had wanted to arrest during the raids evaded capture and were on the run. </p> <p>According to unconfirmed reports from Pakistan, the British arrests were prompted by information gleaned from Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, a 25-year-old computer expert arrested in Lahore three weeks ago, and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, also arrested there two weeks ago. </p> <p>Mr Ghailani is thought to have masterminded the devastating attacks on American embassies in east Africa in 1998 and his arrest was seen as a major coup. But officials now believe Mr Hindi is a much more valuable catch. </p> <p>Pakistani officials said computer disks belonging to Mr Khan and Mr Ghailani contained detailed photographs and plans of Heathrow airport and underpasses in central London, as well as communications with key al-Qaida operatives in the UK. </p> <p>The officials said emails found on Mr Khan's computer showed he was in regular contact with al-Qaida activists in Britain, believed to include Mr Hindi. </p> <p>Intelligence officers and government officials in Pakistan were yesterday claiming responsibility for providing the information which triggered the arrests. \"We got the information on the people who were arrested in Britain from the computer of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan,\" said an intelligence official quoted by the Reuters news agency. \"We got some names and there were also emails he had sent.\" </p> <p>Mr Khan visited the UK several times in the last few years. He studied briefly at London's City University and is also thought to have met Abu Hamza, the radical cleric wanted by the US on terrorist charges. </p> <p>British security sources strenuously denied claims of an advanced plot to bomb Heathrow or another high-profile target in London. </p> <p>Officials insisted that the material found in Pakistan was at least three years old and did not constitute a reason for raising the security threat level in Britain. </p> <p>Despite the prominence which the British and US authorities are attaching to Mr Hindi, very little is known about him, beyond the fact that he was born in Pakistan and is thought to have lived in Britain for several years. </p> <p>In contrast to the British reticence to disclose information surrounding the arrests, the American authorities have been very public about their efforts to capture Mr Ghailani. </p> <p>In May, the US attorney general, John Ashcroft, included Mr Ghailani on a list of seven al-Qaida operatives who were planning an attack in the US this summer or autumn. </p> <p>The most prominent person on that list was Adnan Shukrijumah, a Saudi who could take charge of the next set of al-Qaida terror attacks in the US. </p>",
  "<p>Peter Maxwell Davies's Antarctic Symphony has a lot to live up to. Not only does it attempt to transform the elemental power of the frozen continent into sound, it is designed as a self-sufficient musical argument, a piece to stand beside Davies's seven other symphonies. In his Prom with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, Davies himself conducted the 40-minute work and created a journey of geological momentum and symphonic drama. </p> <p>Unlike Vaughan Williams, whose Sinfonia Antarctica was based on Scott's attempt on the south pole, Davies's work was inspired by his own trip to Antarctica. The piece opened with sounds of splintering energy, snaps of brass and woodwind and cracking shards of percussion - a dramatic prelude to the whole work. </p> <p>Davies conjured the polar landscape with textures at the extremes of orchestral possibility. His ethereal string lines, rumbling bass drums and double-basses sounded like the reverberations of distant icebergs crumbling into the sea. The piece created a sense of different time-scales happening simultaneously. Fast, unpredictable music was superimposed over frozen strata of string sound and woodwind chords. It was as if the music had become a glacier in which fragments of musical rubble were suspended. At the end, material from the symphony was compressed into a crashing climax before the hollow sounds of the final bars - a vision of desolation and a post-global warming Antarctica, after the ice has melted. </p> <p>Yan Pascal Tortelier followed with a performance of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, the ancestor of every descriptive symphony. In an interpretation of fastidious attention to detail and tumultuous passion, Tortelier made Berlioz's orchestration sound as daring as anything in Davies's piece, such as the chilling passage for four timpani players and solo cor anglais at the end of the slow movement. He conducted the final Dream of a Sabbath Night with diabolical energy, as the BBCPO players extinguished Berlioz's hero with gleeful, mocking intensity.</p>",

  "<p>The aspirations to address some of the failings of city-making are commendable (Riba goes to town, July 31), but to start from the sterile strategy of \"new urbanism\" risks repeating past mistakes by importing inappropriate theories. Let 's hope that the artificiality of new urbanism is quickly rejected as it was in The Truman Show. </p> <p>We should start by recognising we are just another layer between past and future; we build upon the past and set the framework for the future, with the solution never being the complete answer. Healthy cities are dynamic and increasingly characterised by their ability to respond rapidly to changing circumstance. The last thing a healthy environment wants is to be frozen in the artificiality of new urbanism, like many town centres are now locked into ideas of the 1960s. </p> <p>Cities that endure have largely come about by having to overcome particular issues such as defence, high water levels, economic change or new infrastructure. Our strategies should not be limited to the physical environment, but engage the diverse economic, social and political dimensions of places. City-making no longer lies at the feet of the heroic architect, but becomes the responsibility of a range of people, both professional and non-professional. </p> <p>However, the call for an institute of urbanism fails to acknowledge the process already underway at places such as the cities programme at the LSE. This programme is rebalancing the decision-making process by mixing economists, sociologists, engineers and architects as a model of negotiated urbanism. Before we head off to build more quasi-Barcelonas, Berlins or Venices, perhaps we should reflect and build upon the unique and diverse characteristics and people that already exist in our cities.<br> <strong>Malcolm Smith</strong><br> Practice principal, Arup Associates </p>",
  "Ministers will keep their hands off lottery cash after the government backed down from ordering how money raised by the national lottery for good causes is spent. <p>The fresh approach to lottery cash came in an announcement by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, about how the Big Lottery Fund will work. </p> <p>The new body will distribute up to \u00a3700m a year, half of all the good causes money. </p> <p>Sir Clive Booth, who chairs the BLF, said the days of the government ordering lottery cash to pay for schemes such as fruit for school children were gone. </p> <p>The BLF is the result of an administrative merger of the Community Fund, set up to provide grants to charities, and the New Opportunities Fund, which has funded schemes in line with the three government priorities of health, education and the environment. </p> <p>The government has often prescribed schemes which the NOF must fund, including buying MRI scanners for NHS hospitals. </p> <p>Critics have attacked the use of lottery cash to fund government departments' \"pet whims\" or to make up for public spending cuts. </p> <p>Ms Jowell said yesterday that the government was making \"significant changes\" after consultations. </p> <p>\"We propose instead greatly to reduce the level of prescription,\" the minister said.</p>",
  "The monsoon flood which hit London and parts of southern England on Tuesday, causing sewers to overflow and thousands of dead fish to float down the Thames, was a salutary reminder of the effects of worldwide climate change in years to come. Nor was it the best time to learn that the government is scrapping a \u00a32bn scheme to save the Thames from returning to the Great Stink of the early Victorian age. The water companies, complaining yesterday that the Ofwat regulator has only allowed average price increases of 13% over the next five years (half of what they asked for) will need to be watched carefully to ensure that they invest enough in flood prevention and the renovation of obsolete sewage networks. We as citizens have an equally important role in promoting more economical water use and curbing pollution. <p>Most of us accept in theory, according to a recent ICM poll for the BBC, that human activity is responsible for changing the world's climate. Yet although nearly everyone (85%) professes willingness to make changes to help the environment, far fewer (54%) believe it will make any difference. With such scepticism, it is open to doubt just how many of those who say they will \"use the car less\" or \"take fewer flights\" will do so. Commenting on the poll, Friends of the Earth warns we are \"sleep-walking to disaster\". </p> <p>The problem is that the real disasters, from floods in south Asia to melting glaciers in the Andes, are happening a long way off and usually get only modest coverage. The latest toll for the recent Bangladesh floods is 10 million homeless, 660 people dead, and more than $6bn losses to the country's agriculture, industry and infrastructure. The shrinkage of glaciers reported this week from Peru, although it only affects a handful of people - mostly climbers and tourists - should be just as alarming. According to Peru's national environmental council, the country has lost 20% of its glaciers in the last 30 years. Similar reports are coming in from Alaska, where Nasa says glaciers are melting at a speed which increases the chance of future earthquakes. </p> <p>The government's chief scientist, Sir David King, has warned that London will be one of \"the first cities to go\" if the planet's ice continues to melt, and in April Tony Blair himself described the threat of climate change as the world's biggest problem. Yet public scepticism will only be dissolved by a real shift in priorities. As Sir David has also said, global warming is a greater challenge than global terrorism; until that message gets taken in, environmental anguish will be reserved for rainy days.</p>",
  "<p>Water and sewerage bills for the next five years will not raise enough to pay for many of the pressing improvements needed in the systems, and will leave Britain open to prosecution by the EU for failing to comply with its own environmental legislation. </p> <p>The regulator Ofwat, which has been wrestling with the competing demands of improvement and keeping the bills down, is partly the victim of its own success in reducing charges five years ago </p> <p>It argued that the companies had been so efficient that bills did not need to rise and there was enough surplus to do the work required. </p> <p>New EU environmental directives since then have made additional work necessary, while the increasing population in the south and the accelerating collapse of the Victorian systems requires a vast number of new pipes. </p> <p>One of the pressing needs is to cope with the more intense rainfall brought by climate change and the additional burden on existing sewers from new housing - graphically illustrated by the overflow into the Thames on Tuesday night which killed tens of thousands of fish. </p> <p>Preventing sewage overflows into the Thames is one of the many programmes shelved. About 30% of all the floods in Britain are caused by sewers that cannot cope. It used to be thought that because sewage was mixed with rainwater and therefore diluted storm overflows could be safely run into rivers. </p> <p>But research shows that the rush of water causes a big discharge of solids which are both disgusting and destructive of wildlife. There is a similar problem where storm sewage is discharged into coastal bathing waters. </p> <p>Schemes to help this problem in the north-west have also been shelved. </p> <p>The EU urban waste water directive which came into force in 2000 requires members to solve these problems. Britain is clearly not going to succeed and it is only a matter of time before it is taken before the European court. </p> <p>The Environment Agency and English Nature expressed doubt that the \u00a33.2bn capital intended for environmental quality, out of a total five-year programme of \u00a315.7bn, will meet the UK's legal obligations.</p>",
  "<p>Since writing about adopted Chinese girls in this column last year, I have become a builder. I am building a mothers' bridge for adoptive parents all over the world, after receiving hundreds of emails and letters from people who have adopted Chinese orphans, more than 99% of whom are girls. </p> <p>I also got a response from educated, middle-class women in China (few ordinary Chinese women have access to British newspapers). They found it hard to understand how western people could be so open-minded. In China, we never question other people's family set-ups, we only observe. We definitely do not discuss divorce and adoption; these are very private matters. </p> <p>So my Chinese friends are shocked. Why would they let everybody know their children are adopted, they ask? How can they admit to everyone that they can't have children of their own? I thought westerners cared more about privacy than we did? What will happen when these girls grow up and go to China? </p> <p>I was saddened by this mutual misunderstanding. How could these girls' Chinese birth mothers fully understand that their babies were loved and cared for by western adoptive families? How would an adoptive mother react if her daughter were to someday meet her Chinese birth mother? Would these mothers be proud of their western adopted daughters, if the girls came back to see them? </p> <p>In fact, many western adoptive families struggle with these cultural differences, too. I have a British friend who adopted a Chinese daughter (she also has two biological sons). She tried as far as she could to give her daughter a Chinese upbringing: a \"Chinese\" bedroom, painted a Chinese red with paper cuttings of Chinese characters on the wall (one of them meant for a wedding), and Chinese toys, most of them really for adults (binding shoes, a back-scratcher, a teapot, a traditional round fan, Qi dress or cheong-sam, a statue of Buddha, a foot massage bench, even an old lady's hat). Once, the five-year-old said to me, \"I don't want to be Chinese because I get different toys from my friends.\" </p> <p>Some families have asked where they can find \"typical\" Chinese products and clothes for their adopted daughters. But what do they mean by \"typical\"? I don't think it's something you can buy from the shops, not even in China. Children grow like plants - while the shape and form of the branch and its leaves may be very far from the roots, there is still a connection, through which they get support and nourishment. </p> <p>Psychologically, the most important thing for adopted Chinese children is to allow them to move freely between the two cultures, so that they can develop and make their own choices. For adoptive parents, one way of feeling a greater connecttion with Chinese culture is by helping other poor children there. This is the purpose of the charity I am setting up, Mothers' Bridge (<a href=\"http://www.motherbridge.org),\">www.motherbridge.org),</a> which aims to support adoptive parents and children. In spite of our different feelings about privacy and family, I believe we all, in China and the west, have a capacity for love. I also want to be able to help adopted children find an answer to that question, Why didn't my Chinese mother want me? </p> <p>I'll end with this poem by an anonymous author, sent to me by an adoptive mother: </p> <p>Once there were two women who never knew each other. </p> <p>One you do not remember, the other you call Mother. </p> <p>Two different lives shaped to make you one. </p> <p>One became your guiding star; the other became your sun. </p> <p>The first one gave you life, and the second taught you to live it. </p> <p>The first gave you a need for love. The second was there to give it. </p> <p>One gave you a nationality. The other gave you a name. </p> <p>One gave you a talent. The other gave you aim. </p> <p>One gave you emotions. The other calmed your fears. </p> <p>One saw your first sweet smile. The other dried your tears. </p> <p>One sought for you a home that she could not provide. </p> <p>The other prayed for a child and her hope was not denied. </p> <p>And now you ask me, through your tears, </p> <p>The age-old question unanswered through the years. </p> <p>Heredity or environment, which are you a product of? </p> <p>Neither, my darling. Neither. Just two different kinds of Love. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Xinran's most recent novel, Sky Burial, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus, at \u00a314.99.

  "<p>Matt Barrett, the outgoing chief executive of Barclays, yesterday scotched suggestions that the Competition Commission was ready to allow Abbey National to be taken over by a big domestic rival. </p> <p>Mr Barrett, who becomes chairman of Barclays next month, said the commission was \"quite strict\" about consolidation. </p> <p>While careful not be specific about Abbey, he said: \"The signal given before [by the competition authorities] against further consolidation by the big four seems to be prevailing.\" </p> <p>Since Lloyds TSB was blocked from buying Abbey three years ago, the former building society has been regarded as bid-proof by one of the big four: Lloyds, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. </p> <p>HBOS has admitted it is considering a bid for Abbey, potentially scuppering the agreed takeover by Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain whose offer of one of its own shares and 31p in cash valued each Abbey share at 555p last night. Abbey's shares rose 10p to 585p on persistent speculation that a counterbidder will emerge. HBOS was formed just as the Lloyds TSB bid for Abbey was blocked and it has positioned itself as a competitor to the big four. </p> <p>Mr Barrett was speaking as Barclays reported record interim pre-tax profits of \u00a32.4bn, up 23%. John Varley becomes chief executive on September 1, when Mr Barrett takes the chair four months earlier than planned and in defiance of City corporate governance codes. </p> <p>In the face of speculation that Barclays might sell itself to a big US player such as Citigroup or Bank of America, Mr Varley said Barclays had the \"self confidence\" to remain independent. \"We see [mergers and acquisitions] as the servant of strategy, not the master of it,\" he said. \"We have never been, nor will we become, crassly opportunistic or speculative in our corporate development activity.\" </p> <p>He ruled out using Barclays shares to make acquisitions of American retail and commercial banking operations. \"At our current share price levels, we are buyers of our shares, not sellers.\" </p> <p>Barclays shares rose 11.25p to 481.25p yesterday. The bank is paying an 8.25p interim dividend, a larger than expected rise of 17%. </p> <p>Mr Varley set out an ambition to expand in the US and to increase the percentage of income Barclays makes outside Britain from 20%. </p> <p>The rise in profits was boosted by Barclays Global Investors, its fund management arm, where profits rose 73% and the private client operation reported a 52% rise in profits. A bigger than expected fall in its bad debt provision to \u00a3589m - down 10% - also boosted profits, as did a 37% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3599m at Barclays Capital, its rapidly expanding investment banking arm. </p> <p>Analysts expressed concern about a \u00a3524m rise in group costs to \u00a33.9bn - \u00a3142m of this was for performance-related bonuses, largely inside the investment bank. </p> <p>The high street business reported a 6% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.2bn. Barclays, which owns Woolwich, wants to boost its mortgage market share. It is abolishing sales targets for branch staff and introducing a bonus scheme based on customer satisfaction which has been adopted by its business banking operation. Business banking profits rose 11% to \u00a3629m. </p> <p>Profits at Barclaycard rose 11% to \u00a3428m despite Mr Barrett's comments to MPs last year that he did not stack up debts on his Barclaycard because it was too expensive. He admitted there had been \"bumps in the road\" during his five-year tenure.</p>",

  "In one of the most widely predicted moves in recent years, the Bank of England yesterday raised interest rates by 0.25% to 4.75%, the fifth increase since November last year. This will raise the cost of borrowing, including mortgages, but will benefit savers. Some pundits had been expecting an increase of 0.5%, but this would have gone against the bank's recent predilection for small increases. This softly, softly approach is likely to continue, especially in the light of what Charlie Bean - the bank's chief economist - observed last week. Mr Bean said the bank was not in the business of \"clobbering the consumer\", adding that \"there is no empirical evidence to suggest that a large increase in rates is more effective than two smaller increases\". <p>The important question now is how many more, if any, increases, big or small, we need in order to prevent inflation (currently 1.6%) going above the 2% Treasury target without clobbering the domestic recovery now well underway. It takes up to two years for changes in interest rates to work fully through to economic activity - so we have yet to feel the full effects of the five increases in the pipeline. Meanwhile, the world economy, the main engine of our export growth, is already showing signs of slowing down in key areas like the US and China - though the second-largest economy, Japan, after a decade of stagnation, is now expanding strongly. The eurozone continues to lag behind. </p> <p>At home, the situation is still that we need higher rates to curb the service sector, but lower rates to support manufacturing, especially as demand from the rest of the world slows down. Earlier this week the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply suggested that manufacturing was enjoying its fastest growth for a decade based on data relating to July. Yesterday, however, official figures indicated that manufacturing output fell by 0.7% between May and June and was only 1.6% above the level of a year ago. Even if it revives in the months ahead, it is unlikely to develop into a boom as world growth slackens, not least because companies are still battling against a strong exchange rate. </p> <p>From the government's vantage point, economic developments must now look pretty cheery. Unemployment and inflation are low, while the economy is expanding at a rate of 3.7% a year. Although that is above the rate that can be sustained without stoking up inflation, this will not worry the prime minister unduly. From now until the election, a strong economy will be generating extra tax revenues that will bolster the public finances and keep the feel-good factor well oiled. Thereafter, there is at least a 50-50 chance that the UK economy will simply switch into a lower gear in response to a global slowdown rather than slither into recession. The same goes for consumer spending. Retail sales are still on a roll, but ought to slow down as the housing boom starts to subside and as higher oil prices depress sentiment - and spending power - in the domestic economy. At long last there are also tentative signs of a revival of something you don't hear a lot about these days - the house building market. Orders for public and housing association homes rose by 24% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier - admittedly from a very low base. </p> <p>There ought still to be concerns about the trade deficit and the associated decline of manufacturing. But, sadly, not many people worry about such things these days. The biggest threats remain external - either from terrorist action that could ignite oil prices or from an implosion of the US economy that some have been predicting for years, but which has stubbornly refused to happen so far. Wherever you look, however, it is difficult to see a case for interest rates to continue rising much further.</p>",
  "Labour and the Tories are fighting over the law and order baton in the race for government. But both parties are committed to a regime that arguably causes more crime than any other single policy. In the 2004 comprehensive spending review last month, Gordon Brown earmarked just under \u00a315bn to run the Home Office in 2007-08, up more than \u00a34bn on 2002-03 but a billion less than the \u00a316bn that the government estimates to be the annual cost of drug-related crime. Could it be that some of this expenditure is actually creating this crime? Is there a policy elephant that has hidden itself where no one can see it? <p>Transform estimates that drug prohibition has cost between \u00a3100bn and \u00a3200bn over the past 20 years. The government estimates that it currently costs \u00a320bn a year. </p> <p>In 1961 the UK signed up to the UN convention on drugs, joining over 150 member states in pledging to criminalise the production, supply and use of a selection of psychoactive substances. This was the definitive moment when global drug prohibition came into being. Ten years later the then home secretary, Jim Callaghan, introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Then there were fewer than 5,000 problematic drug users in the UK. There are now an estimated 280,000, mostly using heroin and/or cocaine. </p> <p>Unfortunately the chancellor does not control the price of opium- or coca-based products. That is left to the unregulated illegal market. As a result of the risk attached to the trade, profit margins exceed that of any other commodity on the planet - 2000% to 3000% between production and use is not unheard of, a gift horse for organised criminals. The knock-on effect of the price hike at street level is to make a daily habit far too much for most people to afford. An average heroin habit starts at \u00a350 a day; a crack binge can run into hundreds. Problematic users on ordinary incomes often resort to crime to support their habit. </p> <p>There are 8 million heavy drinkers in the UK of whom 2 million are very heavy drinkers. The crime costs associated with the misuse of alcohol are \u00a37.3bn a year - most of it violent crime. There is little property crime associated with alcohol use and none committed by the UK's 12 million tobacco users. Our million prescription tranquilliser addicts are not begging on street corners or breaking into houses. A far smaller population of heroin and crack users commit far more crimes, purely because their daily habit is prohibitively expensive. </p> <p>As part of its welcome review of British sex laws the government estimated that 95% of street prostitution is related to crack and heroin use. Most of the women plying their trade by the road do so to get a rock of crack, and will repeat the cycle for 36 hours or so until they crash out, using heroin until the cycle begins again. </p> <p>Lest you think that legal regulation would be a panacea, imagine 12 million heroin addicts instead of tobacco users, a world where crack was aggressively marketed to young people using techniques perfected by the likes of British American Tobacco and alcopops retailers. Haven't we got enough legal drugs on the market to tempt our children? </p> <p>So, let's all pretend that young people are prey to evil pushers, rather than self-determining individuals who, like adults, make some lousy decisions. And if they screw up, let's make sure that, on top of everything else, they have the long arm of the law to deal with. </p> <p>Problematic use is clearly linked to social deprivation and only tackling its root causes will significantly reduce the numbers of new problem users. It is no coincidence that Britain has some of the highest levels of problematic use in Europe and one of the widest gaps between rich and poor. </p> <p>Prohibition is a major cause of theft, is responsible for violent turf wars, contributes to urban degeneration and makes criminals of millions of otherwise law-abiding people. </p> <p>The UK locks up more people than any other western European nation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that somewhere between 30% and 80% of the prison population are property offenders funding a heroin or crack habit. Prohibition also contributes significantly to the destabilisation of most of Latin America, Afghanistan and the Caribbean. </p> <p>So let's treat our way out of this mess: \u00a3573m is earmarked for treatment of our quarter of a million illegal drug users (compared with \u00a3100m for alcohol treatment). This treatment spending is delivered primarily through the criminal justice system: the Criminal Justice Intervention Programme is the newest flagship scheme to reduce offending among problematic users. </p> <p>The effect of prohibition is to force up the price of illegal drugs, causing problematic users to steal and be identified through the courts. They are then - and only then - provided with treatment programmes of highly variable quality. This means that most of our money is spent enforcing the law, the public bears the brunt of the crime costs and the policy appears to be \"tough on crime\". The government is effectively running a harm maximisation policy, implementing a crime reduction policy masquerading as treatment. </p> <p>The reaction to all this from journalists, parliamentarians, NGOs and academics is surprisingly muted. In 2002 the Observer polled a cross-section of adults on a range of drug policy issues: 45% believed that levels of street crime and burglary would be reduced if hard drugs were decriminalised.</p> <p>If nearly half the adult population understands that prohibition creates property crime, why don't policy makers, the press, criminologists and NGOs involved in crime reduction and penal reform? </p> <p>Prohibition will continue so long as its potential critics remain silent. And home secretaries of all political hues will continue to trumpet reductions in crime, while pursuing the policy that doubles it. Next time the crime figures are announced in the news, look carefully - there may be an elephant in the room. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Danny Kushlick is director of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk\">www.tdpf.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>On June 11 1994, the mayor of Amber Valley borough council in Derbyshire, councillor Ron Buzzard, and Bob Billington, president of Blackstone Valley Tourism Council in Rhode Island, USA, put their names to a document that expressed many lovely sentiments. As part of a twinning agreement, the two dignitaries committed themselves \"to maintain permanent ties between the communities within our administrative areas, to promote in all spheres interchanges between their inhabitants in order to develop by a better mutual understanding the living feeling of fraternity. To combine our efforts in order to contribute in full measure to the success of the necessary enterprise for friendship and prosperity. And under our respective seals we hereby twin.\" </p> <p>Fine words, no doubt, and indeed, in the past decade the living feeling of fraternity between these two transatlantically distant valleys has been developed in many ways (trade links, civic beanos, football matches, textile appreciation meetings, mutually edifying cuisine exchanges, etc). But what most people remember about the twinning of Amber Valley and Blackstone Valley is the horrible row involving the unwanted gift of a 7ft-tall fibreglass effigy of Mister Potato Head (of which more, later). </p> <p>Amber Valley came to the much-derided, town-twinning movement late. Amber Valley's civic dignitaries - if you believe what certain newspapers say - thus missed the opportunity to spend several decades wallowing at the ratepayers' expense in French cheeses, German beers, Belgian chocolates and, where possible, Spanish hooch. The first twinning agreement involving a British town came when Keighley in West Yorkshire set up links with Poix du Nord in France in 1920, but the real impetus for town twinning came after the second world war when the aim was to heal Europe's wounds, to nurture warm feelings, overcome stereotypes and aid economic regeneration. True, the movement had to overcome many obstacles, such as councillor Stuart Welham, deputy mayor of Morley. When the Yorkshire town held a dinner to celebrate the 35th anniversary of twinning links with the German town of Siegen in 2001, Welham interrupted a lengthy speech by a German guest to say: \"He's stalling for time while his mates invade Poland!\" </p> <p>By the time Amber Valley's dignitaries moseyed up to the twinning trough, you might be forgiven for thinking that all the best places had been nabbed. For instance, Birmingham - home of balti cuisine and the beau Brummie - is twinned with Lyons, France's gastronomic capital, as well as Milan, arguably Italy's most sartorially stylish city. It is also twinned with Frankfurt, but let's not spoil the story. Hull (adjudged Britain's crappest town in a recent book) is twinned with Reykjavik (Iceland's capital of cool). Dainty French lace-making town Alen\u00e7on is twinned with Hampshire's industrial hub, Basingstoke. Not since Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau became flatmates have there been such odd couples. </p> <p>Currently, there are more than 2,000 twinning links involving UK towns, cities and villages, half of which are with France and a quarter with Germany. There are no rules, however, about who can twin with whom. If West Bromwich sought to twin with Venice, say, on account of its extensive canal network and not inconsiderable contribution to the European renaissance, then so long as the Venetians gave the idea the thumbs up no official body could gainsay the pair's looming embrace. In fact, it might be a good idea: after all, according to the European Commission's recent Directorate-General for Education and Culture memo No 64/03: \"Twinning provides the opportunity to find out more about the daily lives of citizens in other European countries, to talk to them and exchange experiences, and to develop joint projects on issues of common interest, such as local integration, the environment, economic development, and cultural differences.\" But the Venetians don't have the benefit of West Bromwich's heady cultural attractions; Amritsar (India) and Le Blanc-Mesnil (France) are twinned to it instead. </p> <p>But let's go back to the early 1990s, when Amber Valley sought to break down the walls of British insularity and twin with some sunny place with free hors d'oeuvres. With whom would Amber Valley twin? In 1993, councillors and officials pondered this question and then plumped, unexpectedly, for a place just like their own, only in the USA. Why? \"It's all to do with Samuel Slater, who in the late 1700s emigrated to the States,\" says Peter Carney, Amber Valley council's chief executive. Slater, a textile worker from Richard Arkwright's mill in Belper (one of the many towns that makes Amber Valley what it is), crossed the Atlantic to make his fortune because he was convinced that England's textile industry was on the way out (what a prophetic chap he was). Slater built the US's first successful water-powered textile mill in the Rhode Island town of Pawtucket in 1793, and many more followed in the Blackstone Valley. The rest, as they say, is history. Not very interesting history, perhaps, but history none the less. </p> <p>This historical link made twinning with Blackstone Valley seem like a good idea. \"What we thought we could do was borrow Blackstone Valley's model of a national textile heritage centre and put it into practice along the River Derwent,\" says Carney. \"We also thought that the twinning link would encourage tourism from Blackstone Valley and, if we were lucky, a bit of inward investment.\" </p> <p>All of these things have happened in the past decade. There is a Derwent Valley Visitor Centre, which tells the story of Belper's mills. \"It's been a great success in promoting inward tourism. We've also had very good exchanges in sport and the arts,\" says Carney, who also points out that a Rhode Island company set up a manufacturing plant in Amber Valley, creating more than 30 jobs. </p> <p>These benefits give the lie to the notion that the twinning was devised to facilitate municipal jollies and the swelling of councillors' guts. And yet those images persist. In March, for instance, the Sunday Telegraph cited councillors using twinning links to visit a German beer festival, to take part in a rock'n'roll pilgrimage to Memphis and to fly in a hot-air balloon across a French valley. These jaunts, as shadow local government minister, Eric Pickles, has pointed out, come at a time when some councils have substantially increased tax bills. </p> <p>Alix Hughes, Bristol council's twinning officer, says this view is based on a misunderstanding about the point of twinning. \"In fact, coun cillors are worried about using twinning links for freebies because they're very aware, unless they're not bright, that it's a vote loser,\" he says. </p> <p>And twinning also often risks being a PR disaster. For instance, the most publicised aspect of Amber Valley's twinning programme with Blackstone Valley is not job creation or inward investment, but the aforementioned debacle over Mr Potato Head. Three years ago, the citizens of Blackstone Valley sent the people of Amber Valley a special fraternity gift to celebrate their twinning agreement. \"This is a most generous gesture from our friends in Rhode Island,\" said Amber Valley council's tourism development officer, Reg Whitworth, at the time. But from the moment the \u00a36,000 gift was unveiled before officials from both countries at Ripley Market Place in May 2001, things started to go wrong. </p> <p>The gift turned out to be a 7ft-tall fibreglass Mr Potato Head: like the the character immortalised in the Toy Story films, but dressed as early English settler William Blackstone in buckled shoes and a Quaker hat. The jauntily waving figure was supposed to be a goodwill ambassador, but the people of Belper, Ripley and other Amber Valley towns didn't care for it. A Spud-You-Don't-Like pressure group sprang up and, according to the Sun, Amber Valley residents were \"spuddy furious\". </p> <p>\"We thought it was a nice gesture,\" said Billington. \"This is where the little guy was invented.\" (Pawtucket is the headquarters of Hasbro Inc, Mr Potato Head's manufacturer.) But because nobody wanted him, the effigy was moved all over Amber Valley. He was sent from Ripley to Belper, and then plonked outside a school in Heanor, where some children tore off one arm and broke his hat. \"His eyelashes were attached with tape, which weren't very secure, and they have been washed off as he has stood outside,\" recalls Reg Whitworth. Following surgery by a fibreglass specialist, the gift was placed outside Safeway's supermarket in Belper, but not for long. Mr Potato Head soon disappeared from Amber Valley altogether. </p> <p>The incident left hurt feelings all round. \"Surely, they could have sent us something better,\" one Belper protester told the local newspaper, while officials in Blackstone Valley said there was much disappointment in Rhode Island. \"It's upset a few folks out here,\" said Billington. \"We felt that he would be well received.\" \"Our relationship is still very warm,\" says Carney, \"and it's been very beneficial to us. Twinning can be a very important thing.\" </p> <p>Amber Valley has also twinned with the funky-sounding Polish town of Glogow, a copper-ore manufacturing centre that was 95% destroyed during a siege in the second world war, and has since been rebuilt. Links with Glogow started in 1994, as part of the European Union's Overture Programme to support countries emerging from the former eastern bloc. What was in the link for Amber Valley? \"Well,\" says Peter Carney, \"the success of that programme enabled the Amber Valley to obtain EU funding to support training for local businesses.\" The resulting Adapt project attracted to Amber Valley \u00a3359,000-worth of Euro-funding during the mid-90s, which would not otherwise have been available. </p> <p>But there was more. Cultural links have cemented Amber Valley and Glogow's intracontinental relationship. Amber Valley textile artists teamed up with artists in Glogow to create a \u00a328,000 banner celebrating the history of the old Polish town. And Amber Valley musicians have taken part in the Annual Glogow Festival of Culture. Amber Valley Band member, Andy Martin, recalls this May's festival: \"We had an amazing jamming session with all the bands together: music really crossing language barriers. The young people of Glogow were very enthusiastic about the mix of British folk/rock that we play. They were dancing to everything.\" </p> <p>Where next? The council is currently contemplating twinning with Laholm in Sweden and Shaoxing in China for reasons chiefly to do with promoting local business. \"We're mostly concerned to have some economically beneficial spin offs from these links and these towns could provide them,\" says Carney. It's good that they've not been put off twinning by the whole Mr Potato Head debacle. \"Yes, it is, isn't it?\" What happened to him, by the way? \"He's found a good home,\" says Carney. \"Today he can be found in an All-American Theme Park near Ilkeston. We've moved on since then. This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of twinning with Blackstone Valley and all the many mutually beneficial links it's promoted.\" As part of the anniversary celebrations Belper Town football club is going to Rhode Island in September as goodwill ambassadors from Amber Valley. Let's hope the Americans don't decide to dismember them and stick them in a theme park.</p>",
  "<p>As I pass through Newcastle airport on the way to the Team GB Olympic camp in Cyprus, I find myself engaged with Geordie holidaymakers in addressing two popular questions. Will Sunderland get promoted, and how are we going to do in Athens? </p> <p>The first I answer in the usual way, which is in the affirmative but based on no credible recent evidence or scientific research, merely the blind faith of the football fan. The second answer, however, is given with more confidence despite the fact that trying to predict any sporting outcome is much more complicated and unreliable than many of us like to think. This is why bookmakers make so much money out of sport, because we are wrong more often than right. But as far as the Olympics go, help is at hand. </p> <p>Medal-mapping, as it is called, has become something of a science, and in case you think it all a waste of time - think again. Millions of pounds of lottery funding are now poured into four-year programmes based on the medal outcomes at the end of them. The British swimmers in Sydney missed out badly on their medal targets and so found themselves with reduced funding this time round. Under Bill Sweetenham they now have a squad ready to win some medals, but you won't find him putting a number on it. They have learned their lesson. </p> <p>After the success of the rest of the team in Sydney, other sports were left in a difficult position as far as medal predictions were concerned. It was hardly sensible to put forward a four-year plan for Athens that might suggest fewer medals than in the 2000 games. That would be unlikely to go down well with the funding organisations UK Sport and Sport England. So most sports ended up being rather bullish about their prospects, partly in order to be seen to continue to move forward. </p> <p>These sport-by-sport predictions added up to an Athens medal total of over 50. In case you have forgotten, in Sydney, our most successful games in more than 50 years, we won 28 medals. So the sports themselves, like the football fan, are perhaps not the best judges of their ability to perform. UK Sport does not publish these aspirations, because they would give an unfair appraisal of our medal-winning capacity and therefore lead to accusations of underperformance. </p> <p>That being said, one or two sports, particularly athletics, know that the post-Athens financial position will be very different from Sydney. Some impartiality is therefore required and, depending on where you look, the good news is that most predictions have Team GB performing only slightly down on the dizzy heights of Sydney. </p> <p>Long respected for its expertise in this field, the Italian Olympic organisation, Coni, has echoed a widely held opinion that there will be a growing spread of medals, reflecting the global nature of the games. </p> <p>As countries such as Greece and South Korea can do well in major football tournaments, so the smaller nations can excel at the Olympics, particularly as they need only one talented individual to reach the medal table. The top 10 nations are likely to take a smaller proportion of the medals as their dominance is eroded. </p> <p>Coni has predicted that Great Britain will win as many as 25 medals, only three down on Sydney. However, the reduction is primarily in gold medals, with eight or nine suggested against 11 four years ago. Given a lot of the negative publicity around athletics, this would seem a very strong outcome if it is right, though cycling is likely to be our most successful sport. </p> <p>The same figure of 25 is reached by Pricewaterhousecoopers, whose study uses wide-ranging parameters such as post-performance, population size, host-nation status and funding ability. It also anticipates the emergence of the smaller nations and predicts that the big four, the United States, Russia, Germany and Australia, may lose as many as 80 medals from their Sydney tallies. The Australian Institute of Sport has an expectation of five fewer gold medals and an overall reduction of 20% from the country's Sydney total. </p> <p>The big winner could be Greece, jumping from 13 to 29 medals. London 2012 take note. Japan is also tipped, alongside China, to improve. </p> <p>In order to climb the medal ladder, some nations are effectively hiring athletes to compete under flags of convenience. Others simply target one or two sports or disciplines and pour all their resources in that direction. </p> <p>Against all this, Team GB are shaping up well in the knowledge that future government funding may depend on their ability to reach the target, set by UK Sport, of being in the world's top five sporting nations. As to other financial matters, the bookies will probably win again. But if you fancy a flutter, don't blame me - I'm a Sunderland fan.</p>",
  "The case of a Saudi diplomat suspected of indecently assaulting a young girl in London has led to calls for the centuries-old conventions of diplomatic immunity to be scrapped or significantly altered. <p>The case in question is a dramatic one: a 41-year-old man may have assaulted an 11-year-old girl but the police have no power to investigate. </p> <p>The Saudi embassy has promised a thorough investigation and a trial for the man in Saudi Arabia if the claims have foundation. This must be little comfort to her parents, as the system puts him out of reach of British justice. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said that in 2002, 21 diplomats out of a community of 20,000 were accused of what it considers serious offences, those which would carry a penalty of 12 months or more in prison. In only two or three of these cases was immunity waived. </p> <p>It is serious offences that have former home office minister Barbara Roche and human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson calling for change.</p> <p>But diplomats have been quick to criticise Ms Roche's stance. The present law on immunity dates from the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/diplomat.htm\">1961 Vienna Convention</a> and has near global support. </p> <p>The idea that all 177 signatory countries would agree to change a system that by and large serves their needs is fantasy, says Malcolm Forster, the joint head of public international law at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. </p> <p>Moreover, it is precisely against serious charges that diplomatic immunity is necessary, diplomats say. An unfriendly regime looking to harass a diplomat is unlikely to accuse him of double parking. </p> <p>Oliver Miles was the ambassador to Libya when WPC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead by a gunman from within the Libyan embassy in London in April 1984. </p> <p>What appeared in Britain to be the worst excess of diplomatic immunity - that a murderer should be allowed freely to return home and escape prosecution - looked like the best defence of immunity from Mr Miles's vantage point in Tripoli.</p> <p>Had the suspects inside the London embassy been subjected to trial, he and his staff in Libya would have had charges concocted against them and been put on trial, he says. </p> <p>After the shooting, UK authorities entered the Libyan embassy, searched it, and found a gun. That was an illegal intrusion on a sovereign diplomatic building, Mr Miles felt, and it had immediate repercussions for his staff. </p> <p>\"The Libyans promptly moved into our premises and found a gun,\" he says. \"My firm belief is that the Libyans planted that gun.\"</p> <p>The FO considers immunity \"fundamental\", allowing British diplomats to operate independent of local pressures and without fear of harassment in sometimes difficult circumstances. </p> <p>Mr Miles points out that it is not just states with immature or very different legal systems that create problems. When he was serving as an ambassador to the UN in New York in the 1980s, he says IRA supporters were outside the office every day, screaming obscenities at the British staff. The local police took little or no action, he says. </p> <p>He feels that, without immunity, the IRA would have been able to accuse British diplomats of false crimes that would nonetheless have ended up in front of a judge in New York. </p> <p>The most serious action a receiving state can take is to declare a diplomat persona non grata and expel him or her from the country. But if an incident is serious, an embassy may pre-empt such a dramatic move. </p> <p>In 2001, Libya's cultural attach\u00e9 to Britain attacked an anti-Gadafy demonstrator with a metal shelf outside a lecture at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. </p> <p>The Libyan ambassador, aware that the attack could damage delicate relations with Britain and raise fears that the Libyan president was launching a new terror campaign against opponents in exile, immediately expelled the attach\u00e9 without waiting for the Foreign Office to request it. </p> <p>\"Diplomatic immunity does not mean the diplomat is unassailable,\" Mr Forster explains. \"The immunity is the state's, not the diplomat's. The state can waive it against the diplomat's will, and this happens quite a lot when a serious crime has been committed.\"</p> <p>There is also an avenue of redress for victims, he says, although a potentially unsatisfactory one: bring an action against the diplomat in his home country. Immunity only applies in the receiving country, not at home. </p> <p>This is most likely to be effective if a diplomat is expelled swiftly while evidence and witnesses are still fresh. </p> <p>With the recent thaw in relations with Libya, Scotland Yard has begun working on the case of WPC Fletcher alongside Libyan investigators, although after 20 years detectives are not hopeful of a resolution.</p> <p>Even the 21 serious offences diplomats in Britain were accused of in 2002 covered a wide range, from shoplifting to fraud to domestic violence. Quite a few related to drink driving. And often a diplomatic leaves the country before the Foreign Office has a chance to become involved.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said that even in the case of the Saudi diplomat, the public should not think that diplomatic immunity is necessarily the end of the road. </p> <p>\"We have been successful in bringing cases in the past,\" a spokesman says. \"The Saudi diplomat is sort of 'on bail' while the Foreign Office talk with the Saudi embassy.\" </p> <p>In 2002, the Foreign Office succeeded in convincing the Colombian embassy to waive immunity for one of its diplomats, Jairo Soto-Mendoza. He stood trial for the murder of a 23-year-old man, and was cleared at the Old Bailey.</p>"
