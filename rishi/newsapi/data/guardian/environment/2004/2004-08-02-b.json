  "<p>In the glorious days of empire, a gentleman's ears knew what to expect of the sounds of an English summer: tinkling ice cubes in a gin and tonic; rippling applause from the cricket pavilion; the clunk of a neatly swung croquet mallet. In the intervening years, however, our aural landscape began to change. These days, a chap is more likely to tune in to a party in the park or a rowdy street carnival. And jolly old croquet has disappeared from the public consciousness. In modern Britain, croquet suffers from a distinctly provincial image; manicured lawns presided over by officious \"life-member\" committee men munching cucumber sandwiches. Cliche perhaps, but as a representation of \"association croquet\", the prevalent form of the sport in the UK, it is pretty accurate. </p> <p>Last year, the game's status as a fusty colonial-era relic seemed to be confirmed by Lord McLaurin, then chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, who warned that should his own sport fail to get its administrative house in order, cricket was in danger of becoming \"a former sport of the summer ... like croquet\". Predictably, responses of jowl-wobbling indignation hit the letters desk of the Daily Telegraph. Yet amid the grumbling from croquet clubs around the country were some more progressive voices. </p> <p>For the past two decades a quiet war has been raging over the future of this quintessentially British pastime. It is a story of sporting rebellion in middle England and of how a sedate summer diversion became an ally of feminism in the patriarchal society of the Arab world. </p> <p>With its origins in 13th-century France, the game of association croquet dates back to Ireland in the 1830s. After crossing the Irish sea, it eventually became the founding sport of the All England Club in 1877, before making the mistake of throwing its lot in with another fledging summer sport, lawn tennis. During the Edwardian era, the game enjoyed aristocratic patronage and throughout the first world war was considered a civilising influence against the horrors of that particular conflict. </p> <p>Put simply, the aim of association croquet is to manoeuvre two balls through a series of hoops before striking them against a peg at the centre of the lawn. By a combination of \"running\" hoops and striking an opponent's balls, players build a tally of points in the way a snooker player might build a break. The better the player, the longer he can keep his opponent out of the game. </p> <p>Among more accomplished exponents, the game's labyrinthine tactics can turn matches into esoteric mental jousts, likened by enthusiasts to \"chess on grass\". For the beginner, the downside is that it can take two years until you have the faintest idea of what's going on. </p> <p>But in recent years, an aggressive interloper has appeared. \"Golf croquet\" was originally developed by British soldiers in officers' clubs around Cairo at the end of the 19th century. Shorter and more combative than association croquet, when the British left, the game was refined by groundstaff at Cairo's Gezira country club. Unlike the break-building tactics of association rules, golf croquet players actively contest hoops - once one ball goes through, a point is scored and play moves to the next hoop. </p> <p>The rapid-fire nature of the game has seen its stock rise swiftly around the world. Last month, when the sixth world golf croquet championships kicked off at the Sussex County Croquet Club in Brighton, there were players from Japan and South Africa. Most spectators, however, had come to see the Egyptians, including the favourite, Salah Hasan, a baby-faced caterer from Cairo, and twice world champion. </p> <p>What makes Egyptians so good at it? \"It's the way we play,\" says Hasan, who believes British players are too cautious. \"In Egypt,\" he says, \"the game is played in highly competitive evening leagues and our long season [August to June] means we are always practising, which in Europe is not possible because of the weather.\" </p> <p>In Egypt, the rise of golf croquet has led to some interesting social repercussions, not least in the sporting aspirations of the country's women. Of Egypt's 2,500 players, around 30% are female. In what remains a male-dominated society, it is one of the rare sports where men and women compete on an equal footing. In 2005, Egypt plans to host the first women-only world championship. </p> <p>Leading the charge back in Brighton is Manal Ali Mohsen, a politics graduate from Cairo who, in just four years, has risen to become Egypt's number-two woman player. The number one, Naheed Hassan, has been playing for 30 years. \"In Egypt,\" says Ali Mohsen, \"women use golf croquet as a social occasion. Players come from tight communities and my mother played for 30 years.\" </p> <p>Despite the global inroads made by golf croquet, in Britain the association game remains king. Forty of the world's top 100 players hail from these shores and every two years, when the best of these compete in the MacRobertson Shield - croquet's equivalent of the Ashes and named after Macpherson Robertson, an Australian confectionery millionaire - Britain regularly steals the honours. </p> <p>But things could have been different. On April 7 1984 at the Hurlingham Club in London, the Croquet Association, the game's ruling body, held an annual general meeting to vote on an issue threatening to change England's green and pleasant croquet landscape forever. Keen to secure mainstream television coverage for the sport, a splinter movement had put together a pilot television programme. Believing it to have wider appeal than the ponderous association game, they chose to promote golf croquet, then little-known in Britain. The BBC was interested - now all that was required was for the game's hierarchy to rubberstamp the project. </p> <p>Parking his tanks on the establishment's lawns was Stephen Mulliner, who had earned his association stripes, but was also one of the few Englishmen to have come close to challenging the Egyptian hegemony by placing fourth in the 2000 world championships. </p> <p>In 1984, he believed the opportunity to milk the cash cow feeding other minority sports was too good to miss. \"We were coming out of a bit of a recession and advertising revenues had begun to pick up,\" he says. \"Incongruous as its seems, our main rivals [for sponsorship] were snooker and darts and they had got their feet back in the door.\" And in golf croquet, he argued, \"the emphasis is on one hoop at a time and it's far more telegenic\". </p> <p>The game's old guard panicked, fearing this bastard version of the game would swamp Britain's clubs and sound a death knell for the association format. The vote itself was the sweetest of English fudges. Of the Croquet Association's 1,500 membership, only 73 - less than 5% - bothered to turn up. After intense lobbying, the result could hardly have been closer: 35 members voted in favour of promoting golf croquet on television, 36 against. </p> <p>Still, Mulliner remains optimistic. \"The extravagant statements made about the doom that would engulf the association game have proved nonsense,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Golf croquet is now the lifeblood of some of our smaller clubs. It's the better contest. Some association players may not like it ... but the writing's on the wall.\"</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another win: the way the game is scheduled these days success is coming so thick and fast that one victory seems to blend into another. We will be getting blas\u00e9 next. </p> <p>But the England cricket team, once every stand-up comic's metaphor for abject failure - occasionally justifiably - really is surfing the big one at the moment. </p> <p>Not without reason are Michael Vaughan's side ranked second best in the world, behind Australia and closing the gap. The next 13 months, during which England go to South Africa and Australia go to India and then next summer to England for the Ashes series, will answer a lot of questions. Nothing is quite so clear-cut any more. </p> <p>Vaughan and his side are on a roll the like of which has not been seen from an England side since the mid-1970s, when Kerry Packer stole the jewels from many national crowns. For a period of 33 matches then, following immediately the drubbing by West Indies in 1976, England, under Tony Greig initially and then Mike Brearley, won 18 matches and lost only four: to India, Australia twice and New Zealand. </p> <p>The current team have won 15 of 22 matches since they lost to Australia in Melbourne the Christmas before last, losing only to South Africa twice and Sri Lanka. Furthermore there have been eight wins in the last nine matches without defeat and, of course, five in a row this summer. </p> <p>They have some way to go before matching the remarkable achievement of Steve Waugh's Australians, in winning 16 straight Tests, or even the 11 in a row attained by the marauding West Indians under Clive Lloyd. Two other teams, Sri Lanka and South Africa, have managed nine straight wins. </p> <p>The best by England is seven, first by Arthur Shrewsbury, Walter Read and Allan Steel between 1884-5 and 1887-8 and again by Percy Chapman between 1928 and the end of the following winter. </p> <p>Given a fair wind, Vaughan (and Marcus Trescothick, of course, who captained in the first match of the summer to set off the sequence) will equal that by the end of this series. </p> <p>It was a year ago last Wednesday that an emotional Nasser Hussain relinquished the captaincy he so valued and handed it on to Vaughan. With the series against South Africa midstream, it seemed a hospital pass at the time and under the circumstances no one could reasonably have foreseen the manner in which the side has blossomed since. </p> <p>In the process Vaughan, determined but understated when compared with his predecessor, has remarkably, for the time being anyway, become the second most successful captain in the history of the game, of those who have led their country more than a dozen times. </p> <p>Way out ahead is Waugh, who won 71.9% of matches in which he led Australia. But Vaughan has won 11 of 17 games - 64.71% - better than any other England captain. (WG Grace with 61.54%, Douglas Jardine with 60%, followed by Brearley and Chapman's 58.06% and 52.94% respectively, are closest.) It is better, too, than Don Bradman with his \"Invincibles\" (62.5%) and Clive Lloyd (48.65%) and Viv Richards (54%) with the all-conquering West Indies. </p> <p>In fact the record of recent England captains is an illustration of how the side has grown up: Graham Gooch managed 29.41%, Mike Atherton 24.07%, Alec Stewart 26.67% and Hussain 37.78%. Vaughan is reaping the dividends of the hard work that went in to create the environment for his players to flourish. </p> <p>But there is a glaring anomaly. Brearley's figures might be distorted by the fact that he never led England against West Indies, the best side in the world at the time, as Vaughan has yet to be tested against the Australians. We will have more idea after next summer as to his real worth, although his strategic good sense seems to be coming on apace with the performances of his players. </p> <p>As it stands, though, it is hard to assess the relative strengths of the two sides. More England players - Vaughan himself, Andy Flintoff, Graham Thorpe and Steve Harmison - would get into the Australian side than a year ago, when Vaughan alone would have made the cut. </p> <p>A year hence, fitness allowing, the England bowling attack will be significantly better: more experienced, fitter, greater in depth. That of Australia will be a year older, which is not the same thing. Glenn McGrath is scarcely the force he was, Jason Gillespie is brilliant but physically fragile and Brett Lee was panned all over the park by the Indian batsmen last winter. England play spin better now than two years ago. </p> <p>Australia's batting will be formidable, but then so, when the confidence is flowing, is England's. </p> <p>But, when McGrath feels the need to start his pathetic war of words this early (only 3-0 because the weather is bound to interfere, he says), one has to wonder if the Australians are not just a bit concerned that the wheel is turning perceptibly. This is going to be a mighty year. </p> <p><strong> Current world Test ratings </strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Australia 129 </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> <strong> England</strong> 107 </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> South Africa 106 </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Pakistan 105 </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> India 104 </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Sri Lanka 99 </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> New Zealand 94 </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> West Indies 76 </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> Zimbabwe 51 </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> Bangladesh 1 </p> <p><strong> The leading England Test captains</strong> </p> <p><strong> Michael Vaughan</strong> </p> <p>Matches 17, wins 11, win%64.71 </p> <p> <strong> WG Grace</strong> </p> <p> Matches 13, wins 8, win%61.54 </p> <p> <strong> Douglas Jardine</strong> </p> <p> Matches 15, wins 9, win%60 </p> <p> <strong> Mike Brearley</strong> </p> <p> Matches 31, wins 18, win%58.06 </p> <p> <strong> Percy Chapman</strong> </p> <p> Matches 17, wins 9, win% 52.94</p>",
  "<p>There are people around who are more committed than ever to Sven-Goran Eriksson. Unfortunately they can be accommodated in a single dressing room. Should the England manager survive to be reunited with his squad for the friendly with Ukraine on August 18 he might well receive an ovation. More than ever, the Swede is one of them. </p> <p>These footballers will always believe that they were jointly persecuted by Mark Palios when he was adamant that their team-mate Rio Ferdinand could not be considered for the vital match against Turkey. With the chief executive forced to resign after claims of a plot to throw the manager to a tabloid mauling, Eriksson can be counted as bearing the honourable wounds of tyrannical officialdom. </p> <p>That may all be utter nonsense but nonsense is formidable when it is deeply held. Knowing he can be sure of an affinity with the players, Eriksson is not bluffing when he chats proprietorially about the World Cup qualifiers to come. With each passing hour the mission to sack him looks increasingly like a risk the FA executive board dare not take. </p> <p>One body of legal opinion even proposes that it should do everything possible to persuade him not to resign. By this argument an Eriksson who was no longer in employment could sue for constructive dismissal and cite the FA's sulphurous proposal to the News of the World. Considering that the remainder of his contract is worth \u00a314m or more, this is a case that must be prevented from entering a courtroom. </p> <p>David Davies, sensitive as a seismograph to each shift in circumstance, made it virtually his first duty as acting chief executive yesterday to extol Eriksson. That could be interpreted as a coded warning to the board not to do anything rash at its meeting on Thursday. Equally it prepared the public for the Swede continuing as leader of the national team. </p> <p>The popular view of him has been reversed and, in the process, so are the circumstances with which he must deal. On arrival in 2001 each victory for a team that had been floundering was greeted with delirious relief. Now he should be steeling himself for sneers when England win their fixtures. </p> <p>Group Six of the World Cup qualifiers looks disastrously simple for him. How can Eriksson galvanise the nation when there is no Germany to be slain 5-1 and the pedestrian programme comprises Poland, Austria, Wales, Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan? Even if England lose somewhere, the side would still advance since the equally matched lesser teams will all hamper one another. </p> <p>The prospect is as colourless as Eriksson at his worst. It will be impossible for him to challenge the perception that he is a mature coach so stuck in his ways that his reaction to the 1-0 leads in the eventual Euro 2004 defeats was to squash England into a defensive posture that does not suit Premiership players who pass the ball well only when in an attacking posture. </p> <p>The criticisms will continue to hang over everything he now does. Even the compulsively polite FA director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking gave a well-bred denunciation of the efforts in Portugal. But the imperturbable Eriksson looks like the very last person to walk away in despair over his drop in esteem. </p> <p>The FA, for its part, probably cannot contemplate the sort of settlement that would persuade him to surrender the job and, even if it could, the setting aside of large sums for such a purpose would become another scandal. In the long term, unfortunately, keeping Eriksson will have financial implications of its own. </p> <p>It is instructive to go to a major tournament and witness how extensive an interest there is in England's affairs. In addition to enjoying the largest support at Euro 2004 of any team other than the hosts, they could attract perhaps twice as many journalists as Portugal to their press conferences. They came from all across the world, testifying to the global reach of the Premiership. </p> <p>England are a lucrative business for the FA. That income will hold up in television and sponsorship deals with far-off expiry dates but a slump in enthusiasm for the national team would eventually have its consequences. Even in the short term fewer replica jerseys will be shifted. </p> <p>The next opportunity to rekindle the passion might not arise until major fixtures at the World Cup finals in Germany. Eriksson could step aside following that competition but until then everyone would have to live with the sight of a manager serving out an effective two-year notice period.</p>",

The defeat of George Bush in November would be a start, but not the end of the rift; however Europeans and Americans aren't on completely different planets. <br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713997648/guardianunlim-21\"> Buy Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals the Opportunity of our Time at Amazon.co.uk</a></p> <p> <b>Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat former MEP and prospective parliamentary candidate for Sheffield Hallam</b><br> I shall be reading Helena Kennedy's Just Law to fill a major gap in my knowledge about the flaws in our criminal justice system.

I would give a decade of my life to have had the book published 40 or 30 or 20 years ago when the useless fools of the left swallowed the nostrums of Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky just as today's useless fools of the rights swallow the reactionary rubbish of populist, xenophobic neo-liberals. It is a joy to read. But too long. But why is there no new Lytton Strachey? Give me 200 pages of compelling iconoclastic prose in which every sentence works in place of these tombstone books twice as long as the new EU constitution and rarely more readable. Is there a new novel by Robert Wilson? No English novelist has held me so tight as his political-sociological-historical thrillers set in wartime Lisbon or modern Seville. I would like to take Clinton's My Life with me but I just cannot read it. I have never heard such a compelling speaker with such political, populist, and policy intellectual depth. An hour at a seminar with Clinton and you see why he rewrote the book of progressive politics for his generation. But as so often, the great communicators cannot write and the great writers cannot communicate. Tim Garton Ash's new book on the joys of freedom lies waiting to be devoured. Right now, Britain is the cream of the cream in our current crop of intellectuals who produce important histories, global analyses, and prescriptive manuals. Garton Ash is one of the stars. An MP friend, James Purnell, has just sent me David Ceserani's book on the left and Jews. Jewish humanism is a vital component of 20th century socialism. The next great find will be for Islam to find terms of trade with secular social democracy. As Turkey gets closer to the EU - unless blocked by the reactionary right or the stupid populist left - watch out for some real writing out of this vital new centre of European energy. <br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0753817667/guardianunlim-21\"> Buy Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar at Amazon.co.uk</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631167765/guardianunlim-21\"> Buy The Making of Modern Anglo-Jewry at Amazon.co.uk</a></p> <p> <b>Jackie Ashley, Guardian columnist</b><br> I'll be taking Anthony Seldon's new biography of Blair which I've dipped into a lot, but am looking forward to the chance to read it in its entirety.

  "<p>Britain's manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in nearly a decade as foreign and domestic orders surged, official figures showed today.</p> <p>The closely-watched Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's purchasing managers' index (PMI), a compilation of separate indices to measure overall activity, stood at 56.3, with a reading above 50 representing growth. </p> <p>The figure - compared with a revised figure of 55 for June - was the highest since October 1994. The strong showing for manufacturing - for so long the ugly duckling in the UK economy - makes it all but certain that the Bank of England will raise interest rates this week. This would be the fifth upward move since November. </p> <p>Rates currently stand at 4.5%, a percentage point above where they were at the end of last year. </p> <p>Today's data follow a spate of strong economic indicators, from a resurgence in house prices, record levels of household debt - Britons now owe a total of \u00a31 trillion - and buoyant sales figures. </p> <p>The Bank of England has already expressed concern that strong economic growth is building up inflationary pressure.</p> <p>Some analysts say the Bank's monetary policy committee needs to push up rates by 50 basis points on Thursday if it really wants to take some wind out of the economy. But that is unlikely to happen as Bank officials have made it clear that they have no interest in \"clobbering\" the consumer.</p> <p>\"We still expect a 25 basis point interest rate hike on Thursday. However, we believe a further 25 basis point interest rate hike in September is highly likely unless there is clear evidence of a slowdown in retail sales, consumer borrowing and house prices over the next month,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>Today's figures backed up last month's official data, showing a 0.5% expansion in manufacturing between April and May. The CIPS report reflected continued growth in output and new orders within the manufacturing sector. </p> <p>The index for output accelerated to 59.5 against a revised level of 57.9 for June, while the new orders index rose to 58.1. High oil prices pushed up the cost of materials such as plastic and chemical products, and contributed to a rise in input prices for the 11th month running. </p> <p>However, the pace of growth was driven by strong domestic and international demand. Roy Aycliffe, director of professional practice at CIPS, said: \"Despite rising costs, firms stepped up their purchase of raw materials to meet increasing demand and guard against future supply shortages.\" </p> <p>Today's report also showed an increase in manufacturing staff numbers for the fourth successive month.</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices hit a new high today after the US warned of a possible attack on leading financial institutions.</p> <p>The US security alert, coming on top of worries about Russian production over the Yukos affair, pushed oil prices close to $44 (\u00a324) a barrel, 12 cents above Friday's close and their highest level since oil futures were launched on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983. </p> <p>The Bush administration yesterday raised its security alert a notch to \"high\", saying it had received intelligence of a possible al-Qaida attack on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the New York Stock Exchange and other financial institutions such as Citigroup and Prudential Financial.</p> <p>\"The threat alert is bringing more confusion and uncertainty into the market,\" John Brady an analyst at ABN Amro in New York, told Reuters. The head of BP forecast at the weekend that oil prices were unlikely to decline soon. </p> <p>\"What with the insecurity of supply, the price seems to be holding up quite high,\" John Browne, the chief executive of BP told BBC Television yesterday. \"One day it will come down, but not in the very short term I'm afraid.\" </p> <p>Oil prices were already under pressure before the latest security alert amid fears of disruption to supplies from Russia, the world's second-biggest supplier, because of financial problems at Yukos, the oil giant.</p> <p>Yukos has said it could collapse by mid-August because of a freeze on its bank accounts and assets over a $3.4bn tax bill. Russian bailiffs have given Yukos a month to pay the debt. </p> <p>Any disruption to Russian exports would stretch already tight global stockpiles and leave the Opec producers' group with little power to make up for shortages.</p> <p>The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls more than half of world crude exports, raised its official production ceiling on Sunday by 500,000 barrels a day to 26 million. Opec is pumping well over official output limits at its highest levels for 25 years, and only Saudi Arabia has any significant spare capacity to boost production during emergencies.</p>",
  "<p>Rich and poor countries last night pledged to secure a new global trade accord by the end of next year after a week of intensive negotiations banished immediate fears of a new era of protectionism by agreeing to cut deep into the west's lavish farm subsidies. </p> <p>Negotiators described as \"historic\" an 11th-hour deal in Geneva early yesterday which ended almost a year of wrangling between the developed and developing world over the shape of a new trade liberalisation agreement designed to offer access to lucrative western markets for poor nations. </p> <p>Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, said he was now hopeful that the talks could be completed by the time trade ministers next meet in Hong Kong in December 2005, following last-minute concessions by both Washington and Brussels to appease the developing world. </p> <p>With a US presidential election looming and a wholesale change to the European Commission imminent, the World Trade Organisation had warned that a fresh impasse would set back the prospects of a deal for years and might create the conditions for a global trade war. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, trade and industry secretary, said: \"This is a crucial step on the road to delivering a trade round that will benefit all of us, especially developing countries. An ambitious round is an important prize for the global economy and we must continue to make progress before next year's ministerial meeting in Hong Kong.\" </p> <p>Under the agreement signed in Geneva, the 147 members of the World Trade Organisation agreed to a framework for liberalising trade in agriculture, manufacturing and services, as well as updating customs procedures that have re mained unchanged for more than half a century. </p> <p>Economists have estimated that a final deal could add more than $500bn a year to the size of the global economy, but some trade negotiators and most development groups warned last night the draft was biased in favour of the West and there was much to do to secure a deal that would benefit poor countries. </p> <p>In an attempt to prevent a re-run of the fiasco in Cancun 10 months ago when the gulf between rich and poor countries proved unbridgeable, the compromise package agreed at the weekend was kept deliberately vague. </p> <p>\"Today multilateralism has made a minor triumph,\" said the WTO director general, Supachai Panitchpakdi. \"The major triumph will be the day we achieve the Doha Development Agenda\" - the name of the round launched in November 2001. </p> <p>Negotiators agreed to eliminate export subsidies and other forms of government support for farm exports, but provided no timetable for reform. Under pressure from Brazil and India, the EU and the US also offered a \"down payment\" that would see an immediate 20% cut in the maximum permitted payments by rich nations. </p> <p>The highest agricultural import tariffs will face the biggest cuts, although no figures have yet been agreed upon. Nations will have the right to keep higher tariffs on some of the products they consider most important. </p> <p>Brazil said it marked the beginning of the end for western farm subsidies, which add around \u00a316 a week to the average food bill in the UK and hinder export of agricultural goods from poor countries. But Andrew Pendleton of Christian Aid said: \"If everything that is written down in that text was agreed, it would be beginning to look better for a lot of the poorest countries. </p> <p>\"The reason I am being so guarded is the commitment on export subsidies is pretty clear and explicit, but there is no timetable - that is the absolutely critical factor.\" </p> <p>Celine Charveriat, of Oxfam, said there was little in the deal to guarantee reforms that would help the poorest countries, and the deal overall was disappointing. </p> <p>But the mood in Geneva was one of relief after a series of marathon negotiating sessions had repaired damage caused by the failure in Cancun. </p>",
  "<p>As a neuroscientist, I'm increasingly being asked about creativity. Perhaps it is just as we feel that we might be losing it in the face of new technologies, that it becomes even more precious. </p> <p>Creativity is so valuable, and one of the most sophisticated of human traits, that it is very hard to relate it directly to the banal physical bump and grind of everyday brain cells (neurons). </p> <p>Although we are born with pretty much all the brain cells we will ever have, I believe it is the growth of the connections between these cells that accounts for the growth of the brain after birth. And what is amazing about the brain is that it is constantly evolving every moment we are alive, so that although born into \"a booming, buzzing confusion\" where we unconditionally receive any information coming in, as we start to personalise and build up literally networks of associations, then we start to evaluate the world in terms of what we've experienced already.</p> <p>Whilst this might be a neuroscientist's view of the physical basis of creativity within the brain, it does not answer the question of why some are more creative than others. Personally, I feel at my most creative when I am relaxed and have time to leave one association to lead into another, without the constraints of the normal checks and balances that we apply.</p> <p>Given that, at least for me, creativity comes from silence, space, the right kind of one-on-one dialogue, and being away from the press of the bustling working environment, it is hard to think how we might turn that work environment into a place conducive to having ideas.</p> <p>I find brainstorming, where there is more than one other person, counterproductive. It becomes a social challenge to get a word in edgeways, and listening to others starts to take up time and social rules take over. This is one of many reasons why working in committee, for me, is not very edifying. </p> <p>Time has to be taken listening to everyone's views and the consequent efficiency of the thought-processes inevitably goes down. The big problem with the triggering of ideas by other people is that they have to be just the right sort of people. </p> <p>We have to have the confidence to express ourselves freely and use a kind of shorthand: the kind that can only come from knowing someone so well we don't have to explain the underlying premises.</p> <p>The other big area that is relevant to my own study in this regard, is the impact of the new technologies on the way we think. We are currently living in an information age that is answer-rich but question-poor, where people put a premium on facts and can get access to them fast and furiously. </p> <p>But there is a big difference between information and knowledge. We all know from the low premium we put on pub quizzes, or Trivial Pursuit, that facts on their own are not particularly interesting - it is only when one fact relates to another and we have an idea, that human beings come into their own. And the more disparate the two disciplines connected by the idea, the more exciting.</p> <p>The problem as I see it for the future, is that the increasing use of computers, keyboards and screens, of accessing information rather than reflecting on knowledge, works against creativity. If, as I have suggested, we need to be not distracted on a much slower time-frame in order to be creative, it is very hard to reconcile that notion, with the fast and furious multimedia bombardment with which many of our young people now take as the norm. </p> <p>After all, the ability to concentrate in the absence of any strong sensory input, for example when reading a book, is something we all developed when we were small children. Nonetheless, it was a skill we had to learn - that's the importance of having stories read to us, so that gradually we can be weaned off second-hand images of pictures, and substitute instead our own imaginations. </p> <p>For me this is crucial to creativity and I fear that those given second-hand images so quickly and readily on the screen may struggle to sit with just a plain piece of paper and a pen.</p> <p>On the other hand, it could be argued that the 21st century demands a different type of mindset - one perhaps that might design web pages, that thinks with the mouse under the finger or connects up with other individuals. I think increasingly we are drifting towards a situation where we are working more collectively. </p> <p>Not only does the web unify us all but soon smart devices will mean increasingly efficient computing and informatics, meaning that we do not need to remember facts at all. If we are having conversations and accessing inanimate objects as a source of the information, then increasingly we will become interdependent in terms of developing knowledge and having ideas as we speak. </p> <p>It might be, therefore, that we have ideas as a collective, where it is very hard to pin down to each component individual. If the individual as such then ceases to exist then whether this means that creativity as we know it will also cease to exist, is another matter.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Baroness Susan Greenfield, writing for the Space for Ideas campaign running in the east of England <a href=\"http:www.spaceforideas.uk.com\">spaceforideas.uk.com</a> to encourage creativity in businesses.</p>",

  "<p>RWE Thames Water, the German-owned company with 14.5m customers in England and Wales, is poised to raise several hundred million pounds through the sale of its international business. </p> <p>Thames, which has become a crucial source of profits at indebted RWE, making \u20ac295m (\u00a3195m) in the first half of this year, is expected to sell off its operations in Indonesia and Turkey, with Japanese group Mitsui said to be the frontrunner. Thames sold its Shanghai business to a Chinese group last month. </p> <p>This has emerged on the eve of this week's initial ruling by Philip Fletcher, head of regulator Ofwat, on water and sewerage companies' plans to invest \u00a322bn over the next five years through a 29% real-term increase in consumer bills. </p> <p>Thames, which plans to invest \u00a32bn in modernising London's ageing network of pipes, partly to prevent sewage flooding, is considering referring the final Ofwat ruling to the Competition Commission. </p> <p>Mr Fletcher, who makes his final ruling in December, has come under political pressure to contain price rises that take effect in April 2005 - in the run-up to a likely general election. But environment ministers and lobby groups are pressing for greater spending. </p> <p>Even so, on Thursday he is expected to scale back the companies' investment plans drastically. Last December he suggested that \u00a315bn could be spent but Margaret Beckett, the environment secretary, insisted on a higher figure. </p> <p>Yesterday Thames sources confirmed that RWE, which has net debt of \u20ac17bn, had adopted a strategy of concen trating its water interests in Britain and the US, where American Water, acquired last year, has 20m customers. </p> <p>They refused to comment on reports of a \u00a31bn price tag for the other international operations or to set a firm timetable for the planned sell-off. RWE paid \u00a34.3bn for Thames, Britain's biggest water supplier, in 2001 and spent \u00a33.5bn on the energy group Innogy a year later.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most durable products of the consumer society suffers a further blow to its longevity today when a supermarket chain introduces degradable plastic bags for bread. </p> <p>The announcement by the Co-op - which will transform 55m pieces of food wrapping a year - reflects mounting pressure on the retail industry to tackle the problems of litter and waste generated by excess packaging. </p> <p>Traditional polythene bags can endure for 100 years. The plastic bread bags produced by the Co-op will rot away within a maximum of four years, breaking down into a small organic residue, carbon dioxide and water. </p> <p>Last year Sainsbury's introduced a test range of plastic sacks made with tapioca starch which can decompose within 28 days. </p> <p>The Co-op has also brought in biodegradable bags for shoppers in which they can take home their purchases. </p> <p>The Co-op is now going one step further and using degradable wrapping for bread following a survey of ethical shopping attitudes among consumers which found that six out of 10 people believed retailers should use only degradable or biodegradable materials. </p> <p>\"Some 1.67bn bread bags are produced in the UK every year,\" said a spokeswoman for the supermarket chain. </p> <p>\"With each bag weighing an average of six grams, a massive 10,521 tonnes of waste are generated by bread bags every year. That is equivalent to 30 jumbo jets or 120 tanks. </p> <p>\"Our survey into the ethics of supermarket products demonstrated that on every count - including packaging - consumers are more concerned than they were 10 years ago. </p> <p>\"This initiative demonstrates our [commitment ] to introducing more environmentally sound packaging.\" </p> <p>Threats to impose taxes on plastic bags and government proposals to curb excessive use of plastics through landfill charges have concentrated the minds of those in the industry. </p> <p>When Michael Meacher was environment minister he suggested that the government could follow the example of Ireland, where a tax of about 9p has been levied on every plastic carrier bag. Complaints about discarded bags disfiguring the countryside have added to the clamour for action. </p> <p>Some environmental campaign groups such as Friends of the Earth warn, however, that degradable plastic will fail to decompose fully in the oxygen-depleted environments of waste tips and may cause an increase in greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. </p> <p>Research is already under way into reducing the lifespan of packaging even further, by making it edible. Sainsbury's has investigated the possibility of using edible containers made out of potato starch for three-course meals or dried soup.</p>",

  "<p>In spite of efforts by humanitarian organisations, charities and philanthropic societies, the problem of wealth only gets worse. </p> <p>It is reported there are more billionaires in Moscow than any other city in the world. The United States now has tens of thousands of millionaires. Failing companies distribute extravagant bonuses to redundant executives; a handful of individuals command more wealth than the total GDP of the poorest 50 countries. These unfortunates are compelled to live in enclosures, protected by armed guards, dogs and razor-wire, the internees of excess. </p> <p>They urgently require help in order to be free of the hatred, envy and distrust they engender. The time for pious aspiration is past. They must be empowered towards a self-help capacity-building that will unlock them from the gilded bondage. </p> <p>The scenario for their lives is is already written, inscribed in the deterministic iconography of the meaning of wealth. Pity the constraints this imposes upon them, under constant scrutiny by those who look to them for inspiration and hope, and who mimic their joyless and quasi-mystical quest for transcendence. </p> <p>They must be delivered from the obligations that come with having more than they know what to do with. Why should they be condemned to buy a \u00a32m mansion in a secluded spot as well as holiday villas on at least two continents, with pools, spas and jets of healing waters? Must they forever invest in the fastest, sleekest cars, and buy the compulsory luxuries of designer clothing, hand-crafted shoes, expensive accessories, jewels and fur coats? The private jet may avoid the hassle of paparazzi, fans and imitators, but the headaches remain of which art to invest in, what antique style to adopt for the interiors, what instructions to offer to the bidders at Sotheby's for this or that must-have item. </p> <p>Systems must be set in place to spare them the discreet healthcare in the muted detox clinic, the treatment for the ills of excess, the sojourns in the restorative atmosphere of the padded cells of privacy; as well as the expenditure on medicines, drugs, alcohol and the lavish treatments that will keep ageing and loss at bay. Projects, whether by government, non-government organisations or charities, should be properly funded to help rid them of the value-added miseries of their lives. </p> <p>Of all the onerous luxuries of the rich, nothing is more painful to them than the presence, elsewhere, of grinding, abrading poverty. God knows, the poor have made every effort, they have valiantly survived in order to prevent the enjoyments of the better-off from becoming sterile and savourless. </p> <p>The rich realise that, no matter how much wealth they create, they can do nothing to help their less fortunate brothers and sisters, who voluntarily plunge into degradation and deprivation in order to sustain those flamboyant lifestyles. The rich strive for more, in the hope that one day the satiation of their lives will relieve the destitute, even though there is little sign that their wealth-creating powers have brought about this happy state. </p> <p>Their heroic commitment to over-consumption has led to some revolutionary reversals, so that bankers have become philanthropists, moneylenders the bosom friends of the poor, while landlords cannot do enough to provide them with mortgages, loans, real estate and debt. But still, contrary to all the laws of gravity, wealth fails to trickle down; it flies up with the instinct of homing birds to its proper habitation. </p> <p>The poor have done their best to make wealth more piquant. They have consistently voted for their own preservation, so certain are they that this is the only way towards the alleviation of wealth. All channels have been tried in this noble cause, from redistribution to crime, but the citadels of wealth remain untouched, maintaining their victims immured in the muffled loneliness of their privileged incarceration. </p> <p>The poor have uncomplainingly permitted the flow of riches to go from them, their labour, their substance, their hands, their brains, into the capacious laps of the rich. Despite this continuous transfer of wealth, they remain gorged and suffocated by the dependency culture generated by a surfeit of money. </p> <p>A concerted effort must be made by the UN and international institutions to halve the number of people living in intemperate luxury by 2015. They will be encouraged to understand that wealth has a far wider meaning than the sum of investments, assets, income, dividends, interest and other forms of financial accumulation. This is recognised by most people when they speak of a wealth of experience, a wealth of detail in a work of art, a wealth of natural resources, a commonwealth. </p> <p>Abundance and plenty, like security and sufficiency, are not measurable by the standards which we apply to the pitiful dependency of the rich upon money, which buys only those things procured in the market but is powerless against everything else that makes life worth living. </p> <p>Instruction in basic needs, liberation from the ordeals and anguish of extravagance, practice in the pleasures of the freely given and voluntarily exchanged, initiation into the joy of all the money-less transactions possible between people - a programme of re-education for the rich already exists. All that needs to be done is spread more generally intelligence that the problem with our world has nothing to do with poverty, everything to do with pathological and tendentious descriptions of what is mistakenly called wealth, and which binds the unfortunates of excess to the dependency culture of the global market. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jeremy Seabrook is an author and journalist</p>",

  "A member of Michael Howard's shadow cabinet said yesterday that the Conservative party needs to \"raise its game\" to stand a chance in next year's general election. <p>Speaking after a poll showed a drop in Mr Howard's personal ratings, the shadow environment secretary, Tim Yeo, admitted that the Tories had hit a \"plateau\" after a strong showing in the spring. </p> <p>\"It is of course the case that we need to raise our game,\" he told BBC 1's, Breakfast with Frost. \"We have had a huge mountain to scale. We have made very good progress. </p> <p>\"We are on a bit of a plateau at the moment, I acknowledge that; but you don't do these things all in one go.\" </p> <p>This candid assessment followed a Mori poll giving the Tory leader a personal satisfaction rating worse than that of Neil Kinnock when he was the Labour leader hoping to unseat the Tories from government. </p> <p>In the survey for the Independent on Sunday, 42% were \"dissatisfied\", compared with 26% \"satisfied\", a rating of minus 16 points. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Tories insisted that the poll was good news, since it showed a jump in the party's support by four points in the past month: 31% compared with 27% in a Mori poll for the Financial Times in June. </p> <p>Labour remained on 32%. Mr Yeo said that Mr Howard enjoyed the \"solid support\" of Tory MPs, and that the party was far stronger than under Iain Duncan Smith. </p> <p>\"Now we have a leader who is a credible alternative to Tony Blair. Then, we did not. Now the party is more united than it has been for a decade. Then, it was not. </p> <p>Now it is the Conservatives, actually, who are neck-and-neck with Labour in the overall polls.\" </p> <p>The former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who is contesting the safe seat of Kensington and Chelsea, waded in yesterday, writing in the Observer that Mr Howard should confront Labour on civil liberties. \"The Tory party must be seen in the vanguard of the campaign to protect the traditional freedoms of the British people,\" he wrote. </p> <p>This was the second time in less than a week that he had made pointed remarks, to the irritation of the Howard circle. </p> <p>One senior Tory said: \"Malcolm has ambitions and is looking forward to what might happen if we lose another election. But he should be careful - he will have been out of parliament for eight years by the time of the election.\"</p>"
