  "<p>Contrary to what many on Tyneside expected yesterday morning, Sir Bobby Robson and Newcastle United go marching on together. But for how long? </p> <p>Togetherness, real and alleged, remains the biggest issue at Newcastle. So when Robson disappeared into a meeting with his chairman Freddy Shepherd early yesterday the suspicion was that the two men were organising a mutual separation. </p> <p>This was just hours after a 2-0 lead against Norwich City had become a nervy 2-2 draw, after all, and Robson and his team had been booed from the pitch by a public that does seem to have leaked faith over the past week. On Gallowgate there was anticipation. </p> <p>But 90 minutes later Robson emerged unscathed from Shepherd's office. Robson then maintained the club were still pushing to get Wayne Rooney and he said of his own position: \"I haven't resigned or offered to resign and I have no intention of doing so. I don't do either. </p> <p>\"I do not intend to change the habit of a lifetime and start breaking contracts. I had a meeting with the chairman this morning but that was about acquisitions, nothing else. Walking away is not my style.\" </p> <p>Indeed it is not - this is a man who has survived the fierce world of professional football for 54 years - but there was a melancholy to Robson on Wednesday after the Norwich match, just as there had been after the defeat at home to Tottenham last Saturday. </p> <p>On Wednesday part of Robson's weariness stemmed from Craig Bellamy's post-match interview on television in which Bellamy said he would have to think about moving should Rooney join. </p> <p>Bellamy's statement was rash and in the heat of what felt like another defeat Robson normally would have understood that. But when Bellamy's comments were put to Robson they prompted this reply: \"Listen fella, it's another 'story', it's another 'rift'. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it.\" </p> <p>Such answers stir whispers, yet by yesterday morning Robson was his bullish self again. As he said, he has no intention of walking away, not least from a very comfortable wage. If only Newcastle's defence were to possess the same defiance, then Robson could be more hopeful of a positive result at Aston Villa tomorrow. </p> <p>For the men above Robson, that would make the delicate task of sacking him a treacherous one, though with every passing performance that job becomes less problematic. As one win in nine became one in 10, fewer and fewer fans need to be persuaded of the wisdom of Robson's dismissal. </p> <p>And the men above Robson, it should be remembered, are the Hall family as well as Shepherd. The Halls, Sir John and his son Douglas, own 41% of Newcastle United. Shepherd owns 25%. There are those who think it significant that Sir John Hall is back in the region from his Spanish retreat, and Douglas Hall was at the defeat to Tottenham. It is understood Hall junior is not a Robson loyalist and Saturday's messy second half will hardly have endeared the manager to him. </p> <p>With their bases in Spain and Gibraltar the Halls do not have to deal with the daily fascination and recrimination that accompanies Shepherd at St James' Park. A sacking could be sanctioned and undertaken from a distance. </p> <p>But if they are concerned about a negative reaction nationally, all three men must have had their undoubted and quite deep scepticism about Robson reinforced by an increasing local dissatisfaction. </p> <p>Beyond Tyneside Robson retains a status that one player described as \"the Queen Mum\", but locally that level of affection has been eroded. If the Newcastle Evening Chronicle can be used as a barometer of the feeling among Newcastle supporters, then it makes for sobering reading for Robson. Night after night in black and white, \"go now\" is the verdict. There is also almost universal opposition to the signing of Rooney incidentally. </p> <p>The mood in general is the colour of coal but a good result at Villa, plus the purchase of a new centre-half post-Jonathan Woodgate, would alleviate pressure. </p> <p>But if Robson cannot deliver a win over the next four days then the international break could give Shepherd an opportunity. He already feels he has the reason. Newcastle have not won away in the league since October 21, 2003; finishing 34 points behind Arsenal is another. </p> <p>And now Newcastle are seven points behind Arsenal and Chelsea after only three games. It is, to use a Shepherd word, \"unacceptable\". </p> <p>What would happen next is unclear. Alan Shearer is the obvious answer. Martin O'Neill will always get a mention. But if it is to be Shearer then he would surely appreciate a decision sooner rather than later. His form is showing signs of a player under-confident of his manager's trust and the international break would give him some time to organise. </p> <p>\"This is not the start to the season anyone imagined,\" Shearer said with due understatement yesterday. \"But the only way we will get through this is by sticking together as a group and that is everyone within the whole club. If we do that we will get it right. We must not press panic buttons.\" </p> <p>Panic and togetherness: Tyneside themes.</p>",
  "<b> Independent </b> Editorial, August 26 <br> <p>\"The arrest of Sir Mark Thatcher ... reads like a twist in a rather implausible thriller. All the ingredients are there: exotic location; soldiers of fortune; mysterious puppet masters; political intrigue and, naturally, huge sums of cash.

Still he manages to make an obscene amount of money on the back of his mother's infamy for putting 3.5 million people out of work and consigning a generation to a life of misery and poverty. Now - it is claimed - Sir Mark tried to copy some of his mother's brutal bully-boy tactics and organise a coup in Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>\"The regime in that country is notoriously brutal.

  "<p><strong> Citigroup: new Enron claims</strong><br> </p> <p>Citigroup is facing fresh legal action related to its role as an adviser to Enron, with investors claiming they were duped by a \"massive scheme of deception\" when they bought securities tied to the credit-worthiness of the bankrupt energy firm. </p> <p>The suit could expose Citigroup to billions more dollars in liabilities. The bank was closely linked to a number of the high profile financial scandals of 2002 and in May sharply increased its reserves for legal bills to $6.7bn (\u00a33.7bn). </p> <p>Bank of New York filed the latest lawsuit on behalf of mutual funds and insurance firms who bought Enron notes called Yosemite securities from Citigroup with a face value of $2.4bn. It alleges that Citigroup knew Enron's debts were far higher than it had publicly disclosed. </p> <p>Citigroup, it claims, had at the same time overexposed itself to Enron and was looking for a way out. </p> <p>The complaint alleges fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty and negligence in the note transactions that took place between 1999 and 2001, when Enron filed for bankruptcy protection. A Citigroup spokeswoman denied the bank had engaged in any wrongdoing. </p> <p><strong> Maxwell settles out of court</strong><br> </p> <p>Kevin Maxwell, the son of late disgraced Mirror newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, yesterday appeared to stave off financial meltdown for the second time in a month. </p> <p>Lawyers for creditor Global Investments told Oxford county court that an unspecified debt, believed to be more than \u00a3300,000, had been settled. </p> <p>Earlier this month lawyers for insolvency practice David Rubin &amp; Partners withdrew a winding-up petition against Mr Maxwell's Meynard Freres property business after a deal was reached over an \u00a318,000 debt.

  "<p>Ireland's national airline, Aer Lingus, is to scrap business-class seats on its European routes and may quit the Oneworld global alliance in an effort to reinvent itself as a low-cost carrier. The state-owned airline is struggling to cope with fierce competition from Ryanair. </p> <p>It is facing unrest from unions over plans to slash its workforce by a third, with 1,300 jobs being lost through the use of external contractors. </p> <p>Aer Lingus said demand for premium seats on its short-haul network was \"in rapid decline\" and accounted for only 6% of European passenger traffic. </p> <p>It will remove business-class sections in April from all except transatlantic routes, where passengers will still be able to opt for more legroom, improved food and chauffeur-driven cars to and from airports. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"Aer Lingus is now a low-fares airline, and this decision is in line with the airline's strategy and positioning.\" </p> <p>Aer Lingus said its membership of the eight-strong Oneworld group, which includes BA, American Airlines and Cathay Pacific, was \"currently under review\" and would be discussed when the alliance's chief executives meet in November. </p> <p>Ireland's biggest union, Siptu, met yesterday to discuss the airline's proposals.</p>",
  "<p>The independent directors of DFS appear to want to play Russian roulette with shareholders. At least two big investors, Morley Fund Management and M&amp;G, have broken cover and said they don't want founder and chairman Lord Kirkham's \u00a3496m bid, which the non-execs are supporting. City jungle drums suggest Morley and M&amp;G are not alone in deciding that Lord K is trying to buy the company on the cheap. </p> <p>So the independents are threatening to quit. The trio of non-execs comprises former Halifax boss Mike Blackburn, ex-Rover executive Kevin Morley and one-time Iceland chairman Malcolm Walker, who is still under investigation for al leged insider dealing. Their back-us-or-sack-us warning is a sign they know the deal is in deep trouble. </p> <p>Because the independents are backing their chairman's bid, it is only natural they would have to consider their position if the shareholders blow them a king-size raspberry. A rejection would be the same as a vote of no confidence. </p> <p>The key point, as the independents see it, is the continued involvement of Lord Kirkham in the business he has built up over 35 years. So far Lord K has felt unable to give any assurances that he will stay with the company. </p> <p>It will not have escaped anyone's attention, either, that he is free to leave on his 60th birthday this year. </p> <p>So will he and his independent directors walk away? And does it matter? </p> <p>As far as the non-execs are concerned the answer is clearly in the negative. They can be replaced. </p> <p>The case of Lord Kirkham is very different. If he trots off to his country pile in a huff, the company would be faced with a very difficult succession issue. True, it is one that will have to be faced some time, but a managed succession is always better than force majeure. </p> <p>This deal was bad from the outset, as the chairman tried to buy the company on the cheap. He may now be offering a better deal but shareholders' trust in their director's judgment has evaporated. They have seen too many retail assets whipped off into the private sector to generate fat profits for a chosen few. </p> <p>Threats or no threats, investors should not be cowed now. They would certainly not be alone if the shares took a bath in a post-Kirkham era. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham himself has 10%. </p> <p><strong>Blarney needed</strong><br> </p> <p>They must have been chortling in the galleys of Ryanair's fleet of Boeings. The upstart low-cost carrier scored a totemistic victory over its nationalised rival yesterday as Aer Lingus called time on its business-class services throughout Europe. </p> <p>In its latest cunning plan, Aer Lingus intends to turn itself into a \"low fares\" airline by shedding a third of its workforce, outsourcing its catering, eliminating membership of the Oneworld alliance and scaling down its cargo operations. </p> <p>It was not so long ago that one of Aer Lingus's distinctive green and white aircraft, complete with a shamrock on the tail, could bring tears to the eyes of an Irish expatriate. But there is little sentimentality left in the cash-strapped aviation industry. </p> <p>Michael O'Leary's Ryanair is the preferred mode of carriage for the canny Irish diaspora. The budget airline carried 21m passengers last year on 71 aircraft. Aer Lingus conveyed 6.5m customers on a 33-strong fleet. </p> <p>Aer Lingus's boss, Willie Walsh, is more measured in his blarney than O'Leary. But they both like to play the \"common man\" card. When he was appointed in 2001, Walsh's spin doctors made much of his battered Honda and his two-room flat in the Dublin suburb of Darndale. </p> <p>Walsh's strategy is sensible. Without the trappings of hot food, free newspapers and extra legroom, Aer Lingus can at least get its fares in the same ballpark as Ryanair. It can then play on the benefits of flying to airports closer to city centres. </p> <p>Whether the strategy is right for Ireland as a whole is another matter. Should an island nation with strong American links scale down its air freight operations? What will the impact be on exports? </p> <p>Aer Lingus needs to be on its persuasive best to stave off industrial action. Reform is crucial if the carrier is to avoid joining the likes of Swiss and Alitalia in the sick ward of Europe's airlines. </p> <p><strong>Supermarket queue</strong><br> </p> <p>The latest TNS Superpanel data on the fortunes of our supermarkets shows Tesco still going like a train. The grocer has 28.1% of the market - and counting. </p> <p>Its rivals look worryingly jaded. There is Sainsbury's, whose market share has slumped from 16.1% to 15.4%. Its top line sales are actually ahead of last year. But it slips further behind because the market is growing faster. </p> <p>Morrisons is gaining from the Safeway stores it switches to its own fascia - but that improvement is more than offset by the carnage in the old Safeway. Asda continues to progress, albeit more slowly than Tesco. </p> <p>If the TNS data proves anything it is that Tesco got away with murder when it was allowed to buy the T&amp;S chain of convenience stores. If it proves something else, it is that any more acquisition plans should be sent straight to the Competition Commission.</p>",
  "<p>Parlour games were once the preserve of Victorian dinner parties. Over the years, families have spent countless Sunday afternoons engaging in a few rounds of charades or an epic bout of Monopoly. But as technology pushes traditional games on to computers and consoles, a new generation of digital parlour games is taking root. </p> <p>One of those leading the charge is SingStar for the Sony PlayStation 2. At first glance it seems a lot like karaoke - players sing in time to a range of popular hits that play without the original vocals. But unlike the original Japanese concept, the game combines singalong interactivity with software that can assess a singer's pitch and timing through a microphone. In a game of SingStar, the PS2 compares your voice to the original vocal track and awards you points for good singing. </p> <p>With both Sony and karaoke originating in Japan, you would be forgiven for thinking SingStar is Japanese. Not so. SingStar was devised and produced in London by a bunch of twenty-somethings in Sony's corporate headquarters in Soho. The team, whose oldest member is 29, spent four-and-a-half years developing the game - the longest ever gestation period for a PlayStation title. </p> <p>For the first two-and-a-half years, one person worked on the project - Sharu Gupta, a 27-year-old computer engineer from Hammersmith. In 1999, fresh out of college, Gupta realised the sound processors in the original PlayStation could be used not just for output, but for sound input, too. </p> <p>\"I was asked to develop software for pitch detection,\" she explains in a replica living room on the seventh floor of Sony's London offices. \"I started taking recordings of piano scales and wrote some software that would analyse each note and tell me what it was.\" It was, she says, a modest breakthrough - but one that eventually led to SingStar. </p> <p>The game features 40 licensed hits from the premier league of pop. SingStar players go on an eclectic excursion through mainstream pop history, taking the place of Madonna, Ricky Martin or even Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead. Microphones allow players to sing solo, in a duet or battle head-to-head with friends. \"It is perfect for anyone who has ever sung into their hairbrush,\" offers Gupta. </p> <p>Somewhat surprisingly, given karaoke's global popularity, Sony insists that SingStar has little to do with the clunky, back-of-the-pub karaoke experience redolent of drunken nights. \"Karaoke has been a fast, dirty and cheap product where the graphics are crappy and nobody cares,\" says the game's 27-year-old Canadian producer, Paulina Bozek. </p> <p>SingStar is just the latest example of the \"21st-century parlour game\" - a diverse, but growing, category of games that use peripheral accessories such as microphones instead of traditional joystick control. Konami's Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), a hyperactive dancing game, uses a dance mat and has even been responsible for part of a new fitness fad in the US. One man in Hawaii claimed to have shed more than 30 pounds after months of daily DDR. </p> <p>The Sony EyeToy - developed by the same studio as SingStar - uses motion capture software and a camera to track the physical gestures of players. Nintendo, Sony's arch-rival, is set to join the fray with its take on the genre. Donkey Konga, a frantic drumming game, was previewed at this year's E3 show in Los Angeles and will be in shops for Christmas. </p> <p>What these games also share is their appeal to a wider demographic than traditional video games - particularly women, who are keen on the social nature of games that take place in real space. </p> <p>\"With DDR, people who would not identify themselves as videogamers saw the value of spending $150 on a console,\" says Dr Ian Bogost, a lecturer in games studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in the US. \"They began to see the value of the games console as a device for the whole family. It's a new kind of card table for the family.\" </p> <p>Even so, Sony has taken something of a gamble with SingStar. The game retails for the price of a standard PS2 title, yet comes bundled with two microphones. There are also music publishing rights to pay for every game sold. </p> <p>Sales have been steady, but Sony insists the game is more of a slow-burner than one-hit wonder. A range of follow-up compilation discs will ensure the game has a bright future. Just don't call it karaoke.</p>",

  "<p> Ever since Darwin, we have been a nation of naturalists. About 100,000 Britons collect data on plants and animals in the wild. \"Recorders\", almost all amateurs, have logged some 60m records of bluebells, dragonflies and the other 60,000-odd species thought to be native to the British Isles. </p> <p>Dr James Munford, programme director of the National Biodiversity Trust, is trying to persuade these enthusiasts to share their work. The biodiversity network's principal tool is a website, NBN Gateway. It allows anyone to search for records of any species, by scientific or colloquial name, or to select an area of Britain and find out which species have been recorded there. Could there be grass snakes in your garden? The site will tell you whether one has been recorded within 10km. </p> <p>It won't tell you the exact grid reference, however. Such information can be highly sensitive, says Munford. Most nature recorders have strong feelings about what's done with their data: \"They don't necessarily want to disclose the exact location of a rare or threatened species.\" Wildlife data can also have enormous legal significance, for protecting habitats under international convention and prosecuting offenders. </p> <p>The solution is to give data owners control over how records are viewed. Mostly, this is done by reducing the level of accuracy. Recorders, equipped with global positioning system (GPS) satellite receivers, usually log their sightings to an accuracy of 100m. This is how it goes on to the network, and can be viewed by authorised users. However, if data owners wish, they can degrade the resolution to a 10km square, rendering the information useless to egg-collectors and such-like. </p> <p>So far, the network, which is a partnership between public agencies and voluntary groups, has received about 15m species records. These have mainly been assembled by digitising existing collections going back over decades. As a result, the site can show a timeline of records where a species was once spotted, but is now no longer found. </p> <p>Historical continuity is vital. The gateway can display data according to the 112 British \"vice counties\" of similar sizes, devised in 1852 to represent the distribution of plants, and used by naturalists ever since. Vice county boundaries, originally hand-drawn, have been transferred to modern digitised maps of much greater accuracy, sticking exactly to the original lines. This ensures that successive generations of naturalists know they are talking about the same places. </p> <p>Technically, the NBN Gateway consists of a data repository between individual data collections and the web front end. The repository, hosted at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Monkswood in Huntingdon, runs an SQL database. Two key pieces of software are ArcIMS (a geographical information system) and ArcSDE (a special database engine), both from ESRI, an IT company. The site costs about \u00a3250,000 a year to develop and run, including staff wages. It is funded by the Na tional Biodiversity Network Trust, a charitable company that raises most of its money from subscriptions. </p> <p>Every month, more than 100,000 records go into the repository. Until now, the site has been publicised only among enthusiasts. \"We now have got critical mass and we're ready to expose it to a larger and more critical audience,\" says Munford. However, he admits that more needs to be done to persuade recorders to share their data. For many, he hopes that seeing the data put to good scientific use will be reward enough. Some records have gone on the site within 10 days. The speed is up to the local process of verifying and validating a record. </p> <p>On its own, the network has increased the amount of global biodiversity information available by 50%. The largest data set in the world is of UK vascular plants, with 9.5m records. But although Britain's biology is the most studied in the world, records have been collected of only 15% of its species. </p> <p>In fact, no definitive list of species is yet available, says Charles Hussey, science data coordinator at the Natural History Museum in London. Creating a species dictionary is the goal of another biodiversity network website, hosted by the museum. \"There are around 60,000 species in Britain and around 300,000 names,\" says Hussey. These include mis-spellings, names that have changed and species that have been aggregated. </p> <p>The bluebell, for example, has had three Latin names over the years: on top of that, the plant known in Scotland as the bluebell comes from a completely different family and is known elsewhere in Britain as a harebell. The dictionary will resolve these confusions. \"To complete it is do-able,\" says Hussey, \"but it's never going to be finished. To know what's found in the British Isles you have to go and look.\" </p> <p>For less obsessive wildlife lovers, another free Natural History Museum website, Nature Navigator, presents information aimed at children and gardeners. It lists the common and scientific names of 8,000 species, with paintings and drawings from the museum's collection. Enough to keep most suburban Darwins busy. </p> <p><strong> NBN Gateway</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.searchnbn.net\">www.searchnbn.net</a> </p> <p><strong>Species dictionary</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nbn\">www.nhm.ac.uk/nbn</a> </p> <p><strong>Nature Navigator</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/naturenavigator/  \">www.nhm.ac.uk/naturenavigator</a></p>",

Lumison's service covers more than 10,000 Wi-Fi hotspots across the UK, Europe, North America, Australia and Asia.  <a href=\"http://www.lumison.net\">www.lumison.net</a> </p> <p><strong> Crystal clear</strong><br> Liquid crystal technology will almost double its colour range following a breakthrough that brings cinematic standards to the LCD screen. Israeli firm Genoa Color Technologies and Holland's Royal Philips Electronics have developed a way to add secondary colours to the primary red, green and blue of RGB. This increases the range of possible colours from 55% of the visible spectrum to 95%, promising more vibrant and brighter images. Genoa will start shipping its multi-primary colour (MPC) chips towards the end of this year, and Philips plans to use the technology in its LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon) display screens.  <a href=\"http://www.genoacolor.com\">www.genoacolor.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Bionic antispam</strong><br> IBM Research is refining its spam filters in a combined product called SpamGuru. The antispam software adds a bioinformatic technique to the standard methods of detection - commonly used words, known message variations and address analysis. Chung Kwei, the new technology in SpamGuru, borrows from DNA matching principals to detect patterns in email style to produce a \"spamminess\" rating. IBM claims SpamGuru can detect up to 97% of unwanted messages with a very low rate of false positives. A prototype of the software is available under the name of Intelligent Mail Filter in Lotus Workplace 2.0, IBM's messaging and collaboration package.  <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/spam/filtering.html\">http://www.research.ibm.com/spam/filtering.html</a> </p> <p><strong> Blueprint</strong><br> The Society of Information Technology Management is distributing a report to help local authorities fulfil the requirements of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) e-government initiative.

  "China's leaders have raised the alarm about their country's ability to feed itself as rapid development sucks land, water and people from the food-producing countryside into increasingly large and hungry cities. <p>After a steady fall in grain harvests, the world's most populous nation recently became a net importer of food for the first time in its history, raising domestic political concerns and driving up international prices of wheat, rice and soya. </p> <p>Hu Jintao, the president, has commissioned studies on food security. The prime minister, Wen Jiabao, has visited a farm to urge peasants to boost production with a warning that grain security is a matter of social stability. Ministers have hurriedly cancelled plans to develop farmland and the agricultural ministry is offering tax incentives to farmers who switch to grain production. </p> <p>Food security is a visceral issue for a generation that grew up during the famines of the 40s and 50s, when an estimated 40 million people died of starvation largely as a result of the headlong charge towards industrialisation known as the Great Leap Forward. </p> <p>Although China's hefty foreign exchange reserves make it unlikely that there will be another famine any time soon, elderly leaders have watched with concern as the country's agricultural surplus has disappeared just as the appetites of its increasingly affluent population has grown. </p> <p>During Mao Zedong's era, every local district was supposed to be self-sufficient in grain, which often necessitated diversion of scarce water resources into arid areas. Now, however, the priority for the water and the land is industrial and urban development. </p> <p>With economic zones opening up across the country and more than 10 million peasants moving into cities every year, the amount of arable land in China has shrunk by 6.7m hectares (16.75m acres) since 1996. </p> <p>According to Lin Yueqin, an economic researcher at the China Social Science Academy, the growth of cities is largely to blame for last year's record drop in grain supply. </p> <p>\"Urbanisation has eaten into the size of the nation's arable land. Farmers feel there is little profit to be had from their traditional crops so we've seen a long decline in grain output,\" he said. </p> <p>Since 1998's record harvest of 512m tonnes, grain production has fallen every year to just over 400m tonnes. </p> <p>At the same time, appetites are growing. The 9% annual growth of the economy is pushing up wages and pushing out waistlines. Urbanites are more likely to eat meat - which is fattened on grain - and they are more likely to be fat. According to one study of children in Shanghai, 8% of three- to six-year-olds are obese. </p> <p>To feed this increasingly hungry population, China has had to look overseas. In the first six months of the year, the value of food imports surged 62% to $14.4bn (\u00a38bn). Although the harvest may improve this year, it is thought unlikely to be enough to match rising demand. Soyabean imports, which doubled last year to 20.3m tonnes, are expected to double again this year. The World Bank forecasts a rise in net grain imports from 14m tonnes next year to 32m tonnes in 2020. </p> <p>Even rice - the traditional staple - is more likely to come from neighbouring countries. Such is the demand that Thai farmers report entire crops being bought long before har vests. Vietnamese authories blame food-smuggling for a record 20% increase in the price of rice. For the first time, Pakistan is being approached as a rice supplier. In one novel experiment, the Chongqing municipal government is leasing land in Laos to grow food for its urban population. </p> <p>This has lead to a surge in global food prices. Grain futures are up 30% this year thanks largely to the China factor. </p> <p>Although Beijing's leaders are concerned that the growing dependence on imports - particularly grain from the US, Canada and Australia - is a strategic vulnerability, many economists argue that it makes sense to import because China must feed 20% of the world's population with only 7% of the planet's arable land. </p> <p>China can also afford more imported food than in the past. Thanks to a booming manufacturing sector, the country has healthy foreign exchange reserves of $470bn. Most farmers would rather produce high-value, labour-intensive export crops like fruit and mushrooms than wheat and barley, which can be produced more cheaply in the US.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday August 31 2004</strong></p> <p>In the article below, we reported GlaxoSmithKline as saying that \"animal rights extremism is not a factor in its decision to go to Singapore, and the unit is not shipping out the experiments carried out on monkeys and apes that attract the most outrage from anti-vivisection groups\". Glaxo does not use apes in medical research anywhere in the world. </p> <p></p> <p>Many countries, including Britain, aspire to attract pharmaceutical companies to carry out research on their home turf. Western governments are keen to create a highly skilled workforce as a competitive edge against the cheap labour in the far east. </p> <p>Now Singapore is making inroads into this sector. Its weapon is 3bn Singapore dollars (\u00a31bn) of government cash, which is being used to make the country biotech-friendly in the five years ending in 2005. The country is close to signing a deal with UK drugs group GlaxoSmithKline to set up a research house that will investigate drugs for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. </p> <p>The number of scientists Glaxo is hiring is small relative to its British operations: about 30, compared with its estimated 6,000 in the UK. But the area of research is highly skilled and just the sort of investment Britain cannot afford to lose if it is to keep its global number two position in biomedical research and pharmaceuticals. </p> <p>Pharmaceuticals firms have been manufacturing drugs in Singapore since the early 70s, when Beecham set up a factory to make antibiotics, primarily for the Japanese market. Others soon followed, attracted by the 0% corporation tax that manufacturers are offered as well as the fact that English is the first language. Growth in healthcare manufacturing output grew 16% last year to S$11bn and the country plans to get this up to S$20bn by the end of the decade. </p> <p>Now it wants to attract the highly skilled research that the UK and US excel at, and has succeeded in luring Glaxo, Swiss firm Novartis as well as small British and American biotechnology companies. Top scientists such as Alan Colman, who led the team that brought us Dolly the cloned sheep, and Martin Hibberd at Imperial College are relocating. The country is trying to create a new force in international biomedical research. </p> <p>\"It is an effort by Singapore to add a new growth area to the economy and complement manufacturing,\" said Dr Beh Swan Gin, director of biomedical sciences for the economic development board. \"Biotechnology represents the knowledge-based economy. The initiative is fundamentally about diversifying [the country's] portfolio.\" </p> <p>So far, it has persuaded a dozen or so biomedical sciences firms to set up research operations there, including Paradigm Therapeutics from the UK and US firms Isis Pharmaceutical and Vanda Pharmaceuticals. </p> <p>\"Singapore is increasingly becoming a country of excellence in biomedical research, it makes sense tto research out there,\" said a Glaxo spokesperson. \"We want to be part of what is happening in Singapore in terms of bioscience.\" According to the Singapore government, Glaxo intends to double its laboratory space for early stage drug development. </p> <p><strong> Violent activists</strong></p> <p> To drugs research firms, a significant attraction of Singapore when compared to the UK is its strict law and ruthless policing. The pharmaceutical industry in Britain is under threat from violent animal rights activists and a \"tendency to blow up scientists\", as Paul Herrling, the chairman of Novartis's new research unit in Singapore that will look at new treatments for dengue fever and tuberculosis, puts it. </p> <p>Glaxo says that animal rights extremism is not a factor in its decision to go to Singapore, and the unit is not shipping out the experiments carried out on monkeys and apes that attract the most outrage from anti-vivisection groups. </p> <p>The main attraction is hard cash. Companies in the hi-tech sectors do not have to pay any corporation tax. And when research is loss-making, the Singapore government will match every pound spent with 50p in research grants - no strings attached. </p> <p>It has also set up a S$1bn venture capital fund under which the government will take a shareholding in the company in return for a cash injection, although this is most attractive to smaller biotechnology firms. </p> <p>One of the downsides for companies was the small number of trained scientists in Singapore. So the government is funding 1,000 extra students to do PhDs either at home or abroad. It has built a brand new science park called Biopolis, where the country's academic researchers are now housed and biotechnology companies are encouraged to rent office space, so that the private and public sector can interact. </p> <p>The fact there are fewer workers' rights also makes the country more attractive. As one service industry worker in Singapore remarked, \"in Europe you have human rights, here we are machines\". </p> <p>Staff costs can be up to 25% lower than in Britain, according to Mark Carlton, chief executive of UK drug discovery firm Paradigm Therapeutics, which has opened a research facility in Singapore. \"That makes it very favourable: you have a highly motivated workforce all being retrained in the biotech area,\" he says. \"They live to work, basically.\" </p> <p>Singapore has also made its rules and regulations attractive. The pharmaceuticals industry tests its potential products on large numbers of animals before it tries them out on humans. </p> <p>The country has developed streamlined rules and regulations which are not as bureaucratic as those in Europe. It has also taken advantage of what is in effect a ban on stem cell research in America by signing a deal with the US-based Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International to carry out such studies in the island state. </p> <p>Although Singapore has made some fast leaps in the industry, it is far from reaching the status of western Europe and the US. But could it one day rival the west to be an industry leader? \"It depends how the Chinese market develops,\" said Paradigm's Mr Carlton. \"Singapore is a springboard into Japan and Asia, and everyone is watching what's going on in China with great anticipation - it will be a great new outlet for drugs being developed. </p> <p>\"Singapore is a very easy nation in which to work, it is very stable, etcetera. We will have to see how the industry matures, but I see no reason why it won't be highly competitive.\" </p> <p>Singapore insists that it is not trying to steal the industry from the west. \"We only need a very small slice of the pie,\" said Dr Beh. \"We want to play a complementary role, and be part of the international community. The west will always remain very important research centres.\"</p>",

Andrejus Zadneprovskis of Lithuania finished second, while Libor Capalini of the Czech Republic claimed bronze.

At least we know how to knock out a good tune.\" </p> <p><strong>1643</strong> Germany still lead Sweden 1-0 with five minutes of the first half of the women's bronze-medal footie playoff to go.</p> <p>\"In defence of Catherine Sergeant,\" writes David Bain, \"she never said that the Welsh were marvellous at sports, just that she enjoyed knocking the Scots. Being married to a half Welsh person, I have to remind my children that they are a quarter Welsh, and that if they fall below the standards that I expect from them, then at least they could play sport for Wales - in later years I'm hoping that their response would be that at least they won't have to represent Scotland.\"</p> <p><strong>1639</strong> The men's modern pentathlon has been won by the Russian Andrei Moiseev.</p> <p>\"Perhaps Alan Sprang should reconsider the relative strengths of Welsh and Scottish sport this century - i.e. the past four years,\" writes Jack Whibley. \"A resurgent Welsh football and rugby team have been 'matched' by a dearth of talent from North of the border.\"</p> <p><strong>1632</strong> Lithuania are through to the men's basketball semi-finals after a 95-75 win over China.</p> <p>\"If you win a relay, you're a relay gold-medallist,\" explains Niall McDonagh. \"If you win the 100m or 200m (or 400m ?), you are a sprint gold medallist.

To be fair, the keeper made a bit of a hash of it. I expect she'll be as sick as a parrot.</p> <p>\"Call me petty\" says Ben Roome of himself, \"but I believe that you are a sprint gold medallist if you win a gold in the sprint relay. Steve Carter was correct after all.\" </p> <p><strong>1616</strong> \"In the interests of putting one over our former colony can I suggest the sports of swimming and cycling be removed from the Olympics?\" writes David Holme. \"Nobody would really miss them and then we would be ahead of Australia in the medal table with five as opposed to three.\"</p> <p><strong>1613</strong> Britain's Hannah McKibbin finished 21st out of 24 in the qualification round for the rhythmic gymnastics. I'm guessing that means we won't be seeing too much more of her.</p> <p>\"Interestingly, or maybe not, Paul Dickinson is also the name of the beeb athletics commentator who was likened, quite correctly in my view, to Alan Partridge by one of your contributors the other day,\" writes Paul Robson. \"Maybe that explains why Paul Dickinson doesn't know that the semi-final losers in boxing get a bronze?\"</p> <p> <strong>1608</strong> \"Steve Carter,\" writes Niall McDonagh. \"Allow me to be even more petty-minded. Charlie Greene was a relay gold medallist, not a sprint gold medallist (bronze in the 100m, I believe).\" You learn something new every email. </p> <p><strong>1606</strong> \"Why does Matt 'Braveheart' Warner assume that you have to be English to be denigrating the Scots sporting efforts?\" asks Catherine Sergeant. \"I'm Welsh and I think they're rubbish as well. Besides, this partisan sniping isn't really in the great Olympic spirit is it.\"</p> <p><strong>1559</strong> USA have won the bronze medal playoff in the women's water polo, beating Australia 6-5.</p> <p>\"No one in the pub or work (the only two places I ever seem to find myself) can work out how Amir Khan's guaranteed a medal when he's in the semi-final,\" writes Paul Dickinson. \"Surely there's another guy in with a shout, or is the medal awarding as dodgy as the judging at the gymnastics?\" The losing semi-finalists in the boxing automatically get a bronze, Paul. They don't bother with a third/fourth-place playoff, presumably to spare the boxers any more damage than is strictly necessary. </p> <p><strong>1543</strong> \"Call me petty minded,\" writes Steve Carter, \"but Simon Whawell's attribution of the description of sunglasses as 're-entry shields' to Ed Moses has been bugging me. So I checked up and it goes back to Charlie Greene, US sprint gold medallist in Mexico (1968). Surely the great Moses didn't need to resort to such affectations.\"</p> <p> <strong>1535</strong> In the Star class, Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell have dropped back to seventh overall after finishing seventh and 17th (or last) in today's two races. They are almost 20 points adrift of the Canadians, who currently occupy the bronze medal position.</p> <p><strong>1531</strong> Britain's Leigh McMillan and Mark Bulkeley have finished 15th and 16th in today's two races in the Tornado (multi-hull) class. That leaves them in 13th overall after 10 races.</p> <p><strong>1529</strong> The final of the women's under-49kg class in the tae kwon-do will be between (minor drum roll) Yanelis Yuliet Labrada Diaz of Cuba and Chen Shih-Hsin of Taiwan, who thus have finalists in the both the women's and the men's competitions. </p> <p>\"Richard Burgess was totally right,\" says Ian Bruff. \"Mizuki Noguchi ran a brilliant race in the women's marathon. She was the only one who wasn't intimidated by the course or the conditions, and that 5k when she destroyed them all up the hill was awesome. On a different point, I've been spending so much time watching the Olympics that today was the first time I've left the house since Saturday. 0km sitting, anyone?\"</p> <p> <strong>1524</strong> Matt Warner is one of several Scots to take exception to my admittedly weak gag about a Scot qualifiying for an Olympic final in the form of the assistant referee in Saturday's football. Let me make oe thing clear: I was not for a moment suggesting that he was the <em>only</em> Scot to have made it to a final. Merely that he is <em>a</em> Scot. I hope this heads other angry rants off at the pass.</p> <p>Anyway, here's the angry bit of Matt's email. \"i'm sure that your little bit of xenophobia (a scot has made it to an olympic final.... as a referee!) was merely a glitch in your otherwise fine minute-by-minute commentary...... have to point out that one of the first golds won by team GB (argggghhhh) was chris hoy in the cycling velodrome. and in olympic record time as well. shall we point out all the english olympic failures now or would that be petty?\" </p> <p><strong>1520</strong> \"I'm so glad the US basketball are still in the competition,\" writes Joe Waters without even a hint of sarcasm. \"Watching them attempt to out do each other with ever more strange arrangements of headbands, sweatbands, oversized shorts and other sports accessories is an entertainment itself. The main contenders are the captain, Iverson who specialises in supports and sports a large tubi-grip on one arm, a small elbow support on the other and a rather natty finger protector on one hand. His main rival, number 11 (not sure of his name as me and my girlfriend call him Pudsey after the Children in Need mascot), wears a more understated headband which he constantly arranges to make sure its jaunty angle is maintained. Shame I missed the actual game with this Email!\" How long did it take you to write, Joe?</p> <p><strong>1516</strong> \"I haven't quite managed 100m this year,\" responds Mostyn Lewis. \"Furthest was approx 57m to get a taxi at three in the morning (in a surprisingly quick time). Fail to see what it has to do with the Olympics though.\" </p> <p><strong>1515</strong> \"Has the women's pentathlon been and gone?\" asks John Leach. \"Must have been dreaming this morning as I have a distinct memory of a quick report in the updates.\" You did read it, John, but it was an error. The women go tomorrow, when we have a very real chance of a medal. There are no Brits in the men's, which is taking place today.</p> <p><strong>1513</strong> \"I think what Tom Hopkins means is that it is impossible to absorb more then one litre of water an hour,\" writes Anton Lawrence. \"And he's right.\"</p> <p> <strong>1511</strong> There's not a lot going on in Athens right now. If there is, I don't know about it. </p> <p>\"What about this continuing and ridiculous trend of athletes wearing sunglasses, even at night - no wonder they run into hurdles etc.\" reckons Simon Whawell. \"Only the great Ed \"they're not sun glasses, they're re-entry shields\" Moses can get away with this.\"</p> <p><strong>1508</strong> \"Did anyone notice how none of the other athletes congratulated the Greek girl after she won gold in 400m hurdles,\" asks Joe Cosgrove. \"This was picked up by RTE (the Irish broadcaster) but the Beeb made no comment.

Blanco will meet Mu Yen Chu of Taiwan in the final.</p> <p>\"Can Chris Maiden's pint-sinkers run long distances?\" wonders Jim McKenna. \"If so here's the answer to the marathon problem.\" </p> <p><strong>1459</strong> The swimming is under way in the men's pentathlon - the third event of, er, five.</p> <p>\"Blimey,\" writes John McClure. \"What's Mostyn's best time for the 100 this year then?\"</p> <p><strong>1455</strong> \"So who beat the saintly Matthew?\" asks Alan Knox. \"Some drug-stuffed Greek?\" Alas no, Alan. It was Jan Zelezny, the Czech Republic's three-time Olympic champion who had originally ceded his place to Pinsent in 2001 to concentrate on his training. But Zelezny is now back on the IOC after some election in Athens.</p> <p><strong>1452</strong> Mu Yen Chu of Taiwan is through to the final of the men's 58kg tae kwon-do after a 5-4 win over Tamer Bayoumi of Egypt.</p> <p>\"Rob Mansfield is so right,\" fawns Luke Satchell. \"The wisdom of Top Tips should never be questioned.

Yes, Martin Cryans will be an assistant referee in Saturday's football showdown between Argentina and Paraguay.</p> <p>Chris Maiden is challenging Tom Hopkins's claim that 'it is almost impossible to drink more than one litre per hour'. \"Total rubbish,\" he thunders. \"One litre is one-and-three-quarter pints. I know people who can drink two pints in about 10 seconds.\"</p> <p><strong>1443</strong> Bad news - at last - for Matthew Pinsent, who has lost his place on the International Olympic Committee. I don't think this means an awful lot in practice, but it will doubtless be described as a major blow to London's already pitiful hopes of staging the 2012 games.</p> <p>\"There's something peculiarly amusing about the Tae Kwon-do as they bounce incessantly up and down, only pausing to occasionally pull up their trousers,\" notes Patrick Samphire. \"It's not exactly the Karate Kid, is it?\"</p> <p> <strong>1440</strong> \"Standing on a pillow?\" alaughs Rob Mansfield. \"Well, It's obvious, isn't it? Er, actually, I don't know for sure - it was just one of our fave top tips from \"Best\" a few years back. I think it's something to do with softening your rigid stance at the ironing board. Sadly, I did actually try it and, guess what, it works? Just remember, though, don't question the Law of Top Tips!\"</p> <p><strong>1435</strong> Paul Green, incidentally, still has a chance of a bronze in the tae kwon-do after his quarter-final defeat because he is now in the repechage. More of which later.</p> <p>Here, meanwhile, is the answer to Mostyn's teaser: \"Little-known Americans who (in addition to Justin Gatlin, Maurice Greene, Shawn Crawford, John Capel, Coby Miller, Bernard Williams and Tim Montgomery) have run faster than any British athlete over 100m in 2004. That's 14 Americans before the first Brit and it's a similar story over 200m. As Michael Johnson said, British athletes think they are stars when in reality they are mediocre at best. And please don't start me off on Darren Campbell's hamstring \"injury\". Pathetic.\"</p> <p><strong>1433</strong> \"A little question for you,\" writes Mostyn Lewis. \"Who are Leonard Scott, Mickey Grimes, Tyson Gay, Marcus Brunson, Mardy Scales, Joshua Johnson and Tyree Gailes?\" I'll provide the answer in the next bulletin. Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.</p> <p><strong>1430</strong> \"In response to Paul Brown,\" writes Tom Hopkins, \"then the estimate I heard was that under those conditions you lose three litres of fluid an hour, whereas it is almost impossible to drink more than one litre per hour, so (the radiant) Paula could have drunk enough to make herself sick and she still would have been chronically dehydrated. And I still think that organising a sporting event in conditions which results in competitors needing to go on a drip is grossly irresponsible.\" Amen.</p> <p><strong>1427</strong> After that thrilling defeat for Spain by USA in the quarter-finals of the men's basketball, Paul Lofthouse offers another perspective. \"I was listening to Spanish radio commentary on the game and I can tell you they were disgusted by the refereeing. Virtually not a single personal foul has been awarded to the Europeans. Lots of talk of conspiracies, Mexican referees etc.\"</p> <p><strong>1426</strong> Green is out of the tae kwon-do. He lost 4-2 to Quoc Huan Nguyen of Vietnam. Bah.</p> <p><strong>1425</strong> Paul Green is currently competing in the quarter-final of the tae kwon-do. He was trailing 2-0 to his Vietnamese opponent, but he's just made it 2-2 with a beautiful swivel kick of some description.</p> <p><strong>1423</strong> \"Can you ask Rob Mansfield how come standing on a pillow whilst ironing makes it easier/\" asks a confused Clare Storrow. Well? </p> <p><strong>1420</strong> Lawrence here again, hence the reversion to the 24-hour clock.</p> <p><strong>2.16pm</strong> The Americans go through with a 102-94 victory, and it's a little harsh on Spain who would probably have progressed through any other quarter final. Right, that's it from me I'm afraid, there's some lunch to be had. Mr Booth will be back to keep you abreast of developments shortly.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> It's virtually all over by the looks of things... one minute left and they're nine points off the pace - and getting scrappy now, too. 95-86.</p> <p>\"Paula Radcliffe should turn up in civvies and hang around the stadium pretending not to be bothered, give an interview saying she isn't going to run followed by a nonchalant stroll to the start ostensibly to wish the others luck and then just before the start reveal that she's got her running clobber on underneath and join in,\" says Andrew Goldsby. \"Works in American Wrestling every time.\" </p> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> Two minutes to go, and Spain are only five behind now, with 86 to America's 91. </p> <p>\"During the swimming Sharron Davies said that Ian Thorpe was twice as big a global star as David Beckham, was this just typical commentator's hyperbole trying to over hype their own sport, or is their a grain of truth in this?\" You even have to ask, Harry Dolby? Even Emile Heskey gets complimented by his interviewers.</p> <p><strong>2.03pm</strong> The men in charge of this game have completely lost control - bad decisions are queuing up in this quarter and it's costing the Spanish, who are now 87-78 down.</p> <p>\"Do you know what I can't stand about the BBC coverage? Gary Richardson. I'm usually pretty mild-mannered but his inane, sychophantic interview style makes me want to snap a whole box of pencils in half... ONE ... BY ...

Spain are still looking good though, and as I like to tell myself on the treadmill, eight minutes is a long long time.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Things are hotting up again, the Spaniards on 67, USA 74 as we head into the third break. I'm hoping Eurosport will spice up the break by sending Gunnell into the arena to ask how everyone's feeling before smiling inanely for the next five minutes.</p> <p>David Slovak wants to know what Paula Radcliffe's doing about the 10k, but the honest answer is we don't know more than you, and we probably won't until tomorrow - her names in the hat, but she won't decide until the last moment.</p>",
  "<p>Martin Sorrell's WPP has emerged as a likely bidder for Moving Picture Company, the Soho special effects company ITV is selling as part of its \u00a3550m disposal of non-core assets.</p> <p>The global advertising group is among around a dozen buyers looking seriously at the business. These include the former Carlton chairman Michael Green, French electronics group Thomson Technicolor and UK entertainment company Ran.</p> <p>WPP is understood to be keen to add a commercials and feature film company to its existing post-production businesses Metro Group and The Farm Group, which mainly provide services to broadcasters and production companies.</p> <p>ITV is understood to have sent out prospectuses to around two dozen interested parties, although it expects only around half of these will pursue a bid.</p> <p>Bids are expected to value the business at substantially more than analysts' initial estimates of \u00a325m.</p> <p>Last year the company posted sales of over \u00a330m, buoyed by its work on feature films such as Troy and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It also produces commercials for the likes of Nike, Adidas and Stella Artois.</p> <p>Interest from companies such as Technicolor, itself owned by Carlton before it was sold off to French electronics group Thomson four years ago, and Rank, which is looking to add MPC to its film-to-packaging subsidiary Deluxe, could also push up prices.

  "Mark Thatcher is not the only scion of a European political dynasty to be dogged by accusations that he tried to profit from African oil. <p>Four years ago, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, the son of France's former president, was arrested on charges of helping to traffic hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of Russian arms to Angola in the mid-1990s, when the country was in the grip of a brutal and protracted civil war.</p> <p>He was released in January 2001 after his mother, Danielle Mitterrand, raised five million francs (roughly \u00a3500,000) in bail - a sum she angrily referred to as a \"ransom\" - and the French court dropped its investigation a few months later on a legal technicality.</p> <p>But \"Angolagate\" is still under investigation. Mr Mitterrand was arrested again in June this year and questioned about a fish-processing business he set up in Mauritania. Judge Philippe Courroye, who Mr Mitterrand accuses of conducting a vendetta against him and trying to sully the name of his family, suspects the factory may have provided a cover for money laundering. Mr Mitterrand insists he was simply trying to revive Mauritania's economy.</p> <p>While Mark Thatcher was accused of trading on his family name and connections on several occasions - allegations he and his mother always denied - Mr Mitterrand enjoyed an official role in his father's administration as an envoy to Africa. The French media even gave him the nickname \"Papa m'a dit\" (Daddy told me). It was in Angola that he fostered the contacts that, it was alleged, he later used to organise arms shipments to the country's government.</p> <p>According to All the President's Men, a 2002 report by Global Witness, a group which examines links between natural resources and human rights abuses, the Mitterrand government was looking for a way to put an end to the civil war in Angola, where the rebel group Unita had gained the upper hand. President Mitterrand was also keen to avoid the US - which had recently stopped funding Unita - gaining an advantage in any future negotiations for oil deals in Angola.</p> <p>The sympathies of the French defence minister, however, lay with Unita, making it virtually impossible for the president to intervene formally. Instead, Global Witness suggests, Jean-Christophe was deployed to \"engineer a solution\" by channelling arms exports via Brenco International, a company run by a French businessman called Pierre Falcone and headquartered in Paris.</p> <p>Mr Mitterrand admits that he worked with Mr Falcone on \"pre-financing\" - raising loans for Angola against future oil production - for which he would expect to receive a modest commission, anything between 100 and 10,000 francs. \"I never heard [Mr Falcone] talk about weapons,\" he told the French radio station RTL.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the president's son continues to accuse the French judiciary of targeting him unfairly because of his family name. His bank accounts have been frozen since 2000.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">Global Witness</a></p>",
  "The US president, George Bush, and his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, are running virtually neck and neck in the race for the White House, pollsters said today. <p>The bipartisan <a href=\"http://www.tarrance.com/battleground.html\">Battleground Poll</a> found 48% of respondents backing Mr Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, while 47% supported Mr Bush and the vice-president, Dick Cheney; 3% favoured the independents Ralph Nader and Peter Camejo. </p> <p>Because of the deadlock both sides needed to focus on maintaining existing support and making sure voters turned out for elections, pollsters said. </p> <p>However, Mr Kerry already appears to have solidified support among some of the groups crucial to his chances of victory in November, such as black voters and union members. </p> <p>His ratings showed a little movement after the Democratic National Convention last month in Boston, gaining slightly in some polls.</p> <p>Among these was the recent <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/\">Zogby International poll</a>, which had him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1291085,00.html\">edging ahead</a> of Mr Bush in key swing states. </p> <p>But the fight is as much about hanging on to support as winning new voters. The Battleground Poll, sponsored by George Washington University, found 84% of voters saying they had already made a definite choice for president. That compared with 64% at a comparable time in the late summer of 2000, before the last presidential elections.</p> <p>Mr Bush will be attempting to influence the electorate at the Republican National Convention next week in New York.</p> <p>However, pollsters Ed Goeas, a Republican, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, who worked together on the Battleground Poll, said the convention was unlikely to conjure up significant new support. </p> <p>Mr Goeas said: \"Realistically the Bush campaign should expect little or no bounce ... because of the polarised political environment.\"</p> <p>Ms Lake said: \"There's nobody left to bounce... The undecided voters, who tend to be female and non-college, will decide late.\" </p> <p>A key priority for Mr Bush after the convention will be to regain the advantage in his \"intensity of support\", according to Mr Goeas. </p> <p>The poll found that evangelical Christians, a Republican-leaning group, had been contacted by campaign workers at a higher rate than black and Hispanic people, who tend to lean toward the Democrats. Ms Lake said that meant Democrats would need to push hard to match the Republican outreach. </p> <p>However, a poll yesterday in the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\">Los Angeles Times</a> put Mr Bush ahead of Mr Kerry for the first time this year, with 49% of registered voters favouring Mr Bush against 46% for Mr Kerry. </p> <p>The survey indicated that attacks on Mr Kerry over his Vietnam service record had hurt him, the LA Times said. </p> <p>The Battleground Poll and the Los Angeles Times each contacted around 1,000 voters last week and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3% points.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life before</strong><br></p> <p>If it boasts \"new features\" or \"latest technology\" or \"upgraded\" on the packaging, then tear me away at your peril. And if it wasn't for the fact that Jane constantly reminds me that we have a mortgage to pay and a child to feed, then I fear much more of our disposable income would be funnelled into my gadget habit.</p> <p>A bad gadget habit is usually fuelled by an above-average interest in music and/or films, and I'm afraid I am guilty on both counts. We have a widescreen TV, a DVD player, CD players in three rooms, radios in two more, and a master hi-fi system. I also have an iPod personal music player and an iPaq pocket PC, both of which require a home computer to operate.</p> <p>This all adds up to two things: between the pair of us, we seem to be keeping the makers of four-gang extension cables in business and, given that we also both work on computers, we spend an awful lot of time looking at screens.</p> <p><strong> The ethical audit</strong><br></p> <p>The auditors: <strong> Hannah Berry</strong>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <strong> Mike Childs</strong>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <strong> Renee Elliott</strong>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>As the auditors step into our sitting room, Mike immediately comments on the size of our television. \"You evidently like electrical goods,\" he says. \"You have a massive new television and a good sprinkling of other electrical items around the house. Since your baby has arrived, I suspect you have been spending a lot more time at home, so your electrical home entertainment suite is now probably very well used.\"</p> <p>\"One of the major concerns about the electronics sector for me,\" says Hannah, \"is the number of companies devoting major resources to lobbying for the free-trade neo-liberal agenda - typified by Gatt, Nafta and the like - and against attempts to make the industry more accountable for its social and environmental impacts. It is an industry characterised by short-term thinking, intentional rapid obsolescence and little regard for worker health and safety, union rights or the environment.\"</p> <p>Hannah adds that many electronics companies contract out labour to sweatshop-style factories. Workers are therefore commonly found to have health problems including cancer, miscarriages and birth defects. She says that a Mexican economist has commented that tripling wages to just $2 an hour for workers in the \"maquiladoras\" (Mexican assembly plants generally owned by non-Mexican corporations exporting to the US) would vastly improve living standards.</p> <p>Jane and I are somewhat stunned at this. Mike then raises the issue of our gadgets' impact on the environment. \"Televisions and computer monitors pose a particular disposal problem because the cathode-ray monitors contain lead oxide and barium, which means they will soon be classified as hazardous waste. The good news is that a new European directive means producers will have to organise free take-back for a range of appliances including televisions, toasters and washing machines. This is important, as some 120,000 tonnes of glass from television cathode-ray tubes alone are scrapped in the UK every year. Some 15m mobile phone handsets are replaced each year, too.\"</p> <p>Compounding the bad news, says Mike, is the fact that our electrical goods are often treated and made with toxic materials. \"Many are treated, for example, with brominated flame-retardants, which are known to build up in the human body and affect the hormone system. Increasingly, electronic waste is being exported to developing countries for sham recycling operations, often where there is little environmental or safety protection.\"</p> <p>Hannah picks up on this too. \"Electronics is the world's largest and fastest-growing manufacturing industry, and 'e-waste' the fastest growing waste stream in the industrialised world. Manufacture itself is highly polluting, with each circuit board producing 10 times its weight in hazardous waste. The 315m computers expected to have become obsolete by the end of this year represent more than 1bn tonnes of lead, 2bn tonnes of plastic and hundreds of thousands of tonnes of other toxic materials. In the UK, around 2m TVs are discarded annually, many ending up in landfill. The lead in their cathode-ray tubes (aside from the other toxic materials such as zinc, cadmium and phosphorus) has acute and chronic effects on plants and wildlife if it leaches into groundwater.\"</p> <p>Jane asks Renee if she has anything to add as she has been quiet up to now. \"This isn't really my area, to be honest, so I asked Dan Morrell, the founder of Future Forests, the 'carbon neutral' advocates, for advice on how to reduce the negative impact of electrical goods. He said the first step was to consider the power they use. Just by turning off our TVs, stereos and DVD players properly, rather than leaving them on standby all the time, we would save between 10% and 60% of the electricity we use. Some even say that if we all did this each night we could shut off about three power stations in the UK. You should also turn off your mobile-phone recharger once the phone is charged rather than leaving it on indefinitely, otherwise 95% of a recharger's electricity consumption will be wasted.\"</p> <p>\"TV energy efficiency has been improving,\" adds Hannah, \"but the rise of digital TV is undermining this because decoders left on constant standby will increase household electricity use by 7% by 2010.\"</p> <p>What do they want us to do, we ask. Give up watching TV?</p> <p>\"Why not?\" says Mike. \"Time spent with eyes glued to the screen of your television or computer is time not spent on more fulfilling activities. Trying to avoid buying electrical goods is also an important step. Where you do need to buy them, buying the most energy-efficient model is not only better for the planet, but in the long run is better for your pocket as well. Why not invest in a wind-up radio, for a start?\"</p> <p>And make sure you recycle any old mobile phones, says Renee. \"Many people don't realise that up to 90% of a mobile phone can be recycled.</p> <p>\"Other things to remember: when buying computers, look for a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor that is compatible with all standard PCs. A 38cm LCD screen uses much less energy than a standard cathode-ray tube - typically 18 watts as opposed to about 200.\"</p> <p>LCD screens last, on average, three years longer too, adds Hannah. She also points out that we should look out for any \"eco-labels\" if buying products such as TVs as they could indicate better recyclability, fewer bio-accumulative compounds and even a free \"take-back\" scheme by the manufacturers when it reaches the end of its life.</p> <p><strong> Life after</strong><br></p> <p>\"This is going to be a real wrench\" is my first thought when Jane suggests that we follow Mike's advice and try to live without television, CD players, radios and the like. Being the bookworm of the family, Jane is keener than me. She says she relishes the tyranny of the remote controls being omitted from our lives. We decide to give it a one-week trial to begin with.</p> <p>Our experiment starts well. On the first night we eat supper after returning from work, then sit down to a game of Scrabble. Even though we argue for nearly 10 minutes about the legitimacy of the verb \"to hoover\", we notice two positive things about the evening: it seems longer without hours spent in front of the box, and we spend longer talking to each other. And that can't be a bad thing.</p> <p>It does seem odd, though, without background noise from the TV, radio or CD player. I have a real itch, for example, to switch the telly on to watch the news. But we do find ourselves getting round to doing those things that have been backing up for months, such as putting holiday photographs into albums and sorting through paperwork.</p> <p>Television is one thing, but we both find omitting CD players and radio from our lives a little pointless. We can't see the harm of music playing in the house, but we appreciate the auditors' point about the energy our gadgets use up, especially while on standby, so we make a real effort to switch everything off at night. We never quite resolve what to do with things such as the digital TV set-top box, video player and radio in the kitchen, as all of them need to be retuned when power is lost. After a few days we give up, but we do cease completely from leaving the TV and computer on standby.</p> <p>A few weeks after receiving the auditors' advice, we decide it is time to buy a new computer. We have had our old laptop for years and it is beginning to strain. We dismiss the idea of not having a PC at all, as we both need to work at home on occasion. I investigate having it upgraded, but the cost is almost twice that of a new PC, so I vow to find a computer that meets as many of the auditors' criteria as possible - namely, it is future-proof, energy-efficient, made by a firm not involved in unethical practices, and contains few toxic materials.</p> <p>I start by looking into buying a secondhand reconditioned computer, but none of the machines packs enough punch to last more than a couple of years. I write down all my computing needs - word processing, spreadsheets, internet and email, managing my iPod, printing and storing basic digital camera images. I rule out things such as games and running memory-hungry image and video packages. I therefore do not need an all-singing, all-dancing multimedia beast, rather a no-frills machine that includes a good processor, ample storage and plenty of memory. This way it should remain capable of handling most of my needs for the next few years with ease.</p> <p>Hannah says that Ethical Consumer magazine only rates a handful of manufacturers positively across its range of ethical criteria. These include Evesham, Mesh and Viglen, so I restrict myself to these brands. I am particularly keen to find a machine that boasts the TCO '99 standard, which is managed by a Swedish office workers' union and ensures that many heavy metals, brominated flame retardants and PVC are banned from computer parts, particularly monitors.</p> <p>Hannah also lists many other household names to avoid due to their involvement in unethical practices, but in an industry such as computing it seems that no one is perfect and in the end I choose a computer that just meets as many of my demands as possible. This turns out to be an Evesham with a TFT-LCD flat screen and a TCO '99 label, but in all truth there wasn't much in it other than price when compared with other firms.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leo's next report, on DIY, will appear in two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Maxwell, the son of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, was today due to appear in court in his battle to stave off a \u00a31m debt claim. </p> <p>Mr Maxwell appeared before Oxford county court in June after Global Investments Ltd sought the payment and petitioned to have him declared bankrupt for a second time. </p> <p>The claim concerns Mr Maxwell's property and financing firm Meynard Freres, to which Global Investments is a creditor.</p> <p>In court on that occasion, Mr Maxwell - who sat on the board of Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) prior to his father's death in 1991 - was given 45 days to make a payment. </p> <p>The solicitor for the creditors said he had agreed to release an asset to pay the debt in full, and bankruptcy was avoided. </p> <p>The court hearing today is a continuation of the proceedings, which Mr Maxwell says have no connection with Telemonde, the telecommunications company he set up in 1998. </p> <p>He became Britain's biggest bankrupt in 1992, with debts of \u00a3400m in the wake of the Mirror Group pension scandal that engulfed his family.</p> <p>After Robert Maxwell was found drowned, having apparently fallen from his yacht in Tenerife, a \u00a3460m black hole was discovered in the MCC pension fund. Following his death, his sons, Kevin and Ian, were investigated over an alleged conspiracy to defraud the fund. </p> <p>However, by 1995, Kevin Maxwell's bankruptcy had been discharged, and in the following year he was acquitted on criminal charges relating to allegations that he had helped his father to steal more than \u00a3120m from the Mirror pension fund. </p> <p>Last month, the companies court in London heard that a overdue payment of \u00a318,000 had been made to a creditor seeking a winding-up order against Meynard Freres.</p> <p>The winding-up petition had been sought after two cheques for \u00a318,000 bounced. The payments related to the acquisition of some assets of Midlands firm Astec Engineering Services. </p> <p>However, there remained some confusion over the position of outstanding debts of more than \u00a3300,000, owed by Meynard Freres to Global Investment. Global had sought a winding-up order earlier this year, but the application was later dismissed.</p>",

  "<p>Something very strange started to happen in the middle of the Xasax Saxophone Ensemble's performance of The Mouth, the Feet, the Sound by Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino. </p> <p>The four players were positioned at four corners of the vast atrium of Edinburgh's Royal Museum, with a 1,000-strong audience sitting all over the floor, between fishponds, and on balconies. The sounds the quartet produced were completely unlike anything associated with the conventional repertoire of the saxophone: a mist of quiet clicks and calls replaced recognisable notes, creating a mobile, indefinable musical texture. </p> <p>But then, from one end of the hall, an even weirder noise began, like a torrent of raindrops or a distant flock of birds. It was as if the building itself was responding in sympathy with the saxophone quartet, echoing and amplifying these tiny sounds, and haunting the space. </p> <p>The reason for this acoustic phenomenon was revealed in a moment of theatrical magic. Dozens of saxophonists, previously hidden off-stage, solemnly started to process through the space, flooding the hall with their own sounds, a collection of sighs and breaths. Over 130 saxophonists, each clad in all-black outfits, made a pilgrimage through the museum following a continuous, circular course around the quartet and through the audience. </p> <p>The saxophones invaded the hall with their gentle sounds and gestures until the very end of the piece, when the quartet suddenly played loud, repeated notes, abruptly silencing the chorus of saxophones. </p> <p>The Mouth, the Feet, the Sound was a bewildering piece, both musically and theatrically - more an installation or sonic environment than a conventional performance - but the Xasax's interpretation, with professional and amateur players from all over Scotland, was a unique, beguiling experience.</p>",
  "<p>The Confederation of British Industry today urged the Bank of England not to \"overdo the rate rise medicine\" as it cut its predictions for economic growth next year.</p> <p>In its quarterly economic forecast, the CBI predicted that UK GDP growth would now average 3.4% in 2004 because of changes in the way in which government sector output is measured. </p> <p>The employers' organisation expects reasonable but more moderate growth for next year, trimming its previous 3% forecast to 2.8%.</p> <p>\"That reflects a slower recovery in export growth than previously thought as rising oil prices hit demand from industrialised countries, together with a clearer moderation in UK consumer spending growth than previously projected,\" the CBI said.</p> <p>With high oil prices likely to hit world demand and rising interest rates making UK consumers less willing to spend, the director-general of the CBI, Digby Jones, urged the Bank to slacken the pace of interest rate rises and not \"overdo the rate rise medicine\".</p> <p>Mr Jones added: \"After five increases since November, this forecast suggests that, combined with the impact on demand of recent oil price rises, the prescription so far may be almost enough to do the trick.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Bank's monetary policy committee raised borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 4.75%. The Bank's August inflation report, and minutes from its interest rate decision, show analysts believe that interest rates are now approaching their peak.</p> <p>The CBI today said it believed that base interest rates would level out at 5.25% early next year. However, Mr Jones warned that the risks and uncertainties surrounding the forecast were greater than usual, saying that even this relatively low peak in base rates would be too high if global or domestic demand were to suddenly deteriorate.</p> <p>There have been signs that the US economy is losing momentum, with job growth having virtually stalled last month.</p> <p>However, the Federal Reserve still raised rates earlier this month, with its chairman, Alan Greenspan, saying the economy had hit a \"soft patch\" in June because of high oil prices.</p> <p>The CBI expects oil prices to fall from their current highs next year, but they will still be up on previous forecasts. Oil is predicted to average $36.6 (\u00a323.3) a barrel this year, and $31.3 in 2005. That compares with the $33.3 and $28.9 a barrel forecast in May.</p> <p>In a separate report, the CBI detailed an order books rebound for British manufacturers during August. The CBI's monthly industrial trends survey said manufacturers planned to raise production in the next three months, despite high oil prices and rising interest rates.</p> <p>The survey showed that 21% of firms said total order books were above normal while 19% said they were below. The balance of +2% was the highest since February 1998, well above the balance of -7 in July or economists' expectations of -5. </p> <p>\"Overall, this shows that July's dip in confidence was temporary and suggests the recovery remains intact,\" John Butler, an economist at HSBC, said. </p> <p>\"This is a stronger than expected survey, contradicting the view that growth is starting to slow and raising sufficient question marks about the outlook for future inflation.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's almost 50 years since the death of Dale Carnegie, author of the bestseller, How To Win Friends and Influence People, which introduced millions to the art of negotiation and persuasion. As I read the news of gay activist Peter Tatchell's latest publicity stunt, I felt it was time someone sent him a copy. </p> <p>Tatchell and his pressure group Outrage! are furious because reggae artists Elephant Man and Vybz Kartel have just been nominated in this year's Music of Black Origin awards. And they've every right to be: songs by these two acts contain lyrics which are violently anti-gay and which any right-minded person could only condemn. And you can add to that the fact that Buju Banton - who a decade ago rapped that gays should be shot dead - was sought in connection with a gay-bashing incident last month, and that Brian Williamson, Jamaica's most prominent gay activist, was brutally stabbed to death in June (though the motives are as yet unclear). </p> <p>The problem is, though, that if Tatchell wants to persuade these artists' fans to reject the homophobia of the Jamaican ghetto, he's using the wrong tactics entirely. </p> <p>Tatchell has waded in with a call to boycott the Mobos, and for the BBC to pull the plug on screening it - effectively a demand to put Britain's biggest black awards ceremony out of business. And this is not the first time he's acted this way. Previously he's called for other Jamaican reggae artists to be banned from Britain or face criminal charges. </p> <p>But the Mobos, and its voting academy of DJs, promoters and record industry insiders, are merely reflecting the fact that these acts are very popular; and in any case their audiences are far more interested in the bass, the beat and the rhythm than they are in the content of the lyrics. </p> <p>What Tatchell doesn't understand is that music is very important to black people. Not just in that it's something we like to listen to, but that traditionally, along with sport, it's been the only way for most of us to rise out of inner-city poverty. When Tatchell tries to drive our musicians out of business, he's cutting off our escape route. He will get a very negative reaction. </p> <p>It's easy to vilify artists who for the most part are picked up then spat out by the industry, often ending their years in the poverty from which they came. But it's a fruitless exercise, because their fans are likely to resent the attack and to jump to their heroes' defence. </p> <p>Tatchell's motives are already being called into question. Following his most prominent recent campaigns, against Robert Mugabe and the Muslim cleric Sheikh al-Qaradawi, some are beginning to ask what he's got against people of colour. Tatchell argued recently that the Mugabe regime was \"worse than apartheid\", an astonishing denial of one of the world's worst-ever suppression machines. And he had the cheek last month to accuse the Jamaican prime minister of having a \"slave mentality\". Yes, massa. </p> <p>Whether it's Africa, the Caribbean or the Middle East, it is undeniable that many cultures are more conservative than those of western Europe. Many of these views have their breeding ground in poverty and lack of opportunity (Tatchell could also try talking to Britain's own working classes to see how right-on they are). </p> <p>And before condemning other parts of the world, and their people, Tatchell should recognise that Europe has hardly been the most tolerant place - even if we put to one side the Holocaust, slavery and global plundering, we should not forget that women's rights and gay rights are a relatively recent gain. Change, when it has come, has been gradual, and powered internally, not handed down by diktat by some outside force. </p> <p>Tatchell's heavy-handedness will not win anyone over. There certainly are times when strong-arm tactics are required in the battle for justice; but dealing with marginalised minorities is not the same as dealing with governments or powerful institutions. Instead of seeing a sympathetic figure trying to engage with them, black people see only a white man acting like a modern-day missionary, trying to impose his views. </p> <p>If nothing else, this proves the folly of the government's plan to abolish the Commission for Racial Equality and pull all equality bodies together into a single commission dealing with race, gender, disability, sexuality, age and religion. So what would happen if a gay man accused a black man of homophobia, who then countered with a racism charge? Who would decide the outcome, given that one body was supposed to represent both sides? If the commission chief was black, or gay, who could have faith in justice being done? </p> <p>The frustrating thing about the music issue is that gays and black people (and women, too) have genuine common cause here. Many of us despise the massive investment and promotion of gangsta rap by the record industry. Its lyrics and imagery promote violence, misogyny, and an extreme machismo which has spread like a cancer among black youngsters and is now infecting white youths, too. Why does Tatchell not turn his fire on those institutions whose executives are getting fatter on the misery they churn out to the masses? They give little thought to what is and isn't acceptable, happily exploiting and re-marketing the most deviant unsociable aspects of society. Yes, everyone wants to be \"ghetto fabulous\", but where these people live there are no drive-by shootings or drug dealers on the corner. </p> <p>It used to be that our music artists represented the whole spectrum of black society. To get a record deal now, young black kids have to prove they're from the \"street\", most shamelessly encapsulated in the artist 50 Cent, promoted as the man who'd been shot nine times and survived. It certainly worked - but what message does this send out to the ghettoes? </p> <p>Were Tatchell to storm the record industry's gleaming towers, rather than targeting those at the bottom of the pile, there'd be many people prepared to stand by his side. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:joseph.harker@theguardian.com\">joseph.harker@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Researchers yesterday unveiled a new fuel: clean, green and also good in a salad dressing. </p> <p>Sunflower oil is light in taste and rich in vitamin E, and Valerie Dupont of the University of Leeds believes it could also prove a handy portable source for the cleanest fuel of all, pure hydrogen. </p> <p>Plants are already used to make an automobile fuel based on alcohol, but the exhaust contains carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants. The clean-burn future rests with the fuel cell, combining hydrogen and oxygen to yield energy and water vapour, and nothing else. The cell was invented by Sir William Grove more than 150 years ago, but remained a curiosity until the Apollo space programme in the 1960s. </p> <p>Now a version has been developed to drive prototype cars and buses. There is a problem: finding a source of hydrogen. At the moment, the chief source available is burning the very fossil fuels hydrogen is intended to replace. </p> <p>Dr Dupont and her colleagues think they may have an answer: a hydrogen generator that uses only sunflower oil, air and water vapour. The secret lies in two catalysts, one based on nickel, the other on carbon. </p> <p>\"Hydrogen from sunflower oil could provide a more environmentally-friendly alternative,\" she told the American Chemical Society conference in Philadelphia yesterday. Her oil comes direct from supermarket shelves - \"we'd happily toss our salad with it.\" </p> <p>Her generator, so far, exists only on a laboratory bench, and has yet to supply hydrogen to any fuel cells. But a similar device could deliver hydrogen to the garage forecourt to fill the fuel cells of tomorrow's cars, she said. </p> <p>And if salad oil does not do the trick, water could. </p> <p>Karen Brewer of Virginia Tech told the conference that she was working on a catalytic compound which could use solar energy to split a fuel tank full of water into oxygen and the hydrogen for fuel cells. </p> <p>Water is cheap. \"But, so far, our compound is expensive,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>As gatekeepers of the world wide web, internet service providers (ISPs) play a vital role in reducing spam in your inbox. But the lack of a real consensus over how to tackle spam has led to a mixture of approaches being adopted. </p> <p>That is set to change as a result of a \"get tough\" policy agreed at a meeting of the umbrella organisation the London Internet Exchange (Linx), which handles 90% of the traffic between ISPs in the UK. </p> <p>Under the new policy, 150 ISPs have agreed to shut down websites run by spammers. These include content sites referred to in spam emails or sites that sell spamming tools, such as CD-Roms containing millions of illegally collected email addresses. </p> <p>Linx regulation officer Malcolm Hutty, said the policy represents part of an ongoing strategy against spammers. \"It won't be the end of spam, obviously, but it will make life more difficult for them.\" </p> <p>But the policy is as much about getting ISPs to face up to the legal issues around closing down spammers' sites. According to Linx, this will encourage ISPs to rewrite contracts with customers to include clauses that will allow them to close down sites if they are seen as supporting spam. </p> <p>\"With a policy like this, it supports the technical teams at an ISP who decide that a site must be shut down. Now it will be harder for management to hold them back because it becomes part of the status quo,\" said Hutty. </p> <p>Linx has had some success with a best current practice policy it released five years ago. The following year it was endorsed by Ripe (Reseaux IP European), an international forum that manages the operation of the internet. As a result of the policy, ISPs tightened up the ways their mail servers could be illegally used by spammers - so called \"open relays\". </p> <p>Linx estimates that only about 1% of spam originates in the UK, and although many spammers are based in the US, they use mail servers in other countries. </p> <p>Linx is pinning its hopes on the new anti-spam task force set up by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), which takes input from governments and meets for a second time on September 9 in Korea. \"We are taking soundings from consumer and industry groups and are looking to export whatever is best practice,\" said Jean-Jacques Sahel, head of international communications policy business relations at the Department of Trade and Industry, which will provide UK input. </p> <p>But many in the security industry remain concerned that spammers are always one step ahead. \"This is encouraging, but unfortunately spammers are like cockroaches and it will only slow them down for so long. They will re-host their sites and find new ways to get their spam out,\" said James Cowper, a senior technology consultant at Mirapoint, a messaging security vendor. </p> <p>\"This won't prove in any way effective unless they can persuade their European and global counterparts to follow suit,\" said Nick Scales, chief executive of managed email service provider Avecho.com. </p> <p>A scheme to make it harder for spammers to forge email addresses is gathering pace. Known as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), it has been endorsed by Microsoft Hotmail, Yahoo, and Google's Gmail. SPF works by ensuring that incoming email is identified against new Domain Name Server databases. In essence, it is as if your ISP is telling other ISPs that if they receive email from you from any other server than its own, it is a fake. </p> <p>Many agree that widespread adoption of SPF could make it easier to identify spam, worms, viruses, and \"phishing\" scams where spammers simulate emails from banks to gather password or credit card data. The beauty for users is that there is no work to do, since the databases are created by ISPs and domains sharing data on acceptable users. </p> <p>In addition, 80 members of the US-based Email Service Providers Coalition recently gathered at Microsoft's campus near Seattle for a summit on Sender ID, an authentication system that combines Microsoft's Caller-ID email technology with SPF. It is being evaluated by the Internet Engineering Task Force as a possible industry standard. </p> <p>Cloudmark, DoubleClick, IronPort Systems, Sendmail, Symantec, Tumbleweed, VeriSign, and Microsoft are all developing products and services that support Sender ID. </p> <p>Yahoo is also testing an authentication system called DomainKeys. This creates an encrypted email address signature, which is then checked by the receiving domain. </p> <p>But Michael Chissick, head of technology law at Field Fisher Waterhouse, says that implementing Sender ID in Europe may not be straightforward. \"It may be that ISPs will need subscribers' permission to use this due to our laws on data protection and human rights. There is also the matter of what ISPs do when they block mail on behalf of subscribers. What if it is mail that you wanted and you can prove you suffered a loss by not receiving it? The ISP may end up being liable.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>The author</strong></p> <p>Some people call comic books \"graphic novels\" because it makes them sound more grown-up and respectable. They're not and it doesn't. Novels drip feed you a steady dose of themes, ideas and subtle characterisations. Comics show you the action as it happens, as it hurts and as the author intended. But they're not just for children. You can choose not to see the complex layers and levels, but then you'll never understand why The Simpsons is more popular with adults than children. On comic shop shelves Batman and Spider-Man fight for space with Harvey Pekar, Art Spiegelman and Joe Sacco. Comics written by grown-ups, for grown-ups, to think grown-up thoughts to. </p> <p>If you like your grown-up thoughts laced with the blackest humour, pop culture references and set in a dark, dystopian near-future, Warren Ellis is for you. Bursting onto the scene in the wake of the mighty Alan Moore, Ellis is one of the brightest young British comic geniuses. He has more than 30 feature-length comic books behind him and his Global Frequency is about to become a TV series. Here, we present an exclusive, uncoloured glimpse of his latest work.

Attach the spout to it. Run your lighter's flame under the oval - heat activates the information - and inhale. Smoke music. </p> <p>And the information encoded within it is carried into your brain, plugging in to the places it needs to be. Feel the data inside the music rearranging things. You're downloading special talents. The stealth tribes, dissenting young people warping their minds for private enlightenment, becoming the internet nightmare parents always feared; are they an aspect of the changing world? ... Or are they causing it? Is all this their fault?</p>",
  "<p>I don't do science, though I love to read about it. What I do is fiction. They are such different activities that I sometimes wonder whether the same type of mind can do both. I'm not talking about science fiction; it's a respectable genre, with conventions (and Conventions, too), and a canon, and giants and minnows, and classics and trash, but I don't write it and don't much read it. I'm talking about all the rest, about the basic thing that's known as story. </p> <p>Because stories are fundamentally about individual human beings in human situations. They are the answers to questions such as What will happen when Oedipus meets Jocasta? What is Dorothea going to do when she realises she's made a terrible mistake in marrying that old stick Casaubon? What will Mr Bumble do when Oliver Twist asks for more? </p> <p>The tensions, expectations and satisfactions we get from fiction are of that sort, and it isn't science, because those aren't scientific questions. A scientific question, I take it, is one like What will happen if I drop two weights at the same moment? </p> <p>The difference is that once a scientific question is answered, it stays answered - at least, until someone changes the question. What is true for two objects of different weights will also be true, and in the same way, for another two objects of the same weights. There's an abstraction involved: we ignore the fact that this one's painted green, and the other's a bit rusty, and look only at the quality they have in common. Scientific statements are about similar entities behaving in similar ways; what is true for this elementary particle will be true for every other particle of the same kind. In fact, particles such as electrons are so similar that not even their mothers could tell them apart, and as I understand it, there's even a theory that there is only one electron in the universe, but it gets about a lot. </p> <p>There's no abstract human who will always behave in the same way - except in economics, where every human being is assumed to be rational and selfish to exactly the same degree as every other. No wonder it was called the Dismal Science. </p> <p>In real life, and in fiction, human beings are much more variable. There's only one Dorothea. However, the variability of fictional human beings involves an odd paradox: the more vividly particular and individual, the more distinct from every other invented character, the more recognisably truthful we think them. </p> <p>So doing science is not the same as doing fiction. But science as a background to fiction is different. It has to do what all backgrounds do - stand firm and solid. It must not sway alarmingly when someone walks into it or sound hollow when struck, it must conform to the rules of perspective and be vivid enough to convince but not so hectic as to distract. </p> <p>There's one further thing to say about backgrounds, and it's this: in a story, we are not on oath. We're not taking an exam. The function of research is not to provide me with lots of facts to put into a story unaltered, but to enable me to make up new \"facts\" that look convincing. The test can only be If I read this, in a book by someone else, would I be taken in? I can't hope to deceive a real expert, but I might deceive the moderately intelligent reader. And if a real expert did read it, I'd hope they might say This man's done a bit of homework. </p> <p>When it comes to science, it's not hard, these days, to find enough superb writers and fascinating material to satisfy your most demanding interior set-designer. In biology and evolution, there are Richard Dawkins, Steven Jay Gould, Jared Diamond, Jonathan Kingdon, EO Wilson; if it's physics that tickles your fancy, there are David Deutsch, Michio Kaku, Bryan Greene; to find out about cosmology, there are John Gribbin, Martin Rees, Paul Davies. And if you're intrigued by the deepest mystery of the lot, consciousness, you can read Antonio Damasio, and Adam Zeman, and Max Velmans, and VS Ramachandran ... I have read books by all these people, and I haven't even mentioned Roger Penrose. </p> <p>It isn't hard to find things out. But the best reason to read about science is not to check facts, but to revel in wonder. Part of the impulse behind my longest story lay in the extraordinary poetry of the phrase \"dark matter\", and my discovery that Milton had anticipated it in Paradise Lost: </p> <p>Unless the Almighty Maker them ordained<br>His dark materials to create new worlds </p> <p>When you come to write the story, you mustn't lose that first impulse of wonder. Science and fiction deal with different entities, and ask different questions; but each can intoxicate, inspire, console, and feed that appetite for mystery and revelation that makes human beings at least as interesting as electrons.</p>",
  "<p>There was a blissful moment on holiday - shortly before a child had to be pulled out of a peat bog - when we paused. Whatever direction we looked in, however hard we listened, the only sign of human existence was our own. Three miles from the nearest road on the Ardnamurchan peninsula on the west coast of Scotland, we were in an eerie landscape of bog grass and huge boulders. Then, above our heads soared three eagles, and not long after, an adder slithered calmly between our feet. </p> <p>An annual dose of this remote wildness is an essential antidote to inner city life for me. The clouds of midges and rain are a small price to pay for its restorative properties. And the children get to feel rain, sun, wind, and discover wildlife beyond a television screen - childhood experiences which feel like essentials, not luxuries. But there's a fundamental contradiction behind our foray into the wilderness. It entails a round trip of 1,680 odd miles which accounts for almost half the carbon emissions for the year caused by the average individual. The rest of the year, I mostly use buses or cycle, but come the summer, I blow my credit in a spectacular carbon bonanza. How do you justify a journey that will damage the very experience you so much appreciate? </p> <p>That was the kind of questioning which environmental author Mayer Hillman put to his audience at an uncomfortable seminar to launch his book How We Can Save the Planet last month. A veteran campaigner on environmental issues, he's a Jeremiah figure, lambasting those who will listen for their moral failure to adapt their lifestyle to reduce carbon emissions. For an audience no doubt contemplating their imminent summer holidays, his rage against the scandal of growing carbon emissions from cheap air flights, made for some awkward shifting in seats. He never flies. His message on transport is stark: travel less and best of all, don't travel at all. </p> <p>The Blairs should be showing the way with a fortnight in Clacton-on-Sea instead of clocking up the air miles on the unforgivable, a twin-destination break in the Caribbean and Tuscany. I should swap holidays in Ardnamurchan for Essex, or better, stay at home. </p> <p>Hillman's message sounded pretty off the wall coming as it did at the beginning of the summer holidays. It was similarly brave of the Commons environmental audit committee to recommend that despite rising oil prices, the government must increase taxes on petrol to curb the increasing carbon emissions from cars at a time when Britain's roads are heaving with the annual migration. </p> <p>The unpalatable truth is that unless it hurts it ain't working. This week's hefty price increases for gas and electricity are the kind of thing that by 2010 could be commonplace. The era of affordable energy is drawing to a close and lifestyles built on its cheap abundance will have to be painfully adjusted. Take the simple matter of kitchen lighting (a subject of which I've had to grasp a sketchy knowledge in the past few weeks); while our parents would have happily had a single light bulb, Ikea sells halogen spots in packs of three and before you know it, the kitchen is a glowing festival, courtesy of nearly a dozen lights. </p> <p>Only excruciating utility bills will check the house make-over enthusiasts. It will take humungous hikes in fuel tax, with punishing electoral consequences, to wean us off the impulse to escape at least once a year from lives which we've made so hectic, we have to have a holiday to restore our sanity. It's a measure of how enormous the gap is between how we live and what needs to change in order to slow down climate change. </p> <p>Hillman has packed plenty of other tips for low carbon living into his daunting book. Don't boil your kettle so often; turn the heating down in the winter and wear woolly jumpers instead; use those dim, energy-efficient lightbulbs; recycle as much as you can, and take fewer showers. It sounds impossibly worthy, and rather smelly. What will induce people to take his advice? The analogy he draws is with his boyhood experience of rationing in the second world war. The crucial difference is that then the danger was immediate, but by the time climate change has a comparably direct, destructive impact on people's lives, it will be way too late to do much. The kind of odd weather we've had recently may be the first signs of climate change but it's hardly comparable so far to the danger of the Third Reich. </p> <p>Hillman's preoccupation is to get individuals to take personal responsibility for global warming and he provides formulae by which individuals can calculate their own carbon consumption. That takes him to the idea of personal carbon rations; every service or product we purchase would require not only a swipe of our debit card but also of our carbon card so that the carbon impact of our consumption is deducted. Here, I'm with him.</p> <p>While I'm sceptical about the value of persuading people of the virtues of fewer showers, in contrast, carbon rations has all the plausibility of an idea which will be commonplace in a couple of decades, perhaps sooner. If everyone is given the same allocation - a big \"if\" - it has the potential to be a radically redistributive measure with the less well-off able to sell their unused allocation. Until then, the dilemma is that the enormity of climate change makes individual action pretty meaningless. </p> <p>Giving up my trek to the Ardnamurchan peat bog would be a considerable personal sacrifice, but all the benefit of it would be handsomely cancelled out by a friend's weekend trip to New York (which produces carbon emissions the equivalent to two years' household gas supply). The moral exhortations of Hillman and fellow environmentalists don't gain fertile ground because they make no rational sense. </p> <p>The analogy of the meaningless individual sacrifices at an international level is that even if Britain blazed a trail of exemplary, carbon-friendly behaviour, all our efforts would be cancelled out by the carbon-belching US. The solutions to climate change have to be collective, involving not just the local community or even nation, but the entire globe.

  "<p>It sounds like a sci-fi nightmare, but it could be every teenage geek's dream: a computer worm that can wriggle into bedrooms and secretly hijack webcams to spy on people. </p> <p>A warning was issued yesterday about a new \"peeping Tom\" computer virus that can take over computers and invade homes and businesses. </p> <p>The Rbot-GR worm installs itself in users' machines like a normal virus, but then secretly takes control of the webcam and microphone, sending images and sound back to the hacker who dispatched it. </p> <p>The virus enables hackers to see everything another user does in front of their computer and hear everything they say without their knowledge if their webcam is switched on, according to Sophos, an Oxford-based anti-virus firm. </p> <p>The worm, which affects only personal computers with Windows software, can also look at information on the hard drive of an infected computer and steal passwords. </p> <p>Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said Rbot-GR had been detected in the past few days, but it remained a rare virus at this stage. </p> <p>While the worm could be a lucrative tool for thieves and hi-tech industrial espionage, it is likely to prove more popular with teenage hackers who want to snoop around strangers' bedrooms. </p> <p>\"This particular worm can capture what is on your webcam,\" said Mr Cluley. </p> <p>\"Even if the camera is switched off, it will try switching it back on. </p> <p>\"Whether this worm is the work of professional snoopers or lusty teenagers - it is hard to say for certain. My theory is that the average hacker is a young male and the thought of spying on other people's bedrooms can be quite intoxicating. </p> <p>\"I think it is mostly out of curiosity. Previously worms have been programmed to look at your hard disk, but this one can look in the room around your computer.\" </p> <p>Computer users, particularly those with machines in their bedrooms or a broadband connection which permanently links them to the internet, are advised to ensure they have the latest anti-virus software. Users can also protect their privacy by ensuring their webcam is unplugged or the lens is covered with tape when it is not in use. </p> <p>As news of the worm spread around the global internet community, users on the message boards of Slashdot greeted the news with glee. </p> <p>One said: \"I think I speak for the majority of geeks who can't get any when I ask: where can I get said worm?\"</p>",

  "<p>The announcement that British Gas is to increase its residential prices by another 12% this year, and electricity prices by more than 9%, will send a chill through the wallets of its customers - even if the increase is no surprise for those who have been watching wholesale prices creep upwards. </p> <p>Coming at a time when international oil prices are hovering around record levels, up by 40% from a year earlier, the prospect of more expensive energy prices throughout the economy sounds a dire note. But it is not just energy prices that are rising: around the world, commodity prices have also been rising strongly during the past year. From soybeans to iron ore, the costs of raw materials have been steadily increasing. </p> <p>A sign of these rising times is the news that Britain's exports of scrap metal are on course to top the \u00a31bn a year mark, putting it on a par with this country's exports of machine tools and appliances. What this shows - other than the long observed decline in the British manufacturing sector - is the appetite for humble scrap for furnaces in places such as Japan and Turkey. </p> <p>But what is good news for Britain's scrap merchants and car wreckers is not necessarily best for British consumers. The global background of rising commodity prices - and the resurgent fuel costs driving up the transport charges in moving them around the globe - is likely to cause a knock-on effect in terms of rising prices generally. </p> <p>While this is already being felt at the petrol pump, and shortly in gas and electricity bills, the cumulative effect may well be a gradual rise in the overall price level, and presumably lead to a surge in inflation. The increased gas and electricity charges, if passed on to consumers across the board, will add something like 0.3 percentage points to overall inflation on its own, while higher oil prices can be expected to add a similar proportion. </p> <p>Does this mean we should brace our selves for a rerun of the energy shocks of the 1970s? Almost certainly not - especially as fuel prices are still far below 1970s levels when adjusted for inflation. What it does mean is that the triple crown of rock-bottom commodity prices, weak inflation and low interest rates that the UK and the rest of the world's developed economies have enjoyed for the last six or seven years has come to an end. </p> <p>Since the implosion of the \"Asian tiger\" economies in 1997, followed by the disruption in Russia and other emerging markets, the industrialised nations have benefited from the background of lower prices, which encouraged a brief but robust period of economic growth. Now, though, many of the tigers are roaring again, and have been joined by China, the biggest beast in the jungle, and by a recovery in Japan. Brazilian soybean farmers and iron ore producers are better off, while Britain's consumers are likely to pay higher prices. </p> <p>This does not mean that we can expect some sort of Soylent Green-style dystopia in the short term, or even the long term. Higher gas and oil prices does mean less money for consumers to spend elsewhere. The country will be a little worse off, in terms of lower growth than in recent years. That is bad news for the government's fiscal position, if it is banking on projections of rising taxable incomes to bail it out. Should a sustained rise in the consumer price index lead to higher interest rates and lower economic growth, then the political fallout could become distinctly uncomfortable for the government. </p> <p>But there are some bright spots. One is that higher prices for carbon-emitting fuels such as gas or oil make the cost of alternative energy sources cheaper by comparison. That should encourage the investment in, and widespread adoption of, renewable energy in the form of wind, wave and solar generators: no panacea to be sure, but no bad thing.</p>",
  "He is sitting down when I enter the echoing, well-used function room in the Brixton Recreation Centre, so for the moment I am taking it on faith that Luol Deng is 6ft 8in, with a wingspan - lovely concept, that - of 7ft. A handshake, a wary look, though I don't see what I and my tape recorder can do to him: throughout the interview there will be five or six other men in the room, vigilant and protective as UN observers. <p>Only in basketball would Deng be called a small forward. He is such a good small forward, however, that he has just been signed by the Chicago Bulls for $6.3m over three years. Apparently, the Bulls aren't at their strongest, past the heyday when Michael Jordan ensured that even those who knew nothing about basketball knew the Bulls, but they are still a big deal, and so, suddenly, is Deng. Hence the posse, the 15 minutes of face time I'm told I'll be permitted, and the anxious PR man for PlayStation buzzing around saying, \"You will mention PlayStation 2, won't you? Won't you?\" </p> <p>But this is also the gym in which Deng has trained for seven years, ever since coming to Britain in 1994 (and PlayStation 2 sponsors Hosana, an organisation that supports grassroots basketball throughout the UK). This, Deng says, is home, and the observers are two brothers, a couple of guys from Hosana and his childhood coach, Jimmy Rogers, who still teaches the youth of Brixton the joys of bouncing balls. So it is starry and entirely unstarry at the same time, a shambolic collision of NBA control and simple Brixton mess. </p> <p>In previous interviews, Deng has referred to his family's move from Sudan, via Egypt, as \"a tough journey that has helped me mature that much quicker\" to seeing \"things that a lot of adults have never seen and never will\". But when I ask what he means, specifics elude him. \"I left Sudan at a very young age, so I don't really remember much.\" Six years' training in the US has given him a languid American accent. What was life like in Sudan? \"To be honest ... \" He laughs, rather engagingly at a loss, and I'm reminded that despite the poise, and watchfulness, he is only 19. \"I can't ... \" </p> <p>Luol's father, Aldo Deng, later fills in the gaps. The Dengs - Luol is the eighth of nine children, Aldo has two other wives and a total of 16 offspring - were a wealthy landowning family (\"We had farms, cars, houses\"). Aldo was elected to parliament in 1967, and by 1989 had served as a provincial governor, as deputy speaker (twice), as a minister of culture, of irrigation, of transport, and as deputy prime minister. But they are also Dinka, a southern Sudanese Christian tribe notable for its height, but known mainly in the west for its misfortunes: women and children sold into slavery in Sudan are frequently Dinka. </p> <p>In 1989, the elected government was overthrown and Sharia law imposed. Aldo Deng was imprisoned for three months, then released on condition that he negotiate peace between the Christian south and the Muslim north. That year, when Luol was four, he took the precaution of sending his family to Alexandria. On December 15, 1993, on the pretext of a holiday, Aldo left Khartoum for London; the following month, he claimed political asylum. </p> <p>Luol is a bit hazy about Egypt, too. Did they live in a refugee camp? \"We were refugees, but I never really went to a refugee camp,\" then, \"not basketball, or any other refugee camp.\" All the same, in Alexandria they were so poor that the Catholic church had to come to their rescue with food; the Egyptian government provided free education. </p> <p>What would have become of them if they hadn't left? \"The lucky ones would have gone into the army. Others might have died. They would have been mistreated because of my name. So many relatives, so many supporters, have died because of my name.\" </p> <p>Another brother shambles in, sits down next to Luol, introduces himself as Ajou, \"the tallest one\". And how tall is that? \"6ft 11in\". Four of Luol's siblings play competitive basketball; Ajou, injured a year ago, used to play for the universities of Connecticut and Fairfield, and wants to turn professional; Akuei used to play for Brixton Top Cats; sister Arek, plays for Delaware University; Deng Deng plays for Plymouth. </p> <p>The family was aided by the appearance one summer of NBA star Manute Bol; a 7ft 7in Dinka who ploughed much of his accrued millions back into charitable causes back home, as well as into the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). On holiday in Alexandria, Bol saw the brothers knocking a ball about, taught them some rules and became a family friend. </p> <p>In time the children joined Aldo, and the family has lived ever since in refugee housing in south London on income support, augmented latterly by what the now-grown children earn. \"Our family has been supported by British taxation,\" says Aldo Deng. \"All my children have finished university and even I got involved in studying. We are very grateful. We are not like other refugees who don't remember.\" </p> <p>They spoke Arabic and Dinka, but initially no English; at home They \"mix it up,\" says Luol with a mischievous grin. \"You gotta be one of the family to understand what we're saying, but mostly we speak Dinka.\" </p> <p>Basketball in Brixton provided a way of belonging. \"You don't need to speak the language,\" says Ajou. \"Basketball got us a long way. It gave us education.\" By the time he was 13, Luol had been asked to play for England's 15-and-under teams in both football and basketball. Reluctantly, realising he was too tall, \"except if I wanted to be a goalie or something\", he relinquished football, and later led England to the finals of the European junior tournament in basketball in Poland. Arek has also played for England. </p> <p>But the only place for an ambitious basketball player to go is America, and both Luol and his sister won scholarships to the Blair Academy in New Jersey, where he was bitterly homesick. By the time he graduated he was ranked second-best high-school player in the country. Recruiters were so keen to sign him up he once even found one lying in wait for him when he came out of the shower. </p> <p>He lasted only a year at Duke University before entering his name for the NBA draft. This did not make him popular with Duke fans: online message boards are rife with accusations of betrayal and money-grubbing. \"Most kids go to school to find a job to eventually support their family, and support themselves,\" says Luol. \"I put myself in that position in one year, so there's really no need to stay the next three years.\" He does promise that he will get around to graduating at some point. </p> <p>What, particularly, would have prompted the Bulls to pick him? \"If you're just good at one thing you're not really a basketball player,\" he says. \"I can't really tell you one particular thing.\" \"He's very talented,\" offers Anjou, \"but everyone in college basketball is talented. To be better than everybody you have to work hard. That's what he does. He works hard.\" </p> <p>They are all proud of him, says Luol, \"but in the family you still get treated the same - as soon as you walk in the door you're still the same kid and if you're messing up, your mom is still going to get on you, but when you gotta walk outside the door, and you see your fans and stuff, it's this kind of different world.\" So he has a lot of fans? \"Yeah. So I try to stay indoors with my family.\" </p> <p>At the moment, both brothers are jumping through the hoops necessary to get British passports - they would love to play for England in the Commonwealth games in 2006, and in the next Olympics. It also means, says Aldo, that Luol will pay taxes to Britain, and not the States (Luol has apparently refused a green card): \"This is the country that rescued us from the most difficult country in Africa,\" he says; they want to pay something back. The Dengs will at last be able to stop claiming income support, and - though I'm not sure how Luol feels about this - his father hopes he will buy a small shop, to give his other relatives something to do. </p> <p>And finally, there is Sudan. Ever since he arrived in England, Aldo Deng has, he says, been working to help southern Sudan: he has chaired various charities and reports on human rights for the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement; he has set up the Deng International Foundation to support children, women, schools and healthcare; recently, he has been among those attempting to warn about the severity of what is happening in Darfur. Eastern Africa is a prime training ground for terrorists, he points out, and some are among the Janjaweed. His most famous son also feels a sense of duty: \"I'm in a position financially where I could build something or support a kid [in Sudan]. It's not something I would do just because people expect me to. I believe that I can make a difference.\" </p> <p>Finally, he is dragged off for a photo shoot with some children at a basketball camp, some of whom, swamped in their strip, barely reach his knees. Far above his head, on the walls of the gym that made him a player, are encouraging slogans. Rough and Ready. Hoop Dreams Reality. Respect Given.</p>"
