  "<p>A project to assess the world's ecosystems has found that the widespread use of fertilisers and the burning of fossil fuels will severely damage life in lakes and rivers around the globe. </p> <p>The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, launched by the World Bank in Washington in 2001, examines how any disruption to the environment, whether by human action or natural events, will harm human health, food production and natural resources. </p> <p>Scientists have spent the past three years piecing together data from thousands of studies. Their official report will be published early next year, but a first draft shows a number of alarming trends. </p> <p>A major concern is the increase in nitrogen emissions because of fertiliser use and the burning of fossil fuels. </p> <p>\"In the past 100 years, emissions have risen from around 20m tonnes a year to more than 150m tonnes a year,\" said Robert Watson, the project leader and the World Bank's chief scientist. \"We're emitting more than seven times more nitrogen and that is going to have incredible implications for ecological systems.\" </p> <p>As an ingredient in fertiliser, nitrogen helps to feed some 2 billion people. But when it is washed from soils into water courses it can make rivers and lakes too rich in nutrients. </p> <p>As a result, algae and other life can grow out of control, eventually stripping oxygen from the water which fish and other aquatic life need. </p> <p>Dead zones have already begun to appear, notably in the Gulf of Mexico, which is fed by nitrogen-rich water from the Mississippi river. \"We are looking at major effects in the US, Europe and south-east Asia,\" Dr Watson said. </p> <p>As the world's population is estimated to grow to 9 billion in 40 years, food production is expected to become more intensive, requiring ever more nitrogen-rich fertiliser. </p> <p>Kenneth Cassman, an expert on environmental health at the University of Nebraska, said the efficiency of nitrogen use needed to be \"massively improved\". \"There are a number among us who think this is more important than carbon emissions, in terms of environmental impact,\" he said. </p> <p>In a separate part of the study, the scientists found that global warming would severely disrupt ecosystems, especially in the developing world, if it was not kept in check. An increase of more than 2C (3.6F) would be enough to severely degrade the availability of food, water and human health in developing countries. </p> <p>Dr Watson, who worked as a scientific adviser to the White House during the Clinton administration, said that while the final report would describe different ways the problems might be dealt with, it was up to governments and private companies to collaborate. </p> <p>\"We can move in a direction where we destroy our natural heritage or we can move in a direction where we improve both human wellbeing and maintain our natural heritage,\" he said. \"We've got choices and we have to decide which future we want.\"</p>",
  "Wangari Maathai, the Kenyan who created a women's movement which has planted more than 30m trees in 20 countries, became the first African woman to win the Nobel peace prize yesterday. <p>The award to recognises an effort which began in 1977 when she walked into the ministry of forests in Nairobi and asked for 15m tree seedlings to stop soil erosion, provide fuel and improve the lot of the poorest communities. </p> <p>The director laughed in her face, but told her she could have as many as she wanted. </p> <p>Less than a year later he had to withdraw his offer because the demand was so great. </p> <p>Twenty-seven years ago Professor Maathai, now an MP, Kenya's assistant environment minister, and the recipient of numerous international awards and honours, was head of veterinary anatomy at Nairobi University and had just set up the Green Belt Movement. </p> <p>\"It's important for people to see that they are part of the environment and that they take responsibility for it,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I feel extremely elated. This is something I would never have dreamt of.\" </p> <p>Her award, for \"promoting ecologically viable social, economic and cultural development in Kenya and in Africa\", was welcomed as recognition of African women's efforts to improve their lives and the importance of grassroots environmental initiatives. </p> <p>\"Wangari Maathai has made an incredible contribution to improving the environment and society, not only in Africa but worldwide\" said Tony Juniper, director of Friends of the Earth in London. </p> <p>Klaus T\u00f6pfer, director of the UN environment programme, said: \"She is a leader whose example should inspire us all, especially the women and children of Africa, who shoulder so much of the continent's burden of poverty, conflict and environmental degradation\". </p> <p>Prof Maathai, 64, says she turned to trees to give Kenyan women self-confidence. </p> <p>In 1989 she told the Guardian: \"[We] are overwhelmed by experts who sap confidence. People [have been made to] believe they are ignorant, inexperienced, incapable and backward. The idea of setting up the Green Belt Movement is to create local expertise to create confidence.\" </p> <p>She encouraged the setting up of more than 5,000 tree nurseries, which were run by women and disabled people. </p> <p>\"The biggest impact is the sense of hope and power in the lives of the ordinary women who make up 90% of the Green Belt members. </p> <p>\"They can hardly read or write. The women respond so quickly to a common cause that soon they see this as a way to help the community at large, and the nation. They want to make a contribution.\" </p> <p>Initially tolerated by President Moi, Prof Maathai outraged his one-party state by leading protests against the erection of a 62-storey building in the middle of Uhuru (Freedom) park, Nairobi's most important public space. </p> <p>The building, commissioned by the government party, Kanu, was to be funded by the late Robert Maxwell. </p> <p>\"The growth of an impersonal concrete jungle directly leads to the psychosis, neuroses, maniacal and freakish behaviour evident in the major cities of the so-called developed world,\" she said. </p> <p>Mr Moi called her and the Green Belt Movement \"subversive\" and she was vilified in parliament and in the press, beaten up and forced to flee the country. But foreign investors withdrew their support and the building project was cancelled. </p> <p>When she returned to Kenya she took up the cause of political prisoners, and directly attacked Mr Moi for commandeering forests and throwing out tribal groups. </p> <p>In 1999 there was three days of rioting in Nairobi, and international outrage, after she and thousands of supporters were beaten and teargassed while trying to plant trees in Karura forest, near the city. </p> <p>Fifty of this year's record 194 nominations for the peace prize were for organisations, the rest for individuals. The nominations are not revealed.</p>",
  "Up to 4,000 asylum seekers drown at sea every year as they flee persecution or poverty, according to newly published British research. <p>Fear of terrorism and public scares about mass migration have led to more vigilant coastal patrols and an international climate that discourages captains from stopping to help small boats in distress, says Professor Michael Pugh of Plymouth University. </p> <p>His figures derive from interviews with refugees, records of bodies washed up on shores, wrecks and government statistics. </p> <p>They suggest that about 2,000 people perish annually in the Mediterranean trying to reach prosperous European states. A similar number are thought to die on crossings to Australia and the United States - the two other main destinations for boat people. </p> <p>Prof Pugh, who believes that he is the first to produce such global statistics, stresses that the numbers are, inevitably, estimates. </p> <p>Up to a third of the people who set out on perilous crossings fail to land safely, he says in his study, Drowning not Waving, published in the Jour nal of Refugee Studies. \"The Spanish produce reasonable records of the bodies they find, but many people think that's an underestimate. </p> <p>\"It's a hidden tragedy because there are few aid organisations at sea to monitor the situation and undertake rescues. In the past, captains were concerned that they were being decoyed by people who might turn out to be pirates. Now their concerns are that they could be attacked by al-Qaida.\" </p> <p>Such fears, says Prof Pugh, are usually unfounded. \"There are far easier ways of attacking western targets and it's the lives of refugees and migrants that are most at risk. Yet politicians in the UK, southern Europe and Australia have fabricated refugees and migrants as a 'security threat', even sending out warships to turn back boats on the high seas. In part, this is to make capital in domestic politics.\" </p> <p>Three German aid workers were arrested recently after their ship, Cap Anamur, docked in Sicily with 37 African refugees they had picked up from an inflatable dinghy. The asylum seekers initially claimed to be fleeing the stricken Darfur region of Sudan, but were later shown to be from Ghana and Nigeria. The vessels hired by those trafficking migrants and asylum seekers are often old and unseaworthy, Prof Pugh points out. \"Many have no, or only limited, navigation aids or charts. They have unreliable engines and steering and little by way of safety equipment.\" </p> <p>Last week, 64 African migrants were feared drowned after their overcrowded boat capsized en route from Tunisia to the Italian island of Lampedusa. Most of the victims were thought to be Moroccans. </p> <p>Prof Pugh, who lectures in international relations, suspects that the numbers dying at sea have risen recently. Fatality rates were probably higher, however, during the 1970s, when tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people crossed the South China Sea. Many were attacked by pirates. </p> <p>\"The International Maritime Organisation should encourage support for seafarers who adhere scrupulously to the norms of humanitarianism at sea,\" Prof Pugh concludes, \"if necessary regulating the shipping industry to ensure that masters are not penalised for bona fide rescue deviations and delays.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are few fairy godmothers who have turned their charges back into a pumpkin. But Karen Thomson, the UK head of internet service provider AOL, did exactly that when she consigned her Cinderella to the wastebasket of dotcom history last year.</p> <p>Connie, for those who were living in a cave during the heady days of the internet boom, was the prissy, public face of the American company this side of the Atlantic until the advertising campaign she starred in was unceremoniously dumped last summer. </p> <p>\"I did not invent her myself,\" the 43- year-old Scot explained in her office at AOL UK's headquarters in Hammersmith, west London. \"I am not Connie's mother, I was more like her fairy godmother, saying 'you shall go to the ball'.\" </p> <p>The ball lasted five years as AOL used Connie - Rachel Willis, daughter of the Liberal Democrat MP Phil Willis - to persuade middle England to get online.</p> <p>\"Connie was all about hand-holding,\" said Thomson. She was the acceptable face of the internet, hawking a safe and secure way to get onto the net. But while the public seemed to like her, others in the media were not so keen. Campaign, the advertising industry bible, gave her the ignominious title of biggest turkey of 2000, the height of the boom. </p> <p>The decision to axe Connie - \"We decided that she would go off and spend more time with her family,\" Thomson quipped - came as AOL moved itself into the market for providing fast, always-on broadband internet access. </p> <p>Moving its customers from dial-up internet access to the world of broadband is part of an evolutionary process that is still continuing. </p> <p>This month the industry regulator Ofcom will give its first indication of what the UK's communications market should look like and AOL is already planning for that future, looking at internet telephony, video-on-demand and even ways of leveraging its mammoth brand in the mobile phone world. </p> <p>And while Connie lasted just five years, Thomson has been with the firm for nine. Not bad for somebody who started out training to be a doctor and refuses to be labelled a \"techie\" in an industry where nerds rule. </p> <p>Born in Dundee, her family moved across the Tay and Firth of Forth when she was nine and she grew up in Edinburgh. After leaving school she went to university in Aberdeen, choosing medicine because everybody at the time seemed to think a profession was the best idea. It wasn't. </p> <p>\"I got there and met lots of people who had a true vocation for medicine and I thought, 'I am not entirely sure I do have the vocation for it',\" she said. </p> <p>\"I remember opening this folder which was essentially my work plan for the next five years, so I could say 'in four years time on Monday, 17 August, at whatever time, I will be doing this' and almost none of it was about dealing with people. </p> <p>\"So I said, 'I am not enjoying this and next year I want to change'. The dean said, 'we throw people out, they don't leave' but they eventually realised I had thought about it a lot.\" </p> <p>She moved on to an arts course and specialised in philosophy. While great fun at the time, it was not necessarily the most vocational of degrees and when she emerged from academia into the harsh recessionary climate of the early 1980s, it became obvious that a deep understanding of moral philosophy was no help in getting a job. </p> <p>She ended up selling advertising on the Aberdeen Evening Express and the Press and Journal. When asked whether she enjoyed it, she faltered. \"I would say it is the most high pressure, hardest work I have ever done in my entire life. I would not say I enjoyed it, I enjoyed working with the people ... but for me it was the job when I started to see that I was interested in marketing.\"</p> <p>After getting married in 1985, her husband, Neil, was offered a job with a London- based consultancy firm. </p> <p>They decided to give London two years. In fact she has been 'down south' for almost two decades but retains her broad Scottish accent. </p> <p>Following a marketing services job with a company that made controls for lifts, she realised that her slightly eccentric academic background was doing her few favours - \"partly because every job I went for they asked me why I had done a philosophy degree and the whole thing about how it teaches you to think properly was not helping\". </p> <p>Thomson enrolled on a three-year, parttime MBA course at Middlesex University and switched jobs, joining a communications company in the fast-growing world of pagers and mobile telephones - first with a subsidiary of BellSouth and then with Mercury. </p> <p>She finished at Middlesex just as she became pregnant. It was one of the few times during our conversation that she talked about the position of women in the world of work. </p> <p>\"When I think back, there were very few women on the course. I was a good bit younger than the norm and I do not think any women who had kids finished the course. I think dealing with the three together would have been hideous.\" </p> <p>After the birth of her daughter she took a break, taking part-time marketing consultancy work until a fateful call from a headhunter friend in 1995. \"She said, 'I've got this really bizarre job and I thought of you immediately'.\" </p> <p>It was with a yet to be named internet company that wanted somebody with expertise in branding and direct marketing. At the time only a few people this side of the Atlantic knew about the worldwide web, and Thomson frankly admitted: \"I wasn't one of them\". </p> <p>During her interview she boldly informed her prospective bosses that it would take longer than they hoped to get up and running, and then asked to actually see the service. She was hooked. </p> <p>\"The first time you move from a text-based environment to a graphics-based environment, as basic as it was, you go 'oh, so I can just click here?'. Then suddenly an instant message popped up.\" </p> <p>\"I remember thinking there is something there. I went home that night and said to Neil, 'Well, I think I'm too bossy for them to start with because I have told them they cannot launch when they want to, but I saw this thing called instant messaging' and he is looking at me like 'how dull is this'.\" </p> <p>Despite his reservations, she became the fifth employee of AOL in the UK, joining as marketing director. As she predicted, the company launched at the start of 1996. Her experience in the cut-throat world of direct marketing served AOL well at the beginning. Although it now uses its own call centre staff and retailers - most notably the former Freeserve backer Dixons - to attract customers, AOL originally built its customer base by pushing CD-rom disks through people's letterboxes and into magazines and newspapers. At the time, its biggest draw was the offer of a free trial and by August 1996, AOL had attracted 50,000 customers. That doubled by the following Easter and by 1998, the company had more than 500,000 subscribers.</p> <p>Now AOL UK has more than 2.3 million customers, with more than half a million of those taking one of its three broadband offerings. It also made a profit last year, although Thomson is unwilling to say how much. </p> <p>Whether that is sustainable, however, with AOL's bitter rival Wanadoo - formerly Freeserve - offering broadband at a loss-leading price of \u00a317.99, remains to be seen. \"You have got to be competitive on price,\" she admitted, but she believes that people will pay a little extra not to have the amount they can download each month capped - as is the case with the Wanadoo service and BT's \u00a319.99 offering. </p> <p>\"Obviously we want to lead the market but it is not a question of doing that at any price,\" she said. </p> <p>So what about the future? Many in the industry are getting excited about the prospects of local loop unbundling - the process by which BT will have to give up its stranglehold on the phone line that connects every house in the country to a local exchange. Across the Channel this process has allowed rivals to France T\u00e9l\u00e9com to offer very fast broadband, digital television, video-on-demand and even free local and national calls for about \u00a325 a month. </p> <p>Here, AOL UK is already looking into unbundling partners to provide it with the network capabilities to challenge BT. It will also be using an interim access technology BT is being pressed to provide known as Datastream - which opens the door to products above and beyond the basic broadband services available until now. </p> <p>\"I would be fibbing if I said to you we weren't looking at fixed-line, mobile, video etc, and that we were on different stages of development on all those things; of course we are.\" </p> <p>\"It's a question of deciding where the focus should be and when we introduce those products .\" It looks as if the fairy godmother is preparing to wave her wand again.</p>",
  "Radical Islamist propaganda calling on Afghans to join a global jihad against \"oil-thieving Christian crusaders\" has begun appearing in Afghanistan, signalling an attempt by foreign militants to stoke an Iraqi-style insurgency. <p>A glossy colour poster juxtaposes photos of charred American corpses swinging from a bridge in Falluja with that of a US soldier apparently frisking a burka-wearing Afghan woman. </p> <p>A DVD links gory footage of Taliban operations in Afghanistan, violence in Indonesia and the beheading of American businessman Nicholas Berg in Baghdad. </p> <p>The propaganda has been discreetly distributed in the run-up to today's presidential election, which pits the US-supported interim president Hamid Karzai against 15 challengers. </p> <p>\"This is a significant migration of tactics. I've never seen quality material with an international outlook like this before,\" said Nick Downie, a British security adviser to international aid agencies. \"It's a call to global jihad.\" </p> <p>US, coalition and Afghan troops were on high alert yesterday for possible attacks by Taliban insurgents, who have vowed to derail the historic vote. </p> <p>About 5,000 polling stations are due to open at 7am this morning. </p> <p>In the past week security forces have intercepted bombs smuggled on bicycles, in fruit carts and motor cars. Clashes with US-led forces in the volatile southern provinces have intensified. Yesterday Nato troops mounted foot patrols and searched vehicles in Kabul, after a rocket landed 200 metres from a fortified US compound. </p> <p>Extra blast barriers have been put up in front of embassies, UN buildings and private security firms, and trucks have been banned from the city centre. </p> <p>Aid agencies across the country have temporarily frozen operations, and many have evacuated international staff. </p> <p>But the predicted wave of attacks - compared by the US ambassador to the Tet offensive of the Vietnam war - had failed to materialise by yesterday evening. </p> <p>\"I've got my fingers and toes crossed that there won't be some ghastly attack on a voting centre. But God knows what's going on under the surface,\" said aid worker Barbara Stapleton. </p> <p>Al-Qaida and foreign militants retain links of unknown strength with the Taliban rebels. The propaganda poster seen by the Guardian - which security analysts speculated had been printed in Pakistan - attempts to provoke Afghan sensitivities about the treatment of women. </p> <p>Afghan beauty contest competitor Vida Samadzai, pictured wearing a bikini, is described as a \"prostitute\" corrupted by the Christian \"crusaders\". </p> <p>The image of a burka-wearing woman being searched carries the taunt: \"Are there any brave Afghan men to forcefully take the dirty hands of the crusaders from this innocent Afghan virgin?\" </p> <p>However one diplomat suggested the radical message was unlikely to win widespread support. \"Afghans are conservative by nature but they are not fundamentalists,\" he said. </p> <p>Islamists are not the only menace to today's poll. Human rights groups warn of intimidation by warlords who still control much of the country. Several candidates, such as former minister Yunus Qanooni, have informal links with armed groups. Election officials are also concerned about the performance of over 100,000 lightly-trained polling staff, most of whom have never voted. </p> <p>Votes will be transferred by road, helicopter and donkey to eight highly-secured counting centres, and first results are expected late tomorrow, although a final tally will not be announced for about two weeks. </p> <p>A run-off poll will be held two weeks later if no candidate has secured 51% of the vote. </p> <p>Failure to seriously disrupt the voting will make it much more difficult for the Taliban to recruit new jihadis, predicted Kandahar governor Yusuf Pashtun. </p> <p>\"We have some evidence that they recently had some problems in recruitment. The trust of the younger Talibs (religious students) is becoming less and less,\" he told Reuters. </p> <p>But security analysts predict another spike in violence in the run-up to parliamentary elections scheduled for April.</p>",
  "<p>The Frieze Art Fair represents Britain's acceptance into the global art world. It is as if, from an art point of view, we are finally free of mad cow disease. All the cool galleries are setting up stall for this second edition in London's Regent's Park: Marian Goodman from New York, Galerie Daniel Buchholz from Cologne and Hauser and Wirth from Zurich. In such company, I feel like Bob Hoskins in The Long Good Friday, trying to reassure his American backers that London is going places while the IRA keeps blowing up his organisation in front of their eyes.</p> <p>The Frieze Art Fair is a celebration, an upbeat moment for London to congratulate itself on becoming one of the world's art capitals. But this follows an annus terribilis for British contemporary art. It was a disastrous year not because of the meaningless and arbitrary fact that a fire in an east London warehouse destroyed some important works from Charles Saatchi's collection, including Jake and Dinos Chapman's Hell, but - far more seriously - because of the emotions the incident licensed. These can best be described as glee, hilarity and hate: finally, many people seemed to feel Saatchi and Tracey Emin and everything they stood for were getting their comeuppance. Anyone who thought the opening of Tate Modern, the Turner prize and, now, the Frieze Art Fair, mean the British love new art has to think again.</p> <p>Britain is not free of mad cow disease. We have a long history of scepticism towards modernity and, under the surface, that atavism still blazes and boils. I am not sure if I would want it any other way when I consider what contemporary art gets up to when left to its own devices - say, at the Venice biennale - without the lurid tabloid hostility and middle class revulsion that used to keep British art uneasy and, therefore, young.</p> <p>The Frieze fair is an opportunity to see, experience and buy what is new in art. But what is that, exactly? Is it Emma Kay's subjective world histories, Aleksandra Mir's surreal happenings, Adam Chodzko's disruptive meetings, all of which are featured? And why do some of us crave it when so many others despise it?</p> <p>Western art has a far deeper tradition of newness than music or literature. This is worth stressing, because on both sides of the cultural divide between people who loathe and love \"contemporary art\", there are some extraordinary misunderstandings about how new the cult of the new actually is. In the 1960s, the conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth divided art into that made before and after Marcel Duchamp. He argued that the early 20th century dadaist who invented the ready-made and the dry, allegorical brain-art of the Large Glass (The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even) inaugurated a new, \"philosophical\" art.</p> <p>Whether you take Kosuth and \"conceptual art\" as your dividing mark, or Andy Warhol's silkscreen paintings, unin\ufb02ected films and (apparently) empty self-image, or Donald Judd's reticent objects, it is widely agreed that art changed for ever in the 1960s. It changed so much that it became something else.</p> <p>When I look at Carl Andre's Equivalent VIII, the two layers of neatly arranged bricks that were once - it seems a long time ago - the most controversial thing in the Tate Collection, and at a painting by Caravaggio, I am seeing two categorically distinct things.</p> <p>An artist 400 years ago would not have recognised Andre's bricks as art. But he would have had no problem at all recognising the logic that compels us to see bricks as art. The cult of the new was already in full swing in 1550, when Giorgio Vasari published The Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects. Vasari's history of the renaissance arrogantly and brutally praises the new and \"modern\" style he himself exemplifies as a painter, and has nothing but contempt for old styles - sneering at the gothic cathedrals we cherish, dismissing anyone in the least bit old-fashioned. So much of our own appetite for art that leaves the past behind is already there, in 1550, in Vasari.</p> <p>We expect far less novelty from theatre, opera or literature than we do from art. In those fields, the revolutions of early 20th century modernism have long since receded, and it tends to be understood by both audience and artist that formal innovation will always, ultimately, serve the same narrative or dramatic ends that excited William Shakespeare or Charles Dickens. In visual art alone, we assume that everything has changed utterly.</p> <p>Rembrandt is an ironing board and the Mona Lisa has a moustache. A Bruce Nauman video installation a cat chasing a mouse around a nocturnal studio has no discernible relationship with Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne - or, for that matter, with Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon. Martin Creed's The Lights Going On and Off cannot easily be seen as having anything in common with Monet's Impression: Sunrise.</p> <p>And yet the gulf that seems to exist between art before and after the 1960s is not as real as it looks. What we are actually dealing with is a specific instance of something far older and even unchanging - western culture's belief that visual art has an ability and obligation to provide it with new experiences and knowledge.</p> <p>In 1992, Damien Hirst put a shark in a tank. It didn't seem that new. A great fish swimming through green liquid, mouth open, was recognised as a source of horror and the sublime long before Duchamp replaced art with philosophy. In John Singleton Copley's 18th century history painting Watson and the Shark, in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, a shark very like Hirst's opens its horrible maw and speeds through dark harbour waters towards a man who has fallen overboard. Fear, perverse excitement, the proximity of death: Copley's painting shares the same emotional curiosity as Hirst's vitrine.</p> <p>The object that has come to de\ufb01ne - especially for its detractors - art in our time is, in fact, timeless, archaic even. Hirst's shark could as easily \ufb02oat in a mouldering cabinet of curiosities as in the Saatchi Gallery. It has the appeal of romantic art and gothic architecture. It is visceral, not cerebral; if it is an idea, it is a very primal idea, drenched in fear endorphins. All of Hirst's best art is like this - and he has been doing some of his best art recently. When you contemplate Adam and Eve Towards the End - his glassed-in world and hers, with male and female accoutrements, mirrors, soil, tobacco, all in a terrible mess - it is dread, not dry thought, that clutches you.</p> <p>Romanticism is the most denigrated of aesthetic movements. Romantic art, we are warned, is hysterical, excessive, pompous, even fascistic. But romanticism includes Tchaikovsky as well as Wagner. Hirst is a romantic artist. But if you can talk about a contemporary artist as a romantic, or an expressionist, or even an ironist, then all our assumptions about a fundamental division between old and new, art before and after conceptualism, are nonsense.</p> <p>In fact, what has changed are the rules we allow contemporary artists to work by. Once, the rules stipulated that an artist, to be recognised as new and, hence, important, must paint large-scale narratives - \"histories\" like Copley's painting of Watson and the Shark. Now, those rules associate the new and weighty with other things: video, performance. But really powerful and enduring art, whatever the rules happen to be, transcends them. Most 18th century paintings are historical curiosities, but Hogarth's March to Finchley explodes the conventions of history painting, just as Hirst's vitrines burst the confines minimalism. These works art mean something.</p> <p>There was a lot of art around the world in the early 1990s of which this could be said. Rachel Whiteread and Felix Gonzales-Torres, Gerhard Richter and Lucian Freud, Bill Viola and Susan Hiller, Richard Serra and Louise Bourgeois: the field was rich. All sorts of anxieties and releases made for an art that squared up to big themes - death, disease, memory - in serious, adult ways.</p> <p>That moment has long since passed. For a decade now, artists have reverted the rules. The rules are defined by curators, by magazines, by critics, by talk. The rules are not creative.</p> <p>Art can only become creative, can only become worthwhile, when it pushes past whatever regulatory system currently defines it, through a determination to encompass emotional life, social life, some kind of life.</p> <p>In its very obsession with death, the art of a decade ago had life. But so much art is now possessed by a terminal self-regard.</p> <p>There is so much style: paintings that are full of cute awareness of the silliness of painting; sculptures that can't get over the stupidity of making sculpture. There is performance art that re-enacts the history of performance art, artists who are curators and curators who think they are artists.</p> <p>Usually, in the recent history of art, assumptions that have seemed permanent, the wave of the future, have proved reversible almost overnight. Style provokes counter-style. Renaissance generates Mannerism and Baroque gives birth to Rococo. In the micro-histories of art since the 1960s, such transformations have happened twice in a decade.</p> <p>This time, nothing has happened. The vitality of art a decade ago has quite obviously dissipated. But nothing has taken its place: there is a mysterious stillness to the story of art, which seemed destined to eternal change. It is as if the rules have become so elastic, so sophisticated, they can encompass anything, so long as it has a sense of its own subordination to the larger picture, which is that galleries are cool places to be. So, instead of a strong reaction to the installations and casts and slowed films of decade ago, we have had a proliferation of weak reactions: jokey painting revivals, limp sculpture revivals, lo-\ufb01 videos. It's all so half-hearted. And yet it all passes as interesting.</p> <p>In the absence of exciting art, galleries are full of its mannered substitutes.</p> <p>Somehow this doesn't seem matter, to judge by the popularity of modern art museums. It's as if we enjoy the experience of these places and occasions above and beyond the art that the excuse for them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for every person who visits the Frieze fair, there are 10 more who have nothing but foaming contempt for the whole business of contemporary art.</p>",
  "Slaves found oil deep in the forests of the tiny west African island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 more than 200 years ago. In recent times, a company surveyed the bubbling pools of crude with a view to exploiting it, but concluded it was not possible. What the locals call the \"petrol mine\" near Uba Budo is now a rarely visited geological curiosity; for a few dollars, children will lead you down a slithery path to collect a bottle full of the \"black gold\" that drives the world. <p>Two hours' drive away, in the capital, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 city - a dozy, delightful place of a few thousand people where not much works - the smell of oil is becoming all-pervasive. A far more rewarding source has been discovered than the muddy hollow at Uba Budo. Three years ago, the world's largest oil company, ExxonMobil, found vast offshore deposits reckoned to be between 4bn and 10bn barrels. The first contracts have been awarded, and sooner or later the first $100m down payment will be paid to one of the most impoverished and indebted countries in the world. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, coupled with the even smaller island of Principe, straddling the equator, has won the geological lottery: a state the size of the Isle of Wight, with a population of just 150,000, could soon become the Qatar or Kuwait of Africa. Its people, mainly dirt-poor subsistence farmers, will theoretically be worth millions of dollars each within a generation. The interest alone on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's expected oil finds in a few years should repair its diabolical roads, pay off its $300m debt, wipe out its rampant malaria and rebuild its decrepit schools and hospitals. There could be so much money that no S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an need ever work again. </p> <p>In theory. But all leading economists know that when a poor country finds oil, it is more often a curse than a blessing. The history of all the other oil-producing countries in the region - Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, Chad, Cameroon - shows that sudden petro-wealth can swamp a poor country, rip apart its culture, divide its people, destabilise its governments, lead to massive corruption and human rights abuses, encourage coups and militarisation, and wreck the environment. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, a palm-fringed tropical island, is now a test case for oil companies and the world: will it be plundered and overwhelmed by the changes about to happen? Or could it, as many of the world's top economic and social advisers hope, avoid the paradox of plenty, become the only small, undeveloped country ever to have found oil in large quantities, shared the benefits equitably and guaranteed future generations sustainable development? </p> <p>To see what can happen when oil comes to a small nation, head to Malabo, the capital of only slightly larger Equatorial Guinea, which lies 300 miles to the north-east of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, close to Nigeria. Ten years ago, ExxonMobil found vast quantities of oil and gas in its waters, just as it has now done in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. Tiny Equatorial Guinea, split between the island of Santa Isabella - the former Spanish colony of Fernando Po - and a strip of mainland west Africa, now produces 440,000 barrels of oil a day, almost half the yield of Nigeria; within five years it will probably be Africa's second largest oil and gas producer, and one of America's largest providers. </p> <p>On one level, oil has been good for Equatorial Guinea. ExxonMobil, US oil giant Marathon and others have invested more than $3bn in a country of about 500,000 people. The average income is said to have grown to $5,000 a head from less than $500, the economy is growing by 65% a year - faster than anywhere else in the world - and the country has paid off its crippling $200m international debt. According to the International Monetary Fund, its income from oil and gas is about $1bn a year, but this is based on 1992 oil prices and output. It's more likely that Equatorial Guinea is currently earning $3bn a year from oil. </p> <p>This kind of wealth makes a little known, globally insignificant nation a target for every kind of investor, entrepreneur, political opportunist and freebooter. Oil has brought attempted coups, massive corruption, xenophobia and paranoia. There have been frequent coup attempts in Equatorial Guinea, but the most serious was last March, when 25 men, including South Africans and Germans, were arrested in Malabo for allegedly plotting to overthrow the president. The next day, a further 70 men, including Old Etonian Simon Mann, were arrested on a plane at Harare airport in Zimbabwe, en route, it was claimed, to Equatorial Guinea from South Africa. The men said they were going to act as guards for a mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p> <p>The government's theory, pieced together from prisoner statements, is that the two groups were going to meet in Malabo, kill the president and secure the city to allow an exiled Equatorial Guinean living in Spain to be installed as president. To add to the intrigue, the Spanish government and US officials are said to have known of the plot in advance. Sir Mark Thatcher has been detained in Cape Town pending another court hearing into whether he invested money in the coup attempt. Meanwhile, the men held in Zimbabwe have been tried for arms offences and been given sentences ranging from one to seven years. The trial of those arrested in Malabo is expected to re-open on Monday. </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea was a Spanish colony until 1968. After independence, a Marxist government held power until 1979 when Teodoro Obiang Nguema overthrew his uncle in a coup. Obiang has retained absolute power since presiding over his country's spectacular access to wealth. He has a reputation for a brutal way with political opponents, and from the evidence of a visit, he has done nothing to share out the oil riches fairly. </p> <p>Oil is changing Malabo fast. A new dual carriageway leads from a new airport into the capital, where new hotels are being built and glass-walled office blocks are springing up. But the city centre is quiet, edgy and almost empty. Within an hour of arrival in this strange little country without bookshops or tourists, two spies eavesdropped our conversation in a hotel, we were followed in the street by the army, special police and national police, informed on by a man standing at a corner, stopped at gunpoint, asked for our papers, and had a film confiscated. </p> <p>\"Who are you? Why are you here? Where is your permission? Nobody takes pictures here,\" shouted the nervous kid in fatigues waving his gun. </p> <p>The head of the UN development programme in Equatorial Guinea, Bacar Abdouroihamane, warned us, \"Beware, this place, it's dangerous. It is very extreme, a place of nightmares and miracles. Two years ago they only had a few hundred cars, no airport, nothing. Now there are some very full bank accounts. They have 50 ministers and 25 presidential advisers. They have been kept in deep poverty for 200 years. Now oil comes, they see light at the end of the tunnel. But the companies do not care what happens. Equatorial Guinea has the worst mosquitoes and malaria in the world, there is appalling poverty and many shadow places that no one wants you to see.\" </p> <p>That evening, sitting in the eerie orange light of \"the eternal flame\" - the gas-flaring from Marathon Oil's giant $1.8bn methane works being constructed outside Malabo - we met Madame Lucie Bourthemieux, a Paris-based Cameroonian lawyer acting as an adviser to the minister of justice. Mme Lucie was keen to defend the regime. \"There is a deep distrust of foreign powers here,\" she said. \"The president has a hatred of, almost an allergy to, the west, especially to Spain, which treated the country like dirt as a colony. It was left at independence with nothing, and run by a Marxist dictator until he took over. Democracy is young here. It may not actually be the most suitable method of politics. The president says that God wants him to build the country. He is sincere, very Catholic. He knows what poverty is, what it is to have no light or water.\" </p> <p>Equatorial Guinea, she said, had been ripped off by US oil companies from the moment oil was discovered. \"The companies struck a deal that left it with just 15% of the oil revenues. The president could do nothing. They took the lion's share. In front of the lion, what can the rabbit do? The lawyers involved in signing the first contracts were supposed to advise the country, but were working for the Americans. Today, if America doesn't like a president, it takes him out.\" The second problem, she said, was that oil had made Equatorial Guinea strategically important. \"It's now in the interests of many countries to try to destabilise us. We have no friends. Until oil came, no one was interested in us. Now everyone wants to steal our wealth.\" Equatorial Guinea's enemies, she said, were waging an intense propaganda war, spreading rumours and libels about the president. </p> <p>Over the next three days, Mme Lucie interrogated us regularly and had Guardian articles about the president sent to her from Paris. She objected strongly to reports from watchdog groups in Europe and the US that Obiang had profited handsomely from oil at the expense of human rights and the poor, and was furious that a political exile had been allowed to say that the president was \"a cannibal\" who \"eats human testicles\". \"How can the Guardian write that? It is so demeaning and insulting to an African head of state. You could never ever say that about Mr Blair,\" she thundered. </p> <p>\"This is a good place. You are welcome to talk to people,\" she said. But Malabo is almost the only city in Africa where no one, not even the children, want to talk and where people look around in fear or just walk away when you speak to them. By chance, we met Charles, a young man who was as anxious to show us Malabo as he was to leave it. </p> <p>We started the reality tour on the new motorway. \"The president and his family own all the land on either side for miles. That enormous house is the president's wife's hotel ... that's his brother-in-law's house ... this is his third son's ... this is the nephew's ... that is the house of his first wife,\" he said. Indeed, every new building of any size seemed to belong to the president or his family. </p> <p>All the US companies - ExxonMobil, Marathon, Halliburton, Chevron, Total - had refused to meet or talk to us, but we got to within 300 yards of some of their huge complexes, all built on more land owned by the president. Here we were stopped by armed guards demanding bribes. We turned back, past the golf course hacked out of virgin forest also owned by the president; the prefab city built by multinational Bechtel for the 4,000 Filipino construction workers shipped in to build Marathon's plant; the village flattened without compensation to make way for the companies; and the fortified ExxonMobil compound with its guardhouses, tennis courts, cinemas and canteens where even the tomatoes are flown in from America. </p> <p>\"The president and his family own everything. They earn many millions a year from the land he rents to the oil companies. The money goes straight out of the country. It's paid in dollars straight into secret accounts,\" said Charles. </p> <p>\"This is what oil brings,\" he continued as we drove past rows of new $1m houses built for oil executives, and huge houses bristling with satellite and radio masts lived in by ministers, government advisers and security chiefs. We headed up Chester E Norris Jnr avenue, an American-style suburb named after a US ambassador who was pulled out of Malabo in 1988. Less wealthy expats live here with their barbecues and basketball nets behind high fences. </p> <p>\"Now see how Equatorial Guineans live,\" said Charles. He headed to Newbuildings, an ocean of wooden shacks where about 30,000 people live in some of Africa's worst slums. There were six foot-high rubbish mountains, ponds of standing water infested with mosquitoes, broken drains and water pipes. \"Most people live without electricity. There is no sanitation. People are living in rubbish dumps. Everything is fucked here. We were promised a better world with oil, but we have nothing and now we live only in fear,\" said Charles. \"They have done nothing for health or for schools. The president and his family have all the money, the opportunities and the power. All power leads to him. He makes all the decisions. One family only lives well here.\" </p> <p>We continued the tour of downtown Malabo. \"This is where the prostitutes from Cameroon and Gambia have come to live. Oil has brought many bad people, bandits. This area was burned down twice this year ... People say that the ministers and the oilworkers brought Aids. There are many bars in the city for expats to pick up girls. Before, we were poor. Now, we are poor and raped,\" said Charles. \"Duck your head now. We must be careful no one sees you here .. People are afraid to talk. All we see now is more police and army. Petrol has brought only problems. Since it came, rents have more than doubled. All prices have risen.\" As he spoke, Obiang's two personal military helicopters flew overhead towards the airport. </p> <p>We asked to see the hospital, which was clean, orderly, staffed mostly by Cuban doctors. The hospital had a new wing and the babies slept under mosquito nets stamped with the ExxonMobil logo. Very quickly staff asked us to leave. That evening, however, we went back with 15-year-old Rico, whom we'd met in the street. He needed to have a festering wound on his thigh treated. We took him to the new wing where he was assessed by a doctor, treated and given antibiotics in less than 30 minutes for $3. </p> <p>\"But my family has nothing,\" said Rico, leading us to his house, a six foot-square wooden shed which he shared with his mother, baby sister and brother. None of the families in the large compound wanted to talk or have their picture taken. That evening a policeman followed us back to our hotel, sat down beside us and pointedly fiddled with his gun. </p> <p>For Anglo-Cameroonian businessman Patrick, the country is a nightmare place to work. \"Oil has made Equatorial Guinea a family business with 500,000 employees. Every business here must release a percentage of the company or pay a bribe, or both, to the president or one of his family. That generates huge amounts of dosh. It all goes straight offshore. You can do nothing without presidential support. The president has 17 children and the oldest drives a red Ferrari. The government demands that companies who come here build the roads or whatever. The country has been badly treated by everyone for years, so it's payback time now.\" He adds that 20 years ago Equatorial Guinea was so poor that it offered itself to neighbouring Cameroon for $1m. Cameroon refused. </p> <p>Political opposition has been muted and depressed since the recent elections overwhelmingly returned the government. There is notionally an opposition party, but Pio-Miguel Obama, general secretary of the socialist CPDS party, didn't want to be seen with us in public and said that, like many of his party, he had been in prison and tortured. </p> <p>\"This country is very rich now, but everything is concentrated to benefit the power of the president. No one knows how much oil money is coming in, not even the finance minister. It is not in the budget. The oil money goes to the president's accounts in Europe and the US. ExxonMobil is accused in the US of having paid $400m into his private account, but the company gives no information. </p> <p>\"They said that oil would bring jobs, but it's impossible to get a job with the companies. They employ only a few hundred people - the rest are temporary workers from the Philippines. The companies provide only a few mattresses, nets and beds for the hospital. Meanwhile, there is a huge network of spies who are paid to inform on people. Everyone here is a policeman.\" </p> <p>Two days later, having been refused interviews by the ministers of information, justice, security and tourism, we tried to leave but were dragged back from the airport departure lounge by a flustered Mme Lucie. \"You must not go,\" she implored us. \"The president knows you are here. He has ordered his personal political adviser, the man whom he is closest to, and the minister of justice, to meet you. It would be very unwise to leave.\" </p> <p>Their Excellencies Miguel Oyono Ndong Mifuno and Dr Ruben Maye Nsue were both angry. Both were relations of the president. Obiang's right-hand man dripped with gold, while Dr Nsue, the justice minister, educated in France, Spain and Geneva, was young, smart and charming. \"Why are you here?\" demanded Mifuno. \"Are you here to destabilise the country? Our security investigations say that you are engaged in an operation to discredit the country. Who is behind this? We have our ideas. You must apologise for your past mistakes.\" </p> <p>He added, more calmly: \"Oil here is a political resource. When we had none, no one was interested in us. Now everyone comes to take advantage of us. Our enemies say that the oil money goes only to the president. That is vulgar talk. What I know is that people here - everyone - has money or the facility to build his own house, or look for work. There are no secret or private accounts. Everything is accountable.\" </p> <p>He said that oil has brought global companies flocking to Malabo. \"They want to steal our wealth. They demand a percentage share of the oil. We say no. They want to build an airport the size of Frankfurt, we say no. They say that they want to make us a gift of sanitation and water, but it is not a gift. They want to build a new port, but they demand $200m to do the feasibility studies, so we say no ... We do not want five-star hotels. We only want development that is suitable for our people. I know the president well. He wants the best for his people. Soon Malabo 2 [a new administrative capital] will be built. Ten thousand houses will be built for the people.\" </p> <p>Q: Will they be given to poor people? </p> <p>A: No, they must buy them. </p> <p>Q: How? </p> <p>A: Everyone has money. </p> <p>Q: How much does the country earn from oil? </p> <p>A: You should ask the IMF. </p> <p>Q: What is your annual budget? </p> <p>A: [He telephones the minister of finance before answering.] $1bn. </p> <p>Q: How much is spent on health and education? </p> <p>A: 40% of the budget - $400m a year. </p> <p>Q: How much does the president and his family take from oil. What about his mansions in America? </p> <p>A: That is not an issue. </p> <p>But it is. The next day, the Washington Post reported that Riggs Bank in New York had agreed to pay $25m in fines for what US regulators called a \"wilful, systemic\" violation of anti-money-laundering laws. Regulators said the bank failed to report \"clearly suspicious transactions\", particularly ones connected to the embassy of Equatorial Guinea. </p> <p>In Malabo, it was President Obiang's 62nd birthday. The country's elite, about 100 people, went by Mercedes, Toyota and Buick to the cathedral. Obiang arrived last in a 12-car convoy of police and army vehicles from his palace 500 yards away. Six bodyguards ran alongside it holding handguns. No one else in Malabo was allowed within 300 yards. </p> <p>\"When people smell oil, they delude themselves. They go mad,\" said Patrick as we said goodbye. </p> <p>Oil financed 30 years of civil war in Angola. At least $30bn of oil money has been squandered or stolen in Nigeria and the Niger delta region, where it is found, is close to anarchy. In Chad, Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, oil money has led directly to governmental corruption, electoral fraud, environmental destruction, financial mismanagement and human rights abuses. Can tiny S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe do any better? </p> <p>The capital, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 city, has the pace and feel of a Caribbean island 30 years ago. Just three years ago it was neglected and broke. There were about 50 cars on the whole island and just one flight a week to the capital. The budget for the country was $25m a year - a quarter of the turnover of a London supermarket - and anyone who wanted to see the president could walk into the down-at-heel palace. Aid made up 80% of the country's income, it owed $300m and its economy was dictated by harsh IMF structural adjustment programmes. </p> <p>Not much has changed. The palace now has three guards, but chickens run around its grounds. The one TV channel regularly closes down because it cannot get spare parts. The power goes off most nights, there is no daily newspaper and goats walk the streets. The only token of the global economy is a Visa cash machine. However, there are many more cars, daily flights to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 from Europe - and a lot of smart lawyers, businessmen and soldiers in town. </p> <p>\"Oil will change everything very soon,\" says Colonel Eugene Michael Mensch, president of Consulting Africa Ltd, a recently retired US marine sent to conduct seminars on military/civilian relations with the government. He is part of an advance guard of Americans now regularly in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 to prepare it for the changes that oil and America demand. </p> <p>America's unstated but emerging policy is to turn S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 into a strategic regional base to protect its growing oil interests in the Gulf of Guinea. The region has an estimated 50bn barrels of oil reserves, and within 10 years is expected to provide 25% of US oil, more even than the Middle East. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is ideal. Unlike Equatorial Guinea, which the US State Department has labelled \"ruthless\" for its torture and incarceration of the opposition, it has a pro-west president, few people, a large Voice of America radio station and no anti-Americanism. </p> <p>To underline S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's new strategic importance, a full US military exercise was staged in its waters during the summer. Washington is paying $900m for feasibility studies on a new airport able to take the largest military aircraft, as well as a deep sea port large enough for its warships. Under the terms of the contract, both will have to be built by American companies. </p> <p>The US has other plans for S\u00e3o Tome. \"They've got 350 people in the army and no coastal defences. They don't know what is going on, or who is coming in, but oil money will bring drugs and illegal immigration. They're not at the point where they know if they need an air force. If you take the cynical view, you would say that the US is in it for the money, but we want to help them, too. They need to be ready,\" says the US military attach\u00e9 in Gabon. There are others wanting a stake in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, too. Brazil, France, South Africa, Nigeria, Portugal and Angola have all recently offered to \"help\" train and bankroll its army, police and coastguards. </p> <p>The international community was not there to lend a hand, however, when S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 made its most crucial decision: in 1997, an unknown, Houston-based Nigerian company called ERHC, which had never drilled a barrel of oil, offered just $5m for - and got - exclusive exploration rights to all S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's waters. It was described as one of the best - or worst - deals in history, and the World Bank declared it unfair. But no money was paid and the deal looked set to fall apart until Sir Emeka Offor, a Nigerian businessman closely associated with the late Nigerian dictator Sami Abacha - who stole an estimated $4bn when in power - bought ERHC, renamed it Chrome, brought in ExxonMobil, involved the Nigerian government and proposed a new agreement in return for lucrative concession rights. When Exxon struck oil, Chrome/ERHC became worth about $600m overnight. Nigeria then disputed S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's territorial limits. Fearing it would lose everything, desperate for cash, the then president caved in and agreed a 60:40 split in Nigeria's favour. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Chrome/ERHC and Exxon also negotiated preferential rights. By the time the first licences were bid for last November, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had effectively given away much of its oil-rich territory, handed a barely existent Nigerian company almost 20% of what was left, and given up most of its rights to down payments. However, November 23 2003 was still the greatest day in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9's uneventful history. Twenty companies bid a combined $506m for seven exploration blocks, leading the government to expect more than $200m in signature payments. So far, only one contract has been awarded, to ChevronTexaco. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans are now realising that they will see next to no money for many years. The first boreholes will be drilled next year, but the companies say oil will not flow until 2011. In another controversial deal, the companies negotiated the right to recoup their investments first, receiving 80% of all the oil money for the first five years of production. In other words, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 stands to make only 20% of a 40% share (8%) between 2011 and 2017. </p> <p>No one, least of all Fradique de Menezes, the half-Portuguese cocoa trader elected president in 2001, doubts that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will one day become rich. Fradique, as he is known everywhere, says that the country will get at least $500m a year from oil, more than 10 times its present annual income. But he, too, is accused of lining his pockets. On taking power, he was found to have secretly accepted $100,000 from EHRC/Chrome's chairman. Both parties said it was a legitimate election contribution. </p> <p>Fradique has had a torrid year. Last June he was flown to Washington to sit at President Bush's right hand with other African oil state leaders. Shortly after, while in Nigeria, he was ousted in a short bloodless coup by a small army group, backed by the \"Buffalo boys\" - S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an mercenaries who fought with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Eventually Nigeria negotiated a deal whereby the organisers of the coup agreed to hand back the islands on the promise of better conditions for the army. Oil may not have been the prime reason for the coup, but no one doubts it was in the background. </p> <p>\"I am optimistic but very afraid,\" says Chr\u00e9tien Lehombre, of the UN development programme that is trying to help S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 prepare for oil. According to a new UN report, unless the country prepares rapidly, it is certain to suffer \"resource curse\". This is a feature of all poor countries that depend for their income largely on one resource - be it diamonds, gold, timber, oil or gas, cacao or copper. </p> <p>Seven things usually happen when oil comes to a poor country, says the report. Prices rise; the government loses interest in everything else; officials become corrupt; multinational companies reward individuals via secret accounts; there is increased military spending; democracy is undermined; and prestige white elephant projects get built. </p> <p>\"Spending the money wisely is the biggest challenge S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will ever face,\" says Lehombre. \"So many mistakes have been made already in the initial contracts.\" In some ways, says Lehombre, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is enlightened. Last year the government hired experts from Alaska to advise on how to deal with windfall oil money and a UN special adviser has been working with young economists at Columbia university to draw up a model oil law, which, if passed, will ensure that neither government nor president can squander or steal the oil money. \"The broad principles have been agreed by parliament,\" says Lehombre. </p> <p>According to others who have seen the draft law, it also states that the government can increase annual spending by only 20% a year, with the amount it takes from the oil fund dropping 2% a year until, after 10 years, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 must live on the interest alone - expected to be at least $50m a year. One anomaly is that Principe, with only 5,000 people, is to get 10% of the money, the equivalent of an English village having several billion pounds in the bank and earning at least $5m a year. </p> <p>The fear is that President de Menezes will refuse to sign up. Last year, parliament tried to change the constitution to reduce his powers. He dismissed parliament. \"The law will limit the risks, and the amount that can be injected into the economy, but then look at all the aid that has come to the country in the past 20 years. Officially, it was $30-35m a year. Where did that go? That's the reality check,\" says Lehombre. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of rural S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans barely believe there is life beyond the plantations. The island was a Portuguese colony until 1975 and the prime source of income has always been cocoa. \"I just don't know if oil will bring a better life than this,\" says Ricardo Toakares, who lives in the crumbling, colonnaded grandeur of the old Mille Flores cocoa estate. More than 100 families live in its marble-floored rooms, stables, workshops and kitchens. There are fires on the balconies, dogs on the verandas and what once must have been lawns are covered in washing. </p> <p>\"We have very little money. We live on bananas and cocoa, and sell fruit to the town. There's not enough food, we need to repair the school and we need houses and work. The malaria here is terrible. A doctor comes every Tuesday but we have no drugs. It all depends on the government. Maybe things will change. After all, we do not need very much, just decent jobs and a better standard of life. It could be wonderful here. But we have a saying: 'The president drinks with a cup, the rich with a spoon and the poor with a fork.'\" </p> <p>The S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 elite already has grand ideas. \"I see S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 as a Singapore or a Hong Kong,\" says businessman Tony Aguire, who chairs the committee set up to manage the new airport and port studies. \"We see it setting up a free trade zone, becoming a transit and storage place for the region, with shops, hotels, duty-free zones for oilworkers, providing logistical support for the oil companies, a private healthcare centre for rich people in the region ...\" </p> <p>Carlos Tiny, a former presidential candidate, gives his verdict: \"It will be heaven, hell or purgatory, depending on the choices made.\"</p>",

  "Edinburgh is gearing up for a city-wide battle over congestion charges as a public inquiry into the controversial traffic tolls is poised to recommend their introduction in the Scottish capital. <p>The findings of a 10-week investigation into the city's transport plan, which began in April, are due to be unveiled later this month. </p> <p>But a source close to the inquiry has told the Guardian it will recommend congestion charges. \"I don't think there are any doubts on that,\" the source said. </p> <p>The report will pave the way for a referendum on the charges. Under plans drawn up by the city council, which are expected to be approved by the executive, Edinburgh residents will be given the opportunity to vote in February on whether they want the controversial tolls. </p> <p>It will be the first time in Britain ordinary motorists will have been given the chance to vote directly on whether they are prepared to accept congestion charges in order to protect the environment. </p> <p>Although environmental groups say surveys have shown that traffic charging schemes have found favour with Londoners - with polls showing opposition dropping from 40% to 27% - and the residents of Durham, they admit that persuading drivers to vote for them will be an uphill task. </p> <p>\"It is going to be very difficult,\" said Dan Barlow, the head of research at Friends of the Earth Scotland. \"The council is obviously going to have a job to do to convince the majority that they will directly benefit from the charge.\" </p> <p>The Labour-dominated Edinburgh city council has been in favour of introducing congestion charges for almost a decade. </p> <p>It wants two congestion zones, one covering the city centre and the other the suburbs up to the boundary of the city. </p> <p>The radical Edinburgh proposals would mean that anyone entering the city during the designated congestion hours would have to pay a \u00a32 toll. It would be the first time anywhere in the world that an entire city is covered by a congestion charge. </p> <p>\"This scheme is unique,\" said Neil Greig, the head of policy at AA Scotland. </p> <p>\"If you replicated the London scheme in Edinburgh it would basically cover Princes Street, but these proposals take in the entire city and suburbs. It means that people in areas where public transport is not a realistic solution will be punished. </p> <p>\"We have no problem with the overall concept of charging, but we have major reservations about this scheme.\" </p> <p>Even those who oppose the introduction of the congestion charge in Edinburgh do not dispute the environmental arguments. </p> <p>\"People think that the Tories don't want any form of congestion charge but that's just not true,\" said Allan Jackson, the city's Conservative transport spokesman. \"We just don't want this ridiculous one. </p> <p>\"It is the commuter that we should be targeting, not the people who come into Edinburgh to shop and not the people who live here. </p> <p>\"Edinburgh city council may be a Labour cabal, but most folk in Edinburgh didn't vote for them and they will get hammered in the referendum,\" he said. </p> <p>The London congestion charge has had a positive impact on the city's environment. Since the toll was introduced last February, there has been a 16% drop in exhaust fumes and carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by 19%. </p> <p>The number of traffic accidents resulting in injury has also fallen by 25% in the charging zone. </p> <p>\"The environmental arguments are obviously extremely persuasive,\" said Steve Hounsham of the campaign group Transport 2000. </p> <p>\"But no one is pretending that persuading people to vote for congestion charges will be easy. The council really has to show them the whole picture of the benefits of reduced traffic and better public transport in the city.\" </p> <p>The council's transport package is radical: \u00a3160m investment by 2006, one of the largest network of bus lanes in Europe and three new railways stations are the carrots to go with the congestion charge stick. </p> <p>Andrew Burns, the council's executive transport member, believes that when residents see the whole package they will vote yes in the referendum. \"I don't want to pre-empt the public inquiry, but I am confident people can be persuaded to vote for the charges,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have had a 50% increase in traffic in Edinburgh over the last 20 years, with another 50% predicted for the following 20 years. We live in a world heritage site and people can see the damage traffic is doing. When people see the overall plan, I'm confident a referendum would go our way.\"</p>",

  "Gordon Brown prompted an angry response from Brussels yesterday when he attacked Europe's aid policy as \"nonsensical\" and called for the focus of development strategy to be switched from the Balkans to Africa and Asia. <p>Speaking at a gathering of British aid charities in Lon don, the chancellor urged the European commission to boost spending to poor countries by \u20ac1bn (\u00a3600m) a year.</p> <p>Mr Brown said reform of the EU aid budget was crucial, with only 45% of the budget between 1999 and 2002 spent in countries where poverty was most acute.</p> <p>\"It is nonsensical that less than 50% of European Union development assistance is be ing spent in low income countries and that more than \u20ac28 per head is being spent in well-resourced middle income regions like the western Balkans when Africa receives only \u20ac3.17 per head and Asia, where most of the world's poor live, is receiving only around \u20ac0.30 per head.</p> <p>The chancellor told Bond (British overseas NGOs for development) that he wanted to see 70% of the EU aid budget directed to low-income countries, a figure not reached since the early 1990s.</p> <p>Chris Patten, European commissioner for external relations, hit back at the chancellor, saying: \"Mr Brown is not the first British minister to fail to compare like with like in taking an opportunistic swipe at the spending of EU aid in third world countries.</p> <p>\"The commission's record in providing development assistance to alleviate poverty in the poorest countries in the world compares well with other European and international donors.</p> <p>\"This is separate from the very significant resources that, with the full support of member states including the UK, we spend in promoting security and stability, particularly in our immediate neighbourhood.</p> <p>\"Listening to Jack Straw, I do not believe that it is UK government policy that we should pull out of much needed assistance in bringing peace to the Balkans, keeping the Palestinian Authority afloat, or contributing to the reconstruction of Iraq.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown also called on the commission to back his plan to float government-backed bonds on the world's capital markets. Britain's proposed International Finance Facility envisages a doubling of global aid to $100bn (\u00a356bn) a year, but so far has found only a limited number of backers.</p> <p>The chancellor said that if Brussels committed \u20ac1bn to the IFF it could leverage up to \u20ac2bn a year from 2006 on hitting the 2015 goals of halving global poverty, cutting infant mortality by one third and putting every child in primary school.</p> <p>\"I ask you to use your moral authority to urge other governments and the EU to agree to take upon themselves their share of multilateral debt so that the poorest countries in the world can look forward to a future free of the shackles of debt,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The biggest shakeup of NHS pay and conditions since the health service was founded in 1948 got the green light yesterday when leaders of the public service union Unison gave it their support. </p> <p>After months of wrangling, delegates at a special meeting in London agreed to recommend the Agenda for Change proposals to their 450,000 health members. The results of a ballot will be declared on November 8.</p> <p>The deal, affecting about a million staff including nurses, therapists and support workers, was designed to eliminate outmoded demarcations, promote career progression, and relate pay more fairly to work being done.</p> <p>But there had been concern in Unison that some of the lowest paid workers might end up worse off. It deferred a decision on the package when nurses and other groups gave it their support last year.</p> <p>John Reid, the health sec-retary, offered a sweetener during the Labour conference last week when he promised to tackle the MRSA superbug by getting rid of hospital cleaning contracts that undercut the standard union rates. Before the Unison meeting yesterday the health minister John Hutton gave the plan a further boost by offering \u00a330m to encourage NHS organisations to release union representatives to help implement it .</p> <p>Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said: \"At the heart of this package will be a new minimum wage in the NHS of \u00a311,135. That is a great breakthrough.\"</p> <p>\u0095 NHS employers last night appointed Sue Slipman, a former National Union of Students leader, as the director of the NHS Confederation's foundation trust network.</p>",
  "It might not boast the cachet of staying at the Ritz or Savoy, but 5,000 backpackers will be bedding down at one of the most exclusive addresses in London next week, turning the Millennium Dome into the world's biggest youth hostel. <p>The much-mocked attraction is to be turned into a dormitory for thousands of activists and young people travelling from across the continent for the European Social Forum. </p> <p>Like many of the capital's residents, the mayor appears surprised - or perhaps just relieved - that someone has found a use for the great white elephant of Greenwich. </p> <p>\"I have always considered the dome to be one of London's most beautiful structures and I knew it would be very useful at some point,\" Ken Livingstone said yesterday. </p> <p>\"Those who stay there will take back a view of London they will never forget.\" </p> <p>There will be plenty of room for delegates from the \"global justice\" conference to unfurl their sleeping bags in the dome, which covers an area the size of eight football pitches. Its contents were auctioned off after its closure, but toilets remain and temporary showers will be installed. </p> <p>The mayor's office said it could not discuss the cost of the scheme as it was still in negotiations with English Partnerships, the agency overseeing the dome. </p> <p>The fee is likely to run well into six figures, but should be covered by a \u00a310 accommodation charge and the \u00a325 fee for affiliation to the conference. </p> <p>The Greater London authority has already arranged free travel passes for delegates and has given \u00a3400,000 to the forum from existing budgets. </p> <p>The four-day event is believed to be the largest conference to take place in London. Organisers predict that around 20,000 individuals and delegates from trade unions, charities and community groups will attend hundreds of seminars and workshops. </p> <p>It opens next Thursday, when speakers, including Mr Livingstone, Gerry Adams and Aleida Guevara, Che Guevara's daughter, will address a rally at Southwark cathedral.

  "<p>The Norwegian Nobel committee has decided to award the Nobel peace prize for 2004 to Wangari Maathai for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.</p> <p> Peace on earth depends on our ability to secure our living environment. Maathai stands at the front of the fight to promote ecologically viable social, economic and cultural development in Kenya and in Africa. She has taken a holistic approach to sustainable development that embraces democracy, human rights and women's rights in particular. She thinks globally and acts locally. </p> <p>Maathai stood up courageously against the former oppressive regime in Kenya. Her unique forms of action have contributed to drawing attention to political oppression - nationally and internationally. She has served as inspiration for many in the fight for democratic rights and has especially encouraged women to better their situation. </p> <p>Maathai combines science, social commitment and active politics. More than simply protecting the existing environment, her strategy is to secure and strengthen the very basis for ecologically sustainable development. She founded the Green Belt Movement where, for nearly 30 years, she has mobilised poor women to plant 30 million trees. </p> <p>Her methods have been adopted by other countries as well. We are all witness to how deforestation and forest loss have led to desertification in Africa and threatened many other regions of the world - in Europe too. Protecting forests against desertification is a vital factor in the struggle to strengthen the living environment of our common Earth. </p> <p>Through education, family planning, nutrition and the fight against corruption, the Green Belt movement has paved the way for development at grassroot level. We believe that Maathai is a strong voice speaking for the best forces in Africa to promote peace and good living conditions on that continent. </p> <p>Wangari Maathai will be the first woman from Africa to be honoured with the Nobel peace prize. She will also be the first African from the vast area between South Africa and Egypt to be awarded the prize. She represents an example and a source of inspiration for everyone in Africa fighting for sustainable development, democracy and peace.</p>",
  "<p>Fifa Football 2004 was EA Sports' nadir. Its chief innovation was an unusable \"after-touch\" gimmick, which it spent so long developing it was not finished properly in time for release. So fundamental features, such as the ability to alter the game's speed, were omitted. </p> <p>Happily, this year's effort is much better - although not good enough to reclaim top spot. The after-touch control has been ripped out and a more useful first-touch control, operated using the right analogue stick, installed. </p> <p>Excellent graphics, an improved, more realistic passing system, a free-kick system that operates in a logical manner and a Pro Evolution Soccer-like press-and-hold shooting system constitute the game's highlights. There is also support for online play across all platforms now that EA has begun to support Xbox Live. </p> <p>A career mode, in which you take the reins of a lowly club and work your way up to the Premiership, or favourite global league, is an intriguing addition, but controlling players who would be more at home on Hackney Marshes proves frustrating. </p> <p>However, there are still areas in which Pro Evolution Soccer remains superior - namely, off-the-ball player movement when going forward, and automatic player selection. This year's Pro Evolution Soccer will also be available for the Xbox. Fifa Football 2005 marks a return to form, but it is no undisputed world-beater.</p>",
  "<p>Children as young as nine have more manufactured chemicals in their blood than their grandparents and these substances are suspected of disrupting development and hormones, according to tests on seven volunteer families across the country. </p> <p>Eighty manufactured chemicals were detected in blood tests for 104 substances on 33 people. Children were found to have 75 in their blood, as did their parents, but their grandmothers only had 56. The children also had higher concentrations of some chemicals. </p> <p>The substances tested for are known to be building up in the environment and include brominated flame retardants used in furniture and televisions, and perfluorinated chemicals used in the manufacture of non-stick pans and stain resistant treatments for carpets and clothing. </p> <p>A campaign to restrict the use of chemicals which accumulate in the blood - backed by the WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature), the Women's Institute and the Co-operative bank - is trying to get the European Union to toughen its stance. </p> <p>Justin Woolford, WWF's chemicals and health campaign director, said: \"These results are extremely worrying because of the unknown long-term health effects of the majority of industrial chemicals people are exposed to. The contamination of three generations of UK families ... illustrates that industry and government have failed to control these chemicals. The UK and the European Union must ... ensure that these chemicals are banned and replaced with safer alternatives.\" </p> <p>Eighty-two per cent of the people tested had at least one perfluorinated chemical in their blood; DEHP, which is a suspected hormone-disrupting chemical used in plastics, PVC flooring, food packaging and toiletries was found in more than 75%. </p> <p>Chemicals such as PCBs and DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, were found in everyone despite being banned in the UK at least a decade before the children were born, but on average the older generations had higher concentrations. </p> <p>BDE, a brominated flame retardant, was found in seven people in the survey, most of whom were children. </p> <p>The families tested were from Edinburgh, Welshpool, Manchester, Stourport, Gloucester, south Devon and Suffolk. </p> <p>Kate Daley, campaigns manager for the Co-operative bank, said: \"For most parents their child's health and well being is paramount, but sadly our latest research reveals that our children are being contaminated ... there is little we can do to prevent it. We want to see chemicals like these phased out and replaced with safer alternatives before it's too late.\" </p> <p>More than 60 leading independent scientists have signed a declaration calling for measures to reduce exposure to persistent and very bioaccumulative chemicals, and hormone or endocrine disrupting chemicals. </p> <p>The Co-operative bank refuses to invest in companies that \"manufacture chemicals which are persistent in the environment and linked to long term health concerns\". </p> <p>The report, called Contaminated: the next generation, showed connections between the products used by and the diets of those surveyed and the chemicals detected in their blood. </p> <p>For example, it is widely accepted that oily fish contains high levels of PCBs. The highest numbers of these chemicals were found in family members whose diets are high in such foods. </p> <p>Other studies have shown a correlation between the number of electrical appliances in an office and the levels of flame-retardant chemicals in the office air. </p> <p>This may help explain how people become contaminated by these chemicals, the study said.</p>",
  "<p>Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmentalist, today became the first African woman to win the Nobel peace prize.</p> <p>Ms Maathai, 64, Kenya's deputy environment minister, heads the Green Belt movement, a group that has planted 30m trees in Africa to help protect the environment. She says decades of excess have left just 1.7% of her native country with tree cover.</p> <p>Such was Ms Maathai's excitement at winning the 10m Swedish crown (\u00a3800,000) prize that she failed to keep the news under wraps until the official declaration. Fifteen minutes before the announcement was made in Oslo, at 10am UK time, she alerted journalists to her victory.</p> <p>\"I've just heard from the ambassador of Norway three minutes ago that I have won,\" she said. \"I am very excited. I really don't know what to say.\"</p> <p>Ole Danbolt Mjoes, the leader of the five-member Norwegian Nobel committee, had previously declined to give any hints. Despite the record field of 194 candidates, he told Norwegian radio shortly before the announcement: \"I can't say it has been more difficult this year than before.\" </p> <p>\"I am absolutely overwhelmed and very emotionally charged, really. I did not expect this,\" Ms Maathai told Norwegian state television once her award had been made official. </p> <p>Fighting back tears, she said: \"The environment is very important in the aspects of peace because when we destroy our resources and our resources become scarce, we fight over that. I am working to make sure we don't only protect the environment, but we also improve governance.\"</p> <p>Ms Maathai was the first woman from east and central Africa to obtain a doctorate, after earning a degree in biological sciences from Mount St Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas, in 1964. As well as fighting for environmental conservation, she and Green Belt have been internationally recognised for the struggle for democracy and human rights.</p> <p>A Kenyan government spokesman, Alfred Mutua, said: \"As a country we're greatly honoured. This is a great moment in Kenyan history. To us this shows that what Wangari Maathai has been doing here has been recognised. We're very proud of her and she deserves all the credit.\" </p> <p>Of the 194 nominees, the UN International Atomic Energy Agency and its head Mohamed El Baradei had been many pundits' favourite to scoop the prize. Ms Maathai was not even considered to have been in the running until Norway's NRK public television, which has often predicted the winner, said the prize might go to an environmentalist. </p> <p>Centrebet, an Australian website that offered odds on the prize, favoured the IAEA and Mr El Baradei at 4/1, following its recent work to stem nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Iran and Iraq. US senator Richard Lugar and former senator Sam Nunn were quoted at 6/1, for their work dismantling ageing Soviet nuclear warheads.</p> <p>A South African Aids pressure group and its leader, Zackie Achmat, were quoted at 7/1, as were Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalyov and Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu. No odds appeared to have been offered for Ms Maathai.</p> <p>Although the first African woman to win the prize since it was first awarded in 1901, Ms Maathai is the second female winner in a row, after Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi took the award last year. </p> <p>Six Africans had previously won the prize, including UN secretary general Kofi Annan, who shared it with the UN in 2001, and Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk, who shared it in 1993.</p> <p>Ms Maathai's win comes after Geir Lundestad, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, hinted in 2001 that the award might shift focus in its second century to honour new types of activists such as environmentalists, rock stars, and perhaps even journalists.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 9 2004</strong> </p> <p>East Timor was colonised by the Portuguese and not the Dutch, as we mistakenly say below. </p> <p>  </p> <p> Newspaper headlines are generally designed to terrify the public while the journalists who concoct them remain indifferent. But a story yesterday had the opposite effect; readers shrugged and turned the page while reporters everywhere spluttered on their pints, skipped breakfast and dashed straight to work. \"The outsourcing of journalism,\" declared the Guardian, as the news agency Reuters began shifting its financial coverage to Bangalore. \"This is an outrage!\" said Telegraph leader-writers, who'd just finished an editorial about how British workers must accept pay cuts to compete with call centres in India. \"These Asians...\" ranted the Daily Star hacks - \"they stay over there, and take our jobs!\" </p> <p>Reuters journalists had been writing for some time about how cost-efficient it might be for corporations to take advantage of India's highly educated workforce. At least now they know that their bosses bother to read their stuff. \"Breaking news will continue to be reported from the world's financial centres,\" wrote the media company's press secretary, struggling with the two removal men who were carrying out his desk. \"Journalists miles away from the actual stories?\" exclaimed one outraged cub reporter. \"How will they check for mistakes?\" At which point the entire newsroom looked at him with one eyebrow raised and he was quietly shown the door. </p> <p>Without anyone realising, this has been happening in local newspapers for some time. Trainee journalists in India get to their computers at 8am and by lunchtime have produced all the news stories that you read in your local freesheet. The template is straightforward; the software prompts the operator to make a series of simple choices to create a typical local news report... \"Pensioner mugged for only 10p/50p/\u00a31.20 (delete accordingly). \"A cowardly attack on a local pensioner was carried out in broad daylight/in the park/in this court report I just read/earlier this week. The attacker was wearing a bomber jacket and jeans/a hooded top and trainers/and fled the scene with only ... p (insert pitiful amount here). Police said this was a particularly despicable/shocking/vague/story and are warning pensioners to take extra care/stay inside/not to read their local newspaper and live in permanent terror.\" </p> <p>To balance up this routinely depressing item the would-be journalists are then presented with heart-warming reports such as \"Hospice Hero Cycling to Scotland!\" and \"Brownies Cake Sale Takes the Biscuit!\" to put above \"notice of planning application for new conservatory\". Then they just press \"send\" on their computer and the next day four copies of the local advertiser are pushed through your door. </p> <p>But now the software has been refined so that Indian computer operators can write the stories for British national newspapers too. The subject matter differs according to which newspaper the journalist writes for. Click on the Daily Mail icon and you get the headline \"Asylum Seekers Threat to House Prices\", and the piece pretty well writes itself from there - although the software prevents you deleting the words \"mother of two\", \"fear\" and \"Islamic extremists\". Click on the Sun and you get: \"It's Christine Agui-Leera!\" You just have to write the caption for a photo of an attractive young singer with a low-cut dress and faulty bra. </p> <p>Soon, London will be full of unemployed journalists, Fleet Street's finest former wordsmiths holding up cardboard signs saying \"hungrey and homless - plese halp\". And the placards of the Murdoch crew will include a plug for what's on Sky that night. </p> <p>But this is payback time for centuries of colonisation. Britain occupied India, imposed the English language and left the country significantly poorer, so that 200 years later it is cheaper to get Indians to compile our crosswords and review the new Dido album. Some former colonies are in a better position than others. \"Right,\" says the finance minister of East Timor, \"we're setting up an online news agency.\" </p> <p>\"But we were colonised by Holland. I'm afraid there's not much call for Dutch financial journalism.\" </p> <p>\"Even in the Netherlands?\" </p> <p>\"Nope, they speak better English than the Americans.\" </p> <p>Unless of course this is an elaborate plan to halt immigration. The presumption was always that third world workers hoped to come and work in the paradise that was Europe or America. Give them a few months of learning about the sort of newspapers we read and they'll all be saying: \"Er, actually, I think I'll stay right here, thank you very much.\" </p> <p>Although this column will continue to be credited to John O'Farrell it has now been outsourced to topical comedy writers in southern India. No discernible change in standard is anticipated. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 9 2004</b> <br> We inadvertently changed the nationalities of Barry Burns and the band Mogwai in the feature below on Welsh identity. Burns is Scottish and the band is from Glasgow. <p>Before taking the train from Paddington station in London for Cardiff earlier this week, I thought it would be nice to buy a Welsh newspaper and a guidebook to Cool Cymru. I wanted to get some in-train insight into that proud nation of footballer Ryan Giggs, movie star Catherine Zeta-Jones, clothes designer Julien Macdonald, rappers Goldie Lookin Chain and, to a lesser extent, Rhys Ifans and Huw Edwards. Not to mention my own ancestors. Some hope. It proved very easy to buy a copy of the Scottish newspaper the Herald. Easy, too, to pick up a guidebook to Scotland. No matter that trains do not go north of the border from Paddington. No matter that the station's departure boards suggest that lots of trains go to that forgotten land that allegedly starts where Shropshire gives up. </p> <p>Maybe, I thought, as the train left Bristol Parkway and headed through the Severn Tunnel, those departure boards lied. Perhaps they were lures into a land that doesn't really exist. Evidence for this thesis came on Tuesday, when The Eurostat Yearbook 2004 was published by the EU. It had a picture of Europe on the cover. Only one problem: Wales wasn't on it. Some 2.9 million people had fallen into the Irish Sea. The Western Mail, the national newspaper of Wales, printed a handy dot-to-dot map of Wales for Euro map-makers to cut out and keep for future reference. </p> <p>Wales, you might be forgiven for thinking, is the land fated to be ignored. Alone among the home countries, for instance, it doesn't feature on the union flag. The Western Mail leader yesterday put it this way: \"Blanking Wales from the map reminds us of Stalin's habit of removing his enemies from group photographs.\" </p> <p>Steady on, boyos - it was probably just a slip of a Eurocrat's computer keyboard. This Stalinist analysis, you might think (if you were English), typifies Welsh chippiness. Surely the Welsh would do well to develop a thicker skin. There is no plot against Wales; just an amnesia brought on by the insignificance of the nation's contribution to an irksomely anglophiliac world. I put this hypothesis to a group of young people in a pub called Y Mochyn Du (Black Pig) in Cardiff's Sophia Gardens district, and, surprisingly, was not punched into oblivion. </p> <p>In Y Mochyn Du, where men and women meet to converse in Welsh, Huw Hughes asked me a rhetorical question: \"Why are the Welsh so chippy? Because when I go into a supermarket in Bangor there is a sign advertising football shirts that says 'Support your local team', meaning the England football team. Why am I so chippy? Because my daughter asks if she can have a David Beckham shirt.\" </p> <p>Huw Hughes (\"I know it sounds unlikely, but I was the seventh of the children and maybe they'd run out of names\") works on sustainable development for Environment Wales. He isn't so much angry as disappointed about this English cultural colonialism, particularly in the run-up to tomorrow's World Cup qualifier at Old Trafford between England and Wales. \"One of the great hopes I have for the United Kingdom is that it will be genuinely pluralistic. The UK should be able to nurture a minority culture like Welsh rather than obliterate it.\" </p> <p>His friend Eifion Williams, a former Labour parliamentary candidate who is establishing a community recycling network in Wales, had another gripe. \"BBC News has had several reports on the minutiae of Sven's team's preparations for the game. So given that the BBC is supposed to represent the UK, you would expect them to have lots about Mark Hughes's preparations with the Welsh team. But no.\" </p> <p>Huw, Eifion and their friend Elaine all eagerly want Wales to win, though they fear they won't. \"I reckon it will be 2-2,\" says Huw. </p> <p>Not as optimistic as Bryn Terfel, the great Welsh bass-baritone who is currently rehearsing Don Giovanni in Chicago, then: \"I'm keenly hoping we can start with a win,\" he says when I phone him later. \"Old Trafford is the home to my favourite team, the mighty reds. On Saturday it'll be home to another set of mighty reds. I think this could be a powerful omen.\" </p> <p>Rhodri Morgan, Wales's first minister, is worried that the team's away record is not good enough. \"It's the David and Goliath thing, though - the Welsh love to see themselves as David slaying an England that is 17 times bigger than Wales. I'm not sure if it will happen this time. But ever since the 1870s, when international sporting events like these really started, a great deal of Welsh pride has been invested in sporting achievements over the English, in rugby, obviously, but also in football. </p> <p>\"It used to drive Lloyd George to distraction. He was a member of the Liberal wing called Cymru Fydd (Wales Will Be) that campaigned for Irish and Welsh devolution together. But he could never grasp the industrial psychology of the South Wales workers who cared more about beating England than winning home rule.\" </p> <p>Does the same apply today? \"No. I think we're trying in Wales to do two things: political evolution and sporting success, in tandem. I don't think that means we'll necessarily win, though.\" </p> <p>Other Welsh people are more aggressively anti-English. When, for instance, England played Croatia in the European Championships earlier this year, multi-instrumentalist Barry Burns, on tour in Zagreb with his band Mogwai, told the Croatian media: \"I'd love Croatia to beat England. Please destroy the bastards.\" Burns could not be contacted to express his hopes this time, but they may well have been unprintable. </p> <p>Anti-English sentiment has always existed in Wales. But a national self-confidence that had been made seemingly absurd by the mid-20th century attacks - first of Dylan Thomas in Under Milk Wood and then Kingsley Amis in The Old Devils - has renewed itself more recently. When Catatonia's Cerys Matthews sang that every morning when she woke up she thanked the Lord she was Welsh, it may not have played well on the other side of Offa's Dyke, but it reflected a growing mood, and one that was not utterly dependent on sporting achievement. </p> <p>It has also been buoyed up by devolution, the growth in Welsh language learning, the international success of Welsh bands such as the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals, and the opening of the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. It will be further boosted next month when the marvellous slate, steel and glass Millennium Centre cultural complex at Cardiff Bay opens in two gala concerts under the creative leadership of Terfel. Gone are the memories of the shabby way Zaha Hadid's Cardiff opera house plans were dismissed; now something called Cool Cymru is thriving as never before. </p> <p>This growing mood of national pride has occasionally faltered. The establishment of the Welsh Assembly in 1997, the first political assembly since Owain Glyndwr disappeared in 1406, followed a referendum in which the majority in favour of devolution was only 7,000. Political debate in the chamber was often derided as inane and circumlocutious. Perhaps members were falling to that supposedly common Welsh ailment, Kinnockian windbaggery. \"It has been an effective assembly,\" counters Morgan. \"Since Labour came to power in 1999, unemployment, which was much higher in Wales than the UK, is now lower. Infant mortality rates are lower, GCSE A to C grades are higher. These simple facts show the assembly has been worthwhile.\" </p> <p>\"I think things have moved on in the past few years and now a lot of the Cool Cymru ethos is about pride in the assembly,\" says Janet Ryder, a Plaid Cymru assembly member for North Wales. \"There's a real sense that we can stand on our own two feet. I don't think you'd find any people in Wales now who would want the assembly to be scrapped. Rather, I think a lot of people want our powers to be extended. They want us to take charge of all areas of education, of the police and ambulance services and not just the fire brigade.\" </p> <p>This week, members started to debate the Richard Commission report on whether the Welsh assembly should have more legislative powers and thus become akin to the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. \"The key resistance to that is from a fear of the diminution of Welsh MPs' powers in Westminster,\" says Ryder. \"They've seen what happened in Scotland and I'm sure they would feel like turkeys voting for Christmas in backing it.\" </p> <p>The sensibilities of Westminster turkeys notwithstanding, perhaps now is the time for Wales to self-confidently take charge of its own destiny and wield real political power for the first time in 700 years. After all, the giddy pomp of the Cardiff Bay redevelopment will come to a climax next year when Richard Rogers' new assembly building opens. </p> <p>But Cool Cymru was never even principally about devolution. It had a linguistic tenor unimagined in the philosophy of its big-headed big brother, Cool Britannia. In 1982 a Plaid Cymru campaign that included a hunger strike by MP Gwynfor Evans led to the Conservative government redeeming its election pledge to establish S4C, the Welsh-medium TV channel. Enthusiasm for learning Welsh grew during the rest of the decade. Welsh-medium schools opened and thrived. Now 20% of the country speaks the language - still overwhelmingly in the north-west. </p> <p>Of course, during those two decades the extraction of black gold from the South Wales valleys ended, to be replaced by the ingestion of drugs as well as soaring unemployment, but let's not spoil the story. The nurturing of the Welsh language, when the other Celtic tongues that were once widely spoken across the British Isles survive hardly at all, is a great source of Welsh pride. </p> <p>\"When we came to North Wales from England in 1989,\" says Sunderland-born Ryder, \"I couldn't speak a word of Welsh. But I made it my business to learn - to be part of the community. Me and my husband put our children in the Welsh-medium school that was bolted on to the English school in our village. It was a great decision.\" </p> <p>What is the point in learning Welsh? \"There are so many,\" says Huw Hughes. \"You just have the literary tradition of Shakespeare. I also have a great literary tradition you can't really grasp, as well as Shakespeare. It gives me an access to the tradition of my own ancestors, too.\" </p> <p>But the Welsh language is a tender flower. Large numbers of non-Welsh speakers have been moving to traditional centres of the language, causing resentment as they inflate property prices and, unlike Ryder, do not become involved in local traditions. At the same time, the main Welsh towns and cities are near England, that great sucking vortex of Anglo-American globalised values and so they are often ill-inclined to learn the language of their ancestors. </p> <p>The Welsh-language pressure group Cymuned announced earlier this week that it is preparing a campaign of civil disobedience to defend Welsh-speaking communities. Last weekend, its members blocked the A44 into Aberystwyth to highlight the issue of students who stay in town after graduation but do not try to learn Welsh. Not exactly the same as the Sons of Glendower burning holiday homes, but there is clearly still much resentment of English interlopers. </p> <p>The threat to Welsh isn't quite so brutal as it was in the 19th century, when speaking Welsh was regarded as offensive by Anglocentric educators. \"In the days of the \"Welsh Not\" in the 19th century,\" says Huw's friend Elaine, \"if I said something in Welsh at school, the teacher would put a piece of string with a board around my neck with the legend \"Welsh Not\". If Eifion then said something to me in Welsh, the board would be hung around his neck. Then if Elaine said something in Welsh to me at playtime, it would be hung around her neck. At the end of the day, the one with the Welsh Not would have their hand spanked.\" </p> <p>I did not know that. Clearly it was time to take an Englishman's remedial tour of Wales. I decided on a coast-to-coast journey from Cardiff Bay in the south to Llandudno in the north. Some hope. Thanks to Dr Beeching, 1960s scourge of the railways, there are no train services from the Welsh capital to North Wales that do not involve crossing back in to England. There used to be a railway from Carmarthen to Aberystwyth that continued north, but no longer. And there are no internal flights. So I decided to drive, and in doing so found a country that is geographically divided and thus culturally very diverse. </p> <p>When the drinkers at Y Mochyn Du learned what I was planning, they suggested a consciousness-raising itinerary. I followed it as closely as possible, though I did get hopelessly lost between Builth Wells and Tregaron and found myself rising and falling along single-tracked roads fringed by gloriously dying golden bracken and confronted by unexpectedly grand, sunny mountain vistas that opened up between October showers. I think here I found what the Welsh writer Jan Morris this week called \"a love land, impervious to the vulgarities of map-makers and politicians\". I was for a while delightfully lost. </p> <p>But I did find Cilmeri, a suggested stop on the itinerary, where there is a monument to Llewellyn ap Gruffydd, killed by an English soldier in 1282. Huw describes this Welsh hero as \"the last true Prince of Wales\". Unlike, presumably, our own proper Charlie. And I did visit Trawsfynydd, the home town of the 20th-century Welsh poet Hedd Wynn, another national hero. \"He believed in the Welsh place in the UK,\" Huw had told me. \"He went off to fight in world war one and he died in battle.\" He died before he was able to collect the Welsh poetry prize at the Eisteddfod that he had so coveted. </p> <p>Most piquantly, I visited Llyn Celyn dam near Bala. It was here that, in 1965, the village of Capel Celyn was deemed expendable in order to meet England's purportedly greater needs. It was drowned by waters rising behind the dam on the river Tryweryn to secure water supplies to Liverpool. I sat in the small chapel of remembrance and thought about my Welsh ancestors, who may well feel betrayed that their descendants left Wales for the richer pickings of the West Midlands, flooding other Welsh valleys to create reservoirs to provide the English with water. If I was Welsh, I'd be resentful. </p> <p>\"It was the Westminster decision to allow this dam to happen, against the vote of all the Welsh MPs including the Tories, that really provided momentum for the devolution movement,\" says Eifion Williams. \"It was really a crime against humanity.\" </p> <p>I went on to Llandudno, which Huw had said was \"the shame of Wales\". Why? \"Because when you go into Marks &amp; Spencer there and speak Welsh they give you a filthy look and say, \"What?\" And yet Llandudno is the main town in the middle of a large Welsh-speaking area. It is a betrayal of Welshness.\" </p> <p>I am a poor judge of that matter, chiefly because I cannot as yet ask for Chicken Tikka Masala with a Peshwari nan in Welsh. But, like Ryder, I could always learn. \"Now I'm so Welsh that I'm going to be rooting for Wales on Saturday,\" says the English-born Welsh nationalist. \"I've opted for a nation with a real future.\" And maybe she has.</p>",
  "<p>Major record labels have vowed to take on computer giants such as Microsoft and Apple in an effort to establish a common standard for digital music and avoid a repeat of the damaging video format wars between VHS and Betamax in the 1980s.</p> <p>They are determined to ensure that music fans with portable digital music players such as Apple's popular iPod can download and play tracks from online shops running rival Microsoft copyright software.</p> <p>Jay Berman, the chairman of global trade body the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, said the labels would work together to put pressure on technology companies to establish a common standard for downloads. </p> <p>Apple, which makes the popular iPod portable music player, has insisted on using its own propriety format for songs downloaded from iTunes music store, while rival sites use alternative technology developed by Microsoft. </p> <p>However, the decisions have caused havoc for consumers - tracks downloaded from iTunes will only play on an iPod while tracks downloaded from rival services such as Napster, My Coke Music and MSN will not. </p> <p>And other portable music devices, such as those made by Creative, Rio and Sony, are not compatible with iTunes but do play tracks downloaded from the dozens of rival services. </p> <p>Apple has borne the brunt of the criticism for refusing to open up its technology to other online music retailers. Some record executives have likened the situation to forcing owners of a certain brand of CD player to buy their music from a single high street record store. </p> <p>Earlier this year Apple threatened to sue rival download store RealNetworks for making its tracks available to iPod owners. </p> <p>Because the iPod is by far the most popular portable player and iTunes is the most popular online download retailer, selling more than 100 million tracks in the year since it launched in the US, it is in Apple's interests to maintain the status quo for as long as possible. </p> <p>But Mr Berman said it was vital for the industry to establish a single digital rights management technology as part of a strategy to popularise legal downloads among consumers. </p> <p>\"We are trying to decide how to make a digital rights management platform that would be compatible across all the various services. We think it should be based on interoperability,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We've just started the discussions in the last couple of weeks, involving the IFPI and the Recording Industry Association of America. I'm very optimistic.\"</p> <p>The move is part of the record industry's attempt to fight back against falling global sales. It is simultaneously attempting to popularise legal download sites while taking legal action against those who illegally swap pirated tracks over file-sharing networks. </p> <p>While Apple has been widely praised for bringing online music into the mainstream market, some labels have complained it has priced tracks too low, making it difficult for them to make a profit from them. </p> <p>And independent labels in Europe such as Domino, home to Franz Ferdinand, and Ministry of Sound have also clashed with the California-based company. Despite agreeing a deal to distribute their music through iTunes weeks ago, their bands have still not been added to the service. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Once the universe seemed small. Stargazers believed that climbing a tower brought them closer to the heavens. Now one could take a rocket ship to the edges of the solar system and still hardly have inched into the cosmos. The universe has expanded, not only in a physical sense, but in our conception of its dimensions. From a space smaller than the solar system, as the universe was visualised in the 16th century, it it now known to stretch for billions of light years with billions of galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars. </p> <p>The communication of scientific ideas to the public has become ever more sophisticated too. Literary forms and documentaries employing state-of-the-art simulations capitalise on the interest stimulated by iconic images from space, and by the spectacular weirdness of developments in cosmology and theoretical physics. </p> <p>Since the early 20th century, scientific theories of the nature of reality have begun to diverge drastically from human experience. The theories of relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that time is not absolute, space stretches and warps and, at the sub-atomic level, not only can there be no certainty as to a particle's position and velocity, but a particle can be in more than one place at the same time. These properties are hard to comprehend. </p> <p>Perhaps this explains the upsurge of collaborations between scientists and artists. I've worked in this \"sciart\" context for the past decade. Composing a 1,000-year-long piece of music or working in zero gravity, the question \"Where does the science end and the art start?\" has never arisen, the two always appear entwined. Yet, while the term \"sciart\" aspires to encapsulate its cross-disciplinary practice, it is misleading, implying that science and art are opposites. It is adspeak used to repackage what is an old alliance. </p> <p>What is considered \"art\" on the one hand and \"science\" on the other enjoy a symbiosis at a more fundamental level than suggested by \"sciart\". A cubist work could be termed sciart for its exploration of spatial and temporal dimensions as much as a collaboration between a theoretical physicist and a composer to create a sonification of colliding particles. </p> <p>While their ultimate aims may differ - science seeking a clear answer, reproducible and verifiable under experimental conditions, art working toward the unexpected - their starting points and working methods have much in common. Both science and art observe, ask questions, form hypotheses, conduct experiments. Serendipity is not the preserve of art. Observational cosmologists build progressively more powerful telescopes, not to look for something that they theorise exists, but to see what lies out there, on the edges of space and time, unknown and unexpected. Curiosity on a cosmic scale. </p> <p> A glance at the shelves of new popular science books will reveal Mauve, the story of a chemist, William Perkins, who, while attempting the synthesis of quinine from coal tar in the mid-19th century, derived aniline purple, the first synthetic organic dye. The colour mauve became fashionable, made Perkins a fortune, spawned the synthetic chemical industry and started a chain of events that led to rocket science. In the fiction section, this serendipitous discovery and its progeny appear woven into Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, a meeting of art, philosophy, myth and science manifesting as literature. </p> <p>For the past year I've been artist in residence in an astrophysics department. What am I? I have a degree in computer science, I'm a musician and I work as an artist, in the expanded post- 60s sense of the word. Were it necessary to appear with palette and canvas in the life room I wouldn't get a look-in. </p> <p>I'm interested in the questions cosmologists ask, I'm curious to discover how things work. I'm not trying to formulate deep physical laws; I'm taking this comprehension - or lack of it - as a starting point to discover connections, to make tangible ideas contrary to my experience, to experiment and, finally, to make something (a film, an installation, music) that communicates the results of this process. </p> <p>It's easy to see what an artist can gain from working in such an environment, but what can the scientists get from art? My astrophysics colleagues say that art assumes an importance through enabling scientists to think about what they do in a wider context. Creative thought, an unquan tifiable process if there ever was one, is as necessary for a scientist as for an artist. </p> <p>Physics seeks to understand the laws of nature, not human experience. In the gap between the two exists a vacuum where strange alliances form to communicate from the interface between our experience as sentient beings and theories of reality beyond our conception. </p> <p>As Albert Einstein said: \"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.\" </p> <p>Jem Finer, once of the Pogues, is artist in residence in Oxford University's astrophysics department </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:info@cosmolog.org.uk\">info@cosmolog.org.uk</a></p>",
  "Taiwan's independence-minded president, Chen Shui-bian, is promising that his National Day address on Sunday will soothe tensions with China that have ratcheted up dangerously in recent months. <p>But conciliatory words from President Chen, or even an attempt to revive a bilateral dialogue frozen since 1999, cannot shield Taiwan from accelerating, adverse geopolitical and economic shifts involving the Asian region, the US and the EU. </p> <p>Rarely since the 1949 break with the mainland, which Beijing never accepted, has Taiwan's attempt to coexist peacefully but separately looked so problematic. </p> <p>\"There is a possibility that China and Taiwan are now approaching the moment of truth,\" said the Japanese commentator Masahiro Wakabayashi. </p> <p>Developments inside China, in particular last month's consolidation of Hu Jintao's leadership, are key to the shifting strategic balance. President Hu's \"peaceful rise\" approach to China's advancement may in time herald a more enlightened policy. But for now he is maintaining a tough stance on Taiwan. </p> <p>\"You must seize the moment and do a good job preparing for a military struggle,\" Mr Hu told the People's Liberation Army recently. This \"struggle\" currently includes the deployment of hundreds of missiles across the Taiwan Strait. </p> <p>Speaking at the UN last month, China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, bluntly warned Taiwan's regional neighbours to keep their noses out of China's business. \"The separatist activities of the Taiwanese authorities pose a serious threat ... to the peace of the Asia-Pacific region,\" Mr Li said. In other words: mess with us on Taiwan and you will all be in big trouble. </p> <p>Australia and Singapore have certainly got the message. Both countries recently told Taiwan not to expect help if it got into a shooting war with China. </p> <p>Singapore's leader, Lee Hsien Loong, warned in August of \"a real risk of miscalculation and mishap\". If it came to a fight, no Asian country would support Taiwan. \"Unfortunately, very few Taiwanese leaders understand this,\" he said. </p> <p>Taiwan's foreign minister, Chen Tan-sun, subsequently accused Singapore of \"hugging China's balls\". </p> <p>All this might not matter so much if Taiwan could count on unambiguous US backing. But Washington is preoccupied with Iraq and the \"war on terror\" and already has one Asian \"crisis\" on its hands, with North Korea. </p> <p>The US is urging Taiwan to take more responsibility for its own defence, in part by agreeing to buy a $18bn US arms package (about \u00a310bn), or risk becoming \"a liability rather than a partner\", in the words of a senior official. </p> <p>Ironically, Taiwan's recently disclosed development of offensive missile capabilities and its talk of creating a \"balance of terror\" is partly responsible for Beijing's renewed antagonism. But it is China's growing economic clout that may ultimately prove decisive in influencing US policy as well as that of Taiwan's neighbours. </p> <p>China has been dubbed the new workshop of the world. Its rapid economic expansion is driving Asian and global growth; it is set to become the world's biggest importer and exporter. Its GDP is projected to surpass that of the US and all others by 2050. </p> <p>Whatever it thinks about China's policies on Taiwan, Tibet and human rights, the US increasingly cannot afford to ignore Beijing's aspirations. Much the same goes for the EU which this year will become China's biggest trading partner. This provides the context for Jacques Chirac's state visit, beginning today. </p> <p>The French president is touting for business. But, by going to China, President Chirac, an arch opponent of what he sees as American global hegemony, is also demonstrating to the US that France, and the rest of Europe, have alternative strategic options. </p> <p>This is a new version of the old superpower game of \"playing the China card\". That point will also be underscored by today's Asia-Europe meeting in Hanoi. </p> <p>Mr Chirac says talk of independence in Taiwan is \"irresponsible\". And he is pushing for the EU's post-Tiananmen embargo on arms sales to be lifted. That raises the extraordinary prospect of the US arming Taiwan while the EU arms China. </p> <p>It is against this hazardous backdrop that Mr Chen will speak on Sunday. Taiwan and China have their own substantial economic ties. Both sides say they want a peaceful solution. But no one knows how to achieve it. Approaching Taiwanese legislative elections may inflame the situation. And whether Mr Chen realises it or not, Taiwan's freedom of manoeuvre is rapidly diminishing.</p>",
  "My fellow Americans <p>On one thing - and one thing only - President Bush and I agree: these are perilous times and this is an election, first and foremost, about the security of the country we both love. But we disagree, at the profoundest level, on what exactly is the nature of the threats facing us; where our security properly lies, and on whom we may safely depend to make America safe, prosperous and strong, an America we can feel proud about passing on to our children. </p> <p>President Bush asks you to re-elect him because he claims that only under his administration can the prosperity and security of the republic be guaranteed. In response, let me ask you the simplest and most serious question. Do you feel truly safer, do you feel better, or worse, about our future four years after Mr Bush came to the White House? With more than a thousand of our courageous, selfless young men and women sacrificed in Iraq to the misguided obsessions of a few civilian know-it-alls; with thousands more seriously wounded, casualties not just of the battle but the ideologues who told the country over and again that the people who attacked us on 9/11 were to be found in Iraq; with a government that sent hundreds of thousands of Americans into an inferno with no clue about how to get them out again, do you really feel safe putting our future in their hands? Why should we trust our fate to a president who in the State of the Union address conjured up a frightener - African uranium supposedly supplied for Saddam Hussein's nuclear arms programme that was already known not to exist? Why should we trust an administration whose own appointees - from General Shinseki to Paul Bremer - have called it to task for irresponsible and inadequate planning? Why should we have the slightest confidence in its ability to deal with the threat of terror, when, at the moment we were poised to take out our true enemy - Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida - the enemy who was a real and imminent threat, they turned us in the opposite direction and sent our troops headlong against a tyrant who posed no immediate threat at all? </p> <p>I have said it before, and I will say it again even though my opponents try to smear me as un-American when I do: they have led us into the wrong war against the wrong enemy. When President Bush stood on an aircraft carrier in front of that \"Mission Accomplished\" banner, he was confusing the battle with the war. They always thought the war could be fought with tanks and aerial bombs. But this is a war of suitcase detonators and car bombs. It is a war we have to fight at home as well as abroad. So I ask you again, do you feel safer with a government that has created a debt so ruinous that it has necessitated cuts in funding for first responders - for our firemen and police; that it has left container ships all but uninspected; our nuclear power stations pitifully vulnerable? My opponents attack me for voting against big-spender weapons programmes, but let me ask you which you would rather have: a properly funded counterterrorist inspection programme operating in our container ports, or billions spent on Star Wars missile defences that have never passed the first tests of reliability and are targeted at enemies that no longer pose a threat? And when, with our National Guards and Reserves stretched to the limit, and their long-suffering families' selflessness exploited through \"Stop Loss\" extensions of service, the president tells us that we need no more boots on the ground, can we ever believe him? </p> <p>But, my fellow Americans, when I speak of our national security, I mean much more than raw military muscle, vital though that is. For true safety does begin at home. And when we look at what the Bush administration has done - or proposes to do - to our social security; to our fiscal and our physical health; to the fragile integrity of our environment; to the battles that science must fight against disease - to the entire fabric of American life from cradle to grave; we can only gape in horrified disbelief. More than any administration since that of Herbert Hoover, the government of George W Bush is playing fast and loose with the American future; your children's American future. The president's promise four years ago was to \"leave no child behind\" - but he has betrayed that promise, draining funds from the programme, leaving countless children behind in the dust of his fiscal recklessness. </p> <p>Let's just look at what President Deficit has done to our country: turned a record multi-trillion dollar surplus into a multi-trillion dollar ocean of red ink. Unless we do something now, and urgently, our children will be paying the bill for this profligacy for generations to come. And don't let President Deficit tell you it had to be done to fight a war! When we had to fight the war against Japan and Germany, President Roosevelt asked the American people to make sacrifices and we did, with a great outpouring of patriotic dollars and hard work. But President Deficit's idea of wartime sacrifice is giving tax freebies to the rich while stiffing the middle class and working people of this country. They get the peanuts from his tax breaks; the multi-millionaires, the Dick Cheneys of this world, get the caviar. </p> <p>What's the president's proposal to try to contain the damage from his financial train wreck? Make his tax cuts for the rich permanent, thus ensuring that the damage he is doing to the integrity of our national finances is all but irreversible! When a deficit that seems derisory compared to the one America is now facing, threatened, his father faced the facts and did the right thing, whatever the political cost. But his son, as ever, does the bidding of the radical right, not the right thing. </p> <p>You see, my fellow Americans, when it comes to true security, George W Bush and his administration have a simple message for all of us and that message is \"Good luck, pals, you're on your own.\" Short of body armour? Write home. Job security outsourced? Hey, don't come whining to us. Plenty of reconstruction opportunities in downtown Baghdad! Worried about social security entitlements once that big national debt hits the fan? Well, that's why we want to privatise a chunk of social security, linking it to the fortunes of the stock market! Excuse me, what's that you say about \"boom and bust\"? Don't be nervous nellies! It's only your lifetime's payments we're talking about. </p> <p>Where do these people live? Well, not in the world of middle-class America, that's for sure. Or how could they ask seniors worried about the rising costs of healthcare to face deductibles of one or two thousand dollars before Medicare or Medicaid pays the bills for the high-tech diagnostics that can save untold numbers of lives? Their attitude is: it's your money, my sick friends, you'd better look around for value. But you don't shop for life at Walmart. And this must be the only administration in modern American history which, through inflicting crippling restrictions on embryonic stem cell research, has handcuffed scientists working to advance our treatments for debilitating and fatal diseases, while it puts the price of treatment for those diseases out of reach for millions of the uninsured. </p> <p>Welcome to the America George Bush and Dick Cheney want you and your children to live in: the America of I'm doing fine and to hell with the rest of you, the America of colour-coded fear and high-roller special favours; the America where security is for the few and anxiety for the rest of us. </p> <p>But I want your vote so that a different America can at last hold up its head, and shout out loud. It's an America where true security is not go-it-alone, either at home or in the world, an America that believes, in our heart of hearts, that we are all in it together; an America that is not ashamed of public service whether in uniform or in the classroom; which does not believe that reaching out to those making do on less and less is somehow weak or unpatriotic. I have seen that other America, waiting to be heard from. I have met it every day on this campaign and through all of my adult life: the volunteer spirit that made the Peace Corps; the sense of community you can find everywhere across this country in churches and charities; in bake sales and rock-for-change concerts; in small-town America and big-city America. It's the same spirit Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy called on when they summoned America to moments of renewal. It's the spirit of connection - that golden ribbon that winds around us, and which makes citizens out of mere individuals. It's the spirit of the Democratic party and of our American democracy: generous and tolerant, but strong and vigilant in the defence of our liberty. </p> <p>Give me the opportunity to serve you as the 44th president of this beloved republic of ours, and I solemnly promise that spirit will be rekindled, and an America that we can be proud of will once again flame into life. </p> <p> \u00a9 Simon Schama 2004</p>",

  "<p>The Mipcom trade fair sits at the business end of the television industry - buying, selling and making programmes. None of the earnest debate over the BBC charter renewal or the future of Channel 4 that grace the Edinburgh or Cambridge festivals featured in Cannes this week. </p> <p>Descending into the sales bearpit in the cavernous Palais des Festivals on the waterfront, the global TV market seems in rude health. The complex is jammed with more than 1,300 exhibitors from 57 countries, selling everything from reality formats to animation, comedies and TV films. </p> <p>Seasoned observers say the event has regained some of the energy it had before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which cut off the advertising revenues that fuel Mipcom and led to American media groups keeping lower profiles. It's no Cannes Film Festival, but there were game attempts to add glamour to that newfound confidence. Miss World paid a beachside visit on Wednesday, Bjorn Again played at the relaunch of ITV's programme sales arm and this year has seen the most parties since 2000. </p> <p>But this vibrant bazaar, staged in April and October, is not pitched on a level playing field. The biggest yachts around the Palais - boat owners make a mint from the stream of festivals that Cannes hosts - are rented by the big US studios, who also set up bunkers in the Palais that dwarf the rest. While the more colourful programming can be found among the smaller producers - Doctor Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation is coming to Channel 4 soon - it is the US majors who dominate. </p> <p>After years of global advertising drought and faltering recovery, all the TV markets are back, says David Hulbert, the president of Walt Disney Television International. Its biggest programme, \"dark fun\" soap opera Desperate Housewives, has been sold to most major territories already. \"It is quite buzzy this year. The trouble is that you always look at a trade fair through your own eyes and this year we have a really good line-up, so you tend to feel that everyone is smiling at you,\" he says. </p> <p>In recent years, Mipcom has seen a tendency for broadcasters and buyers to tread carefully, delay signing off deals and not spend to the limit of their budgets. But it is three years since TV advertising hit its post-9/11 low and some big players, such as ProSiebenSat.1 in Germany and Sky Italia, have emerged from financial troubles or restructured their businesses: \"All the markets are back, mostly above the 2000 peak. A lot of the platforms have gone through their restructuring and are back in the market. And people are beginning to talk again about channel launches,\" adds Hulbert. </p> <p><strong> Post-9/11</strong><br> </p> <p>Outside the bulge-bracket players such as Disney, the British contingent is also more confident about this year. Channel 4 International has reported good business for the 9/11 drama the Hamburg Cell, a programme that might have been a tougher sale last year. </p> <p>Christina Willoughby, the head of international sales at Channel 4 International, says buyers are moving quicker than ever before as the advertising upturn and proliferation of digital channels ratchets up the competition: \"I don't think the environment has ever been quite this competitive among the different countries represented here. </p> <p>\"I do feel that decisions are being made faster, and that's down to increased competition in the buyers' own marketplaces. It does not matter whether it's Fox or ABC in America fighting it out over a different format. They are all very competitive because they are all chasing their target audiences and want to get the best programmes possible.\" </p> <p>The British independent production community is also upbeat this year, but not for the same reasons as Walt Disney and Channel 4. The new terms of trade between independent producers and British broadcasters allow, at least in theory, the smaller production outfits to broker deals without recourse to the BBC, ITV or Channel 4. Co-production deals are easier to strike this year, says Andrew Zein, the managing director of Tiger Aspect, producer of Teachers and Mr Bean. </p> <p>\"In the past you would come and have a conversation with someone about getting involved in a programme in the UK and you were not necessarily master of your own destiny. You would have to go back and try to persuade a British broadcaster to bring another party to the table, which was tough because the broadcaster owned all the rights.\" </p> <p>With the end of that broadcaster rights exclusivity in January this year, they can now sign distribution deals to help finance a production without having to get the broadcaster along: \"You can have those conversations with people here knowing that you can put the deal together yourself. You cannot underestimate how significant that is.\" </p> <p>Matthew Frank, the head of distribution at RDF Media, the maker of Wife Swap, adds that a flood of independent producers are now dealing through RDF after broadcasters were forced to relinquish their grip on distribution rights. </p> <p>Some independent producers are more cautious. Charles Thompson, the managing director of Mentorn, which makes Question Time, warns that inexperienced independents could over-extend themselves: \"Getting the rights is one thing, knowing how to exploit them is another.\" </p> <p>In the far-flung corners of the Palais, there are glimpses of the future as the majority of delegates thrash out deals to fill next year's schedules. High definition TV is expected to become a mass-market technology by the end of the decade but delegates did not flock to screenings of sports events and rock concerts shot in a format that produces clearer, sharper images. The popularity of HDTV at Mipcom next year is up to the global consumer. If high definition sets and plasma screen sales grow over the next six months, broadcasters will follow. </p> <p>One of the most radical contributions came from Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis, owner of the Leo Burnett advertising agency and media buying group Zenith-Optimedia. He warned that advertising and programming will have to change as personal video recorders and broadband make the old 30-second ad break increasingly redundant. Advertiser-funded shows and product placement are tightly regulated in Britain, and there is some pressure to lift restrictions. It is not a new debate but the call from advertisers to have a closer involvement in programming as ad slots lose their impact is becoming louder. In the future, advertising executives could be roaming with the sales teams, buyers and producers on the dealing floor. </p> <p>\"[Broadcasters and advertising groups] have worked very closely but with a certain distance until now. The media, most of the time, has kept advertising agencies at a certain distance because of the influence the advertising money can have on the content. We have to work more closely together while at the same time being respectful to the viewers and the content.\"</p>",
  "There is Heinz Field, home of the Steelers football team, the Heinz chapel, with its 23 stained glass windows, the Heinz hall for music lovers, the Heinz Gallery for visual art, and coming soon, in a converted red-brick factory, the Heinz riverside luxury flats. <p>In the birthplace of an empire built on ketchup and baby food, the Heinz family brand is inescapable, and so it seems natural that the wife of the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, should continue to be known here simply as Teresa Heinz. </p> <p>Thirteen years after his death her first husband, Senator John Heinz, remains a beloved figure in Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican who carried every ward of the then solidly Democratic blue-collar town. </p> <p>The verdict on his widow is mixed. Mrs Heinz Kerry's cosmopolitanism (she was raised in colonial Africa and speaks five languages), fiery temperament and wealth (estimated at \u00a3420m) make her an oddity in American political life. </p> <p>Although she has inherited some of her late husband's popularity, and is appreciated for her management of the charitable trusts that have poured large sums into education and the environment, Mrs Heinz Kerry has also created a sizeable body of enemies. </p> <p>\"Witch\", said the signs hoisted outside when she appeared this week at a Democratic meeting in rural Pennsylvania. \"Stay out of Greensburg, Witch.\" </p> <p>Here fans say the extreme reaction of some Pennsylvanians is evidence of the state's conservative streak. In this part of the state, party workers seeking the women's vote dare not mention abortion rights. Her defenders say the anger she generates is evidence of Pennsylvania's discomfort with assertive women. </p> <p>\"Here we are in 2004 and women can do anything they like in the world, and we still have these ridiculous expectations about political wives that they should be like Stepford wives,\" says Meghan Kelly, an English student and bartender. \"Teresa is the anti-Stepford wife.\" </p> <p>Other women supporters are transfixed by her undeniable glamour. Now 66, Mrs Heinz Kerry is five years older than her husband - a fact she flaunts - and she has a way of flipping back her long dark hair that is age defying. </p> <p>\"The fact that she is in her 60s and thinks she is sexy I think is wonderful for women,\" says Ronda Springer, a manicurist in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. </p> <p><b>Outburst</b><br> </p> <p>But Democratic operatives remain unconvinced that she is ready for general release. After an outburst on the eve of the Democratic convention last July when she told a columnist from a rightwing Pittsburgh newspaper to \"shove it\", the prospective first lady began limiting her appearances to smaller and generally friendly audiences. </p> <p>Most have been in Pennsylvania, her adopted home state, where the presidential race is a dead heat and she can draw on the residue of goodwill for her late husband. </p> <p>It is here that refusal to be moulded into a presidential appendage has set her apart on the campaign trail. While she has loyally campaigned at Mr Kerry's side since the political season began in January, she is no conventional consort. She refuses to act the role of the perfect placid wife, like Laura Bush, but nor does she radiate the suppressed political ambitions of Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>She had her shot at politics - she was offered and turned down a Senate seat after her first husband was killed in a plane crash - and says she wants to concentrate on policy, specifically healthcare. </p> <p>\"I would just like to have a little conversation about what it is we are all facing,\" she began her address one night early this week in Greensburg. </p> <p>In a throaty voice, and apparently without notes, she launched into a 40-minute treatise on job security, terrorism, the Kyoto treaties on global warming, her childhood in Africa, the meaning of America, education, healthcare and the cost of prescription drugs. </p> <p>She refers to her first husband after about 90 seconds. Mr Kerry, whom she married in 1995, gets a mention after 12 minutes. From then on she makes occasional references to both Johns, using only their first names, which is confusing at times. </p> <p>But she has an impressive memory for statistics, and when she begins elucidating the Democratic plans for guaranteed child healthcare it is clear she knows her subject matter and cares deeply. \"People who lose jobs and healthcare are hit by a double whammy no human being deserves,\" she told a gathering at a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh this week. </p> <p>She can be disarming. Leaning forward in her chair with elbows on knees, she looks down on the floor as she tells the story of how as a university student in South Africa she gathered her first impressions of the US from the movies - especially Marilyn Monroe in Some Like it Hot. </p> <p>A moment later, however, she displays an almost breathtaking insensitivity. Sitting beside a man describing with difficulty his battle against Parkinson's for the past 17 years, she goes off into a riff about bone marrow cancer, birth defects and a woman she met in Florida who suffered a devastating stroke when she was barely 30. Thanks to experimental treatment in the Dominican Republic, the woman made a full recovery, Mrs Heinz Kerry says. </p> <p>\"She still has a speech with a slight slur, a little bit,\" she says, lisping a bit in illustration. \"But she is perfectly fine.\" </p> <p>Because she generally appears only before committed Democrats - and at predominantly female gatherings - such gaffes are generally forgiven. </p> <p>And for all her much publicised resistance to being \"packaged\" by Democratic handlers she is morphing into a political spouse. She moves easily from healthcare to her husband's record and vision for the US. \"When it is his turn, he will present a face of America to the world as a face of America that is proud but is not arrogant, that is strong but not threatening, and that is the kind of America that wants to lead,\" she says. </p> <p>It sounds almost exactly like something John Kerry would have said.</p>",
  "<p>Government figures have revealed the true extent of the dumping of raw sewage into the river Thames and will increase pressure on ministers to build a \u00a31.5bn interceptor tunnel. </p> <p>Statistics compiled by the Environment Agency show that more than 12 million cubic metres of raw sewage were discharged into the river from five overloaded pumping stations between April and August. </p> <p>The most notable occasion was on August 3, when freak storms led to the discharge of 886,000 cubic metres, killing thousands of fish. </p> <p>But the figures, obtained by Liberal Democrats on the London assembly, show that the August 3 discharges were moderate compared with those before and since. The official statistics show that on May 4, during and after rainfall of 16.4 millimetres, 2.8m cubic metres of raw sewage was released into the Thames. </p> <p>There were four occasions in which more than 1m cubic metres of sewage was pumped into the river. It is understood that there are up to 60 discharges each year. </p> <p>Last week the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said ministers were not ready to proceed with the interceptor tunnel, despite the fact that it was the preferred solution of experts who sat on a steering group to investigate the problem. </p> <p>The panel included officials from Defra. Thames Water spent \u00a34m on a study, which revealed that the interceptor tunnel would take about 10 years to build and cost \u00a31.5bn. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat spokesman for the environment, Dee Doocey, said: \"These figures are an absolute disgrace. So much sewage being pumped into the Thames is bad for the environment, bad for human health and bad for the image of the Thames. </p> <p>\"The dumping of raw sewage into the Thames is something that happened in the Victorian era. It certainly should not be happening in the 21st century in one of the most developed capital cities in the world. </p> <p>\"It is incredible that despite all the predictions that global warming would cause more violent storms and heavier downpours London's sewer system is totally unprepared and unable to cope and pumping millions of cubic metres of raw sewage into the Thames.\" </p> <p>Jon Goddard, the Environment Agency's technical director, said he welcomed interim measures suggested by the government to address the problem, but still believed a tunnel would be necessary. </p> <p>\"These figures tell us that the August 4 discharge was by no means the biggest. We are convinced that the tunnel is the only way forward, but we still have to convince Defra. People suspect there are soft options, but there are no soft options,\" he said. </p> <p>Tests commissioned by the Guardian two weeks ago showed that the river is being polluted to a worrying degree even by moderate discharges. </p> <p>Laboratory analysis showed that traces of E-coli and other harmful bacteria in water taken at Putney and Hammersmith greatly exceeded EU bathing water limits and guidelines. </p> <p>The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, has been among those calling for the government to build the tunnel.</p>",
  "<p>With the death of Michel Batisse, at the age of 81, the international community has lost a pioneer in the promotion of scientific cooperation and understanding for the study, management and protection of the environment. A leading figure at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) for more than half a century, he contributed uniquely to the architecture and development of its programmes on environment and natural resource issues. </p> <p>Batisse was born in Chateauroux, in the Indredepartment of France. After studies in Paris as an engineer and physicist, he was appointed, in 1951, as Unesco's science liaison officer for the Middle East, based in Egypt. Six years later, he returned to Unesco headquarters in Paris, where he took responsibility for the major project on arid lands. </p> <p>From 1961 to 1972, Batisse was charged with Unesco's activities in ecology, conservation, hydrology and geology. A lifelong interest in water resources led him to take a key role in shaping a worldwide study of the Earth's water cycle. The result was the international hydrological decade (1965-74), which gave rise to the international hydrological programme, still the linchpin of Unesco's work on fresh-water resources. He was also instrumental in Unesco's support for the international bio logical programme, under the International Council for Science (ICSU). </p> <p>In 1968, he was secretary general of the pioneering inter-governmental conference of experts on the \"scientific basis for the rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere\" - the Biosphere Conference - which resulted in the programme on man and the biosphere (MAB), and helped pave the way for the UN Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972. </p> <p>Within the framework of the MAB programme, Batisse saw the need for setting up specific areas where the conservation of biological diversity could meet the basic needs of local people. There are now 440 of these biosphere reserves in 97 countries. </p> <p>Batisse combined global vision with an acute sense of what was politically possible and practically achievable. During the 1970s, he looked after the promotion and coordination of Unesco's environmental sciences and natural resources programmes, where the geographic anchoring of the subject called for cooperation between governments. </p> <p>He played a crucial role in the preparation of the Convention for the Protection of the World's Natural and Cultural Heritage, in which he made sure that the natural heritage would be given its proper place. </p> <p>After his retirement as Unesco's assistant director general (science) in 1984, Batisse remained an honorary scientific adviser to the organisation. He also became a senior scientific adviser to the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and to the World Bank. At the same time, Unep and the French government asked him to take responsibility for the Mediterranean Blue Plan, an innovative project aimed at promoting cooperation towards sustainable development among countries bordering the Mediterranean. </p> <p>Batisse was on the board of directors of Conservation International. He served as special adviser on biodiversity for the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development, and participated incisively in many other conservation initiatives, such as the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and its World Commission on Protected Areas, Unesco's advisory committee on biosphere reserves and the French WWF scientific committee. </p> <p>During his long career, he wrote more than 100 scientific papers devoted to the environment and natural resources. A gifted and skilled communicator in both French and English, he set himself the highest standards, and expected others to do likewise. He was a man of vision who also understood the practicalities of making things work. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Claude, and daughters Laurence and St\u00e9phane-Isabelle. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michel Batisse, environmentalist, born April 3 1923; died September 27 2004</p>",
  "<p>Its star was a sarcastic dog called Dougal who looked as if he had been prepared earlier from the inside of a toilet roll, a ping-pong ball and several skeins of mustard-coloured wool. His best pals were Florence, a papier-mch\u00e9 girl with pigtails and oversized boots, a dopey rabbit called Dylan, the frenetic snail Brian and a very weird, mustachioed chap on a spring. Together, they got up to improbable antics in a brightly coloured magic garden with a cardboard cutout merry-go-round. </p> <p>But from such unlikely material, a cult was born. This year, The Magic Roundabout, one of the most successful British children's programmes of all time, celebrates its 40th birthday. Forget Hector's House and Paddington Bear, the Wombles and Postman Pat. At its peak, around eight million viewers - children and adults - were glued to the Magic Roundabout, shown originally in the five-minute slot before the early evening news on BBC1. </p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, more than 25 years after it disappeared from our screens, Dougal and co are now set for a revival. A \u00a312.8m feature film starring the voices of Kylie Minogue, Robbie Williams, Sir Ian McKellen and Joanna Lumley, which is currently being promoted at the Franco-British film festival in Dinard, will bring them back to life early next year. </p> <p>To British audiences Eric Thompson, father of the actor Emma, and narrator of the episodes, was Mr Magic Roundabout. His sophisticated scripts, often way over the heads of younger viewers, seemed the epitome of dry Anglo-Saxon wit. </p> <p>But, of course, The Magic Roundabout was not British but French. It began life in the early 1960s as Le Man\u00e8ge Enchant\u00e9 and was created by Serge Danot, a former decorator whose only previous claim to fame was that he had once helped paint the Eiffel Tower. His pink, red, blue and orange merry-go-round was set in a garden where the colour green, which he hated, was strangely absent. </p> <p>Danot died in 1990, at the age of 59. But in a remote corner of rural France, his magic roundabout continues to turn with its famous strangulated wail. Danot's widow Martine, 52, still has the the original set of the programme, which she lovingly maintains. </p> <p>In the French version of The Magic Roundabout, a strange, springy creature called Zebulon restores the garden's magical properties with a snap of his fingers. This attracts visitors. including a girl called Margotte and her odd friends. </p> <p>Danot, 52, recalls how Dougal - called Pollux in French - was an unexpected star. \"He was originally a minor character in the programme,\" she says. \"At first he didn't say anything, he just made a strange noise. But after the first few programmes viewers began writing asking to see more of the dog, so he became the main character. </p> <p>\"Serge gave him a heavy English accent, which French people found enormously amusing. He went, \"Bow, wow, wow\" (French dogs go, \"Ouah, ouah\"). Dylan, meanwhile, was called Flappy and had a heavy Spanish accent, while Brian the snail was Ambroise and Ermintrude the cow, Azalee. </p> <p>Danot had loved puppets as a child, but left home to work at the age of 16. Forced to give up painting and decorating after smashing his left foot in an accident, he turned his hand to animation. The first episodes of Le Man\u00e8ge Enchant\u00e9 were filmed in a derelict house in Paris, where high-powered lights used to illuminate the set kept blowing the electricity fuses. </p> <p>Danot later moved the roundabout to his family's chamois factory, complete with water mill, set in an enchanting spot on the S\u00e8vre Nantaise river near Nantes. He also teamed up with the British animator Ivor Wood, who went on to create Paddington Bear, the Wombles and Postman Pat. Each five-minute episode took up to two weeks to produce. The characters were photographed 24 times every second to create 7,500 separate images for each programme. </p> <p>France's state broadcaster originally commissioned 13 programmes, the first of which went out in black and white in October 1964. It was an instant hit, and a further 50 episodes were ordered. In the end Danot made around 700 and The Magic Roundabout was translated into 28 languages worldwide, including Iranian and Japanese. </p> <p>After turning down the programme twice for being charming but too \"weird\", the BBC agreed to buy it in 1965. Eric Thompson, at the time presenting BBC2's Play School, was invited to rework the strange French story to render it comprehensible to British viewers. But he reportedly refused to translate the original French tales, branding them simplistic and dull. Instead, he turned down the French sound and made up a witty and sophisticated plot as he went along. </p> <p>Danot was delighted at the programme's success in Britain, though miffed at the choice of Dougal's name, which he suspected was a Thompson dig at the French president, General de Gaulle. </p> <p>In October 1990, having borrowed heavily to invest in new equipment and signed a deal to produce a further 120 episodes, Danot was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He died two months later, leaving Martine, his fourth wife, to bring up their four-year-old son, Max, and pay back the hefty bank loan. </p> <p>\"I really had no choice but to carry on his work,\" she says, \"but at the time I'd never even seen a whole episode of The Magic Roundabout. I sat down and watched the whole lot. Fifteen days later I was at work on the new series and fulfilled the contract.\" </p> <p>Martine believes that her husband would be delighted by the new film, currently being shot in the south of France and due to be released in February next year. Minogue will voice Florence, Williams will voice Dougal, and McKellen will voice Zebedee, as well as his evil alter ego, Zebadie (Ze Baddie). </p> <p>But whether the movie will transcend Danot's simple idea and reach Thompson's level of subtle humour remains to be seen. For, of course, as we young fans grew older and wiser, it became apparent that all was not as it seemed in the Magic Garden. </p> <p>Thompson's family has always denied that there was anything secretly subversive about his plots, or that some of the characters might have been dabbling in mind-altering substances. And Martine looks genuinely horrified by the suggestion. </p> <p>\"On drugs? No, no, absolutely not,\" she says. \"They were all sweet characters created entirely for children. Of course they were products of their age, the 60s, but drugs? No, there's no way they were on drugs. Maybe that's the way you saw it in Britain, but I can assure you that here in France nobody thinks or thought that.\" </p> <p>I'm not convinced. What was in those sugar cubes that sent Dougal spinning in circles? Why did Ermintrude's head turn 360 degrees whenever she chomped on the magic flowers? And are we really expected to believe that dopey Dylan, who would wake up under the tree, strum his guitar, mutter, \"Hey, man,\" and go back to sleep, had not been at some magical plant or other? </p> <p>Martine gives me a withering look that suggests the subject is definitely closed. </p> <p>Boingggg, as Zebedee might have said. Time for bed.</p>",
  "Michael Relph, who has died aged 89, will be most remembered for the films he produced with the director Basil Dearden, at a time when a thriving British film industry was interested in examining - and often criticising - the British way of life. <p>The rich crop included The Blue Lamp (1950), the police drama that launched the later television career of Jack Warner as PC Dixon of Dock Green; Sapphire (1959), one of the first British films to deal with racism; and Victim (1961), the first British film to bring homosexuality out into the open, with Dirk Bogarde as a sympathetic lawyer. </p> <p>The son of the actor George Relph, Michael was born in Broadstone, Dorset. After Bembridge school, on the Isle of Wight, he spent the 1940s as a stage designer, working on such West End productions as Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma and Heartbreak House, Watch On The Rhine, and The Man Who Came To Dinner. </p> <p>A large, emollient man, at ease in all sorts of company, he found a wider horizon in the film industry. He took an apprenticeship at the then Gaumont British Studios at Elstree, becoming assistant art director, before leaving to become art director for Warners, switching back to British filmmaking as art director for Ealing Studios. </p> <p>There, Sir Michael Balcon, the small, unostentatious but tetchy boss, took him under his wing. Relph was art direc tor on The Bells Go Down (1943), a dramatisation of fire-service life that was a pointer to so much of his future work, and Champagne Charley (1944) - both films starred the comedian Tommy Trinder. There was also Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Saraband For Dead Lovers (1948, nominated for an Oscar). He became associate producer to Balcon. </p> <p>It was not, however, until his connection with Dearden that the most creative period of Relph's life began. He and Dearden were two of the six British film men who each put up \u00a35,000 to form Allied Film Makers; Sir John Davis of Rank gave them a \u00a31m revolving production fund in return for distribution rights. Their first production was The League Of Gentlemen (1960), scripted by Bryan Forbes, another investor. </p> <p>The Relph-Forbes connection was to be significant. Forbes had first worked with Relph, as art director, when he was in the cast of the Gertrude Lawrence stage production of September Tide (1948). He always remembered Relph's vast and ingenious wooden set, weighing several tons, and regarded Relph as primarily an inspired designer. </p> <p>When, in 1969, with the British film industry once again facing extinction, Forbes took over Elstree as head of production - with the brief of producing a slate of films just like the major studios of old - Relph and Dearden moved their office into Elstree with him. </p> <p>The layout of their office said something about their partnership. During script conferences, the quiet Relph, dressed in a dark suit, sat on an ordinary black chair behind a black company desk; the snappily-dressed Dearden sat in the body of the office with all and sundry - but seated in a huge chintzy wing chair, akin to a throne. </p> <p>After Dearden died in a car crash in 1971, Relph's professional life faltered. However, his powers of patience, tact and persuasion did not go to waste. They were ideally suited to industry politics. For five years, he was chairman of the Film Production Association of Great Britain, and, at roughly the same time, chairman of the production board of the British Film Institute, of which he was a governor, doling out modest sums of money to young and aspiring British producers. </p> <p>He was, for four years, in charge of production at Boyd's Company, and did some television production work, but was unhappily aware that his best days had stopped when Dearden died. Though he sometimes took a depressed view of the British film industry and his own place in it, Relph was involved in some of the industry's most solid and least showy films. </p> <p>He was married twice: by his first wife, Doris Gosden, he had a son, the producer and former Bafta chairman Simon Relph. His second wife, Maria Barry, died in 2003; they had a daughter, Emma, a former actor. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Michael Leighton George Relph, designer and film producer, born February 16 1915; died September 30 2004</p>",
  "<p>Pawel Pawlikowski exudes the confidence of a man who's conquered the town. And it's hard to say that his attitude isn't justified. His new film, My Summer of Love, has just won the top award at the Edinburgh film festival - and so did his previous one, Last Resort. Its entry into the lucrative North American market is assured after a screening at the Toronto film festival last month where it ended up the subject of a bidding war. Pawlikowski can afford to be satisfied. </p> <p>All this is a long way from the BBC's Community Programme Unit, where he started out in the mid-1980s. Pawlikowski, now 46, scratched his way into film-making by coming up with ideas for Open Space, the CPU's forum for public-issue rants. He came across a priest who was planning to construct a giant crucifix on the top of Pendle Hill in Lancashire. The priest told him he was doing it to counter the influence of local satanists; all he was waiting for was planning consent. Almost 20 years later, Pawlikowski giggles sheepishly at the recollection. His big break didn't work out as planned. For one thing, the priest never got to put his cross up. The local council didn't give him permission. But Pawlikowski made his film anyway; he had been given the money. Lucifer Over Lancashire turned out, he says, \"some scrappy thing\", but something about it stuck in his mind. </p> <p>By the time the draft script of My Summer of Love was finished, an extremely liberal adaptation of a novel by Helen Cross, a large chunk of the plot centred around a born-again Christian who wants to put up a giant cross. Since My Summer of Love isn't a documentary, Pawlikowski could arrange things so that his revivalist character actually gets the job done - even if it all happens over the county border in west Yorkshire. So, for a while in the summer of 2003, a giant cross stood tall over the small town of Bacup. Some things just work out. </p> <p>Since that \"scrappy thing\", Pawlikowski has emerged as one of Britain's most influential and important film-makers. After making a string of prize-winning documentaries in the late 1980s and 1990s, Pawlikowski achieved extraordinary success with Last Resort in a crossover into the land of fiction film-making. It's somehow ironic that one of our leading cinematic lights was actually born and brought up in Poland, only coming to the UK as a 15-year-old with his mother after his parents' marriage broke down. Even so, he used the name \"Paul\" on all his film credits, only reverting to Pawel for Last Resort. It seems an almost redundant observation to say that, via his Polish upbringing, Pawlikowsky has access to a film-making tradition at least as vital, if not more so, than that of his adopted home. </p> <p>Now, he says, he can see a continuity between his fiction and non-fiction films. The documentaries he made, mostly under the aegis of the BBC's Bookmark programme, used literary subjects as a cloak to investigate and satirise burning social and cultural issues - mostly following his interest in eastern Europe and Russia. Probably the best known is Serbian Epics, an account of the revival of Serbian oral poetry that took Pawlikowski and crew to the front lines of the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian civil war in 1994. Another success was Dostoevsky's Travels, a remarkable film about the novelist's grandson, whose primary goal while on a lecture tour of Germany is to get hold of a Mercedes and drive it back east. </p> <p>\"The documentaries I made were never normal documentaries,\" says Pawlikowski now. \"They were about subjects I was obsessed with, and I suppose I thought I could sculpt them. What I think I do with my fiction is the same. You take raw materials, a story that you emotionally connect with. And you put materials together that you like: landscape, character, location. Then you start sculpting with the help of a great director of photography and actors.\" </p> <p>\"I always thought that life is full of stories and characters that feel like literary stories and characters. So when I started making documentaries, they weren't humble empirical things, just following people around. I was always trying to impose a story.\" </p> <p>If he managed to find a niche for himself at the BBC - though call him a \"BBC documentarist\" at your peril - Pawlikowski's unashamed literary instincts have encountered more resistance in the cut-throat world of commercial feature film making. \"A good script is like a work of art in itself,\" he says. \"I've read hundreds of scripts, and good ones are very rare. If the writer has something to say, and a voice, and a plot that matches character, and an emotional trajectory that works, then I'd be an idiot to fool around with it. It's just that few scripts ever are like that. Most scripts are just cliches building on cliches to get from A to B. That sort of script I can write myself.\" </p> <p>It's this impatience with standard film-making practices that has created Pawlikowski's reputation for unconventional working methods - a brew of on-the-spot improvising, ceaseless rewriting, and instinctive decision-making. Pawlikowski's \"method\" is responsible for, among other things, the strong, heartfelt performances, and the inspired exploitation of apparently humdrum backdrops in both Last Resort and My Summer of Love. Pawlikowski himself characterises the way he goes about things as \"like total football - whatever works\". There is an intense period of actor workshopping involved, he says, but he hates the idea of being likened to Mike Leigh. He doesn't work to a set script, but bridles at the idea that he's looking to create some kind of down-and-dirty realism. </p> <p>\"The only reason I keep things open, and try not to pin people down to specific text, is to keep some kind of life on screen. Because what's so horrible in movies is the sense of deadness about the dialogue and the scene. I'm not doing it for authenticity; in fact, I'm aspiring to a more unreal and dreamlike state. I think, as an artist, you should try to achieve something that feels like good literature, but not by literary means. I dread to be compared to all these directors who have a lot of spontaneous emoting and swearing in their films - that is death, it's a cul-de-sac, it doesn't lift the material at all. It's just a cliched reproduction of what we think is normal behaviour.\" </p> <p>It's here that Pawlikowski sounds most Polish, talking hyperactively about the cut and thrust of ideas inside his work. Brits just don't say these sort of things. In any conversation with Pawlikowski, you soon realise that the word \"cliche\" - and his hatred of it - is a big part of his world. Presumably that's why he turned away from the kind of ripped-from-the-headlines topicality of Last Resort and its asylum-seekers, towards the story of a love affair between two teenage girls in smalltown west Yorkshire. For My Summer of Love, he cast two relative unknowns in the lead roles, alongside his Last Resort star Paddy Considine (\"there's something absolutely magnetic about him, a presence, strength\"). Warming to his theme, Pawlikowski starts talking about the importance of the actors in determining the nature of his film. \"The imagination goes into finding the right actors, so if they can create naturalness with an interesting personality, it won't be banal.\" </p> <p>Having such a unique directorial style has its drawbacks too. After the success of Last Resort, Pawlikowski was hired to make the Sylvia Plath biopic with Gwyneth Paltrow attached to star. Eventually, however, he walked out of it, citing the problems of dealing with a valuable Hollywood property's piecemeal schedule. \"Gwyneth was kind of tickled by my ideas, I think. She said to me, whatever works. But there was no person to play Ted in the time available. For a long time I was talking to the producers and they would say: we like your methods, do it the way you want - by the way, she's free in October, three days for rehearsal here, four days there, and we have to cast whoever's available in that period. I thought, this isn't going to work.\" </p> <p>But Pawlikowski has overcome what might have been a disconcerting, career-ending derailment. He's actually been here before: his first feature film, a hardly-seen 1998 effort called The Stringer (inspired fairly overtly by his documentary Tripping With Zhirinovsky, made three years earlier) was something of an embarrassment, not least for its leading lady, Anna Friel. Pawlikowski regained his edge by making Twockers, a TV film that harnessed the small-scale actor-centred style that was a prelude to Last Resort. </p> <p>Now that My Summer of Love has generated such a response, he can be generous. \"Paltrow, she's a good actress. If pushed, she could be really good. Some of the scenes in the film are really good. But she needed a strong man to pin her down, to scare her. If there'd been a really good couple around, like Burton and Taylor, then it could have worked. You need a sense of reality about a relationship rather than just acting out a script. It's so hard to find a big man, a man's man nowadays. That's why I did My Summer of Love: girls are the new men.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> My Summer of Love screens at the Odeon West End, WC1 in the London film festival on October 21 (box office: 0207 928 3232), and goes on general release on October 22.</p>",
  "The continuing row about Silverstone's future as a Formula 1 grand prix circuit is proving to be considerably more exciting than most of the recent Schumacher-dominated races there. Admittedly, that is not saying very much, but the spectacle of Bernie Ecclestone holding the British grand prix to ransom is undeniably both audacious and mesmerising. The fact that other countries are paying higher prices - often with government support - cannot justify Mr Ecclestone's policy of treating the British race like a piece on his global Monopoly board. Yesterday the Brand Synergy consortium, which includes former F1 champion Nigel Mansell, claimed it had saved the Silverstone grand prix - but this was played down by the British Racing Drivers' Club, which said it wanted proof of BS's financial backing. <p>Mr Ecclestone's demand - reported to be \u00a31.5m - is tiny compared with the importance of the motor racing industry to Britain. The design and construction of F1 cars is a multi-billion pound UK success story. In addition, \u00a330m-40m is pumped into the local Northamptonshire economy as a result of the grand prix at Silverstone. There may be a case for the East Midlands Development Agency, a public body, getting involved, as long as a request from Silverstone is treated on the same terms as other applicants. But there is absolutely no case for central government to cut another sleazy deal with Mr Ecclestone following his notorious \u00a31m donation to Labour in 1997 - which had to be returned amid suspicion that it was a million quid pro quo in return for the exemption of F1 from the tobacco advertising ban. </p> <p>Mr Ecclestone - all credit to him - has built up a big international business. That he is now in a position to play governments off against one another is an example of one of the worst aspects of globalisation. It is outrageous that Mr Ecclestone is prepared to turn his back on Silverstone for the sake of \u00a31.5m. He may argue that this is a small sum for a government, but it is also a small sum for a man with billions in the bank. The government must not bend to Bernie.</p>"
