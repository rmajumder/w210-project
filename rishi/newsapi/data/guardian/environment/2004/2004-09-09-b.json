  "<p>Among the identikit sequels and safe movie licences on show at last week's Game Stars Live, one game stood out as a beacon of originality. Evil Genius, shown on the stand of publisher Vivendi Universal, is the second game developed by Camden outfit Elixir - and marks the transition of its creator, Demis Hassabis, 28, from child prodigy to industry bigwig. </p> <p>Hassabis came to prominence aged just 17, when he co-created the hugely successful Theme Park with industry legend Peter Molyneux. Hassabis then headed to Cambridge University, where he picked up a double first in computer science. A chess Master from the age of 12, he won the Mind Sports Olympiad five times between 1998 and 2003 and, after this year's E3 show in May, he participated in a satellite tournament at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. </p> <p>Despite an auspicious start, it has not been plain sailing for Hassabis. He founded Elixir in 1998, but it took the company until last year to release its first game, Republic: The Revolution. Republic fostered a belief that perhaps Hassabis was too clever by half. Although sufficiently innovative to win several awards, it arrived late and over budget, and proved somewhat impenetrable to many of the mere mortals who played it. Evil Genius, however, manages to preserve originality while providing a more mainstream gameplay experience. </p> <p>\"We consciously wanted to do something that was more light-hearted and humorous,\" he says. \"Obviously Republic was quite dark and gritty. We were trying to make a crazy statement that a game can be about politics and so on. So with Evil Genius, we wanted to go back to making a game, as opposed to making some kind of art, I suppose. The concept is be Dr Evil or be Dr No.\" </p> <p>The game casts you as a megalomaniac Bond-style villain aiming to achieve global domination. You must build a base, fill it with traps for enemy spies, research technologies and send out your own spies on specific missions. It is an amusing and absorbing game and, to Hassabis's relief, it has been completed on time and on budget, ready for release at the start of next month. </p> <p>Lack of originality in games from major publishers - who play safe with games they know will sell regardless of merit - is a subject of major debate in the games industry. The Hassabis stance is that of an uncompromising, idealistic developer in an unhelpful climate. </p> <p>\"It's getting scarily hard now to do any original intellectual property (IP). From the point of view of a big publisher that has to come up with predictable quarterly revenues, why should they take the risk on original IP? Especially when consumers are buying Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2 and so on. </p> <p>\"We'll try to fight to the bitter end in terms of originality, but even we may have to do some kind of licence at some point. It's a massive challenge to get a game like Harry Potter out on time on all four platforms, but - from a creative standpoint - you're being a third-class citizen, because you're writing a game that is based on a film that is based on a book. What's the difference between the people who make the game of Finding Nemo and the people who make the soft toys?\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Elixir is working on another original game. \"We can't talk about it, but it's signed to a big American publisher and is a very different game from Republic and Evil Genius, although it is in the strategy/simulation genre. It's more of a story-telling game, and we'll probably announce it before the end of the year.\" </p> <p>Elixir is also developing a prototype of a game that will appear on the next generation of consoles which, with their increased power and graphics abilities, will present a new set of challenges. Hassabis explains: \"You will need armies of animators to make games for the next generation of consoles - I think outsourcing will help. Any independent developer will have to use that for their art resources. I am quite worried about the next generation. Maybe in 10 years' time, when technology is not an issue, things will turn round again, and it will be easier to create an independent game - just like it's easier to create an independent film with a handheld camera and amateur cast.\" </p> <p>Hassabis can now indulge in a rare period of relaxation - although one thing he has planned sounds stressful. He is one of the world's best players of the board game Diplomacy. \"I played in the World Diplomacy Championships two months ago, came sixth out of 250 people, and we won the World Team Diplomacy Championship. Diplomacy is not really relaxing to play - it's like being in a 10-hour business meeting. </p> <p>\"Strangely, the French are the best at it - they have won it for the past four years. But I'm going to play in the European Championship in Munich in October, at the same time as the Oktoberfest.\" </p> <p>Let's hope the latter does not dull his competitiveness in the former.</p>",
  "<p>With the military under ever more pressure, it took many by surprise in July when the Ministry of Defence announced plans to drastically cut back the number of British soldiers. Instead of more troops on the ground, defence secretary Geoff Hoon is leading the charge to use advanced communications technology. </p> <p>The announcement caused outcry. Proponents of what the MoD calls network-enabled capability (NEC) say it will help keep soldiers properly equipped by improving logistics and will help them work more effectively and safely in dangerous situations. </p> <p>\"It allows information to flow,\" said an MoD spokesman. \"The technology allows you to do things you couldn't do before.\" </p> <p>The defence command paper released by Hoon in July - which publicised plans to close or merge foot regiments, scrap Royal Navy ships and ditch RAF squadrons - defines NEC as \"the coherent integration of sensors, decision-makers and weapons systems.\" </p> <p>Government IT projects do not always have shining reputations, but Giles Ebbutt, the editor of Jane's C4I Yearbook, says that much of the technology in the plan already exists. He believes it is entirely reasonable that the rest should be ready by 2010. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt you need the capability they are introducing. If we're going to continue to be a viable partner in any meaningful coalition, we need to be able to do these things. How you gain that capability is then a matter for political judgment.\" </p> <p>The MoD's paper anticipates the UK working regularly with the US military, and the Pentagon is already particularly keen on what it calls network-centric warfare. </p> <p>Some critics say NEC is extremely useful in high intensity operations such as full-scale war, but less useful for work such as distributing aid. With low intensity operations becoming increasingly common, some fear that replacing troops with complex technology will weaken the capability on the ground and endanger important peacekeeping missions. </p> <p>\"Commanders in Iraq last year said they didn't see how some swanky new technology would help. What helped was people on the ground patrolling,\" says Francis Tusa, editor of the Defence Analysis newsletter. </p> <p>He says this particularly applies to plans to create \"digitised battlespace\" by tracking the location of all vehicles and individuals on a battlefield. The MoD announced a pilot of this Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System two months ago. </p> <p>Tusa says that a peacekeeping \"battlefield\" can contain tens of thousands of vehicles and individuals, and that the difference between neutrals and enemies may be their intentions rather than any physical sign. He thinks commanders could become reliant on digitised battlespace software, leading to the problem \"that the default is 'shoot and sort out later'\". Such a move could turn neutral civilians into sworn enemies, threatening the sanctity of peacekeeping operations and placing troops in greater danger than ever. </p> <p>Another problem is that such low intensity operations are by their nature more labour intensive, and NEC is being introduced as personnel is being cut. Iraq's high-level warfare took a matter of days, while the effort to bring civil peace and order is a much more long-term engagement. </p> <p>\"If you're doing peacekeeping work, you don't always need hi-tech capability,\" says Paul Keetch, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. \"What you need is a huge number of infantry and transport aircraft.\" </p> <p>Others, however, see networked communications as essential in low intensity work. \"People think soldiers on the ground don't need technology when winning hearts and minds,\" says Ellie Goldsworthy, a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. \"But they need to be able to react quickly, and getting the right information at the right time enables them to do that.\" </p> <p>She believes her use of computer technology was important in her postings on peace support operations in the Balkans, where situational awareness and reliable communications were crucial. For her, the problem with NEC is in presentation: it is not explained, for example, as a way of tracking equipment more accurately. </p> <p>\"Geoff Hoon sells it so dreadfully,\" she says. \"If he explained that investment in new technology would mean body armour would stand a better chance of getting to the soldiers who needed it, he might get a warmer reaction.\" </p> <p>But could soldiers become over-reliant on technology? Could they become so much a part of a network that they are useless when disconnected? Goldsworthy says British military training avoids the dependence on technology. \"Every soldier has training for what happens when the radios go wrong. There's never a total reliance on technology.\" </p> <p>But Tusa points out that some US units no longer teach map reading, since soldiers rely on global positioning systems. \"A map with a bullet hole is slightly soiled, but a computer with a bullet hole is an expensive paperweight,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Defence Command Paper</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/67egp\">http://tinyurl.com/67egp</a></p> <p><strong> MoD press release on JETTS</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?I60D25B39\">http://masl.to/?I60D25B39</a></p> <p><strong> RUSI articles and opinions</strong> <a href=\"http://masl.to/?B2FC31B39\">http://masl.to/?B2FC31B39</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Best foot forward </strong><br> </p> <p>If everyone in the world lived like the average person in Britain, we would need three planets to sustain us. On average, Britons use up 5.4 hectares of the earth's natural resources every year, well above the global average of 3.4 hectares. According to Earthday, an environmental pressure group, the Earth can only sustain 1.8 hectares per person. So how do you know when you are consuming too much?

  "<p>Businesses that want to use Linux can find it daunting to choose one distribution or \"distro\" from the dozens available. Most come with the key tools needed to build and run a server, whether it's for email, files or web serving. They also provide many of the tools needed to run a desktop PC, from office suites and multimedia packages to email tools and organisers. But business users also need to think about continuity, compatibility and support. </p> <p>Indeed, support is one of the key issues facing businesses that want to deploy Linux. As with a proprietary operating system, Linux administrators will need to debug interactions among free, commercial and in-house applications, and get all their software working with new hardware. It's possible to purchase support contracts from most major Linux vendors on a subscription basis, or hire consultants to help get systems up and running. </p> <p>The subscription approach is attractive as it helps ensure that distro vendors continue to survive - not guaranteed with \"free\" software - while making sure you always have access to the latest stable code. </p> <p>Support involves far more than just the operating system. You also need to consider applications and hardware. For example, Oracle recommends a Dell and Red Hat platform for running its database on Linux - and offers a single support route for all three components. But you may find out, as ITV did, that while you have made a corporate decision to standardise on one Linux distro, some of your key business software is only supported on another. </p> <p>Linux distributions rarely share all the same core code and components, so while it may seem trivial to switch from one version to another, things may be a lot harder in practice. And while you may be able to download various libraries from the net, it's not particularly easy to roll your own distribution - especially if it means manually maintaining critical service components. </p> <p>When choosing a Linux distribution, then, start with your business requirements, and then see which of the distributions offers the features you need. It's a good idea to download trial versions before you even think about deployment. You can then examine the vendor's support policies, the way it handles updates, and its development roadmap. </p> <p>Just keep reminding yourself that when it gets down to the nitty gritty, you're buying a business tool, not a philosophy. </p> <p>The three best known Linux distributions are Red Hat, SuSE and Debian. Red Hat has reorganised its distributions into a selection of subscription packages. SuSE has recently become part of Novell, along with Ximian, an open source software specialist. Debian remains a volunteer-run distribution, with a large number of adherents supporting its commitment to the free software movement. </p> <p>Red Hat, the leading Linux distribution for businesses, caused consternation when it announced it was ending its downloadable distribution, and concentrating on its enterprise solutions, while at the same time moving to a much slower release cycle. This has led to some users moving to other platforms, but the changes have left Red Hat with a solid customer base and a development roadmap that fits more closely with enterprise needs. There's a version of Red Hat for most enterprise niches, from a desktop client to a high-end high performance server. Red Hat has also taken advantage of its position to introduce a Linux-based application server platform, as well as supporting most of the major Java application servers. Red Hat also offers its own set of Java tools. </p> <p>The more daring can work with Fedora Core, from the Red Hat-sponsored Fedora Project. This is a cutting edge distribution, with no support beyond the community. Here, Red Hat tries out features that will eventually find their way into the commercial Red Hat Enterprise distributions. System administrators who want to experiment with new ways of working with Linux will find Fedora attractive, and it will help develop skills that will be needed with future versions of Red Hat. </p> <p>The changes in Red Hat's release policies have led to some interesting effects. Recent data from O'Reilly Books shows that Red Hat is one of the few software products to show a dip in book sales when a new version is released. It's not clear whether this means that fewer organisations are working with Red Hat, or whether experienced administrators no longer need the books to understand the latest features. </p> <p>Germany's SuSE, like Red Hat, offers a range of server solutions and a desktop client. The company has a close relationship with IBM, and this has led to supported installations on most of IBM's server hardware, as well as ports of key IBM intellectual property, including the engineering and scientific libraries needed to develop complex business applications. </p> <p>SuSE has also developed tools for smaller businesses, and offers a groupware platform in the shape of its Openexchange Server. This is an interesting program as it duplicates many of the functions of Microsoft's Exchange Server, as well as offering file sharing features and web-based collaboration. Other SuSE offerings include a retail platform, developed with IBM, that runs on servers and point-of-sale terminals. </p> <p>It's hard to know how many businesses use Debian, as it is only available via downloads or from low-cost CD duplicators. Based on a social contract with the free software community, Debian is as much a philosophy as a set of software, but thefocus is on delivering the best possible selection of free software. Debian can handle everything from home users to enterprise systems, and has stable versions for many processors beyond the traditional x86 Pentium-compatible platform - including Alpha and Sun Sparc processors. Debian users need to rely on informal support networks, or experienced consultants. </p> <p>The big three aren't the only Linux distributions, and you may find the features you're looking for in one of the smaller versions. </p> <p>Mandrake Linux seems to have weathered its recent troubles and is introducing innovative products. Last week, Mandrakesoft revealed its new GlobeTrotter - a portable Linux desktop built around a LaCie 40GB USB 2.0 hard drive. You can plug it into any PC with a USB port, and boot straight into your usual desktop environment. (There's also a boot CD for PCs that do not support USB device booting.) </p> <p>Mandrakesoft also provides server software in the shape of its Corporate Server package, with plenty of configuration wizards to help buyers customise their servers. </p> <p>Several other distributions, including the popular Knoppix, also come as ready to run CD-Roms. Used in conjunction with USB memory sticks, these can give on-the-road employees quick access to internet applications, office tools and email. Just boot the CD, and you're ready to go, with no need to reconfigure the PC or install software. </p> <p>Bootable Linux CDs also provide an easy-to-use PC rescue system, and can help system administrators recover files from machines that have lost their operating system. This is probably one of the major uses for Knoppix. </p> <p>The open source Linux kernel can also be customised for specific tasks, and there are several single-purpose distributions. For example, Freesco is a Linux-based router that runs on basic hardware. You can even use it to manage dial-in modems for your corporate network, exploiting otherwise obsolete hardware. Similarly, SmoothWall Express is an open source firewall built on top of a customised and hardened Linux kernel. </p> <p>You don't have to be a Linux advocate to find this kind of thing extremely useful.</p>",
  "The sober proceedings of the annual conference of water and waste management engineers are getting a lift next week, with a paper on the 21st century phenomenon of \"dogging\", or having sex in front of strangers in public parks. <p>In between a look at the first year's operation of Aberdeen sewage works and an overview of reservoirs in Kazakhstan, hundreds of delegates will be lectured on Sociosexual Use of Public Recreational Space: Managing the Public Sex Environment in Country Parks. </p> <p>The topic has shot to the top of the conference agenda of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management after a survey of park wardens and rangers last year by Richard Byrne, an expert on rural affairs and the environment at Harper Adams University College in Shropshire. </p> <p>He will tell the conference how he was astonished to find that the parks' main problem was not vandalism or fly-tipping but the text- and internet-driven rallies of doggers, who meet in car parks or other riskily public sites for a wide range of goings-on. </p> <p>Delegates will hear that ramblers have come across sex sessions all over the country, often with invited voyeurs equipped with cameras and camcorders, as well as actual participants. More than 20,000 enthusiasts are registered on \"dogging\" websites such as Melanies UK Swingers, which describes the practice as \"anything from putting on a show from your car, to a gangbang on a picnic table\". </p> <p>Dr Byrne said that the practice was a huge expansion of old lovers' lane trysts, driven by the ease of mass anonymous communication through the internet. Texted assignations are also popular. </p> <p>\"The activities focused on in my paper can generally be described as organised multi-partner sexual contacts,\" said Dr Byrne. \"The impact of increasing numbers of them in some country parks can bring many problems ranging from physical damage to the site to a shift in the public's perception of somewhere as a safe recreational environment.\" </p> <p>Dogging venues have also become centres of prostitution, blackmail and theft, in spite of lighthearted references to them in pop songs such as Dogging, by Urockers (\"Sex in public feels so right. Honk your horn. It's a dogger's delight\"). </p> <p>The legal position is a muddle which the new sexual offences bill before parliament is not expected to clarify. </p> <p>Dr Byrne said: \"Although it will outlaw sexual acts in public areas, this will do little for the country parks, which are increasingly seen as unofficial 'tolerance' zones by authorities which want to relocate PSE problems from towns and cities.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bertelsmann, the world's fourth largest media group, is eyeing acquisitions after Bill Clinton's memoirs and top music acts helped triple its half-year profits. </p> <p>Bertelsmann chief executive Gunter Thielen repeated that he was ready to use his group's \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.36bn) warchest to invest in growth. </p> <p>\"Bertelsmann is steadily increasing its scope for investments to strengthen our core businesses and expand in new growth markets,\" Mr Thielen said in a statement. </p> <p>\"We will pursue appropriate opportunities when they become available.\" </p> <p>Strong sales and earnings growth at television broadcaster RTL and music unit BMG helped Bertelsmann, owned by the founder's family and a Belgian investor, to post operating earnings of \u20ac596m in the six months to June, up from \u20ac186m a year ago. </p> <p>Former United States president Bill Clinton's My Life and music acts, including rapper Usher and singer Dido, helped sales increase 3.2% to \u20ac8.1bn after years of decline. Cost cuts across the group also helped. </p> <p>Bertelsmann's chief financial officer, Siegfried Luther, confirmed he expected this year's earnings to rise compared with last year's but declined to give a more bullish outlook, saying it was too hard to predict the Christmas quarter. </p> <p>\"The fourth quarter is very important and experience shows it becomes ever harder to predict. I don't know yet what mood consumers will be in, or how exactly advertising revenues will come in,\" he said, adding that restructuring charges at BMG would also weigh on earnings in the second half of the year. </p> <p>Net profit after minority interests was \u20ac446m in the first half, four times more than a year ago, boosted by the sale of a New York office building and other special items. </p> <p>BMG, which last month merged with Japanese electronic group Sony's subsidiary, Sony Music, had \u20ac74m in earnings, up from a loss last year, as sales rose 10% despite the still weak global music market. </p> <p>Sony BMG, of which Bertelsmann owns 50%, is now the world's second largest record label. It won 10 of 21 MTV Video Music Awards last month, including the top three awards, given to Outkast, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Usher. </p> <p>Bertelsmann's Random House book publishing unit almost tripled earnings to \u20ac31m, helped by the Clinton memoirs and bestseller The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown. </p> <p>Magazine publisher Gruner + Jahr lost sales and earnings due to asset sales and spending on new magazines in France. Printing and services unit Arvato, which last week agreed to merge its gravure printer with German rivals, increased sales and earnings. </p> <p>Sales at loss-making book club unit Direct Group fell due to currency effects and a subdued German economy. </p> <p>RTL Group, Europe's largest TV broadcaster, which contributes more than half of Bertelsmann's earnings, posted a 57% rise in underlying earnings last week. Bertelsmann is currently unlisted.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC is hoping that the Olympics effect will boost ratings for Superstars, the sports gameshow that was revived last year to a muted reception, and has signed up teenage boxing sensation Amir Khan to appear. </p> <p>A huge hit for BBC1 in the 1980s, when the show made a star of champion Brian Jacks, who appeared alongside footballers such as Kevin Keegan and other sports heroes of the day, will return later this year. </p> <p>The corporation has signed up Khan, the 17-year-old boxing prodigy who won a silver medal in the Athens games, and a host of other British medallists to compete in the show. </p> <p>\"I want to do better than the boxers who appeared last time and I'm confident that I can do well - I'd really like to make it through to the final,\" said Khan. </p> <p>The BBC's director of sport, Peter Salmon, recently said he hoped Khan would keep his promise to remain amateur until the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, allowing the BBC to hold on to the rights to his fights. </p> <p>Other gold medallists who will take part in the men's competition include cyclists Bradley Wiggins and Chris Hoy, Marlon Devonish from the sprint relay team, and Ed Coode and Steve Williams from the coxless four rowing team. </p> <p>They will compete alongside last year's winner, Du'aine Ladejo, and other sportsmen, including fellow athletes Jamie Baulch and Iwan Thomas across a range of disciplines such as swimming, kayaking, sprinting and cycling,</p> <p>\"We've been working flat out to persuade the best of Britain's Olympic talent to appear in the show. Competition for them post-Olympics has been immense. </p> <p>\"We're delighted that they're committed to Superstars and we're very excited that viewers at home will see them in action in a very different environment,\" said Cathy Jones, producer for TWI, which is making the show for the BBC. </p> <p>In the women's competition, Denise Lewis, a gold medal winner in Sydney in 2000, will take on last year's joint winners, swimmer Zoe Baker and snowboarder Lesley McKenna, among others. </p> <p>The second series of the revived show, which will again be fronted by Johnny Vaughan and Suzi Perry, will be filmed in La Manga this September. It will remain true to the original format but one new innovation is the introduction of a \"masters\" show. </p> <p>This will see veterans such as football legends John Barnes and Bryan Robson competing alongside boxer Barry McGuigan, athlete John Regis and rugby players Jonathan Davies, Martin Offiah and Ellery Hanley. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life before</strong><br></p> <p>The simplest way to describe how handy I am is to list the full repertoire of jobs I have ever tackled in the name of \"home improvements\" or DIY (this won't take long):</p> <p>Changing a lightbulb (the most frequent and, even if I do say so myself, the most successful of jobs completed); changing a three-amp fuse in a plug; drilling a hole into a wall, then pushing (or hammering) in a Rawlplug; screwing a screw into said Rawlplug, then hanging something on it (preferably as close to true as possible); hammering a nail into a creaky floorboard (and successfully avoiding central heating pipe below); painting a bedroom with a roller and tray in under two days (even though, as Jane was keen to point out, I had \"missed a bit\" more than once).</p> <p>However, my proudest moment deserves special mention. I recently decided to step up a level after being given one of those DIY reference books the size of a toolkit. The chapter on \"Shelving with Confidence\", or some such, spurred me into attempting a floor-to-ceiling MDF bookshelf in the backroom. Armed with only a borrowed jigsaw, workbench, spirit level, three large sheets of MDF and sharpened pencil I emerged triumphant from the room three weekends later. I can boast that my handiwork is still standing today.</p> <p><strong> The Audit</strong><br></p> <p>The auditors: <strong> Hannah Berry</strong> , writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <strong> Mike Childs</strong>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <strong> Renee Elliott</strong>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops.</p> <p>The auditors' visit to our home coincides with Jane and me finalising plans to undertake some major building work. Ever since we moved in we have wanted to reposition our pokey bathroom upstairs. By being downstairs next to the kitchen, it means that simple tasks such as brushing teeth or spending a penny in the night seem like major expeditions. Hardly up there as life's great hardships, I know, but we also crave enough space in the kitchen for a table and chairs which would transform the way we use the house - especially with a baby.</p> <p>The trade-off is making the back room a bit smaller to fit the new bathroom next door. And with everything to be chopped and changed so much - including the plumbing and electrics - we plan to have new kitchen units and a bathroom suite too. Of course, these plans do not include me dirtying my hands: a builder is to be hired instead.</p> <p>Mike's first reaction to our plans is \"why?\". \"Why do all these jobs need doing?\" he asks. \"Could you find ways of making changes that do not involve a complete refit? In the bathroom, for example, does the whole suite need replacing? And couldn't you update the kitchen by simply replacing the work surfaces or changing cupboard doors? Knocking down a wall and installing a new kitchen and bathroom are all fairly major projects, which will involve a lot of work, create a fair bit of waste and demand lots of new material. But taking an environmentally friendly approach is possible, given a bit of careful thought about what really needs to be done and what materials are going to be used.\"</p> <p>Once the auditors start discussing the best course of action, two main themes emerge: the toxicity of the materials used, and their sustain-ability. The principal concern is what materials to use in the kitchen. Hannah, for example, stresses that it is important to research what materials are used to make the kitchen units.</p> <p>\"Timber is the second most widely traded commodity,\" she says. \"Consequently, half the world's original forest cover has been destroyed in the past 40 years, and continues to be depleted at a rate of 26 hectares a minute. Every day, rainforest species are lost for ever. Britain's wood consumption is 60-70% higher than what it produces. Therefore, after reclaimed wood - 500,000 tonnes of reusable wood is thrown away each year in Britain - the next best option is UK-grown timber certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC), which oversees environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial forest management.</p> <p>Chipboard and MDF tend to be made of waste wood, but low-formaldehyde versions are better due to the air pollution these materials cause. Despite the problems with timber, though, it is the best environmental choice for many jobs. Plastics are highly energy-intensive compared to timber and largely not recyclable.\"</p> <p>That's a relief, as both Jane and I are having trouble imagining a solid plastic kitchen. But the thought of a solid wood kitchen isn't too appealing either, given how expensive it would be.</p> <p>Mike puts us at ease, though, by explaining that the FSC does not just certify fancy handcrafted wooden kitchens but also many everyday kitchen items such as flat-pack kitchen units, work surfaces, and doors.</p> <p>\"The FSC logo is the only way of guaranteeing that your wood is from a well-managed forest,\" he says. \"And if there is a choice, local FSC timber is always better, as shipping timber around the planet contributes to climate change. Look at <a href=\"http://www.goodwoodguide.com\">www.goodwoodguide.com</a> before you buy.\"</p> <p>Renee asks us what flooring we intend to use. \"If you want a timber floor, think of bamboo that grows quickly, instead of hardwoods that take years and years to establish. There are also companies, such as Crucial Trading and Fired Earth, that stock natural flooring such as coir matting, cork floors and terracotta tiles.\"</p> <p>The expression on Jane's face suggests she has probably already ruled out using either coir matting or bamboo on our floors. However, she's more concerned about the auditors' talk of toxicity, with most of it focusing on paints. \"Paints and varnishes can contain high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which contribute to ground-level ozone and have been linked to allergic reactions,\" says Mike. \"It is possible to avoid VOCs by opting for water-based paints, and most paint manufacturers now produce low-VOC products as well.\"</p> <p>Hannah isn't so sure that we should choose such paints. \"Water-based synthetic paints can contain harmful chemicals like alkyl phenols and vinyl resins, even if low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The indoor environment can be 10 times more polluted than outside due to a cocktail of off-gassing toxic chemicals used in many DIY products. According to the World Health Organisation, professional painters and decorators face a 40% higher than average risk of lung cancer. The production of a tonne of ordinary paint also results in 10 tonnes of waste, much of it toxic.</p> <p>\"All this is exacerbated by the fact that we tend to buy more DIY equipment than we need. For example, up to a quarter of all paint sold is never used, and an electric drill gets 15 minutes of use, on average, in its lifetime.\"</p> <p>Look for natural alternatives, says Renee. \"Nutshell and Lakeland produce natural and organic paints and stains with plant-based dyes, solvents and fillers. In general, watch DIY products such as glues, fixings and other general building materials. Plywood, for example, can contain formaldehyde - a \"probable carcinogen\", according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Instead go for soft-, medium- and hard-board that have no synthetic glues.\"</p> <p><strong> Life after</strong><br></p> <p>Our builder just laughed when we repeated what the auditors had told us. \"That's going to cost you a fortune,\" he said gleefully. \"But if that's what you want, that's what we'll do.\"</p> <p>Renee had recommended that we find a builder through the Association for Environment-Conscious Building. We duly looked up AECB builders in the London area. There were only three, all of them a long way from where we live.</p> <p>We'd already found a builder who had been personally recommended. We'd seen his work in another house, and he'd provided a quote we were happy with. We decided that rather than suffering the headache of sourcing a new builder, we should try to guide the builder we'd already chosen towards the materials and techniques recommended by the auditors.</p> <p>It has to be said, this route largely turned out to be a mistake. We totally underestimated how entrenched our builder was in doing things his way. I can't really blame him - being constantly told how to do things can grate, but he tended to laugh off nearly all of our suggestions. A good example was what to do with all the waste that was created when he ripped out the old kitchen, bathroom and adjoining wall. My intention was to pick through it and look for anything worth salvaging. But I came home from work one day to find everything in a skip outside our house. OK, I thought, I'll go through it myself, but within a few hours flytippers had got word of our half-filled skip and it was quickly filled with old keyboards, tyres and other rubbish before I got the chance. My only success was salvaging some glass shelves, radiators, and two doors - I think a passer-by must have taken the other goodies such as the taps and bath. All the rest - admittedly most of it rubble and splintered chipboard from the old kitchen - was, sadly, destined for landfill.</p> <p>We did have successes though, but only when we took the initiative rather than leaving it up to the builder. In the bathroom, for example, we got him to install a loo with a low-volume flush. We also resisted the huge temptation to get a power shower, instead opting for one with a thermostatic valve, ensuring we did not waste precious water by fiddling with the hot and cold taps trying to get the desired temperature.</p> <p>In the kitchen, we insisted the builder install a dedicated cupboard for the recycling bin. We surprised ourselves, too, by managing to find a kitchen approved by the FSC. Better still, it was also one of the cheapest, extinguishing our usual fears that whatever the auditors recommended would always be the most expensive option. And we didn't need to look far for it either; we found the kitchen quite by accident on the B&amp;Q website while browsing for designs. Right by the price, in small print, was what we were looking for: the kitchen's carcass, doors and worktops were all \"certified to FSC standards\".</p> <p>By the time the kitchen and bathroom were fitted, the job was already running over budget so we decided to save money and decorate it ourselves. Our intention was to use the eco-paints the auditors had praised, but they were off-puttingly expensive. For example, we needed a five-litre pot of paint for the walls in the kitchen, but when we started researching some of the brands we found the price could easily top \u00a350 a pot - even \u00a380 on one occasion. It just seemed to be too much when we could find a water-based, low-VOC equivalent for under \u00a320. So we opted for this compromise and made a resolution to avoid oil-based gloss paints for the woodwork given the fumes they give off and that you need white spirit - extremely environmentally damaging, said the auditors - to clean the brushes. We also vowed to donate any leftover paint to the local council's paint recycling scheme, as was also recommended by the auditors.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leo's next report, domestic utilities, is in two weeks</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a></p>",

  "<p>On the morning I went to see Sudan: Ancient Treasures, an exhibition at the British Museum surveying the archaeology of Africa's biggest country over the past 200,000 years, the latest news from Sudan was that 3,000 more people had been driven from their homes. One million have already been displaced, and refugees say that up to 55,000 people have been killed by the Arab Janjaweed militias who attack villages following air raids. The Sudanese government denies any involvement. The UN cannot agree on whether this is genocide or merely a humanitarian catastrophe. </p> <p>It's difficult to see how weathered sandstone monuments to the pharaohs and the kings of Kush, Christian paintings and Muslim armour from the battle of Omdurman can possibly help us to understand these events. How does going to see an exhibition in tranquil Bloomsbury, then visiting the museum shop or chatting about the Janjaweed over coffee, achieve anything? </p> <p>The exhibition is free, but visitors are asked to make a donation to Oxfam and Save the Children. It's also accompanied by lectures, study days and ethnographic displays claiming a contemporary relevance. Neil MacGregor, the BM's director, sees this as part of an ambitious attempt to make the museum an enlightened centre of enquiry, debate and global understanding. It seems a lot to load on an exhibition, on history, on museums. </p> <p>The British Museum proposes to tell us something about what is happening in Egypt's immense southern neighbour by collecting objects that date from the paleolithic era - Homo Erectus first settled this part of Africa 300,000 years ago, and one of the earliest grinding stones was found here - up to the 19th century. Such an all-encompassing attempt to know a place is in the Enlightenment tradition of Napoleon's Description of Egypt, the mammoth tome illustrating every aspect of Egyptian archaeology and natural history created by French scholars. In his famous 1978 book Orientalism, Edward Said argued that all such totalising European claims to knowledge of the other are a form of power over what is so easily, so elegantly described. Massively influential, Said's book, whatever its original value, has become a pernicious block on thought. This exhibition demonstrates why. It quietly asserts that knowledge might actually be a good thing. </p> <p>Sand is the first thing you become aware of. So much here is made of red sandstone, soft, worn, almost crumbling before your eyes. That is the big difference between the art of ancient Nubia and the monuments of the pharaohs. The Egyptians preferred to carve their gods and hieroglyphs in granite, hard enough to endure eternity. </p> <p>Egyptian art subtly changed when it was adopted in what is now Sudan. About 3,500 years ago, on a rock above the fourth cataract of the Nile, Turi, viceroy of the Egyptian ruler Tuthmose I, had an inscription carved to mark the limit of the Egyptian empire. At that moment, the builders of the pyramids controlled not just the Mediterranean Nile but a region extending deep into the African continent. A carved stone stela in this exhibition, from the reign of Seti I (c1294-1279BC), shows Seti using a scimitar given him by the god Amen-Ra to smite the Nubians of the upper Nile. The colossal figure of the pharaoh runs forward, raising the curved blade in his right arm, while his left arm holds his dwarfed prisoners by the hair. </p> <p>The first archaeologists to travel beyond the fourth cataract of the Nile took images like this at face value. In 1834 an Italian doctor, Giuseppe Ferline, reached the pyramids of Meroe. Sudan's pyramids are darker, smaller, more narrow at the base than Egyptian ones - and there are more of them. Ferline tore into the tomb of a Kushite queen, and the treasures he brought back to Europe were sensational. He was following a trail blazed by imperialism - Egyptian imperialism. In 1819 Mohammed Ali sent an Egyptian army south to restore the ancient empire on the upper reaches of the Nile. And when Britain seized Egypt, becoming its de facto governors in 1882 after getting nervous about the Suez Canal, we inherited its Sudanese colony. Under British rule, archaeologists started to investigate sites as far as the Blue and White Nile. </p> <p>The image of ancient Sudan that entered western consciousness was that of Egypt's colonised African neighbour, subdued by a stronger, Mediterranean culture. But this exhibition explodes that myth of Nubia as passive recipient of Egyptian culture. The relationship between Egypt and the kingdom of Kush or Kerma was so complex, it hurts your head. </p> <p>Any serious archaeology exhibition is difficult, and this one insists on complexity. You spend a lot of time trying to understand timelines. There were powerful kings in Sudan before contact with Egypt developed. Like the pharaohs, the rulers of Kerma expressed their power through elaborate funerals. Instead of building pyramids, they practised human sacrifice: sometimes hundreds of servants would be buried alive with their master. </p> <p>Far from simple conquest, the relationship between ancient Egypt and Sudan was one of exchange and influence. Not only did independent rulers survive, they eventually took over Egypt itself. From 1650 to 1550BC, a weak Egypt was dominated by the rulers from the south. It was after this period that the New Kingdom (1550-1069BC) struck back and conquered the land of Kush. But by then it was almost irrelevant who ruled who; culturally, this was one region. </p> <p>There is no easy way of telling, in this exhibition, what is purely \"Egyptian\" and what is Kushite. Only the stone tells you these marvellous sculptures are Sudanese. The desert is in them. Magnificent things: a seated statue of a ruler who might be Shelley's Ozymandias, but is in fact Amenhotep I. A sandstone lion. A four-sided relief from the Temple of Amun at Naga, orange, hot, with falcon-headed Horus and ibis-headed Thoth. British eyes, though, are bound to fix on one of the very last exhibits: armour removed from the battlefield of Omdurman in 1898. </p> <p>One thing British people know about Sudanese history is this. In 1883 Charles Gordon was sent by the prime minister, William Gladstone, to supervise a complete withdrawal from \"the Sudan\". When Britain took over Egypt's colony, we also took over its problems. A powerful religious leader, the Mahdi, who dreamed of purifying Islam and replacing the rulers of the Ottoman empire, led a holy war that convinced the British it was wiser to pull out. But Gordon had his own ideas. He stayed in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and died with its garrison. </p> <p>On September 2 1898, the British empire took its belated but efficient revenge when General Kitchener led a new invasion of Sudan. An army loyal to the Mahdi's memory and ideas, armed with medieval weapons, charged Kitchener's maxim guns at Omdurman. More than 11,000 Islamic holy warriors died. British deaths totalled 48. The chain mail captured at Omdurman displayed here could have been worn at Lepanto, when in fact it was used on the eve of the 20th century against machine guns. </p> <p>In the African galleries, a special display includes more material from Omdurman: fabric horse armour with triangular polychrome patterns, a giant wooden drum that beat the Mahdist army to its massacre. All of these are just objects now, dead, encased, as ancient as the decaying sand faces of the rulers of Kush. History is an immense and terrible thing in this exhibition. </p> <p>So what does it achieve? Obviously, it offers no answers. You don't come away suddenly understanding why the Janjaweed militias want to drive villagers out of their homes (to accept the mildest description of what is happening in Sudan). What you do understand is the subtlety and plurality of the human story. Archaeology in Africa has proved there really is a coherent \"human story\"; we all begin in Olduvai Gorge in Kenya, about 2m years ago.The story this exhibition tells is much shorter: a mere 200,000 years. In this time, kingdoms and religions rose and fell in the sand, but a single thread of human creativity - as well as violence - persisted. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sudan: Ancient Treasures is at the British Museum, London WC1, until January 9 2005.

  "<p>As the biggest global brands, McDonald's, Coca-Cola or Nike might have expected to win the prize as the world's most talked about brands, but a new survey shows that accolade goes to luxury car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz.</p> <p>Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz is the brand most owners talk about and recommend to friends, according to the first global study into the value consumers attach to global brands.</p> <p>The NOP study, which investigated 49 global brands consumers most engage with, put the German car maker at the top of the list, with 60% of its customers actively recommending its cars.</p> <p>Mercedes' arch-rival BMW came second, with 53% of its customers falling into the \"brand ambassador\" category, followed by Toyota with 51%. </p> <p>US network CNN came bottom of the list of 49 brands, with 68% of consumers who watched the channel indicating they were indifferent. In contrast, just 12% of Mercedes owners indicated they were apathetic towards the marque.</p> <p>The BBC also scored poorly, with 56% of global respondents saying they would not recommend it to friends.</p> <p>Banks, credit cards and financial institutions also register low brand advocacy scores. </p> <p>Mastercard, American Express and the world's biggest bank, Citibank, all managed indifferent scores of over 50%. Just 12% of Citibank customers said they were brand positive about the institution.</p> <p><strong>Word of mouth now taking place of advertising</strong><br></p> <p>The idea that brand advocacy is a more persuasive influence on buying decisions than traditional marketing techniques, such as TV advertising and PR, has been gaining increased credence over the last few years.</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble recently revealed it is pouring huge amounts of money into marketing products through word of mouth. </p> <p>It routinely sends free samples of its products to celebrities in the hope that the stars will mention the product's name in interviews in celebrity magazines. And over the last two years the company has contacted 200,000 women to offer free Pampers products, hoping they would catch on through word-of-mouth.</p> <p>NOP said its own research showed that most people regard word-of-mouth recommendations as the best source of information about prospective purchases, placing twice as much value on personal recommendations than on adverts or reading newspapers and magazines.</p> <p>\"Once a brand strikes an emotional relationship with its customers, people talk about the brand and this is very powerful,\" said Tim Wragg, the global director of NOP World's customer management arm. </p> <p>Though car manufacturers dominated the survey, filling the top three places, the NOP study reveals that gadgets and cosmetic products are also popular with the consumers who buy and use them. </p> <p>The mobile phone maker, Nokia, was fourth on the list, followed by electronics giant Sony. Estee Lauder meanwhile was the top-ranked cosmetics brand at number six, followed by Lancome then Clinique.</p> <p>NOP said the products which purchasers were least inclined to actively promote were financial services and television channels. </p> <p>NOP said the relatively poor showing of financial brands was due to their low visibility, market dominance by a few big brands with little to differentiate between them and the fact that financial products tended to be functional rather than aspirational purchases.</p> <p>\"Brands must be trustworthy and deliver on their promises to customers,\" Mr Wragg said. \"Beyond that, brands should be looking to engage consumers emotionally, and encourage a buzz around their brand.\"</p> <p>The agency interviewed over 30,000 13 to 65-year-olds in 30 countries worldwide to obtain the results, undertaking around 1000 interviews with active purchasers or \"brand advocates\" in each country.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged at 4.75% today amid signs that the housing market has cooled as a result of steadily rising borrowing costs.</p> <p>Today's decision by the Bank's monetary policy committee was widely expected. All 50 analysts polled by Reuters last week said the MPC would do nothing this month as the economy already appeared to be slowing down in response to the rise in interest rates that began last November. </p> <p>Analysts now believe that the current interest rate cycle is at - or at least close - to its peak. </p> <p>\"On balance though, we still expect one more 25 basis point interest rate hike this year [in November] and a final 25 basis point hike around next spring, taking interest rates up to a peak of 5.25%,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>If that turns out to be the case the top of this interest rate cycle would be much lower than the 6% peak of the last rate cycle, which was reached in February 2000 or the 7.5% reached in June 1998. </p> <p>After five interest rate rises from the 38-year low of 3.5%, consumer spending and the housing market have finally shown signs of coming off the boil. The Halifax bank reported that prices fell for the first time in two years in August, while the Nationwide building society reported just a tiny increase.</p> <p>The last Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors report on the market told a similar story while estate agents have been complaining of slumping sales and builders say activity is easing. The Bank of England's own data on mortgage approvals - loans agreed but not yet made - has also shown a steep drop.</p> <p>But there have been false dawns before when it seemed that house prices and consumer had slowed, only to pick up again. Moreover, the Bank has to remain on its guard against inflationary pressures as the economy is still growing vigorously, analysts warned.</p> <p>\"Future inflationary risks stem from the fact that the economy is still growing above trend while the output gap may well have now disappeared,\" said Mr Archer. \"We still think that the slowdown in the housing market may yet turn out to be more drawn out and less clear cut than many now expect, with periodic bursts of life in the market particularly likely if people start to become more confident that interest rates are now near to peaking.\"</p>",

  "Michael Howard shifted his party sharply to the right yesterday when he brought the leading Eurosceptic John Redwood back into the shadow cabinet after a four-year exile. <p>The surprise move, which gives the former leadership contender the newly-created role of shadow secretary of state for deregulation, coincides with the departure of two modernisers, John Bercow and Damian Green. </p> <p>Conservative central office said both had been offered alternative jobs to their international development and transport briefs. </p> <p>Both chose to stand down, suggesting unease with the direction the party is taking. </p> <p>Mr Green, who was demoted from his shadow cabinet post when Mr Howard became leader, said he wished \"to play a wider role in developing Conservative ideas which will make us attractive to a wider section of the electorate\", adding: \"I can do this better from the backbenches.\" </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said the reshuffle showed the party was becoming more extreme. \"He has sacked the remaining Tory modernisers who were seeking to claw their party back to the centre ground and replaced them with figures from the Tory hard right,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Howard also brought Nicholas Soames, the shadow defence spokesman who has been vociferous in attacking Oliver Letwin's planned cuts, back into the shadow cabinet. </p> <p>David Cameron, a leading member of the so-called Notting Hill set - a group of Tory bright young things - and tipped as a future leader, is also rewarded with a shadow cabinet position while keeping his job as head of policy coordination. The move boosts the number of shadow cabinet places from 14 to 17. </p> <p>Among the other switches Alan Duncan, the only openly gay Tory MP, moves from constitutional affairs to secretary of state for international development, and the modernising Tim Yeo, the shadow secretary of state for environment and transport, takes on Mr Green's transport spokesmanship - perhaps an admission that the decision to slim down the shadow cabinet by giving spokesmen delegated briefs was impractical. </p> <p>Notting Hill member George Osborne was promoted to shadow chief secretary of the Treasury and Julie Kirkbride demoted from shadow culture secretary. </p> <p>The overwhelming impression of the shake-up was that Mr Howard was, in the words of one Tory insider, \"lurching very significantly to the right\". </p> <p>It follows criticism that he has taken the easy option of pandering to Tory hardliners with a summer of headline-grabbing speeches attacking political correctness and the compensation culture. </p> <p>But it is the promotion of Mr Redwood, 53, which is seen as the greatest indication of Mr Howard's intentions. </p> <p>The former Welsh secretary, who challenged John Major, and then stood for the leadership in 1997, has been on the backbenches since being sacked by William Hague. </p> <p>In a statement, Mr Howard said: \"While the endless bickering between the prime minister and his chancellor has split the Labour party and paralysed the government, a united Conservative party is continuing to get on with the job.\"</p>",
  "<p>1. Travelling tips </p> <p>Walk or cycle wherever you can to save money (this will have the added benefit of keeping you fit). Some universities have hitching posts - one on campus and one in town in the case of Lancaster. If you take public transport in London, the cheapest option is to pre-pay. Pre-paid bus tickets save you 30p per journey and tube journeys are up to 40p less with an Oyster card, although travelcards are cheaper if you make regular journeys. In Manchester, a young person's bus travelcard is \u00a39.45 for a week or \u00a335 for a month; that's \u00a33.55 and \u00a310 respectively less than the adult fare. </p> <p>For longer journeys, book train tickets well in advance - at least seven days for the cheaper apex tickets.

Also check out all-you-can-eat buffets, and remember that in happy hours food's often cheaper as well as alcohol.</p> <p>3. Eating in</p> <p>Cooking meals from scratch is best for your budget and health. \"Students can save on food spending by learning to cook before they leave home, bringing supplies with them, using low-cost supermarkets or local markets, buying fresh food - it's usually cheaper than convenience stuff - and sorting out a weekly menu with the people they live with,\" says Lancaster University spokeswoman Beth Broomby. </p> <p>\"Make friends with your local baker, greengrocer, fishmonger and butcher,\" adds Maddy Heil of <a href=\"http://www.thesite.org\">TheSite.org</a>, an advice website for young people. \"Ask them about which ingredients are good value for someone on a tight budget.\" This extends to lunchtime - homemade sandwiches save you about \u00a32 a day. </p> <p>4. Supermarket sweep</p> <p>Instead of expensive well-known brands, buy supermarket own brands or better still their low-cost ranges. Buying Sainsbury's low priced baked beans instead of Heinz's saves you 27p a tin (420g/415g). </p> <p>\"Never go food shopping when you're hungry,\" advises Maddy Heil. \"You'll end up buying snacks and junk food that you don't need. You should work out what you need before you go, and take a shopping list.\"</p> <p>The best time to shop is when the supermarkets are closing, as they discount foods close to their use-by date. And take advantage of offers: at the time of writing, Sainsbury's had red seal cheese (\u00a33.19) and its own chicken portions (\u00a33.29) on a buy-one-get-one-free offer, saving you \u00a36.48 each time you shop. </p> <p>5. Reducing bills</p> <p>Putting on that thermal vest your mum sent you and adjusting your radiator valves by a notch or two can help reduce your gas bill by 10%. Also reduce bills by turning off lights in empty rooms (saving up to 45%), closing doors and curtains to keep heat in, putting on appliances in the early hours when electricity's cheaper, showering instead of bathing (uses less than half the water and less energy) and installing energy-efficient light bulbs (saving up to 75%). All these measures are good for your pocket and the environment. </p> <p>6. Entertainment for less </p> <p>The internet's the home of cheap music, games and films. For CDs, both <a href=\"http://www.play.com/\">Play.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www12.cd-wow.com/\">CD Wow!</a> are great value. The Libertines is \u00a38.99 on both, but \u00a312.99 at HMV stores - saving you \u00a38 if you buy a couple of CDs a month. Alternatively, borrow friends' CDs (although copying them is illegal), or trade in old CDs, DVDs and games at second-hand shops and high street stores like Game. This is recycling at its best. </p> <p>Of course, things tend to be cheaper on the net generally. \"If you're planning to purchase an item or service, like insurance, there are many online sites that compare prices for items and give excellent money-saving tips,\" says Broomby. See <a href=\"http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/studentsupport/finance/savemoney.htm\">Lancaster Student Support</a> for more.</p> <p>7. Bargain books</p> <p>Books and equipment are must-haves, but you don't need to buy everything new or right away - wait for the course to begin to see what's essential, and use the library as much as possible. Many universities' student unions have second hand stores where you can buy books cheaply and trade your own. You may also be able to share books and equipment with friends, or buy them from students advertising on noticeboards. </p> <p>8. Better budgeting</p> <p>You know you're going to get in debt, but there are ways to minimise the damage. Beth Broomby says: \"It's wise for students to set money aside or to pay for essentials first, like accommodation, when their funding arrives.</p> <p>\"Currently student loans are paid in three termly instalments. Look at the number of weeks this money has to last - you may wish to transfer a weekly amount from one account to another so you know you're spending to plan.\" </p> <p>If you really get into difficulty, there are avenues other than extending or increasing your overdraft. Ms Broomby recommends the university's Access to Learning Fund: \"Applicants are means-tested, but the grants do not need to be repaid.\"</p> <p>Maddy Heil adds: \"Educational charities and trusts often give money to very specific groups of students (up to about \u00a3300). Try your LEA, student union, careers services or Citizens Advice Bureau. Student services also offer scholarships and prizes.</p> <p>\"When you're a student, every little bit of extra cash helps, which is why these extra sources of funding are worth checking out.\"</p> <p>9. Drinking out</p> <p>Student bars are often the cheapest places to drink - you can save \u00a31.50 a pint. Off campus, happy hours in pubs make your money go further. </p> <p>Pub chains like J D Wetherspoon and Yates's are great value all the time. A pint of Carling in Yate's is \u00a31.69 (regions vary), around \u00a31 cheaper than many others. </p> <p>\"Try turning up at the bar later than usual to minimise your drinking time, or kick off with a soft drink to stop you feeling thirsty,\" advises Maddy Heil. </p> <p>10. Drinking in</p> <p>Another option is to drink at home. Sainsbury's has a 24-pack of Carling for \u00a313.99, which works out at just 75p a pint; up to \u00a32 less than bar prices.</p>",
  "<p>You may not be surprised to get cancer if you smoke, or drink too much alcohol, but no one expects to get it from drinking water. Glugging plenty of glasses each day is supposed to be good for us, but now you might want to think twice before turning on the tap. New research, being presented at the British Ecological Society Annual Meeting in Lancaster this week, has revealed that a common fern may be poisoning water supplies all over the world. </p> <p>Bracken is a fern that grows on every continent except Antarctica. Its curling green fronds decorate many British hillsides, dying down and turning a distinctive rusty-red colour through the winter. Due to changes in farming practices over the past hundred years, bracken has proliferated and now it sprawls across much of Scotland and northern Britain. For a long time scientists have known that bracken contains a carcinogenic compound called ptaquiloside (PTQ), but thought it dangerous only if eaten. Now Lars Holm Rasmussen, a scientist at The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Denmark, has shown that PTQs from bracken can enter the water supply and that some of us may be gulping poison every day. </p> <p>Scientists have already shown that the PTQs ingested from eating bracken can increase your chances of getting gastric and oesophageal cancer. </p> <p>In Brazil and Japan young bracken shoots are often used in salads and cooking. \"The young ferns are quite tasty, a bit like asparagus with almonds,\" says Holm Rasmussen. But their toxic qualities are also quite clear, with higher incidences of cancer in both these countries. Now he has shown that eating bracken isn't the only way of ingesting PTQs. </p> <p>Last year Holm Rasmussen measured the concentration of PTQs in water from wells on Danish and Swedish farms, which had lots of bracken growing in the area. To his horror, some of the water had PTQ levels that were over 20,000 times higher than the suggested tolerable levels for environmental carcinogens. </p> <p>The story is likely to be similar for many other farms and villages worldwide, where water is sourced from a bracken-strangled borehole or well. Holm Rasmussen believes that \"hot spots\" of gastric and oesophageal cancer, from Wales to South America, could be explained by the leaching of PTQs from bracken into the water supply. </p> <p>\"PTQ is somewhat like sugar, it dissolves easily and is just as mobile as pollutants like nitrates,\" says Holm Rasmussen. By measuring PTQ levels in soil and soil-water at different times of year, he has shown that the highest levels are found after heavy summer rainfall. \"PTQ is washed out of the bracken fronds by rain and since the bracken has the most biomass in summer, this is when we find the highest concentra tions of PTQ in water,\" he explains. Particularly high levels were found on farms where the water table was high, five to 10 metres below ground. </p> <p>Soil type is also important in helping or hindering PTQ to travel. Sandy soils act like motorways to the water supply, while peat soils and chalks are more like very windy country roads. \"The situation is worst in sandy soils with a pH between five and six. Once the soil gets too acid (peat for example), or alkaline (limestone or chalk for example), then it becomes less mobile and degrades before reaching the groundwater,\" explains Holm Rasmussen. </p> <p>For some people, Holm Rasmussen's discovery is already too late. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s doctors recorded a higher than average incidence of people suffering from gastric cancer in the county of Gwynedd, north Wales. Bracken has really taken a hold in this wild, upland area, creeping up the slopes of Snowdon and the surrounding mountains. Holm Rasmussen believes that the water supply to some of the farms and villages in Gwynedd may have been loaded with PTQs from bracken. </p> <p>To make matters worse, families living on dairy farms may have also been drinking contaminated milk. PTQs can be transferred into milk when cows nibble on bracken, particularly during the spring when the shoots are young and tasty. Farmers often keep the buttermilk for their family, giving it to their children as a healthy drink. This buttermilk will have had the highest proportion of PTQs because it has not been diluted with milk from other, less bracken-infested farms. What is more, PTQs are attracted towards water, so tend to concentrate in the buttermilk, rather than enter the cream, butter and cheese that will have been made from the fat that was skimmed off. </p> <p>Further afield PTQ contamination may also explain gastric and oesophageal cancer hot spots in South America. Small villages and farms are most vulnerable because they often take their water from just one source. \"Bracken certainly could be an environmental factor that explains the raised levels of cancer in certain areas,\" says Holm Rasmussen. </p> <p>What is perhaps more concerning is that it may not just be bracken that we need to worry about. A number of important agricultural crops such as canola and clover already produce toxic natural products with similar structures to PTQ. These toxins are not carcinogenic, but may behave in a similar way in the soil. Furthermore, many of the new GM crops, such as GM maize, are developed with an increased natural defence against pests and weeds, by inserting genes that code for the high production of toxic compounds. \"Some of these toxic natural products have a similar structure to PTQ and I think they will behave in a similar way,\" says Holm Rasmussen. Given that crops are often planted on sandy soils with a high water table, some crops could have an even worse effect on the water supply than bracken. </p> <p>There are no easy solutions to this problem. Farmers and landowners are trying to reduce the amount of bracken, but it is difficult to get rid of and the most effective mechanism is to spray hillsides with a noxious pesticide: not ideal for improving the water supply. Meanwhile, Holm Rasmussen is hoping to carry out more research to discover which GM crops and which type of environment present the greatest threat to our water. In the meantime, don't give up drinking water but do keep trampling down the bracken when you're out for a walk.</p>",
  "<p>'It was built to be a modern, efficient, healthy and, all in all, pleasant place to live. Many Britons find this amusing.\" That's how Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, in their book Good Omens, describe Milton Keynes, a town for which neither heaven nor hell is prepared to take credit. </p> <p>But even with one of the highest densities of roundabouts in the country, not to mention the notorious concrete cows, there are far worse places to live than Milton Keynes. The ridicule it suffers is more a reflection of our instinctive scepticism about the idea of rationally designing a city. </p> <p>Ever since the 19th century, urban design has had an uneasy relationship with science. Amid the grimy horrors of the Industrial Revolution, cities became viewed as inherently undesirable. </p> <p>\"Town planning began as an attempt not to understand cities but to replace them with something better,\" says Bill Hillier, director of the Space Syntax Laboratory at University College London. Idealists like Robert Owen aimed to create a bucolic-industrial utopia, and paved the way for \"balanced urban environments\" such as garden cities. </p> <p>These visions didn't really have any theory. They sounded nicer than the bleak, regimented industrial cities that American social theorist Lewis Mum ford dubbed Coketown in the 1930s, but were they truly more conducive to healthy living? What made the problem particularly hard was that no one was quite sure what urban design was. To some, it was architecture writ large, which meant it should embrace the modernism of Le Corbusier. To others, it was a form of social planning that should be rooted in economics. </p> <p>But the science-based work of Hillier, and his spinoff company Space Syntax, takes a different point of view. If we are going to design good cities, says Hillier, we need first to observe them scientifically to deduce their fundamental rules. He believes good urban planning means relinquishing some control. Cities are organic: they grow, evolve and adapt. \"I wouldn't design a new city,\" Hillier says. \"I'd grow one.\" </p> <p>This perspective goes back to Mumford, who called the growth of a great city amoeboid. He thought the uncontrolled sprawl of big US cities alienating and disempowering. His protege Jane Jacobs argued that we should trust to the self-organising vitality of cities rather than received ideas of what they should look like. </p> <p>In her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jacobs attacked urban renewal schemes as a \"mad spree of deceptions and vandalism and waste\". Her ideas gave rise to the movement known as New Urbanism, which argues that good cities emphasise characteristics such as walkability, diversity, neighbourhood structure and sustainability. Hillier says his work is an attempt to put Jacobs' ideas into scientific form. </p> <p>Some basic ideas of this organic approach to urban design, such as self-organisation and emergence, are now familiar from the area of science dubbed complexity theory. This month, the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment will bring together architects and designers influenced by complexity, such as Charles Jencks, alongside theorists like Hillier and scientists working on complexity in biology and physics. This is not bandwagon-boarding; Hillier has spent more than 20 years looking for emergent laws in the interactions between space, objects and human movement. </p> <p>\"Space is a lawful thing,\" he says. The basic propositions seem obvious: for example, if you place an object in an open space, then the more centrally it is placed, the more it interferes with movement and visibility. By using these first principles, one can understand how different arrangements of buildings shape patterns of movement and social function. </p> <p>Cities, says Hillier, have two main functions. In business areas, space is shaped to encourage movement and encounters between people, generating activity and trade. And there are residential areas, where movement and activity is more controlled. </p> <p>Comparisons between many different cities and cultures seem to point to a universal spatial pattern which Hillier calls \"deformed wheel\": a centre linked by radial \"spokes\" to a surrounding grid of residential areas. This pattern, which can be discerned from Tokyo to Venice to Baltimore, repeats at different scales: in local districts as well as in the whole city. </p> <p>By encouraging free flow of pedestrians and traffic, the spokes promote safety, in contrast to the preference of some planners to \"put us all in cul-de-sacs\". Hillier says that superimposed on this universal structure are culture-specific variations: the complex residential districts of Arabic cities, for example, reflect a stronger separation of public and private life. </p> <p>Space Syntax, headed by Hillier's former student Tim Stonor, used these ideas to plan the reconstruction of Trafalgar Square, previously an island surrounded by traffic in which tourists (but not locals) milled about while trying to avoid pigeon droppings. \"'Suits' used to walk around the edge,\" says Stonor. \"Now, 13 times more Londoners use the square.\" </p> <p>Space Syntax developed the design by combining on-the-street observations of patterns of pedestrian movement with computer modelling that assumed people's movements are controlled primarily by their lines of sight. The company also worked on the redevelopment of King's Cross, and is drawing up schemes to turn Elephant and Castle roundabout into \"the Trafalgar Square of south London.\" </p> <p>Space syntax won't tell us how to make a \"perfect\" city, but can help to avoid bad ones. While using science as a tool for social planning has often been regarded a potential weapon of totalitarianism, Hillier stresses that in architecture and urban design it is merely a handmaid of art. He compares the \"rules\" of space with those of language. </p> <p>\"The laws of language do not tell us what to say, but prescribe the structure and the limits of the sayable.\" Architecture is, he believes, not a battleground but a meeting place. \"It is not half art and half science, but fully art and fully science.\"</p>",
  "<p>The night before last I was at Tate Britain, surrounded by my friends, surrounded by my work, and I felt quite good about the situation. I am 41, I am 100% alive, and I am extremely well represented by the Tate. I know my work is going to be well looked after long after I am gone. This is a very safe, cosy feeling. Even though the work is a permanent collection, the works selected have a curatorial impact. A result of the sharp eye of Gregor Muir, the curator. There are works there that I would never have parted with, for example My Nan. I really love the lavender doll, because the smell reminds me of my nan. It is fantastic - if I miss her, I can just pop down the Tate. </p> <p>People have used the word establishment, well why not, why is the establishment always associated with conservative? I think it is amazing that the Tate is showing my neons \"Is Anal Sex Legal?\" and \"Is Legal Sex Anal?\", which actually, up until recently, was illegal between men and women. The blanket \"Hate and Power What A Terrible Thing\", isn't only about Thatcher, it's about all the kinds of women in the world who behave in a cruel way, who hurt other women and other women's children. I remember being horrified at a rape case where a young girl had held down the victim while egging on her male friends to commit rape. It seemed worse that it was a woman. </p> <p>It is great publicly to be able to get your point across. For me, art has always been about communication. Whether it's film, video, text, neon, sculpture, I am always trying to get a message across. Tate Britain, what a great environment to be in.</p>",
  "George Monbiot prefers life with renewable energy to death by climate change or nuclear proliferation (There is an alternative, September 7). Fair enough. However, he avoids, as usual in this debate, the core question: is the growth in global energy demand we are expecting unlimited? Renewable energy systems, such as plants, animals, even slave labour, involved little growth and no net pollution. But these \"closed loop\" systems declined with industrialisation, and 200 years of economic growth, fuelled by non-renewable hydrocarbon use, has created a global climate crisis. <p>Along with pollution, we have a worsening asymmetry in the global economy, between the one-third of people with 95% of the globally rising purchasing power; and the other two-thirds who have just 5%, and an increasing exposure to the climate changes caused by the wealthy. </p> <p>This divide is growing faster than we are responding. We know that more growth from fossil fuels is not prudent. We need to face the fact that the global asymmetry will not be cured with nuclear power. But with renewable energy, over all growth is not possible, so economic convergence will be forced on us, as the economy undergoes some contraction. The question is whether this is more manageable than continued growth at the cost of solidarity and the climate. </p> <p>Social policy has always involved demand-management. The global security implications of this will be less severe, the sooner the issues are properly addressed.<br> <b>Aubrey Meyer</b><br> Global Commons Institute </p> <p>If sea levels are going to rise, they will do so long before new nuclear power stations have had a chance to make any real impact on carbon emissions. UK policy is to postpone decommissioning of nuclear plants, by which time sea levels may have risen, making decommissioning impossible and increasing the risk of contamination. The first priority must surely be to close down existing sea-level nuclear power stations and move their \"legacy waste\" while there's still time.<br> <b>Craig Sams</b><br> Hastings, E Sussex </p> <p>Yes, the government did deceive the public about nuclear power in 1956, and over more than just the cost. The scheme was called \"atoms for peace\", an early example of the untruths surrounding the development of the nuclear power and weapons industries. Calder Hall was built not as a civil nuclear power station, but to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. Any electricity it produced was a byproduct.<br> <b>Rae Street</b><br> Littleborough, Lancs </p> <p>Monbiot misrepresents the prime minister's position on nuclear power, which is really a sceptical one. When challenged at the Commons liaison committee by Tory MP Robert Key on why he thought the UK was resistant to nuclear power, he said: \"If any of us ... went along to our local constituents and said, 'We're going to build a nuclear power station in the constituency,' how widely supportive do you think they would be?\" </p> <p>When Key retorted: \"That is not very bold leadership, is it?\", Blair replied: \"I will do a deal with you, Robert, we will put one in your constituency first, and you can lead and I will follow.\" This is hardly a ringing endorsement by Blair of new nuclear plants.<br> <b>Dr David Lowry</b><br> Stoneleigh, Surrey </p> <p>George Monbiot's article suggested a remarkable opportunity to make a bold and highly visible witness in many communities.

  "<p>Here we go again. Another hapless British couple moving away from the winter frosts, this time to the Andalusian hills above Malaga. There'll be all the usual problems, the builders will shrug and say \"ma\u00f1ana\" a lot, our couple won't have the language to make things happen, savings will disappear as nothing gets done and British tears will fall on Spanish soil. </p> <p>But wait ... this isn't Our Nightmare in the Sun or whatever those desperate programmes are called. We're not dealing with a beautiful crumbly farmhouse that turns from dream to nightmare. It's <strong> Grand Designs Abroad</strong> (Channel 4), and this one really is totally grand. Gil, an architect, and Hilary his wife buy eight acres of hillside-with-a-view, then, along with their son who's also an architect, they design the house they want to retire to - which turns out to be the house I want to retire to too. </p> <p>Gil's not one to sit around and weep. He knows what he wants and he seems to get it. First he hires Paco who's not a ma\u00f1ana builder but very much a hoy builder, and sometimes alarms his clients with the speed of his work. Not only can Paco lay a 500 sq metre concrete roof in a single sitting, but he's also a prominent member of the local community, has wicked paella parties, and is a very useful man to know. Gil's Spanish improves at roughly the same rate as his house goes up - no, that's not quite true, because in the end the house is perfect. </p> <p>It's a beautiful thing, to watch an imaginative new building go from foundations to fruition - far more interesting than seeing an old finca get a new floor, shutters and a swimming pool, which is what you usually see when a move to Spain is turned into television. There are a few problems. A local law decrees that all buildings must be white. Nonsense, says Gil, and paints his dark blue, mint green and terracotta. And with Paco on your side, you can make anything happen. </p> <p>The end result is stunning. Blocks of concrete and glass cling to the hillside like a little village. It's cool and modern, curved and straight, outrageous and yet it also fits in perfectly to its surroundings. Even the mayor seems quite amused by the eccentric Ingleses and their funny modern house. </p> <p>Presenter Kevin McCloud ponces around throughout, with his fancy shirts and his big, overannunciated adjectives. But - and the ladies may disagree with me on this - there's only one star in this show, and that's the house. Now Hilary and Gil, if you wouldn't mind: hurry up and finish retiring so I can move in ... </p> <p>In <strong> Don't Worry</strong> (Channel 4), my colleague John Vidal, the Guardian's environment editor, is being interviewed by a puppet with a blue face. John's trying to explain that although Shell says it has mended its ways and is committed to saving the planet, that may not be the whole picture. But the puppet's having none of it. \"Don't worry about John,\" he says. \"Cos he's just one of those cynical journalists.\" And to show that John's talking rubbish, he shows an advert - from Shell. </p> <p>And that's how it goes. A puppet talks to someone who knows, and is concerned about the oil industry and the environment. Then the puppet finds \"evidence\", usually in the form of a press release, a statement from the company, or an advert, saying that there's nothing to be alarmed about. Satire, of course. </p> <p>It's a strange idea and its late-night slot suggests that Channel 4 bosses aren't totally convinced, but I quite liked it. It could prove popular with stoned students. </p> <p>In <strong> Who Rules the Roost?</strong> (BBC2), about a couple struggling to juggle twin jobs with twin girls, Joanne throws her spaghetti bolognese on the floor, smashing the bowl, and bursts into tears. I'm sure that's perfectly normal behaviour, but Joanne is the mum. </p> <p>Not having children, I don't suppose I'm really the prime target audience for this one, but I did find it mind-numbingly tedious.

They bicker and mope, and get jealous of each other when one turns out to be better at something than the other (again, it's the parents I'm on about here).

  "<p>The publisher of the Wall Street Journal yesterday warned that the newspaper was likely to suffer a sharp drop in advertising in the current quarter, sparking broader concerns for the health of the market. </p> <p>Dow Jones said profits in the third quarter would at best match the previous year because of the unexpected shortfall at the Journal, its leading title. </p> <p>Third-quarter advertising volumes at the Journal are expected to fall in the mid-to high single-digit percentage range from a year ago, a reversal of previous forecasts of growth in low single-digit percentage figures. </p> <p>The company cited particular weakness in travel, retail, technology and general business-to-business advertising. </p> <p>The biggest decline during August was at the Wall Street Journal Europe, where advertising volume dropped 17.4% per issue. In the US the decline was 0.1%. The company said the declines would be sharpest in September, however. </p> <p>Newspaper advertising had been gradually returning to steady growth. According to Zenith Optimedia, ad spend in American newspapers had been sliding for years but picked up from $45.3bn in 2002 to $46.2bn in 2003. </p> <p>Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Edward Atorino said the Journal figures were a worrying sign. \"These are categories that represent fairly broad sectors of the economy. It could mean bad news for some of the big city newspapers like the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.\" </p> <p>The statement from the Journal \"could set a cautious tone for the whole earnings season\". </p> <p>Technology advertising volumes at the Journal fell by 26.4% in August, the company said. The largest declines were in communications and software firms. A number of big names in technology have issued cautious earnings forecasts in recent weeks, including Intel and Hewlett-Packard.</p>",
  "<p>Stem cells taken from a developing foetus may one day be used to limit brain damage in premature births or during birth, and also to repair genetic defects in the womb. </p> <p>Huseyin Mehmet, a scientist at the medicine faculty of Imperial College, said that in 1993 the youngest premature baby kept alive at Hammersmith hospital was about 27 weeks' gestation. </p> <p>He told the science festival: \"Now, routinely, technology has moved on to allow us to save babies born at 23 weeks' gestation.\" He added: \"I am not here to discuss the moral and ethical issues, but just to remind you, the legal age for abortion is 24 weeks' gestation.\" </p> <p>Children born normally at 40 weeks could suffer accidents at birth that might interrupt oxygen and blood supply to the brain, and lead to cerebral palsy. </p> <p>Babies born at less than 30 weeks' gestation, international studies had showed, had a greater than 80% chance of some kind of neurological problem, either hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder or severe spasticity. </p> <p>\"For many years, and for too long in this country, we have underestimated the importance of brain damage in babies,\" Dr Mehmet said. </p> <p>Some damage could be linked to a natural piece of developmental \"machinery\" called apoptosis or programmed cell death, triggered by trauma in the womb. Sometimes this damage in newborn or premature babies could be slowed or alleviated by cooling the body. \"Just by reducing body temperature by 3C for about 12 hours we get a substantial improvement in animal models and now, initial studies suggest, in clinical trials,\" he said. </p> <p>But what could be done about those cells that had already been damaged fatally? </p> <p>Dr Mehmet's group at Hammersmith had devised a way of taking blood and even bone marrow from a foetus still in the womb. </p> <p>He said: \"You could treat these stem cells, grow them up and use them for future transplantation in place of the cells that have been lost. We have evidence that these human foetal stem cells - these are not embryonic stem cells - can integrate into the brain.\" </p> <p>Research on mice had found that stem cells could become brain cells. </p> <p>Five or 10 years from now, this approach could be made to work in humans, he said. </p> <p>\"We have taken these cells out of a human, and we have asked the question: can they become brain cells in the lab? The answer is yes. Can we inject them back into an embryo - of course we are not going to do it in a human embryo, this is all done in mice - and then ask, can they integrate into the developing mouse brain? The answer is, yes they can. </p> <p>\"The final question is: can they repair a damaged mouse brain? We haven't got the answer to that yet.\" </p> <p>The technique was highly experimental, he said. Researchers needed to work with cells from an early stage of gestation, which posed risks for the embryo. But scientists elsewhere in the world had successfully taken blood samples to diagnose genetic diseases at an early stage. </p> <p>Dr Mehmet said: \"Taking tissue from the same patient and putting it back in is a much more attractive way of transplantation than what we currently do, with matched donors. The advantage of this approach is that if it could work - and I am not saying it can at the moment - we could take these cells from a patient that we know has a genetic disease. There is nothing to stop us, two months into the pregnancy, taking those cells. Then we have seven months to manipulate those cells in a controlled laboratory environment, correct the genetic defect - haemophilia, thalassaemia, anaemia, any genetic defect where we know the cause - and put those corrected cells back into the patient they originally came from. </p> <p>\"Of course it sounds like science fiction. But science fiction can often become science fact.\"</p>",
  "Women who have been charged with a criminal offence are entitled to be presumed innocent until proven guilty (Call for review of women in jail on remand, September 6). Only in exceptional circumstances should they be committed to prison while on remand. The injudicious use of prison custody for innocent women is inexcusable and contributes to the problem of prison overcrowding. Furthermore, women's prisons are in crisis, unable to offer a safe and decent environment to women entrusted to their care. Last year, a record 14 female inmates died, including my daughter Sarah, 18, apparently from self-inflicted deaths. So far this year, 11 women have died. Some of these women were on remand, as well as being mothers. The chair of the Magistrates' Association has commented that there needs to be an increase in provision and improvement in the quality of court-based diversion schemes for women with mental health problems. Prison deaths leave an ugly stain on the record of Blair's government. <br> <b>Pauline Campbell</b> <br> Malpas, Cheshire <p> We are in touch with more than 400 women prisoners. The chaos caused by even a short period on remand is familiar to us, as we help pick up the pieces: sorting out rent arrears, finding accommodation for those made homeless, helping women maintain contact with their children. A succession of NGOs and government departments have reported on the abuse, addiction, poverty and mental health problems that characterise the lives of women prisoners, most of whom pose no threat to public safety. There is no further excuse for the lack of urgency on this issue.<br> <b>Cathy Stancer</b><br> Women in Prison </p> <p>Helena Kennedy is absolutely right to call for a review of the use of remand. However, with up to three-quarters of women entering prison in immediate need of drug detoxification, it is quite clear that the answer lies in a radical response to the problems associated with drug addiction.

  "The first genetically modified seeds for planting and sale across the European Union, including the UK, were given the go-ahead by the European commission yesterday. <p>Green groups condemned its approval of 17 varieties of maize seed developed by Monsanto, the US biotech group, but welcomed a separate decision to drop plans for setting GM thresholds in conventional seeds. </p> <p>David Byrne, the health and consumer protection commissioner, said the decision to allow the Monsanto maize to be placed in the EU's common seed catalogue was a \"logical step\". </p> <p>He said: \"The maize has been thoroughly assessed to be safe for human health and the environment.

  "<p>Honufa came to Dhaka last year. Severe erosion on her family's patch of land on one of the islands in the mouth of the Ganges forced the young Bangladeshi woman to leave her village for the capital. She took a boat and then an overnight bus and ended up in a shantytown called Bari Badh, which sprawls on the slopes of a new flood embankment. </p> <p>Honufa was lucky to find work immediately. She gets about 40p a day breaking bricks with a hammer. A tenth of what she earns goes on fresh water, the same on transport, but almost a third is needed to pay the rent for the room which she shares with two other women and three young children. </p> <p>It's seven foot square, built of bamboo, rusty corrugated iron and cardboard and squats on stilts over a fetid lagoon. The monsoon-swollen water swirls just a few feet below the floor. A latrine at the end of a walkway empties straight into the water. Last month, the whole community of 5,000 people was flooded out. </p> <p>Bari Badh is not typical of Dhaka's slums, some of which are long established and reasonably secure with electricity and drainage. It appeared three years ago, as soon as the embankment was built and it will probably not exist in three years because businessmen are already filling in the lagoon with rubbish in advance of building more solid homes. </p> <p>When that happens, Honufa and the others will be moved on to new, equally vulnerable slums on a new edge of one of the world's most rapidly growing cities. Dhaka, growing more than 5% a year, will have exploded from fewer than 600,000 people in 1961 to a projected 22 million in 2030. </p> <p>Next week, the UN's world urban forum meets in Barcelona and world leaders and demographers will hear that the number of slum dwellers like Honufa could double within 25 years to more than two billion people, almost one in four of the world's projected population. Two days later, the United Nations population fund will release its annual state of the world report which will show that almost 95% of the expected 2.5 billion increase in global population expected over same period will be in African and Asian cities. By then, more than 80% of north America, Europe, Australia and Latin America, and half of Asia and Africa will probably be living in urban areas. </p> <p>Put the global population and poverty trends together and it's clear that the world is making a major transition at a breathtaking pace. Sometime in the next two years, humanity will cross, probably forever, the line from being a rural species to an urban one. It will mark a turning point, a revolution potentially as significant as the passage from the middle ages to the modern age, which will redefine culture, politics and the way we all live. </p> <p>The scale of the redistribution of people now taking place is vast. Just 100 years ago, only one in seven of the world lived in a town or city and there were 16 places thought to have more than one million people. Today there are more than 400 cities with over one million and in 15 years time, a further 150 are expected to join the club. The global urban population increased 36% in the 1990s alone. </p> <p>Contrary to popular imagination, however, the future is not expected to be a world of mega cities like Dhaka, Cairo, or Manila. According to a new book by a group of demographers working with the Washington-based US National Research Council (NRC), the lion's share of the world population increases over the next 25 years will be in towns and cities with fewer than one million people. They expect these places to account for 60% of the developing country urban population. Cities of from one to five million will house another 26%. </p> <p>The authors suggest that the largest cities, although stretched to the limit in poor countries to provide even minimal services for their inhabitants, will be well-placed to attract international money for housing, infrastructure and services. In 15 years, they expect 60 cities to have more than five million people. </p> <p>Of these, a premier league of about 30 \"world cities\" is developing, all of which are becoming dominant in their regions. The economic globalisation process, says the NRC team, is forcing them to compete more strongly with each other for events such as the Olympics, but also the world's financial markets and business centres. </p> <p>The authors fear, however, that the smaller cities will be increasingly left out and will be under-served by governments who will choose to funnel money into ever more dominant capitals. \"The implications of globalisation for smaller cities are potentially disturbing. If capital is diverted from smaller cities toprepare larger cities for their global debuts, significant costs for many of the developing world's urban dwellers could result,\" the authors say. </p> <p>Massive urbanisation means hundreds of already near-bankrupt cities trying to cope in 20 years with the kind of problems London or New York only managed to address with difficulty in 150 years. The strains are showing in a growing global freshwater and sanitation water crisis, air pollution leading to continent-wide smogs and 48-hour traffic gridlocks, and reports of dwindling food reserves in many countries. </p> <p>According to the UN, hundreds of cities will be in real trouble within a decade. In China, where urbanisation has been extreme in the past 15 years, 400 out of the 670 biggest cities already have serious water deficits. Elsewhere, many cities are depleting underground stocks and finding that saltwater is getting into the aquifers. </p> <p>Competition for supplies is leading to increased conflicts between industry and agriculture, and, while better management could clearly improve supplies in many places, cities are often right up against their financial or physical limits. </p> <p>Dhaka is one of the most extreme. Dr Azhurul Haq, head of the city's water and sewerage authority, speaks for many rapidly growing cities. \"The problem here is already so serious that it is hard to understand. Providing water is a nightmare. We need a minimum of 1.6bn litres of water a day. Our theoretical capacity is 1.35bn litres a day and our actual production is 1.26bn litres, which means that a lot of people cannot have water. Seventy per cent of people have no sewerage system at all and their waste finds its way to the rivers and lagoons; 90% of it is untreated. </p> <p>\"We have 370 wells, but only 60% of them work. We need to replace 600km of water pipe out of the 2,000km we have. Some pipes are made of asbestos cement, which is very dangerous. We also get 97% of our water from deep underground, which is lowering the water table and is not sustainable.\" </p> <p>Dr Haq says it would cost at least $400m to get Dhaka's water supplies and sanitation up to a minimum standard. The prospect of having to provide for the eight million more people expected to flock to the city in the next 20 years is daunting. \"We live from week to week,\" he says. \"It's all we can do\". </p> <p>What scares many governments, planners and policy makers is the very real prospect that the majority of cities in developing countries will become sprawling slums, with people living without piped water or sanitation, with poor standards of housing, and health and nutrition problems on a par with anything found in the most poverty-stricken rural areas today. </p> <p>Last year, the UN commissioned a 300-page report on the growth of slums. The authors found that slum dwellers account for an average 43% of the population of developing countries. In sub-saharan Africa the proportion of urban residents in slums is highest at 71.9%, while Oceania (Australasia and island groups of the South Pacific) had the lowest at 24.1%. South-central Asia accounted for 58%, east Asia 36.4%. </p> <p>They concluded that local authorities were already failing to keep up with the infrastructural problems posed by rapid urbanisation. More surprisingly, they suggested that the greatest underlying reason for the growth of slums was laissez-faire globalisation - the tearing down of trade barriers, the liberalisation and privatisation of national economies, structural adjustment programmes imposed on indebted countries by the IMF, and the lowering of tariffs promoted by the WTO. </p> <p>According to the authors, this \"fundamental\" economic restructuring of the world, which is seeing rich countries move away from manufacturing and poor countries industrialising, drove rapid urbanisation in the 1990s. In South Korea, cities have been flooded with new arrivals since world trade rules allowed cheap, subsidised rice and other food imports to flood into the market. Fishermen in Senegal, Mexico, Ghana and elsewhere had left the countryside because the global fishing fleets have not only denuded catches, but made it impossible for small operators to compete with big foreign fleets. </p> <p>The young of Burkina Faso and Mali had largely left for cities throughout west Africa in hope of work, rather than try to scrape a living off marginal land. It was seldom the process of globalisation alone that made people leave the land, the authors found, but often the expectation of work and fulfilment, fuelled by global TV networks. </p> <p>But the authors found that globalisation wasn't just one of the major causes of urbanisation, it was actually making life worse for the poor in cities. It may have offered unparalleled opportunities for entrepreneurs, but barely any of the benefits of increased trade were reaching the poor. Research in sub-saharan countries found conditions deteriorating throughout the 1990s in many cities. </p> <p>In the past decade - the period of the greatest wealth creation in history, as well as the largest recorded growth in cities - the rich had gained and the poor had lost. Some developing countries, the authors suggested, would have done better to stay out of the globalisation process altogether if they had the interests of their own people in mind. </p> <p>The situation may actually be worse than imagined. According to Diana Mitlin and David Satterthwaite of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in London, the scale and depth of urban poverty is underestimated because of the way poverty is measured in poor countries. They suspect that the poorest half of the urban population may be as malnourished, ill and exploited as the poorest people in rural areas. If this is the case, it demands a different approach from governments and international charities who traditionally focus on rural areas. </p> <p>But is it possible to have cities free from slums? The consensus is yes, but only if countries help to prevent their cities being swamped by congestion, environmental degradation and social unrest. The onus will be on cities themselves, and particularly the self-organising slum dwellers, to find solutions. </p> <p>The solutions, says David Satterthwaite, may not be with global bodies or national governments but with local authorities and urban grassroots groups. He says large-scale self-help community groups are now working together and beginning to take over from traditional developers. </p> <p>\"Poor people are becoming the world's most important builders and planners,\" he says. \"All over the world slum dwellers are organising themselves. In India, the National Slum Dwellers federation, with 750,000 members, is working in 50 cities and has provided cheap, but good homes for more than 35,000 households. In Mumbai they have built toilets that serve 750,000 people. </p> <p>\"A transnational movement of the urban poor and homeless with millions of member households is growing rapidly. The evidence from many nations that community-driven approaches are more effective and far more cost-effective that conventional government programmes.\" </p> <p>\"It's easy to be pessimistic about the problems,\" says Ms Maitlin. \"But the energy of people to improve their environments is enormous. People are investing a lot because it means so much to them. You can see real progress when people have a vision and get together with local government.\" Local government is critically important, she says. </p> <p>Molly Sheehan, of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, says: \"Cities are where most of the world's people will live and where an even greater share of the world's resources will be used in the future - from the vehicles' exhaust that pollutes and warms the atmosphere, to the urban demand for timber that denudes forests.\" </p> <p>She adds, more optimistically: \"But they also hold enormous potential for environmental and social progress. Throughout history, higher levels of health and education come after periods of urbanisation.\" </p> <p><strong>Further reading</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Challenge of Slums, UN-Habitat report, ISBN 1844070379, Earthscan, \u00a325 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cities Transformed, ed Mark Montgomery et al, ISBN 1844070905, \u00a329.95 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Squatter Citizen, ed Jorge E Hardoy and David Satterthwaite, ISBN 1853830208, Earthscan, \u00a319.95 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sustainable Cities, ed David Satterthwaite, ISBN 185383601X, Earthscan, &amp;#;163;16.95 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/issues/m-pop.asp\">UN population resources</a></p>",
  "The Archbishop of Canterbury called last night for campaigners on issues such as social justice, health and the environment to be given formal access to international bodies, including the UN's security council. <p>But, speaking at the first of a series of \"public dialogues\" about world issues, Rowan Williams expressed doubts that such non-governmental organisations would gain the ear of such bodies in the foreseeable future. </p> <p>During the event at St Paul's Cathedral, Dr Williams also discussed the difficulties the US faced in persuading people across the globe that it was not a threatening \"empire\". </p> <p>However, he spoke with more optimism about the potential for religions to work together to put pressure on politicians. </p> <p>Dr Williams shared a platform at the dialogue, which posed the question: \"How should the world be governed?\", with the former foreign secretary Lord Owen and Philip Bobbitt, professor of constitutional law at the University of Texas. </p> <p>Lord Owen suggested structures such as the UN's security council and the World Health Organisation were working quite well and could improve.

  "This week's resignation by Andrew Smith, the works and pensions minister, put Britain's pension crisis in sharp relief for commentators both on and off the business pages. <p>Whoever succeeds Mr Smith, said Alex Brummer in the <b>Daily Mail</b>, \"will be forced to tackle one of the most complex jobs in government and an agenda that will affect the lives not just of today's workforce, but for those for generations to come.\" </p> <p>The crisis will not be rectified by the pensions bill, reckoned the <b>Financial Times</b>. The new bill, which is still being debated in parliament, will create a new regulator and a protection fund for members of company schemes that have collapsed. But the issues tackled in the bill \"are dwarfed by the wider crisis in pension provision, as Britain struggles to finance adequate retirement benefits for elderly people who are now living longer\", it said. \"The much-vaunted occupational pensions schemes face a funding gap of \u00a354bn ... The value of the state pension has been eroded, driving many more means-tested benefits such as pension credits and weakening incentives to save for retirement.\" </p> <p>The halving of share prices and \"Gordon Brown's \u00a35bn tax raid\" had exacerbated the crisis, noted Patience Wheatcroft in the <b>Times</b>. \"Savers in money-purchase schemes [have seen] their future pensions shrink by the week. Members of employee-guaranteed schemes whose companies went bust are worse off. What assets remained were often exhausted by paying pensions, leaving little or nothing to those yet to retire. The post-Maxwell 1995 Pension Act could not cope. And the Pension Protection Fund will be too little too late.\" </p> <p>But the <b>Independent</b>'s Jeremy Warner felt that the fault did not just lie with the Blair government. \"The problem with the pensions timebomb is that by definition, it is a problem for the future, not the here and now,\" he argued. \"This makes governments extraordinarily reluctant to address it in any meaningful way, as any such attempt is almost bound to involve an immediate cost in the form of higher taxes.\" </p> <p>Warner reckoned Labour's failure to address the pen sion crisis earlier could be \"explained only by its obsession with weapons of mass destruction and other imaginings with which to distract us from the really important things ... Belatedly, No 10 has woken up and smelt the coffee.\" </p> <p>Anthony Hilton, in the London <b>Evening Standard</b>, said it was the government that had created \"an environment where it pays\" for people to be \"feckless\" about retirement provision. \"Under Mr Brown's system of credits and means-tested allowances, the state will provide the penniless with far more than a hard-working, responsible normal individual could hope to save by their own devices,\" said Hilton. </p> <p>But judging from the evidence so far, countered Neil Collins in the <b>Daily Telegraph</b>, such reckless people should be wary. \"[Mr Smith has] claimed that 2.5 million pension households were getting an average of \u00a341.80 a week from the pensions credit,\" said Collins. \"This is pure prestidigitation. Research from Age Concern found that more than half the 3 million people claiming the credit are actually getting less than \u00a310 a week, and the average is a pitiful \u00a39.63.\" </p> <p>The <b>Daily Mirror</b>'s Rosa Prince was angry with the private sector. \"Big business is the real villain of the pensions crisis,\" she said. \"For most companies, the answer to the [pension] shortfall has been to scrap final-salary schemes ... Yet most that axed [those] schemes for workers have kept them at boardroom level. Directors' pensions are worth on average \u00a32.15m.\" </p> <p>The Daily Mail's Brummer saw a possible solution in the crisis by making employee pension savings compulsory, as it is in Australia. \"Yet ... mandatory saving in an employer's pension scheme would be seen as another stealth tax, even though it could be essential to keeping future retirement funds solvent,\" said Brummer. \"The brave politician who bites this particular bullet will risk not only their own career but that of the whole of government. This was not a challenge Mr Smith was ready to take on. But there should be no mistaking the direction in which the nation is heading.\"</p>"
