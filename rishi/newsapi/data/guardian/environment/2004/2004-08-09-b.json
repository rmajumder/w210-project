  "<p>Britain's Olympic athletics team, branded the worst for nearly 30 years, have been told they are not as bad as some of the sport's biggest names have suggested. </p> <p>Max Jones, the UK Athletics' performance director, has written to each of the 58 members of the team of 58 in a bid to boost their self-belief. </p> <p>\"We shall have, in Athens, the best prepared British Olympic team in history,\" Jones wrote. \"Lottery funding over the past seven years has enabled UK Athletics to put in place a world-class support structure of which, for example, our medical team is now on par with any in the world. </p> <p>\"We are now in a position to have a successful games if you have confidence in your own ability and are positive about achieving in Athens. Believe in your own talent, in your coach, in your support team and, finally, in yourself as an elite athlete.\" </p> <p>Colin Jackson and Steve Cram are among the former athletes who have criticised the team and Peter Matthews, the respected editor of the ATFS Annual, the sport's Wisden, has predicted Britain's lowest medal haul since 1976 in Montreal when the only medal was Brendan Foster's bronze in the 10,000 metres. </p> <p>Indeed Jones had also helped fuel the pessimistic mood by saying, three months ago, Britain had less medal possibilities than they did in Sydney, where the team won six, including two gold. </p> <p>\"All I did early season was point out that we had less probable medallists this time around - there were plenty of possibles but not too many probables, which was true - and some people took that to mean we weren't going to win anything at whatever,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It seemed that expectations went through the floor and I sent the letter to tell them to prove people wrong and get out there and do it. </p> <p>\"I was portrayed as saying we didn't have a good team and we'd have a poor games, but that was incorrect. The only thing I was saying was that we didn't have as many probable medallists as in Sydney.\" </p> <p>Jones, who is due to retire after the Games, is overseeing the last-minute preparations of the squad at the pre-Olympic training camp in Cyprus, where only three of the team due to compete in Athens are not scheduled to visit. </p> <p>They include Paula Radcliffe, the world-record holder for the marathon who has relocated from her normal training base in Font Romeu in the French Pyrenees to a secret location in southern Spain. </p> <p>\"I have spoken to Paula on the telephone and everything is fine,\" said Jones. \"She said everything is going very well and she has no injuries, so she is very happy at the moment. </p> <p>\"Paula has always done her own thing and we don't have a problem with that. In any case, Cyprus is probably not the best environment for 25-mile runs. </p> <p>\"She wanted to go where she has been before and which is proven, not take any risks. We have confidence in Paula and she has her own support team where she is, and she'll go to Athens on the 18th.\"</p>",
  "The historian Theodore Zeldin once pointed out that conferences on French national identity outnumber the striptease shows in Paris. <p>\"Everybody repeats that France is in crisis, in many different crises,\" he wrote. \"But they seem to forget that this has always been true.\" </p> <p>This summer France's continuing identity crisis has triggered an orgy of introspection and existential contemplation among France's newspaper reading population. </p> <p>To judge by the opinion pages of France's leading rightwing daily, Le Figaro, the nation is in the grips of a powerful, soul-destroying bout of self-doubt. </p> <p>Asked to define and explain the precise nature of what it means to be French, some 40 philosophers, politicians, academics and writers have devoted more than 50,000 words to the issue, in a series which has occupied most of the paper's comment space for the past two months until it concluded yesterday. Many of the responses have been bleak in the extreme. </p> <p>Pointing to France's loss of its position as a global power, its weakening role within Europe, its failure to integrate its immigrant population, its exhausted public services and its stumbling industry, the exercise has been imbued with a nostalgia for a lost era of French greatness. </p> <p>Many of the articles reflect the current wave of \"declinism\" in France, a spreading intellectual phenomenon which has over the past few months inspired a series of highly self-critical but best-selling books about the nation's fundamental problems. With titles such as French Disarray, France in Freefall, French Arrogance, the works indulge in a frenzy of self-flagellation over the country's stale economy, mounting unemployment and its flailing position in the international arena. </p> <p>The books have unsettled the government and prompted irritated responses from the prime minister and the foreign minister. </p> <p>The mood of much of the newspaper series is reflected in an article by the philosophy professor Chantal Delsol, who asks: \"How is it that such a brilliant nation has become such a mediocre power, so out of breath, so indebted, so closed in its own prejudices ... To be French today is to mourn for what we no longer are.\" </p> <p>The theme is continued by the linguist Claude Hag\u00e8ge, a professor at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France, who adds mournfully: \"The decline of the French language is inseparable from the decline of the French nation.\" </p> <p>\"Those French who doubt that they have an identity need only listen to those who hate them to convince themselves that it exists,\" writes Roland Hureaux, citing the constant anti-French vitriol of the British tabloids. </p> <p>While much of Britain's media relaxes into the silly season for the summer months, in France, the reverse is the case. </p> <p>Le Figaro launched its campaign to discover \"Qu'est-ce qu'\u00eatre fran\u00e7ais en 2004\" just during the period when its readers would have the spare time to soak up the long daily philosophical treatises. </p> <p>Jean de Belot, the editorial director at Le Figaro who conceived the project, said this was more than an academic exercise, stressing that finding some kind of answer was vital to the nation's capacity to develop. </p> <p>\"A lot of writers had no problem defining the concept of French identity in the past, but were unable to express what it is now or would be in the future,\" he said. \"It is very important to address this issue because if one can't answer the question of who one is, one can't answer the question of what one should be doing.\" </p> <p>He denied that there was anything inherently French in this thirst for self-definition. </p> <p>\"These are not purely philosophical questions. A lot of the responses were extremely practical - such as how we should be dealing with the issue of integration, Europe and our role on the world stage.\" </p> <p>Summarising the series yesterday, he wrote: \"France in 2004 is a nation in doubt.\" The country which was the driving force behind the project of the European Union was now gravely disappointed with its role in the newly-expanded body. \"For the past 20 years the project of Europe has been described as a unique path towards renewed influence and economic prosperity. But this promise has not been kept,\" he concluded. </p> <p><b> French diplomacy</b><br> </p> <p>Instead of giving France a louder voice internationally, the European body has done the reverse. \"It was only in isolation on the Iraq affair that French diplomacy has made itself heard,\" he wrote, adding that France has also been disappointed in its expectations of the economic benefits promised by the European Union. </p> <p>\"The economy is suffocating. Big industrial groups are investing elsewhere,\" he said. \"The best-off are fleeing, the most talented are leaving. Even the middle classes are demoralised by the taxation levels.\" </p> <p>But not all the articles have been negative. Some (particularly those contributed by serving government ministers) have attempted to boost the nation's self-confidence. </p> <p>And the battle against the declinists was taken up by the writer Denis Tillinac, who concluded: \"The enemy of France is less Brussels or Washington than its propensity towards self-denigration.\" </p> <p>It seems the question of the nature of Frenchness is likely to continue to trouble the country's intellectuals for some time to come.</p>",
  "Four Japanese electricity workers were killed yesterday and seven others injured when turbine steam escaped at a nuclear power plant in Mihama, on the Sea of Japan. <p>The reactor automatically shut down while rescue workers tried to help the victims. </p> <p>The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said there were no radioactive materials in the steam and no radiation impact on the environment. </p> <p>The incident involved the highest number of fatalities at a Japanese nuclear power plant, and it has heightened concern about the nuclear industry. The dead, who have not been identified, were severely burned and suffered heart and lung failure. </p> <p>Officials of Kansai Electric Power, which runs the plant, said its two other reactors were operating normally. </p> <p>They said they had yet to determine the cause of the accident, but the local media quoted a company official as saying that the leak might have been caused by a lack of cooling water in the pipe. </p> <p>The managing director, Hiroshi Matsumura, apologised for the accident at a news conference. </p> <p>\"This is very regrettable, he said. \"I feel sorry for the victims and their families. We are determined to find out what caused the accident and to report our findings as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, promised that the government would \"do our best to investigate the cause, to prevent a repeat and to implement safety measures\". </p> <p>Nobutake Masaki, a Mihama city official, said no radioactive material was involved and that the steam had leaked only inside the building. </p> <p>About 200 people are believed to have been inside the building when the leak occurred. All 11 of those affected were on the second floor of the three-storey building, although it is not clear what work they were doing at the time. </p> <p>Anti-nuclear campaigners said the incident would strengthen opposition to nuclear power. </p> <p>Since an incident at a uranium reprocessing plant at Tokaimura in 1999 which killed two people and exposed 400 to radiation, a number of communities have voted against the construction of nuclear power plants. </p> <p>\"There is already widespread mistrust beneath the surface,\" said Aileen Mioko Smith, director of Green Action. </p> <p>\"But when something like this happens, those feelings will come to the fore.\" </p> <p>She said that the continuing deregulation of the Japanese nuclear power industry would encourage power companies to cut costs when they should be investing more in safety. </p> <p>\"There have been fewer inspections and a reduction in the number of items that are checked. </p> <p>\"If this continues, there are going to be more accidents.\" </p> <p>Japan has more than 50 nuclear power plants, providing 34% of its energy needs, but the industry has been dogged by a series of accidents and attempted cover-ups. </p> <p>Less than six months after the Tokaimura incident there was a fire at the Onagawara nuclear power plant. </p> <p>Two years ago the biggest power company, Tokyo Electric, was forced to close its 17 nuclear power plants temporarily after admitting that it had hidden dozens of cracks over 15 years. </p> <p>In February eight nuclear workers were exposed to low-level radiation when they were accidentally sprayed with contaminated water. </p> <p>The Mihama plant leaked 55 tonnes of radioactive water from its No 2 reactor in 1991.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays have announced a new \u00a357m three-year sponsorship of the Premiership, which will now be called the Barclays Premiership.</p> <p>The banking company has also committed an additional \u00a330m to assist sports at the grass-roots level with building facilities, kits and equipment. </p> <p>The investment scheme - to be labelled 'Spaces for Sport' - is thought to be the biggest single injection of cash into the base-level of sports in the United Kingdom. But it was the continuation of Barclays' association with the Premiership that dominated a glitzy reception in London this afternoon.</p> <p>Football personalities like Gordon Strachan and League Managers Association official Frank Clark were on hand to hear Premiership chief executive Richard Scudamore announce the launch. </p> <p>The fans may not easily discern the difference as Barclaycard have been the Premiership's sponsors over the last three years. But the rebranding with the parent company's name up front is believed to be a device to carry the competition's name to a more global audience. </p> <p> Scudamore believes the Premiership, which kicks off on Saturday, now has the pulling power to take a more hands-on role in the broadcasting of matches abroad, which will generate increased income. </p> <p>A notable absentee at the launch was Premiership chairman Dave Richards, no doubt heavily involved in his other role as Football Association councillor. </p> <p>The Premiership launch took place on the same day the FA started a two-day meeting to sort out their recent problems. A massive restructuring process is on the cards at Soho Square where control of the game will be handed over to professional administrators rather than the county representatives currently in power.</p> <p>But Scudamore, who has been tipped as a possible successor to departed FA chief executive Mark Palios refused to comment on such speculation. </p> <p>He said: \"I'm just looking forward to a great new campaign. Questions about the FA? I won't even go there.\" </p> <p>And the man who has been the league's No1 administrator for six years, said: \"You just feel the season is about to get under way now when we have a situation like this announcing the Premiership's new sponsors. Too soon? Not for me.\"</p> <p>Barclays also announced they will sponsor the Professional Footballers' Association, the League Managers Association and the the Football Writers' Association over the next three years.</p>",
  "Four people were today killed and seven others injured in an accident at a nuclear power facility in Japan. <p>The victims suffered severe burns after steam at a temperature of 200C escaped from machinery. Kansai Electric Power, which runs the plant, said a lack of cooling water had caused the accident, the Kyodon news agency reported. </p> <p>No radioactive material was involved in the leak, and there had been no need to evacuate the area around the factory, which is in the city of Mihama, around 200 miles from Tokyo.</p> <p>\"Radioactive materials weren't contained in the steam that leaked out ... we've received a report that there is no impact from radiation on the surrounding environment,\" an official for the nuclear and industrial safety agency told a news conference. </p> <p>Kansai Electric Power said it had shut the 826,000 kilowatt nuclear power generation unit at the facility, and was unsure when it would resume operation.</p> <p>The accident occurred at around 3.30pm (0630 GMT), shortly after workers had entered a turbine building to take measurements, national broadcaster NHK reported.</p> <p>Local government officials said the cause of the accident was under investigation, but a trade ministry spokesman told reporters that there was no technical problem with the core nuclear reactor at the plant.</p> <p>\"We must do our best to investigate the cause, to prevent a repeat, and to implement safety measures,\" the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said. </p> <p>Japan relies on nuclear power to supply 30% of its electricity, but a succession of safety problems have undermined the public's faith.</p> <p>Today's accident was the worst at a nuclear plant since 1999, when a radiation leak at a fuel reprocessing facility in Tokaimura, north-east of Tokyo, killed two workers and affected hundreds of others. </p> <p>In a separate development today, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Japan's biggest power producer, said it had shut a nuclear power generation unit at its Fukushima-Daini plant because of a water leak.</p>",
  "<p>A nonradioactive steam leak killed four people and injured seven others today in the worst-ever accident at a Japanese nuclear power plant, officials said. Two workers were in critical condition. </p> <p>No radiation was involved and there was no need to evacuate the area around the plant in Mihama, a small city about 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Tokyo, officials said. \"Radioactive materials weren't contained in the steam that leaked out ... We've received a report that there is no impact from radiation on the surrounding environment,\" an official for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency told a news conference. </p> <p>Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi vowed to launch a thorough investigation into the accident, which follows a string of safety problems and attempted cover-ups at Japan's nuclear power plants. </p> <p>Fears about the safety of the country's 52 nuclear power plants surged in 1999 after a radiation leak northeast of Tokyo killed two workers and exposed hundreds to radiation. </p> <p>Three years later, an investigation revealed that Tokyo Electric Power, the world's largest private utility, systematically lied about the appearance of cracks in its reactors during the 1980s and 1990s. </p> <p>Today's leak was caused by a lack of cooling water in the reactor's turbine, said Kimihito Kawabata, a spokesman for plant operator Kansai Electric Power. The steam was believed to be about 270 degrees Celsius (518 Fahrenheit). The company said it was unsure when the reactor would restart. <br>\"We are now investigating the cause,\" a Kansai Electric official told a news conference. </p> <p>After the accident, Kansai Electric officials found a hole on the condenser pipe, public broadcaster NHK reported. It did not elaborate on the size of the hole, believed to be the source of the leak. </p> <p>Four workers died after suffering severe burns, said Takanori Amimoto, at the nearby Fukui prefecture (state) government office. </p> <p>Seven others were injured, two of them critically, a police official said on condition of anonymity. Three of the others were seriously injured, he said. The remaining two suffered minor injuries. </p> <p>The No. 3 nuclear reactor in Mihama, which started operations in 1976, automatically shut down when steam began spewing from the leak, said Takahiro Seno, another Kansai Electric Power official. </p> <p>The Mihama plant's two other reactors were operating normally, officials said. </p> <p>\"There was no leak of radioactivity that could harm the environment,\" said Nobutake Masaki, a Mihama city official. He added that the steam, which was not radioactive, leaked only inside the building. </p> <p>The workers were all employees of Kiuchi Keisoku Co., an Osaka-based subcontractor of Kansai Electric. They were all inside the turbine building to prepare for regular inspections of the plant. </p> <p>Prime Minister Koizumi said \"we must put all our effort into determining the cause of the accident and to ensuring safety.\" He added that the government would respond \"resolutely, after confirming the facts.\" </p> <p>The United States suffered a similar accident at the Surry nuclear power plant in southern Virginia almost two decades ago when a 46-centimeter (18-inch) steel pipe burst and released 114,000 liters (30,000 gallons) of boiling water and steam, killing four. </p> <p>No radioactive materials were released in the 1986 incident. Operators later said the pipe had been eroded by turbulent water. </p> <p>Today's accident in Mihama, which has a population of about 11,500, was the second fatal accident at a Japanese nuclear plant. </p> <p>The first was in 1999, when a radiation leak at a fuel-reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, northeast of Tokyo, killed two workers and caused the evacuation of thousands of local residents. That accident was caused by two workers who tried to save time by mixing excessive amounts of uranium in buckets instead of using special mechanized tanks. </p> <p>Several major power-generation companies have since been hit with alleged safety violations at their reactors, undermining public faith in nuclear energy and leaving Japan's nuclear program in limbo. </p> <p>Tokyo Electric Power, after the investigation revealing a coverup of cracks, temporarily shut down all 17 of its reactors for inspections to reassure the public they were safe. </p> <p>Energy-poor Japan relies on nuclear power to supply 30 percent of its electricity. </p> <p>In February, eight workers were exposed to low-level radiation at another power plant when they were accidentally sprayed with contaminated water. The doses were not considered dangerous.</p>",
  "Three police stations a month have closed since Tony Blair came to power, the Liberal Democrats revealed today. <p>New figures the party has obtained from the Home Office show that 227 stations shut since 1997 in England and Wales, with Essex alone losing 59.</p> <p>The statistics will provide ammunition for a high-profile speech on crime the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, is planning to give tomorrow in Middlesbrough.</p> <p>However, the numbers also show that closures ran at an even higher rate when Mr Howard was home secretary in the early 1990s: stations were shutting at the rate of one a week when the Tory leader presided over the Home Office during the four years to May 1997.</p> <p>In all, 536 stations have been lost since 1992 as officers and resources have been concentrated in larger stations, often in town centres, according to the previously secret official study. Since 1997, Essex has been hardest hit, with 59 closures, followed by Gloucestershire, with 23, and south Wales, with 22. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, who made the figures public, said the government was letting people down. </p> <p>\"Many of these closures have been in the name of efficiency and cost cutting,\" he said. \"Thousands of people no longer have a permanent police presence in their town or neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"Community policing is vital for cutting crime and maintaining public confidence. At a time when the government claims the public should have a bigger say in local policing, people are increasingly unable to go down to the station and talk to an officer in person. </p> <p>\"Police stations are a precious resource and the government has let people down by failing to protect them.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"People want to see police out on the street and they also want to know there is a local police station they can go to.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office responded: \"Police station numbers have reduced in the past 10 years to take out inadequate and little utilised premises in favour of modern facilities. These are located in areas of greatest policing pressure.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard's speech tomorrow is timed to try to wrestle the initiative on crime back from the government, which announced extra billions of pounds for law and order and more than 20,000 more community support officers in last month's spending review. </p> <p>The Tory leader is expected to blame Britain's crime rate in part on a lack of personal responsibility and an absence of father figures. </p> <p>He is due to say: \"Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions; it is someone else's or something else's fault: the environment, the government, society.</p> <p>\"Children, especially boys, benefit hugely from a male influence. Of course, this isn't always possible because a large number of men simply abandon their responsibilities as fathers.</p> <p>\"But there are many fathers in Britain today who do want to play their part yet can't get access to their children.\"</p> <p>The Tories have already pledged to change the law so there is a legal presumption that both parents have an equal right to be involved in their children's upbringing.</p>",
  "Amanda Hopkinson writes: I was first invited to visit Henri Cartier-Bresson (obituary, August 5 2004), or Henri as he immediately asked to be called, in the late 1980s. Having been given a slot in the British Journal Of Photography for \"photography interviews\", I wrote to all those I was most interested in and, to my surprise, they all wrote back. Henri was the only one to decline, explaining that he no longer gave interviews \"as a photographer\", since he had given it up to return to painting. <p>It was the one time in my life I sought the professional advice of my father, Tom Hopkinson, the former editor of Picture Post, and used his name. A clumsily typed - but beautifully composed - note came back. It started: \"Puisque vous \u00eates la fille de Sir Tom ... \" (\"Since you are the daughter of Sir Tom ... \") and instructed me when and where to find him. As I entered his magnificent rue de Rivoli apartment, Henri greeted me with a table spread with contact sheets. </p> <p>Incredibly, they had a number of different images within each sequence highlighted for reproduction. Impishly gleeful at my perplexity, he informed me: \"So now you see? Le moment decisif is a matter not only of capturing the content of an image, but of placing it in context.\" It was the proof that there could, in fact, not only be a compositionally perfect moment in time, but also a precisely appropriate image to tell a particular story. </p> <p>Beyond the entrance lobby with its table of artfully casually arranged prints, there was the sitting-room with its panorama over the Tuileries gardens. As I paused before a Max Ernst, one of a gallery of surrealist paintings and modernist sculptures, Henri waved an arm around the room by way of airy introduction. \"These are among my friends,\" he said. \"Every one is given to me by a friend. I do not buy to collect.\" </p> <p>Art, then, was what fundamentally weighed with this artist who had dedicated so much of his professional and personal life to photography, but who no longer wished to reiterate the significance of the medium to our way of seeing the 20th century, still less to comment upon his own importance in formulating it. </p> <p>Having thanked me for not bringing any recording equipment into this curiously technology-free environment, he informed me this would be a conversation and not an interview. On that basis, we were free to discuss his life, his work and, particularly, art and humanity. </p> <p>Hours later, the final surprise was to be told: you may use whatever you wish from what has been said here today. Caught off guard, I babbled about him not wishing to see his words reproduced in a photographic magazine. \"You may use whatever you choose,\" he repeated, \"only please - not in quotation marks.\" Just before I raced downstairs to find a bench in the Tuileries where I scribbled down every memorable minute of our first encounter, he beckoned me over to the window. </p> <p>\"Here, I want to give you this,\" he said. It was a book of his photographs of Paris. In it was one of that same panorama, the distance receding into mist. Referring to a discussion we had had on whether the camera lies or not, he decided to improve on its accuracy. \"You see what's missing?\" he asked, then rapidly sketched in the missing Eiffel Tower. Art was, after all, once more triumphant.</p>",

  "<p>Siestas, going home in hot weather, longer holidays - and working in the cooler north of Britain - are the only way office workers will survive roasting summers later this century, the government has been told. </p> <p>Global warming will make peak temperatures in the average naturally ventilated British office hotter than they are at present in Cairo, according to research for the Department of Trade and Industry. </p> <p>In these offices the thermometer will rise from a current peak of 31C (87F) to nearly 39C by 2080. In the intervening years it will go up to 35C by 2020 and 38C by 2050. </p> <p>Going home won't help much if you live in a modern, lightly built executive house with timber framing, says the study by the international design and engineering consultancy Arup. There the temperature will also rise to 39C in the 2080s. In the 2020s it will be nearly 36C. In the 2050s it will be 37.5C. </p> <p>A report of the study in the current issue of the trade magazine Building says the superficially obvious answer is more air conditioning. But this generates greenhouse gases, was limited by building regulations in 2002, and is likely to be further restricted in future. </p> <p>The magazine quotes Gavin Davies, associate director of Arup Research and Development, as saying: \"The existing building stock has not been developed for future climate change. If you are looking at buildings designed for the long term, then lightweight construction is going to be very susceptible to climate change. </p> <p>\"When the temperature inside a building hits 28C, you cannot just open a window because it is hotter outside than inside. We need Mediterranean shutters, heavy walls, smaller windows and verandas to keep cool.\" </p> <p>Building says the report's finding in favour of buildings with high levels of thermal mass calls into question the government's commitment to timber frame, modular and other lightweight construction systems. </p> <p>The consultants' report is said to recommend: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> blinds and shading to reduce solar gain </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> minimising ventilation when the temperature outside is higher than inside </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> switching off all lights and electrical equipment when not required </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the use of photovoltaics or renewable energy to minimise emissions caused by cooling </p> <p>On the human side, the research proposes: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> relaxing dress codes </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> sending staff home during hot spells </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> introducing flexible working or longer summer holidays </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> siestas </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> relocating offices to the north </p> <p>Arup's project leader for the research, Jake Hacker, told the magazine: \"Statutory requirements and building regulations do not require that designers plan for climate changes. But the results of our study might change this when the codes are reviewed.\" </p> <p>Mr Davies said they chose 28C - \"the point at which people start to feel hot and look for some level of cooling relief\" - as the maximum acceptable internal temperature. </p>",
  "<p>Expectations of another rise in interest rates next month increased today as the price of goods leaving UK factories rose at their fastest rate for eight years in July.</p> <p>Core output prices, which strip out volatile elements such as oil and food, increased by 1.6% in the year to July against 1.3% in June, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. </p> <p>This month-on-month rise of 0.3% is the sharpest increase since September 1995. The increases reflect rises in the prices of secondary raw materials such as scrap steel. </p> <p>The unexpected jump in underlying factory-gate prices prompted analysts to reaffirm their predictions of another rise in interest rates next month, following this month's quarter-point rise, which took borrowing costs to 4.75%.</p> <p>\"The sharpest month-on-month rise in core output prices for nearly nine years in July will be of particular concern to the Bank of England,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight. </p> <p>\"The data reinforce our belief that a further 25 basis point interest rate hike in September is still very possible, although developments over the next month in the housing market and in consumer spending and borrowing will be the key determinants as to whether there is another move as soon as next month.\"</p> <p>John Butler, of HSBC, said today's figures supported the more hawkish elements of the statement published by the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) alongside its rate rise last week and contradicted the more dovish part. </p> <p>\"The pick-up in underlying producer price data may simply feed the MPC's inflation concerns, while the latest house price evidence once again contradicts the Bank's assertion that the housing market is now slowing,\" Mr Butler said. </p> <p>Mr Butler said the Halifax, Nationwide, the Land Registry and the office of the deputy prime minister, have all recorded an acceleration in house price inflation over the past few months, despite statements from the Bank of England that it thinks the property market is off the boil.</p>",

  "<p>For pale, weather-weary Britons, Australia has long held the image of a nation of fit and healthy bronzed surfer dudes, who, when they're not waxing their boards or winning at the Olympics are bounding across the beach after a 'soccer' ball, displaying a jovial \"no worries\" sportsman-like attitude when it gets lost in the surf. </p> <p>For those interested in a career in sports or sports management it's hardly any wonder then that Australian universities hold an appeal - and now the Australian government is giving international students an extra incentive.</p> <p>In July it announced that it will be providing AU$7.8m (about \u00a33m) for the establishment of an International Centre of Excellence in Sports Science and Management (ICESSM) at the former site of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. It is being set up specifically \"to facilitate the international exchange of students and sports management and science professionals\". </p> <p>The centre will be a partnership between the University of Sydney, the University of Technology Sydney, and the Sydney Olympic Park Authority. Part of its remit will be to offer undergraduate and postgraduate studies through the institutions involved. </p> <p>\"Higher education is a very important aspect of our competitiveness as a nation at sport,\" says Brian Newman, CEO of the Sydney Olympic Park authority board. </p> <p>\"Excellence in sports administration as well as quality of thinking behind sports management are some of the elements which make us a successful nation rather than the achievements of sportsmen and women alone. The idea of studying these disciplines at the former site of the Olympics is a particularly attractive option for any student.\"</p> <p>It was the success of the 2000 Olympic Games, held in Sydney, which really established the country's reputation in both sporting excellence and sports management on a global scale. The Australian team was the country's largest ever, with 632 athletes. It took 58 medals, 16 of which were gold - its highest tally in Olympic history. But just as crucially, the facilities at, and management behind, the games were recognised globally as being as successful as the competitors. </p> <p>But despite the image the Australians have of being naturally gifted as sportsmen, success in sport hasn't always been the case and it certainly wasn't a subject high up on the education agenda until recent years. </p> <p>Back in the early 1980s university departments of physical education existed only to train students to become teachers. It was when, in 1976, the Australians suffered disastrous results at the Montreal Olympics by not managing to come home with a single gold medal, that the Australian government realised it needed to look at ways of dramatically improving the sporting industry. </p> <p>The government initiative initially led to the founding of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), generally considered to be the elite powerhouse behind sports training in Australia, in 1981. The AIS offers state of the art facilities to 700 athletes on scholarships each year in 35 separate programs covering 26 sports. Of the 2000 Olympic Games medallists, more than half were current or former athletes from the AIS, and they won 32 of the 58 medals. </p> <p>\"There was a push by the government at that time to increase the number of professional people in sport,\" says Robert McMurtrie, chairman of the Institute of Sports Management. \"People started questioning where all these professionals would come from and universities responded by offering courses to sports administrators. Now this is a very established and recognised industry.\"</p> <p>There are now 45 sports related degrees offered from across the country's 40 universities, and further qualifications offered by dozens of further education and private colleges. The academic discipline of human movement, as it is now known, includes sport science, exercise science, sports coaching, sport and leisure management and health promotion.</p> <p>The successful move towards increased professionalism and investment in the industry is evident in the figures. Last year, Australia's sports and physical recreation services generated AU$4.8bn (\u00a31.8bn) worth of income, while a survey of more than 800 sports management professionals by recruitment agency Sportspeople found 71% held a bachelors degree or higher qualification. </p> <p>\"Sports in higher education has been growing in relevance because now it's very rare for us not to select someone with a degree. It has become a highly competitive industry,\" says Mr McMurtrie.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Funded by:</strong> Bill Kenwright and Paul Gregg are the major stakeholders in True Blue Holdings.

Kenwright has not missed a competitive game in over 40 years, Gregg hasn't been to one in 18 months. </p> <p><strong>Also in the directors' box:</strong> Jon Woods, an Evertonian and a long-standing ally of Kenwright who is currently being counselled, but not bankrolled, by Phillip Green, the failed raider for Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p><strong>Stick a fiver on:</strong> Goodison being plunged into crisis after allegations that Wayne Rooney is a shaved bear. David Moyes denies the rumours but the player is unavailable for comment as he is hibernating. </p> <p><strong>Lesson of last season:</strong> Don't allow your best player to play for his country. Ever. Rooney's superb England performances and the subsequent ballyhoo over whether he would move meant Moyes could not get involved in the transfer market until it was too late. </p> <p><strong>The table they do top:</strong> Everton have spent more seasons in the top flight, played more, lost more and drawn more matches, as well as scored and conceded more goals than any other team in history. </p> <p><strong>You know you're at the ground when:</strong> The Tannoy pipes up with All Together Now, It's A Grand Old Team and follows up with Z Cars as the teams run out. </p> <p><strong>The players</strong></p> <p><strong>Postcard from Portugal:</strong> Rooney's impact at Euro 2004 was such that the club could not function afterwards, the chief executive Trevor Birch leaving six weeks into a five-year plan as the board split over which way to go next.</p> <p><strong>Young player whose time has come:</strong> Leon Osman, 23, had a successful loan spell at Derby and on his return scored five minutes into his full debut at Wolves. Should push for a place in the Premiership's worst midfield. </p> <p><strong>Grudge match:</strong> Luis Boa Morte may have been cleared of making offensive gestures at Everton fans last season but they are unlikely to have forgotten the case or his habits of diving, niggling and playing rather well against them. </p> <p><strong>Trivial pursuits:</strong> Kevin Campbell's house is stacked out with CDs and records and he apparently ploughed around \u00a310m into his own rap label, 2 Wikid. </p> <p><strong>Sky's title sequence to include:</strong> Thomas Gravesen waving his fist at the crowd after failing to get to the byline but winning a throw-in.</p> <p><strong>The manager:</strong> David Moyes</p> <p><strong>Interview style:</strong> Taciturn, dour and honest to the point that sometimes it hurts. Not beyond him to bag the referee with a parting shot, Jeff Winter's \"roll-on tan\" already being the stuff of legend. </p> <p><strong>Grudge match:</strong> Francis Jeffers was handed a one-year loan deal on \u00a325k a week and rewarded Moyes with two FA Cup goals, none in the league and a walkout after not being picked to face Spurs (though Arsenal refused to have him back until the close season). </p> <p><strong>What he could have bought:</strong> \u00a31.25m would have bought a minor stake in 2 Wikid.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 17th.</p> <p><strong>Tactics</strong></p> <p>David Moyes is an advocate of 4-4-2 (effectively 4-5-3 with SuperRooney charging back and forth), though he played 4-3-3 on occasion, which usually proved costly.

  "<p><strong>Funded by:</strong> Cranberries, preserved lemons and guides to boiling eggs. As we all know, the club is solvent thanks to Delia Smith, TV chef and Mrs Norwich City.

Bryan Gunn is the club's commercial manager which, if you imagine David Seaman marketing Arsenal, is a bit weird. </p> <p><strong>Stick a fiver on:</strong> Thomas Helveg's claims that he is not treating Carrow Road as a stepping stone to retirement being undermined when the 33-year-old reveals he has become addicted to Watercolour Challenge with Hannah Gordon. </p> <p><strong>Lesson of last season:</strong> Money talks. A sponsorship deal with Malaysian car manufacturers Proton prompted a tour of the country. The company's chief executive, royal prince Tengku Mahaleel, welcomed the visiting Canaries as \"Team Proton\". Which was nice of him. </p> <p><strong>The table they do top:</strong> Most home internationals (excluding England). With three Scotland stars and two from Northern Ireland, nearly half the first team are unlikely to make it to the World Cup. </p> <p><strong>You know you're at the ground when:</strong> The City boys in the Barclay Stand start mocking the more genteel River End.

The creaking Dane had a good tournament at full-back, playing every game and even having a shot at one point. </p> <p><strong>Young player whose time has come:</strong> There's David Bentley, but he's really Arsenal's. Local boy Ian Henderson may be another to watch; the 19-year-old can play up front, but looks impressive bursting from midfield. </p> <p><strong>Grudge match:</strong> Many Norwich players have been sold off in their time, including Darren Huckerby, who may fancy haunting former manager Kevin Keegan. </p> <p><strong>Trivial pursuits:</strong> The number of players without a snooker table isn't really worth mentioning. Midfielder Phil Mulryne describes his hobbies as playing snooker and watching it on the telly. </p> <p><strong>Sky's title sequence to include:</strong> Huckerby, head down, running into a crowd of defenders.

He's truculent and demands more money than Delia could make from a cookbook, but he was on a free and had to be better than Heckingbottom. </p> <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> 18th.</p> <p><strong>Tactics</strong></p> <p>Last season Nigel Worthington adapted his 4-4-2 formation to incorporate three strikers. This would see Darren Huckerby drifting out to the left, perhaps a tactic too bold for the Premiership.

  "<p>Indiagames has secured a deal with Universal Studios to create mobile games based around, 'The Legacy of Bruce Lee'. In the <a href=\"http://mobenta.com/news/shownews-1827\">press release</a>, a deeply lyrical Jeremy Laws, vice-president of Media Licensing and Strategy at Universal Studios Consumer Products Group, commented:</p> <blockquote> \"Bruce Lee is a truly global brand. His powerful visual image and spiritual philosophies combined with the feelings of excitement and heroism he invokes, have transformed him into a cultural icon, resonating with fans of all ages throughout the globe.\" </blockquote> <br> <p>Which, you have to admit is more imaginative than the usual, \"we're excited about the opportunity to make money out of this.\"</p> <p>We especially enjoyed the mention of Lee as a 'global brand' - just a few lines before appreciating the star's 'Spiritual philosophies'. The juxtaposition may seem stunningly inappropriate, but then Lee did theorise that a good fighter must keep his mind in a perpetual state of emptiness, surely something the average brand manager is familiar with.</p> <p>Anyway, this whole post was just an excuse to reminisce over the classic 1984 platformer, Bruce Lee, developed by Datasoft for the Apple II, Speccy and C64. Remember it? You had to guide Bruce through a wizard's fortress, constantly pursued by a ninja and some kind of rotund sumo character named Yamo. You could kick and punch them both, making this an early variant on the beat-'em-up genre.</p> <p>Best of all, a second player could take control of Yamo, ostensibly to make things harder for the chap playing Bruce. But how many of us simply ganged up on that tiny ninja, kicking our computer-controlled victim around the screen for hours, his tiny brain unable to comprehend Yamo's sudden switch in allegiance?</p> <p>Or was that just me?</p> <p>There are some screenshots <a href=\"http://tacgr.emuunlim.com/downloads/filedetail.php?recid=146\">here</a>.</p> <p>So I've covered Jet Set Willy <em>and</em> Bruce Lee in the space of a week.

  "<p>You'd call him the grandfather of stand-up comedy, if grandfather didn't seem altogether too cosy. He's Richard Pryor: writer, entertainer, film star and the man whose incendiary comic interventions into 1970s America moulded stand-up into the artform we know today. Before Pryor, stand-up in the US was Bob Hope and Bob Newhart: mild one-liners delivered by cheerful men in shirts and ties. Pryor, by stark contrast, was scabrous and confessional, sexy, vernacular, and totally unpredictable. </p> <p>Born in 1940, his background is itself the stuff of jet-black comedy. The son of a prostitute and a pimp, he grew up in his grandmother's brothel in poverty-stricken Peoria, Illinois. As a youth, he worked as a shoe-shine, meat-packer, truck-driver and billiard-hall attendant. In 1963, he moved to New York, to practise stand-up in the Bill Cosby vein, and was soon a regular on US TV variety shows. But his legend really began some years later when, frustrated at having to suppress his own identity in the name of light entertainment, he quit New York for counter-cultural California. </p> <p>When Pryor re-emerged in the early 1970s, it was with a brand of stand-up that no one had seen before. Angry, impassioned, truthful and personal, Pryor spoke about his world: a world of winos, bums and junkies; of black-white inequality; of sex, politics and sexual politics. And then there was the delivery - Pryor delivered comedy like a musician delivers jazz. But it wasn't just stand-up that he radicalised: many credit Pryor with blazing a trail for black people in American life. According to the musician Quincy Jones, he was \"a pioneer ... who made us understand the truth about ourselves\".</p> <p>If this coruscating stand-up is Pryor's major legacy, he'll also be remembered for a middling career in Hollywood film (credits include co-scripting Mel Brooks's Blazing Saddles and starring in Superman III). His life took a grim turn in the early 1980s, when he set himself on fire while free-basing cocaine, and suffered third-degree burns to over 50% of his body. In 1986, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He continued working as a comedian into the following decade, but the disease currently prevents him performing. </p> <p>This year at Edinburgh, Pryor will be judging video submissions for the inaugural Richard Pryor award, to be given to the outstanding ethnic minority comedy act on the Fringe. Edinburgh is notoriously under-attended by black stand-ups, a fact that the award seeks to help redress. </p> <p><strong> Ross Noble:</strong> Having heavily emulated Bill Cosby before finding your own voice, how does it feel seeing your influence on subsequent generations?</p> <p><strong> Richard Pryor:</strong> I hope the younger comics will find their own voice. It's the hardest thing to do. It can hide, but keep looking for it. </p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Having said that you regret using the word \"nigger\" on and off stage, how do you feel about its use by younger comics today? </p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> I did and do use it at times. The way most comics use it is for shock and all it does is disappoint. The only comic I hear use it to fit a routine is [US comic] Dave Chappelle. He can do it. </p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> After you set yourself on fire, did the physical change affect your performance or the way audiences responded to you?</p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> The fire didn't change a thing - except the way I looked in the mirror. I kept my shit on when I was on stage - people seemed to love me more.</p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> You had monkeys and a miniature horse. Have you got any fun animals now? </p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> My dogs, Homer and Spirit, are fun. They make me laugh. </p> <p><strong>Richard Herring:</strong> Where do you get your crazy ideas from? </p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> My ideas came from my life. </p> <p> <strong> Jimmy Carr: </strong> I know you don't perform any more for obvious reasons but do you still write material? If the answer is yes, can I have it? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I think about it but don't really write any more. Except to answer all these questions! </p> <p> <strong> Sarah Kendall: </strong> Of all of your recorded performances which one do you feel was your personal best and why? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I love Live in Concert and some of the NBC Shows - 'cause they were raw and make me laugh now. </p> <p> <strong> SK: </strong> Have you ever gone through phases when you have hated doing stand-up? If so, what made you enjoy it again? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> After the fire, it was hard to get on stage again. But I just kept doing it and the joy and fun came back. </p> <p> <strong> Lenny Henry: </strong> Are there any taboos left in comedy? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Taboos? Not really, but doing comedy well is hard. </p> <p> <strong> LH: </strong> Did Paul Mooney write the Just Us joke on Is It Something I Said? Or was he a constant collaborator? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Paul takes too much fucking credit for my shit, let him take credit for his own. Just Us, we wrote for [the 1970s US sitcom] Sandford and Son. He was one of the writers on my NBC Shows and a writer on [Pryor's autobiographical movie] Jo-Jo Dancer. But Paul needs to take credit for HIS stuff and leave my shit the fuck alone! </p> <p> <strong> Addy Borgh: </strong> Which of your demons have you found hardest to deal with - and talk about on stage? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Which demon? Shit, I dunno his name. The one who fucked me the most. Drugs, women, whoever was winning at the moment. </p> <p> <strong> AB: </strong> How much did the women you knew shape or inform your comedy other than in the material? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Women have always inspired my comedy but [my current wife] Jenny actually helped me more than anybody. And thank God for her now. </p> <p> <strong> AB: </strong> Which was the best drug you ever did: sex, coke or comedy? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Damn, comedy without a doubt. Sex a close second </p> <p> <strong> Lee Mack: </strong> Why did The Richard Pryor Show only last for four episodes in the 1970s? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Four was plenty. The studio started fucking with me too much. It stopped being fun. And I knew it wouldn't be good any more. </p> <p> <strong> Chris Addison: </strong> You're seen as an icon of comedy by everyone who came after you. Do you feel like your stand-up was ground-breaking, and did it feel like it at the time? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I just did my work and let it speak for itself. I never stopped to judge how ground-breaking it would be. I was too busy trying to get it right. </p> <p> <strong> Reginald D Hunter: </strong> How do you feel about the Richard Pryor award at this year's Edinburgh festival? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Jenny and I are really excited, 'cause the Fringe has got to mix it up a bit. I mean, you are all too white over there!!! I like that this is opening things up a bit. That's what I do. </p> <p> <strong> RDH: </strong> You once said that it takes a comic 15 years to find his voice. Do you still believe that? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I think it takes a long fuckin' time to find your voice, hopefully not longer than 15! </p> <p> <strong> RDH: </strong> You once described how you could sometimes feel yourself pulling out of jokes, pulling away from areas that are more dangerous or unknown. You panic sometimes because you want to get to the laugh. What is it that you have to overcome - is it fear? Did you ever beat that - and if so, how? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> The toughest thing is to wait for that laugh and handle those silences, handle the fear - ride out that silence and don't panic. Have faith. It's like that giant wave those surfers wait for. When it comes, it's heaven. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Wiltfong: </strong> It's not unusual after one of your jokes for me to mumble the phrase \"That's so true ...\" after I get done laughing. When you write jokes, are you consciously looking for truthful things to write about or are you just looking to make people laugh - whether it's truthful or not? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Truthful, always truthful. And funny will come. </p> <p> <strong> BW: </strong> When you were coming up, your stand-up was considered cutting edge. Where do you think the cutting edge of comedy is going these days? Do you like or dislike where it's going? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Only a few comics are being really honest and daring, and not just going for the okee-doke. I love Chris Rock, and Chappelle. Colin Quinn is dangerous. There are some I see that will grow or not. I don't know all their names. </p> <p> <strong> Jeff Green: </strong> Richard Pryor Live in Concert (1979) was shown late night on Channel 4 in 1983 and was my inspiration for wanting to be a stand-up comic. In my humble opinion it is the greatest stand-up concert of all time - how long did it take you to get the show together and how did it feel on the night? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> It took about six to eight months, including many nights at the Comedy Store and on the road. I was nervous but really excited when we shot it. I was glad when it was over, and let down. </p> <p> <strong> Al Murray: </strong> What do you think of critics? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I never met anybody who said when they were a kid, \"I wanna grow up and be a critic.\" </p> <p> <strong> Jason Byrne: </strong> You talk about Muhammad Ali in your latest DVD and how frightening it was to be in the ring with him.

  "<p>A growing number of young Americans are being attracted by products that carry political messages. It has helped US clothes company American Apparel come from nowhere just a few months ago to be this summer's must-wear brand. The cotton T-shirt and underwear manufacturer claims to be environmentally friendly and against cheap labour, and it actively promotes its \"ground-breaking political mission\" throughout its advertising. It's one of a new wave of youth brands starting to use politics to sell their wares and, according to new research out this week, more advertisers eager to attract younger consumers should be doing the same. </p> <p>Cause-related marketing, of course, is nothing new: The Body Shop has been successfully selling itself on its ethical stance since the 70s. What's different now, though, is that while issues such as animal testing or women's wellbeing relate directly to Body Shop's business and products, causes now being adopted by brands don't demonstrate any immediate link. Political activism, it seems, is starting to be used as the next youth marketing tool. </p> <p>Take Polo Ralph Lauren, which is running a global campaign to encourage young people to volunteer their time and energy to support local good causes. It has even introduced GIVE jeans, donating a proportion of all revenue to volunteering charities. </p> <p>The fashion brands Phat Farm and Drunknmunky are other examples. The first, launched by the so-called godfather of hip-hop Russell Simmons, founder of Def Jam Records, is a brand dedicated to campaigning for economic justice for black people. Drunknmunky promotes itself as leader of a crusade against the homogeneity of mass manufacturing; its advertising regularly features sub-culture anti-heroes, such as porn stars, as it attempts to get consumers to buy into its nonconformist values. </p> <p>The trendy London fashion store Griffin, meanwhile, has worked with graffiti artist Banksy to hone its subversive credentials as part of its own anti-war campaign. He designed a logo for a T-shirt. </p> <p>For some it's about boosting their brand's appeal by making them seem less establishment, more subversive. Some have even experimented with distributing stencils featuring cut-outs of their logos via websites, shops or magazines. These can then be used by more enthusiastic consumers to place images of the brand in unexpected places, including public spaces - a tactic established by activist groups, although one for which brand owners could now be prosecuted in the UK if they attempt to directly \"place\" the images beyond official advertising hoardings. </p> <p>More mainstream brands are also getting in on the act, although in subtler ways. Sony, Diesel and Puma have started to appropriate some of the communication tactics of political activists by taking their advertising out on to the streets, by emulating the look of flyposting in their legitimate ads, and by using typography or imagery inspired by graffiti. </p> <p>Mates, the condom brand, recently ran a campaign around the theme of sexual encounters in public places, and distributed stickers for consumers to leave a physical mark in locations where they had \"been\". Another campaign, for the music downloading site Napster involved the company producing posters resembling flyposters for everyday products such as pet foods; it then sabotaged these ads by defacing them with its own logo. </p> <p>Political advertising is no longer just about selling party politics, then. And, according to London-based trends analysts Headlight Vision, part of global marketing communications group WPP, it's here to stay. In fact, suggests the latest edition of D_Code - the company's ongoing study tracking the attitudes and concerns of young consumers around the world - \"brand activism\" is set to grow significantly. </p> <p>The reason is simple, says Headlight Vision associate director Sandra Griffin. Many of today's 18-to-25 year-olds feel disenfranchised by established systems, especially politics, and yearn to be part of \"something bigger\". And brands can bridge the gap. </p> <p>\"The harsh reality of a world in turmoil has forced them to re-evaluate their priorities,\" she explains. \"It has also raised their awareness of the problems they will face in the future, and the importance of establishing strong, meaningful connections with other people. There is a clear desire to be part of something - whether that means joining an anti-establishment movement, or simply finding new forms of self-expression to stand out from the crowd and leave a mark.\" Brand owners able to tap into all this, Griffin adds, can only stand to gain. </p> <p>Life's certainly tough for advertisers today. For a start, more and more big brand owners are admitting that traditional advertising no longer works. Roisin Donnelly, the UK marketing director of Britain's largest advertiser, Procter &amp; Gamble, said last week that young people just don't believe in TV advertising any more, and advocated instead less traditional forms of marketing - such as ambient, or street advertising - to get young people talking about P&amp;G products. The pressure is on, then, to find new ways for brands to stand out and have relevance in younger consumers' daily lives. But is political activism in advertising really the answer? </p> <p>\"It's playing with fire,\" believes Andrew McGuinness, chief executive of the advertising agency TBWA London, whose clients include FCUK. \"Unless every aspect of your business is true to a particular cause it could backfire, given how much information about how a company works, treats its employees or sources its raw materials that consumers have access to nowadays. You'd also need to beware of the polarisation of opinion - and consumers - you might engender by using emotive issues, like abortion.\" </p> <p>Benetton, for one, suffered the full force of consumer backlash after using a series of often shocking images - including one of a dying Aids sufferer - in advertising campaigns that ran throughout the 90s. </p> <p>\"The clear danger is that people don't buy it aesthetically, or ideologically. Or that you end up looking like a vicar at a disco. Causes backfire: just ask Piers Morgan,\" says Jason Brownlee, head of Emap Insight which conducts consumer research for the magazine publisher, including the ongoing ROAR youth survey. </p> <p>\"Today's young consumers don't want to consume things that will do people harm. But whether they want to actively buy things that do good, I'm not sure,\" he adds. \"It might work, however, if done locally - like when Nike tried to regain lost ground working with underprivileged American kids, providing them with sports equipment. Actual experience of a brand's values is what really counts: that's what makes any stance or cause real and credible.\" </p> <p>Political activism is serving some brands extremely well, however. \"Being politically engaged is very trendy right now,\" says Marian Salzman, a US futurologist and executive vice president and chief strategy officer of ad agency Euro RSCG Worldwide. She cites current campaigns featuring P Diddy and Ben Affleck designed to woo young American voters to participate in the forthcoming US elections. \"American Apparel has undoubtedly benefited in this environment, and its mission and politics is helping it become popular as an un-corporate Gap.\" </p> <p>Sandra Griffin says that not every advertiser can get away with getting political. But, she adds, imbuing brands with more political meaning will work for some. This doesn't just have to be about linking a brand with a cause or campaign, either. Youth brands also have a role to play in connecting young people with other young people, and providing them with a platform for self-expression - something established structures, including the mainstream media, often fail to do. </p> <p>\"As brands take on aspects of activism they can become aspirational and, ultimately, fashionable,\" Griffin says. \"The challenge then, of course, is how not to then end up looking insincere. But get it right and you could create a lot of positive energy around a brand. And there's no reason why high street brands - not just niche, street fashion names - could capitalise on that.\"</p>",
  "A global immunisation campaign to save the lives of two to three million children a year in the developing world will be launched next year by a $4bn (\u00a32.2bn) a year vaccination project backed by Britain, France and Bill Gates, the multibillionaire founder of Microsoft. <p>Government-backed bonds will be floated on financial markets to fund the programme, designed to tackle easily preventable diseases. </p> <p>Treasury sources said the proposal was at an advanced stage and would be unveiled in the first half of next year, when Britain intends to make Africa the focal point of its presidency of the G8 industrial countries. </p> <p>Britain was approached by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) - an umbrella body covering governments, NGOs and private sector organisations - to see if it would back a plan to frontload extra cash into health programmes. </p> <p>Mr Brown believes the plan is \"an innovative proposal\" that could speed up the flow of drugs to tackle diseases such as tetanus, measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B, yellow fever and rotavirus (gastroenteritis). The chancellor also sees it as a pilot for his proposed International Finance Facility, a plan to double global aid to $100bn a year through the sale of bonds. </p> <p>\"If, through these means, resources available to immunisation could be scaled up significantly, we have the opportunity to avert two to three million vaccine-preventable deaths every year, especially considering the new vaccines becoming available in the near future.\" </p> <p>Treasury officials said the chancellor had discussed the project with Mr Gates, who has pledged part of his personal fortune to the immunisation campaign. The British and French governments, with the World Bank, Gavi and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are now working out the final details. \"Bill Gates is a big supporter,\" one source said. \"This is going to be a public-private partnership. </p> <p>The proposal is to float 15-year government-backed bonds in the world's capital markets. There would be two five-year disbursement phases followed by a five-year period in which those who bought the bonds would be repaid. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs has been working on the financial details of the plan and the City solicitors Linklaters have been handling the legal arrangements. </p> <p>The Treasury expects that pledges of $400m a year in private and public money could generate 10 times that amount by bond sales. </p> <p>Investors would have confidence in the investment because they would be guaranteed by governments. </p> <p>Gavi estimates that 10 million children under the age of five die every year, and believes that immunisation is vital if the UN is to meet its target of cutting infant mortality by two-thirds by 2015. </p> <p>\"Two to three million children die of vaccine-preventable diseases every year,\" it said. </p> <p>\"If 95% of children in the poorest countries were to be immunised with existing, and new vaccines by 2015, up to 2 million children could be saved every year.\" </p> <p>Gavi said the extra money would be spent on effective programmes in 56 low-income countries and on providing more affordable vaccines in middle-income states. </p> <p>In a four-pronged strategy, it would strengthen healthcare systems in poor countries so they could reach the 25% of children not covered by vaccination programmes. </p> <p>It would also embark on a long-term programme of buying new and under-utilised vaccines, launch campaigns to provide nationwide immunity, and stockpile oral polio vaccine for an attempt to eradicate the disease.</p>",
  "Michael Howard will attempt tomorrow to secure his long-delayed political breakthrough with a keynote speech on crime, including measures to restore respect, end the rights culture and free up police time to deal with persistent offenders. <p>In a speech that has echoes of his tough stance as home secretary in the 90s, Mr Howard will blame the decline in personal responsibility and the growth of a rights culture as contributing to a breakdown of respect in society. </p> <p>He will also argue that the decline in responsibility lies at the heart of the crime increase, and that measures to restore responsibility are the precursor to urban renewal. </p> <p>His speech will be made on a visit to Middlesbrough to meet Ray Mallon, the Mayor of Middlesbrough - the so-called Robocop who has championed zero tolerance of disorder. </p> <p>Mr Mallon specialises in ensuring that the council employs community wardens, litter enforcement officers and traffic wardens who fight against local environmental crimes, freeing up the police to focus on proactive policing to tackle more serious crime. </p> <p>The Tories hope that they will go into the next election with a draw on education and health, but surge ahead on their traditional ground of asylum and crime. </p> <p>In a move away from his old rhetoric of \"prison works\", Mr Howard will say that \"in many ways the police, our courts and the prison service are simply picking up the pieces of other people's failures\". </p> <p>He will argue: \"As a society we are in danger of being overrun by values which eat away at people's respect for themselves, each other, their homes and their neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"Most damaging of all has been the dramatic decline in personal responsibility. Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions. It's someone else's, or something else's fault - the environment, society, the government.\" </p> <p>Although the speech will contain tough new criminal justice measures, Mr Howard will stress that the causes of crime lie in the need to ensure parental responsibility. However, he will be careful to eschew any suggestion that children cannot be parented well outside marriage. </p> <p>\"Children, especially boys, benefit hugely from a male influence in their lives. Of course this isn't always possible because a large number of men simply abandon their responsibilities as fathers.\" </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, will counter with a consultation paper this week setting out plans to give police extra powers to levy duties on publicans and give extra powers to community support officers to detain people for anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>Mr Howard's speech comes as the Tories released a Home Office internal survey showing morale in the immigration and nationality department at rock bottom. </p> <p>The leaked survey of Home Office workers has revealed that only 33% of employees feel that it is safe for them to challenge the way that things are done in Mr Blunkett's department.</p>",
  "<p>August is a strange month. Supposedly, the financial markets are in a state of torpor, but in recent years that has not always been the case. Weird stuff happens, be it Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, the attempted coup against Gorbachev or the Russian debt default. This year the story is oil. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, the price of oil on the futures exchanges has crept up and up and on Friday night it was nudging $45 a barrel. The expectation is that it may go higher. </p> <p>\"Fifty, sixty dollars a barrel is thinkable for the first time since 1979 ... But so much has changed between then and now that prices might have to go even higher before demand growth slows down,\" said Deborah White, senior economist at SG Commodities in Paris. </p> <p>There is no single explanation for why oil is currently so expensive. Strong global demand is certainly an important factor, with China's explosive growth rates putting pressure on the capacity of oil producers. There is enough crude to go round, but only just. The lack of wriggle room means any threatened disruption to the flow of oil has a rapid impact on prices, so it's not difficult to see why the shenanigans at Yukos have made oil dealers jittery. The Russian company accounts for around 1.6m barrels per day - 2% of global daily output - which is similar to the increase in production that Opec promised at the start of June. </p> <p>These are the circumstances in which speculators flourish. Hedge funds attract high-rolling investors by promising to make them hefty returns on their funds, but that requires volatility. In recent months, little has been happening to stocks, bonds or currencies, so the hedge funds have been piling into the one market that has seen some action - oil. </p> <p>But speculation cannot explain everything. Some oil analysts believe that this upward move is different from those in the past. Then, the price tended to spike as a result of a shock; this time the rise has been steadier, suggesting that the rise is based more on market fundamentals rather than on war, an embargo or any other form of supply disruption. On the gloomiest scenario, we are getting an early taste of life as the oil wells run dry, which means that while the price may jag around, the long-term trend will be up. </p> <p>Stephen Lewis, one of the City's most thoughtful analysts, puts it this way: \"The kind of economic growth rates to which policymakers in the oil consuming countries are committed appear to be generating growth in the demand for oil well above the underlying rate of growth of supply. Higher prices should certainly act as a spur to the development of exploitable oil resources but it is not at all evident where the large oil fields will be found to replace supplies from the US, the Middle East and the North Sea, which all appear to be past their production peaks.\" </p> <p>Lewis draws the obvious conclusions from this analysis: firstly, the west should be embarking on a serious rather than cosmetic attempt at energy conservation; secondly, those who hold out the prospect of a glittering medium-term future for the global economy are perhaps not in full possession of the facts. </p> <p>Actually, the short-term prospects don't look too clever either. In the UK, this could be as good at it gets for growth, with the likelihood that a combination of dearer money and dearer energy eats into household incomes and corporate profitability over the coming months. In the US, the squeeze on real incomes caused by higher gas prices is already starting to have an impact on consumer spending. </p> <p>As Andrew Oswald, economics professor at Warwick, has pointed out, each of the peaks in oil prices since the early 70s has been associated with recession in the west. There is, as Oswald has shown, a strong link between oil prices and US unemployment, and despite what some optimists say the world is still heavily dependent on the black stuff. \"People say oil is no longer important but we are now using over 80m barrels a day of the stuff for the first time. The world economy still turns on oil,\" Oswald says. </p> <p>Consumers are the first to feel the deflationary effects of rising crude prices at the petrol pumps, with the impact only gradually being felt on the bottom line of companies. Unemployment goes up, but only after a lag. </p> <p>There are three possible scenarios for prices over the next year. Scenario one, that they stay at around today's level of $45 a barrel, looks the least likely, both because the oil price is so volatile and because the high oil price affects global output and hence oil prices themselves through a feedback mechanism. If $50 crude prices kill off the global recovery, that will affect demand for fuel and hence its price. </p> <p>Scenario two is that prices go a lot higher and stay there. This could be the result of one big shock, a terrorist attack that took out Saudi production for a prolonged period, for instance, or a series of little shocks - a strike in Venezuela, a stand-off between President Putin and Yukos, a number of terrorist strikes on softer, residential oil compounds in the Middle East, a couple of tankers running aground - that together are enough to push the price well over $50 a barrel. </p> <p>While that would be a lot lower in real inflation-adjusted terms than the record levels seen at the start of the 80s ($80 a barrel in today's money) it would still be enough to cause severe disruption to the west, and perhaps even push some economies into full-scale recession. </p> <p>Finally, scenario three is where everything works out fine. There are no more attacks in the Middle East, Yukos and Putin kiss and make up, signs of an easing in growth blow the speculative froth off the market just as the incentive of higher prices encourages supply to increase. Then, it's not impossible to envisage prices at $25 a barrel by this time next year. </p> <p>Without question, rising oil prices add to the problems facing policymakers. The difficulty they have is that the initial impact is inflationary - pushing up prices and costs - while the second-round effects are deflationary - affecting consumer incomes and corporate cashflow. What policymakers would like is for wage bargainers to take the hit from dearer oil rather than seek compensatory pay increases, and for companies to refrain from passing on their higher costs to their consumers. If they don't, the response will be higher interest rates, which will add to the deflationary impact of the oil shock and thereby increase the risk of a hard landing. In the UK, where the labour market is relatively tight, this autumn will be crucial, because individuals are getting a double whammy from higher oil prices and higher interest rates. </p> <p>Little wonder, then, that some analysts think base rates could go a lot higher, to 6% or more. That's a possibility but by no means a certainty. The last couple of months have seen straws in the wind which suggest that consumer behaviour may be on the turn. Looking through the blizzard of wildly differing reports of the housing market, there is at least a hint that activity is slowing and that prices have - not before time - topped out. New car registrations have fallen in the past three months, another indication that higher interest rates are making people think twice when it comes to big ticket items. </p> <p>August is a funny month. The world often looks a completely different place on a crisp September morning than it did in the heat of late July. The assumption is that the Bank of England is intent on tightening policy over the coming months, but its decisions will depend on the data. If the data is weak, as it may be, interest rates may be close to their peak. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The oil-well troubleshooter Paul N \"Red\" Adair, who has died aged 89, was a swashbuckling 20th-century hero, portrayed fittingly on screen by John Wayne, and he probably did more than any other person single-handedly to preserve the environment. The fires he extinguished were so enormous that they threatened to be dangerous contributors to global warming, or the potential causes of intercontinental air pollution disasters. <p>His greatest feat came when he was in his seventies - confronting 117 gigantic oil-well infernos that dominated the horizon in Kuwait, the legacy of Saddam Hussein's departing Iraqi troops after the first Gulf war. Adair and his crews finished putting out the fires in nine months, as opposed to the five years first envisaged, without a single casualty, and indeed the 5ft 7in boss maintained that none of his employees had ever suffered a serious injury while firefighting. </p> <p>As well as a charismatic risk taker, Adair was an astute businessman, creating various enterprises throughout his life. As well as pioneering semi-submersible firefighting vessels and the design of oil derricks deployed in the North Sea, he also contributed to the technical advancement of various marine firefighting boats and water guns. </p> <p>Born in the American oil capital of Houston, Texas, as soon as he could toddle, he witnessed the power of fire in the workshop of his blacksmith father, Charles. But it was a large, poor family, and young Red - so nicknamed for the colour of his hair - left Reagan high school early to take on various jobs before joining the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1936. </p> <p>Two years later he got his first oil job, for the Otis Pressure Control Co in the fields around Houston. Here he learned from the bottom up the skills of extracting \"black gold\" from the earth. When the US joined the war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Adair served in the 139th Bomb Disposal Squad, and rose to staff sergeant. His work on unexploded shells and bombs in Japan taught him two skills that would serve him well later: how to utilise and control explosives safely, and how to keep a cool head under extreme pressure and danger. </p> <p>He returned to Houston after the war and went to work with Myron Kinley, who had established the techniques of oil-well blowout and fire control. He stayed with Kinley for 14 years before forming his own Red Adair Co, where he perfected the methods for controlling \"wild wells\". At the same time, he developed a flamboyant public persona, capitalising on his nickname with bright red firefighting uniforms and helmets, a red logo, and red accoutrements, replicas of which he would later sell to fans. </p> <p>He and his crews were soon averaging 42 fires a year, extinguished or controlled, all over the world, inland and at sea. The Adair teams completed more than 1,000 assignments internationally through using explosives and drilling mud and concrete. In 1968 the film Hellfighters came out, with Wayne starring as Adair. </p> <p>Adair scored numerous firsts in conquering oil-well fires, including capping the first US land well, extinguishing an underwater wild well, and a fire on a large vessel at sea. He got big press coverage for the Catco offshore fire (1959), the \"Devil's Cigarette Lighter\" in the Sahara desert (1962), a massive offshore blaze in the Bay Marchand field off the Louisiana coast (1970), the Bravo blowout in the North Sea (1977), the Ixtoc blowout in the Gulf of Mexico (1979), and the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea (1988), after an explosion had killed 167 oil workers. </p> <p>When Adair arrived in Kuwait in early March 1991, there were fires everywhere. Thick black smoke made it impossible to get any sense of direction. Adair and his teams were housed in ransacked buildings, but most serious was a lack of equipment - and water. </p> <p>He decided to exploit pipelines used to carry oil from stations in the oilfields to the Persian Gulf. These would be reversed to carry salt water from the Gulf back to fight the fires, a plan that required pumping the 1.5bn gallons of water that were eventually used. Adair had to fly to Washington in June to testify in order to get his equipment. With his flair for showmanship, he showed a dramatic slide presentation, explaining that extinguishing a fire is not the most difficult part. What happens afterwards is the most dangerous, because while the well is still blowing it can flash and reignite, killing the crew on top of it. </p> <p>Adair met President George Bush the following day to express his concerns, and got a pledge of support. By early July, the equipment began rolling into Kuwait, and by November the Emir of Kuwait ceremoniously extinguished the last fire. </p> <p>Adair retired when he sold his company in 1994. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Kemmie, daughter Robyn and son Jimmy. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Paul Neal (Red) Adair, firefighter, born June 18 1915; died August 7 2004</p>",
  "<p>Few television events are as memorable as a big Olympic games moment. Whether it's the good (Steve Redgrave rowing to gold in Sydney), the bad (Zola Budd tripping up Mary Decker in Los Angeles) or the ugly (Ben Johnson's drug-fuelled dash in Seoul), every games throws up at least one moment that will be replayed ad infinitum. </p> <p>But at the end of a long summer of sport, with storm clouds gathering over the insidious problem of drugs and a paucity of British medal hopes, the 2004 games faces a bigger battle than ever to compete with the ubiquity of football. A glance through the sports pages over the past few weeks confirms the extent of the challenge - acres of newsprint devoted to the shambolic goings on at the Football Association, plenty of pre-season transfer tittle-tattle and nary a mention of the upcoming games. The apathy is mirrored on the ground in Athens. Following the euphoria over Greece's unexpected Euro 2004 triumph, ticket sales for the Olympics have been slow. </p> <p>BBC director of sport Peter Salmon admits it is a tussle that is hard to win. \"It's a battle to keep football in check. Football has eclipsed everything. It's only the Olympics that can punch its weight and provide a window for those other sports,\" he argues. \"It's an ongoing struggle. Arguably, the Olympic movement is more embattled than ever.\" </p> <p>But Salmon remains equally convinced that the huge commitment from broadcasters around the world, which collectively spend billions on covering the games, is not only justified but essential. \"It tunes in perfectly with that public service spirit. Truly global sporting events are the closest you get to something religious or spiritual in an increasingly secular world,\" he insists. In line with this crusading ethos, he believes that the corporation has a duty to licence fee payers to bring the games to as wide an audience as possible. \"The public would be scandalised if the BBC didn't support the Olympics.\" </p> <p>As Kylie Minogue was prancing on a giant flip-flop to bring the curtain down on the successful Sydney Olympics four years ago, the thoughts of Martin Hopkins, veteran executive producer of the BBC's coverage, were already turning to this summer's event in Athens. \"Planning starts as soon as the last one finishes. It's a gradual process, about what changes you're making from the last one. Technology is moving along and you're trying to keep up with it,\" says Hopkins, who will retire after the Athens games, having worked on every Olympics since 1968. </p> <p>For Hopkins, the games, which begin on Friday, represent the culmination of four years' hard work. And for the corporation in general, the Olympics are not only a huge opportunity but also a big gamble. BBC Sport is devoting more airtime and resources than ever before to covering events in Athens. Over 1,250 hours of coverage across BBC1, BBC2 and its interactive digital channels, along with groundbreaking live footage over broadband, will mean little escape for viewers. </p> <p>Steve Rider, the BBC presenter who will be the main face of its Olympics output, insists that it is the scale of the corporation's coverage that provides the opportunity to uncover the unlikely heroes that characterise a successful games. </p> <p>\"When you put the tag Olympic games at the end and there's a gold medal on offer, everybody suddenly becomes an expert and gets interested,\" said Rider, who has worked on five Olympics. \"Who'd have thought curling would be such a big hit in Salt Lake City or that we'd get seven million viewers staying up until 1am to watch the rowing in Sydney?\" </p> <p>The new interactive element, which will provide live coverage of four extra sports in addition to the main BBC1 and BBC2 action, offers a massive opportunity to bring even more sports to public prominence. \"What we do is provide a comprehensiveness that sucks people in and drives millions of people to quite specialist sports,\" says Salmon. But he adds that British sports bodies must maintain their side of the bargain to capitalise on the shop window offered by the Olympics. \"The problem afterwards for British sport is that it doesn't have the tactical awareness to grab people's imagination. We're always looking to start new partnerships and look for the next sport to break through,\" he says. </p> <p>Dave Gordon, head of major events at BBC Sport and editorially responsible for the coverage from Athens, also believes that reports of the death of the Olympics have been exaggerated. \"There's still a great enthusiasm for the Olympics. It's the ultimate in sport. No TV station is doing any more than we're doing and we're maximising the rights we have.\" </p> <p>Both Gordon and Hopkins are enthusiastic about the possibilities offered by the interactive broadcasts, through which fans of minority sports will be able to watch, say, baseball or gymnastics for hours on end. \"The thing about the Olympics is that it generates 3,500 hours of television and up to now we've only been able to scratch the surface. It's a wonderful facility to have and I'm looking forward to seeing how the British public take to it,\" says Gordon. </p> <p>The importance that the BBC places on the games also ties in with the seismic shift in the TV sports landscape over the past decade. Following the initial shock when BSkyB began outbidding the BBC for every event going, the two have settled down into a kind of equilibrium. Sky has cornered the market, and driven innovation, in sporting events that drive pay-TV subscriptions - such Premier League and Champions League football. Meanwhile, under Salmon and former director general Greg Dyke, the BBC has carefully cultivated an image as the place where the nation comes together for the one-off events like Wimbledon, the World Cup and the Olympics. </p> <p>Appropriately enough, given the host country, much remains in the lap of the gods. An early British gold, an unexpected boost for a hitherto minority sport or even a major scandal could provide the spark that makes it a games to remember. \"The ideal is a British gold on the first day, closely followed by a Greek gold,\" says Hopkins. \"What we're hoping for is lots of those watercooler moments,\" confirms Gordon. </p> <p>Salmon believes that the Olympics needs the BBC, and other free-to-air broadcasters around the world, as much as the BBC needs the games. \"They realised that the quickest death for the Olympics would be to forge a relationship with a pay-TV operator. It would quickly dwindle into obscurity,\" he says, explaining the International Olympic Committee's recent decision to award the rights to the next two Olympics to the European Broadcasting Union, the coalition of free-to-air broadcasters of which the BBC is a member. \"I didn't lose any sleep over it. They recognise the value we bring. Otherwise it would be picked off by various commercial interests and most of the 20-plus sports would be ignored.\" </p> <p>He hopes that the strength of this symbiotic relationship will continue to be enough to fuel public interest in the games despite the challenges it faces. The corporation refuses to say how much it costs to cover the two-week event, but industry insiders estimate it at around \u00a312m, on top of the cost of the rights. Given that, and the fact that the schedules will be dominated by the games for two weeks, can it really justify the cost if public interest wanes? Salmon believes so, and emphatically. </p> <p>\"It's summer, there's not a lot on. People are looking for something special. It's a massive event that brings people together and if you opt out you're kind of opting out of society. Bring on the drama.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Digital technology means that several British newspapers, including the Guardian and the Observer, will be printing editions in Athens during the Olympic games. </p> <p>The technology means small runs are viable, negating the need for the production of plates from which pages are printed. Print firm Oc\u00e9 claims to be able to print anything from one to 10,000 copies. </p> <p>The Telegraph and FT are also involved, along with other papers from around the world.</p>",
  "<p>The Olympics naturally attracts more than its fair share of scandal and controversy, but it does have one resource to help it overcome these problems - money. The revenues generated by the Athens Olympics - projected to exceed $3.3bn - will be more than any previous games, and will again highlight the massive potential earning power of the modern Olympics, and why there is now such demand from individual countries to host them. </p> <p>The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) income comes from two major sources - broadcast rights fees and sponsorship, with significant contributions also coming through ticketing and licensing agreements. </p> <p>Broadcast rights fees and sponsorship have contributed just over $2.5bn to the IOC in the run-up to this year's games and this is a direct result of the expected worldwide TV audiences. The Athens games will be seen in around 225 countries and will attract a global audience of over four billion. </p> <p>One of the reasons the Olympics outscores the (football) World Cup lies across the Atlantic. America's passion for sport is (in its own vernacular) awesome. But its sporting staples of American football, baseball, basketball and Nascar are all designed to feed the home market. The Olympics provide America with one of the nation's rare opportunities to compete on the world stage. This being the case, Americans love the games, and so too do their major television networks. Broadcasting rights fees are the largest single source of income for the IOC. The broadcasting rights revenues for Athens will top $1.5bn, just over half of which comes from America. </p> <p>Sponsorship is the other key contributor to the IOC's coffers. There are 11 key sponsors, whose agreements will all last for at least four years, which will include one summer and one winter games. The demand from sponsors to be a part of the Olympics is stronger than ever despite the fact that tobacco and alcohol sponsors are precluded from involvement. </p> <p>In Athens companies such as Coca-Cola, Kodak, McDonald's, Panasonic, Swatch, Visa and Xerox have each committed in excess of $50m to be one of the elite sponsors of the event and to have the right to use the prestigious rings in their advertising and promotional activity. </p> <p>Many of these companies have had long term relationships with the IOC. They know the value of the Olympics to them and they know how to make them work for their brands. This is crucial because, unlike other major sporting events such as the (football) World Cup, they don't benefit from athletes in the playing arenas being backed by perimeter advertising or interview backdrop boards. </p> <p>The sponsors, of course, all have different objectives and target markets. Fast-moving consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's, need to reach all genders and age groups, whereas companies such as John Hancock and Samsung will be eyeing a more targeted approach. Ticketing, hospitality and VIP passes to key areas and functions will be important benefits, which the sponsors will be looking to make optimum use of in a bid to impress their top customers as well as giving themselves an edge over their competitors. </p> <p>Not that the sponsors' competitors are likely to get much opportunity to ambush the event. The most stringent policing and monitoring of non-official marketing activity will be in place during the Olympics. Every effort is being made to ensure that nothing interferes with the official sponsors' ability to maximise their returns on their considerable investments. </p> <p>Of course it is not just the 11 key sponsors who are involved in the Games. There are different tiers of sponsors and suppliers including sponsorship packages for all of the National Olympic committees. In the UK, the British Olympic Committee has its own stable of sponsors who support the British team and provide funds and resources to help with training and other costs. Companies such as DIY giant B&amp;Q have linked up with the British Olympic team and are looking to develop their growing reputations as international brands, as well as engaging their employees and customers. </p> <p>For the sponsors involved in Athens, the perceived link with the spirit and ideals of the Olympics movement is a key element. The Olympics offers these sponsors the opportunity to associate themselves with some outstanding performances and extraordinary feats of human endeavour. No other world sporting event can do this. </p> <p>The 2008 games will take place in Beijing, and that will open up the massive and as yet relatively untapped Chinese market. From a financial point of view, Athens will be a huge success. And as the athletes begin their quest for gold, the IOC can relax - they've already struck it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Nigel Currie is vice president, Europe, of sports marketing company The GEM Group.

  "The prospects for a modern social democracy look bleak. Downing Street and its outriders are setting out an agenda for a third term - individualised consumer choice in health and education - which is hard to distinguish from Tory policy and for which there is little enthusiasm among public or party. Given the volatility of contemporary politics, it is by no means impossible that Labour will lose in a reverse landslide. But the most likely outcome is that we will stumble across the line first, and, as with the Tories after 1992, the electorate may soon resent us and our fall in the next crisis could be sweeping. Unlike the Thatcherites, we won't have transformed the political, economic and social landscape - despite the benefit of huge majorities, a pathetically weak opposition and a strong economy. <p>The European results are another indication that the party hierarchy does not realise what a hole it is in. They demonstrated the dealignment of political loyalties that has been accelerating under New Labour. We know of many members (not diehard leftists) who did not vote or voted for the Greens or other parties. The government is puzzled, citing the strength of the \"economic fundamentals\", low unemployment and record investment in public services. </p> <p>In its script, disaffection is framed in the traditional narrative of mid-term blues. If it really believes this, it is making a big mistake. The dominant feeling in the electorate is not so much that there are no differences between the parties, but rather that two terms of office with huge majorities haven't made a difference and parties don't behave any differently in power. On the crest of a political wave unrivalled since 1945, New Labour has been unable or unwilling to change the political weather. Worse, our democracy has been eroded, there is no new politics and trust in politicians is at an all-time low. </p> <p>New Labour has burnt so much political capital, but for what end? Most of the progressive policies, such as devolution and minimum wage, are first term and can be considered as much old Labour as New. It looks as if the second term will be remembered for Iraq. None of the rationales for the war stands up: there are no weapons of mass destruction; and the country, the region and the world are not safer places. Tragically, Tony Blair still appears to believe that if he can only explain it one more time, we will get it. But we get the message - we just don't accept it. Iraq is Blair's poll tax, a fundamental breach of trust, demonstration of arrogance and strategic blunder for which the party as a whole is paying the price. </p> <p>New Labour's timidity has always been framed by certain assumptions: that Britain is a conservative country and elections can only be won from the centre ground; that the forces of global capitalism are ideologically and practically given; that markets and choice enable us to compete efficiently in the global economy, and must flourish in public and private sectors; and that the role of the modern state is to equip workers to thrive on the opportunities of globalisation. The Conservatives, who see no active role for the state, are thus an obstacle to Britain's ability to compete in the global economy and must be kept out of office at all cost. </p> <p>The strategy defines Tony Blair as the best leader in Labour's history for marginalising the opposition. But the cost to social democrats is debilitating. Sure we have power, but are denied the means to do anything purposeful with it. This is the Blair Catch 22. We are saddled with a historically low level of taxation to spend on public services and to redistribute, we are privatising the public services, if more humanely than the Tories, and we are denying the possibility of a social democratic Europe, the only talk being about where we draw our \"red lines\" and sustaining a world order defined by Bush. </p> <p>We have supported Blair's leadership. We were never uncritical Blairites, but we did think that Blair would open up spaces to renew social democracy. We were wrong. That promise of a new politics has receded and it is obvious there is no point waiting for a better Blair. </p> <p>The stakes are simply too high to accept that there is no alternative for Labour supporters. What is at stake is not just the radical intent of a third term, and therefore victory at a fourth election, but the viability of the party. Recent events echo the collapse of the Tories: first you lose your members, then your councillor base; and finally after an epiphany (such as Black Wednesday) the fall among the wider public is frighteningly fast. Frustrated by years of neglect, clearer threats of disengagement are being made from within the unions. When sensible left-of-centre figures such as Kevin Curran of the GMB prophesy a break, we have to take notice. </p> <p>The party and its supporters must ask themselves: Is this as good as it gets? The leadership's answer is \"Yes - what is not on offer is the Labour government of your dreams\". But it's not a dream we want: just a better Labour government. </p> <p>The future may or not be bright, but will it be Brown? The social democratic successes of this government belong primarily to Gordon. If he becomes leader, then the party will be more at ease with itself, the pace of redistribution could increase and the public sector will be safer from privatisation. But questions remain. Much of the caution, particularly over Europe, is down to him. There have been few signs that Brown will embrace a new politics. If he simply takes us on a path of more coherent Blairism, then the motive for change is greatly diminished. But Gordon does have the potential to be more radical. Britain is not necessarily a conservative country - rather its people, like those of every country, have the potential to be either conservative or radical, progressive or regressive. What matters is the political leadership and the ambition to shift the centre of gravity to the left. </p> <p>Labour needs a new direction, not just a new leader. Social democracy and capitalism cannot be triangulated - more of one means less of the other. The job of social democratic governments is to draw and redraw the lines between democracy and the market, the individual and the collective, the public and the private. If we give in to the principle of market supremacy then we won't know where or how to draw those lines. Worse still, we end up not knowing that lines have to be drawn at all. </p> <p>Social democracy cannot take root in the shadow cast by neo-liberalism. Ultimately we have to define our own agenda for a realisable radical transfor mation. If others offer an alternative leadership, then we want to hear their ideas. If the party is to survive, it must relearn the habits of critical debate. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, the next manifesto is being posed by Downing Street as consolidators (read Brownites) v radical reformers (read Blairites). The battleground is choice, but the initial one is to be made by the party and movement. Are we prepared to risk defeat with the bogus radicalism and burned-out legitimacy of the New Labour project, or can we remarshall our forces around a genuine social democratic programme? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson are editors of the Labour journal Renewal; this is an extract from the next editorial and was written with the collaboration of fellow editor Sue Goss </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:neal@renewal.org.uk\">neal@renewal.org.uk</a></p>"
