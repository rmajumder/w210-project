  "<p>MG Rover is seeking savings of \u00a3100m as it tries to get its drive towards profitability back on track in the face of a continuing slump in its share of the UK car market. </p> <p>So far this year the company's Rover marque has seen its market share fall by almost a fifth while the MG marque is down 8%, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) yesterday. </p> <p>Fewer than 31,000 Rovers were registered in the year to the end of August, compared with 38,500 in the same period last year, while MG registrations fell from almost 23,000 to slightly more than 21,000. </p> <p>Last month the two marques accounted for less than 2% of the British market, with Rover registrations falling below 1,000 and MG selling fewer than 800 cars. </p> <p>An MG Rover spokeswoman said: \"The figures are disappointing. August is a particularly tough month with the [registration] plate change coming up in September. For a company like MG Rover, which is not chasing loss-making business, it is even tougher.\" </p> <p>The SMMT calculates that August represents about 3% of full-year sales, compared with 17% for September. </p> <p>According to the Financial Times, MG Rover's cost-cutting programme is designed to kick-start its stalled recovery, with last year's financial performance showing only a modest improvement on 2002, when it lost \u00a395m. </p> <p>A special committee has been set up to look at ways of ensuring the company is in the black for at least some months by the end of next year. </p> <p>Yesterday MG Rover's spokeswoman declined to discuss the cost-cutting plan but said: \"I don't think it's a surprise that any business losing money would be looking at ways of reducing costs.\" </p> <p>Asked if that could mean job losses, she said MG Rover would look for savings \"across the whole of the business\". </p> <p>As part of its strategy MG Rover is in talks with China's most powerful domestic car company, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), over a \"far-reaching strategic cooperation\" as the firm seeks to extend its global reach. </p> <p>MG Rover has not given details of the likely collaboration, though last month it dis missed suggestions that SAIC would take an equity stake in the British company. Yesterday the spokeswoman said the discussions were continuing. </p> <p>August was a difficult month for the UK car industry with overall sales down by almost 5% to just under 85,000 units. However, the total for the year to date was up 1% at 1.65m. </p> <p>Christopher Macgowan, the SMMT's chief executive, played down the August figures. \"Growth that has sustained the market for the last four years has eased a little in recent months and it will be the September figures that tell us if a strong start to 2004 will bring a fourth consecutive record year.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's figures proved a mixed blessing for Land Rover, where executives and unions at the Solihull works are due to table a revised strategic plan to its owner, Ford, tomorrow. Overall sales to date are up 5% on the same period last year but August showed a 24% fall. </p> <p>Land Rover's managing director, Matthew Taylor, has been quoted as saying the Solihull plant could face a \"slow and lingering death\" if it cannot win backing for the plan. </p> <p> <strong> theguardian.com/car</strong></p>",
  "\"I must say that, as occupiers, the US are a most inefficient lot,\" the Iraqi artist Nuha al-Radi, who has died aged 63, wrote early last year. \"Since we are to learn the American way of life, and suing is a hundred per cent of it, we should start suing the US and the coalition for making war under false pretences. I don't think the Americans have a clue about this country or what to do with it.\" <p>In recent months, Nuha also talked, semi-seriously, of suing for the leukaemia that killed her - leukaemia that she thought might be connected to the hundreds of tonnes of depleted uranium the allies fired at Iraqi tanks during the 1991 war. She felt she would be speaking for all Iraqis who linked their cancers to the radioactive particles and toxins that were exploded into their environment, and from there, she argued, into the water table and food chain. </p> <p>As an artist, Nuha was as versatile as she was talented. Over the years, her ceramics, sculptures and paintings were shown throughout the Arab world and in the west, and exhibited in collections, including the British Museum. But it was as a critic of sanctions, war and occupation - \"humiliation\" - that she found unexpected celebrity, publishing her Baghdad Diary in the literary magazine Granta in 1992 and a book, Baghdad Diaries, in 1998. </p> <p>Whatever medium she was using, Nuha drew on the people, events and materials around her. She depicted moods and events - in clear, crisp colours in her art, and devastating detail in her diaries. She preferred the personal to the political and humour to ranting, although she could rant with the best of them when the mood took her - not only about the allies but about \"the muddled east\" and the failure of Arabs \"to learn the meaning of 'unity' or 'initiative'\". </p> <p>Thus when Saddam Hussein decreed that graduates could import cars duty free, and intellectuals began driving Mercedes, Nuha held an exhibition of sculpture in Baghdad that had only two components, cars and brains. Model Mercedes had brains oozing from their windows; brains flew Mercedes flags. When the invasion of Iraq began, she exhibited her Embargo Art - rows of figures made from recycled wood, painted and decked out in feathers and other defiant finery. \"They look as if they are demonstrating,\" she wrote. \"Hopefully, we will recycle ourselves and survive.\" </p> <p>Ian Jack, the current editor of Granta, said that the periodical had no hesitation in publishing Nuha's first manuscript: \"Her diaries were direct, witty, humane, so that you saw large things, like wars and occupations, intimately. Good diarists are rarer than many people imagine. The temptation for the diarist is to inflate himself or herself, to over-write, to have Big Thoughts. Nuha persuaded you by her matter-of-factness. Like most good writing, it is beautifully specific - a record of cake-making and flower-tending as well as of a blitz.\" </p> <p>Born in Baghdad, Nuha spent most of her childhood in India, where her father was ambassador. He retired when the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown in 1958, and the family returned to Baghdad. In 1961, Nuha moved to London to study ceramics at the Byam Shaw School of Art and work with the Chelsea Pottery. </p> <p>Her parents moved to Beirut in 1969 after the Ba'ath party seized power in Iraq. She enrolled in liberal arts at the American University of Beirut and, in 1971, began teaching there. When the Lebanese civil war erupted in 1975, she returned to Baghdad. It was the beginning of 30 years spent shuttling, \"trying to avoid coups and wars\". </p> <p>Beirut was, for Nuha, \"the perfect place for political exiles\", a place where \"the right to grumble\" had not been banned, and where she was happiest. She loved the city's mix of people, the ease of life, the stray cats she nurtured but never attempted to domesticate. Friendship was perhaps her greatest gift, and her house was seldom empty. </p> <p>Gardening was a passion: when she felt aggressive, she cut and pruned; when she felt hopeful, she planted. But even Nuha could not make flowers bloom on her windy, sea-facing balcony, a narrow strip so different from her beloved palm orchard in Baghdad. </p> <p>Nuha was buried in Beirut's pine forest, lying in a bed of jasmine and with flowers, her favourite adornment, in her irrepressible hair. She is survived by her mother Suad, brother Abbad, sister Selma and aunt Naira. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Nuha al-Radi, artist and diarist, born January 27 1941; died August 31 2004</p>",
  "<p>A massive asset sale by Shell that brought in $3.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in the first half of the year continued yesterday when the troubled oil group sold off some of its Egyptian interests for $235m. </p> <p>The 40% holding in the Rosetta concession - which is already producing gas in the Nile delta region - was to have been bought by Kuwaiti interests. Britain's BG stepped in, however, and exercised its pre-emption rights on the shares. </p> <p>Shell said Rosetta had limited synergies with the rest of its business in Egypt and raising cash this way enabled it to \"focus resources on higher-value opportunities\". </p> <p>The latest shake-out comes on top of disposals in Bangladesh, the United States and Angola this year. The company has traditionally sold off about $2bn worth of what it deemed lower-grade interests every year. </p> <p>But the crisis of confidence that hit Shell this year when it cut its proven reserve estimates by 20%, has triggered more vigorous action. The company increased its capital expenditure from $13bn a year to nearly $15bn this year. </p> <p>Some of this cash has gone on overspends in places such as the Nigerian Bonga field and Russia's Sakhalin project, but more money is also being pumped into new exploration and production. </p> <p>The reserves downgrade - which triggered the departure of its chairman of managing directors, Sir Philip Watts, and others - has turned the spotlight on Shell's poor record for replacing reserves. </p> <p>It has fallen behind its biggest rivals, BP and ExxonMobil, so is attempting to make up lost ground. </p> <p>The Middle East and north Africa are seen by all the oil companies as attractive for future business. Shell is at the forefront of efforts to open up Libya as well as the Western Desert in Egypt. </p> <p>But it is also a good time to sell assets because soaring global crude and gas prices have caused their value to increase. There are buyers around because oil companies are awash with cash. </p> <p>BG's managing director for Africa, Stuart Fysh, described the Rosetta purchase from Shell as \"an excellent opportunity\" to increase its position to 80% in a high-quality concession in which it is already an operator. </p> <p>The Rosetta concession has three development leases as well as a producing field which are at present the subject of negotiations with the Egyptian government. </p> <p>Shell is in the middle of a wide-ranging review of the future of the business and is due to outline a new strategy on September 22. In November it will give details of action over an even more critical issue: the future structure and governance of the company. </p> <p><strong>$3.5bn and counting...</strong></p> <p>Shell raised $3.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in the first half of 2004:</p> <p><strong>Bangladesh</strong> Upstream assets</p> <p><strong>United States</strong> Power assets, product pipelines, Delaware City Refinery, Teneska Power Company</p> <p><strong>Angola</strong> Block 18</p> <p><strong>Portugal</strong> Service stations and distribution assets </p> <p><strong>UK</strong> Some upstream assets</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong> A 5.27% interest in VNG downstream gas distribution company</p> <p><strong>Mexico</strong> Gas pipelines</p> <p><strong>China</strong> Shares in Sinopec </p> <p>Further sales since July 1:</p> <p><strong>Peru</strong> Divested service station network, industrial and local marine fuels business to Enap</p> <p><strong>Thailand</strong> Sold its 64% share in Rayong refinery</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong> Intention to sell retail and commercial businesses</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong> Sold 9.96% of the total shares in Showa Shell to Saudi Aramco</p> <p><strong>Egypt</strong> 40% stake in Rosetta concession to BG</p>",
  "The carnage at Beslan leads to three important inferences for all policy-makers countering terrorism. First, that Islamic terrorists anywhere in the world can stoop to any level of cruelty to further their separatist agenda. Second, that they have been ruthlessly taking advantage of the democratic and secular nations to inflict great damage without fear of retaliation. And third, that the fiasco of the war on terror has brought into the open the lack of unity and conviction among the democratic nations of the world in dealing with terrorism and separatism, which in turn has further emboldened the will of the fundamentalist and jihadi forces around the globe. <p>The unflinching US patronage of Pakistan, the foremost exporter of fundamentalism and terror, is a glaring example. The west's involvement in the break-up of the Soviet Union and the EU's criticism of Russia's hardline policy in Chechnya are other instances of dangerous imprudence. </p> <p>The tears of the families of the innocent children massacred in Beslan will not dry up in a hundred 100 years. But perhaps it is not yet too late for the democratic and secular nations to unite in massive retaliation against the terrorists and the religion-based nations that encourage them. Otherwise, the very existence of progressive civilisation will be at stake.<br><b>Shivaji Moitra</b><br>Calcutta, India </p> <p>Every time there is a new terrorist atrocity in Russia, it soon becomes clear that the security forces botched at least some aspect of it, from ignoring warning signs to mishandling the event itself. Just as predictably, President Putin then decrees that the security apparatus needs to be reformed. </p> <p>The trouble is that for Putin, a KGB veteran for whom strong leadership passes as a complete political philosophy, reform means giving them more powers and less democratic accountability. Hand in hand goes a creeping reunification of the divided successors of the KGB. But if Stalin could have the entire Chechen population deported and resettled across Siberia and Central Asia, one in eight dying in the process, what hope do the heirs of the KGB have of forcibly quelling Chechens' desire for independence? </p> <p>The real disaster is that Putin has painted himself into a corner such that any concessions or meaningful political process would seem like weakness, and the only response he is able or willing to consider is escalation and repression. This simply creates the hopelessness and bitterness which has driven the Chechens to terrorism. </p> <p>It should be no surprise that the main source of new terrorists and suicide bombers are the widows and orphans of men the Russians have killed. This is the tragedy that results when an empire which will not let go meets a people who refuse to submit.<br><b>Dr Mark Galeotti</b><br>Keele University </p> <p>The entire world should take responsibility for the terror attacks in Russia. Terrorism has become an acceptable tool of protest. The world has stood by while hundreds of Israelis were killed, always finding excuses to legitimise and \"understand\" the use of terror. Now Russian kids have paid the price for the world's acceptability of terror. The Chechens wanted their cause in the limelight and simply saw how successfully the Palestinians took the focus of global attention by their choice of using terror instead of negotiations.<br><b>Michelle Moshelian</b><br>New Barnet, Herts </p> <p>World leaders condemn the perpetrators of Beslan as \"evil\". But the siege hasn't come out of nowhere, but out of a war which the west has largely ignored. Between 1994 and 1996, the Russian army killed 80,000 Chechens and lost 14,000 of their own troops. The Russians suffered a humiliating defeat, but were back 1999. This phase of the conflict has left up to 50,000 Chechens dead, while 11,000 Russians have died; 230,000 Chechens (a third of the population) are refugees as a result of the war. None of this excuses the perpetrators of the siege. But before the tragedy of Beslan is smothered in cliches, we should understand its root causes.<br><b>Sasha Simic</b><br>London </p> <p>Chechnya is an autonomous republic with its own parliament and the Chechens have more rights than the Kurds in Turkey. The genocidal massacre of Russian civilians is proof that the real aim of the Chechen terrorists is the destruction of Russia, not independence.<br><b>Paul Michaels</b><br>London </p> <p>It's time the media got its head out of the sand. The vile child-killers in Chechnya are radical Islamic terrorists. Using words like \"separatists\" or \"rebels\" gives a benign connotation they don't deserve. We are at war with a ruthless enemy. This is no time for political correctness.<br><b>Barry Sullivan</b><br>San Francisco </p> <p>When the western world, \"bravely\" led by Bush, Blair and the EU, turns its back on disenfranchised, impoverished and persecuted regions of the world, and the Russian government fails to understand the nature of the problems it faces as the inherited institutional structures become more feeble and destabilised, this is what happens. The desperate, the misled, the confused, the downright evil find plenty of room to manoeuvre in Russia's criminalised, institutional vacuum. Expect more of the same. Very, very depressing.

  "Politicians in Moscow are preparing a series of new anti-terror measures that will toughen punishment for terrorist offences and allow the government to override civil liberties, said one lawmaker. <p>The Russian federation council, the upper house of parliament, will meet today to discuss possible new measures, said Stanislav Vavilov, head of the council's committee on law. </p> <p>Russian citizens were prepared to lose some democratic rights if it ensured their safety, he said, Interfax reported. </p> <p>\"If there will be limits to a certain freedom and the rights of citizens then I don't see anything terrible because it is a forced measure,\" said Svetlana Orlova, deputy speaker of the federation council. </p> <p>After the \"barbarian terrorist act\" Russian society needed to understand that they now lived in a different country, said Ms Orlova. </p> <p>Possible measures include cracking down on movement from one part of the country to the other, similar to the system under the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>\"Questions of security have to come first and everything has to be subordinate to that,\" said Ms Orlova. </p> <p>Senators will also discuss the creation of a vast counterterrorism centre that will oversee law enforcement agencies, the Russian security services, and the ministry of defence's work in the North Caucasus. </p> <p>The politicians were echoing President Vladimir Putin's speech to the nation on Saturday when he said a new counter-terrorism centre was needed. </p> <p>In the last four years, the federation council has increasingly become a rubber stamp for Kremlin policy. </p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will meet Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, today for talks likely to centre on the need for greater global anti-terror efforts. </p> <p>An Israeli government official said the visit was arranged long before the latest wave of violence in Russia. </p> <p>In a telephone call to President Putin, Mr Sharon called for expanded intelligence coordination between the two countries. </p> <p>The president of North Ossetia apologised for failing to avert the disaster. </p> <p>\"I fully understand my responsibility,\" Alexander Dzasokhov told doctors and relatives of the wounded children in a hospital in the regional capital Vladikavkaz. </p> <p>\"I want to beg your pardon for failing to protect children, teachers and parents,\" said the regional leader, who was disressed and had tears in his eyes. </p> <p>The interior minister of North Ossetia, Kazbek Dzantiyev, offered his resignation yesterday. </p> <p>\"After what has happened I as an officer, I don't think it is possible for me to remain in my post,\" he said. </p> <p>Russian television reported that his resignation had been turned down. </p> <p>Meanwhile in Chechnya, a policeman and an unknown number of his relatives were kidnapped from his house in Grozny yesterday by masked gunmen, Interfax reported. </p> <p>Russia begins two days of national mourning today for Beslan's terror victims.</p>",
  "How foolish Rosemary and I were to buy modestly priced Epson printers without checking the price of cartridges. A few measly droplets of ink will now cost us \u00a321.99. Much more than blood. But who would think to carry out an in-depth investigation before purchasing a printer? Not us, because although we have endured scoundrelly car mechanics, gardeners, builders and plumbers, we always clung to the belief that not all tradespersons are robbers. Until now, so we have a little moan at the shopkeeper. <p>\"Join the queue,\" says he, because half the world has already complained and he too is enraged by Epson. Although his little shop sells \u00a310,000's worth of ink a month and is one of a chain of hundreds of shops selling squillions of cartridges between them, the very grand Epson persons cannot be bothered to deal with him directly. He must go grovelling to the wholesaler. Up goes the price another notch, and Rosemary and I must pay an arm and two legs for our tiny squirts of ink. </p> <p>I run home and stick my platinum- and jewel-encrusted cartridge into my crap printer, but nothing happens. No printed words come out. While I was running around searching for bargain cartridges, the wretched thing dried up. Now the heads must be cleaned, by squirting ink through them at several pounds a droplet, and by the time printing resumes, three-quarters of my liquid gold has gone. </p> <p>Daughter prints 30 pages of dissertation, first draft, and up pops a yellow warning. I must buy more ink. What? So soon? Back to the shop, quick, before the stinker dries up again. How trade must be booming for the greedy cartridge makers, now that dissertation time is here. I ring for an explanation. How many pages should my cartridge print? </p> <p>\"The industry standard,\" says the Epson Explainer, \"assuming 5% print cover per sheet, is 400 pages, but only if it's one continuous print job.\" What does that mean to the average girlie scribe tapping out her little stories? \"It means 5% cover.\" Clear as bilge water. </p> <p>I hear that the European parliament voted 580 to 8 that people should not design products that cannot be re-used. Our leaders thought this an excellent idea, but not for ink-jet and laser cartridges. Do they consider money more important than our environment? Is something fishy going on? Surely not.</p>",
  "The small group of middle-aged women waiting patiently outside Tonbridge train station in Kent looked unlikely extremists. As a white minibus pulled up and the group, exchanging jolly remarks about the weather, climbed on board, few of the early morning shoppers gave them a second glance. <p>But these women are all frontline activists in the animal rights battle, where Dutch anarchists who boast about breaking into police stations and stealing official records work alongside elderly English women who \"only care about the animals\", run weekly stalls and take \"little interest in politics\". </p> <p>This weekend, more than 300 leading anti-vivisection campaigners from Europe and the United States gathered in Kent for what was dubbed an \"activists' training camp\". </p> <p>The three-day event at a private animal sanctuary 10 miles from Tonbridge, which offered workshops on strategy and tactics, \"hunt sabbing\", self defence and personal security, was shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p>Activists were instructed to call a mobile phone number advertised on the internet when they arrived at the train station and wait for further instructions. Personal mobiles had to be left at the entrance to the site and campaigners were warned to be on the lookout for undercover police and journalists - who were banned from the site apart from a two-hour press briefing on Sunday morning. </p> <p>The warnings were clearly justified: a Guardian reporter attended the event by posing as an activist to find out exactly what strategy and tactics were being discussed in the closed sessions. </p> <p>\"OK, who's the infiltrator?\" asked the driver as the minibus pulled away. \"It's not me,\" joked one of the women. \"I've come along to find out how to make bombs, or at least how to kick a copper properly, I always end up hurting my foot!\" </p> <p>There has been growing concern in recent months about the activities of the militant wing of the movement. The home secretary, David Blunkett, has announced new powers to prevent activists protesting outside the homes of laboratory employees. </p> <p>He also banned the US surgeon and animal rights activist Jarry Vlasak, who has claimed the assassination of scientists working in biomedical research would save millions of animals' lives, from visiting Britain for the event. </p> <p>\"I think it's an outrage,\" said Mary, one of the minibus passengers. \"They let that Muslim preacher in, but not Jarry. They are scared because what he is saying is the truth.\" </p> <p>In the main tent a lecturer on personal security warned his audience that the police were probably bugging their homes and advised anyone wanting to discuss \"private plans\" to do so away from the conference site. He told them to avoid meeting in pubs, which could be bugged, and advised them to burn rather than shred their mail. </p> <p>The speaker added: \"There is a massive difference between security and paranoia but if you are involved, as we all are, in animal rights activities, assume your phone has been tapped and that you are being watched.\" </p> <p>He was not far wrong. A member of the audience who had been spotted taking copious notes was taken to one side and quizzed about his background. His undercover persona may have been undermined by the fact that he was using shorthand and asking questions about bombmaking and other extreme tactics. As he was being grilled and the activists were getting more jumpy, the Guardian beat a dignified retreat to the cafe. </p> <p>For all the organisers' reassurances that the training camp was solely about legal protest, the more extreme elements of the movement were also there - and clearly had the support of many of the activists. </p> <p>A member of the militant Animal Liberation Front, dressed in shorts and T-shirt, drew the largest round of applause when he said: \"What we need is more people who are prepared to put on balaclavas and go out in the middle of the night and take real action, because this is what has raised our profile, that is why we are getting the media attention. </p> <p>\"There are 20 or so people who carry the direct action movement in this country and most of them are here now. But the police know who we are and watch us - this isn't a problem, I've been to prison, I've still got the bottle. But there are people here who I don't know and who I'm sure the police don't know who could do what they want - get away with murder.\" </p> <p>Activists were told the decision to tar get individual companies involved - however tangentially - in vivisection was paying off. </p> <p>\"In the 1980s we turned up for a demonstration outside one company one week then another the next, never putting them under sustained pressure. Now, with organisations like Shac [Stop Huntingdon Life Sciences] and Speak [campaigning against an animal research laboratory in Oxford] we are unrelenting in our pursuit of one organisation and we are winning,\" said one speaker. </p> <p>Other campaigners questioned the direct action tactics of \"home visits\" - where employees of companies are targeted outside work, often having their cars attacked or properties damaged. </p> <p>\"But that is what works,\" replied another. \"I have organised about 20 demonstrations without any interest from the press whatsoever. As soon as we had our first direct action, the phone never stopped ringing with the media asking for interviews. I don't make the rules but that is how it works.\" </p> <p>Greg Avery, the founder of Shac, told the gathering the movement was more successful now than at any stage in its history. He said once the battle against individual companies had been won the movement needed to move into a revolutionary new phase and take on whole sectors of the \"vivisection industry\". </p> <p>But among the rank and file, there were differences of opinion on how the battle should be fought. At the sanctuary, anarchists from Germany and the Netherlands, who dressed in black and wore T-shirts emblazoned with slogans such as \"Fuck Authority\" and \"Global Resistance and Revolution,\" mixed with neatly turned-out women from middle England. </p> <p>\"In the end it is all about the animals, not about us, we mean nothing,\" said an English woman who ran a stall every weekend in her local high street handing out leaflets. </p> <p>The black-clad anarchist from Hamburg was not so sure. \"My life and yours are worth just as much as any animal's. What we are fighting is not just animal abuse at individual companies, but about many things - sexism, racism and oppression and the wider capitalist system.\" </p> <p>But one thing that united all activists was the shared conviction that their cause was a righteous one. Speakers repeatedly likened the movement to the anti-apartheid campaign and the fight against the slave trade, with the media blamed for presenting the activists as extremists. </p> <p>\"Look at the newspapers when those movements were at their peak and there will be the same terms bandied around as there are about us now,\" one said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Labour's seven years of vacillating over a ban on foxhunting will finally end this week when the government announces on Thursday that the Parliament Act will be used to force the measure on to the statute book by mid-October. </p> <p>A debate is however continuing on how quickly the ban will be brought into force, with the possibility that hunts will be given as long as two years to wind down and ensure staff and dogs are found alternative employment.</p>",
  "<p>The bones of a lost Mexican tribe from the baking sands of Baja California have begun to tell a new story of the peopling of the Americas. Orthodoxy has it that the first American colonists crossed the Bering Straits 12,000 years ago at the close of the last Ice Age. They were people of Mongoloid origin from the Siberian steppes, and they spread slowly from Alaska to Patagonia, and they were the ancestors of all native American tribes. And they were brachycephalic: that is, they tended to have short, wide skulls. </p> <p>But the Pericues, a people who went extinct in the 18th century, may tell a different story. Their skulls were dolicephalic: that is, long and thin. Other enigmatic evidence is beginning to emerge of an earlier settlement of America - perhaps as early as 30,000 years ago - by long-headed, seafaring people who may have crossed the Pacific by boat, migrating from island to island, until they reached the US Pacific coastline, Silvia Gonzalez of Liverpool John Moores University, told the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Exeter. </p> <p>\"They appear more similar to southern Asians, Australian and populations of the South Pacific rim than they do to northern Asians,\" she said. \"DNA analysis of the Mexican remains suggest that these people were at least partly contemporaneous to the first native American settlers on the continent. We think there were several migration waves into the Americas at different times by different human groups. The timing, route and point of origin of the first colonisation of the Americas remains the most contentious point in human evolution.\" </p> <p>The Pericues lived an isolated life as hunter-gatherers with stone tools: Jesuit missionaries recorded their existence before they disappeared altogether. Dr Gonzalez's study of the collected bones in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City is the first fruit of 11 projects investigating the role of environment in the evolution and dispersal of humanity, funded by Britain's natural environment research council. \"Diet, dating and dispersal and all of these areas are very new science and we are getting new results to answer questions. said Clive Gamble, of the University of Southampton \"We are interested in the response to climate change.\"</p>",
  "<p>Recent times have seen major improvements in all aspects of our lives - there has been a rise in standards of health, sportsmen and women continue to push the boundaries of physical achievement and technology has revolutionised the way we live our lives. There is no reason that education should be excluded from this list, however, for many this is not the perception and there is a tendency to look back to a 'golden age' in education. At times there appears to be a relentless campaign to undermine the teaching profession, focusing on failings rather than achievements. This has created three problems.</p> <p>The first problem is the result of a period of unprecedented government intervention in education. The strategy has been to determine all that is best and proselytise, cajole or even impose those ideas. The outcome of this approach is that we now have a highly prescribed curriculum, frequent assessment of pupils and accountability systems that are complex, expensive and unfair. Such a degree of central control has had a marked effect on teachers' morale. </p> <p>Being in control is one of the keys to human happiness. As David Myers, professor of psychology at Hope College in the US noted in his book 'The Pursuit of Happiness' 'when workers have more control their job satisfaction rises'. For the professional teacher autonomy, self-determination and responsiveness to the particular needs of pupils is important. I am not advocating total deregulation and have no doubt we need a framework of principles and guidelines, concepts and skills to ensure all pupils gain access to a broad, balanced and relevant curriculum. What I am talking about is professional discretion and responsibility - being able to choose to do the right thing. </p> <p>Well-implemented strategies, for example for literacy and numeracy, can be very effective but there is a need for flexibility. There is a difference between being compelled to follow the strategy and being able to determine what is in the pupils' best interest. </p> <p>If you tell people what they must do, at first they might resist and then once they comply there is a danger that they will become de-skilled -responsibility for their actions lies elsewhere. And if the strategy is not perfect then it fails. </p> <p>The wise teacher will pay due regard to advice and guidance, but they have to make their own sense of it. The problem is that once this freedom has been taken away, trust and confidence are lost. It is hard to re-establish the passion, dynamism and creativity that we would like to see in our schools once a cycle of dependency has been created.</p> <p>The second problem is that the views of those who take the big picture overview and many within the teaching profession are increasingly at odds with the government's emphasis on the basics. Clearly, we all agree that being literate, numerate and competent using a computer is important but it is clear that much is being sacrificed on the altar of the basics. </p> <p>There is now some recognition of this problem. However, whilst being exhorted to offer a more wide-ranging and enjoyable curriculum, schools continue to face the twin pressures of Ofsted and league tables with their focus on the high-status, high-stakes assessment. Therefore, we should not be surprised that this is what teachers spend most of their time on. This narrow, 'Gradgrind' educational experience does not sit comfortably with teachers' knowledge of the needs of their pupils and their views on the wider purposes of education.</p> <p>The third problem is that teachers are one of the targets to carry the blame for the perceived ills of society. Bad press doesn't help, although I don't suggest that the teaching profession should be above media criticism. Yet the sheer number of people involved, the subject matter and the fact that we all went to school and often have a romantic and rosy view of the past can make the reaction to negative stories in the press so dangerously emotional. There can be no doubt of the long-term damage this can do to individuals and the nation as a whole. </p> <p>Teachers are often blamed by sections of the press and parents for unruly children. Yet these are often the same parents who threaten teachers, verbally, physically or in court when they try to discipline their children. The reality is that children are in school for 17% of their time. They spend 33% in bed and this leaves 50% for their parents, peers and television. We all have our role to play and must all share the responsibility rather than divert attention from our failings by blaming others. In the relatively small amount of time they have teachers do an extraordinary job. </p> <p>We live in a noisy and challenging world. For the vast majority of children school is an oasis of calm order and purposeful learning. We cannot rush back to the past, nor should we want to. There was no golden age in education. We have seen huge social, economic and political change. In an information rich environment, with so many powerful influences we need to help our pupils to become discerning people. They need to be able to determine what is worth knowing, what is worth doing and which values are worth holding onto. These are the big questions. </p> <p>The good news is that the profession can make a difference, even as we deal with the current narrow measures of success. As a head you can determine a unique vision of your school. It is your answer to the big questions that ultimately defines the quality of the education you provide. Not the curriculum, nor assessment, but the values you hold.</p> <p>As a teacher you can make a difference. Everything we accept becomes acceptable. Everything we value becomes valuable. Everything we do with enthusiasm becomes inspiring. Everything we do grudgingly becomes a chore. When we are sensitive, we sensitise. When we are dismissive, we negate. Our lowest expectations are self-fulfilling. Our highest expectations become possible. As Ruskin said 'There is a striking quality to fine classrooms. Pupils are caught up in learning, excitement abounds and playfulness and seriousness blend easily because the purposes are clear, the goals sensible and an unmistakable feeling of well being prevails'.</p> <p>For me there is no greater mission than education. It is in our gift to create a success culture through a belief in the inherent skills and abilities of our pupils and our staff. If we truly value education then we must offer an alternative and positive vision of teaching. This is what the Teaching Awards Trust is all about. Our mission is to celebrate excellence and promote best practice. We consider teachers to be the greatest resource and asset in our schools and we are taking active steps to invest in them and so our future.</p>",
  "<p>Labour today dismissed Tory plans to give schools an extra \u00a35.7bn a year by slashing the number of civil servants, labelling their sums \"dodgy\" and accusing them of planning \"deep cuts\" to public services.</p> <p>The Conservative party's plans involve slashing 2,700 civil service posts and further cuts to the schools' inspectorate, Ofsted. The Tory plans mirror those already underway within the government following a review of the size of civil service by Sir Peter Gershon, albeit on a larger scale. </p> <p>Today the Conservatives claimed that they would free schools from excessive interference from central and local government and plough the savings into providing more teachers.</p> <p>The proposals, drawn up by former Millennium Dome chief, David James, would also see seven funds or quangos brought to an end, the Ofsted schools inspectorate streamlined and the role of local education authorities curtailed, with schools given extra freedom to run their own affairs. </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin said the Department for Education typified the \"fat and bloated bureaucracy\" created by Labour. </p> <p>\"These proposals will remove vast swathes of unnecessary government control over education spending and put large sums of extra cash in the front line where it belongs,\" he said. </p> <p>Chief secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme today that the Tories' plans for savings across government displayed a common thread, which was, he said, \"dodgy figures, smoke and mirrors\". </p> <p>Mr Boateng continued: \"What they seek to disguise, although they don't, is deep cuts in vital public services. </p> <p>\"The figures and the numbers simply don't add up. And whether you apply it, as they have over the summer, to Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), the civil service generally, and now the Department for Education and Skills, what you have is cuts, privatisation, the old Tory agenda.\" </p> <p>Mr Boateng went on: \"What we have done with the Gershon review is actually to put in place evidence-based analysis, led by Sir Peter Gershon, of the requirements of the public service. </p> <p>\"He has already identified, and Charles Clarke and the DfES (Department for Department for Education and Skills) have committed to, efficiency savings of 2.5% annually, leading to \u00a34.3bn to be saved within that department by 2007/8.\" </p> <p>The government announced in the spring budget statement that it is planning to shed 1,460 jobs at the Department for Education and Skills and a further 500 at Ofsted. </p> <p>The move was welcomed by teachers as it emerged that the cuts would largely come from the department's standards unit, which had been accused of adding to headteachers' workload by excessively monitoring progress in schools.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Tories conceded that the plans were similar to the government, but claimed they would be more effective. \"It's \u00a32bn more than Gershon's managed to find. We can do it better with more teachers,\" she said. </p> <p>Under the Tory plans, schools would also have more autonomy from local authorities, bringing further savings that the Liberal Democrats said would impact on the most needy children. Phil Willis MP, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for education, said: \"Local authorities are looking after children with special needs and are responsible for school transport. The Tories seem to see nothing wrong with cuttings in these two vital sectors. </p> <p>\"These proposals are recycled versions of William Hague's failed policies. They are bad news for pupils with special educational needs and bad news for families who rely on school transport.\"</p> <p>The Labour government has its own plans to allow schools to \"earn\" their autonomy from local authorities by proving that they can run as \"independent specialist\" schools.</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"We strongly support the principal of getting more of the education budget directly to schools, and for schools to have more autonomy, but this must be within a framework of collaboration. </p> <p>\"I think that we are already moving towards a different relationship between local authorities and schools in which more power is delegated to the schools themselves. I think that's the right way forward. But the DfES cannot run a system with 25,000 schools without some intermediate peer.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Equal Opportunities Commission called for a statutory code of practice last night to protect women during pregnancy, after finding evidence that many employers do not understand the complicated jigsaw of current law. </p> <p>Research from the shopworkers' union, Usdaw, established that two-thirds of its pregnant women members did not get a safety risk assessment, as required by law.</p> <p>They were commonly put on \"light duties\" at the checkout, oblivious to the fact that an average checkout operator has to lift more than a tonne of produce during a four-hour shift.</p> <p>The EOC's research found more than a quarter of employers cannot cite a single statutory entitlement for pregnant women.</p> <p>Its investigation of pregnancy discrimination sought to establish why about 1,000 women a year in England and Wales have to take legal action after being sacked because they were pregnant.</p> <p>Julie Mellor, the commission's chairwoman, said. \"Others face pay cuts, demotion, hostile treatment or are made to work in an unsafe environment.</p> <p>\"The impact on these women's lives and the health and safety of their baby can be disastrous.\"</p> <p>The research found 350,000 working women in Britain become pregnant in the course of each year. Businesses with fewer than 10 employees were likely to have a pregnant employee only one year in 10.</p> <p>Nearly a quarter of women who made an employment tribunal claim were dismissed within hours of telling their employer they were pregnant.</p> <p>One in five women who returned to work for the same employer after maternity leave were put on a lower grade or level of job.</p> <p>More than a third of employers felt that pregnancy was \"an undue cost burden on the organisation\". But some employers were unaware of their right to reclaim statutory maternity pay.</p> <p>The commission quoted examples of extreme unpleasantness from employers when told a member of staff was pregnant. One said: \"You silly girl. I had you marked down as a career woman.\"</p> <p>Another said: \"Have you considered an abortion? You aren't seriously thinking of keeping it, surely not? But you're not married.\"</p> <p>The EOC called for a written statement of rights to be given to every pregnant woman and her employer at her first antenatal visit, and an extension of the three-month time limit for filing pregnancy-related tribunal claims.</p>",

  "<p>Cash-strapped football clubs unable to find themselves a friendly Russian billionaire are embracing the mobile phone industry with open arms. The reason's simple: behind the logo-emblazoned football shirts lies a plethora of football-themed mobile services generating revenue for mobile phone company and football club alike. </p> <p>The starting point is a belief in the power of football as a social currency. Football fans love to talk about the beautiful game, and the latest news or incisive insight is highly prized. Mobile phone companies facing near market saturation are having to find new ways to win customers from rival networks, or extract more revenue from existing ones. They are on the look-out for communities of consumers rather than individuals because of the inevitable cost advantages of one-to-many over one-to-one communication. And as their global ambitions grow, they are eager to associate themselves with big clubs with an international following, too. </p> <p>At the same time, however, mobile phone companies are also using football to underline their positioning of the mobile phone as a legitimate medium in its own right. So, recent weeks have seen third generation (3G) mobile video network 3 trumpet the launch of its goals highlights from Barclays Premiership matches by 5.15pm on a Saturday - ahead of Match of the Day. On other match days, in both the Barclays Premiership and Uefa Champions League, highlights will be available just five minutes after the final whistle. </p> <p>3 is well ahead of the pack in video terms as, although Vodafone began rolling out its 3G service earlier this year, it has yet to offer its customers football-related video content. Rival networks, meanwhile, expect their 3G services to go live \"in the next few months\". However, while video-based content is widely regarded as the future, a broad range of SMS, MMS and other content services are available off the back of high-profile club sponsorships. </p> <p>Earlier this year 02 renewed its sponsorship of Arsenal for a further two years in a deal reportedly worth \u00a36m, to be not just the club's sponsor but \"digital partner\". Since July, Orange has struck three-year \"official mobile network\" partnerships with Chelsea and Manchester City - the first in a series of planned deals with a number of top UK clubs to generate exclusive content. </p> <p>Vodafone, meanwhile, has an on-going sponsorship and digital partnership with Manchester United. And T-Mobile now sponsors West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City and Aston Villa and is mobile phone partner to each; it also has mobile phone partnerships with Celtic, Rangers, Charlton Athletic and Southampton. </p> <p>In each case, mobile phone networks are developing a portfolio of paid-for, value-added services for football fans. These range from standard downloads such as ringtones and wallpaper to text alerts and exclusive player or manager interviews. Some are only available to subscribers, others on a pay-as-you-go basis. And as more and more rival services launch, the emphasis now is on segmentation - offering different bundles of content to different fans. </p> <p>For the time being only 02 makes its mobile football services available to users of any network: rival networks cater only for their own customers. In the light of this and the fact that it struck that its first digital partnership with Arsenal back in 2002, 02 sees itself as a pioneer in this emerging new media market. </p> <p>\"It has been an extremely successful venture for us so far,\" insists Paul Samuels, 02's head of sponsorship and interactive partnerships, despite demurring when asked to quantify \"success\" in exact revenue terms. \"At launch we believed the key would be timely and exclusive content and this is still the case today. Mobile is now the first place many people choose to get their football news.\" </p> <p>For this season 02 is starting to segment its football content services to boost their appeal and relevance amongst different groups of Arsenal fans. It has also introduced a range of personalised downloads. And as the sophistication of handsets grows, richer content is becoming more widely available. </p> <p>\"As Wap and video become more prevalent, and with the arrival of 3G, mobile phones will become a true medium in their own right - as legitimate a media channel as newspapers or TV,\" Samuels says. \"3G is the final destination and the key to succeeding with it will be more and more immediate, relevant and exclusive content.\" </p> <p>Both Orange and T-Mobile are also moving towards tailoring mobile football content for different groups of fans. \"Personalisation is a growing priority,\" says Orange's director of multimedia, Mark Hird, who is looking to strike strategic partnerships with a number of football clubs. Another priority is evolving the style and sophistication of content as more advanced mobile phone handsets become more widely available. </p> <p>\"Our aim off the back of every sponsorship - be it sports, music or arts-related - is to create interactive experiences for our customers,\" he adds. \"Our football services are already amongst our most successful content services. Our aim is to create something complementary to other media that maximises the potential of mobile.\" </p> <p>Vodafone, meanwhile, is pursuing a slightly different agenda. With a greater global presence than its rivals in the UK, the company recently extended its sponsorship of Manchester United for another four years in the hope of exploiting the club's powerful brand internationally. Vodafone will shortly roll out Manchester United mobile content to customers in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Ireland. </p> <p>\"The driving force behind this isn't just generating additional revenue through mobile phone content,\" insists Maria Bellanca, head of PR for Vodafone's group sports sponsorship. \"It's about a range of mutual benefits for the club and for ourselves. It's about exclusivity on both sides - enabling Manchester United fans to access the latest technology and exclusive content. And it's about one major global brand endorsing another.\" </p> <p>With most of the larger football clubs in England signed to a mobile phone network eager to develop their digital mobile rights, the race is on to create increasingly sophisticated and appealing mobile content. The biggest challenge, however, will be deciding just which services to develop as technology advances. </p> <p>\"For the time being, standard services such as text alerts and ringtones are the most popular amongst T-Mobile customers,\" says David Grint, head of marketing communications at T-Mobile which, like Orange, is building a portfolio of club partnerships. \"Given the access we now have to exclusive content, the range of services we could now develop is virtually infinite. The trick, however, will be to identify what fans and clubs most want.\" </p> <p>It's the $64m question, of course, and just how well these mobile phone companies have positioned themselves in the run-up to launching 3G services remains to be seen. For, according to Gareth Jones, chief operating officer of 3 which, with Vodafone, holds exclusive video rights to Premier League matches for the next three years, their emphasis on one club sponsorships and exclusive partnerships may well prove ill-founded. </p> <p>\"What we've learned over the last 12 months is that customers don't want magazine-style mobile content but intensive content to fill small, compressed periods during the day,\" he says. \"Success in the future 3G market won't be about huge, big ticket club sponsorship deals but fresh new content updated frequently - something some may struggle to do if they are locked in to one club.\" </p> <p>The coming months will show just who is right.</p>",
  "<p>A Californian man has been arrested for allegedly using global positioning system technology to stalk a former girlfriend. </p> <p>Ara Gabrielyan is said to have attached a mobile phone with the tracking system to the woman's car, allowing him to follow her movements. </p> <p>The unidentified woman said he had turned up unexpectedly while she was having coffee at a bookshop, picking up a friend from the airport, visiting her brother's grave and at dozens of other places. </p> <p>\"This is what I would call stalking of the 21st century,\" said a police spokesman . </p> <p>Mr Gabrielyan, 32, from Glendale, is said to have phoned the woman 30 to 100 times a day after she ended their two-year relationship six months ago. </p> <p>She called the police and had him arrested after seeing him underneath her car, changing the phone's battery. </p> <p>The phone, which had a motion switch that turned on when the car moved, sent a signal to a satellite, allowing Mr Gabrielyan to track her movements on the internet. </p> <p>He is being held on $500,000 (\u00a3280,000) bail and faces up to six years in prison. </p> <p>The police spokesman said: \"It was an obsession, an obsession to the point where 24-hours a day he had to know where she was, what she did, who she met and how she carried out her daily routine.\"</p>",

  "<p>Robert, Kay and Alan are three \"ordinary\" people, which means they're not politicians. One is boss of a communications company, the next is managing director of a design agency and the third a business development advisor. But in <strong>Crisis Command: Could You Run the Country?</strong> (BBC2, Sunday) they're handed the reins of government for a simulated national emergency. On hand to help are \"three genuine experts\", one of whom is Amanda Platell. She, of course, was William Hague's spin doctor, so she knows a thing or two about dealing with a crisis. </p> <p>There has been an outbreak of deadly plague in Liverpool and our amateur cabinet has to make snap decisions - about how much of the city to seal off, about whether to deploy the army, about whether to release an untested vaccine - in order to stop it turning into a major national, even international, catastrophe. Gavin Hewitt, who presents the show, heaps on the pressure, urging them to hurry up because this is not just a debate - they are dealing with people's lives. </p> <p>But Robert, Kay and Alan do brilliantly. They think things through, argue it all out, and more often than not they make the right decision, in spite of some rotten advice from Amanda Platell. A global pandemic is averted. </p> <p>It makes you wonder where we would be if Robert, Kay and Alan had been really running the country for the past 18 months or so. Here are all the intelligence reports, here are some military experts to say what kind of war it will be and how long it will last, here are your PR experts to say how it will all go down, now should we? Or not? </p> <p>I like this show, but I'd like to see a parallel project, a programme called Could You Do a Real Job? Real job could mean traffic warden, shelf stacker and nappy changer and the first three contestants could be, for example, called Tony, Gordon and Jack. While they were filming, the reins - the real ones, not the makey-uppy ones - could be handed to Robert, Kay and Alan. And then, if we liked what they did, we could make their positions permanent - vote them in, just by hitting the red button on the remote control. </p> <p>Or the country could just be handed over to Nicky Clarke to run. Because the way to the roots of a nation's problems is through its hair. Well, that's what you might think from watching <strong>Storyville: The Beauty Academy of Kabul</strong> (BBC2, Saturday). </p> <p>A bunch of well-intentioned American women open up the first hair and beauty school in the Afghan capital, as a sort of two-fingered salute to some of the country's archaic practices, and in particular to the old Taliban regime. It's like The Salon, but moved to Kabul. No, that's not fair. This, as Storyville documentaries always are, is a classy film - beautifully shot and understated, with none of that unnecessary narration nonsense. </p> <p>My problem was that I found the well-meaning Americans so ghastly. \"All those who have makeup on stand up!\" shouts the loudest of them, to a class of Afghan women, most of whom don't stand up. They aren't wearing any makeup and look lovely. The American is and doesn't. </p> <p>\"Why aren't the rest of them wearing makeup?\" she demands, to the translator. \"You know what, you're stuck in a rut, guys,\" she yells at them. \"You're stuck in a hole of the past that you can't get out of, and my God, before I leave here you're getting out of the hole.\" It's interesting she feels in a position to lecture these lovely women about beauty. </p> <p><strong>Quite Ugly One Morning</strong> (ITV1, Sunday), a black comedy starring Yellow Pages actor James Nesbitt, was a giggle. It started promisingly, with Nesbitt walking in on his doctor neighbour's flat to find him not just with his throat slit but with two of his fingers cut off and rammed up his nostrils. Plus a turd on the sideboard. And that's the sort of vein it carried on in - more death (human and canine), more damage to fingers, plenty of laughs, an implausibly young and attractive detective sergeant and an equally implausible but charming plot involving, as well as murder, the evils of NHS privatisation. </p> <p>But Jimmy, you're going to have to cut back on the Yellow Pages ads. I kept thinking you were going to turn up at the police station and say, \"Some eeejit's cut my neighbour's throat!\"</p>",
  "<p>It felt as though China had broken its Olympic promises on day one. In securing the bid for Beijing to host the 2008 games, the city's representatives pledged that the world media would enjoy full freedom to report all aspects of China. </p> <p>Yet less than 24 hours after the Olympic flag was handed to Beijing's mayor last Sunday, there I was - the Guardian's China correspondent - detained and harassed for covering a peaceful demonstration that challenged the government's position on Tibet. </p> <p>My press pass was confiscated, and I was led away for questioning, accused of conducting an \"illegal interview\". My colleague - Sami Sillanpaa, a Finnish journalist - had the memory card of his camera seized, erased and made permanently unusable. </p> <p>Our interrogator told me he was in charge of foreign media and had the power to decide whether our visas would be renewed. He then accused us of \"serious offences\". The implication was clear: \"Do as I say or you could be kicked out of the country.\" There was no physical abuse, but it was intimidation, pure and simple. </p> <p>Our offence was to have photographed and talked to two Tibetan rights activists - an American and an Australian - who unfurled a large red banner, close to the site of the 2008 games, proclaiming \"No Olympics for China until Tibet is Free\". </p> <p>It was hardly earth-shattering news. Chinese passers-by barely registered what was going on because the slogan was in English. When the protesters rolled up their banner and walked off after an uneventful five minutes, most of the dozen or so journalists present dismissed the stunt as something far too dull to report. </p> <p>But the police came to the publicity-seekers' rescue just as everyone was heading home. By detaining them and the two of us for questioning, a non-story became news around the world. </p> <p>My experience is typical of the treatment of journalists in China. Most Beijing correspondents have been held for questioning at least once. Some veterans claim more than a dozen detentions. </p> <p>Domestic reporters face far worse. Earlier this year, two editors of the Southern Metropolitan Daily were imprisoned in a clear case of retribution by the local authorities in Guangdong province. They were embarrassed by the paper's revelations about the Sars cover-up, police beatings and official corruption. </p> <p>To China's shame, such abuses are a hangover from the old authoritarian system, large parts of which have been untouched by the momentous changes that elsewhere have modernised the economy and brought the Olympics to Beijing. </p> <p> It was not supposed to be like this. Back in 2001, when Beijing was chosen as host for the 2008 games, the International Olympic Committee admitted its greatest concern was China's human rights record. But Jacques Rogge, the IOC president, expressed confidence that the spotlight of the games would bring improvements. </p> <p>So far, the record is patchy at best. Compared with a decade ago, fewer foreign journalists have been deported and restrictions on movement have been relaxed. But the police can still detain us at whim, as I found out on Monday. </p> <p>When I asked about my \"offence\", my interrogator told me I had conducted an interview without getting prior permission. Never mind that the \"interview\" in question was with two foreigners that I bumped into on the street, this was against the regulations. It is absurd. How can a journalist operate freely under such conditions? </p> <p>According to Reporters Without Borders, China has one of the world's worst records on media repression, with 27 journalists and 60 internet dissidents currently under arrest. If Beijing is to fulfil its Olympic promise to the world, this problem must be cleared up. </p> <p>The good news is that there is the time and incentive to make a change. China is developing so quickly that anything is possible. Progressives in the government - thought to include the prime minister, Wen Jiabao - realise the media must be a watchdog rather than just a propaganda tool if the rampant problem of corruption is to be tamed. </p> <p>And there has never been a better opportunity to push for change than the Olympics. China is treating the games as a \"coming of age\" party for a fast-growing country that has overcome the chaos of the cultural revolution to reclaim its place as a leading player on the global stage. </p> <p>But all the gold and the glory will be tarnished if basic rights - including free speech - are lacking. The Guardian will protest at my detention to the Chinese government, the IOC and the Vienna-based International Press Institute. Hopefully, it will prove, as these things often are, an unfortunate misunderstanding. Under the current rules, it is unlikely to be the last, but with the global spotlight now on China, such clumsy harassment ought to be made a thing of the past. Privately, government officials admit more transparency and greater press freedom are desirable. \"Just give us time,\" they say. With four years until the Olympics, the countdown has started. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.watts@ theguardian.com\">jonathan.watts@ theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>If you're a bloke, you won't remember much about the Mitsubishi Colt ad, except perhaps that the car is driven by a steamy 20-something blonde. If you're female you'll have noted how irritatingly tiny this \"more than just a pretty face\" of a car is, that the woman is driving it underwater, that three men in white lab coats are watching her through the aquarium glass and they are grinning like hell. </p> <p>Why? Because she's top totty? Because they are pleased with the car's performance? It is ambiguous. Either way, you'll probably feel irked and patronised. </p> <p>The Yellow Pages ad featuring a hapless James Nesbitt incapable of sorting out his life on his own is also irritating. It stereotypes men as incompetent, which is not a message women especially want to be peddled. Because if men are incompetent, women end up running the show, which is presumably why the Bounty kitchen paper ad features a man in drag. Real men don't, or can't, clean floors. </p> <p>Strange, then, that marketing analysts would have us believe we now live in a golden age of androgyny. Gender roles, they say, are fluid, blurred. Targeting men and women as separate species, one lot from Mars, the other from Venus, is, they say, as over as 80s shoulder pads or 90s ladettes. So why do so many ads try to speak to women as if they are a sisterhood of Stepford wives? Why do advertisers think that women only drive small cars? Do they really think that they buy things, such as Gillette's Venus razor, because they are pink? Nearly 50% of women dislike how they are portrayed in advertising, according to the Future Foundation, compared with 37% of men. Surprise, surprise. </p> <p>Next month, Rethink Pink, the UK's first annual conference looking at the female consumer, is being held in London. The aim is to steer industry insiders away from lame stereotypes and towards a sharper understanding of both our shifting cultural values and the modern female consumer in all her complex glory. Only then will they win her loyalty, and a market share of her increasing spending power. </p> <p>\"Adding just a splash of pink to your products and marketing material is not the way to go in targeting what is a highly educated and sophisticated audience,\" says Peter Frost of Rethink Pink. Women, according to Frost, influence over 85% of global consumer decision-making, purchase over 50% of new vehicles, comprise 40% of business travellers and start 35% of new businesses. </p> <p>\"The zeitgeist has completely changed,\" says Caroline Whitehall, director of research and strategy consultancy Acacia Avenue. \"Traditional business has been about male values. Women as well as men have endorsed that. In the 90s everyone talked about the crisis of masculinity. We are post that. We no longer live in a masculine or feminine society. </p> <p>\"There are now a lot of feminine cues being used in business and therefore becoming endorsed by business. BT's It's Good to Talk campaign in 1994 marked a shift towards this endorsement of female values, says Whitehall. \"Society frowns on small talk, on female chatter. Big talk, what men do, is fighting talk. It means something. To get men, as well as women, to talk on the phone you need to endorse small talk. And that's what the campaign did.\" </p> <p>The market research consultancy Breaking Trends talks about the feminisation of the global village, from the boardroom to the bedroom and the marketplace. Feminine values are no longer marginalised; instead they are centre stage. Whitehall agrees: \"Think of the Egg campaign, with its soft, simple, feminine values,\" she says, \"compared to male-style companies like Lloyds TSB with its logo of a black horse. It's powerful, bold, masculine.\" And rather old-fashioned. </p> <p>\"You couldn't get a better example of our acceptance of female values than Nadia in Big Brother,\" says Whitehall. \"She is loved by the nation. If that's not an indicator of the shift that's going on then I don't know what is.\" </p> <p>Advertising, meanwhile, is in danger of looking like a cross between Pollyanna and PC Plod: fuddy-duddy, out of touch and reliant on gender stereotypes. \"It is time to catch up,\" says Jonathan Mildenhall, managing director of TBWA in London, whose campaigns include French Connection, Wonderbra, the Labour party and Whiskas. </p> <p>\"Otherwise advertising will get left behind. Broadcasters and media owners are giving a much more accurate reflection of the multifaceted lives of women today. Look at Channel 4 programming or the content of Heat, of Glamour and Cosmopolitan versus ads on TV or in the press. The editorial and broadcast content is much more real. Ads always fall back to comfortable stereotypes. But today's women can't be pigeonholed. </p> <p>\"A 35- or 45-year-old woman today is buying the same clothes as her daughters. She's buying a cookbook for her own diet, not her husband's dinner. She is reading magazines that have intimate, explicit content. She is watching shows like Sex and the City. </p> <p>\"But the advertising that sandwiches all of this is really bland. It tries to package her up as a housewife. The idea of marketing to women as a single homogenous group is as archaic as marketing to white men. </p> <p>\"We need to be much more sensitive to our attitudinal marketing, to be cleverer and braver in what we portray in advertising so it doesn't continue to play a passive role in between the editorial or TV content in between. We need to be braver.\" </p> <p>That bravery can misfire. Pampers has just launched its first ad featuring a man in sole charge of a baby. Very touching. But note that the dad does not actually change a nappy. He's just in the same room as the baby. The very fact that this ad is seen by Procter &amp; Gamble as a radical departure surely shows how advertising is one step behind reality. </p> <p>\"We have dared to show a man,\" says Pampers brand manager David Jones. \"A few years ago Pampers ads would feature men in white jackets. The aim of this ad is to put Pampers in a relevant situation; 64.5% of women are now working. There are times in the day, especially at the end of the day, when the man has to change that nappy. That's something that actually happens. </p> <p>\"In terms of a communication message, if we were to be talking exclusively about a mother and baby, we would not be reflecting what is going on out there.\" </p> <p>The ad does not, he says, expect men to go out and buy the nappies. \"We would not make that leap. In terms of who is going into the supermarket and making the purchases, it's largely the mother.\" </p> <p>So much for the new androgyny. \"Women still control the majority of brand shopping,\" says William Nelson of the Future Foundation. \"Not that much has changed. You still need to target women.\" </p> <p>They are responsible for grocery shopping in 47% of couples, according to a British Household Panel Study. When men do go off to the supermarket, 21% of them are armed with a list - written by the woman. Patronise her at your peril. </p> <p>It is the \"female prosumer\", or professional consumer, says Glenda Stone, CEO of Aurora, which analyses women's work, spending and investment patterns, who is the most misunderstood. </p> <p>\"The female prosumer is hugely economically discerning. She is a well-informed, independent spender. She is making purchasing decisions all day long, from the tissues she is buying on the way to work to where she will spend her Nasdaq millions. </p> <p>\"The power of the purse has risen significantly. Her marriage spend is even greater than her individual spend. It's not the guys who buy the ties. The marketplace has been sleepy in terms of marketing to women as one generic homogenous group. They've walloped them together into a single aggregate. But women are all different,\" she says, adding that 200,000 of them now own small businesses. </p> <p>Like Stone herself, many may own a Porsche, not a Mini Cooper. Stone doesn't buy into the idea of a brave new androgynous culture. Marketing to men and women as if they spoke the same language won't work. \"It does depend on the product, but women want to be treated specially, and to be understood.\" </p> <p>The male psyche, on the other hand, is sewn up, says TBWA's Jonathan Mildenhall. \"We get it right with men so many times. That's because we are braver. We have a fat northern man telling jokes,\" he says, referring to the John Smith campaign featuring comedian Peter Kay. \"Men relate to it. We have so many wine and beer brands targeting women, but we adopt saccharine stereotypes. </p> <p>\"It is not politically correct to capitalise on the difference between men and women. They are marked 'Handle With Care': we don't want to offend them so we bland down when we target women and end up producing vanilla advertising. It's a huge missed opportunity.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Rethink Pink takes place on October 13. For details see <a href=\"http://www.rethinkpink.com\">www.rethinkpink.com</a></p>",
  "The first muted criticisms of Russia's handling of the siege - and the protracted Chechen crisis - emerged at the weekend amid outpourings of humanitarian sympathy. <p>The Dutch government, which holds the European Union presidency, asked the Russian authorities to explain \"how this tragedy could have happened\". Diplomats at Valkenburg in the Nether lands, where EU ministers met, said Latvia, the former Soviet republic, had also pressed other states to react more strongly to Russia's conduct of the security operation. </p> <p>In London, the Conservative foreign affairs spokesman, Michael Ancram, cautioned about the danger of pursuing \"military solutions internally\" and urged President Vladimir Putin to refrain from launching a backlash against the Islamic community in the region. </p> <p>For many politicians and commentators, the massacre served to reinforce international alliance and extend battle lines in the war against terrorism. In the Arab world, the atrocity was widely perceived as discrediting the cause of Chechen independence and Islamism. </p> <p>Russia denounced the request by Bernard Bot, the Dutch foreign minister, for an explanation for the bloody end to the hostage seizure. \"In a situation when the whole world knew that the main priority was saving children, and that there would be no storming, to hear such words from a minister seems to us to be blasphemy,\" Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said. </p> <p>The Dutch ambassador in Moscow was summoned to the foreign ministry on Saturday to clarify Mr Bot's remarks. Mr Bot insisted he had been misunderstood and said he would try to calm the row by talking to his Russian counterpart. After the same meeting, the Swedish foreign minister, Laila Freivalds, said she understood the Russian reaction, while the Irish foreign minister, Brian Cowen, said it would be \"a very premature and wrong judgment\" to fault the Russian security forces. </p> <p>Italy's foreign minister, Franco Frattino, spoke for many when he said: \"We understand the tragic dilemma in which Russia found itself. Nobody in Europe has ever doubted, and nobody does in Italy, that, in such a tragic moment, to our Russian friends we should only express solidarity and outrage at terrorism, which has caused these innocent deaths.\" </p> <p>In the past, Russia has accused European governments of hypocrisy for pursuing the war against terrorism while criticising Russia's human rights record in Chechnya. Mr Putin has characterised his southern war as another front in the fight against international terrorism. </p> <p>Russian officials allege that EU states are sheltering Chechen warlords. Last year they failed to extradite Akhmed Zakayev, a London-based envoy for the Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov. Moscow has also been critical of Scandinavian states deemed to be sympathetic to the Chechen cause. </p> <p>In the US, news of the death toll prompted President George Bush to call it \"another grim reminder of the length to which terrorists will go to threaten this civilised world\". </p> <p>The president's spokesman, Scott McClellan, later added: \"The responsibility for the tragic loss of life rests with the terrorists. The United States stands side by side with Russia in our global fight against terrorism.\" </p> <p>France, which, like Russia, opposed the war in Iraq, offered practical support and political backing. \"In the face of this terrible terrorist drama, I want to convey my emotion and to express the solidarity of France with the Russian people,\" President Jacques Chirac said in a letter to Mr Putin. </p> <p>In the Arab world, there was similar outrage. \"What happened at the ill-fated school is not only unjustifiable and unacceptable,\" Jordan's Al-Dustur newspaper said. \"It also provokes anger and revulsion among Muslim public opinion, since it tarnishes the name of all Muslims and distorts the image of our noble faith.\"</p>",
  "<p>One measure of the passage of time since the September 11 atrocities is the shifting tone of the anniversary coverage. While post-Diana programmes have reduced in number over the years, 9/11 television has multiplied - because the global consequences were so much greater - but has also become tougher. </p> <p>Last week's The Hamburg Cell (daringly entering the minds of the hijackers) would have been an impossible commission for the first or second anniversaries, and Channel 4's The 9/11 Conspiracies feels like another show which has only become permissable 36 months after the event. </p> <p>Documentaries about conspiracy theories - or \"counter-histories\", as some adherents prefer - are common on television but generally address questions of only distant sensitivity. </p> <p>The allegation that the Apollo moonlandings were tricked up in an Arizona film studio irritates former astronauts and NASA officials but can be watched by most viewers with a smile. And the various theories that Princess Diana was murdered or is riding Shergar on a desert island as Elvis and Lord Lucan look on, though painful for her immediate family, are actually comforting for her fans who prefer them to the savage lottery of a car crash. </p> <p>The alternative hypotheses for September 11, however, have more in common with Holocaust denial: you gasp that people can be so dismissive of body-counts and substantial documentation. </p> <p>George W Bush and Dick Cheney stood down America's air defences in order to allow an attack which would green-light the neo-cons' plans to hit Iraq. It was not a hijacked plane which hit the Pentagon but an American missile intended to fake damage: the jet was flown to a secret location where pilots and passengers now live. </p> <p>Most of these flights of fantasy are piloted by a theology professor who looks confusingly exactly like Dick Cheney, although former British minister Michael Meacher gives cautious support to some of them. The programme carefully takes apart each of these speculations. It concludes that America's air defences were lax because the nation lost its sense of vulnerability after the cold war. The sister of the pilot of the Pentagon plane explains with commendable calmness that he really wasn't the kind of guy to disappear to fake his death to play volleyball on a secret Hawaiian island with Princess Diana. </p> <p>At first, the documentary's response to these wacky narratives feels disproportionate: like Inspector Morse and Hercule Poirot reopening the Humpty Dumpty case. But then you understand that conspiracy theorists need to be met with their own obsessive solemnity. </p> <p>And, to be fair to the counter-historians, as the film is, the documentary touches on genuine miscarriages of official history. One, though already well-covered in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, is the evacuation of prominent Saudis from the States in the days after the attacks; the other is the presence in Manhattan of a van-load of young Israelis who may have been agents. </p> <p>But, apart from a casual reference to support for conspiracy theories rising as belief in politicians falls, the film is annoyingly short on context. Most of the anti-factual narratives about 9/11 result from a fact of contemporary politics: the belief of many people that the Bush-Cheney adminstration and/or the Israeli government are capable of almost anything. Crucially, the spread of 9/11 conspiracy theories became an industry not after 9/11 but following the Iraq war. </p> <p>In the same way, the internet fantasies about the moon landings are partly driven by the fact that Richard Nixon, the most divisive president until George W Bush, was in the White House at the time. And the belief that aliens landed at Roswell in New Mexico in 1946 - now an almost mainstream opinion in some parts of America - was oxygenated by the shock of Pearl Harbor and the invasion fears produced by the cold war. </p> <p>While alternative histories set themselves against the recorded story, they in fact have a symbiotic relationship with it. Only half of the interest in conspiracy theories is to do with whether they are true; the other fascination is why people believe them. Thorough and responsible on the first question, the programme more or less shrugs away the second. </p> <p>And, if you were the TV critic for al-Qaida, you would note from this programme that a) the cultural shock from 9/11 is receding in the west and b) a lot of those people distrust their leaders to a remarkable degree. </p> <p><strong>A waking nightmare</strong></p> <p>Inevitably most of the anniversary programmes look back, so The Grid, BBC2's three-part drama, is unusual among 9/11-inspired programmes in being futuristic. This US-UK co-production imagines Islamic terrorist cells in Britain, Africa and America plotting to top their signature atrocity. </p> <p>In subject-matter - fact-based speculation on al-Qaida - it's tempting to describe The Grid as a companion piece to The Hamburg Cell, except that they would disagree over almost everything. Where The Hamburg Cell was a responsible reconstruction from documentary sources, The Grid is a lurid fiction, in which a gas attack on a London hotel leads to panic on three continents. </p> <p>Seeking realism, The Grid uses the grammar of factual television: when a new character enters the room, the screen freezes and their name and job-title is typed on the screen. Regrettably, this borrowing from documentary is undermined by writing and acting which seem to aim for the opposite of naturalism. </p> <p>In a piece in which the different nationalities of the characters matter so much, it's unfortunate that much of the script is written in no recognisable language. Jemma Redgrave is required to say at one point: \"I'm sorry. I've also experienced anxiety about loved ones missing in action.\" </p> <p>Despite the lumpen script, there is one recurrent verbal pleasure in the scenes between British and American actors. Local pronounciation means that UK and US agents always seem to be subtly correcting each other, when discussing Kosovo or Iraq: you say Koss-ov-oh, I say Koe-so-vo, you eye-raq, I say ir-rarque, let's call the whole thing off. With so much stress on where the stresses fall, it's no surprise that an American character listed in the credits with the exotic name Canary pronounces it Cannery. </p> <p>Apart from these linguistic stand-offs, the security services are consistently depicted as being better at fighting each other than at confronting the enemy: in London, MI5 and MI6 bicker, while the FBI and NSC argue in Washington. </p> <p>These turf-wars are the strongest aspect of the series, but perhaps we shouldn't be surprised: US-UK co-productions know all about different factions with divergent agendas. Though watchable enough as a kind of Diet-24, The Grid visibly suffers from the trans-atlantic tensions it also portrays.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The 9/11 Conspiracies, Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Grid, Tuesday-Thursday, 9pm, BBC2</p>",
  "<p>Each time that Guinness releases a new campaign it faces the same old danger: that the public will start to regard its advertising in the fateful, dangerous way that they once regarded poor old Punch magazine - never as good as it used to be. </p> <p>The stout, around since 1759 and one of the world's oldest brands, is experiencing tough times. Sales are down 3% in Britain and 6% in Ireland. The previous Guinness advert in February that featured thousands of computer-generated moths was condemned by many in the advertising industry. </p> <p>Guinness is gambling that all will change come Wednesday, when it releases a 60-second television ad made by Anthony Minghella, the Oscar-winning director of The English Patient and Cold Mountain. At a time when TV advertising is regarded as having diminishing influence, the campaign budget of \u00a315m is quite simply a fortune. Saab's media spend for all of last year, in contrast, was \u00a321m. </p> <p>Advertising is all about sales, but with a \u00a315m ad spend plus the contribution of Minghella, Guinness's new blockbuster is also about marketing itself to the marketing industry and to its rivals. </p> <p>Minghella's ad, titled Mustang, is stunning and epic. But it is also deadly serious and very American. There is not a jot of quirkiness, which was for so long a Guinness mainstay. Mustang is a great piece of film, but the advertising industry will have a huge debate over whether or not it is a great advert for Guinness. </p> <p>Mustang, made with Abbot Mead Vickers BBDO, Britain's biggest advertising agency, opens in a gritty urban landscape where prisoners are transported to a prairie and charged with taming wild mustangs. Most use violence and fail. But the \"Guinness\" prisoner frees his horse in order to win the animal's trust. </p> <p>As the prisoner, wearing a white vest, approaches the black horse, Minghella merges this with the \"surge and settle\" that occurs when Guinness is poured into a glass and waits for it to assume its familiar black and white form. \"A story of darkness and light\", the caption says. Finally, the man rides the horse across a prairie that evokes the familiar light and darkness of a glass of Guinness. One member of the marketing team at Diageo, the global drinks giant that owns Guinness, said watching the advert gave her \"shivers\". </p> <p>The brand will hope Minghella's work gets a better reception than its previous effort, Moth. Caroline Marshall, whose columns for Campaign, the trade publication, and the Daily Telegraph make her an influential advertising commentator, was dismissive. \"Guinness and advertising, once the closest of couples, are going through a rough patch,\" she wrote. </p> <p>Many people still ponder what the advert, which featured a group of people being led through the jungle by moths to a bar, was all about. Guinness's core values of inner strength and self-belief, answers Nick Robinson, the marketing director of Guinness UK. \"The main character got his friends through the jungle and to the bar.\" </p> <p>Robinson says his advertising strategy is all about an emotional connection. He wants the adverts to make drinkers feel closer to the brand and more disposed to buying it. Robinson also regards the \"surge and settle\" moment as crucial, it makes Guinness stand out. Moth contained a similar \"surge and settle\" moment. \"Out of the clouds of black a white crown appears at the top of the pint and I think the advertisement does that really well,\" Robinson says. Despite the mixed reception, Robinson says Moth worked. Guinness sales rose 1.3% from December to May, he says, quoting figures from the research company AC Nielsen, while volume sales of all beer fell 0.8%. But that was not enough to counteract Guinness's year-on-year sales slump of 3%. </p> <p>In one way Guinness is caught in a trap it set by its own brilliance. If the punters expect a great advert and do not get it, Guinness will suffer in the public eye even if sales are good. And in advertising, brand perception is everything. Its classic talking toucan told us \"Guinness is good for you\" while the brand has been advertising on screen from the first night of commercial television. Rutger Hauer's Man with Guinness appeared in 1987. Anticipation, the dancing man with the music we can all still hum, appeared in 1994. \"Good things come to those who wait\" first appeared in 1998. The famous Surfer advert, with wild horses surging out of waves, appeared in 2000. Surfer ran for 18 months and won a Sunday Times/Channel 4 poll as the best TV advert. </p> <p>In the past few years, Guinness has moved swiftly through slogans: \"Good things come to those who wait\" became \"Believe\" in 2002 and then \"Out of the darkness comes light\" this year. Mustang is now \"A story of darkness and light\". </p> <p>\"My personal feeling was that the Anticipation campaign went badly off the rails when it got into snail racing and I just didn't understand Moth,\" says an advertising consultant who formerly worked on Guinness and declined to be named. \"I think they have over-intellectualised the advertising.\" </p> <p>Guinness's reputation for iconic advertising has always dwarfed its strength in the marketplace. In volume sales, Guinness lies in 5th place with 5% of the market, behind Carling, Fosters, Stella Artois and Carlsberg, according to the latest data from AC Nielsen, supplied by Diageo. But in off-licence sales last year Guinness fell out of the top ten, from 5th place to 11th. </p> <p>Globally, Guinness is going well, thanks in part to the Irish pubs boom. The stout's three biggest markets are the UK, Ireland and Nigeria. John Power, the Guinness advertising character in Africa, was so popular there that he starred in his own feature film. Volumes in Africa grew by 2%; Nigeria is tipped to be its biggest market by the time of the brand's 250th anniversary in 2009. Guinness has, however, dropped off the global list of the 100 most valuable brands complied by Interbrand. It made its last appearance in 2001, when it was valued at \u00a31.36bn. </p> <p>Guinness's heritage means that it continues with blockbuster TV campaigns in an era where they are becoming less important. Roisin Donnelly, the head of UK marketing at Procter &amp; Gamble, thinks young people don't believe in television as much anymore. And with 200 television channels, it is a lot harder to reach drinkers, doubly so due to the introduction of personal video recorders, such as Sky Plus, that allow people to skip adverts altogether. </p> <p>Last month Guinness moved its global marketing team from London back to Ireland. The rumours that Diageo would sell the brand, or put the Guinness advertising account up for pitch, have subsided. If Mustang proves to be a cracker and sales increase, there will be smiles all around and Guinness will be able to prove the strength of its slogan - \"out of the darkness comes light\".</p>",
  "<p>This has been the summer of the sickie as employers announced tighter management of sick leave. York council became the first public authority to adopt an absence management scheme. </p> <p>Consultancies in this field, well established in the private sector, have had their eyes on the public sector for some time. It is well known that the whole public sector has always had much higher rates of absenteeism than private business. </p> <p>Absence is monitored to differentiate those employees who take the odd duvet day from those who can't face Mondays due to more serious condition, such as chronic depression. Nurses are then introduced as independent counsellors. </p> <p>It is argued that, among other things, high absenteeism is bad for employee health, and that many of the genuine stress-related illnesses found in the public sector have their roots in an anarchic sickie culture which leaves those in the office struggling to cover for those who aren't. </p> <p>This is a difficult case to make because employees, even more than employers, seem readier to believe that colleagues are constantly trying to take advantage of their bosses, rather than accept that bad working environments make people ill. </p> <p>But the fact remains that workplaces where employees have control over their environments have lower absenteeism rates, and that the ultimate responsibility for the environment rests with the employer. </p> <p>Pauline Crawford, a sociologist with her own consultancy, Corporate Heart, warns that many employers recklessly overestimate the emotional well-being of their employees, to the point where they risk legal action. </p> <p>The connection to a bad atmosphere and bad health may seem nebulous now, but until recently, so did the connection between office furniture and tenosynovitis - inflammation of the tendons. However the courts now recognise repetitive strain injury as a real illness, as many employers (mostly in the public sector) have found to their cost.</p>",
  "<p>Graphic designer Anna Richards resigned from her last job because of the smell. \"It was a very young, trendy office and it was also quite small, so when you walked in in the morning you'd be hit by this cocktail of chemical smells - perfume, deodorant, shampoo, aftershave,\" she says. \"Then somebody would start leafing through a magazine with a free perfume sampler, just to add to the cloud. I'd have a headache by 10am. On bad days my eyes would itch and I'd feel sick for hours on end.\" </p> <p>She quit because there was nothing else she felt she could do. \"You can't stop people wearing deodorant if they want to, and how unpopular would you be in your office if you tried? It's my problem, and it was up to me to deal with it.\" </p> <p>But that might not be the case for too much longer. Increasingly, chemicals in cosmetics, fragrances and cleaners are being blamed for a range of common office maladies, from headaches and dizziness to lethargy and loss of concentration. Many experts believe that fragrance-sensitivity could become as big and divisive an issue in offices as smoking was in the '80s and '90s. </p> <p>In fact, many doctors now believe that what many of us put down as normal symptoms of office life - headaches, sluggishness, lethargy and nausea - could be symptoms of Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS) syndrome, a catch-all term that includes the sensitivity to manufactured fragrances. MCS has also been linked to dizziness, depression and hypertension. In offices where people are packed together and air conditioning takes the place of an open window, it is the chemicals in perfumes, deodorants, hairsprays and other personal products that are often most to blame. </p> <p>If fragrance-sensitivity sounds like a very modern syndrome, it's because the situation has got manifestly worse in the past few decades. According to Betty Page, who runs the Fragranced Product Information Network, there are more sufferers because there is more fragrance: \"Historically, fragrance has been for luxury and special occasion use,\" she says. \"Since the 1970s, fragrance has become a part of daily life. The use of fragrance has increased 10-fold since the 1950s. The fragrance industry doubled in size during the 1980s.\" </p> <p>But research into the effects of the cocktail of chemicals that go into every sweet-smelling scent has not kept up. The Women's Environmental Network (WEN) points out that, of the 30,000 chemicals currently on the market, only 10% have sufficient safety data and none has been tested for long-term repeated and cumulative effects. </p> <p>WEN's Helen Lynn says that office workers can face especially high levels of exposure: \"Air conditioning may well exacerbate the problem with fragranced air - whether from air fresheners or colleagues' perfumes - re-circulating round the building. It's similar, I suppose, to everyone getting the same cold when all the germs re-circulate round a well-sealed office. WEN has had a fragrance-free office policy for the last year and staff have reported health benefits in terms of absence of headaches, streaming eyes and a tightness of the chest, as well as a clearer head.\" </p> <p>In America, the fragrance-free office is moving into the mainstream, as fragrance-sensitive employees start to assert their rights. In the past three years, a growing number have claimed protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which governs employment-related civil rights. Under the act some fragrance-sensitive workers have forced their employers to provide \"job-related reasonable accommodations.\" </p> <p>The exact nature of those \"accommodations\" is still at the discretion of companies, but can include a completely fragrance-free environment. The Canadian city of Halifax has become the first major centre in North America to prohibit the wearing of all cosmetic fragrances - from Giorgio Armani to grandma's lavender soap - in most indoor public places, including municipal offices, libraries, hospitals, courts, classrooms, and buses. Others, like Santa Cruz in the US, have implemented partial fragrance-free policies. </p> <p>Less drastic measures that many American companies have instigated include fragrance-free toilets, where the afflicted can get temporary respite, and a ban on those fragrances the company can easily control, such as perfumed cleaning products and bathroom potpourri. The Job Accommodation Network, a group funded by the US Department of Labour, lists ways in which companies can and have responded to the increasingly vociferous calls for action from fragrance-sensitive staff. </p> <p>In Europe, however, only Germany has a national strategy to fight the effects of wider MCS. European legislation expected in early 2005 is likely to tighten regulation of the chemical industry, restrict the use of some chemicals, and improve product labelling. At the moment, a cosmetic product need only list \"parfum\" as an ingredient, a term that can hide up to 100 different chemicals. But office workers who suspect that fragrance-sensitivity may be the cause of their daily headaches have little recourse. According to experts on employment law, proving that a particular product or chemical is responsible for a list of non-specific symptoms is almost impossible. </p> <p>Nevertheless, many experts believe that, as more employees link their symptoms to chemical sensitivity, companies will be forced to implement some anti-fragrance policies or risk losing valuable members of staff. And there could be other economic considerations that force employers to take the issue seriously. \"I'm sure that many employees suffer from the effects of perfumes and fragrances but haven't made the link yet,\" says Gloria Miqueles of WEN. \"Companies should certainly encourage workers to avoid wearing them at the office because it would save them money, with reduced absenteeism due to ill-health, and also because people breathing fragrance- and chemical-free air work better.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week more than 450,000 night school enthusiasts will sign up to study everything from reflexology and information technology to Indian head massage and graphic design, in addition to the avalanche of in-house training courses that are now part and parcel of their daytime jobs. </p> <p>For a large proportion of these volunteer students - or in many cases, rookie teachers - going back to school instead of watching EastEnders or going to the pub will not only fill important educational gaps and add new skills to a CV, but may earn brownie points with the boss. Particularly, of course, if they themselves are willing to pay the fees, rather than charging them to the firm. </p> <p>Figures from the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education suggest that one can never become too rich, too thin or too proficient at Power Point to make it in today's ruthless business environment. Computer skills still top the popularity poll for evening classes - followed by health studies and business/management courses - in terms of career advancement, but there is no such thing as a wasted evening class, according to Fiona Aldridge, the Institute's development officer. </p> <p>She says: \"Although strict Government targets on basic learning attainment have perhaps seen a slight narrowing of what's on offer in evening classes, adult education is still something that people do for the sheer fun of it, as much as for improving their performance at work. There is a lot of research to suggest that even when people go on courses utterly unrelated to their job, there are enormous advantages to be gained in terms of extra self-confidence or better communication skills.\" </p> <p>Self-improvement courses tend to look good on a CV, but in terms of sport and physical fitness, today's class needs to contain one of two buzzwords in order to qualify as a suitable topic of conversation at the office. Thus, \"Power Yoga\" is appropriate to today's serious careerist (while freestyle yoga is dismissed as being aimed at housewives) and \"Pilates\" can only ever be an acceptable topic of conversation by the coffee machine if the classes are sub-headed something like \" .... for the Frantically Busy.\" </p> <p>Language courses will always be popular with bosses, particularly if the firm has a financial stake or customer base in that country, but to learn Conversational Spanish with Senor Jose Ferreras and a group of Costa-loving pensioners between seven and nine on a Monday is far less of a blatant career move than opting for a more earnest Doing Business in German course with Herr Wagner; which every Wednesday evening sees you struggling with the history of the euro or economic reforms at the Bundesbank. </p> <p>Just as learning how to translate commercial Italian into \"business speak\" English can mark you out as someone who is really prepared to suffer for the firm, a one-day course in emergency first aid will mark you down as someone willing to take on responsibility and could help your promotion prospects. </p> <p>In today's keen-to-give-back business environment, the best way to get noticed at work, though, is to spend your free time not learning but teaching others - even if it is Mexican cookery or Woodcarving for Pleasure. Teaching a roomful of cynical adult strangers something fairly hard-nosed such as Fun with Spreadsheets or How to Be Your Own Desktop Publisher will probably go down better with the average line manager than Kessho Reiki or Seeking Inner Wisdom, but the point is that tomorrow's business leader should feel far happier fronting than following. </p> <p>While becoming an evening class teacher hasn't always been as difficult as perhaps it should be - few night schools have to date been able to turn away those who will voluntarily spend their Friday nights showing others how to design personalised Christmas cards or read the Tarot - there are new moves in evening class land against the untrained. Experience as a parent does not equip the average 35-year-old with the skills necessary to handle bolshie adults taking up a disproportionate amount of the art teacher's time with their personal interpretation of the Nude; nor does it help when students on the legs, bums and tums course demand yet another tea-break. While it would be satisfying to teach only those who want to learn, the sad truth is that for every would-be mathematician who decides to make up for a misspent youth by re-taking their GCSE 20 years later, there are the professional night-schoolers who each summer yearn for self-improvement and who every October regret their enthusiasm for basic guitar, but insist on getting their money's worth anyway. </p> <p>Call it working through karma or even second adolescence, every night school course has at least one disaffected student who is already bored with Researching Your Family History Using the Internet or An Introduction to Digital Photography but who will keep on coming to the classes - and reminiscing loudly about the inadequacy of their own school days - until the bitter end. </p> <p>Whether you are a fellow-student watching in horror as the 40-year-old man next to you all but carves his initials in the desk, or a creative writing teacher who has just been challenged to improve on a student's unbelievably cheesy opening paragraph, adult education is fundamentally no different to primary school. Except that you are there by choice.</p>",
  "<p>School meals are to receive a radical makeover in an attempt to cut levels of salt, sugar and saturated fat and stem rising obesity in children. </p> <p>The government will today ditch discredited nutritional standards for school meals in what healthy food campaigners welcomed as a significant U-turn. </p> <p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, will make the announcement as part of the national Healthy Living Blueprint in which schools will be encouraged to work more closely with parents in helping youngsters to eat sensibly and adopt healthier lifestyles. </p> <p>The blueprint, published at the start of National Organic Week, will acknowledge that school lunches provide a significant proportion of children's daily food and nutrient intake - more than 30% on average - and can encourage pupils to eat more fruit and vegetables and less fat. Critically, ministers have agreed to look again at the nutritional standards for school meals they introduced in 2001, to cut levels of salt, sugar and saturated fat. </p> <p>In consultation with the catering and food industry, food interest groups, local authorities, and learning from best practice in schools, the government will look at ways of tightening up standards to further reduce salt, sugar and saturated fats in children's diets. </p> <p>The move is designed to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children under 11 by the end of the decade, a tough target recently announced by the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health as part of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole. </p> <p>The DoH has been closely involved in developing the blueprint, along with the departments of sport and the environment, food and rural affairs and the Food Standards Agency. </p> <p>The blueprint will encourage a \"whole-school\" approach to improving children's health, providing healthy options in meals, but also increasing physical activity and working across the curriculum to teach pupils about how to lead healthy lives. All schools will be urged to do more to teach youngsters how to eat a balanced diet and to encourage an interest in healthy food through gardening clubs or visits to local allotments. </p> <p>Today's blueprint admits that much more needs to be done to improve the quality of school food and it commits the government to providing additional funding to facilitate progress. The rules will apply to England and Wales. In Scotland the devolved government has already implemented quantified nutritional standards and agreed to spend an extra \u00a363.5m over three years on school meal reform. </p> <p>Mr Clarke said yesterday: \"Good health and effective learning go hand in hand; a healthy body leads to a healthy mind. The partnership of parents and school is critical in shaping good health in children, and schools are well-placed to lead by example.\" </p> <p>The Soil Association has welcomed the blueprint as a vital first step in improving the quality of school meals. The organisation first raised concerns about this issue last year in a highly critical report. It is still seeking guarantees that priority will be given to the youngest children at nursery schools and in primary school. </p> <p>Peter Melchett, the Soil Association's policy director, said: \"The government has a long way to go, but we warmly welcome this first, tentative step in the right direction. The promise of extra money is welcome, but it is crucial that the government commits funds to improve the quality of the food given to children in school.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was no Andrew Flintoff at Lord's yesterday: no mighty axeman strokeplay, no bullish bowling or swallow-catching. There is an absence of sentiment in this England team now. Fail to pull your weight and that's it - out. </p> <p>Only joshing of course. Flintoff was back at home awaiting the birth of his first child, and for once the team had to do without him. It would be nice to report that none of the capacity crowd noticed the difference. But his replacement Anthony McGrath made two runs and did not get a bowl, and in the final game of this three-match series England succumbed to a reshuffled and consequently rejuvenated Indian side by 23 runs. Even in his absence, the stock of the mighty Fred has risen. </p> <p>It ought to have been an easy task for England to complete a clean sweep. Batting first on winning the toss, India had struggled their way to 204, a modest total reached almost exclusively through the endeavours of Sourav Ganguly, who made 90, with three sixes and five fours, and Rahul Dravid's 52 (three fours and the rest in singles for him), the pair adding 93 for the fourth wicket. The Indian captain's dismissal, a catch clipped to midwicket, precipitated a slide, with the last seven wickets falling for 63 in 82 balls. </p> <p>Steve Harmison finished with four for 22, his best figures in any one-day match for England or Durham, to beat Harbhajan Singh - three for 28 yesterday to go with one for 14 in the previous game - in a close-run contest for a man-of-the-series award. Perhaps it should have gone to Steve Harbhajan to keep everyone happy. Not yet two years ago, in an Ashes warm-up game at Lilac Hill outside Perth, it seemed Harmison was conceding that number of runs in wides. </p> <p>England's reply was full of intent but lacking substance on a pitch that had been used the previous day for the encounter between Australia and Pakistan, and as such was well read by the Indians, who loaded their side with spin. Inside nine overs they had lost all but Michael Vaughan of their top five, albeit to the pace and swing of the left-arm pair Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan. </p> <p>When Paul Collingwood was brilliantly run out from short leg by Mohammed Kaif, and Geraint Jones, after smacking a six and a four, was superbly caught by Virender Sehwag at wide mid-on, the score stood at 62 for six and already the game seemed up. </p> <p>The best sides, however, the ones with the real depth, are able to look not at how many runs have been scored and wickets lost but at what is required to win. At that stage, provided a partnership evolved, a rate of about five runs per over was well within compass. Vaughan, for the first time in one-day internationals this summer, looked in prime form, driving crisply from the first, and in Ashley Giles, his bosom buddy, he found an experienced and willing ally. </p> <p>Together, with judicious strokeplay and careful placement, the pair added 92 in 145 balls, the required rate climbing but still in hand. </p> <p>It was Harbhajan's tenth and final over that sealed England's fate. Perhaps, the batsmen might reflect, they might have been content to see him out of the attack, much as Flintoff had done at The Oval on Friday, and taken their chances from the rest. Giles prodded half-heartedly at the first ball of the over, however, and although impeded by the non-striker Harbhajan held the return catch and set off in jubilation. </p> <p>Five balls later Vaughan advanced to his last delivery, which spun sharply and clipped a pad on the way down the leg side, from where the young wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik did well to gather the ball and demolish the wicket with the batsman still short of his crease. The England captain had hit eight fours and batted diligently for 141 balls to resurrect a position, only to relinquish it. After that the game was always India's. </p> <p>If Harmison's pace and accuracy took the bowling honours for England, there was the chance for Darren Gough to take centre stage on what was surely his last international appearance at Lord's. </p> <p>At The Oval he had been stuck on 199 one-day wickets for five overs, and was in his second spell yesterday when Harbhajan looped a gentle catch to backward point. It is more than 10 years since Alec Stewart caught Martin Crowe to give him his first wicket in his opening over and there have been a lot of tribulations in between, not least with injury, which has meant him missing 40 of 173 games played since his debut. </p> <p>By global standards 200 wickets is small beer - 19th in a list topped by Wasim Akram with 502 - because of the amount of cricket played in other countries. For England, though, only Ian Botham, with 145, and Phil DeFreitas, with 115, have reached even three figures and deservedly Gough stands head, shoulders and torso above them.</p>"
