  "<p><strong>Laurus/Ahold</strong><br> </p> <p>The Dutch, who enjoyed a model economy in the 1990s, are now taking to the streets in protest against cuts in government spending and tax increases to fund pensions for an ageing population - and staying away from high street stores. Consumer confidence is falling and consumption, after dropping about 1% last year and stagnating this year, is likely to grow only marginally in 2005. </p> <p>A price war led by Royal Ahold, the world's third-largest retailer, last week forced Laurus, its smaller and loss-making rival, to announce a \u20ac200m (\u00a3139m) rights issue to help fund a revamp of its Edah, Konmar and Super de Boer supermarkets which are losing sales. Laurus is shedding 1,290 jobs. </p> <p>Ahold last week reached a settlement with the US securities and exchange commission over long-running allegations of fraud at its US Foodservice unit after admitting to overstating its earnings. It has been forced to embark on a \u20ac2.5bn disposal programme, with the latest being the sale of its Spanish business to Permira for \u20ac685m. </p> <p>The group, which raised \u20ac3bn through a rights issue last year, is still struggling to perk up its shares and cut its \u20ac9.6bn debt after reporting in late August that its operating income had fallen by a fifth and its sales by 5% in the second quarter. </p> <p><strong>Carrefour</strong><br> </p> <p>Brits flocking to the Carrefour hypermarket just beyond the Channel tunnel exit at Calais could soon find their euros buying more food and wine. Nicolas Sarkozy, the outgoing French finance minister and would-be president, wants to encourage people to spend more by forcing the big retail groups and manufacturers to cut their prices. </p> <p>Carrefour, the world's second largest retailer after Wal-Mart, is already in a price war against its rivals, with Daniel Bernard, its chairman and chief executive, cutting \u20ac335m (\u00a3232m) from prices in a move to win back customers to out of town hypermarkets from the \"hard discount\" stores such as the German-owned Aldi and Lidl - and Carrefour's own Ed chain as well as Leclerc and Casino's Leader Price. These cut-price stores have trebled their market share to 12% in less than a decade. Mr Bernard, who was forced to issue a profits warning last week after poor third-quarter sales in France, which accounts for half of global turnover among its 10,378 stores in 29 countries. </p> <p>Unless France - one of the eurozone's better economic performers but still suffering with high unemployment - starts consuming more, his and Mr Sarkozy's cuts will depress revenues and income further. </p> <p>The group's shares have fallen by about a quarter this year. </p> <p><strong>Karstadt</strong><br> </p> <p>Germans, who celebrated reunification in 1990 with a spending spree east and west of the former border, are now sitting at home morosely saving. Unemployment approaching 5m, low growth, and acute insecurity about pensions and jobs have depressed consumer spending in Europe's biggest economy. It will fall again this year, by 0.3%, and, at best, rise 1.1% in 2005, economists said yesterday. </p> <p>KarstadtQuelle, one of the country's biggest retailers and owner of KadeWe, the Harrods of west Berlin, is in the throes of a crisis despite reaching agreement last week with unions on its plans to cut 5,500 jobs, reduce costs by \u20ac760m (\u00a3527.5m) over the next three years, close 77 of its 181 stores and 300 speciality shops and raise \u20ac500m through a rights issue. </p> <p>The group has seen its earnings collapse from \u20ac235m in 2001 to a loss of \u20ac300m in the first half of this year. </p> <p>Christoph Achenbach, brought in as chairman in early summer as the Karstadt share price sank, losing 40% of its value, has persuaded the unions to accept the scrapping of the Christmas bonus and his executive team to forgo their bonuses but his main strategy is to reduce the range of products on offer and cut the number of stores, selling off the smaller ones. \"Why sell bikes in inner-city stores?\" he asked.</p>",
  "<p>The struggling channel tunnel operator, Eurotunnel, has revealed that its trading was damaged over the summer holidays by the arrival of a cut-price ferry firm dubbed the \"easyJet of the seas\". </p> <p>Eurotunnel's operating revenue slipped 4% to \u00a3140m in the three months to September. The drop marked a deterioration against a weak summer last year, when the Iraq war deterred global travel. </p> <p>The French-led management team which seized control of Eurotunnel in April said passenger volumes were damaged by budget airlines and by the arrival of SpeedFerries, founded by Danish entrepreneur Curt Stavis. </p> <p>SpeedFerries is using a former Australian naval catamaran to carry passengers between Dover and Boulogne for as little as \u00a350 return. </p> <p>The number of cars using Eurotunnel's shuttles fell by 5% to 605,984, even though the overall cross-channel passenger market declined only 1%. </p> <p>The number of trucks fell by 4% to 302,445 against a freight market which expanded by 8%. </p> <p>Chief executive Jean-Louis Raymond accepted that the figures were \"obviously not satisfactory\" but blamed his predecessors, who were ejected by shareholders at a rancorous annual meeting in Paris six months ago. </p> <p>Mr Raymond said: \"These figures demonstrate that Eurotunnel's previous strategy was not adjusted to market trends in terms of capacity and pricing.\" </p> <p>Eurotunnel shares fell 1.25p to 20.5p. The setback came at a bad time for the board, which has to provide its bankers, HSBC and Credit Lyonnais, with a three-year business plan by the end of this month. Eurotunnel has debts of \u00a36.4bn. Its lenders have indicated that if they are dissatisfied with the business plan, they could take steps towards seizing control of the business. </p> <p>Creditors are sceptical about Eurotunnel's unorthodox new board, which includes a right-wing French MP, Pierre Cardo, and a former JP Morgan banker, Herv\u00e9 Huas, who is under investigation for money laundering. </p> <p>Eurotunnel's access fees from Eurostar and freight train operators edged up by 2% to \u00a358.8m. Revenue from its shuttles dropped 8% to \u00a377.7m. The channel tunnel operator intends to streamline its pricing structure, which at present offers a complex mixture of 18 or 19 different tariffs. It is yet to reveal the details of its new strategy. </p> <p>Industry experts said the only positive figure was a 7% rise in rail freight through the tunnel. \"These are not brilliant results,\" said one credit analyst. \"The new competitor in the shuttle business is the last thing they need. The Eurostar freight news is one crumb of comfort.\"</p>",
  "Here it comes again, that sinking feeling. Four years ago I travelled across the US, following the presidential campaign, and came away alarmed that Al Gore was not doing enough to win an election that should have been his. Now I have that same queasy feeling - except this time it's not only about the simple matter of who will win and who will lose on November 2. Now it's a deep concern about what is happening to the United States itself. <p>Start with the contest. Of course, after the 2000 melodrama, only an idiot would dare predict the outcome of this election. The polls are a statistical breath apart - though the latest all nudge in President Bush's direction - and the electoral college system means any number of twists are possible. Holding the states that should be reliably his, coupled with even a small uptick in Democratic turnout in the single state of Ohio, could still win the presidency for John Kerry.</p> <p>But the intangible, unscientific indicators - of mood, of atmosphere - leave me anxious. The events I saw on Monday are a good example. The morning was spent in Marlton, a small town in the rural south of New Jersey. The community centre there was packed for a Bush rally, filled with the usual cast of characters - the local pols, the dedicated volunteers, the women in stars-and-stripes sweaters. I was expecting enthusiasm from this loyal Republican audience. What I saw was fervour. </p> <p>The ear-splitting applause began before the candidate was in the room, stirred by the thunderous sound of Marine One - the presidential chopper - overhead. Once Bush entered, it was uncontained. He was received as a hero, his every sentence greeted with a rapturous ovation. </p> <p>His theme was \"A Safer America\"; his argument, that only he could protect the US. His opponent was weak, proposing a \"strategy of retreat\". He would \"take the fight to the enemy\". His opponent \"had chosen the easy path of protest and defeatism\", he stood firm and resolute: \"We will not let up in this fight.\" </p> <p>Every statement, delivered and punched home by Bush, brought a new wave of euphoria. \"You'll keep us safe!\" shouted one man. \"Amen!\" said another, before finally the room erupted in a chorus: \"U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!\" </p> <p>The very sight of Bush in New Jersey was a mark of confidence: the state, which has not voted Republican since 1988, should be firmly in the Kerry column. But that self-belief was entirely in keeping with the mood of the crowd. Asked if Bush was going to win the election, none hesitated: absolutely. </p> <p>Later that day, Kerry's running mate was performing in the next-door state of Pennsylvania. That the energy would be of lower voltage here was obvious; John Edwards is not at the top of the ticket. The contrast was striking, all the same. Edwards is a smooth, effective performer, but the room was hardly electrified. People wandered in and out; the applause was strong but not fervent. Asked if they thought they would win on November 2, these Democratic loyalists ummed and erred: they hoped so but were not certain. </p> <p>You can hardly blame them. America's centre of gravity has moved rightward, creating a set of shibboleths that cannot be challenged. If liberals established a few forbidden zones in the last 20 years under the rubric of so-called political correctness - making it off-limits to demean women, gays and ethnic minorities - then the right has now erected some barriers of its own. </p> <p>First among these taboos is the military. No politician can utter a word that seems to question the armed services: so Kerry does not mention the Abu Ghraib scandal. Next is 9/11, which has been all but sanctified in American discourse. Because of that event, the US has re-imagined itself as a victim nation: witness the yellow-ribbon bumperstickers, usually bearing the slogan \"Support America\". (Ribbons were previously reserved for the suffering: red for Aids, pink for breast cancer.) </p> <p>As a result, any action taken in the name of 9/11 cannot be questioned. Oppose the Patriot Act, with its restrictions on civil liberties, and you are a friend of the terrorists - and, if you are a Democratic congressional candidate, Republicans will air TV ads against you placing your face alongside that of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Show concern for international opinion, and you are some kind of traitor. Kerry spoke French to a Haitian audience in Florida on Monday, the first time he had done so in public for many months: even to appear to have links with the outside world is a negative in today's politics, which has become all about America first. </p> <p>All this is partly caused by, and certainly reinforces, that gut feeling of certainty that animates today's American right. Bill Clinton used to joke that when Democrats are in the White House, they think they are renting it. Republicans believe they own the place. </p> <p>The proof came during the Clinton years, culminating in the impeachment process: Republicans fundamentally did not accept the legitimacy of a Democratic president. Something similar was on display in Florida in 2000: the Republicans were determined and disciplined, convinced power should belong to them. That's what I saw in that hall in Marlton and why I am anxious about these next 13 days: when it comes to the dogfight of winning this close contest, I suspect the Republicans will simply be more ruthless about seizing the prize. But this political sense of entitlement has an extra edge, one embodied by the president himself. For his inner certainty is about more than partisan affiliation. It is a question of faith. </p> <p>George Bush is a born-again Christian, one of the 42% of Americans who describe themselves that way. Other presidents were religious, but Bush seems to have created something new - what even some of his allies call \"the faith-based presidency\". </p> <p>A striking profile in Sunday's New York Times magazine interviewed a clutch of Republican insiders who had discovered that belief is the organising principle of the Bush White House. Advisers, even cabinet members, are simply meant to believe in the wisdom of the president, whatever countervailing evidence there may be. Bush's former environment secretary, Christine Todd Whitman, is quoted: \"In meetings, I'd ask if there were any facts to support our case. And for that, I was accused of disloyalty!\" Senators are told not to worry about the complexities of Iraq; the president's \"instincts\", his \"gut\" tells him he's doing the right thing. </p> <p>\"This instinct he's always talking about is this sort of weird, Messianic idea of what he thinks God has told him to do,\" Bruce Bartlett, a Republican and former official in Bush's father's administration, tells the magazine. At a recent campaign event, one voter told Bush he truly believed God was now in the White House: the president did not argue. </p> <p>Most revealing of all is the phrase used by a Bush aide to dismiss the inquiries of the New York Times writer. The journalist is told he lives in \"the reality-based community\". People like him worry about observable facts, while the Bush camp lives in a different universe, a realm where belief shapes reality. </p> <p>Look hard enough and you can see this mindset in the current Bush campaign. The Bush-Cheney billboards with the single slogan: One Nation Under God. The unwavering certainty of the supporters in Marlton. Bush's inability to name a single mistake of his presidency. There can be no doubt; they are doing the Lord's work. </p> <p>Bush is a subtle enough politician not to make his campaign an overt religious crusade. But he communicates, through nods and winks, to his evangelical base: they know the mission he is on. He uses their language, answering a question on abortion by referring to a \"culture of life\", one of their favoured phrases, or nodding to a 19th-century supreme court ruling often cited in their own literature. </p> <p>This is a revolutionary shift for a country that was founded on the separation of church and state. If Bush wins on November 2, the chances are strong that the shift will accelerate, perhaps even towards permanence. </p> <p>Thanks to mortality, three or four spaces are likely to open up in the next four years on the nine-person Supreme Court. The next president will get to pick whether those judges are liberals or conservatives. </p> <p>In 2000, Bush said his favourite supreme court justices were the ultraconservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. If he named four more in their image, giving them a majority on the court, then the face of modern America could be changed within a few years. </p> <p>Such a bench would no longer deem abortion a constitutional right; it would allow individual states to ban it, which they would do, across swathes of the country. If past Scalia-Thomas decisions are any guide, laws on everything from clean air to access for the disabled, affirmative action for ethnic minorities to gay rights would all be struck down. (When the supreme court last year heard the case of a gay man arrested for having sex in his own home, Scalia and Thomas sided against the man and with the police.) Crucially, Thomas has argued that the Constitution's ban on established religion might not apply to the individual states. </p> <p>The campaign has hardly been fought on this ground. If anything, John Kerry has had to go along with the intrusion of religion into politics - insisting on his own Catholic credentials, telling audiences that he was once an altar boy. But the tension is there. </p> <p>It has manifested itself in the issue of research using embryonic stem-cells. Kerry says it should continue, using new lines of cells if necessary; Bush wants no more lines to be created, no more of what he calls the destruction of life. Kerry says stem cell research might have found a cure for Ronald Reagan's Alzheimers or for Christopher Reeve's paralysis. Bush says the work will have to stop. </p> <p>As the faithful streamed out of the Evesham Recreational Centre in Marlton, a Kerry-Edwards bus with a loudhailer was taunting them from across the road: \"Don't be scared of science, guys. Please guys, we need science.\" </p> <p>It seemed an odd kind of election slogan, but it might be right to the point. For the clash under way now is about more than Bush v Kerry, right v left. It seems to be an emerging clash of tradition against modernity, faith against reason. The true believers pitted against the \"reality-based community\". </p> <p>That leaves two questions, one for the future, one for November 2. For the future: how long can these two competing world views, so far apart from each other and so sharply divided, co-exist in the same country? For November 2: which of these two camps is going to be absolutely determined to win?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "India's bandit king died as he lived: in dense forests at the tip of a bullet. <p>For more than two decades, Koose Muniswamy Veerappan eluded hundreds of police officers devoted to nothing but his capture. </p> <p>Wanted for the murder of 130 people and for butchering 2,000 elephants, Veerappan taunted state governments, striking defiant poses in combat fatigues with his muzzle-loading rifle and his luxuriant handlebar moustache. </p> <p>While his profile had never been higher, his powers had faded. Life on the run had taken a heavy toll on the 57-year-old. An ageing brigand with asthma and a bad stomach, he had recently lost the sight of his left eye, reducing considerably his ability to pass unnoticed through the south Indian forest. </p> <p>His condition had made it easy for undercover police to infiltrate Veerappan's gang and convince the criminal mastermind to take a ride to a rural hospital. </p> <p>Inside the van lounged Veerappan and three of his closest associates. Just before midnight on Monday, on a deserted jungle road, dozens of policemen ambushed and killed the outlaw and his henchmen in a 20-minute shoot-out. </p> <p>\"He had already shaved off his moustache to conceal his identity. But we had lured him into a trap. We ordered him to surrender but he refused. It was a pukka operation,\" said Jyoti Prakash Mirgi, the chief of Karnataka's special task force, who co-directed operations with his counterpart in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. </p> <p>Although Veerappan had a $1m bounty on his head, a figure almost unheard of in India, this amount is a fraction of the 1.5 billion rupees (\u00a319m) state governments have spent since 1990 hunting for him. </p> <p>Such is Veerappan's myth that hundreds of locals went to the local hospital to ask police to put his body on display. </p> <p>The legend of the bandit king began 40 years ago when forest rangers beat up a short, wiry young boy for trying to sneak after ivory poachers. A few years later Veerappan shot his first elephant and joined a notorious hunter's gang. Before long he had taken over the operation, and he committed his first murder in 1969. </p> <p>Despite this bloody beginning, Veerappan was notable for little more than his facial hair. To many officials he was just another small-time poacher holed up in the woods. It was only when ivory sales were banned in 1986 that Veerappan began to display the ruthlessness, cunning and financial acumen that set him apart from other criminals. </p> <p>His remarkable escape from behind bars that year by killing four policemen and an unarmed forest official in their sleep alerted state governments to his cold-bloodedness. </p> <p>By the late 1980s he had made a small fortune illegally cutting and smuggling sandalwood. Veerappan also dabbled in extortion, demanding monthly payments from the lime quarry owners in the hills overlooking his jungle lair. </p> <p>This activity soon alarmed the southern Indian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which straddled Veerappan's domain. The 5ft 6in charismatic outlaw with an excellent shot became the target of forest rangers from both states. </p> <p>It was not long before the hunters became the hunted. Having spent his entire adult life in the forest, Veerappan was peerless in the art of jungle craft. He and his henchmen often mimicked the birds and deer in a system of warning signals that helped them dodge the authorities. </p> <p>Policeman, officials, even rival gangs were eliminated in vicious killing sprees. Veerappan once captured a senior forest official, beheaded him and hacked off his hands. He tied grenades to five policemen and blew them up in revenge for the capture of his gang members. He is also said to have strangled his own daughter. </p> <p>Most of his guns and equipment, including automatic rifles, were stolen from the police. Veerappan's gang ambushed patrols, made bombs and planted land-mines, blowing up official vehicles. </p> <p>Aware of his growing cult of personality, Veerappan cultivated the image of a romantic, gun-toting champion of the Tamil people and begun communicating to the outside world via taped messages and brief interviews with favoured journalists. </p> <p>He described his kidnappings and killings in detail, but depicted them as a righteous effort to avenge outrages committed by the police. </p> <p>In one particularly gruesome passage he recounted keeping the head of a victim as a \"souvenir\". Veerappan saw himself as a Robin Hood figure, protecting villagers who depended on illegally hunting elephants and cutting sandalwood for survival. </p> <p>His wife Muthulakshmi once said: \"Many may fear him but they also love him. He is always just, never misuses his power, helps out the villagers in their times of need [and] metes out instant justice to wrongdoers.\" </p> <p>Veerappan's media strategy also appeared to rest upon making politicians look helpless. Several times state governments accepted terms of his surrender, which included cash for the rehabilitation of his relatives and a minimal prison term for Veerappan himself in a special prison camp. India's most-wanted also demanded that a feature film be made about his life, and at one point insisted he would direct the film himself. </p> <p>Perhaps his most audacious criminal enterprise was to abduct south India's most famous film star, Rajkumar, in 2000. In what appeared a calculated move, Veerappan sought to inflame ethnic tensions between two of the largest communities in India: Tamils and the people of Karnataka. For the latter, Rajkumar was a cinematic god. </p> <p>The 100-day hostage crisis convulsed India and provoked rioting in Karnataka. Tamil newspaper offices were pelted with stones, schools closed and bus services were suspended. At least one fan committed suicide. </p> <p>Veerappan's demands for the release of Rajkumar read like a political manifesto for ethnic Tamils, with calls for the release of Tamil guerrillas and for statutes of Tamil poets to be erected in Karnataka. </p> <p>Despite this high-minded ransom note, the bandit eventually accepted $4.1m in cash and released the ageing matinee idol, who had high blood pressure and weak knees. </p> <p>Veerappan's next high-profile victim, a former minister, was not so lucky. His body was found two years ago on a roadside, riddled with bullets, after three months of being held captive by Veerappan. </p> <p>Recently more hi-tech methods were being deployed to track Veerappan. Armed with assault rifles and machine guns, police used night vision goggles, a global positioning system and helicopters to scour the jungle region. </p> <p>\"He was not mad, only extremely suspicious and alert,\" said Ajay Jha, one of the few reporters to have interviewed Veerappan. \"The guy could find his way through the forest in darkness and survive for weeks without food. But this man was nearly 60 years old. One has to ask why it took so long to capture him.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Crop circles </strong> </p> <p>President Lula da Silva of Brazil, once the hero of environmentalists for holding out on GM, has bowed to intense pressure and signed the order that allows farmers to plant GM soybeans. It may not make much difference, however. Some 30% of Brazil's soy is already grown with GM seeds smuggled over the border from Argentina, and Lula's order does not allow Monsanto to actually sell its seeds in Brazil. Monsanto, however, is delighted and is preparing to extract royalty payments from hundreds of farmers. Meanwhile, its share price has risen significantly on the New York stock exchange. </p> <p> <strong> Corridors of power </strong></p> <p> Wind power has had a good couple of weeks, with more than 300MW of applications passed by the Welsh and Scottish authorities. But what will the Welsh in particular make of an application to generate 60MW from the tides of Swansea bay? The idea, from a US group called Tidal Electric, is to construct \"tidal lagoons\" - simple structures of loose rock, sand and gravel, which hold water at high tide and generate power by releasing it back to the sea through turbines. A new report from leading engineers WS Atkins suggests the lagoons are quite capable of producing large amounts of very cheap power. Getting new alternative energy plans recognised by the DTI and through Welsh planners is something else, though. </p> <p> <strong> Air of defiance </strong> </p> <p>Thousands of people have pledged to take direct physical or financial action against any GM crops grown in Britain, but now we're all invited to take the \"airport pledge\". People signing it say they will take \"personal action to block airport expansion\" but are not asked to commit themselves to building tunnels or lying down on runways. It's managed by climate change campaign network Rising Tide, a coalition of environment and transport groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, People and Planet, and Transport 2000.

  "<p>Further signs of a slowdown in the property market were apparent today as mortgage lenders announced weak figures and a leading building company said it would be making a sales downgrade. </p> <p>Recent interest rate rises appear to have made buyers more cautious as the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported its first year-on-year drop in gross lending for four years - nearly 2% lower than September 2003 at \u00a325.4bn.</p> <p>At the same time construction company Taylor Woodrow said continuing negative coverage of the house market had caused buyers to take longer to commit to purchases. </p> <p>In an update that left the firm's shares 4% lower, the company said sales were likely to be 6% lower than the 10,000 homes it had previously targeted for this year. Other builders were dragged lower, with George Wimpey and Wilson Bowden both down 3%. </p> <p>Despite lower levels of activity, Taylor Woodrow emphasised that the UK housing market remained \"attractive\" and that visitor levels during August and September had been broadly stable on a year earlier. </p> <p>But Ed Stansfield, of consultancy Capital Economics, said the latest mortgage figures reinforced its earlier forecast that house prices were set for a correction. </p> <p>He said: \"Survey evidence suggests that new buyers have not returned to the market in any great numbers over recent weeks, so it seems likely that further falls in the mortgage lending figures can be expected. Our view remains that, with buyers still nervous and valuations in the market so stretched, recent modest falls in house prices will gather pace and become the dominant trend over the next two to three years.\" </p> <p>The CML data showed house purchase loans totalled \u00a311.2bn, down on August's figure of \u00a312.8bn and 23% lower than the record \u00a314.6bn recorded two months earlier in July. Just 44% of total lending was for house purchase in September, the CML added. </p> <p>Separate figures from the Building Societies Association provided further evidence of a housing market slowdown with approvals, or loans agreed but not yet made, down to \u00a32.81bn from \u00a35.15bn in September 2003.</p> <p>Analysts now expect the much cooler state of the market to limit the need for further rate rises from the Bank of England in the coming months. David Page of Investec Securities said: \"We are not expecting a rise this year with one more increase early next year as the economy is likely to benefit from a pick-up in global demand.\"</p>",
  "<p>Playgroups are gentle places. Sweet little children playing with battered but well-loved toys; their mums (and a handful of dads) chatting over tea and biscuits; a few rounds of \"wind the bobbin up\", then tidy-up time, coats and buggies and, reluctantly, back to the filth and depravity of your own home. </p> <p>For children, they are an introduction to the mixed pleasures of other kids, making friends, sharing toys and doing as they're told, ie, having to sit down at juice/carpet/music time. For grown-ups, they provide adult companionship, the chance to share parenting nightmares with similarly befuddled women who have egg in their hair and nappies in their handbags. </p> <p>Playgroups are very important places for your sanity in the early years of parenthood. A group of children learning to like each other; a group of adults who offer mutual support and shared parenting responsibility. At least for a couple of hours a week. </p> <p>That's what I thought when I took my boys round the corner every week to the church hall a few years ago. Nowadays, however, playgroups offer an additional bonus - the chance to buy, to sell; to make money and to spend it. Quietly, an almost invisible industry is growing in nurseries and in church and community halls across the country. </p> <p>While your daughter happily stuffs Play-Doh up her friend's nostrils, you can be scanning the pages of a variety of catalogues or watching demonstrations of products by other mums who are trying to earn a bit of money while trapped in the penury of early stay-at-home parenthood. </p> <p>And it's not just at playgroups. It can be in your own front room (provided you tidy first) and it's called party planning. </p> <p>It's a bit like those old Tupperware or Ann Summers parties, but without the crotchless knickers or food hygiene demos. Instead you can buy children's pyjamas, painted bedroom furniture, books, educational toys, games, greetings cards and cosmetics - all from the comfort of the juice table, or someone else's settee, while another watchful parent removes the potty (once full, now empty) from your child's head. </p> <p>Justina Byatt, 30, mother of 13-month-old Jennifer, sells for a new company called Mini IQ, which was launched in March by the giant mail-order company, Book Club Associates, and offers a range of children's books, toys and games. She had been working in London as a paralegal, sorting out corporate affairs for a US software company, but after she had Jennifer she moved with her husband to Weston-super-Mare. \"I knew then I had to find some kind of job. I was racking my brains thinking what I could do to earn money, while still having time to enjoy my daughter.\" </p> <p>She got a job shelf stacking in Asda, but at the same time heard about Mini IQ which put out a mailshot to National Childbirth Trust members (Mini IQ is the main sponsor for this year's NCT tea parties). \"I had never, ever dreamed of working in sales before, but I said I would do it because I loved the products. It's the kind of stuff I want to buy for Jennifer as she grows up.\" </p> <p>Byatt started as what's called an associate. Six months on she has graduated to become a \"leader\"; she has recruited her own team of 12 associates, is hosting three parties a week, either in people's homes or at playgroups, and is earning well in excess of her Asda salary (\u00a3350 a month) - without ever having to worry about childcare. Jennifer is always with her. </p> <p>Byatt is probably more ambitious than most who sign up for party planning. Some of her \"ladies\" just do it for the social life; but she is building up a small business. \"I met my first associate in a kids' play area and my next one was in a baby group. They sign up for different reasons - they want the flexibility, they're not working for anybody else and they don't have to worry about childminding costs because they take their children with them. </p> <p>\"It's a great way of getting out of the house and meeting new people. I'm earning money and I'm not having to leave Jennifer with anyone else. And she's getting so much out of the interaction she has with all the other children and the different environments.\" </p> <p>A new associate is trained up and pays \u00a399 for an introductory pack of 18 Mini IQ products, which should keep her going for the first six weeks. On average she will sell \u00a3190-worth of products at each party, earning 25% commission on sales. If she then recruits five or more of her own associates, she becomes a group associate and takes a commission from her team sales. She can make it as big or as small as she wants, holding as many parties, or as few, as she can cope with. </p> <p>\"It can take over your life if you let it,\" says Byatt, \"I took it on as a hobby, but it really has taken over my life. If I looked at the number of hours I'm spending at the moment and the money I'm earning, I'd think I was bananas. But I'm building a small business.\" </p> <p>\"We have a whole variety of different people putting different amounts of time into it, depending on their own personal circumstances,\" says Mini IQ general manager Andy Smith who already has 300 UK associates on his books. \"They are self-employed, independent people. For the associate it's a nice relaxed environment where she can show her products. And the big benefit for the customer is they can see and experience the products there and then. </p> <p>But these are not the only type of products on offer. Direct sales is big business, with turnover growing between 8% and 10% a year. Alice Wood, a mother of two, is a branch manager for Virgin cosmetics, which - like Bodyshop - has a highly successful party planning arm that generates a huge turnover. Again, it consists of coffee mornings, playgroups, evening parties - mums selling to mums in comfortable, convenient places. \"Most of our 'consultants' are mums,\" says Wood. \"It's geared towards people who want to fit it in their spare time. </p> <p>\"A lot of mums do it because they can work when they want to. It's just a way of earning some extra money. It's not a big high-pressure sales job. It's friendly and informal.\" They earn commission of 25%-34% on sales - some women will earn \u00a3200 a month, some much more, says Wood. \"If they choose to go further and they want to earn a lot more money, we do more training. There are consultants that sell huge amounts, especially at Christmas, for example.\" </p> <p>Henrietta Redpath, 31, first became aware of the buying and selling between mums when she took her three-year-old son to a local music group for toddlers. \"I started going to the group because of the social aspect of it, as well as for my son. I moved to the area 18 months ago and I didn't know anybody. It was a good way of meeting people. </p> <p>\"There was one woman I used to smile at, but we hadn't been properly introduced. One day she approached me brandishing this catalogue asking me, would I like be interested in 'doing Phoenix', as if I should know what it was.\" </p> <p>Phoenix is a catalogue business selling a selection of greetings cards, wrapping paper and gift tags. \"Because I was keen to make friends, I was very polite and said I would be interested. But I immediately thought, I'm not sure I really am. </p> <p>\"You can't get away from people selling to you now. You get cold-calling at home, people trying to flog you double glazing on a Sunday morning - even at toddlers' groups. I feel in a slightly compromised position because I was keen to befriend this woman. She's got a son, who's a similar age to mine - it would be nice to get to know her. But I haven't returned her catalogue yet, and I'm feeling a bit awkward.\" </p> <p>For those who like shopping this way it's good: they enjoy the convenience, the social aspect, the informality. But those who don't see a captive market of mothers too housebound to go to the shops, too weary to say no and in danger of being burdened with products they don't really want.</p>",
  "<p>I am pleased to address this joint audience of LGA Education and Social Services conference. This joint audience reflects the new world of children's services in which high educational standards and children's wider well being are rightly seen as an integral whole.</p> <p>Local government has played a central role in children's welfare and education, as well as in social history and social reform more generally over the past 125 years. </p> <p>A proud role but with a bitter sting in the tail. Local authorities have been key to tackling the problems of the day - to establishing new services that central government wanted. They have been the means of discharging society's and parliament's imperatives.</p> <p>So construction of sewer and public health systems came through local authorities. </p> <p>The first gas and electricity companies were municipal concerns. </p> <p>Local education boards were means of providing universal education. </p> <p>London county council (LCC) played a famous role at the turn of the 20th century in social housing. And the geography of outer London is to this day marked by the mental health asylums that the LCC created.</p> <p>After the second world war councils the length and breadth of the country were one of the key delivery arms of Harold Macmillan's housing drive.</p> <p>So the story goes on with public health services, children's services, sheltered housing, further and adult education. A proud record.</p> <p>In a phrase local government has been at its best when it has been at its most innovative. Identifying local needs, responding to new responsibilities, opening up new responsibilities.</p> <p>But that is only half the story. </p> <p>Because local government now has responsibility for very few of these services. </p> <p>Water, gas and electricity and sewerage are private concerns. </p> <p>The NHS is responsible for health. </p> <p>Much social housing has either been bought by former tenants or is being run by arms length bodies. </p> <p>Polytechnics and FE colleges are independent corporations. </p> <p>And here I am, so some of you think, trying to take schools away from you! </p> <p>Why this trend? </p> <p>In some cases economy of scale and investment required national organisation and action - so in the 1940s gas and electricity were nationalised. </p> <p>With some services - such as municipal housing - authorities were slow to respond to what people wanted as consumer aspirations rose and people expected a better service and wanted more control over their lives. </p> <p>And with some services - if we are honest - local government performance was (and in some places is) too patchy. Central government did not trust local authorities to deliver what it saw as being central to either the national good or its political purpose.</p> <p>You may say that that has been a wrong judgement but it is a fact. And has been a fact under governments of all political complexions.</p> <p>Bevan's decision to establish a National Health Service rather than go through local government was a very deliberate decision.</p> <p>The same with creation of the Manpower Services Commission to tackle unemployment. </p> <p>The same with FE. And then post 16 learning and the LSC. And most residential provision for elderly people. And Connexions Partnerships. And ring-fencing of grants.</p> <p>It's not that governments or ministers have thought that all local authorities are all hopeless. On the contrary, they know there are many many good councils out there, even a good majority. They know that they need local partners to deliver. But there has been an impasse. </p> <p>Local government has insisted on being independent. It has insisted on saying that all central government grant is 'our' money. That its local mandate is as valid as government's national mandate so ministers cannot tell councils what to do.</p> <p>On the other hand, ministers cannot be sure that if they make 'x' million available they will get 'y' outputs and outcomes in return. So they have gone for single purpose bodies with dedicated funding streams and clear accountabilities.</p> <p>Commentators then say that it is all a disaster. That successive governments have emasculated local government. That we are an awful terrible centralist government in a long line of centralising governments.</p> <p>Their answer - maybe your answer - is to just give all the power back to local authorities. </p> <p>That is both naive and unrealistic. It does not deal with the underlying issues and problems. </p> <p>As the secretary of state responsible for half of local government expenditure I want to end this historical stand-off. I want us to move on. John Prescott and I want a new settlement with local government. A new deal to benefit local government. A new partnership to boost opportunity and life chances.</p> <p>It has to be an honest settlement. </p> <p>First, honesty about the basis of the relationship </p> <p>The truth is that in certain areas the public wants, and expects, a universal - and uniformly excellent - service. Education standards and child protection are prime examples, where there is no public tolerance for a 'postcode lottery'. The public expect these to be provided as national services, which means that local government's role is in effect to act as agents for central government. We cannot deliver them without local agencies. But in these areas we need to be clear with our local partners on what they will deliver for what we provide.</p> <p>The other side of the deal - just as important - is that we should then allow you the maximum flexibility over how you achieve the agreed outcomes.</p> <p>That's of course the idea behind local PSAs. And now Local Area Agreements, which the deputy prime minister has championed. Our drive on funding rationalisation. New powers to pool budgets with other agencies.</p> <p>And, helping tie it all together, the development of the 'compact' philosophy through the new single conversations with local authorities. </p> <p>This is anything but mechanistic, process-driven relationship. It will be grounded in a shared understanding of our different roles in the delivery of national priorities. But also characterised by initiative and innovation. </p> <p>This, I've argued, is when local government is at its best. The last thing I want to do is stop you pushing the boat out in finding ways of securing better outcomes on the ground. And you must challenge us back if we are not moving fast enough to help you do just that.</p> <p>Second, honest about the nature of the relationship </p> <p>Let me say to you directly that your role will not for the most part be concerned with directly providing services - it will be increasingly about commissioning, and working with and through others.</p> <p>You face a huge and critical leadership challenge: vision and strategy, joining and empowering. Supporting and training others, joining up services and maximising linkages, increasing choice for users of services, getting people to work in partnership, spotting weaknesses and filling gaps. </p> <p>A role that plays \u00f1 here again \u00f1 to your historic strengths. To your role as community leaders. </p> <p>But leaving operational freedom to head teachers. To the managers of children's centres. Using a variety of partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors to deliver day to day services and so offer local people choice and quality.</p> <p>Third, central government should in return be honest about its need for local government. </p> <p>Central government should be positive rather than carping about local government's role. It should acknowledge a council's role as community leader. Within a clear framework of rights and responsibilities government should look to local authorities to lead and join up the work of other agencies rather than creating more and more new bodies to bypass them.</p> <p>That's why John Prescott gave you the power to promote economic, social and environmental well-being. And why, last July, he published a long-term vision for local government as leaders of their communities.</p> <p>And, fourth, central government should be honest about the limit to its own role. </p> <p>In those areas where you are providing local rather than national services - such as neighbourhood renewal and the whole liveability agendas - you should have maximum autonomy over what you do.</p> <p>That is the offer. A new deal. A new partnership. And to show that it is more than rhetoric let me set out what I think it means for key issues in some of the areas for which I have responsibility. I am looking to you to be key partners in creating an opportunity society.</p> <p><strong>Every Child Matters </strong> Local authorities have THE central role to play here. You will be at the heart of children's trust arrangements to drive though better outcomes for all children and young people. </p> <p>Leading work to ensure that really solid child protection arrangements are in place locally - with a strong emphasis on prevention - and to ensure whole-system reforms. We must never forget that the lessons of the Victoria Climbi\u00e9 inquiry were one of the prime movers of Every Child Matters. Ensuring universal services can meet the needs of vulnerable children is crucial.</p> <p>Leading strategic planning and needs analysis; commissioning services against the two poles of national expectations and local needs; driving through the changes needed on information sharing and the use of a common assessment framework. </p> <p>Building strong partnerships with voluntary and community sector providers. Extending the involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them. Supporting families and parents. And now an explicit, statutory role in bringing local partners together: PCTs, Connexions, Sure Start, and Youth Offending Teams where agreed locally. </p> <p>All this requires powerful but very sophisticated leadership. Bringing together strong, autonomous local organisations around a common purpose and shared outcomes. Getting the strategies and support networks in place which empower and join up front line services providers - including of course through extended schools and children's centres.</p> <p> This is far from easy. The key to local success is your leadership and your capacity to grow and develop in that role. Let me be honest again and say that seeking extra powers to require other people to do things - in particular front line providers like schools - is simply a blind alley.</p> <p>It is through your leadership and the quality of your operation that you acquire authority, win consent and gain cooperation.</p> <p>What then is government's side of the bargain? To set the legislative framework. Clarify outcomes, aims and targets. A streamlined and proportionate system of accountability that directly supports you and your health and other colleagues in delivering better outcomes through children's trusts. Supporting your local change programmes and your local leaders.</p> <p>To set the frameworks - and then to give you the flexibilities. To avoid prescription in how to develop children's trusts. To rationalise and streamline our engagement with you through 'field forces', simplified and better coordinated inspections, and a single conversation process.</p> <p>And a simplification of children's services grants - amalgamating from 2006 four small grants into a single Children's Services Grant; the maximum discretion to target services at local need within clear national expectations.</p> <p><strong>Early Years and Childcare </strong> Local Authorities have been at the forefront of this agenda. Local effort has ensured delivery of universal nursery education for three and four-year-olds and the huge expansion of childcare. Your role - as local authorities and as prime movers of children's trusts - will continue to be critical in the delivery as we implement our ten year childcare strategy. </p> <p>You know the challenges: too many families having to join up services themselves. Childcare that is not sufficiently affordable or economically sustainable, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Patchy quality. Complex delivery. The evidence on the benefits of early intervention when children are young is now so powerful we must ensure high quality services reach the most vulnerable if we really want to improve child outcomes. </p> <p>We shall look to you, working with your children's trust partners, to ensure the future availability of childcare and early years services. But, again, this is not [primarily] about hands on day-to-day delivery. </p> <p>It's about managing local childcare markets. About leadership, brokering and commissioning. About supporting children's centres, childminders and extended schools. Making a reality of your role as champion and advocates for parents and children eg giving parents useful information and advice so that they can choose high quality childcare .</p> <p>Here too it's about creating the conditions and the context. Persuasion not coercion. Leadership that is followed because of the compelling vision it communicates and the respect and support it has earned.</p> <p>We will agree targets based on clear outputs with individual authorities. But part of the deal from our side will be funding rationalisation as funding continues to grow. </p> <p>I've mentioned the creation of a single Children's Services Grant. We're also planning to merge the various Sure Start funding streams into one allocation for Childcare to give you flexibility to help us carry through our Childcare agenda. </p> <p>Next year we want to work with the 18 authorities which are piloting Local Area Agreements to see how this contract approach - money for outcomes - might work.</p> <p><strong>New Relationship with Schools </strong> And I hope you can see, in the same way, the role we look to you to play in developing the new relationship with schools.</p> <p>The goal is a more coherent, less burdensome and more effective set of relationships. Less clutter in our relations with you, and in our joint relationships, through School Improvement Advisers, with schools. The empowering of schools to drive up standards and improve outcomes; to expand when they are successful; intelligent support and challenge; rationalisation of Standard's Fund grants; a fit for purpose inspection framework.</p> <p>Local authorities as promoters of personalisation and choice for students, as quality assurers of education services, as capacity builders and as enablers of collaboration across common boundaries.</p> <p>As advocates for parents and children you retain key responsibilities for SEN, admissions, schools places. But it's still about giving direction through leadership, not looking around for powers of Direction with a capital D, anymore than you have with providers in other sectors.</p> <p>Winning through quality of leadership rather than power to direct. </p> <p>So for instance support for the work of admissions forums in developing protocols for 'sharing' hard to place children. Intelligent brokering of placements for looked after children around a shared vision grounded in the Every Child Matters 'five outcomes'.</p> <p>And a mature and supportive relationship with the new Foundation Partnerships. The agreement of improvement contracts, protocols or service level agreements for groups of schools to deliver services such as pupil referral units, SEN or school improvement services.</p> <p>We expect to publish our prospectus on Foundation Partnerships by December. </p> <p>I certainly hope you are also positive about the school transport bill, introduced in the House of Commons on October 14. Another example of an innovative role for local government.</p> <p>Here we're saying to pilot local authorities 'design the system that's right for the school, pupils and the community you serve'. Which is exactly as it should be.</p> <p><strong>14-19/Youth green paper </strong> For older children and young people Monday's report from Mike Tomlinson was a hugely significant step forward. We want to reflect carefully on the detail. But he has given us radical proposals for reshaping qualifications to stretch every child, to recognise the range of skills young people need for life, and once and for all to get over the academic/vocational divide that has bedevilled English education for far too long. </p> <p>You again will have a vital role to play. Working with schools and colleges to support them in developing new opportunities to combine study, training and the world of work.</p> <p>I am certainly clear, by the way, that the local authority can act as a powerful mediator to ensure that spending on skills meets local priorities. Your interface with employers - and as major employers in your own right - also gives you a key role in building the skills base local areas need to remain economically competitive.</p> <p>Another important publication late this year will be the youth green paper. It will set out a package of policy proposals for young people centred around access to exciting and enjoyable activities and to better \u00f1 and where needed earlier - personal advice and support. Local government will again be at the heart of our approach - not so much as organisers of youth clubs; but more as co-rdinators and supporters of volunteers and local effort.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion </strong> So those who predict the death of local government are wrong. </p> <p>Yes - we have left behind the local authority as the fount of all knowledge and as the controller of all services. </p> <p>But they are wrong - completely wrong - because your task, reflected in the appointment of directors of children's services and lead members for children's services, is to lead the drive for higher standards and better outcomes across the whole children's services agenda.</p> <p>And wrong - completely wrong - because we need you as leaders, brokers, commissioners and enablers, advocates and innovators in the delivery of services for children, young people, parents and families. </p> <p>We want you as partners in change; partners in progress. </p> <p>I hope you will accept this challenge and work with us in creating an opportunity society for all.</p>",
  "<p>Global warming threatens to reverse human progress and make international targets on halving world poverty by 2015 unattainable, a study published today said. </p> <p>The claim comes from charities including Greenpeace, Oxfam and Action Aid who have joined forces, under the banner of the <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/10/20/report.pdf\">Working Group on Climate Change and Development</a>, to release the report, called Up In Smoke, in London today.</p> <p>The group's warning follows a summer in which hurricanes Jeanne and Ivan wreaked havoc across the Caribbean and Bangladesh saw its worst flooding for years. </p> <p>In a world in which global warming is a reality, it says, such severe weather events are likely to become more frequent and extreme - and the poor will be hardest hit. </p> <p>The group is urging the international community to take urgent action to introduce: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A global risk assessment of the likely costs of adaptation to climate change in poor countries</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries of between 60% and 80%, relative to 1990 levels, by the middle of this century. This goes far beyond the targets of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. </p> <p>The report says the cuts are vital in order to stop climate change running out of control - defined as a rise in global average temperatures of more than 2C (4F) above pre-industrial levels. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> New funding to help poor countries adapt - bearing in mind that rich countries' subsidies to their own fossil fuel industries stood at $73bn (\u00a340bn) a year in the late 1990s. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Effective and efficient arrangements to respond to the increasing burden of climate-related disaster relief.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Small-scale renewable energy projects promoted by governments and community groups that can be copied and developed in order to help tackle poverty and reduce climate change. </p> <p>This move will require political commitment in the form of new funds from governments in all countries and a major shift in priorities by the World Bank and other development bodies, the report says. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Coordinated local and international plans for relocating threatened communities with appropriate political, legal and financial resources.</p> <p>The report says the prime minister, Tony Blair, has signalled that he will use the UK's presidency of the G8 nations in 2005 to bring the issues of climate change and Africa - where many of the world's poorest countries are found - to the top of the international political agenda. </p> <p>Welcoming this commitment, the coalition says an either/or approach to climate change and poverty reduction is not an option: the world must face up to the inseparable challenges of poverty and a rapidly warming global climate. </p> <p>Andrew Simms, author and policy director of the New Economics Foundation, which organised it, said: \"Thousands of people, from the grassroots to Gordon Brown, are aiming to make poverty history, but global warming has been critically overlooked. Like a fire smouldering in the basement it threatens to burn down all they have built up. </p> <p>\"To rescue the situation we need a global framework to stop climate change that is based on equality, and we have to ensure that plans for human development are made both climate proof and climate friendly.\" </p> <p>Archbishop Tutu, Nobel Peace laureate and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, said: \"I urge governments and development and environmental organisations to work together to find sustainable solutions to avert a catastrophe that will exacerbate human suffering to a magnitude that perhaps the world has not yet seen.\" </p> <p>The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Blair would make climate change a priority during Britain's presidency of the G8.</p> <p>Ms Beckett said: \"No one can welcome what the report says, but ... I very much welcome the direction of the report and the way that it is bringing people with these concerns together.\" </p> <p>She said she hoped the report would increase pressure on the US to shift its stance on global warming. </p> <p>\"It is true that the present American administration - and the last one - were not prepared to sign up to the Kyoto protocol, but we are moving on without America,\" she said. </p> <p>The environment secretary rejected claims that climate change could only be halted by a switch to nuclear power. </p> <p>The government has not ruled out the future development of nuclear power, but Ms Beckett made it clear that she did not accept the argument that it was a \"clean\" fuel because it did not produce carbon emissions.</p>",
  "Low level radiation from nuclear power plants could be up to 10 times more dangerous than had previously been thought, a panel of experts said today. <p>A committee set up to examine radiation safety said action was needed to deal with new information about risks from radioactive particles that could be swallowed or inhaled. </p> <p>However, the report from the committee examining radiation risks of internal emitters (Cerrie) fell short of recent controversial claims made by two of its members, who said radiation doses to child leukaemia victims across Europe could have been 100 times higher than experts believed. </p> <p>Cerrie - whose members include university scientists and members of Greenpeace and British Nuclear Fuels - said uncertainties meant the risk faced by people exposed to nuclear particles could range from 10 times the previous estimate to almost zero. The report concluded there was no \"no clear evidence\" that current radiation risk assessments were \"substantially wrong\". </p> <p>The government radiation watchdog, Comare (committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment) said it agreed with Cerrie that the available data did not support a \"speculative hypothesis\" that risks had been radically underestimated. </p> <p>It also agreed that current evidence did not indicate a need for a fundamental change in radiological protection standards. </p> <p>However, Comare said it had reservations about the way in which Cerrie had been set up, and claimed its composition \"was influenced by environmental politics rather than science\". </p> <p>Cerrie was established by the then environment minister Michael Meacher in 2001 amid concerns over radiation risks, including reports of increased incidents of cancer near nuclear sites and in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. </p> <p>Mr Meacher last month sparked a row by accusing the committee of gagging two dissenting experts. His comments came at the launch of a \"minority report\" from Richard Bramhall and Chris Busby, who argued that the risk of cancer from low level radiation was much higher than officials estimated. </p> <p>According to their report, inhaled radioactive particles could lodge in the body of a foetus and damage cells in a confined area. </p> <p>Unborn children were said to be especially at risk, and it was claimed the hazard could explain clusters of leukaemia cases near nuclear installations in north Wales and Essex, and the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. </p> <p>Mr Meacher alleged attempts had been made to suppress the evidence, and last month told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1299369,00.html\"> the Guardian</a>: \"The idea was to examine all the questions and, where there was disagreement, to recommend further research. </p> <p>\"It is criminally irresponsible not to allow all the evidence to come out so there can be a properly organised, informed public debate.\" </p> <p>Even before the row over reports, the issue had divided members of Cerrie. One nuclear scientist - Marian Hill, who was part of the committee's secretariat - resigned, alleging establishment bias. </p> <p>Launching today's report, the Cerrie chairman, professor Dudley Goodhead, said: \"The main findings of the committee's report is that we have to be particularly careful in judging the risks of radioactive sources inside the body. The uncertainties in these internal radiation risks can be large.</p> <p>\"The report examines the views of all members, including hypothesis for very large risks put forward by two members, who finally dissented from the report,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The committee concluded that the available scientific evidence did not support these hypothesis and, in many cases, substantially contradicted them.\" </p> <p>The report warned that newly discovered affects of radiation - including long term damage to DNA within cells, and inherited DNA changes - were \"real biological events that need further research\".</p>",
  "<p>Scottish &amp; Newcastle today allayed fears of a brewer's droop by insisting European beer markets had recovered to anticipated levels after a damp summer.</p> <p>The company - whose top four UK sellers are Foster's, John Smith's, Kronenbourg 1664 and Strongbow - issued a third quarter trading update, conceding the UK beer market had been \"relatively weak\". It said the poor summer weather was \"compounded by a drop-off in off[-licence] trade demand following the end of the Euro 2004 championships\".</p> <p>The Edinburgh-based group said that given the \"testing market conditions\", its UK business had a positive quarter. Sales of the top four brands were up by 5%, despite a decision not to cut prices over summer.</p> <p>S&amp;N - the market leader in seven European countries, including France, Russia and the UK - said its performance was down to \"improving operational efficiency\" and that \"greater competitiveness across our businesses combined with recovering demand gives us confidence we will meet market expectations for 2004\".</p> <p>\"We have seen a difficult trading environment, but we are performing well within the market. July was difficult, August improved and September was back to more normal levels,\" said the S&amp;N finance director, Ian McHoul.</p> <p>He said the company decided to issue an update after a run of weak trading statements from other consumer goods groups. </p> <p>The statement also said that overall beer volumes in France were markedly lower in July and August, with the market expected to be 6% down in 2004. But in eastern Europe, sales of Russia's market leader, Baltika - a joint-venture with Carlsberg - saw third quarter growth of 25%.</p> <p>And in the US, S&amp;N said Newcastle Brown Ale \"continues its double digit growth, well ahead of the import sector\".</p> <p>Analysts said today's update was unlikely to result in a change from consensus forecasts for 2004 of \u00a3364m in pre-tax profits, with underlying earnings per share up more than 10% to 29.5p.</p> <p>At 10.30am, S&amp;N shares were up 12p to 395p.</p>",

  "<p>I am in a quandary. Usually Adrian Searle writes about the Turner exhibition, but he's a judge this year. I guess I'm supposed to view the nominated artists - Jeremy Deller, Kutlug Ataman, Langlands and Bell, and Yinka Shonibare - objectively. Instead, I'm utterly partisan. I want Deller to win. </p> <p>What is the Turner? The prize is not given for being a good painter, or an accomplished film-maker, or a technically brilliant maker of architectural models. It is given for being an \"artist\". Some academic once wrote that the idea of the artist dates from the 1960s only. Before then, you were a painter or a sculptor. Now you can belong to this open and abstract category. </p> <p>Actually, the idea of the artist as a controlling mind, rather than a dexterous hand, is far older. It was institutionalised by the Royal Academy and similar organisations in the 18th century. Then the Romantic movement set the idea of the artist alight and gave us the spontaneously creative free mind, the artist as visionary and saint. </p> <p>The Turner prize is deeply, woozily, classically Romantic. It is awarded not for a set of interesting works but for an overarching sensibility: for being an artist in the full and Wagnerian sense of a master creator, a generator, like Michelangelo, of \"divine concepts\"; for being not a maker but a thinker and a feeler. What else can the Turner be awarded for? The cleverest way of installing a video? </p> <p>There are a lot of different ways of installing videos in this year's Turner. Langlands and Bell even have an interactive digital film that reconstructs the house of Osama bin Laden. You work a joystick to move towards the house, then back again, then around. The pleasures and frustrations of this fiddling-about entirely eclipse any possible meaning the work may have. </p> <p>Ataman has six screens hanging in the dark at angles. Six people are talking about their lives - their past lives; all apparently believe they have been reincarnated. I have no idea why Ataman was shortlisted. If you encountered this installation at a biennial, which is where it unmistakably belongs, you would move on. Let's do that. </p> <p>Shonibare is a much more considerable artist and a good second best. A little bit rococo, he loves flouncy, colourful costumes and 18th-century art. In the past he has retold Hogarth's Rake's Progress as the story of a black dandy. Here he exhibits a charming tableau reproducing the central figure from Fragonard's The Swing - she kicks up brown legs over which she wears white stockings, and as her shoe flies off so do constraints of race, gender and history. </p> <p>Shonibare's film A Masked Ball is exhibited in a third way: as traditional cinema. Based on the assassination of Karl Gustav III of Sweden in 1792, which also inspired Verdi's opera, the film is essentially another excuse to show people in fantastic costumes, made of printed fabric like that manufactured in Manchester for export to west Africa in the 19th century. It's an intriguing film, in which the masked revellers are weirdly choreographed, executing a rich-hued dance of death. </p> <p>If the Turner prize were awarded for formal achievement, Shonibare would deserve it, at least from this shortlist. But as an artist of ideas, which is what the Turner is truly about, he has just two, and both are derived from postcolonial cultural theory. He has what Ben Elton used to call a bit of politics. But being \"political\", as Elton's work reminds us, doesn't instantly make art or comedy good, or even political. </p> <p>For fairly obvious global reasons, politics are all over this year's Turner show. Langlands and Bell are the most relevant: their exhibits derive from a trip to Afghanistan as official artists commissioned by the Imperial War Museum. But as reportage, which is pretty much what this claims to be, or as polemic, or as mordant irony, their art is singularly lacking in warmth or directness or point. The flags that play with the acronyms of non-governmental organisations at work in Afghanistan are just banal. To be fair, one of their films cannot be seen, on the advice of Tate lawyers. It is feared to be in contempt of current trial proceedings at the Old Bailey. Perhaps this is a work of great genius, but Tate Britain apologetically refused to tell me even the name of the invisible masterpiece. </p> <p>That's enough balance. I want to talk about Deller. I've followed Deller's work ever since he collaborated with the Williams Fairey Brass Band in Stockport, creating Acid Brass, a concert of 1980s acid house classics arranged for brass band. A joke? It turned out to be beautiful and innocent and unfathomably serious. In his Turner show, Deller exhibits a huge diagram of Acid Brass that demonstrates how brass bands played in the miner's strike, how warehouse parties were the result of de-industrialisation, and how the media hysteria generated by ecstasy resembled that about the strike. </p> <p>Deller's most famous \"work\" is The Battle of Orgreave. It was extraordinary to stand in a field on the edge of an English village and watch meticulously staged battles between shirtless miners and bluebottle police beating their riot shields. It was history: the sky was overcast, the landscape marked by industry and war. It ended with police charging like medieval knights down a street in a quiet village, scattering the working class, clearing the way for a more efficient Britain. </p> <p>Is this art? Who cares? Deller matters, but I feared that without the immediate grandeur and humanity of the social actions that are his contribution to recent British culture, he would be passed over. That was before I saw Memory Bucket: A Film About Texas. This is an actual work to watch in a gallery. And it has the most truly memorable images in this year's Turner. It's a documentary, a travelogue, that goes from Waco, Texas, where David Koresh and his followers died in a confrontation with the Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1993, to nearby Crawford, where George W Bush has a ranch. Deller does not indulge in fatuous execrations of the US, Texas or even Bush. Instead, he reveals the complexity of Texan history. </p> <p>Christian fundamentalists praise Koresh for defying the state. A waitress at the diner where Bush eats hamburgers testifies to how charming and charismatic she finds the president. Protesters gather and Bush's cavalcade - including an ambulance with cardiac facility - glides through the Texan night. Willie Nelson sings. It ends with a sequence that really deserves David Attenborough's honeyed commentary, but instead is accompanied by the terrifying sound of millions of wings beating. A horde, an infinity of black bats, is bursting out of a cave into the night. Apocalyptic and beautiful, it is an image of intense foreboding. </p> <p>Memory Bucket is a Texan furniture store. It's also a description of Deller's enterprise. He provides a library at the centre of the room; you can read about bats or browse the Hutton report. Making good political art is almost impossible. Deller makes it fun.What sets him apart is his utopian optimism and belief in people. Even in Texas he finds a lot to like. He has things to teach not just artists, but activists. Misery and rage have been the dead language of radical protest since the fall of Marxism. Yet Deller affirms the old socialist resources of history, memory and hope. To do it as \"art\" is delightful and funny - as if historian EP Thompson had collaborated with Joseph Beuys. </p> <p>The other artists here present product. Deller invites you into a conversation. He is, however, a real artist, a genuine and subtle exponent of Robert Rauschenberg's desire to act in the space between art and life. Deller is the only artist in this show, and one of the few of his generation, anywhere, who has a real vision. His work enriches lives - it has certainly enriched mine. I can't say that of anything else in this year's Turner prize. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The Turner prize 2004 exhibition is at Tate Britain, London SW1, until December 23.

  "Old hands at the UN like to tell the old joke about the Italian ambassador who is annoyed that his country is being ignored in the debate about reforming the security council to better reflect contemporary global realities. <p>Germany and Japan are both making rapid progress towards the world's top table, complains the envoy - preferably in an exaggerated comic opera accent - so why not us? After all, the punchline goes: \"We lost the war too.\"</p> <p>The joke makes a serious point: 60 years after the defeat of fascism, the five permanent members of the security council - known in diplomatic shorthand as the P5 - are the victors in that conflict.</p> <p>Of these, the US is indisputably the most powerful country on the planet. China is the most populous country in the world, and one of its fastest growing economies. </p> <p>However, today's Russia is a pale shadow of its former Soviet self. Britain and France are medium-sized European powers who happen to possess - as do the other three members of this exclusive club - the legally-sanctioned nuclear weapons they acquired during or after the second world war. All five wield the vetoes that can, in theory, make or break momentous international decisions.</p> <p>Italy's claim, it has to be said, was never compelling. So the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, this summer proposed that the EU should get its own UN seat - an eminently sensible way of representing 25 member states and 450 million people, even if his transparent motive was to prevent the Germans from getting a seat for themselves.</p> <p>If any single European country deserves a place in the UN sun, it is Germany - reunited, and with a population of 82 million, it is the continent's largest country and economy, and a provider of peacekeeping forces from Macedonia to Afghanistan. </p> <p>Past sensitivities, however, are never far away, and some - for example the Poles - detect disturbing signs of the return of the sort of self-assertion by Berlin that went out of fashion for decades after 1945. </p> <p>Britain and France are enthusiastic supporters of the German claim - although cynics say, reasonably enough, that is only because they want to deflect pressure for a common EU seat. The security council, FO mandarins say, is to be enlarged, not reformed - a subtle but crucial difference.</p> <p>The bigger point, though, is this: what justification is there for a change that brings in more wealthy western countries but still excludes Africa, Latin America and the entire Muslim world, and that would leave the north-south divide as wide as ever before?</p> <p>Last month's debate in the UN general assembly, at which all 191 member countries had a go at thrashing out the issue, went some way towards sorting out these competing claims. After years of lobbying, Japan won a two-year stint in one of the security council's 10 rotating seats, hoping to prove that it deserves that coveted permanent seat when the reform process is accelerated next year.</p> <p>Momentum seems assured by the fact that Japan, Germany, Brazil and India - collectively known as the A4 - have now formally agreed to support each other's candidacies for permanent seats. </p> <p>Japan has gone further than any of the others in proving its credentials. It is heavily involved in key international issues, including the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa, and is a big contributor to UN coffers. It has also pledged to focus on the so-called \"new threats and new challenges\", including the prevention of transnational terrorism and weapons proliferation - preoccupations for everyone in the post September 11 world.</p> <p>Japanese progress has, however, whetted the appetites of other wannabees, triggering strong opposition - China and South Korea are both against Japan's bid. India has an excellent case as the world's largest democracy but, not surprisingly, it is opposed by Pakistan, which fears India would scuttle its proposals on Kashmir.</p> <p>Argentina and Mexico both want to prevent Brazil from getting in to represent Latin America. Africa, which was still largely ruled by European colonial powers when the UN was set up in 1945, could legitimately be represented by South Africa, Nigeria or Egypt, although post-apartheid South Africa has by far the best credentials.</p> <p>Simply expanding the membership of the council however, would actually prove to be a fairly minor change - doodling in the margins of the global narrative, as one expert put it. </p> <p>No reform makes sense without looking back at the council's recent history, and most notably its failures over Kosovo and Iraq, both cases in which irreconcilable splits at the top meant that military action was taken without the formal sanction of the whole body, undermining its overall legitimacy.</p> <p>Iraq, of course, was far worse because of the limited nature of support for the US-led invasion, whereas the entire Nato alliance - including France and Germany - backed action against Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p>The war against Saddam Hussein showed, all too cruelly, how paralysis during the cold war has been superseded by a unilaterally induced paralysis, the product of insuperable US hegemony. Even a more ambitious UN reform would be unlikely to change this.</p> <p>Yet Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, is still determined to try. He is currently awaiting the recommendations of the cumbersomely named High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, which is tasked with finding ways to make multilateralism work.</p> <p>Its conclusions, which are due out in December, may not be good news for those aspiring to get a place round that famous horseshoe-shaped table on New York's East River. </p> <p>According to diplomatic gossip, the panel's favourite option is for seven of eight semi-permanent members to serve a four or five-year term, plus one new rotating two-year seat, resulting in a total UN security council of 24. </p> <p>Simply adding a few more seats and vetoes to the current model is likely to result only in further gridlock. So disappointment seems guaranteed, and not just for those frustrated Italians.</p>",
  "<p>Before I meet Phil Frampton, I have become intimately acquainted with his childhood. His memoirs of growing up in the care of children's charity Barnardo's, and tracing the parents he never knew, gripped me with sadness and curiosity. And so I had a pretty good mental image of my hero - a tall, black, bespectacled firebrand, surely, with a mop of unruly hair and a youthful smile. The man who greets me is medium height, light skinned and has a shaved head. He's hesitant, undemonstrative. An unlikely hero. </p> <p>When Frampton, at the age of 14, first clapped eyes on his mother, in a photo sent to him a year or so after her death, he was bitterly disappointed. As he recalls in his book: \"I wanted her to be another woman in one of the photos. This other woman was pretty and appeared confident and strong. Mavis was the gangly, thin woman who appeared to be weak and mentally fragile. There was nothing in her pictures that I wanted, not an ounce of hope. I needed an image of a mother who was strong and able to be a receptacle for my love, a mother who would carry me, not a burden for my own back.\" He tore up the photos. </p> <p>The truth hurt, and it was to be another 30 years before Frampton began painfully to unravel the reasons why his mother had abandoned him, and to build up a picture not only of his parents' lives but also of his own. Now it is all laid bare in The Golly In The Cupboard, a moving, and at times shocking, journey into his past. </p> <p>Asked why he wanted to share such an intimate story, Frampton says he set out to defend children brought up in care. \"I wanted to show that they're not just damaged goods.\" The book is also a social history, charting the hypocrisy of the 1950s, a so-called golden age, when women were packed off to Cornwall to give birth to illegitimate children, and mixed race parentage was considered a physical defect. </p> <p>At times, you want to rage at the sheer injustice and callousness of Frampton's care world. Of the therapeutic qualities of writing, Frampton is dismissive. \"It's only as therapeutic as building a chair,\" he says. \"But the files did allow me to analyse things.\" </p> <p>The files in question are the 733-page dossier that Barnardo's kept on him for 40 years and was obliged to hand over a few years ago. In 1999, Frampton wrote in Society Guardian of his battle to get hold of the files, and his initial shock at what was revealed by the medical reports, letters from his godmothers, and official correspondence - in particular, that Barnardo's had not prevented his mother from seeing him, that estrangement was her choice. </p> <p>The first part of the book seems designed to rescue his mother from condemnation, something he says - in a later chapter - he needed to do. He still wonders whether a Barnardo's matron did ever write to his mother and tell her not to contact him. No such letter is on file, but he was told by his godmothers that one was received, and he clearly wants to believe them, though he knows they have lied in the past to protect Mavis. \"My mother's attitude to me is still out for further questioning,\" he says. </p> <p>He is clearer about his father, Isaac. Attempts to meet the African engineer and tribal chief before he died were thwarted. But Frampton was reassured to discover in the files that the man he had thought irresponsible for all these years was forced to leave the country. \"I'd had a low sense of his personal integrity, so it made me feel better about him,\" he says. </p> <p>When the book was published earlier this year, Barnardo's accepted the critique of the care system - with its arbitrary punishment, racist attitudes and appalling lack of hygiene - and put the book on its recommended reading list. But now the book is at the centre of a legal wrangle over allegations of child abuse. Just after Frampton moved out of Tudor Banks, the Southport home where he spent most of his childhood, there was an alleged horrific period of abuse.</p> <p>He heard about this at a Tudor Banks reunion party several years later, and from there he pieced together his powerful account of what went on. As chair of the Care Leavers Association (CLA) for three years until last year, he repeatedly called on Barnardo's to work with other charities and government to set up a reparation scheme for victims of child abuse in children's homes. \"Ministers have made noises, but nothing has happened,\" he says. </p> <p>As for the allegations about Tudor Banks in the book, Barnardo's says it would be inappropriate to comment for legal reasons. This episode, coupled with the bleak picture Frampton paints of his teenage years in a home, would, you'd imagine, make him supportive of government policy to place all unwanted children in families. </p> <p>On the contrary, he fears this will stigmatise children who do end up in a home, and he points to his two unsuccessful foster placements: aged four, with a vicar's family from Bolton; and, aged 15, a short stay with a middle-class couple, where he was almost sexually abused. \"I had regrets at the time of being brought up in a children's home,\" he admits. \"But I've now met enough people who grew up in families, and are mashed up, to see, in one sense, that I was fortunate. The issue is that my real needs weren't being considered. It was the adults' needs. In many foster placements, that's the case today. I'd like to see young people have the choice between children's homes, fostering and adoption.\" </p> <p>That choice is hamstrung by a lack of foster carers and a massive home closure programme. In Birmingham, where Frampton is reading extracts of his book to a forum of black social services and health managers, there are only a fraction of the 100 council-run children's homes left. He accuses the government of championing the cheap option. It costs an average \u00a33,000 a week to keep a child in a children's home, he says, whereas foster care \"costs less than a cattery.\" </p> <p>\"People have this nightmarish vision of children's homes, but, with reasonably trained and paid staff, they can provide children with a stable environment,\" he argues. Has he ever thought of becoming a foster parent? \"Never ever,\" he says, launching into a tirade against a system that shifts children from family to family. \"It's psychological abuse.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, I recognise the angry young Frampton, who was \"sensitive about his colour\" and hit anyone who racially abused him. \"One in six children are moved at least three times a year, and there are reports of children being shoved from home to home up to 60 times in 10 years,\" he says. \"They are carrying a bin bag, sat in a social work office, being told where they can go, or they leave them overnight in police stations because there is nowhere to put them.\" </p> <p>Frampton recalls a young woman in the CLA in Liverpool, who said that, after going to 13 schools, she gave up making friends. For anyone who wants to do something to help the current generation of Phil Framptons, he warns: \"This is about you doing something for a young child, not something for yourself; otherwise that kid would be better off in a kids' home.\"</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 51 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Separated, two teenage daughters </p> <p><strong> Lives</strong> Manchester </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> King George V Grammar school, Southport; Bristol University, studied geography, changed to sociology and politics (dropped out) </p> <p><strong> Career </strong> 1978-93: organiser for Militant, the hard left of the Labour party; 1993: freelance market research consultant, travel writer, journalist; 2004: published author </p> <p><strong> Public life</strong> 2000-03: national chair of the independent Care Leavers Association; 1994: chair of the Manchester Parents of Black Children </p> <p><strong> Interests </strong> Reading, travel, India, political science, sports. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The London launch of The Golly In The Cupboard is at Willesden Green library's Studio 95, 7.30pm, November 3.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Care Leavers' Association advocates radical change in the care system and stronger rights for care leavers.

  "<p>Global warming threatens to reverse human progress, and make unachievable all UN targets to reduce poverty, according to some of the world's leading international and development groups. </p> <p>In a report published today, Oxfam, Greenpeace, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth, WWF and 15 other groups say rich governments must immediately address climate change to avoid even \"obscene levels\" of worldwide poverty. </p> <p>\"Food production, water supplies, public health and people's livelihoods are already being damaged and undermined,\" the report says. \"There is no either/or approach possible. The world must meet its commitments to achieve poverty reduction and also tackle climate change. The two are inextricably linked.\" </p> <p>The report, which draws on UN predictions of the effects of climate change in poor countries over the next 50 years, says poor countries will experience more flooding, declining food production, more disease and the deterioration or extinction of entire ecosystems on which many of the world's poorest people depend. </p> <p>\"Climate change needs to be addressed now. The poor will bear the brunt of the impacts. The frontline experience of many of us working in international development indicates that communities are having to combat more extreme weather conditions.\" </p> <p>Climate change will play havoc with agriculture and water supplies and will increase diseases. \"By 2025 the proportion of the world's population living in countries of significant water stress will almost double, to 6 billion people. Tropical and sub-tropical areas will be hardest hit - those countries already suffering from food insecurity\". </p> <p>Poor communities mostly do not need hi-tech solutions, but would most benefit from education, research and being shown how to farm better. The report says unchecked global warming, more than wars or political upheaval, will displace millions of people and destabilise many countries.</p>",

  "<p>John Reid, the health secretary, yesterday appointed a new chief nursing officer for England and gave her responsibility for stepping up the drive against the hospital superbug MRSA. </p> <p>After 32 years in nursing, Chris Beasley, interim head of the NHS modernisation agency, took over as head of the profession with a seat on the health department's top board. She will spearhead the introduction of a \"matron's charter\" to improve hygiene standards. </p> <p>Mr Reid said the charter was \"a 21st century work plan for hospitals' cleanliness, based on a 19th century instruction from Florence Nightingale\". She established a founding principle of the modern profession when she said: \"Let whoever is in charge keep this simple question in her head, not 'How can I always do this right thing myself?' but 'How can I provide for this right thing to be always done?'\" </p> <p>Mr Reid said one of the rea sons for the growth in MRSA was a decision by the last Conservative government to contract out cleaning work, putting cheapness before cleanliness. The people doing the cleaning did not always feel part of the healthcare team. </p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I am not going to ban contracting out at the moment ... but if there is going to be a contract out-of-house, then the nursing staff must be involved in the drawing up of that contract so that there is clear control for clinical nursing staff on the ground.\" </p> <p>However, he acknowledged that hospital-acquired infections have affected 9% of patients for 50 years. The difference now was the danger posed by the MRSA superbug. </p> <p>According to official estimates, about 100,000 patients in England are affected by hospital-acquired infections each year, resulting in around 5,000 deaths. But last week the MRSA Support Group said the number of deaths was four times higher. </p> <p>The charter includes 10 pri orities for keeping hospitals clean. It said a patient's environment should be well-maintained, clean and safe, and cleaning staff should be made to feel part of the ward team. </p> <p>The charter was welcomed by nursing and midwifery unions. But the shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, said: \"Over the last seven years, rates of MRSA have doubled; 40% of the staphylococcus aureus bacteria in the UK is resistant to methicillin. This compares to 1% in the Netherlands. </p> <p>\"Four years ago, the National Audit Office highlighted the extent of the problems. Since then, the urgency with which this issue should have been addressed has been lacking.\" </p> <p>In a move that baffled officials at the Department of Health, Labour chose the day of the MRSA initiative to launch a pre-emptive election campaign strike against the \"Victor Meldrew\" strategy of the Conservatives to argue that Britain was getting worse, not better. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, a former health secretary, said: \"We will take on the politics of pessimism by winning back hope and confidence in Britain.\" Mr Milburn and his successor, John Reid, used improving outcomes in the NHS - from better cancer and heart attack survival rates to faster operations in brand new hospitals - to back their argument. </p> <p>But the message was complicated by claims from the Office for National Statistics that NHS productivity is still falling, despite the extra billions being spent.</p>",
  "Radical plans to replace existing secondary school exams in England with a new \"over-arching\" diploma were thrown into fresh confusion yesterday after the school standards minister, David Miliband, insisted that the names A-level and GCSE would survive. <p>His claim came as it emerged that Charles Clarke, the education secretary, has won a surprise parliamentary slot for a bill giving schools guaranteed three-year funding and a light touch by Ofsted, the independent school inspectorate. </p> <p>The education bill will implement parts of the government's five-year education plan, announced by Mr Clarke this summer. It will reach the statute book well before the 2005 election. </p> <p>Yesterday attention focused on continued confusion over the government's attitude to the long-awaited review led by the former chief inspector of schools Mike Tomlinson. On Monday he recommended that GCSEs, A-levels and other exams should become \"components\" within a new diploma, with those names eventually disappearing. </p> <p>But yesterday Mr Miliband stoked confusion at a London conference on the Tomlinson report, where he appeared alongside its author. Mr Miliband said the names A-level and GCSE would appear on the planned electronic transcript which will record students' exam results, claiming that that was explicitly stated in the report. </p> <p>Mr Tomlinson, however, said the names GCSE and A-level would go, replaced instead by the equivalent level - 2 for GCSE and 3 for A-level. \"It would leave the names off,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>Mr Miliband refused to be drawn about the government's official response, promising only that it would be a \"serious\" response in a January white paper. </p> <p>Mr Tomlinson also surprised teachers at the conference by saying that plans to stretch the brightest students by splitting the current A grade at A-level into three, with a further A+ and A++, were \"not set in concrete\". </p> <p>Mr Clarke is due to speak to the Local Government Association today, while the the government's election coordinator, Alan Milburn, and Mr Miliband will also defend the government's education record. </p> <p>As part of his determination to make the Queen's speech an integrated part of the election run-up, Mr Milburn is backing a series of strong domestic bills. </p> <p>The first of these will put in place three-year budgets giving every school guaranteed funding linked to pupil numbers. </p> <p>Ministers have also promised to halve the inspection burden through shorter, more frequent short-notice inspections. The proposals will match a green paper on inspection published a year ago. </p> <p>It is not clear how far the bill will also propose a reshaping of the relationship between local education authorities and schools. </p> <p>The existing five-year plan sets out a new but somewhat vague role for local authorities in which they recast themselves as the commissioner and quality assurer of educational services, not the direct supplier. </p> <p>Mr Milburn is said to be willing to look for something distinctively New Labour to clarify the dividing lines ahead of the election. </p> <p>The bill will be examined closely by local education authorities to see whether and how the funding arrangements weaken their role. </p> <p>Number 10 is also promoting a bill on antisocial behaviour, litter and on-the-spot fines that has been under preparation for years by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The bill will extend the range of offences subject to possible on-the-spot fines. </p> <p>But there is pressure from some close to Mr Milburn for the manifesto to go further in devolving power from traditional public service providers. <b>\u00b7</b> Chris Keates has been elected unopposed as the first woman general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, the second-largest teaching union.</p>",
  "Nanny is back. I don't mean that more people are employed in domestic service in the UK at the beginning of the 21st century than they were at the end of the 19th, which they are. Nor that Mary Poppins will soon be descending on the capital once more, this time in a West End musical, which she is. I mean the protests that we are becoming a nanny state are becoming more numerous by the day. <p>Nanny alerts are all over the place. Alan Milburn set one off by suggesting we should penalise those who fail to attend parenting, childcare or literacy programmes. God helps those who help themselves, but it is down to us to smite those who refuse to do so. </p> <p>The government is considering giving local authorities the power to ban smoking in public places. And although it doesn't seem to know what to do about the \"obesity epidemic\", other than give free fruit and vegetables to school children, it wants to do something. </p> <p>So terrifying is nanny that the brewing industry is voluntarily getting its house in order. The Yates chain now frowns on happy hours, while both Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Coors breweries are introducing responsible drinking warnings on their cans and bottles. </p> <p>Asda has even banned the sale of eggs to children in the run-up to Halloween, to stop the little dears using them as missiles. The litany of complaints could go on. They are all, however, thoroughly misguided. Sack nanny if you want, but someone has got to do her job. </p> <p>The problem with critics of the nanny state is that they mistakenly equate non-interference by government with freedom. They can't see beyond the surface of John Stuart Mill's maxim that the, \"only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.\" </p> <p>Too true. But who is harming who is precisely what is at issue. For instance, as an exhaustive study published this week shows, smoking in enclosed public spaces does harm others, in particular the people who work in bars and restaurants. The way in which the big breweries have been heavily discounting alcohol and encouraging bingeing through promotions and offers harms the health of the nation. Food manufacturers who put too much salt in their products contribute to heart disease. Welfare claimants who do nothing to improve their situation, even when help is offered, waste all our money. And, yes, if you sell eggs to a gang of kids who are evidently not going home to bake a cake, you are aiding and abetting their albeit minor misdemeanours. </p> <p>It is odd that those who instinctively feel uncomfortable with measures to mitigate these harms are often those who complain that large corporations have too much power. They queue to see Super Size Me and lament the insidious effects of McDonald's, but when the someone proposes doing something about it, their anti-corporate zeal vanishes. Perhaps they are persuaded that since no one is forcing you to eat, drink or smoke too much, individuals should be left to exercise their free will. </p> <p>This revered faculty seems to be considered inviolable, indivisible and pure. Any suggestion that it is not all it is cracked up to be is said to threaten the morality and dignity of the human race. Without free will we are no more than animals or robots. </p> <p>The obvious rejoinder is that we may actually be no more than animals or robots and that, if we are, getting upset about the fact isn't going to change the situation. </p> <p>Less facetiously, we should accept that freedom is not all or nothing. Our power to exercise our free will is limited and conditioned by the environment in which we find ourselves. Someone in the grip of an addiction has lost a considerable amount of their free will. We should accept that our power to choose freely is more subtly affected by the pressures society puts on us. We can only choose what is on offer, and we are all too susceptible to persuasion by people who conceal their own vested interests and don't have our best ones at heart. </p> <p>To maximise our freedom, therefore, we should be interested in creating a society in which we have the maximum power to make choices for ourselves. That may require us to limit the extent to which influences that are corrosive to freedom are allowed to operate. </p> <p>This is where the language of paternalism and the nanny state misleads us. It reflects an old-fashioned, deferential view of political power in which there is a great divide between the governed and the government. Rather, the government is ours, and we do not ask it to act like a parent to us, but to protect our interests in the ways wedemand. If they let us down, it is for us to chastise them, not vice versa. </p> <p>Of course, governments can go too far. Mill was right that no actions that harm only ourselves should be illegal. But there is a difference between regulation and banning outright. That is why there is no mixed message in calling for a lift on absolute prohibitions on illegal drugs, while at the same time legislating to encourage responsible drinking and coming down hard on those whose intoxication risks harm to others. Nor is the proposed increase in the number and size of casinos necessarily a bad thing, if it is matched by much stricter regulation of gambling, as promised. </p> <p>The Brits love to mock George W Bush's simplistic appeals to the virtues of freedom, but the truth is our notions of liberty are scarcely more sophisticated. In order to be truly free, both personally and politically, we need to mandate our freely elected representatives to control what companies and individuals can and cannot do. This is not hiring a nanny, it is looking after ourselves. </p> <p> <b> Britney's big break will do her good</b></p> <p>Britney Spears is to take a career break because she believes she has been naive and overexposed. Such a brutal, honest and frankly true self-assessment is remarkable but not unprecedented. Spears is, probably unwittingly, following in the footsteps of Estelle Morris, who resigned as education secretary because she didn't feel she was effective enough. </p> <p>Such candour is still the exception rather than the rule. After all, I don't recall Michael Winner refusing to shoot the Death Wish sequels because they frankly weren't ever going to be very good. Nor do I expect Prince Charles to announce that he is too flaky ever to become an effective king. As for the Pope admitting his fallibility, dream on. </p> <p>Some are of the view that it is good not to dwell on your imperfections. To be our best, we need to think ourselves the best. I am not convinced. I think we only become better by being honest about our own limitations, and then striving to overcome them. That's why I predict Britney's big break will do her good in the long run. Just don't expect me to quit if I'm wrong. Which I won't be, of course. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Julian Baggini is the author of What's It All About? Philosophy and the Meaning of Life, Granta Books.</p>",
  "The search for \"Mr Green\", the executive capable of leading London's fight against climate change, spanned several continents. Headhunters for the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, studied initiatives and applicants from the US, Canada, Australia and Europe. And then, in keeping with London's status as a major world city, they turned to the man from Woking. <p>Next year, when the mayor's new climate change agency begins operations, it will be led by Allan Jones, the expert credited with turning the Surrey town into a pioneering centre of energy efficiency. For \u00a390,000 a year, he is being told to replicate his achievements in Woking and to turn London into the \"green capital of Europe\". </p> <p>Mr Livingstone said: \"What Allan Jones has achieved in Woking is nothing short of revolutionary and I am delighted that he has agreed to take up the challenge of replicating what he achieved in one borough on London's world city-sized stage.</p> <p>\"Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the planet this century. Not only do large cities like London have a duty to reduce their carbon emissions, but, as Allan Jones has shown at Woking, becoming more energy efficient has the potential to save local authorities considerable sums of money. We will reinvest these savings in new renewable energy sources.\" </p> <p>Mr Jones said he was delighted to have secured a key role in London's effort to green itself and thought the Woking factor would be crucial. </p> <p>He first wrote a paper on global warming for the council 14 years ago. Using his expanded blueprint, it now saves an estimated \u00a3974,000 a year in bills. \"I believe that my experience at Woking borough council will help me to work with the private sector to deliver an enhanced energy infrastructure and to improve energy efficiency in new and existing buildings.\" </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that also playing a prominent role for the first six months of the agency's work will be Phil Jessup, a Canadian official who has led energy conservation work in Toronto. In his 2004 election manifesto, Mr Livingstone promised to make the need to tackle climate change a consistent theme during his second term. His deputy, Nicky Gavron, led a team which pulled together ideas for his climate change agency and considered candidates suitable to run it. </p> <p>While many international cities boasted admirable policies, the team discovered that Woking, with its 100,000 population, has undertaken groundbreaking work on energy and water efficiency, combined heat and power (CHP), alternative fuels for transport, fuel cells and renewable energy. It also contributed to Woking borough council gaining the Queen's award for enterprise for development of local sustainable community energy systems. </p> <p>Scattered across the borough are mini-power stations, district heating schemes and thousands of electricity-generating cells on roofs, all of which have made the borough a world leader in providing energy without relying on the national grid. The town centre, including the council offices and even the local Holiday Inn, is entirely energy self-sufficient. Surplus electricity is exported to other areas. </p> <p>The mayor's energy strategy has targets of a 20% reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 compared with 1990, and a 60% cut by 2050 compared with the levels recorded in 2000. </p> <p>Though the Green party criticised Mr Livingstone for doing too little for the green agenda in his first term, it is estimated that the congestion charge has reduced carbon dioxide emissions from traffic by 19%. Much of the focus now will be on buildings, the source of 70% of London's carbon dioxide emissions. New developments will be obliged to meet strict energy conservation requirements. </p> <p>The mayor now needs the support of the two Green party members in the London assembly to safeguard his administration's budget. </p> <p>Ms Gavron said: \"Climate change is moving centre stage, and if large cities like London cannot tackle it, how can others be expected to? We looked far and wide for someone to take this task on. Who would have thought we would end up 29 miles down the road?\"</p>",
  "<p>I once lived in a quiet village, astride a river, on the edge of a northern conurbation. Gradually, traffic levels rose as heavy lorries from a nearby quarry began using our through road as a handy \"ratrun\" to a main east-west route. Then, a mile away, a rather bland housing estate began to emerge - more, it seemed, by accident than by design. It grew and it grew, two-car households and more, as people moved from a nearby city to the countryside. </p> <p>Problem: how were residents supposed to reach their place of work in the city? No prizes for guessing. The result: traffic volume has increased considerably as the new, car-borne commuters make the slow crawl to the office. And it could get worse. Nearby stands a valuable piece of public land surrounding an old hospital, owned by the health service. It is one of scores of NHS sites around the country earmarked for redevelopment - that is, more housing - in a deal between the Department of Health and John Prescott's Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. </p> <p>But my experience pales into insignificance when set against plans for four big growth areas in the south-east and the east of England - the 40-mile Thames Gateway corridor east of London, a big expansion around Milton Keynes, and the development of the Stansted-M11 corridor on the Essex-Cambridge border. Last week's approval of 478,000 new homes by a regional planning panel - in spite of criticism by councils that the government-inspired plan rides roughshod over local democracy - underlines the dilemma. </p> <p>With sceptics arguing that the plan will place severe pressure on water resources, transport and the overall environment, it all seems a far cry from Prescott's vision, barely two years ago, of controlled and sensitive development. He wants well-designed townships, full of energy-efficient homes, built largely in factories and assembled quickly on site, served by new health centres, shops and other amenities, all with good bus and rail links to curb car dependency and reduce greenhouse gases. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister calls them \"sustainable communities\", and they don't come cheap. Prescott has railed against the growth of piecemeal estates around the country, with their anonymous, tawdry boxes - the kind of unplanned monstrosity on my doorstep - blotting the landscape, sometimes miles from anywhere, and truly \"unsustainable\". Not so long ago, he called for a new regime in which the \"predict and provide\" zealots in Whitehall - those who called for a building spree to meet a yet-to-be-determined need - were replaced by a more benign regime of \"plan, monitor and manage\". </p> <p>True, the deputy prime minister is championing the cause of emerging sustainable developments and new fast-track building techniques involving adventurous designs. But unless wiser counsels prevail, the reality is that building on the scale now envisaged will probably mean something very different: more estates plonked in green fields, with little thought of the long-term consequences for water supply, drainage and an already saturated road network. </p> <p>England faces three problems: the quality and design of new housing, the continued drift from conurbation to countryside throughout much of the country, and the over-concentration of new developments in the south and the east. While Prescott is making a little headway in addressing the first of these issues, the urban-rural exodus seems to be continuing, despite valiant strides in recycling old industrial land and in recolonising city centres. </p> <p>And the south and the east? Well, at last there are signs of serious questions being asked about the scale of the developments being proposed, and the need for them. This week, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), New Labour's favourite thinktank, said bluntly in a paper for a new independent commission for the south-east that the case for continued expansion of the region was wrong. Questioning the region's ability to handle further growth, it warned that the south should instead concentrate on coping with current pressures, from congestion and pollution to disparities within the region - and the lack of affordable housing. </p> <p>It also sought to demolish the argument of government agencies that further growth is needed for the region to compete with counterparts in mainland Europe. Using EU figures, the IPPR says the south-east is already on par with \"motor\" regions such as Bavaria and Baden-Wurtemberg in Germany and Lombardy in Italy - so why push for further expansion? On the wider front, this column has argued for some time that the overall development of England needs closer examination: the case for more growth in the south at the expense of a poorly performing north, with all the planning implications that throws up for the emerging growth areas. </p> <p>With the IPPR's commission providing a spurt, and with other initiatives addressing the \"English question\" about to take off, the state of this overcrowded country might even become an issue in the run-up to a likely general election in seven months' time. But maybe, on second thoughts, that's too much for short-termist politicians to digest. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hetherington is the Guardian's regional affairs editor.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps only a social worker could mourn the passing of a maroon Citroen 2CV. \"I called it Claud and I loved it,\" says Rachel Culley. \"One day it just died. Unfortunately, you can't get them any more. I now lease something sensible, like a Rover. When I had the 2CV, I used to wear flowing ethnic clothes. The kids thought it was hilarious.\" So did Claud have a CND sticker on his/its back window? \"No, but there was one urging people in the car behind to Foster For Coventry,\" says Culley, 49, who is part of the city's permanency team, working with children for whom the plan is adoption. </p> <p>\"The thing about two-door cars like that,\" grins her colleague, Jim McDaid, \"is that they make it more difficult for kids to jump out.\" McDaid, 52, works in the mental health team in a deprived sector of the city - today he's wearing a faded denim jacket over a green polo shirt: \"I've got a couple of duffel coats as well. In the summer I sometimes wear sandals. No socks, mind you.\" </p> <p>Needless to say, there is a certain amount of self-parody going on among this group of vastly experienced workers gathered at a table in Coventry's social services department. They're aware their profession is portrayed by such luminaries as the Daily Mail's Keith Waterhouse as full of people with woolly hats pulled over heads full of woolly ideas. Also that established soap operas like EastEnders perpetuate the stereotype of social workers as politically correct busybodies. </p> <p>The good-humoured response among these foot soldiers in the battle to ease the pressures on damaged and deprived people belies the earnestness that comes with that stereotype.Yet there is some underlying concern that negative images undermine their work. A recent survey of 1,000 people across England found that more than half understood little or nothing about what social work involves. Which hardly surprises Kath Evans, 56, a member of Coventry's children's disability team. \"We are invisible until something awful happens,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Attitudes are based on what the public read. Sometimes you have to get over a barrier of perception before you can help. Clients can be very anxious about what we're up to because their image of us is based on the press we get. We need something to counter that, because we do a lot of good work and I do feel that the difficult decisions we make, and the responsibilities we feel, are not recognised. Maybe there should be a series of television adverts, like the ones for the police where the viewer was asked: 'Could you do this job?'\" </p> <p>And maybe, I tentatively suggest to McDaid, some social workers might get more respect if they turned out in smarter, more professional-looking clothes. He shrugs: \"If I put on a suit in the area where I work, they'd think I was a policeman. So I dress down.\" Like the drugs squad? \"Yes, except that the drugs squad look as though they've just come off the dance floor. Actually, there's a young chap I work with who dresses smartly in the modern idiom. I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.\" </p> <p>In some professions, younger practitioners are pushing for an ever-more-casual approach to dress at work. In social work, it is the other way around. \"Certainly the hippy image was more prevalent in the early 1970s when I started,\" recalls John Bolton, Coventry's director of social services, whose office is just down the corridor. </p> <p>Paradoxically, he feels the profession had more respect from the public in those days: \"Mind you, there were exceptions. My first job as a young social worker was to approach a woman in a mining village who was looking after a friend's children. I had to register her as a carer, but I was a bit taken aback when she opened the door and said: 'What the eff do you want? It's none of your effing business.' After a while, she said: 'I suppose you want an effing cup of tea'. She then put a teabag in a pot and ran some water over it, straight out of the hot tap. I felt obliged to drink it.\" </p> <p>Exceptions apart, how did perceptions change so much that polls now put the public esteem of social workers not only below that of nurses and police officers, but also that of teachers? </p> <p>From Maria Colwell, in 1973, to Victoria Climbi\u00e9 and beyond, over 30 years of irregular yet horrific child-abuse cases have taken their toll. The media have lashed around for somebody or some body to carry the can. Directors of social services have sweated under TV lights, blinking at flashbulbs as they explain how staff missed clues which now seem obvious. </p> <p>\"Social workers are mostly portrayed in the media for their failings,\" says Bolton. \"Yet every day they're making a really big difference to people's lives. The vast majority of the public, however, don't come into contact with social services unless their parents need help or they have a serious accident. And even then it doesn't necessarily follow. </p> <p>\"The other day, I came across a wheelchair user who was managing perfectly well with the help of her husband and a neighbour. When the husband ran off with the neighbour, who was there to pick up the pieces? She was effusive about the way my staff had rallied round to help her.\" </p> <p>It sounds like a soap-opera storyline. Wouldn't a soap give the public a more rounded view of what social workers do? \"I'm not sure,\" says Bolton. \"There are more than enough TV series about the police, but the images are negative as well as positive.\" </p> <p>Round the corner from Bolton's office, at Coventry University, third-year social work student Denise Marshall, 36, has had the sort of life that could transfer to the small screen. In her late teens and early 20s, she worked as a \"blagger\" on nightclub doors in Benidorm. \"It was my job to talk people into the club. I've always been a good talker - and listener - but, in the course of that job I was assaulted and thrown over a table. A great learning experience for being a social worker, don't you think?\" she asks, eyes twinkling. </p> <p>Despite her background as a seeker of sun and fun, Marshall hasn't been put off by social work's less-than-glamorous image. Nor have colleagues on the three-year BA course which is now the standard qualification for the profession. \"In my community [Pakistani] it's a very highly esteemed job,\" says Ansar Alam, 32. For a Muslim, it seems, \"do-gooder\" is not a term of derision. \"If you look into our religion, it's about trying to help people. In fact, the only member of my family who didn't want me to do this was my husband. But, because he loves me, he agreed to support me. I've shared a lot of the work with him, and he's so impressed that he's considering doing this course himself.\" </p> <p>Among those graduating at the end of this year will be Nansi Ellis, 39, who decided to train as a social worker after years as a personnel officer at Land Rover: \"In a big company, it's all about chasing the next salary cheque. I remember feeling particularly disillusioned by the company's so-called 'diversity training' on issues of race and disability. It was just a cynical exercise in getting boxes ticked so that you could move up the career ladder. Out of 40 people on the session I attended, there were three women and nobody with a disability. The vast majority were able-bodied white guys in their 30s. All in sharp suits.\" </p> <p>Not a denim jacket or a duffel coat between them. </p> <p><strong>The own goal of no comment</strong></p> <p>Social workers complain about being sterotyped by the media, but do they, in turn, stereotype the media as being universally against them? </p> <p>Freelance journalist Allister Craddock, until recently a producer of documentaries for Carlton Television, has seen enough of the terrain in which social workers operate to empathise with the difficulties they face. </p> <p>\"The cases they have to deal with involve extreme deprivation and anger,\" he says. \"Somehow they have to steer a path through that. It's the kind of job that most people wouldn't want to do for half an hour.\" But Craddock also feels that social services departments do themselves no favours when it comes to dealing with media queries. \"There's a feeling that they'd be betraying a client's interest by saying anything whatsoever,\" he says. \"That becomes a cast-iron, unbreakable commitment. </p> <p>\"It can be frustrating for a journalist because you know you may be getting only a part of a complicated story. Allegations are made and all we get back from local authority press offices is 'no comment'.\"</p>",
  "<p>The tension was tangible in committee room one as the debate on the great white shark intensified. Australia and Madagascar were leading the campaign to have the predator listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). Even though they had no idea of the species' global population, they quoted credible academic research that suggested numbers had declined by between 60% and 95% over the past few decades. </p> <p>Fighting against the move to place tight controls on trade in sharks was Japan, supported by its whaling partners and vassal states. They argued that, as it was impossible to calculate the species' population, it was impossible to assess the threat to it from trade. </p> <p>The conservationists need not have worried. The proposal was passed overwhelmingly and, for the first time at the biannual conference, this year attended by 166 nations and 150 other organisations, a round of applause rippled round the convention centre in the Thai capital of Bangkok. </p> <p>As with equally important but less controversial decisions taken to protect the humphead wrasse and to limit trade in the tropical hardwood ramin, the ramifications went far beyond the likely survival of these three high-profile species. The moves sent a strong signal that Cites is determined to extend its area of interest from traditional land-based fauna to high-profile, commercially-sensitive marine and timber species. </p> <p>\"If Cites cannot get to grips with timber and fisheries and play an appropriate role, it's not facing up to its mandate,\" said Steven Broad, the executive director of Traffic International, an organisation that monitors the global wildlife trade. </p> <p>Julian Newman, of the Environmental Investigation Agency, which has done a lot of work on the illegal trade in ramin - a wood used often for blinds, pool cues and baby cots - says this conference has marked a turning point in the global awareness of the convention. \"Usually, the timber industry has very entrenched interests,\" he says. \"But countries are now recognising that Cites can play a role in controlling the illegal trade in timber.\" </p> <p>The big \"but\", according to Newman and many others, is that committee-room victories are meaningless without effective enforcement of decisions. And that, as Thailand's prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, pointed out in his speech, is still a distant dream. \"Globally, the illegal trading in wildlife, timber and other natural resources is now surpassed only by the trafficking in drugs and weapons,\" Shinawatra said. </p> <p>\"To make matters worse, it has been found that criminal elements involved in conventional forms of organised crime are often linked to this illegal trade in wildlife and timber.\" </p> <p>\"There aren't many customs or police here,\" said John Parr, conservation director of WWF Thailand. \"We should be promoting a Cites unit within Customs or the police because they are a lot more powerful than the Cites management authorities. All we need is two or three people [in each country] being given a mandate to focus on wildlife. It would then snowball.\" </p> <p>Enforcement did get much more attention than at past conferences. South-east Asia states led with an announcement that they would form a regional action plan on the enforcement of trade regulations in wild fauna and flora. </p> <p>One issue that needs addressing, according to Broad, is the severity of sentences for wildlife crimes. China, he said, sometimes uses the death penalty, while Singapore usually issues a small fine. \"The stakes are very high,\" he said. \"For example, toothfish smugglers can lose one ship and not be concerned, if two others get through.\" </p> <p>The other main theme of the conference was that conservation appears to be gaining the upper hand over the traders. \"The general trend is more conservation minded,\" said Peter Pueschel, head of the large International Fund for Animal Welfare delegation. \"There have also been a lot of decisions not in the public eye but which are also very important, such as attempts to help [enforcement] capacity building.\" </p> <p>Broad agrees, and believes the balance between trade and conservation is now about right. \"Cites is lobbied by both sides and it needs to be,\" he says. \"It's one of its strengths because you can't realistically pretend this is not about trade. It has to deal with that, and also needs to do more to engage the private sector, from both sides.\" </p> <p>But although Cites secretary-general Willem Wijnstekers described the conference as \"certainly among the best meetings ... we've ever had\", and most participating groups agreed, conservation did not win every battle. Many conservationists were upset that, in the final plenary session, the parties agreed to clamp down on illegal trade in African elephant ivory, but also voted to give Namibia permission to sell traditional ivory carvings - known as ekipas - as tourist souvenirs under strictly controlled conditions. \"People don't read the fine print,\" said Pueschel. \"The message that sinks in is that ivory trade is allowed.\" </p> <p>Other disappointments were that the budget was slashed by some 7%, which is likely to impact hardest on enforcement capacity building in developing countries, according to Wijnstekers. </p> <p>As delegates left the plenary, with more of a spring in their step than expected, some people injected a note of caution. \"Our question is what will the situation be in six months, after the spotlight has moved,\" Broad said. </p> <p><strong>Cites highlights</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trade in species listed on Appendix I is banned. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trade in species listed on Appendix II subject to extremely tight controls. </p> <p><strong> Key decisions:</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Species added to Appendix I: Irrawaddy dolphin; Manambe palm; Lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo; Lilac-crowned parrot. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some of the species added to Appendix II: great white shark; humphead wrasse; ramin; agarwood; several turtle species; leaf-tailed gecko; Mediterranean date mussel. </p> <p><strong> Other decisions:</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Japan's attempt to have the minke whale downlisted failed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Namibia and South Africa each given an export quota of five black rhinoceros hunting trophies. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Adoption of an action plan to clamp down on unregulated African ivory markets. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Namibia defeated in its attempt to secure an annual export quota of two tonnes of raw ivory. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Secretariat's budget cut by 7%. Likely to have greatest impact on enforcement capacity-building in developing countries. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> South-east Asian nations announce joint enforcement plan to tackle nature crimes - the first such scheme of its kind. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cites brought closer into line with the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the Convention on Biodiversity.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Majority view</strong><br> </p> <p>Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, claims that his proposals for change have the support of the majority of the membership (Wringing the changes, October 13). How does he know, when the membership are refused a vote? And how does he expect active and successful branches such as mine to support his proposals when he sends me an email saying: \"Because these proposals have to be effective for branches that are struggling, it is likely they will cause most problems for branches that are working very effectively\"?<br> <strong>Alan Fowler</strong> <br> Chairman, Alzheimer's Society, Winchester &amp; district branch </p> <p><strong> Policy debate</strong><br> </p> <p>Much has been written of the desirability of individuals making provision for the care needs of themselves and their dependants in old age (Opinion, October 13). Accordingly, in 1996 I invested \u00a310,000 of savings in a Long Term Care Bond promoted by a reputable company (Scottish Amicable, since taken over by Prudential), the declared purpose of which was \"to provide the chosen level of care throughout the insured individual's [my wife's] life\" in the event of my predeceasing her. </p> <p>In June this year, however, she was informed by the company that such cover could expire on her reaching 84 years of age - even if no claim had been made before that date - and no rebate would be forthcoming. Clearly if, as has been mooted, such provision is to be encouraged by government, it is essential legislation to ensure genuine life-long cover is available. My experience also emphasises the importance of carefully reading the small print of such policies. <br> <strong>Bob Heyes</strong><br> Halifax </p> <p><strong> Power struggle</strong><br> </p> <p>I'm sure that it is the case that Tory and LibDem voters in Leeds did not support either party in June with a view to them propping up a Labour administration (Leeds united, October 13). I can see that it makes sense, then, for them to prop each other up, even if this does bring into question the sometime LibDem profile of being to the left of Blair. </p> <p>Your article also mentions, but does not explain, that the Greens are part of the ruling group. I would very much like to know why, especially since they are not holding the balance of power. </p> <p>I have, over the years, voted Green on occasion, but I would think hard about doing so if I thought the result would be a Tory or LibDem administration. <br> <strong>Keith Flett</strong> <br> London </p> <p><strong> Join the club</strong><br> </p> <p> I read with interest, but not agreement, David Brindle's piece on car ownership (Opinion, October 6). I do agree that flexibility is needed; however, that can be achieved much more effectively by the introduction of car clubs. We have a rapidly growing scheme of this type in Brighton and Hove. </p> <p>It means that those who do not have a car could have access for times of need, and those who presently own a car could dispose of it. After all, most people do not use a car 24 hours a day, so people such as the shift workers cited by Brindle would be able to have access to a car during the antisocial hours during which they are employed. </p> <p>It is much cheaper than car owner ship, avoids the \"dead space\" of cars clogging up the streets in congested areas, and, most important of all, studies show that those who join a car club are much more likely to mix and match their transport modes, thus leading to a reduction in pollution and CO2 emissions. <br> <strong>Councillor Joyce Edmond-Smith</strong> <br> Convenor, Sustainability Commission, Brighton &amp; Hove city council </p> <p><strong> Burden of care</strong><br> </p> <p> The story of Andrew Entwistle is a touching one but leaves a great deal unsaid (Men about the house, October 6). </p> <p>In the piece, we are told nothing of any attempts to obtain care for his mother at home. Nursing and care agencies do exist that could have taken the burden off him for at least part of the day. Such care agencies do not, of course, come cheap. For example, the typical cost in London is \u00a315 per hour, which adds up to \u00a3600 per five-day week for an eight-hour day. </p> <p>Entwistle presumably receives attendance allowance. He can apply for \"direct payments\" from his local authority. Unfortunately, the Act of Parliament is highly ambiguous, stating that patients must be capable of managing direct payments either themselves or \"with such assistance as may be available\". </p> <p>Local authorities interpret this in a wide variety of ways. Some carers have obtained these funds without difficulty, while one had to go as far as the ombudsman to obtain financial support. </p> <p>Carers have enough problems without having to contend with gross inconsistencies in policy. Information on one's rights is also hard to get. These matters need urgent attention. <br> <strong>Duncan Hutchison</strong><br> London </p> <p><strong> Natural solution</strong><br> </p> <p>George Monbiot omits one of the most powerful arguments for wind power (Blow by blow, October 6). </p> <p>If, or when, we have finished with a wind turbine, it can be taken down. The hole for the foundation is rather big, but the soil that came out of it can be replaced, thus restoring the ground to its original use. You can't say that of a nuclear power station. <br> <strong>Tim Gossling</strong><br> Cambridge</p>",
  "At Murghob, near the Chinese border between Akbaytal and Tukhmtamish in the mountainous east of Kyrgyzstan, yak herders were thinking it. <p>The same thought was crossing the minds of dried-mango producers in Burkina Faso, monastic brewers in Belgium and poultry farmers in Guatemala, while in the vast expanses of a royal palace in London, it will have entered the head of a familiar figure with an affable, eternally bewildered, smile. </p> <p>The thought is - or was - \"Time to go to Turin\". </p> <p>For the next three days, the old capital of Piedmont is hosting a conference of a reach and scale normally attempted only by the UN and other big international organisations. More than 4,000 representatives of communities producing high-qual ity foods in more than 100 countries are to come together for what has been described as the gourmet community's equivalent of a world social forum. </p> <p>Prince Charles will be addressing the final plenary session on Saturday. Other British participants include sea-salt manufacturers from Anglesey, Cornish fishermen, Cheddar cheese makers from Somerset and farmers rearing Herdwick sheep in the Lake District. </p> <p>Unlike other monster global congresses, Terra Madre, as it has been entitled, is the brainchild of one man - Carlo Petrini, the ebullient founder of the Slow Food movement. Since 1986, when it was created to protest at the opening of a McDonald's in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, Slow Food has itself grown into something of an international organisation, acquiring 80,000 members along the way. </p> <p>But Terra Madre is in a quite different category from anything it has so far attempted. Just tracing and contacting the participants was a vast challenge. Thousands of emails were dispatched, and Slow Food tapped into the representation abroad of both the Italian government and the Vatican. </p> <p>\"One of the problems was that a lot of these people didn't have passports. So we'd set about arranging that, and then we'd discover that they didn't have the documents they needed to get a passport,\" says Cinzia Scaffidi, one of the principal organisers of the event. \"There was one group of indigenous people from Brazil who wouldn't have their photos taken either. We asked why and were told they were afraid it would rob them of their souls.\" </p> <p>Accommodating the participants in and around Turin was another nightmare. Some are being put up in the city itself: in hotels, guest houses, religious institutions and the private homes of Torinese who have come forward to offer hospitality. But others are being lodged as far away as the Val d'Aosta, the French-speaking region in the Alps. Between these two extremes, hundreds of visitors have been found places to sleep in the homes of Piedmontese farmers, Ligurian fishermen and others involved in the food business in north-western Italy. </p> <p>Care has been taken to avoid diplomatic incidents by ensuring, for example, that Serbs are not put under the same roof as Albanians. In some cases, the idea has been to match the hosts with the guests. Thus, a party of Russian fisherwomen has been lodged at Noli on the Mediterranean coast. In other cases, there is a distinct hint of mischievous provocation. Fifty hearty brewers from around the world have been found places in the classy wine-growing area of the Langhe. </p> <p>During the conference itself, between the opening and closing plenary sessions, the plan is for participants to join specialist groups discussing a vast range of subjects, from honey-making techniques to farming in volcanic areas and high-altitude agriculture to pest management. So that they can understand each other, the discussions are to be interpreted simultaneously into seven languages (though whether that will be enough for the contributions of, say, Afghan raisin producers, remains to be seen). </p> <p>So who is funding this remarkable extravaganza? The answer, it turns out, is the taxpayers of Italy in general, and Piedmont in particular. </p> <p>According to Slow Food, the cash cost will be \u20ac2.6m (\u00a31.8m). Notwithstanding the fact that Italy is meant to be struggling to keep its budget deficit within agreed EU limits, the agriculture ministry in Rome has seen fit to put in \u20ac1.8m of that, with the regional government of Piedmont stumping up a further \u20ac600,000. In addition, there is a cost in kind to the local authority in Turin that is reckoned at \u20ac1m. </p> <p>What makes this all the more remarkable is that the bodies providing the cash funding are run, not by the left, but the right. When Petrini stands up tonight to open Terra Madre, he will be flanked by the governor of Piedmont, Enzo Ghigo, who belongs to Silvio Berlusconi's neo-liberal Forza Italia movement, and Italy's agriculture minister, Giovanni Alemanno, of the \"post-fascist\" National Alliance. </p> <p>These are not the sort of people you expect to be backing a project which, in Petrini's words, aims to help create a \"new planetary consciousness\". </p> <p>Part of the explanation for their odd partnership with the left-leaning Petrini lies in the broader strategy of the Berlusconi government, which is to promote Italy as a centre of gastronomic and agricultural excellence. Italians are still much closer to their rural past than, say, the British, and politicians and officials can see that their reluctance to depart from tradition, which is holding Italy back in many other spheres, offers considerable benefits when it comes to the production and preparation of quality foods. </p> <p>Italy's Eurocrats lobbied furiously to get the new European Food Safety Agency headquartered in Parma, and the government has provided enthusiastic backing for a wide range of other initiatives, including Slow Food's foundation of a university of gastronomy near Turin. </p> <p>Along the way, key figures on the Italian right seem to have been persuaded that, if they are to turn the country into a paragon of nutritional integrity, they are going to have to embrace causes normally associated with the left. This intriguing turnaround is most strikingly obvious with respect to genetically modified seeds. </p> <p>Piedmont's governor, Enzo Ghigo, last year ordered the destruction of all the GM crops that had been planted in his region and tomorrow, the hard-right agriculture minister, Giovanni Alemanno, is hoping to get through cabinet an administrative order imposing severe curbs on future planting of GM seeds. </p> <p>Terra Madre has unquestionably helped to consolidate a remarkable alliance across the usual political boundaries. But what exactly is it? The starting point for a new global movement? Or a pretentious, if well-intentioned, initiative by middle-class foodies hopelessly out of touch with the harsh realities of country life? </p> <p>Petrini does himself no favours on that score when he describes conference participants as \"intellectuals of the earth and sea\". Nevertheless, the thinking behind Terra Madre departs from the fact that Slow Food and other similar organisations are indeed overwhelmingly clubs for prosperous food lovers from the developed world. </p> <p>Petrini sees a danger that, \"We all become top-class gourmets and connoisseurs of rare delicacies while ignoring the need to prevent the disappearance of those who actually work the land and supply the products.\" To that extent, the venture has an element of self-interest. But Petrini's aim is to use Terra Madre for the creation of a series of new networks that will allow producers from the developing world to swap information among themselves and provide them with access to the technical expertise and marketing opportunities available in the richer north. </p> <p>\"The important thing about Terra Madre is not really what happens during the conference, but what happens afterwards when people go back to their villages,\" he says. \"My hope is that they become involved in effective networks and that, having attended Terra Madre and met other people in similar situations, they will feel less lonely.\" </p> <p>Everyone attending the conference will get a directory containing the names and contact details of all the participants. \"They will take this book away with them, and I hope they use it,\" says Petrini. </p> <p>It takes a stretch of the imagination, perhaps, to envisage Madagascan zebu herders swapping emails with Bulgarian pig farmers, but in the age of the internet anything is possible. Slow Food has already had experience of how a lit tle expert knowledge can transform the prospects of poor food producers. </p> <p>In the 1990s, a Moroccan university teacher helped set up a women's cooperative in the south of the country to produce oil from the argan or Moroccan ironwood tree, a plant that is thought to have medicinal properties and has caught the fancy of top chefs as far away as the US. </p> <p>The women found, however, that the oil went off quickly when stored. Through Slow Food's mediation, two Italian experts were dispatched to Morocco where they found that the answer was to store the oil in metal, rather than plastic, containers or in bottles made of dark glass. </p> <p>\"That is an example of the kind of cross-fertilisation we are hoping will come out of Terra Madre,\" said a Slow Food spokeswoman, Alessandra Abbona. </p> <p>Though Petrini has always tried to distance himself from the overtly political agenda of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, the French anti-globalisation activist, it is quite clear that with Terra Madre he is nudging the movement he created a step closer to the anti-globalisation camp. He describes the people he is seeking to help as, \"Those who feel the repercussions, all too often negative, of the decisions taken in the international headquarters of WTO, the IMF and the World Bank\". His aim is to, \"create a counter-trend to that which the world believes is inevitable\". </p> <p>He adds: \"It may be a dream. But I have always believed in the idea that he who sows utopias, harvests realities.\"</p>",
  "<p>In her book, Another World is Possible if ..., Susan George, key thinker of the global justice movement (she thinks the term \"anti-globalisation\" is inaccurate and a bit demeaning, because the movement is proposing a more just, equitable and sustainable version of international co-operation), argues that knowledge and understanding must be key components of building a movement for social change. The world is complicated, the causes of human hardship are increasingly harder to understand, let alone challenge, good knowledge is crucial to making good political choices. </p> <p>Not much here that those of us who work in education could disagree with - because, regardless of political affiliation, we tend to agree with Ms George that we have a special and central role in shaping the world. If nothing else, more education certainly gives you a sense of self-importance.</p> <p>\"The global social justice movement seems to have a disproportionate number of educators in its ranks, which is an excellent thing because teachers and academics have particularly serious responsibilities for world-changing,\" she says in her book. </p> <p>In fact, Ms George is a bit scolding when she writes about the role of educators. Institutional pressures, the imperatives of career building, the difficulty of getting a permanent job and the suspicion of unorthodox ways of thinking and writing - all of this militates against academics playing a useful role in understanding and changing our world. We are too busy trying to gain favour and recognition within our disciplines and from our higher-ups to risk writing anything that ordinary people might want to read. </p> <p>Playing within the rules of the university is more likely to make us into barriers to social change - protecting and measuring our specialisms for the purposes of ratings and funding, but shying away from anything as controversial as accessible political education. Properly told off, and like a lot of other educators, I trekked off to Alexandra Palace to see what I could learn and unlearn. </p> <p>In the end, the European Social Forum last weekend proved to be slightly alarming, yet oddly familiar. I'm not so good with crowds and noise - of course preferring the calm and sobriety of library and senior common room - and such a concentrated collection of long lost friends and half-forgotten enemies brought out my worst anti-social tendencies. At the same time, the whole event was reminiscent of large academic conferences with endless parallel sessions and many delegates lost in transit and content to hang out in the spaces in between. So although I am glad I went, I am more glad it is over and there is space again to think about every day campaigning and education without the hurly-burly of the fair.</p> <p>Of course, it is partly my own fault for not being involved in the planning and instead waiting to be told how my various affiliations might want to use the event. And I did see some actual dialogue, some of which was seriously strange - my favourite head-imploding moment coming when the speaker berated the Trotskyist left for confusing genuine national liberation movements and the counter-revolutionary forces of Hungary in 1956 and, over time, contributing to the destruction of the glorious revolutionary example of the Soviet Union, a tirade that was met with remarkable good humour from other speakers and much hilarity from the audience. </p> <p>But mainly the event seemed to be a lot of very old-style meetings all at once, with endless speakers and questions from the floor that turned out to be yet more speeches. Overall, and not for the first time, I came away convinced that we really need to find other ways of speaking to each other. </p> <p>In this vein, one of my favourite lessons in how to learn came from Tariq Ramadan, a leading Islamic scholar who has been denied his visa to take up an academic position in the US.</p> <p>Professor Ramadan, who has become something of a pin-up for the promotion of inter-cultural dialogue, stressed the need to avoid confusing a global movement for social justice with a standardised movement that saw one solution for all. And although this can be hard terrain right now, he gave a pretty engaging, not to mention charming, account of how we must learn from and listen to each other. The prevailing climate of anxiety around security has created a psychology of fear in the population at large, exacerbating divisions and suspicions - so dialogue is difficult, but urgently necessary.</p> <p>Professor Ramadan argued that there is a lack of mutual trust in the way different communities live together - and for those interested in social justice this raised the question of how we can understand that; although we don't come from the same background, we can have common values. Such an understanding must recognise that we share the same values and principles - but not the same models for achieving these goals. As an example, he cited his own work as an attempt to create a liberation theology coming out of the Islamic world, a theology that could come with a global social justice perspective and be grounded within the traditions and histories of the Islamic world - something that contemporary western perspectives seem unable to imagine. Even within the ESF, he suggested, there were some simplistic ways of thinking about others (my sister tells me that at another meeting someone from the floor tried to shout him off the stage). Much better to stretch and to respect each other's complexity. Hard ideas lucidly expressed, and with some laughs along the way. I'm using him as my role model to become a less shameful type of educator.</p>"
