  "David Hope, the retiring Archbishop of York, the number two in the hierarchy of the Church of England, spoke yesterday of his despair at the rancour in the Anglican communion over the gay issue which is dragging the church apart. <p>The archbishop, himself once the target of a campaign by the gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, told the Guardian of the \"cacophony of factions\" which is distracting the church from its historic mission. </p> <p>Dr Hope is retiring in February at the age of 64 - six years early - in order to return to being a vicar in Ilkley. He has made little secret of his frustration over the church's political infighting. </p> <p>Speaking in the study of the archbishops' medieval palace by the banks of the river Ouse outside York, he called for Christians to honour diversity and difference and to behave more charitably towards their opponents. \"We have to keep batting for that. I must admit I have felt at times that there is no point in going on, I have felt ground down and helpless. There is a time to speak and a time to listen, and sometimes people need to shut up.\" </p> <p>The archbishop's remarks followed comments by Phillip Jensen, the hardline dean of Sydney, who told a conference of conservative evangelicals in Derbyshire recently that Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was guilty of \"total prostitution of the Christian ministry\" and should resign because he holds tolerant private views of homosexuality while upholding the church's official policy that active gays are not permissible in the ordained ministry. </p> <p>Dr Hope said: \"You almost despair when you hear people commenting in that way. The sense of the spirit is singularly lacking. That was an outrageous thing to say. I have the highest regard for the Archbishop of Canterbury. He has enormous qualities and huge spiritual depth. I have been privy to some of the things that have pressed down on him but he has great resilience.\" </p> <p>Some conservative evangelicals reacted angrily when Dr Hope warned them at a conference a year ago that their rancorousness towards Dr Williams and over the gay issue was turning off other Christians. Although he was applauded at the time, evangelical pressure groups later concluded that inviting him to speak was a mistake. </p> <p>Senior churchmen believe that the 77 million-strong worldwide communion may split over homosexuality because divisions are becoming increasingly entrenched between liberals in the western churches in England and North America, who believe that biblical injunctions against homosexuality need to be reinterpreted in the light of modern psychological understanding, and conservatives and traditionalists particularly in the developing world who say there can be no retreat from biblical condemnation. </p> <p>The report of a commission two weeks ago recommended expressions of regret on both sides and the eventual establishment of a framework of authority across the communion. </p> <p>Dr Hope said: \"I don't think in the short term they can be reconciled. Clearly the report contains elements that are very substantial and compelling but the question is, how do you translate that into practicalities? Are people desirous of seeking a way forward or are they just looking for further division? </p> <p><b> Hounded</b><br> </p> <p>\"I would like to think people have looked down into the abyss and will now work with the grain of the report. Maybe we will have to live in impaired communion for the time being. I doubt whether it will be solved in my lifetime. </p> <p>\"There is a cacophony of factions drowning out the Good News of Jesus Christ. We have got world problems of poverty, hunger, Aids, the war in Iraq, the environment - large questions - and here we are, almost preoccupied with the gay issue. We need to look beyond ourselves.\" </p> <p>The issue has hounded and intruded on Dr Hope almost throughout his ministry. Unmarried, a priest in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, in the 1970s he was called in to impose discipline on the exceedingly camp high church training college at St Stephen's House in Oxford. On the other hand, Jeffrey John, the celibate gay theologian briefly appointed bishop of Reading last year, who was one of Dr Hope's students at Oxford, has spoken of his support when he told him he was gay. Yesterday, Dr Hope said of John's ordeal over the Reading post: \"I felt very strongly for him.\" </p> <p>In 1995, when Dr Hope was Bishop of London, he reacted to a letter from Peter Tatchell, calling on him to out himself as gay, by publishing the letter and denouncing the activist's attempted intimidation. It was a brave stand and prompted his concession that his sexuality was a grey area. He said yesterday: \"I felt it was bullying. It was misplaced and misjudged. The sort of things he wrote to me were intimidatory. My remark just came out. It was one of those things, not premeditated.\" </p> <p>Potentially as divisive of the Church of England is the issue of whether women, who have now been ordained to the clergy for more than a decade, should be allowed to proceed to the episcopacy. A report to be published today of yet another church committee will outline a number of options for making women bishops and dealing with the ongoing opposition. </p> <p>Dr Hope continues to oppose women's ordination as a breach with the universal church's traditions. He believes the Church of England fudged the issue of the episcopacy when it made the decision to allow women to become priests in 1992. </p> <p>\"The question of whether women should be made bishops once they had been ordained is absolutely pivotal. It seems to me absolute nonsense for women to be ordained to the priesthood but not to the episcopacy because the two are inextricably linked. It seems to be an inevitability. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest [one of the report's recommendations] that women could become suffragans but not diocesans. In principle there could be the possibility of a woman archbishop.\" </p> <p>To safeguard the position of priests like him who could not accept such a development, the archbishop talks of extending the church's principle of alternative episcopal oversight - allowing parishes which cannot accept women clergy to have administration from like-minded bishops. </p> <p>He would not support a breakaway, nor consider leaving the church: \"Not at the moment. That is not an option. It depends what the alternatives are. I don't see any point in forming a breakaway church on one issue, whether it is over gays, or women.\" </p> <p>The former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, found himself in hot water when he became the first archbishop to publish his memoirs last summer. The most David Hope has authorised is a gossipy memoir by his long-serving press officer, the Rev Rob Marshall, to be published this month. </p> <p>So no intention for an autobiography then? \"No. All that stuff about who said what to who is not for me. I think silence is probably the best way forward, at least for the time being. For the first 12 months certainly there's going to be no writing. After that, watch this space.\"</p> <p><b>Life in short</b><br> Age: 64, son of a builder and a schoolteacher. </p> <p>First church post as choirboy, Wakefield Cathedral - 30 years later returned as Bishop of Wakefield, for six years from 1985 (youngest diocesan bishop in the Church of England on appointment). </p> <p>After ordination in 1966, first parishes were in Liverpool and Warrington. Sent in to sort out his old theology college as principal of St Stephen's House, Oxford,1974-82; then vicar of ultra-high church All Saints, Margaret Street, London; returned from Wakefield to take up post as Bishop of London, 1991-95. Returned to his beloved Yorkshire as Archbishop of York in 1995. </p> <p>Twin sister Anne: \"David used to take services for the family. We all used to sit in the attic room and he would be the vicar. We used to have hymns and he would preach. Yes, at 11 ... and, believe it or not, he had a collection.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hope the Archbishop, by Rob Marshall, Continuum, \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "Justice Bekebeke is no stranger to long lines of voters at polling stations, angrily committed to making their vote count. <p>He just never thought he would see it in Florida. \"It is something phenomenal,\" the chief elections officer for South Africa's northern cape said yesterday, on a sweltering morning in downtown Miami, as the last of the early voters queued for up to three hours. </p> <p>\"To see this passion is really something that could inspire the rest of the world.\" </p> <p>To put it bluntly, an inspirational election in Florida would be a best-case scenario. </p> <p>Mr Bekebeke belongs to one of two delegations of international observers who were taking up their positions across America's swing states yesterday to monitor the vote for evidence of long-rumoured dirty tricks: harassment of voters at the polls, illegitimate challenges to people's voter registrations, and ballot fraud. </p> <p>\"Normally we say that the kids learn from the adults, but sometimes it's those wise adults who can learn from the kids,\" said Mr Bekebeke, fresh from monitoring the Rwandan election last year. </p> <p>\"That's the spirit in which I'm here in America.\" </p> <p>Just over 100 foreign observers, mainly from Europe, are focusing their efforts on Florida, Ohio, and a small number of other states in the face of increasingly fractious disputes, primarily over Republican plans to challenge the eligibility of newly registered voters. </p> <p>The Bush campaign appeared to have suffered a defeat on that score yesterday when two Ohio judges ruled that activists would not be allowed to challenge voters inside polling stations. </p> <p>One of the two cases was brought by a black couple in Cincinnati who argued that the Republican plan was designed to suppress the African-American vote - a viewpoint echoed by Jesse Jackson, who called it \"Old South politics\". </p> <p>Republicans called the decision \"erroneous\", and said they planned to appeal. </p> <p>The international monitors will not intervene should they witness harassment. </p> <p>\"We do not interfere. That's a very important principle,\" said Urdur Gunnarsdottir, a spokeswoman for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is sponsoring most of the observers. \"What we will do is to issue a preliminary report on Thursday.\" </p> <p>There have been certain tensions between the monitors and their host nation: authorities in Miami-Dade county, scene of much of the recount drama in 2000, have refused to allow monitors to go within 50 feet of polling stations. </p> <p>Then there is the culture clash: the Greek OSCE delegation dispatched to Fort Lauderdale reportedly refused to stay in non-smoking hotel rooms there. </p> <p>But xenophobic hostility from voters themselves has been entirely absent, insisted Owen Thomas, a British monitor and chief executive of the election-management firm Electoral Reform Services, brought to the US, like Mr Bekebeke, by the human rights group Global Exchange. </p> <p>\"It's quite the opposite - they see us at the early voting sites and actively want to talk to us,\" said Mr Thomas, who had been struck by the patience and persistence of Floridian voters. </p> <p>\"They have to queue for hours,\" he said. \"In the UK there'd be a riot.\" </p> <p>So far, the Global Exchange monitors said, they had witnessed no improprieties. But the true test comes today. </p> <p>The fact that early voting sites have not been the scene of tense registration challenges between voters and party workers does not necessarily mean the election will be clean. It may be because there are so few sites open prior to the day itself: their catchment areas are too big for activists to co-ordinate the information they need to challenge people successfully. </p> <p>The US justice department is also dispatching more than 1,000 of its own observers around the country, including to Long Island, New York, as a result of a surge in Hispanic registrations there.</p>",
  "Election monitors in Florida today reported long queues and some minor glitches but no major problems with voting, suggesting that the state was on track to avoid a repeat of the legal tussles that marred the 2000 election. <p>\"There have not been any problems except that the lines are long,\" said Manuel Antonio Garreton Merino, director of Chile's Institute of Public Affairs and one of six foreign observers brought to Florida by human rights group Global Exchange.</p> <p>\"Above all you see great motivation and a big turnout. It's like people are saying we won't let (2000) happen again.\"</p> <p>More than 10 million Floridians are eligible to vote and all the signs pointed to a high turnout, election officials said, reflecting the mood in the rest of the country.</p> <p>Determined to avoid a rerun of the saga of lawsuits that took place after the last election, the state led by the president's younger brother, Governor Jeb Bush, replaced its punch-card ballot system with computer voting technology.</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats fielded thousands of lawyers in the state but, in the early stages at least, the only suggestion that their services might be needed came from isolated reports of last-minute dirty tricks campaigns.</p> <p>Palm Beach County election official, Theresa LePore, said some voters had complained about receiving bogus calls directing them to the wrong polling stations, or telling them they were not registered and could not vote. \"It's causing a lot of confusion with the voters,\" she said.</p> <p>In Daytona Beach, more than 13,000 early votes were lost when poll workers cut the power to a vote-counting machine, said Deannie Lowe, the Volusia County Supervisor of Elections. The ballots will have to be re-fed into a machine. \"It will take some time, but we have the ballots. Every vote will be counted,\" said Lowe.</p> <p>Activists for anti-Bush group MoveOn complained that an unknown caller contacted BellSouth, the local phone company, to cancel most of the group's phone lines in Miami and Fort Lauderdale. \"We have our lawyers looking into this because it's totally unacceptable,\" said spokesman Jose Quinonez.</p> <p>In Ohio, meanwhile, a woman filed a lawsuit on behalf of voters who did not receive absentee ballots on time. A Toledo federal judge granted her request that they be allowed to cast provisional ballots.</p> <p>Republican Party officials accused Democrats of violating election rules at scattered sites around Colorado, and a lawyer for Senator Kerry's campaign in Pennsylvania said some people were prevented from voting when at least 12 Allegheny County precincts ran out of provisional ballots. </p> <p>But such incidents were relatively few in number, and the overall picture was of a smooth polling operation. Doug Chapin, director of the Election Reform Information Project, a non-partisan research group, said: \"So far, it's no big [problem], but lots of littles. We know of no major meltdowns anywhere along the lines.\"</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United are putting together a revised financial package aimed at dissuading Wes Brown from leaving the club. </p> <p>Brown is a free agent at the end of the season and has already rejected one contract offer, but United have been encouraged by declarations from the 25-year-old defender that he wants to stay at Old Trafford. Both sides are aiming to reach a compromise when Brown's advisers meet the club's chief executive David Gill tomorrow. </p> <p>Newcastle are among a clutch of clubs hoping to benefit from the current impasse, and a bid from St James' Park is almost certain if Brown's future is still undecided when the transfer window opens in January. </p> <p>Ideally, Brown would like to remain in his home city but expects a deal that puts him in the middle bracket of earners at Old Trafford. He is currently among the club's lowest-paid players and the directors have been reluctant to meet his financial requirements because of his susceptibility to injury.</p>",
  "Criticisms of Americans for being insular, while often valid, usually fail to grasp the sheer scale of the place. Texas, the country's second largest state, is the size of Germany, Italy and Denmark combined; its population would fill Switzerland, Portugal and Ireland. Those who accuse Americans of being parochial must first concede that America is a huge parish. <p>New England, where I started my journey, and west Texas, where I ended it five weeks later, could be in two entirely different nations. Not only had the topography, climate and architecture radically altered, but so had the people and their attitudes towards everything from religion and government to taxes and guns. </p> <p>In that time the political landscape had changed too. I left the Democratic challenger's home town of Boston with John Kerry fighting to defend his purple hearts and stay in the race as he languished eight points behind Bush in the polls. I left Mr Bush's home town of Midland with the contest tied and Mr Bush explaining a looted weapons cache in Iraq. </p> <p>One of the few things that has remained constant while on the road has been the ubiquity of the stars and stripes. The national flag billows everywhere. It flies from porches, hangs from store fronts and decorates the bumpers of many cars ahead of me. The interstate highway, network television and chain stores aside, the ever-present national flag has been the one constant indicator that I have remained in the same country all along. </p> <p>But these demonstrations of patriotism offer little or no suggestion of which side of the political divide people are on. You are as likely to find them among Republicans as Democrats. In normal times this strong sense of national identity is the thread that keeps this diverse patchwork of states, cultures and ethnicities together. </p> <p><b>Frayed</b><br> </p> <p>But these are no normal times. Indeed, over the last month it has occasionally felt as though these threads may be becoming perilously frayed. For at its heart this election has highlighted the thorny, divisive issue of what that flag stands for. For many, at stake is not just who will run the country, but who owns it and what core values should underpin it. </p> <p>On the left are those who believe the nation is being transformed by a corporate theocracy. Trekking through the suburbs of Derry, New Hampshire, Pam and Patrick Devaney overcame their shyness to go knocking on doors in search of progressive voters. \"I'm not comfortable doing this but it has to be done,\" said Pam. \"Our democracy is at stake. This is the most important election in my lifetime.\" </p> <p>\"I always thought someone else was out there doing the job for us,\" said Patrick. \"Now I wonder what we're doing in New Jersey.\" </p> <p>On the right are those who fear the encroachment of secular liberalism. \"I fear for this country if Kerry wins,\" said Burton Kephart, from Franklin, Pennsylvania, whose son Jonathan was killed in Iraq. \"God has a plan for the ages. Bush will hold back the evil a little bit. He is a God-fearing man. He believes in praying to a God who hears his prayers. He's a leader.\" </p> <p>Many Americans, of course, lie in between these two extremes. Like the hotel worker in Dearborn, Michigan, weighing her opposition to abortion with her opposition to the war who was rooting for Mr Kerry with reservations, they do not fit easily into either camp. </p> <p>But when the nation goes to the polls today they will only have two camps to choose from and what little common ground there may have been between them has effectively been torched. </p> <p>Watching the third presidential debate with about 40 students in Iowa City, the Republicans sat on one side and the Democrats on the other. At moments the Republicans would break into cheers or laughter at a phrase or facial expression of one of the two candidates, to the bewilderment of the Democrats. A few minutes later the Democrats would do the same, leaving the Republicans similarly confused. </p> <p>They were not just watching the candidates on a split screen. They were viewing the entire event as though from a split screen, each side hermetically sealed from the other as though they were witnessing two completely different events in a parallel universe. </p> <p>On these rare occasions when people are presented with the same raw data, the two camps have managed to fashion conclusions that are not just different but almost entirely contradictory. So rather than partisan arguments adjusting to take account of reality, reality is altered to suit the argument. </p> <p>So it has been throughout the trip, with both sides rejecting negative polling results as rigged and denouncing the media for being biased in favour of the other side, leaving few basic facts that anyone can agree on. </p> <p>A recent poll, released by the Programme on International Policy Attitudes, showed that the overwhelming majority of Bush supporters still believe that Iraq had ties to al-Qaida or the September 11 terrorist attacks and had weapons of mass destruction or a programme to develop them. They also believe that the world favours a Bush victory. In each case only a minority of Democrats shared those views. </p> <p>It follows that from this different understanding of the problems come entirely polarised conclusions about the solutions. </p> <p>Rick Sapareto in New Hampshire supports Mr Bush and the war in Iraq. \"I'm very concerned that my boys may end up fighting a war in 15 years because we failed to take action,\" he said. </p> <p>Lisa O'Neill, who lives just a few minutes away, supports Mr Kerry and opposes the war for almost entirely the same reason. \"I have an 11- and 13-year-old who could be drafted if this carries on,\" she said. When I called them both the day after the first debate each one thought their side had won. </p> <p>The Democrats that I have met seem much more aware than Republicans that the world will be watching nervously today. Indeed Republicans seem quite bullish in their indifference. But while the rest of the world has been watching the US these past few months, the US has not been particularly interested in the rest of the world. </p> <p>In his classic book, Democracy in America, the 19th century French intellectual Alexis de Tocqueville wrote: \"All the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a stranger to be incomprehensible or puerile, and he is at a loss whether to pity a people who take such arrant trifles in good earnest or to envy that happiness which enables a community to discuss them.\" </p> <p>This is an election about America and its obsessions, old and new, and many of them are indeed incomprehensible. Guns, gays, God, abortion, stem cells, jobs, health care, social security and the shortage of the flu vaccine have all been raised at one time or another. </p> <p>\"You'd think with everything else going on in the world they'd have something better to worry about than gays getting married,\" said Ann Fuhrman, a lesbian living in Springfield, Missouri. </p> <p>But the United Nations, global warming have not come up once; the Middle East is a big issue for Arab-Americans and Jews everywhere, but nobody else has mentioned it. </p> <p><b>Invasion</b><br> </p> <p>So, when they discuss Iraq and the war on terror they do so in terms of the human and financial costs to America. If the occupation were going well you do not get the impression that the invasion of a sovereign country and the lack of weapons of mass destruction would be a major issue. </p> <p>\"I know we're making an attempt to help the Iraqi people,\" said Yvonne Shostack, in Derry. \"But I thought things would be more resolved than they are. People are still getting killed and we're still out there.\" </p> <p>But what is most bizarre about this polarisation is that all the emotional energy appears to be concentrated around one pole. </p> <p>Over the past five weeks I have not met one person who had a passionate word to say about Mr Kerry one way or the other. Though I don't doubt that some exist, the Democrats I have encountered are primarily motivated by their hatred of Mr Bush. \"If they put up a vacuum cleaner against Bush we'd vote for it and just ask them to change the bag every now and then,\" quipped Gene Lyons, a columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. </p> <p>Republicans are adversely galvanised by their love of Bush. \"He stepped up to the plate and showed the world what we can do,\" said Chris Paxos, at a job centre in Canton, Ohio. </p> <p>This is not an election about platforms or ideas. It has brought the issue of who owns America and what its values should be into stark relief. But it cannot answer them. </p> <p>Today will be a referendum on one man - George Bush - and his record. Whoever wins will do so by a narrow margin and inherit a deeply divided nation. But, legal challenges notwithstanding, that will be tomorrow's story. And nobody is looking that far ahead.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair survived his second Labour backbench rebellion in as many days as MPs failed in a bid to ban smacking in the Commons tonight. </p> <p>After a brief but highly charged debate, an amendment to the children bill outlawing the \"hitting\" of youngsters was rejected by 424 to 75, a majority of 349. </p> <p>A move to delete the tighter definition of \"reasonable punishment\" from the bill was also defeated by 284 votes to 208, a government majority of 76. </p> <p>The bill will instead allow mild smacking, while barring any physical punishment which causes visible bruising.</p> <p>Late last night, 29 Labour MPs defied the whips to vote against the second reading of the gambling bill, which will allow super-casinos to open in Britain. </p> <p>Tonight's revolt came after Mr Blair failed to win over opponents of smacking at an 11th hour meeting last night. The health select committee chairman, David Hinchliffe, led the bid to scrap the 19th-century legal defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" by citing experience gained during his time as a social worker. </p> <p>Mr Hinchliffe said it was \"a scandal and a disgrace that in 21st century Britain, at least one child every week ... dies at the hands of their parents or carers\". </p> <p>\"Like colleagues who have also worked in child protection,\" he said, \"I don't just think there is a connection between our shocking levels of child deaths and our laws permitting so called reasonable chastisement - I know there is.\"</p> <p>The Children Are Unbeatable! Alliance, made up of more than 350 organisations involved with children and families, had urged MPs to back Mr Hinchliffe's amendment and condemned the bill as \"unsafe and unworkable\". </p> <p>Despite pleas for a free vote, Labour MPs were subject to a three-line whip, leaving them open to disciplinary measures if they failed to support the children's minister, Margaret Hodge.</p> <p>Challenged last week at prime minister's question time, Mr Blair said he hoped there was a \"common-sense way\" through the issue and insisted most parents could tell the difference between discipline and abuse of a child. </p> <p>Introducing his amendment to the bill, Mr Hinchliffe called for children to be given the same protection from being hit as adults, and condemned the government for whipping Labour MPs to vote against his move. </p> <p>\"For some people this is an abstract academic issue. For myself and a large number of other MPs it is about the basic human rights of a significant proportion of our population,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Our strength of feeling comes from a certain knowledge that our laws and society could do a great deal more to ensure the wellbeing of vulnerable and abused youngsters.\" </p> <p>Children were generally better treated now than at any time in history, according to Mr Hinchliffe, but for a minority the reality was very different. </p> <p>\"Compared with many other similar countries, our record on child deaths is frankly appalling,\" he said. </p> <p>As debate on the bill got underway today, both the Tories and Liberal Democrats complained that the government was allocating insufficient time - just over six hours - to debate a series of amendments to the legislation, including those on smacking. </p> <p>Mr Blair's official spokesman said: \"We do not in any way condone abuse of children, but equally we believe that reasonable chastisement is what parents are allowed to do.\"</p> <p>Commenting on the vote, Tony Samphier of the Children Are Unbeatable! Alliance said: \"Tony Blair has sadly chosen Victorian values over modern family standards by defending corporal punishment of children. History will frown on him as the prime minister who failed to give babies and children the same protection from being hit that he himself enjoys.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills, however, welcomed the vote. \"The government is pleased to be sending a clear message to parents that they are free to bring up their children in a supportive disciplinary environment,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>In search of the perfect day? Try this: work early in the day, and tackle your trickiest conundrums around noon. Do yoga or pilates at around 5pm, followed by a workout or swim. Have a glass of wine or two with an early dinner at around 7pm, and give The Ten O'Clock News a miss: instead have a long, relaxing massage, ideally followed by lovemaking. </p> <p>Why? Well, according to experts, our body's systems are governed by circadian rhythms that repeat in 24-hour cycles - which means we can time our behaviour to ensure our body is best primed to deal with what we're asking of it. So morning is best for work because our short-term memory, logical reasoning and concentration peak then: yoga is good in the afternoon, because that's when our bodies are at their most flexible. In the late afternoon, body temperature peaks - some experts say this is a \"natural warm-up\" for exercise. Your digestive system and your liver are at their best around 7pm, and skin sensitivity and libido are highest at around 9.30pm. </p> <p>Researchers are finding out more all the time about the ebb and flow of the human body: last week a new study from Long Island Jewish Medical Centre found that lung function peaks in the late afternoon: another reason why it's good to exercise then. Nearly 5,000 patients were analysed, and the findings presented to the American College of Chest Physicians were that lung function is at its least effective around midday, and at its best between 4pm and 5pm. </p> <p>This has implications for more than just when you go to the gym: what lung specialists are excited by is the possibility of timing medication so that it is given at a time when it can penetrate the respiratory tissues as effectively as possible. Asthma medications, for example, could be more effective in the late afternoon: and many patients who deliver bronchodilators round the clock could find they get the same effects with a lower dose if their drugs are time-targeted. </p> <p>It might also, says Long Island researcher Dr Boris Medarov, be better to extubate patients who have been on ventilators in the late afternoon, when their lung function will be at its best and they may be better able to breathe on their own. </p> <p>It's the fine-tuning of drugs to the body's natural rhythms that is behind much of the current research in the field. \"There are big possibilities,\" says science writer Leon Kreitzman, co-author (with Professor Russell Foster of Imperial College, London) of Rhythms of Life, a book about our daily rhythms. \"We're learning more all the time about when is the best time to administer drugs. In the field of cancer, for example, where the drugs are very powerful, it's especially significant. What you want to do with cancer drugs is hit the tumour cells when they are dividing - the problem is, you're also hitting other areas of the body with dividing cells, such as the hair and the gut. That's why people having chemotherapy so often lose their hair and feel sick. If we could find a way of timing chemotherapy more effectively, we might be able to give the drugs at a time when the tumour cells are dividing, but when the hair cells and the gut cells are not, and so reduce the impact on those areas.\" </p> <p>Not all the reasons why certain systems work best at certain times are fully understood, but in general, says Foster, what the research tends to show is that the human body's rhythms are linked to two external factors: light and temperature. \"We live in a world that rotates once in 24 hours, and over that period there are huge changes in light and temperature,\" he says. \"If you look at even the most primitive forms of life on the planet, you see they have a molecular clock - every aspect of life is finely tuned to cope with varying demands of our constantly changing world. </p> <p>\"What the body has evolved is a system of not just reacting to the changes in light and temperature, but getting ready for that change.\" Which is why you find that body temperature cools in readiness for sleep a couple of hours before you go to sleep (electric blankets and hot water bottles, some researchers argue, could actually inhibit the body's natural slumber-prompt), and the heart and blood systems crank up for dawn in the early hours. But even with that slow start, with the body adjusting slowly to the demands of the day, the first few hours of being up and about, with our systems still adapting to the differences between night and day, are still the most dangerous: most heart attacks, for example, happen in the first couple of hours after getting up. </p> <p>The clock that controls all body systems is, says Foster, embedded within our genes - 12 or 14 genes have been identified that help regulate it with the production of certain proteins. As a result, he and Kreitzman argue, you can't simply override it: you can't expect the night-shift worker to be as productive as the day-shift worker, because that's not when we are primed to be at our best. </p> <p>And although we can adapt to changes in time zones and overcome jet-lag by slowly readjusting the clock, it will still be set so that the body processes chime in with light and temperature in the part of the world we're now in. </p> <p>In fact, says Professor Greg Atkinson, a sports scientist at Liverpool John Moores University, the body's natural tendency is to run on a slightly slower than 24-hour system: without any external stimuli, he says, we would tend to do things half an hour later each day. </p> <p>\"There have been studies done where people have been isolated from external signals such as changes in light or temperature, and what they have found is that our rhythms do persist, but they are not as strong as they are in the ordinary everyday environment,\" he says. \"The natural body clock would probably function on a 24.5-hour cycle, rather than a 24-hour one.\" What that gives us, says Atkinson, is the flexibility to respond to changes such as crossed time zones, and even the minor adjustment of the clock for British Summer Time last weekend. </p> <p>Atkinson's work has looked specifically at the impact of the body clock on sports performance. What he's found is that even apparently minor changes can have a big impact, such as fluctuations in body temperature. \"The variation is only around 0.8 to 1 degree centigrade,\" he says. \"It may not sound a lot, but it has a big effect - it acts like a natural pre-competitive warm-up, so your body's metabolism is faster and the rate of connection of your nerve signals is faster.\" </p> <p>It should not surprise us, then, he says, that studies have found that people left to make up their own minds on when they undertake certain tasks tend to exercise in the early evening. Not surprising, either, that many Olympic records are made and broken in events that take place in the early evening: for athletes looking for glory, it seems, checking the schedule could be almost as important as the last-minute training. </p> <p> <strong>All in the timing: Your guide to when your body works best</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1-2am:</strong> Urine production is at its lowest </p> <p><strong> 3-4am:</strong> Body at its lowest ebb - most likely to die </p> <p><strong> 5-6am:</strong> Growth hormones peak </p> <p><strong> 7-8am:</strong> Migraines most common; strokes most likely; sperm count highest - most likely to conceive </p> <p><strong> 9-10am:</strong> Peak time for heart attacks; short-term memory and logical reasoning at their best </p> <p><strong> 11am-12 noon:</strong> Concentration at its best </p> <p><strong> 1-2pm:</strong> Peak urine production </p> <p><strong> 3-4pm:</strong> Lung function at its best </p> <p><strong> 5-6pm:</strong> Body at its fittest - best time to exercise; alertness peaks; body at its most flexible, muscle tone peaks </p> <p><strong> 7-8pm:</strong> Liver function best; toothache peaks; digestive system at its best </p> <p><strong> 9-10pm:</strong> Menopausal flushes most common; skin sensivity peaks; libido at its highest </p> <p><strong> 11pm-12 midnight:</strong> Body at its most allergic; ovulation most likely</p>",

  "<p>News agency Reuters today demanded a full investigation into the shooting of one of its cameramen in Iraq, after rejecting the US military's explanation of the incident.</p> <p>The Reuters global managing editor, David Schlesinger, dismissed American claims that Dhia Najim was killed yesterday during a gunfight between marines and insurgents in the city of Ramadi.</p> <p>Mr Schlesinger said video footage taken just before Mr Najim died showed that the fighting in Ramadi, which the cameraman had been filming earlier in the day, had subsided.</p> <p>\"We reject the clear implication in the marines' statement that Dhia was part of an insurgent group,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This claim is not supported by the available evidence.

  "<p>Budget airline Ryanair announced record half-year profits today, but warned that high oil prices meant it remained cautious about the rest of the year.</p> <p>The Dublin-based carrier saw interim pre-tax profits increase by a surprise 17.6% - from \u20ac187m (\u00a3130m) to \u20ac220m - during the six months to the end of September, while passenger numbers rose by 24% to 14m.</p> <p>The airline said its low fares strategy had remained robust in a \"difficult economic environment characterised by record fuel prices and intense price competition\". However, it warned that future profits guidance would be affected by the cost of its fuel. </p> <p>It said that if the price of a barrel of Brent crude remained at $50 for the rest of the year, it would incur extra costs of around \u20ac55m. Chief executive Michael O'Leary warned that the high oil price and \"irrational competition\" could speed up his prediction of a \"bloodbath\" in the industry and airline casualties this winter.</p> <p>But although he said the group remained cautious in its outlook for the second half of the year, Mr O'Leary added that he expected to achieve significant increases in passenger volume growth. </p> <p>\"With the lowest cost base, we believe Ryanair will continue to grow profitably,\" he said. Today's results represent its 30th consecutive quarter of unbroken profitability. </p> <p>A 5% decline in yield - or income per passenger - was at the better end of the airline's guidance of a 5% to 10% fall. Ryanair said this was down to \"a combination of slightly better peak summer yields and the initial impact of the fuel price surcharges imposed by many of our high fare competitors.\" </p> <p>The group also said it had benefited from non-core services such as car hire, hotel sales and excess baggage charges. </p> <p>\"When all is said and done, there is a lot more positive tone in there than perhaps we would have expected,\" said analyst Shane Matthews of NCB Stockbrokers, who maintains a \"buy\" recommendation on the stock. </p> <p>The above-expectation results sent Ryanair shares up 44c - or 11% - to \u20ac4.45 by midday.</p> <p>The airline said it was continuing its \"disciplined route growth\", with two new bases at Barcelona and Rome exceeding expectations, as did the group's 41 other routes, which were launched this summer. </p> <p>Its expansion will continue this winter, with Rome and Milan each getting two more jets, Frankfurt, Stockholm and Glasgow each getting one extra aircraft, and the fleet at Luton rising from one jet to four.</p> <p>The winter will also see the airline opening five destinations including Latvian capital Riga, Santander and Seville in Spain and Porto in Portugal.</p>",
  "<p>British retail sales rose more than expected in October and at their sharpest rate in three months, according to a CBI survey published today. </p> <p>The employers' organisation said 37% of firms in its monthly distributive trades survey saw sales rise during the month, while 26% reported a fall.</p> <p>The balance of +11 far exceeded retailers' own expectations of a -4 balance. In September, the figure hit a year-and-a-half low of -9.</p> <p>The figures indicate that consumer demand still appears to be holding up and increase the probability that interest rates could still rise further in the months ahead.</p> <p>But the CBI cautioned that growth was still below normal for the time of year and that the underlying trend was still downwards. It argued that the Bank of England should hold off from raising interest rates.</p> <p>\"An interest rate increase in November would be damaging and there is no need for the Bank to consider a further rise for the foreseeable future,\" said John Longworth, chairman of the CBI's survey panel.</p> <p>Just one of 45 analysts polled by Reuters last week predicted that the Bank would lift interest rates above the current 4.75% when the monetary policy committee next meets on Thursday. A succession of weak data has convinced most that five hikes since last November have succeeded in slowing the economy down.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of the consultancy, Global Insight, said: \"While the CBI distributive trade survey for October was stronger than expected, the underlying trend in spending has clearly softened in recent months as higher interest rates bite.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, spending is still being supported by high employment, a modest pick-up in earnings growth and attractive prices on the high street.\"</p> <p>A separate report by the British Retail Consortium today showed that shop prices in October were 1.37% lower than a year earlier, representing the steepest decline in the survey's history. The figures suggest that the rise in retail sales is coming at the expense of shops' profit margins. </p> <p>The CBI survey showed retailers expect sales growth to pick up slightly further in November, with the expectations balance standing at +12. </p> <p>The survey was conducted between September 29 and October 20 with 200 responses.</p>",
  "<p>Pro Kerry</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"This is the most critical election of my lifetime. ...We remain a land of great promise but we need to move America towards the fulfillment of the promises that she has made; economic justice, civil rights, protection of the environment, a living wage, respect for others, and humility in exercising our power at home and around the world.

We can't tell you who to vote for, but we're going to vote for John Kerry. He is a man of experience, conviction and intelligence; possessing in abundance the qualities America needs in its President.

And we're at war, which is an expensive, draining venture regardless of which side you come down on. There are no easy answers; none of this stuff is black or white. The only thing that's clear to us is that our President has grossly mismanaged our country for the last four years, and it's time for that to change.

  "<p>Companies are investing more and more every year in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, but the vast majority are still failing to get their message across, a new survey has found this week. </p> <p>\"Most companies fail to give any real insight into what they are reporting on and why they are doing so,\" reads the damning conclusion of the Global Reporters 2004 Survey, the third in a series of best practice studies by consultancy firm SustainAbility. </p> <p>The findings of the study will probably not surprise the handful of people - mostly employees, plus a few ethical investors and special interest groups - who have actually read an example of this latest trend in corporate reporting. </p> <p>\"The vast majority of CSR reports out there are ineffective as pieces of communication - they are trying to be all things to all people and failing to meets the needs of anyone,\" admits Kate Crawford of Flag, a specialist CSR communications firm.</p> <p>While Judy Kuszewski, co-author of the survey, notes a reduction in the length of the average CSR report (though still a hefty read at 72 pages), she agrees that companies need to adopt a much more tailored approach to their ethical communications. </p> <p>\"We have to get a lot closer to the point at which they [readers] are going to be using this information. It could be at point of sale, or investor briefings, or mainstream marketing or advertising,\" Ms Kuszewski said. </p> <p>The increase in online reporting demonstrates how leading corporate reporters are beginning to follow her advice. Online reports allow for considerable more specialised information and appeal particularly to 'data-miners' from the investment community. Six of the top 50 reporters identified in the survey now solely publish web-based reports, of which BAA and Rio Tinto are rated among the best. </p> <p>Yet, even if corporate reporters succeed in getting their CSR messages heard, they still face a massive credibility gap with most stakeholders.</p> <p>\"There is a notable tendency for such reports to read like public relations polemic rather than risk assessment reports,\" says George Dallas, managing director of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based rating agency and co-sponsor of the survey. </p> <p>Little will shake such scepticism until companies show a willingness to balance their characteristic 'good news' messaging with frank admissions of poor performance and honesty about how complex the CSR agenda is to manage. </p> <p>Jeroem van der Veer, Shell's new chief executive, has no qualms about the current failings of most CSR reporting: \"I still see too little willingness to talk about failures and too little input from credible, and sometimes critical, third parties\". </p> <p>It's a moot point, and one that van der Veer is well placed to make after his company's oil reserves crisis earlier this year. Still, the consistent inclusion of negative third-party comment in Shell's ethical reporting over the last seven years may explain why the embattled oil major still ranks a surprisingly high eighth place in the Global Reporters survey. A notable exception of corporate transparency comes in Gap's 2003 report, in which the US retailer openly admits to two incidents of child labour and frequent health and safety violations - although not so openly, sceptics will note, as to land the clothing firm in court. </p> <p>But can the public even trust what companies write in these reports? More than before, the survey concludes, noting the increase in companies submitting their non-financial reports for independent assessment. Over three-quarters of the survey's Top 50 ethical reports include a discussion of external verification. </p> <p>\"Without robust assurance, sustainability reporting will be neither credible nor useful, either for the reporting companies or for their stakeholders,\" argues Dr Simon Zadek, chief executive of assurance experts AccountAbility. </p> <p>Better assurance, according to Zadek, can also help resolve what is perhaps the biggest sticking point for most ethical reports: namely, do they disclose the material ethical issues that users actually need to know about? </p> <p>Most reports do not, the survey concludes. The majority of companies either remain silent on critical risks facing their industry or pursue a 'carpet-bombing' approach that fails to distinguish relevant information from the irrelevant. Typical is DaimlerChrysler's report, in which the survey's authors accuse of devoting \"more space to photographs of handshakes than discussions on climate change\". </p> <p>The problem owes more to management oversight than intentional evasion, Ms Kuszewski believes. Few reports give any indication of the process by which environmental and social issues are prioritised and managed, she argues. \"It makes it hard for a reader who doesn't have a very deep knowledge of the company and its sector to be able to say with any confidence that the issues presented in this report are the right ones\".</p> <p>Not all ethical reports avoid the cliched elephant in the bedroom. Examples highlighted in the survey include BP's description of the impact of its products on climate change, Unilever's treatment of nutrition and obesity, and SABMiller's coverage of responsible drinking. </p> <p>The French multinational Lafarge is also singled out in the report for its discussion on public policy activities in relation to climate change. \"The global cement company's stance may not be to everyone's liking, but at least it is clear what it is\". At last, something that sounds worth reading. </p> <p><strong>Top CSR reporters</strong></p> <p>Co-operative Financial Services Novo Nordisk BP British American Tobacco BT Group BAA Rabobank Rio Tinto Royal Dutch/Shell Group HP Unilever</p> <p>Oliver Balch is managing editor of the CSR journal, Corporate Citizenship Briefing</p>",
  "\"My earliest memory is of a lawnmower,\" wrote Derek Jarman on a page ripped out of an A4 exercise book. It was 1991, his health and eyesight were failing, his elegant, swooping italic hand was unravelling a little, but he was still scribbling down his thoughts on gardens and gardening, subjects close to his heart and inextricably bound up with his output as filmmaker and writer. <p>Some of his late manuscripts and notebooks - covers beautifully personalised with gold or black impasto, full of poems, jottings and memories - will be revealed this week at an exhibition at the British Library in London.</p> <p>Jarman kept 16 volumes of diaries recounting the making of his garden at Prospect Cottage, on the Kent coastline, where he moved in 1988. Here he created a curious Eden in the most hostile, salt-caked, windswept environment imaginable, a strange garden full of twisted metal and driftwood, in the shadow of the Dungeness nuclear power station.</p> <p>Much of the material from the notebooks was incorporated into his published diaries, Modern Nature, but the exquisite objects themselves, two of which the British Library has borrowed from Jarman's estate, have never before been seen in public.</p> <p>Jarman's first notebook, dated January-February 1989, begins with the inscription: \"Yesternight I set out from the bright city, to the fifth quarter of the globe. Here winter is the coldest. The salt sea marsh is mapped in darkness.\"</p> <p>Beside it is a plan of his plot, in its very early days, charting clumps of sea kale, rosemary and curry plant. He pressed a tiny daffodil between the leaves.</p> <p>The exhibition will also show a large album, full of poems and notes towards his film The Garden. It was the nearest he came to a shooting script for the work, which posited Dungeness as an allegorical landscape in which Christ's life is retold.</p> <p>\"To whom it may concern, from the fifth quarter of the Globe,\" it is inscribed. Inside are drafts of poems, photographs, and the odd bit of practical detail on the film - a list of possible locations for the first couple of days' shooting.</p> <p>According to Jamie Andrews, a curator of the exhibition The Writer in the Garden, the notion of time in gardening - its cyclical nature - was fundamental to Jarman's aesthetics. \"The fact that cinema, by contrast, is always to a certain extent linear frustrated him. He always said that the garden was the absolute centre for him.\"</p> <p>The very late loose-leaf notes, according to Mr Andrews, retain Jarman's wit and warmth, despite failing health.

  "<p>Students were today urged to get vaccinated against mumps amid warnings of an epidemic on Britain's campuses. </p> <p>Some 3,000 young people are predicted to come down with mumps by the end of the year compared with just 10 in 1996.</p> <p>Students are particularly vulnerable. Many 18 to 22-year-olds were not properly immunised as children because they were too young for the triple vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and did not properly take the double dose of the individual vaccines. </p> <p>During the early 1990s as a result of the introduction of the MMR vaccine, cases of mumps dropped rapidly. But this also means that today's 18 to 22-year-olds have not had the chance to build up a natural immunity. </p> <p>Coupled with the close environment of campus, some universities are warning that a major epidemic could be imminent and some are even advising that students who do come down with the illness go into quarantine in their parents' homes. </p> <p>According to research by the Daily Telegraph, Nottingham University has had 60 cases of mumps this term, Birmingham University had seven new cases last weekend alone and Leeds University has organised mass vaccinations for all pupils. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Leeds said: \"In response to a rise in the number of mumps cases nationally and advice from the Leeds public health agency the university medical practice organised vaccination sessions for all students at the start of term.</p> <p>\"There will be another vaccination session in February. Plans are in place should there be a major outbreak of the illness.\"</p> <p>The symptoms of mumps include fever, loss of appetite and a painful and swollen throat. </p> <p>In May the Health Protection Agency reported that a UK student was infected with mumps during the 2004 Student Games in Lloret de Mar in Spain during April. The authority issued warnings to the 2,000 students of 41 universities attending the games and outbreaks of mumps were subsequently reported among students in Derby and York.</p> <p>As early as Spring last year Sheffield began a mass innoculation programme to prevent an outbreak.</p>",
  "<p>The tale of Hollywood and the Bush administration is a tale of two Americas. Each side views the other with a deep suspicion. Each uses the other define their own position. Call it the \"culture wars\", a battle for the soul of America; or file it as a pantomime stand-off between two wealthy, privileged and influential camps who probably have more in common than they care to admit. </p> <p>But if the Bushites have spent the past four years deriding Hollywood as a corrosive influence, Hollywood has responded in kind. The past four years have seen a surfeit of movies that use the Bush presidency as their touchstone - be it explicitly or otherwise. Needless to say, it doesn't make for a pretty picture. </p> <p>At the vanguard are the Bush-bashing documentaries. <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/fahrenheit911\">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> charted the relationship between the Bushes and the Saudi royal family and implied that George W and Bin Laden were two sides of the same coin - both playboy heirs to oil fortunes who found God and kick-started a holy war. Robert Greenwald's <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1335770,00.html\">Uncovered: The War on Iraq</a> ditched Michael Moore's rambunctious humour in favour of an angry assault on recent foreign policy, while <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1316970,00.html\"> Outfoxed</a> spotlighted the way in which the Murdoch-owned Fox News played the role of cheerleader throughout the conflict.</p> <p>Behind this vanguard, though, are a host of other, more veiled comments on the Bush administration. At times these veils are brazenly skimpy, little more than fig-leaves. Take the remake of <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/features/featurepages/0,4120,1339193,00.html\">The Manchurian Candidate</a>, in which the behind-the-scenes villain is a faceless corporation (part Halliburton, part Carlyle Group) being investigated for its \"no bid\" contracts for foreign reconstruction work and which schemes to install a brainwashed frontman in the White House. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1203773,00.html\">The Day After Tomorrow</a> stands as mainstream Hollywood's most upfront assault on the Republicans. As global warming triggers a disaster-movie catastrophe, the all-powerful vice-president is shown blithely dismissing the warnings of a coming apocalypse. Just so we get the message, the actor playing the Veep turns out to be the spitting image of Dick Cheney. </p> <p>Other films took a more subtle tack. <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,839293,00.html\">The Quiet American</a> adopted the MASH technique, spotlighting an old misadventure in foreign climes - in this case US involvement in south-east Asia - as a way of addressing contemporary issues. It was a similar situation with Errol Morris's Oscar-winning documentary <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1069289,00.html\">The Fog of War</a>. Although ostensibly concerned with Vietnam, the film was read in most quarters as a sly thesis on Iraq; something its subject - former defence secretary Robert McNamara - angrily denied. </p> <p>Nestled behind the battle-lines, meanwhile, lay a bunch of films so heavily veiled that even their makers might not have been entirely sure what message they were giving. Lars von Trier may be no fan of America, for example, but was his <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1045840,00.html\">Dogville</a> really an assault on Bush family values, or just a wider attack on small-town hypocrisy? Was the Hollywood epic <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1006055,00.html\">Troy</a> a warning on the dangers of an over-extended empire, or just a mega-budget excuse to show a buffed-up Brad Pitt? Did the Chinese-language, Miramax-funded <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,767582,00.html\">Hero</a> preach a nationalistic mantra that - as the Observer's Philip French argued - chimes with George Bush's own vision? Most intriguingly, was Billy Bob Thornton's mean president in <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1041004,00.html\">Love Actually</a> really conceived as an imitation of the current occupant of the White House? This, inevitably, is anyone's guess. </p> <p>What's not in doubt is that Hollywood has taken a dim view of the Bush administration. One hunts in vain for a high-profile film that comes to praise him, not bury him. Mel Gibson's <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1017059,00.html\">The Passion of the Christ</a> might have struck a chord with the evangelical right, but no one - not even Bush himself - would be so profane as to suggest a parallel between Jesus's torments and the president's trials in the Oval Office. In fact, the film that Bush seems to have relished most during his term in office is the art-house Afghan picture <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1069513,00.html\">Osama</a>, an anguished attack on the repressive Taliban regime. That one, at least, did chime with his worldview. \"It's a very good movie,\" the president told reporters. \"You should go and see it.\" </p> <p>One imagines that Bush would also have enjoyed <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/features/featurepages/0,4120,1311287,00.html\">DC 9/11: Time of Crisis</a>, a gung-ho TV-movie that cast the administration as a band of God-fearing superheroes intent on saving America from evildoers - and shows the president (played by Timothy Bottoms) praying alongside his wife in the wake of the terrorist attack. The trouble is that Bottoms then went on to play a feeble, drunk-driving dad in Gus Van Sant's Columbine-inspired film <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,,1118020,00.html\">Elephant</a>. Inevitably this casting choice led some commentators to interpret Elephant as yet another veiled attack on the president. One way or another, the Hollywood is full of them.</p>",
  "<p>Walk into any campus in the country, and you will see compelling evidence that British universities are becoming more diverse. There are more international students and more from ethnic minorities; more mature students and more with disabilities. Admissions of female students have soared, and state school students mix freely with those from independent schools.</p> <p>On the surface, it might seem that the utopian vision of equal access to higher education for all is fast becoming a reality. However, if the rash of discrimination lawsuits in recent years is anything to go by, the potential for discrimination and harassment within the education system has never been greater. Now a number of British universities are hoping to nip discrimination in the bud by offering diversity training to students.</p> <p>Diversity training is already widespread for university staff, but this is the first time it has been extended to the student body. With fewer than one in 10 white Britons socialising outside their own ethnic group, the aim is to raise awareness of the advantages of social diversity and discourage behaviour that can lead to accusations of discrimination and harassment.</p> <p>The benefits for students can be enormous, according to Mike Hill, chief executive of the government graduate recruitment service, Prospects. \"Students with diversity training will be better all-round employees,\" he says. \"We live in an increasingly diverse society and it is obviously an advantage if students can engage with people from all sorts of backgrounds when they go out to work.\"</p> <p>Employment legislation is the driving force behind diversity training in the workplace. New laws are being introduced from Europe that will make it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the grounds of race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or age by 2006. Similar forces are driving the campaign to educate students about diversity. Under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, higher education institutions have a legal responsibility to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good race relations on campus.</p> <p>One of the universities in the frontline of diversity training for students is Harper Adams University College in Shropshire. The university is planning to pilot online diversity training for its business management students early in 2005. Following assessment and evaluation, diversity training will then be rolled out to the entire student body as part of the university's professional skills programme.</p> <p>Nick Gallagher-Hughes, staff development officer at Harper Adams, says: \"One of the requirements of the Race Relations Act is that we make our student body aware of diversity issues,\" he says. \"However, we are also looking at this from a commercial point of view. We wanted to get the message across to the student body that students with diversity awareness make better employees. An online training system seemed to be the best way to do this.\" Online diversity training will be discussed at a workshop at the Leadership Foundation's staff development conference in Glasgow this week.</p> <p>Along with a few dozen universities and colleges, Harper Adams is investigating the potential of e-learning as a tool to educate students about diversity. Harper Adams is about to join 15 other institutions to buy a web-based training module from e-learning consultancy Marshall ACM, which supplies diversity training to staff at a number of universities, county councils and primary healthcare trusts.</p> <p>\"Students are often given a lot of responsibility at a very early age,\" says David Marshall, director of Marshall ACM. \"For example, you might find a 21-year-old student warder in charge of a hall of 18-year-olds. Students in these situations do not always realise they have legal responsibilities when it comes to bullying and harassment. Even a minor situation could escalate into a scenario that has legal consequences for the university.\"</p> <p>For Brunel University in Middlesex, the main attraction of web-based diversity training was the ability to train large numbers of students quickly and cheaply using the university's existing e-learning infrastructure.</p> <p>\"We wanted to make sure that we fulfilled our obligations under the Race Relations Act to eliminate discrimination and promote good relations,\" explains Kate Smith from the university's learning and teaching development unit. \"However, it would have been very difficult to provide face-to-face training for all our 13,000 students. We already use virtual learning at all of the seven schools in the university, so we chose to deliver diversity training using the same virtual learning environment.\"</p> <p>Brunel is one of the first universities actively to roll out diversity training to students. As a second stage, the university is hoping to incorporate diversity training into the mainstream syllabus. \"We are looking at ways to reflect diversity throughout the curriculum,\" says Smith. \"We want to provide opportunities for students to develop intercultural awareness, rather than simply teaching students about other cultures.\"</p> <p>But isn't there a risk that increasing awareness of discrimination and harassment on campus will lead to an increase in lawsuits against universities? Marshall doesn't think so. \"Some people are concerned that this kind of training may contribute to a more litigious society,\" he says. \"But all we are doing is informing people of their rights. It is the organisations that don't offer training who are having problems at employment tribunals.\"</p> <p>Universities in the US have been training students in diversity since the 1980s. According to a recent study by the Association of American Colleges and Universities, more than 63% of American higher education institutions offer diversity workshops or courses of academic study that focus on diversity issues. The result is a growing awareness of the benefits of diversity on campus, claims Caryn McTighe Musil, senior vice-president of the AAC&amp;U. \"Diversity is now seen as being integral to excellence, rather than being in opposition to it,\" she says.</p> <p>Discrimination is an increasingly complex issue in the education sector. Many universities are facing accusations of discrimination in favour of students from state schools, after decades of preferential treatment in the opposite direction. With growing numbers of international students at British universities, racial discrimination is no longer simply a case of black v white. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act requires universities to promote good relations between all ethnic groups on campus.</p> <p>In partnership with the National Union of Students, the Union of Students in Ireland has developed into a major provider of diversity training. More than 12,000 students and university staff have been trained by the union since 1994. Thus far, the attention has focused on students who are studying to become teachers or social workers, but the University of Ulster recently extended diversity training to student union sabbatical officers, with plans to provide diversity training to the general student body from 2005.</p> <p>\"Sectarianism is one problem in Northern Ireland,\" says Anne Monaghan, community relations manager at the university. \"But we also have more and more students coming to us from diverse backgrounds, including international students. We don't see our role at the university as just being educational. We also feel we have a social and civic responsibility to promote good community relations and citizenship values.\"</p>",
  "MPs have turned on a councillor and vocal critic of the government's architecture watchdog, accusing him of waging a personal battle against its former chairman. <p>Adrian Dennis, Croydon council's cabinet member for planning, the environment and urban development, told a select committee last night that the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment was still too close to developers even after a government audit into conflicts of interest at the agency.</p> <p>Mr Dennis, a trained planner, made an official complaint earlier this year about Cabe's connections with the developer Stanhope, which is chaired by Cabe's former chairman Sir Stuart Lipton.</p> <p>The issue arose over Stanhope's proposal, which it still wants to build, for a regeneration scheme in Croydon's town centre known as Croydon Gateway. The council favours a rival scheme involving a sports arena.</p> <p>Sir Stuart resigned from Cabe in June after a government audit into Mr Dennis' claims and others. It recommended that Cabe should not be chaired by a developer.</p> <p>Appearing before an inquiry into Cabe's role by the committee for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Dennis said: \"The fact that the chairman has gone has not changed anything. There are still a lot of commissioners [at Cabe] associated with one particular company - Stanhope.\"</p> <p>But the MPs were sceptical. Former Tory minister Sir Paul Beresford suggested the Mr Dennis himself had a conflict of interest over the proposals because he favoured the rival scheme.</p> <p>He suggested that Mr Dennis had been \"personally abusive\" about unnamed people associated with the Stanhope proposal by referring to them as \"Mr Slime\" and \"Mr Dudd\" in a briefing to councillors.</p> <p>Mr Dennis later denied this in a letter to the inquiry's chairman Labour MP Clive Betts. He said those comments were unrelated to Cabe, but he admitted he had referred to Sir Stuart as \"Lord Tea Bag\".</p> <p>He also said that Cabe remains a \"gentleman's club of well connected individuals who will know and will have had commercial dealings with each other.\"</p> <p>At the committee hearing Mr Beresford said: \"It's become a personal battle between you and one or two people.\"</p> <p>Mr Dennis said that Cabe had been involved in an attempt by Stanhope to \"bypass the planning system\" by commenting on the Croydon Gateway scheme before it had been seen by Croydon's planning committee.</p> <p>Mr Betts asked Mr Dennis: \"Isn't it time to draw a line under this?\"</p> <p>He replied: \"That particular site has raised issues about the way Cabe operates.\"</p> <p>The MPs also heard a ringing endorsement of Cabe by the Royal Institute of British Architects, which claimed it had helped drive up the quality of building design.</p>",
  "<b> Dead voters could swing poll</b> <br> <p>A handful of voters in this year's US election belong to a constituency that neither George Bush nor John Kerry have made much effort to reach: the dead. What sounds like a textbook case of voter fraud is in fact a completely legal result of the early voting procedures introduced in many states, though laws about counting dead voters vary across the country. </p> <p>In Florida, government analysts estimated that, based on mortality rates and early voting figures, at least 20 people would have died since casting a vote. The number is likely to be relatively high in Florida, with its sizeable population of elderly people, and will probably be magnified by the popularity of early voting among senior citizens.

She regrets the suffering on both sides.'</p> <p>Yesterday Bild, which sells nearly 4m copies a day, ran an essay by the revisionist German historian J\u00f6rg Friedrich in which he attacked Britain's destruction of Dresden as \"senseless\". The \"massacre\" of 50,000 German civilians during the devastating allied raids contributed nothing to the allies' victory over Hitler shortly afterwards, he wrote.</p> <p>The paper ran photographs of German corpses laid out on Dresden streets and asked the question: \"What have the British got against Germans?\"</p> <p>Although no serious German newspaper has followed Bild's lead, they have recently reflected on what might have gone wrong with the Anglo-German relationship. Officially, relations between Tony Blair and Germany's chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der are excellent, despite the war in Iraq. The problem is at a more informal level.</p> <p>Last week Germany's foreign minister Joschka Fischer complained about the British media's portrayal of Germany as the \"land of the Prussian goose-step\" - pointing out that the popular image of Germany in Britain bore no relation to the modern reality.</p> <p>Diplomats on both sides are alarmed that youth exchanges between both countries have recently fallen away. Fewer British students are learning German than ever before - only 6,000 studied the subject last year at A-level.</p> <p>In her speech tonight the Queen - who apparently understands some German - is likely to stress the need for Britain and Germany to do more to improve contacts between young people. Her presence tomorrow, meanwhile, at an Anglo-German conference on climate change has led to speculation that the \"Green Queen\" has complained to Tony Blair about American's lead role in global warming.</p> <p>While the Queen is not known for making public her private opinions, officials in Berlin yesterday pointed to the fact that her Bentley has been converted to run on gas, and that several energy-saving devices have been installed in the royal palaces.</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices fell sharply on the world's energy markets yesterday as dealers speculated that John Kerry was on course for a surprise win in America's knife-edge election.</p> <p>With the Democratic challenger for the White House seen as more likely to conserve dwindling oil stocks, the price of crude dropped $2 before closing in New York $1.63 down at $50.13 a barrel. </p> <p>The last-minute polls have Mr Kerry running neck and neck with George Bush, adding to uncertainty in global markets. Analysts said signs of stronger exports from Iraq, plentiful stocks in the US and the prospect of a slowdown in China had contributed to the continuation of last week's 10% drop in oil prices. </p> <p>Dearer energy has been a factor in slowing the US economy in recent months, with yesterday's snapshot of manufacturing the latest data to show a weakening of growth prospects. </p> <p>Brent crude fell $1.92 to $47.06 a barrel, while American light crude dropped below the $50 level. </p> <p>Although industry in Britain bucked its recent negative trend, the snapshot of manufacturers in America showed expansion easing for the third month in a row at the slowest rate since September 2003. </p> <p>The US index of national manufacturing activity fell to 56.8 from 58.5 in September. A measure above 50 shows the sector is still expanding and one below shows it in contraction. </p> <p>Elizabeth Denison, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said: \"It's down for the third straight month after being at relatively high levels right through July, which is an indication that growth is moderating ... The report is another indication that we may be losing strength in the recovery.\" </p> <p>In Britain the outlook was cheerier as a similar snapshot of the UK's industrial sector showed healthy growth, in sharp contrast to recent gloomy economic data. </p> <p>In spite of this, economists maintained their view that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will not raise rates at their meeting this week. The latest survey by Reuters showed only one economist out of 45 polled expects the MPC to raise rates. </p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said manufacturing grew at its fastest rate for three months at 53 for this month and beat City expectations of 52. The CIPS said it had revised its forecast for September up to 52.3. </p> <p>Paul Dales of Capital Economics said: \"This survey will encourage the monetary policy committee that the large fall in manufacturing output in the third quarter, which dragged overall GDP growth down to just 0.4%, may prove only temporary. Even so it will not be enough to prompt an interest rate hike on Thursday.\" </p> <p>Although the survey showed that manufacturers are beginning to raise their prices, commodity costs are increasing more quickly. </p> <p>\"The bad news for manufacturers is that input price inflation is close to decade highs and, although output price inflation has also picked up, it continues to trail well behind the rise in costs, so manufacturers' margins remain under pressure,\" said Ross Walker of the Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>A separate survey showed a disappointing downturn in manufacturing in the eurozone. The region registered a large increase in input prices and a large fall in new orders, which economists said was \"worrying\". </p> <p>The eurozone purchasing managers' index for this month was 52.4, below forecasts of 53 and down from 53.1 in September. The headline indices for Germany, France and Italy - the three largest economies - all fell.</p>",
  "The election is so near, and the polls so close, that it's now a mug's game to predict the outcome with anything approaching confidence, let alone certainty. <p>A few months ago, I was certain President George Bush would be re-elected, after he easily won the battle to frame the central question of the campaign around security and leadership. It was like taking the first three rounds in a 15-round bout. And while I understand why Senator John Kerry had to establish his war leadership credentials, I felt that he should have used his own Democrat convention to get a sharper focus on the economy, where the administration has nothing like the success story that our Labour government can tell. That was like giving away two rounds. </p> <p>Little by little, however, the Kerry campaign has improved. While his attacks on Bush's Iraq policy were high-risk, they energised his campaign and the election as a whole. He started to rebut the Bush attacks with greater skill after the woefully slow response to the attacks on his Vietnam record (how the Republicans turned the Democratic challenger's genuine war heroism into a Kerry weakness at a key stage of the campaign is one of its more compelling issues). Above all, perhaps, he did well in the TV debates, probably winning all three on points, which gave him momentum and confidence. </p> <p>Yet say \"confidence\" and I swing back to Bush. As a campaigner, to use a well-known Bushism, he has always been \"misunderestimated\" - particularly in Europe, where people judge him according to our own politics, not the politics of mainstream America. </p> <p>Both sides have worked hard to register more people to vote. Higher turnout should benefit the Democrats. Historically, a bigger share of those last-minute undecideds tends to go to the challenger. Another round for Kerry maybe. As for the Osama bin Laden video, it plays both ways, but on balance probably helped Bush. </p> <p>But if it is too close to call, there is another question arousing debate in Britain: who would Tony Blair want to win? I saw a television discussion involving two pundits recently. Both were said to know the prime minister's mind. One said with certainty he would prefer Bush; the other said Kerry. The truth is neither knows. </p> <p>Is it really four years since the pundits said Blair was praying for a Gore win because he would not get on with a rightwing Bush administration, while American pundits were saying Bush would not get on with someone so close to Clinton? Now the charge is that Bush and Blair are too close. </p> <p>They built that relationship in part because Blair so studiously stayed out of the Bush-Gore race. But he was surely right to stay neutral then, as he is right to stay neutral now, despite Labour's natural closeness to the Democrats. If Blair drew up his own job spec, \"getting on with the US president whatever their party\" would be high up the list of requirements. He worked at his relationship with Clinton, and with Bush. It will be the same if Kerry wins. </p> <p>There is no doubt the Bush relationship has given him enormous political difficulties. But Blair believes they are worth bearing for the benefits a strong relationship brings to Britain, economically and diplomatically. The political hit has been taken on this, and won't necessarily get worse if Bush wins again. </p> <p>If Kerry wins, we will hear lots of media blather about how this isolates Blair on Iraq. But one of the first foreign policy meetings a new president would want would be with Blair, to go over plans, not just on democratising Iraq, but the Middle East peace process, the threat posed by nuclear proliferation, global terrorism and relations between Europe and America. Blair's statecraft so far tells you such a meeting would go well, that both men would make sure they got along and reached decisions that took account of each other's political realities. </p> <p>In many ways it feels like only yesterday that I was part of the Downing Street team, meticulously planning Bill Clinton's visit in May 1997. A lot has happened since then - including the fact that Blair is now one of the most experienced and respected leaders on the world stage. He will be as interested as anyone to know the outcome as soon as it is clear. But of this I am certain: he will have worked out a plan for both outcomes, and the minute the result comes through, he will begin to put the relevant plan into action. </p> <p>There are not many areas in politics where sitting on the fence is the right approach. But a US presidential election, for a British prime minister, is one of them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair's press secretary from 1997 to 2003 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Almost four decades ago, during the Vietnam war, the great liberal, Senator J William Fulbright, captured more eloquently than any recent commentary what is a stake in today's US presidential election. There were, he said, two Americas: \"One is generous and humane, the other narrowly egotistical; one is self-critical, the other self-righteous; one is sensible, the other romantic; one is good humoured, the other solemn; one is inquiring, the other pontificating; one is moderate, the other filled with passionate intensity; one is judicious and the other arrogant in the use of great power.\" <p>Which of these two Americas prevails today is a question of huge significance for us all. It can be seen in the intensity of interest across the globe and in the large numbers of Americans who say this is the most important election of their lifetime. The outcome will determine whether America reaches out to the world in a spirit of partnership or continues with its posture of sullen rejectionism. It will determine whether this misdirected war on terror continues to escalate into a clash of civilisations that puts us all in greater danger, or can be turned into an effective campaign to address the political causes of terrorism. </p> <p>It will also determine the course of American politics for a generation. With up to four supreme court judges likely to be replaced in the next four years, the occupant of the White House will be in a unique position to influence the direction of American constitutional law. A Bush victory would enable him to entrench his harsh, moralistic conservatism in ways that would be impossible to reverse for many years. A Kerry presidency would have less room for manoeuvre, but might at least stop the rot that has seen American liberalism in almost continuous retreat since the 1960s. This is a battle for America's political soul. </p> <p>For most of the democratic world, there are good reasons for wanting a Kerry victory. His promise to create a much broader international coalition against terrorism carries with it an implicit acceptance that the views of countries other than America must once again be made to count for something. To lead, he will have to generate consent. Even so, it is important not to exaggerate the extent to which a change of president would lead to a change in American foreign policy. </p> <p>In order to mount a credible challenge to Bush, Kerry has felt the need to pander to Republican prejudices across a wide range of issues. Don't, for example, hold your breath for ratification of the Kyoto treaty or a tough line against Israel's land grab in the West Bank. The limits of the possible will be determined by, among other things, a Congress that looks set to remain firmly in Republican hands. Whoever occupies the White House, conservatism will remain America's governing ideology for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>The reasons for this need to be analysed and understood if there is to be any hope of bringing America back into the community of responsible nations on anything more than an occasional basis. This is about much more than one administration and the policies it pursues. It is fundamentally a question of global power relations and the distorting impact of American primacy. As Fulbright argued: \"Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favour.\" Along with the preponderance of American power comes an unshakeable faith in the superiority of American ideas and an irresistible urge to act on them. The folly is to imagine that it could be otherwise. </p> <p>For Britain, this poses some uncomfortable choices. We could continue to pursue our \"special relationship\" in the hope that America behaves with enough self-restraint to avoid compromising other relationships that matter to us, most notably in Europe. This would certainly be easier with Kerry in the White House, but it would do nothing to address structural causes of America's lurch to the right. By putting fidelity to the \"special relationship\" first, we can only weaken Europe's collective voice and encourage America's unilateralist impulse, further souring transatlantic relations and leaving us exposed - the choice we have always attempted to avoid. </p> <p>The truth is that if we want a durable transatlantic partnership that works in the common interests of Europe and America, it will only become possible if Britain is prepared to abandon the illusion of \"specialness\" in its relations with America and give priority to the objective of forging a common European approach. This is not primarily a matter of treaties and institutions; it is much more a question of mindset. One of the most remarkable features of the Iraq war was the extent to which several European governments were willing to ignore the opposition of their own voters in order to support Bush. Like the native administrators of some colonised land, there is the tendency in parts of Europe, and Britain in particular, for the political classes to identify more with the \"colonial power\" than with the people they are supposed to represent. </p> <p>Tony Blair represents such an extreme example of this condition that it is difficult to imagine how a Europe that includes him among its leaders can ever hope to restore to the transatlantic relationship a necessary measure of balance. </p> <p>Yet what is the alternative? Michael Howard's adoption of a more critical position on the war and the Bush-Blair relationship is utterly unconvincing, and the Liberal Democrats, though sincere, are not yet ready for government. The only other potential prime minister, Gordon Brown, is still mired in third-way ambiguity, positioning Britain as equidistant from Washington and Brussels. Few doubt that he, like Blair, would have followed Bush into Iraq; yet even so, there is one important difference between them that at least raises the possibility that a change of leader might enable Britain to loosen the suffocating embrace of the \"special relationship\". It comes down to an issue of pride. </p> <p>It is entirely likely that Blair, in moments of private reflection, understands that he made an enormous mistake in selling his support to George Bush so cheaply. But even if this were the case, any public admission that he got it wrong would, at this late stage, destroy the little authority he retains. Consequently, he is obliged to plough ahead without any room for manoeuvre. Brown carries none of this baggage. The only limitations he has are the ones he chooses for himself by failing to signal a change of direction. Were he to do so, it would send a powerful signal to sections of the Labour party that remain far from convinced that a leadership challenge would be worth the trouble. </p> <p>Whether today's vote goes for Bush or Kerry, Britain and Europe need a fresh start in their relations with America. This will only be possible if we are prepared to take tough decisions and weather the inevitable storm of protest from Washington. The prize of a stronger and more balanced partnership between Europe and America is considerable. What it requires is an act of real leadership. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Clark is a former Labour government adviser </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Dkclark@aol.com\">Dkclark@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>All Australians flying into Britain take 24 hours to get their bearings and the Wallaby coach Eddie Jones must be feeling more disoriented than most. His normal habit upon entering a London hotel is to throw his suitcase on the bed, jump in the shower and attempt to antagonise Sir Clive Woodward, not always in that order, but yesterday he had to amend his routine. </p> <p>The good news for Jones is that, even in Woodward's absence, there are still advance psychological points to be scored and his gambit in west London, where the squad are staying for a couple of days before heading north for Saturday's opening Test against Scotland, was wonderfully cute. A novice might have attempted to unsettle Andy Robinson by name; the artful Jones simply sat back and wondered aloud whether anyone could fill the impossibly large boots of the previous incumbent. </p> <p>\"I think it's disappointing Clive's not continuing in rugby,\" sighed Jones, expressing what sounded suspiciously like genuine sorrow at his rival's exit. \"The role he's played in raising the standards of preparation has been enormous and he has left a pretty big legacy to the game. Hopefully I'll catch up with him over here.\" Short of actually shedding a tear, he could hardly have been more convincing. </p> <p>In fact, both men secretly enjoyed the ritual insults and the handy subtext was to remind all involved that Robinson now inhabits a far tougher environment. Failing that, Jones has plenty of other sly angles of attack at his disposal and is particularly scornful of the idea that England are somehow to be pitied following the rapid break-up of their World Cup-winning side. \"I don't think they're in a state of rebuilding,\" countered Jones, pointing out tartly that England have the luxury of hundreds of professional players from which to choose a new side while Australia currently select from a maximum of 90. </p> <p>\"When Australia played games after the 1999 World Cup no one was talking about rebuilding. Every time you go out on the field you defend that title and that's where England are at the moment.\" </p> <p>Under Robinson he expects a physical threat at the very least - \"He was a very hard player and the England forwards have generally played pretty hard under him\" - and it is clear Australia's failure to beat England at Twickenham since 1998 has sharpened their appetite to impress, with Jones refusing to reach for the usual excuse of tired legs and minds. </p> <p>\"Sides come out to Australia and New Zealand in June and complain about being tired but we're prepared for this tour. Mentally we're fresh and physically we're ready to go.\" He is also using the success of his country's cricketers in India to underline that the Wallabies' away form needs to improve and wants his men to play the free-flowing rugby which secured a half-century of points against England in Brisbane in June. </p> <p>\"We want to play our natural game,\" confirmed Jones, keen for his backline to turn up the turbo on softer European surfaces. \"We've come over here in the past and tried to play differently which hasn't worked so well for us. We've got to be courageous and play like we do at home.\" </p> <p>Even though the talented wing Clyde Rathbone is doubtful for this weekend's Test with a chest infection, the signs are already ominous for a weakened Scottish team.</p>",
  "<p>The achievements and innovation of business students across the UK were celebrated at the seventh annual awards for business and management students, run by the Association of Business Schools (ABS), last month.</p> <p>The 2004 awards saw a record number of entries in both categories: the undergraduate award, based on students' work placements; and the postgraduate award, which is given to a student who has formed new businesses or introduced new products or services as a result of their studies.</p> <p>The two winners were Elizabeth Penny, an undergraduate BSc student in international business with Spanish at Warwick business school, and Roderick Sutherland, who is currently completing a part-time MBA at Napier University and a part-time PhD in electronics and electrical engineering at the University of Glasgow. Each will receive \u00a32,500 as their prize and will also go forward to the National Business Awards on November 9, where one of them will win business student of the year.</p> <p>The ABS represents the leading 100 business schools of UK universities, higher education institutions and independent management centres, with a combined undergraduate and postgraduate population of more than 200,000 students. The awards were presented at the ABS annual dinner in Manchester by Professor Arthur Francis, chair of the ABS.</p> <p>\"These students join a long list of previous ABS award winners who have shown outstanding initiative, enterprise, determination and business acumen,\" he said. \"They represent just a few of the thousands of students at our business schools, many of whom will become the UK business leaders of tomorrow. We are delighted to honour young people who will help form a new generation of managers and entrepreneurs.\"</p> <p>Penny spent a year working for Masterfoods, part of Mars Inc, as part of her degree. She was based in Madrid, and her focus was improving the efficiency of the sales force. She trained the entire team in a new database and report formats - and all in Spanish. The judges felt she deserved the award for this alone, but her overall contribution to Masterfoods was described as \"outstanding\" and she has already been offered a job there when she finishes her degree.</p> <p>Second prize in the undergraduate category went to Niusha Koucheksarai, a BSc student in marketing management at the Lancaster University management school. During her year's work placement with BT, she managed internal communications with over 900 employees within corporate business, instigating an e-survey of employees and rejuvenating the intranet.</p> <p>In the same category, Rachel Montagu-Ebbe, also of Lancaster University management school, was highly commended for her work at IBM.</p> <p>In the postgraduate section, Sutherland was awarded first prize for his design and development of the intelligent audio analysis system. He will produce and market it through his company, Dynamic Innovations, which he established in April 2003.</p> <p>\"We're working on intelligent audiometry,\" he explains. \"We're developing a system that can test a person for work-related hearing loss with the same level of accuracy that they would get from visiting a doctor. It's designed for use in a work environment, by a non-medical operator.\"</p> <p>Dynamic Innovations is currently developing the product, ready for its launch next year. \"Any industry with work-related noise will benefit,\" says Sutherland. \"The Ministry of Defence, factories, bus and train operators, the building industry - the list is long.\"</p> <p>Hearing loss is one of the most common industrial injuries in developed countries: in the UK alone, it accounts for payouts of an average of \u00a3355m a year. The intelligent audio analysis system will, he says, be a cost-effective and flexible way for employers to screen employees' hearing. Revenue will be generated from the sale of audiometers and through the analysis of hearing test data.</p> <p>The idea for the system came to Sutherland after completing six months of service in Bosnia during the Balkan wars as a lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army. \"I had my hearing tested when I came back from Bosnia,\" he says. \"I looked at the automated system and thought: 'I could do better than that.' So I did.\"</p> <p>Fortunately for Sutherland, he was more than academically qualified to rise to the challenge. In addition to his MBA and PhD studies, he holds a BA in electronics, a BSc in electronics and computing, an MSc in electronics and electrical engineering, and an MSc in new venture creation.</p> <p>He sees his qualifications as an essential back-up to his work. \"If people ask why I'm in a position to know what I'm doing, I can show them my degrees. It's an excellent way to support the business. I am one of the best-qualified people in Scotland in the field I'm in.\"</p> <p>What's more, Sutherland's impressive array of degrees has been gained through part-time study. \"It's the mixture of academic qualifications and work experience that make me stand out. I never wanted to go into education full-time - it's there to support the work.\"</p> <p>The \u00a32,500 prize money will be used to buy test equipment. \"We've actually just bought a logic analyser,\" says Sutherland. \"It tests the operation of the micro-processor in the system, to check it's working properly.\"</p> <p>The money from the award comes in addition to \u00a3370,000 of private equity and government funding and investment for research and development. Sutherland wants the company to become the market leader in worldwide sales of screening audiometry equipment within the next six years.</p> <p>As well as the ABS awards, Sutherland has also won the Smart awards from the Scottish Executive 2004, the Junior Chamber of Commerce best business plan competition 2004, the Falkirk Action Plan e-business competition 2003 and an Enterprise Fellowship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh 2003.</p> <p>He credits his work in the Territorial Army, in which he has served for 21 years, as the secret of his success. As well as his time in Bosnia, he served six months in Kosovo. \"You wouldn't think business would have much in common with a war zone,\" he says, \"but in both you have to be used to change at short notice and prepared to work on your own initiative. They're more similar than you might realise.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>The Association of Business Schools:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the-abs.org.uk\">www.the-abs.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It's one of the most controversial theories in British academic life today. Mainstream opinion ranges from sceptical to frankly derisive and even its supporters - the Optimists, as they are known - are rarely prepared to come out in public and whisper: \"Things are getting better.\"</p> <p>Universities, they say, are embarking on a spending spree unprecedented since the 1960s: building sites are mushrooming on campuses across the land; decrepit laboratories are being refurbished and acquiring state-of-the-art equipment; extra staff are being hired and star researchers can name their own price in the transfer market. Students are having to pay more in fees, but the facilities, the computer support and even the chance of speaking to a lecturer during their three- or four-year course are all being improved.</p> <p>There is even a fringe group among the Optimists who argue that the government should get some credit for these developments, but that is seen as \"heterodox\" (academic code for \"tasteless and bonkers\").</p> <p>Naturally, the idea that Christmas has arrived for higher education in the UK is greeted by cries of \"humbug!\" by the lecturers' unions and the various groups of university heads. Battered by 20 years of cuts and mounting workloads, the troops can't believe that the quality of academic life is about to improve. Meanwhile, Universities UK and the funding councils need to keep up pressure on ministers to secure the sector's share of spending over the next three years - the last idea they want to gain ground in the Treasury is that universities now have enough money.</p> <p>It is only when you take vice-chancellors aside individually, and ask them about their own plans that the good news seeps out. And when, after a string of caveats, Michael Sterling, vice-chancellor of Birmingham and spokesman for the Russell group, declares: \"I have been a vice-chancellor for 14 years and over that period have had to preside over cuts and progressive reductions year after year after year. After 2006, there is every prospect of an increase in real terms - it's going to be a real pleasure,\" you have got to conclude something very unusual is happening.</p> <p>Over the next five years, a combination of factors is coming into play.</p> <p>Tuition fees of up to \u00a33,000 for home undergraduates in England will feed in from 2006, and although it will take three years before the full income is realised, universities can borrow against this income stream earlier. Virtually all universities are expected to charge the maximum for most courses, although there will be a market in discounts and bursaries; and the government has pledged this will be extra money, not a substitution for the present funding - and for a few years this should hold.</p> <p>(This does assume a general election next year does not bring the Conservatives to power or produce a hung parliament that throws out the tuition fees settlement. One vice-chancellor is telling his council members that it is their duty to vote Labour.)</p> <p>A massive boost to the science budget over the coming years is good news for the research-intensive institutions of the Russell group and the 94 group, though it will not be shared by the new universities. However, they are in line for money for improving teaching facilities and promoting links with industry, and they have also had to become more entrepreneurial in recruiting overseas - a market which looks set to expand over the next decade. Fees paid by overseas students to UK universities jumped 24% to more than \u00a31bn, the Higher Education Statistics Agency reported this year.</p> <p>Compare this with continental Europe, where governments are struggling to fund universities and are beginning the debate on fees. Many of the new staff in UK universities, especially in maths and sciences, will be lured from eastern Europe and Germany.</p> <p>Even compare the UK to the US. Harvard and Stanford are on a different planet financially, but the public universities, which educate 80% of American students, are being squeezed by state governments and are having to react with a mixture of cuts and fee increases. The University of California, Berkeley, currently suffering Governor Schwarzenegger's fiscal attentions, is a more realistic comparison for Manchester and Cambridge than Yale or Princeton, and the comparison is heartening.</p> <p>Bristol University, for instance, is planning to invest at least \u00a3250m, over the next five years, in new buildings, including a library and a life sciences complex, extra staff in key research areas and enhanced student facilities. Eric Thomas, the vice-chancellor, attributes the bright prospects to a decade of sound financial management and good fortune in the lucrative sale of surplus land. But he also praises government policy, which should mean \u00a320m a year extra above inflation for research and teaching at Bristol by 2008-09, plus an extra \u00a350m over four years for infrastructure improvements.</p> <p>Thomas, who chaired the government's task force on voluntary giving to universities, is also confident of reaping tens of millions of pounds from a new fundraising drive. \"We won't be on a spending spree and risking our hard-won financial stability. But we are looking for a step change, based on strategic, sustainable investments. These are exciting times. Our centenary is in 2009. By then, we aim to have strengthened our research, teaching and facilities to an extent that merits a place in the global top 10%.\"</p> <p>It is not just research-intensive institutions that are exuding confidence. Bristol's neighbour, the University of the West of England, is planning to spend \u00a3225m over the next five years, including a \u00a3120m freshers' village on its main Frenchay Campus, new cafe areas and a 24-hour social and resource centre. There will be about \u00a325m for IT to support students. UWE, with 25,000 students, can expect a big income in fees and went on a big recruiting drive for extra staff last year.</p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge, the richest establishments in the country, continue to be sunk in immemorial gloom, dreaming of Harvard's endowment. Cambridge tele-don David Starkey declares the university is in terminal decline, while the head of Trinity College, Oxford, tells the government to get its tanks off his lawns so he and his colleagues can go private.</p> <p>But elsewhere, optimism is stirring. Newly-merged Manchester has special circumstances that have given it a \u00a3400m war chest to boost research. Southampton is planning to spend \u00a3200m over the next five years, according to Bill Wakeham, the vice-chancellor. \"The problem has not been solved, but we can begin to redress the effects of underinvestment in the past and produce a better experience for our students, as they might expect, as they are having to pay more towards the cost of their education.\"</p> <p>Fees money of \u00a315m extra a year will benefit students in better staff ratios, improved lecture halls and classrooms, and IT support - a sizeable addition to the \u00a345m a year the university gets from Hefce for teaching at the moment: \"They will see something for their money.\" Fees will not come on stream fully until 2008-09, but Southampton, like other universities, can borrow on the strength of future income.</p> <p>Southampton has just reached agreement with the Association of University Teachers (AUT) on pay. Most academics will be better off, says Wakeham, though he adds: \"Their workload is higher and their rewards less than we would like, but it is a step along the correct route.\"</p> <p>The government's decision to pay the full economic costs of research will also make a big difference to Southampton: between \u00a35m and \u00a37m a year, estimates Wakeham.</p> <p>On Birmingham's turnover of \u00a3310m, an extra \u00a325m a year from fees will make a difference to staff salaries and numbers, as well as bursaries to support students from poor families, says Sterling. But he adds: \"Tuition fees are going to make a major difference, but they will still not put us on a level with the US.\"</p> <p>There, the average expenditure on each student is \u00a311,000, compared with \u00a35,500 in the UK; variable fees will bring that up to \u00a37,300. \"If we are going to be a world-class country for higher education, and we bring in international students very successfully, we have got to have resourcing to keep us at that level, so it does matter that there will be an ongoing gap.\"</p> <p>At Birmingham, the development office, set up three years ago, is now beginning to pay off and has brought in \u00a37m, adding to Sterling's optimism that 20 lean years are coming to an end.</p> <p>At Exeter, a member of the research-intensive 94 group, vice-chancellor Steve Smith, says it has just spent \u00a338m on accommodation and \u00a320m on research centres. There is \u00a333m more to come in the capital plan. \"It's fantastic news for students. The money we are spending is going into things that will benefit them. Higher education has been given a very fair crack of the whip and we have to see that the money benefits students, because they are paying fees.\"</p> <p>Luton may have little in common with Exeter in its students or its research profile, but it has secured big investment from Hefce for its knowledge exchange for business and spent \u00a39m last year, including \u00a35.5m on a media arts centre. Yesterday, the university signed a deal with the British School of Osteopathy to train its students - like many of the new universities, Luton sees health as a huge potential market.</p> <p>Speaking for the Campaign for Mainstream Universities (CMU), Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex, is \"reasonably optimistic\". \"If you look back 10 years, most institutions are in better shape than they expected to be. Vice-chancellors are naturally cautious - if not Jeremiahs - and there is always never enough. We can always do with more.\"</p> <p>Middlesex expects to spend about \u00a3150m over the next five years in addition to big investment in student accommodation by private partners, which will not be on the university's balance sheet.</p> <p>After three years, undergraduate fees will be bringing in an extra \u00a318m a year to Middlesex, a massive boost to a budget of \u00a3120m, and a much higher proportion than in research-intensive universities with similar numbers, such as Cambridge and UCL. On the other hand, it will not see much of the millions for science research.</p> <p>So it will be seeking a financial boost from abroad, bringing overseas students to the UK - as Middlesex and other new universities have done successfully for years - and also educating them abroad. In January, it is opening a campus in Dubai for 500 students, which it hopes will rise towards 5,000.</p> <p>In Scotland, too, the mood is buoyant. The money allocated by the Scottish executive went a long way to meeting the demands of the sector, said the convener of Universities Scotland, Professor John Archer, principal of Heriot Watt. \"There can be no doubt that this is a significant investment in higher education by the Scottish Executive and we can assure everyone that it will make a real difference. We have tried to explain, not only the competitive pressures Scottish universities will face over the coming years, but also how investment in higher education can transform Scotland for the better.\"</p> <p>But Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Luton, cautions: \"We're learning to manage in difficult times. One of the reasons we are managing now is that we cut according to our cloth and brought costs into line with income. If you asked the average academic whether things are getting better, he might not agree in the same way as a VC or board of governors. They are definitely working a lot harder and class sizes are bigger.\"</p> <p>He is right that none of this optimism appears to have percolated down to the people actually doing the teaching and research - there, traditional gloom continues to reign. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the AUT, says a decade and more of falling relative salaries and increasing workloads have left her members wary. The proportion of UK higher education institutions' expenditure on staff costs has fallen from 70% in 1976-77 to 58% in 2001-2, lower than in the US (62%) and well below the average for developed countries of 69%, according to the OECD. \"It leads them to be cynical until they see delivery - they have been owed it for a very long time,\" says Hunt.</p> <p>At the other lecturers' union, Natfhe, Roger Kline, the higher education secretary, is even more dismissive. The union is faced with redundancy disputes and constant laments from universities that they don't have money for more pay, he says, and he doubts whether either top-up fees or overseas students will prove a \"golden goose\".</p> <p>He adds: \"The workforce has seen higher workloads, larger classes and worse facilities. It's stopped getting worse in the last two or three years, but we are pretty sceptical about the idea that it's going to get better.\"</p> <p>Kline reckons we have reached the \"high water mark\" for higher education funding and that preschool and secondary schools will get the politicians' attention from now on.</p> <p>Well, that's a relief. Normal gloom will be resumed next week.</p>",
  "<p>Autumn really is not the time to get rid of little vices. As the nights grow longer and colder, it gets more difficult to turn down that chocolate bar, or to go to the gym instead of to the pub. But the fact is that we could all do a lot more to stay healthy, and a new \u00a312m initiative has been set up to help us along.</p> <p>Finding a cure for cancer may be one of the holy grails of medical research, but stopping people getting sick is better still. The National Prevention Research Initiative will fund multidisciplinary research that will help to cut the number of people contracting cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Projects will need to be directly relevant to improving public health.</p> <p>Reflecting the major environmental causes of disease among the population, the initiative will focus on projects looking at how to cut smoking or drinking. It will also provide money for studies on eating habits and obesity, and on how to get us off the sofa and onto the jogging track.</p> <p>The initiative receives its funds from a host of medical research charities and funders such as the British Heart Foundation and the World Cancer Research Fund. The Department of Health and its counterparts in the devolved administrations are also in on the initiative, as are the Economic and Social Research Council and the Food Standards Agency. Awards will mainly be made to projects that would have trouble finding funding on their own.</p> <p>The length of projects could be up to five years, and a number of different scientific disciplines could be involved, such as psychology or statistics. Proposals could consider the effects of the environment or an individual's life course on their health. Or they could look at the differences and inequalities experienced by different social, cultural, socioeconomic, ethnic and gender groups in society.</p> <p>A group of prevention research experts will assess the quality of proposals. It is hoped that this will stave off problems faced in the past. A consultation in the field of cancer prevention revealed that often, peer-review panels did not have the right expertise to be impressed by such projects. Researchers also found it difficult to publish their work in high-impact journals.</p> <p>It is hoped that the new initiative will raise the profile of prevention research and provide a national focus. But funding is only one side of the equation. You also need a strong research base to come up with ideas for projects. In the US, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a postdoctoral programme for cancer prevention research, which has been adopted by other universities and faculties. It also runs summer courses for researchers. This summer UK funders paid for three British researchers to attend the four-week NCI camp. Depending on their experiences, money could be made available for UK researchers to go on a regular basis. Ultimately, a similar course may be set up over here.</p> <p>Researchers wanting to find out more about the new scheme should come to the open meeting in London on November 12.
