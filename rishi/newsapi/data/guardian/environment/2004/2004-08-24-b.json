  "There is a meat market, where haunches of goat hang from the thatched roof. There are tea stalls and shacks selling hair mousse and skin cream. Some women dig vegetable plots while their neighbours shape clay and water with their bare hands to build new houses. <p>An enterprising refugee has even bought a satellite dish and set up a TV tent, where a crowd packs in every night to watch the Arabic news channel, al-Jazeera. </p> <p>The refugee camp at Iridimi, in north-eastern Chad, is home to 15,000 people who have fled the violence in Darfur. They are showing every sign of settling permanently across the border. </p> <p>There is a cross-section of Darfur society in Iridimi; peasant farmers and herders, but also middle-class refugees who are trying to rebuild their businesses. </p> <p>Juma al-Hamdar, 40, borrowed money from family in Libya and the Gulf to buy a generator-powered flour mill, where women queue each day to grind cereals. </p> <p>Sipping black tea, the businessman speaks quietly in English about his six-year-old son Ahmed, who was killed when the Sudanese government bombed the town of Kornoi. \"My baby died by Antonov,\" he said. </p> <p>Here he has a new life and a new child, Salma, who was born in the camp eight days ago. </p> <p>Stallholder Hashim Haroum, 23, who sells pasta, soap and lollipops from a shack made of thatch and tree branches, was a student in Darfur. </p> <p>But he chose to go into business in the camp with the support of a loan from family members who were already settled in Chad. </p> <p>\"If peace comes, I will return. But if not, I will stay here,\" he said. \"Business is good, thank God.\" </p> <p>However, the success of some of the businessmen can be deceptive. </p> <p>Life for the majority of the refugees is cramped and hard in comparison with Darfur - and conditions at Iridimi are better than at most of the other camps in Chad. </p> <p>Some of these are still struggling to provide food, water and shelter for all those who need help. </p> <p>The land in this patch of north-eastern Chad is drier than the fertile soil of their home villages in Darfur. Even in the wet season, less rain falls here. </p> <p>Swathed in a faded purple shawl, Asha Aliya Yahya hacks at the earth in front of her UN-issue tent with a dull knife. </p> <p>In a tiny plot of land no wider than the front of her tent, okra seedlings are sprouting. The sandy soil is stained dark brown with the buckets of water she has poured on it. \"[In Darfur] I had tools to dig the land, but here I have nothing, only this knife,\" Mrs Yahya said. \"This is very hard. </p> <p>\"We had a big garden, growing sorghum, okra, tomatoes and water melon. We had lemons and oranges. We ate the things we grew ourselves and had cows to give us milk and buttermilk.\" </p> <p>In the camp the refugees receive rations of rice, peas, sorghum and a nutritional supplement, corn-soy blend, which is mixed with water to make an unappetising yellow gruel. </p> <p>\"It is not good, because it is not normal food,\" Mrs Yahya said. \"Sometimes it upsets my stomach.\" </p> <p>Like many of the refugees in the camp, she came to Iridimi five months ago after Janjaweed attacked the village of Abu Gumra in north Darfur. </p> <p>When she speaks of the attack, in which two of her sons died, she pulls her shawl over her face so that strangers will not see her tears. </p> <p>Across the camp, refugee women are busy building new homes to replace or extend their UN tents. </p> <p>When it rains, Aziza Hamid Jabar and her children sleep in their tent. But because the tent traps heat, she has built an airy shelter of thick tree branches and plastic sheeting next to it, where she and her children sit out the fierce midday sun. </p> <p>A clay wall with a low doorway curves in a semicircle in front of her living space. Set beside the wall is an open-air kitchen where a cooking fire smoulders. </p> <p>But for her too, life was better in Darfur. \"In Abu Gumra, we had a big wall around the house and many rooms,\" Mrs Jabar said. \"We had a bathroom.\" </p> <p>These are resilient people, whose survival skills have been honed by a tough environment. They are accustomed to lean seasons in which hunger and disease will claim some of their children. </p> <p>But none of them will return to Darfur to face the bomber planes and Janjaweed militias sent by the Sudanese government. </p> <p>There are up to 190,000 refugees in nine camps along the border between western Sudan and Chad. </p> <p>A tenth camp is being built by the UN, which expects many more to cross as the violence continues. </p> <p>Digging at her okra patch, Mrs Yahya said: \"In my country, this would take two months [to yield a crop], but here I don't know because the land is not good. </p> <p>\"This land is dry, but it is better than before because there is no war here, no bombing.\" </p> <p>She added: \"If peace comes, I will return back, but I don't know when that will be. Only God knows.\"</p>",
  "Mahdi army fighters loyal to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had largely abandoned Najaf's Imam Ali shrine yesterday before American forces launched a massive offensive, which was under way last night. <p>Sources inside the resistance movement said the majority of the militiamen slipped out of the complex after a secret order by Mr Sadr five days ago. </p> <p>The cleric was no longer in the area immediately around the shrine, which was encircled by American tanks, they said. </p> <p>\"He is 100% not there,\" one source said. \"We are cleverer than the Americans think. Anybody who stays behind is likely to be killed.\" He added: \"We need these people.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr's aides insisted the cleric was still in Najaf, but many of his fighters appeared to be regrouping in the neighbouring town of Kufa, having been told that the battle for the shrine has effectively been lost. </p> <p>Their withdrawal preceded a ferocious bombardment by US forces of both Najaf and Kufa last night - and the largely symbolic arrival of a handful of Iraqi government troops near, but not in, the battle zone for the first time. </p> <p>American tanks were only a few hundred metres from the shrine, and had blocked off a strategic boulevard immediately to the south. </p> <p>A major American military operation appeared to be underway last night after a day of intense fighting. </p> <p>The streets of Najaf's old city echoed to the \"pop pop\" of machine gunfire. Overhead US warplanes circled continuously. Two Apache helicopter gunships flew over the vast cemetery. </p> <p>They also attacked targets in Kufa, where the crump of tank shells could be heard. Seconds later thick black smoke billowed above the old city. </p> <p>Yesterday Iraq's defence minister, Hazim al-Shalan, predicted that the battle in Najaf, which has severely dented the authority of the US-backed interim government, was entering its final, and possibly most bloody, stage. </p> <p>\"We are in the last hours,\" he told a news conference at a US base outside the city. \"This evening Iraqi forces will reach the doors of the shrine and control it, and appeal to the Mahdi army to throw down their weapons. If they do not, we will wipe them out.\" </p> <p>But Mr Shalan has made the same claim before, and last week Iraq's interior ministry announced prematurely that police were already inside the shrine. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Baghdad yesterday insurgents tried to assassinate Iraq's environment and education ministers in separate bombings that killed five of their bodyguards and wounded more than a dozen people, officials said. </p> <p>The environment minister, Mishkat Moumin, said she had survived a suicide car bomb attack on her convoy. \"I have been working on sending aid to Najaf and before that distributing water in Sadr City. Serving the Iraqi people is not a crime that deserves this,\" Ms Moumin told Reuters. </p> <p>The education minister, Sami al-Mudhaffar, was unhurt after a roadside bomb hit his convoy. </p> <p>The attacks were the latest attempts to kill government officials, seen as traitors by Iraq's resistance. The uprising in Najaf has plunged the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, into his gravest crisis so far. </p> <p>Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Sadr, Ali Semesin, told journalists the cleric still wanted a peaceful solution. \"We are still ready to negotiate to end this suffering,\" he said. </p> <p>Another of Mr Sadr's aides said shrapnel from an American attack on Monday night had hit the shrine's golden dome, one of its minarets and the compound's outer wall. The US said the Mahdi army caused the damage after firing a rocket that clipped one of the shrine's walls and exploded. </p> <p>Yesterday an official at Najaf's al-Hakim Hospital said at least two fighters had been killed and four wounded. Two civilians also died and two others were injured. More casualties were reported in the old city, where emergency workers could not reach. </p> <p>Mr Sadr has not been seen in public for many days, and police drove around Najaf with loudspeakers yesterday declaring that he had fled towards Sulaimaniya in northern Iraq. His aides denied that. </p> <p>\"Moqtada al-Sadr is still in Najaf and is still supervising the operations,\" Aws al-Khafaji, the head of Mr Sadr's office in the southern city of Nassiriya, told al-Jazeera television. </p> <p>US warplanes reportedly also struck the volatile city of Falluja early yesterday. Witnesses said it was unclear what the target was, but they reported flames and smoke in southern parts of the town.</p>",
  "I know this is a stretch, but imagine, if you will, that Ariel Sharon is one of those suave, high-rolling gamblers at a Monte Carlo casino. Slim in his white dinner jacket, he sips from his martini, his eye never leaving the roulette wheel. Standing beside him, one supportive hand on his shoulder, is his elegant partner: the Likud party. <p>Sharon is on a winning streak: each spin brings more chips to his pile. He calmly stacks up his winnings, calculating the odds. His partner is not so cool: she's getting excited. Finally, Sharon decides he has hit his peak; the heap of chips before him is not going to get any bigger. He wants to cash in his winnings. </p> <p>\"You can't leave now!\" insists his companion, firmly pushing him back into his seat. \"We're winning. Let's keep playing! Who knows? We might take the lot!\" Sharon is determined to quit while he's ahead; his Likud partner won't let him. </p> <p>OK, so the bit about Sharon looking slim in his tux is a bit fanciful - but that, in essence, is the situation currently playing out in Israeli politics. Ariel Sharon has spent the best part of four decades gambling for the prize that is Greater Israel: a Jewish state in roomier, more spacious borders than those that confined it until 1967. Bit by bit his pile of chips - in the form of the network of settlements that dot the West Bank and Gaza - has got larger. </p> <p>About a year ago he calculated that it was time to visit the cashier and realise his gains. Sure, he would have to leave behind the last prize on the table - the Gaza Strip - but, in return, he would be able to keep choice cuts of the West Bank. Not Greatest Israel, perhaps, but Greater Israel most definitely. What's more, he would do so with the explicit backing of the US president, defying all those who insisted that any gains Israel made after 1967 would eventually have to be handed back. </p> <p>Sharon reached his assessment by looking around the table. He concluded that his Palestinian rival was weaker than ever before. Ostracised internationally, faulted for failing both to improve security and to reform the way the Palestinian Authority does business, Yasser Arafat now faces an internal revolt. Last month it came on the streets of Gaza, with anti-Arafat riots; yesterday it took the form of a vote of no-confidence, slated for a meeting of the Palestine Legislative Council. Hobbled by long-standing accusations of corruption, the only peace process Arafat is engaged in right now is between himself and the disaffected within his own ranks. </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister also noticed a change in the demeanour of the dealer at the table. For years the US sought to be an honest broker, insisting it showed no favour to either of the competing players. But since George W Bush took up the job, that neutrality has been shelved. Washington won't so much as meet the Palestinian leader; meanwhile the White House's Middle East coordinator takes his summer holidays in Israel. With an election looming, and a Bush campaign determined to peel off at least some of the 80% of Jews who traditionally vote Democrat, Sharon gambled that this was the year when Washington would not dare refuse him. </p> <p>Taken together, these amount to the most conducive circumstances advocates of Greater Israel are ever likely to enjoy. Wait around and the weather could change, Sharon reasons, bringing either a renewed Palestinian leadership or a John Kerry presidency - either of which could revive the old demand that Israel give up most of the territories it gained in 1967. </p> <p>Sharon's reasoning is, in his own terms, shrewd, far-sighted and strategic. He knows that now is the moment to strike, when the Israeli right has a chance to achieve the closest approximation of its dreams imaginable. Gaza, a hard-scrabble strip of land with few of the biblical resonances stirred by the West Bank, will be the price - but the reward will be a US licence to hold on to all the key settlement blocs west of the River Jordan. Large Jewish cities standing on what is now fiercely contested occupied territory will be absorbed into Israel itself in perpetuity. Just in case anyone missed the point, Sharon underlined it last week by announcing plans to build 1,001 housing units on the West Bank. Lose Gaza, but tighten the grip on the West Bank: that's the deal. </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister must be cursing his Likud party for failing to see what a huge prize he is bringing home to them. Each time he seeks their approval, most recently last week, they rebuff him - convinced they can win all that he promises and keep Gaza too. They are being strikingly obtuse, denouncing him for abandoning the Greater Israel project when he is, in fact, about to entrench an albeit modified version of it, forever. </p> <p>It is clear enough why Sharon is pursuing this strategy. He is not a hawk turned dove, as some initially hoped. On the contrary, the Gaza pullout plan is aimed at keeping as much land as possible, while easing the \"demographic\" strain of ruling over too many Palestinians. Sharon's goal is the same as it ever was: he is just pragmatic enough to know a bargain when he sees one. </p> <p>Harder to fathom is the reasoning, even the basic stance, of the Americans. Saturday's New York Times reported that Washington had shifted its view, now tolerating some settlement growth while before it had insisted on a total freeze. On Monday, however, a state department spokesman denied any policy change, insisting that all settlement activity must stop. How to explain this contradiction? </p> <p>A starting point is to remind ourselves that the Bush administration is no monolith: the state department has long been less indulgent of Greater Israel aspirations than the Bush White House. It is hardly a surprise that they take different lines now. </p> <p>It's also true that Washington in 2004 is addressing at least two audiences on this issue. In an election year, pro-Israel voters are one constituency: the White House will hope Saturday's message in the New York Times reaches them. But next month Colin Powell will meet America's partners in the quartet - the EU, Russia and the United Nations - which authored the road map that calls for a settlement freeze. Monday's \"clarification\" is aimed at them. </p> <p>Not that anyone should be shocked if Washington has indeed given a green light to 1,001 new apartments on the West Bank. When Bush gave his approval to Sharon's Gaza plan in April, he said \"new realities on the ground\", made it \"unrealistic\" for Israel to give up settlements in major population centres. That surely gave Sharon his signal. </p> <p>With each day, the Israeli prime minister inches closer towards his lifelong goal. Ironically, the greatest obstacle in his way is the Israeli right, a Frankenstein's monster partly of his own creation. The Palestinians themselves pose littleresistance: they are too divided and too depressed. Never have they cried out more urgently for stronger leadership. What they need is a player every bit as shrewd as Ariel Sharon. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.freedland@theguardian.com\">j.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The recent flash floods in London and elsewhere, notably Boscastle, suggest these are set to become regular summer events (Country braces for belts of rain, August 24). Over the past few years, the loss to business has been substantial. One of the main problems in urban areas is the increase in hard surfaces - much of it at roof level. There is a method of ameliorating this: roof gardens. </p> <p>Traditional \"intensive\" roof gardens, as at Canary Wharf, are fine for large buildings, but for smaller ones, lighter structures, allowing plants to be grown in a shallow soil, can reduce rainwater run-off from the roof by 50%. More importantly, \"green roofs\" can absorb a significant volume of water before slowly releasing the excess into the storm water drains. </p> <p>Green roofs are a legal requirement on new buildings throughout most of Germany and Switzerland. A report by English Nature (<a href=\"http://www.english-nature.org.uk/news)\">www.english-nature.org.uk/news)</a> noted that over 200m square metres of existing urban roofs in the UK could be veg etated. In Germany over 13m green roofs have been installed, creating a \u00a3153m-a-year industry. The UK green roof industry is estimated at less than \u00a310m. The figures show how far behind we are. <br><strong>Dusty Gedge</strong><br>Director, <a href=\"http://www.Livingroofs.org\">Livingroofs.org</a> </p> <p>About 800 million people around the world suffer from chronic hunger and 2 billion are without potable water (Meat-eaters soak up the world's water, August 23). Add to this the trillions of tons of untreated animal waste that pollute our air, water and soil, and the massive quantities of fossil fuels required to put flesh on our tables and we are left with one of the biggest threats to our future survival. </p> <p>The International Water Management Institute recognises the importance of global vegetarianism, if we are to avert an international catastrophe; it is up to each of us to do our part (see <a href=\"http://www.GoVeg.co.uk\">GoVeg.co.uk</a>). <br><strong>Andrew Butler</strong><br> People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals </p> <p>You report attempts to save two species in the Lake District (Plight of dwindling Fell pony, August 21), one by encouraging the use of ponies instead of sheep for grazing on the fells; and the other, to save the rare Vendace fish, by curbing the growth of plants in the lakes. </p> <p>Grazing has been the disaster that has left most of the Lake District in such a mess. The effect of foot and mouth in 2001 gave the botanist the chance to see what was left after the sheep had been removed. The fact that scrub creates trees seems to be forgotten by most people managing this landscape. And these trees will stop a lot of the sediment, which boosts plant growth, being washed into Bassenthwaite Lake. The answer seems to be switch to the ponies, but graze them well away from the catchment of the lake. <br><strong>John Miles</strong><br> Carlisle, Cumbria </p> <p>One inch of rainfall generates about 2.3m cubic feet of water over a one mile square of land.

  "<p>It is generous of George Monbiot to put Tinkers' Bubble forward as a viable alternative in an ailing oil dependent society (An Answer in Somerset, August 24), but, as one of its residents, I feel his plaudits are premature. </p> <p>It is too early to say that our project works. We are only halfway to our aim of every resident earning a modest living from activity on the land. The farm is still very inefficient in some respects, and not as productive as it could be. </p> <p>One reason is that we don't use fossil-fuel powered machinery, but there are others: the problems of making decisions in a community; planning constraints that force us to live hidden in woods at the top of a very steep hill; lack of expertise; lack of ready infrastructure; and so on. </p> <p>A more critical eye might conclude that our mode of agriculture could never \"feed the world\". But there they would be wrong, for there are hundreds of millions of peasants who feed themselves using technologies more primitive than ours; and they have done so for generations, which is why they are better at it.

  "<p>The crucial auditing of Shell's global oil and gas reserves was undertaken by one part-time engineer. </p> <p>The revelation comes in the report by the Financial Services Authority, which describes group reserves auditing (GRA) of a key value indicator as \"deficient and ineffective\". </p> <p>Shell's decentralised structure needed a robust internal reserves auditing function. Instead, it \"had engaged as GRA a petroleum engineer - who worked only part-time and was provided limited resources and no staff - to audit its worldwide operations,\" the FSA says. </p> <p>The FSA makes clear that Shell's reserves difficulties began in 1997, the year in which former group chairman Sir Philip Watts took over as exploration and production director. In September 1997 Shell revised the way it reported proven reserves and revamped it again afterwards. </p> <p>A paper in May 1998, Creating Value Through Entrepreneurial Management of Hydrocarbon Reserve Values, set out new standards geared to helping it catch up with rivals' better performance. The FSA says: \"These revised guidelines resulted in an overstatement of proved reserves of 940m barrels of oil equivalents for the two years ending December 1999.\" </p> <p>Nigeria, where Sir Philip had been the boss of operations before becoming group exploration head, was at the heart of the problems. Reserves recorded on December 31 1999 relied on assumptions about improved conditions, such as increases in Shell's national output restrictions plus Nigeria's Opec quota. </p> <p>As the FSA says: \"These 'assumptions' did not comply with the requirement of the SEC that proved reserves are based on 'existing conditions'.\" Further overstatements came from Brunei, where reserves were related to field developments planned beyond existing contract expiry \"for which there was no reasonable certainty\".</p>",
  "<p>The British arm of Ilford, one of the most famous names in black-and-white photography, has been forced into administration. </p> <p>Over 740 jobs at the company's huge plant in Cheshire are in danger following a slump in demand in favour of digital and colour equipment. </p> <p>The company was formed 125 years ago by Alfred Harman making gelatine dry plates in the basement of his house in Ilford, Essex. </p> <p>In recent years it has been through a variety of owners, and is controlled by private equity firm, Doughty Hanson. </p> <p>Ilford Imaging has two manufacturing companies - one at Mobberley in Cheshire and the other at Marly in Switzerland. </p> <p>The Swiss operation - a legacy of when Ilford was owned by Ciba Geigy - develops and manufactures digital inkjet products. It is not affected by any form of insolvency and is trading normally. A further 310 Ilford staff are employed in marketing and distribution businesses in America, Europe and Australia. </p> <p>The US has traditionally been the biggest market for the monochrome films and developing paper produced by Ilford in Britain. </p> <p>Mark Byers, one of the partners from Grant Thornton appointed as a joint administrator, said the next step would be to try to restructure Ilford in the hope it could be made viable for sale. He said it was \"not inevitable\" that this would involve job losses but admitted cuts were possible as costs would have to be taken out of the business. </p> <p>Mr Byers said the pension situation appeared positive for the staff with no signs of deficits. </p> <p>\"It's important [for the employees] not to get spooked. Our understanding is that these defined-benefit schemes are fine,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>Ilford has spent the past four years trying to adjust to falling sales of black-and-white equipment. </p> <p>The company claims to hold 60% of the global market but overall volumes have been falling and were down 18% last year. </p> <p>Mr Byers said the figures for the first seven months of 2004 showed the overall market shrinking by 26%. \"This left the [Ilford] operation badly exposed,\" he said. </p> <p>Despite this, Ilford, which reports in dollars, has managed to increase overall sales volumes to $233m for the 12 months to December 2003. </p> <p>Doughty Hanson - recently involved in the float of the Umbro sports clothing business - is understood to have tried to sell Ilford quite recently but failed to find a buyer. The private equity firm was unavailable for comment. </p> <p>The fate of the Ilford operation was not recorded on the company website, which boasted only of its long and successful history. \"The efficiency of our plants in the UK and Switzerland - and the award-winning products they constantly develop are the envy of the industry,\" it said. </p> <p>Despite the problems, Mr Byers insists the Ilford name is a significant brand, with a particular following among professional and keen amateur photographers who prefer the artistry of monochrome pictures. </p> <p>Ironically the Ilford business is threatened just weeks after the death of Henri Cartier Bresson, a key exponent of black-and-white photography.</p>",
  "<b> Lit crit</b> <br> <b> Gained in translation</b> <br> South of the equator, according to a well-known Brazilian phrase, sin does not exist. But this doesn't mean it can't be imported: one of Latin America's most eminent journalists has accused one of Australia's foremost writers of behaving like \"a rude thief, a colonial predator, a privateer sure of his own impunity\". <p>The allegations about Peter Robb arise from his latest book, A Death in Brazil, published earlier this year to great critical acclaim. The book examines the sleazy 1990-92 administration of Brazilian president Fernando Collor. (The title refers to Collor's roguish money-man, PC Farias, who was mysteriously murdered years later.) Instead of being commended for bringing this corruption to a wide audience, Robb is being cast as a villain. His accuser-in-chief is Mario Sergio Conti, who was editor of Brazil's largest news weekly, Veja, during Collor's 1992 impeachment proceedings. Conti won an international award for his magazine's coverage and wrote the book Noticias do Planalto (News from the Presidential Palace) about the episode. Conti claims that Robb has plagiarised more than a dozen sections of his book, asserting that \"[he has used] systematically, not just the research but also [my] individual mode of expression\". </p> <p>The case is blurred since the sections, while similar, are not identical, and because Robb mentioned Conti's book in his appendix. Conti counters that the mention is inadequate. \"He just copied [my book] because it is written in a language that no one in the rich countries understands.\" </p> <p>Robb isn't talking, but an editor at Bloomsbury, his UK publisher, says she doesn't believe it's plagiarism since Conti's book is listed as a source. She describes Robb's use of the book as \"accepted practice in non-academic non-fiction\". Bloomsbury has nevertheless offered Conti fuller credit in the paperback edition. </p> <p>This is not the first time a well-known English-speaking author has been accused of plagiarising a Brazilian text. Booker winner Yann Martel admitted that Max and the Cats by Moacyr Scliar - about a boy adrift with a panther - was the \"spark of life\" that generated The Life of Pi, about a boy adrift with a tiger. Once Scliar read Martel's book, he decided it wasn't plagiarism. \"It was interesting to see my idea in another way. Up to a point it was an acknowledgment,\" wrote Scliar later. \"But I was disturbed by the controversy - which could have been avoided by a friendliness that is lacking even in the world of literature.\" <br> <b>Alex Bellos</b> </p> <p><b> Innovations</b><br> <b> Thirty miles to the pippin</b><br> Seasoned drinkers have long regarded scrumpy as \"rocket fuel\". One day, if environmentalists in Herefordshire have their way, the humble cider apple may also produce tractor fuel, lorry fuel and even car fuel. </p> <p>There should be no shortage of apples on which to experiment. The 2004 harvest promises to be a bumper one. And, says Katie Eastaugh of the Herefordshire Sustain Project, \"It looks as though there will be about 40,000 tonnes in this county alone that will not be required for the production of cider.\" And something has to be done with them. </p> <p>The Herefordshire Sustain Project is also battling to protect the 14,000 remaining acres of trees within the county's borders. More than 80% of ancient orchards have been lost over the past century, largely because of the introduction of trees and bushes which produce more fruit while occupying less space. </p> <p>A further threat emerged when the old family firm of HP Bulmer, which had strong roots in the area, was taken over last year by the brewing conglomerate Scottish and Newcastle, which has honoured existing contracts with apple-growers but not renewed those that have run their course. \"As contracts come to an end,\" Eastaugh points out, \"more and more orchards become vulnerable. If we don't find a market for them, they'll be grubbed up.\" </p> <p>HSP is convinced that that market can come from fuel. \"Two tonnes of cider apples will provide enough refined alcohol to process one tonne of bio-diesel,\" says Michael Wood, who also works for the Environment Directorate in Hereford. Wood, Eastaugh and colleagues are hoping to set up a small plant to produce ethanol from the fermented juice. \"The processing company will be able to use it instead of methanol, which is from a petro-chemical source,\" Wood explains. \"New legislative directives mean that, by the end of next year, just under 3% of all diesel must be bio-diesel. By 2007 the figure will have to be 6%. Our calculation is that there is enough surplus fruit to satisfy 60% of the demand for bio-diesel in the West Midlands.\" </p> <p>Fuel made from apples is carbon-neutral, he points out. \"It absorbs exactly the same amount of carbon that it releases into the atmosphere.\" It is also around 95% alcohol. Which raises the intriguing possibility of the vehicle rather than the driver being over the limit. <br> <b>Chris Arnot</b> </p> <p><b> Foreign affairs</b><br> <b> All the president's gaffes</b><br> With the current vogue for Bush-bashing, it wouldn't come as much of a surprise if an enterprising group of Democrats got together to build a museum as a testament to Dubya's ineptitude.

I think they're liars and someone should build a Counter-Bush library.\" </p> <p>Leboutlier and Erickson aim to devote each of the 16 rooms in the library to a different scandal. \"There's the National Insecurity Hall,\" he says, \"which will show everything he did to weaken security in the US - from cuts in intelligence funding to selling technology to the Chinese. There's a lot of instances where he missed the chance to get Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>\"But my favourite room is the Exit Room. After the Clintons left the White House, Bush's team found a lot of damage - computer keyboards had the W missing. We're going to re-create what the White House looked like after Clinton had trashed it.\" </p> <p>Asked to comment on the fact that Clinton saw 22m new jobs created, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the highest home ownership ever and crime at a 25-year low during his tenure, Leboutlier remains defiant. \"I'm not going to argue against the idea that some good things happened. But I believe the bad outweighed the good. And in his official library we're not going to hear about the bad.\" <br> <b>Alex Hannaford</b> </p> <p><b> Wired world</b><br> <b> Assistance at a distance </b><br> Bridging the divide between western society and the traditional commitments of an Indian family is tricky, as many an upwardly mobile expatriate has found. A computer programmer might be rolling in cash stateside, but what does he or she do when, thousands of miles away, an elderly relative needs day-to-day care or a family member requires help locating a birth certificate? </p> <p>In the past, the answer would have been to fly home or call relatives. But the former is increasingly difficult given the time-poor, high-pressure nature of professional jobs in the west, while the latter option, of hoping that cousins and uncles will help, has also become tougher, as the Indian tradition of an extended family living under one roof has largely disappeared: if the kids are not abroad they're probably working in a faraway metropolis. </p> <p>Now help is at hand: a quick email or free phonecall to <a href=\"http://www.yourmaninindia.com\">yourmaninindia.com</a> can solve your problem.

The cost is as little as a tenner. </p> <p>\"If it is legal, we can do it,\" says the 32-year-old. \"The most bizarre request was from a student in England who asked us to deliver 365 packets of noodles to his girlfriend in Punjab.

  "<p>Imagine the late John Lennon being used to sell trainers. </p> <p>That thought has become a reality after the singer's widow, Yoko Ono, agreed a deal with Nike nearly 20 years after the surviving Beatles were at loggerheads with the giant sportswear manufacturer over the latter's use of a John Lennon song in an advertising campaign. </p> <p>Ono has allowed the late singer's image to appear on a Converse All Stars \"Peace\" shoe, accompanied by his famous words \"imagine all the people, living life in peace\". Nike bought Converse, the canvas shoe company, last year for \u00a3187m.</p> <p>Nike, keen to exploit the shoe's status as a retro fashion icon, has engineered product placement deals for Converse in two big summer films, I, Robot and A Cinderella Story.</p> <p>Lennon's image will appear on the $60 (about \u00a333) trainer in the form of a self-portrait of the former Beatle perched on top of the world with the lyrics from Imagine, perhaps his most famous song, inscribed on the toecap of the shoe. Yoko Ono assisted in designing the shoe.</p> <p>The deal follows an outcry in 1986 when it tied its marketing campaign to John Lennon, angering Beatles fans by using the band's song Revolution in an advertising campaign. </p> <p>The surviving Beatles were powerless to stop what they considered commercial exploitation of Lennon's music because Michael Jackson had outbid Yoko Ono and Sir Paul McCartney for the rights to all the Beatles songs. Ono did not join the Beatles in their legal action to try to stop the Revolution advertising campaign.</p> <p>A portion of the proceeds from the sales of the Peace All Stars will be donated to non-profit groups that work to promote world peace. Converse donated $50,000 to EmpowerPeace, a group that promotes harmony between students in America and in Middle East.</p> <p>\"We are doing this because we have in our hands a global icon and blank canvas capable of unifying people in the universal pursuit of what is imaginable and possible: peace,\" said Jack Boys, the chief executive of Converse.</p> <p>Converse said it would issue a new, artist-designed Peace sneaker every year until world peace became a reality.</p> <p>The company is also celebrating its successful product placement in I, Robot, the science fiction film from 20th Century Fox starring Will Smith.</p> <p>The opening scenes of the film - set in 2035 - are a product placement bonanza, and Converse is the star. </p> <p>At the start of the film, the Will Smith character dons a pair of the shoes after taking them out of the distinctive Converse box in a sequence that includes a JVC CD player and a robot from Federal Express, the courier company. </p> <p>The shoe company also gets several lines of dialogue, when Smith's character's grandmother asks what he is wearing and he replies \"Converse All Stars vintage 2004\".</p> <p>The shoes also feature in another big film release, A Cinderella Story, the romantic comedy from Warner Bros.</p>",
  "<p>The government is facing a growing backlash from charities over a \"naked seizure of control\" of up to \u00a3700m a year of national lottery funding.</p> <p>Voluntary sector organisations gave a cautious welcome to the plans announced earlier this month by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, which set out how the Big Lottery Fund (BLF), the new body that distributes half of all the good causes money raised by the lottery, will work.</p> <p>But opposition to the plans has grown because \u00a31.2bn of cash will be handed out over the next four years under three themes - with linked outcomes - laid down by the government. </p> <p>The themes are community learning and creating opportunity, promoting community safety and cohesion and promoting well-being. Charities say this marks the \"assumption of government authority\" over lottery funding for charities.</p> <p>The BLF has been formed from an \"administrative merger\" of the Community Fund, originally set up to provide grants to charities, and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF), which has funded schemes in line with the three government priorities of health, education and the environment. </p> <p>Controversially, the government has often prescribed specific schemes that the NOF must fund, such as buying MRI scanners for NHS hospitals. </p> <p>BLF chairman, Sir Clive Booth, has stressed that ministers will no longer be able to direct funding in this way and that his organisation is not the \"NOF in disguise\".</p> <p>But angry charities are focusing on the stream of funding inherited from the Community Fund, which ran an open grants programme entirely independently of government priorities, with no equivalent of Ms Jowell's themes.</p> <p>The Acevo head of policy, Nick Aldridge, said: \"Rapid moves towards overarching themes suggest that decision-making in the BLF will be top down, paying little heed to the voluntary sector's priorities. </p> <p>\"We want the BLF to remain true to the spirit of the lottery. It should be genuinely independent of government priority areas, responding instead to needs identified by the sector.\"</p> <p>Stephen Bubb, Acevo's chief executive, has written to BLF chief executive Stephen Dunmore, saying: \"You will appreciate ... my members' present suspicion that outcomes such as healthier eating and better parenting, while very laudable, have more connection with present ministerial initiatives than any process of consultation with the sector.\"</p> <p>An email survey carried out by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo) found 88% of charity chief executives opposed tying lottery grants to the government's themes. Just 17 of 139 charity chiefs backed the move.</p> <p>Asked if they would support the retention of an open grants programme, just one chief executive said no, with more than 99% in favour.</p> <p>Charity experts, the Directory of Social Change, described Ms Jowell's announcement as \"the long feared, but unexpectedly naked seizure of control by government of what was once a stream of independent charitable funding\". </p> <p>DSC researcher Luke FitzHerbert said it marked \"the final assumption of government authority over lottery funding through charities\". </p> <p>The Community Fund had been about supporting charities in their own self-defined activity, Mr FitzHerbert argued. Now it has been \"completely transformed for charities to carry out government purposes\", he said.</p> <p>Mr FitzHerbert said he was not entering the debate about whether the government's three themes were good or bad. \"The issue is that they are government chosen, not charity chosen.\" </p> <p>Campbell Robb, public policy director at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: \"Whilst it is appropriate for government to be involved in setting the overarching themes under which the BLF will fund, it is completely inappropriate that they are involved in the setting of the specific outcomes these themes are set to achieve.\"</p> <p>He added that continuing an open access grant programme was \"vitally important\" and said NCVO would call for the amount allocated to the open \"Awards for All\" scheme should be expanded to at least \u00a3250m a year, with maximum grants of \u00a3100,000 a year. </p> <p>Vanessa Potter, policy and external relations director at the Big Lottery Fund, said: \"The DCMS framework is broad and flexible, and gives us a lot of scope to develop our funding programmes and the way we fund. We've made it clear to the government we would not welcome a direction that would force us to distribute elements of our funding in a certain way.</p> <p>\"Instead, it will be a matter for the board to decide how we will deliver against the outcomes and priorities the government has set us and in a way which maximises the benefits to communities. I am sure large elements of these programmes will be \"open\" or lightly prescribed.\"</p>",
  "Iraqi security forces today moved into the battle zone of Najaf's Old City for the first time since fighting flared in the southern Iraqi city nearly three weeks ago. <p>As forces advanced, a spokesman for the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said that he was willing to negotiate an end to the standoff. </p> <p>The Reuters news agency reported that Iraqi troops had moved to within 400 metres of the Imam Ali shrine in the centre of Najaf, where Mr Sadr's Mahdi army militia have been holed up throughout their ongoing battle with US and Iraqi troops. </p> <p>There was fierce fighting today as the joint forces moved ever closer to the shrine, which is one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam.</p> <p>Hours after Iraq's interim government had again warned that Iraqi troops would raid the shrine and end the fighting, Mr Sadr's spokesman, Ali Smeisim, told reporters: \"We are ready to negotiate to put an end to the suffering.\" </p> <p>The Guardian's correspondent in Najaf, Luke Harding, reported from the roof of his hotel - 2km from the shrine - that an intense bombardment of the Old City was under way.</p> <p>\"It's really, really relentless - there's a war plane circling above me, and straight ahead beyond the palm trees there are puffs of black smoke from the Old City, which has been repeatedly hit and pulverised,\" he said. </p> <p>\"To my right, over in Najaf's old cemetery, two Apache helicopters have been circling and re-circling all afternoon, I think just picking off Mahdi army fighters among the graves.\"</p> <p>Iraqi officials have said that any raid on the shrine would be carried out by Iraqi forces, because the use of US troops would inflame Shia opinion. </p> <p>The Iraqi defence minister, Hazem Shaalan, told the al-Arabiya television network the Shia rebels had \"hours\" to surrender, warning that a raid would take place if they did not comply. He said a raid was not imminent, but added the \"decisive hours\" were near. </p> <p>Iraqi troops would use loudspeakers to urge the militants to evacuate the shrine, Mr Shaalan said. The calls would continue \"for a long time to give another humanitarian chance for them to surrender\". </p> <p>\"If they don't ... listen to reason, then certainly there will be a very simple operation, a very simple raid,\" he said. Late yesterday, US warplanes bombed the Old City, a mix of streets and narrow alleys at the heart of much of the fighting, with fires lighting up the night sky. </p> <p>An aide of Mr Sadr's claimed shrapnel from the attack had hit the shrine's golden dome, one of its minarets, and the compound's outer wall. </p> <p>However, the US military denied damaging the shrine, saying an air crew had seen militants in the compound firing a rocket that clipped one of the walls and exploded 10 yards outside.</p> <p><b>Group claims to have kidnapped journalist</b> </p> <p>Meanwhile, an Islamist group today said it had abducted the Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni, who has been missing in Iraq since last week. </p> <p>The al-Jazeera television network said it had been sent a videotape in which militants gave Rome 48 hours to withdraw its troops from Iraq before Mr Baldoni, 56, was harmed. </p> <p>Another militant group today said it would free a Lebanese hostage, 27-year-old Mohammed Raad, after an influential Sunni Muslim group appealed for his release. The Lebanese foreign ministry said it did not yet have word about Mr Raad's fate.</p> <p>In the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, insurgents today targeted the convoys of the interim government's ministers of environment and education in two separate bombings, officials said. Neither minister was hurt, but at least five people were reported to have been killed. </p> <p>Later, a group linked to an al-Qaida ally, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said it had tried to kill the environment minister, Miskhat Moumin, and warned it would not fail next time, according to Reuters. </p> <p>A car bomb exploded in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Kadisea as Mr Moumin's convoy was passing through, environment ministry spokesman Dalal Ali said. Police and hospital officials said four people died and two others were injured in the blast. </p> <p>In a second attack in the western district of al-Khadra, at around the same time, a roadside bomb exploded as a convoy of vehicles travelled to collect the education minister, Sami Mudhafar, police said. </p> <p>Mr Mudhafar was not in the convoy at the time, but the blast killed a bodyguard and wounded two other people. </p> <p><b>Al-Sadr 'is still in Najaf'</b></p> <p>Yesterday, US soldiers engaged in fierce battles with Mr Sadr's Mahdi army militants, with explosions shaking the Old City throughout the day. Some militants were seen leaving Najaf, with at least two insurgents reported to have been killed and four injured. </p> <p>The al-Hakim hospital said two civilians died and two were injured, but more casualties had been reported in the Old City and could not be reached by emergency workers. </p> <p>Mr Sadr has not been seen in public for many days, and police drove around Najaf with loudspeakers, declaring that he had fled toward Sulaymaniya, in northern Iraq. </p> <p>The cleric's aides, however, denied the claim. \"Moqtada al-Sadr is still in Najaf, and is still supervising the operations,\" Sheik Aws al-Khafaji, the head of his office in the southern city of Nasiriya, told al-Jazeera.</p> <p>The fighting in Najaf, which began on August 5, has resulted in the deaths of at least 40 Iraqi policemen, eight US soldiers and dozens of civilians. The US military claims it has killed hundreds of Mr Sadr's fighters, but the militia says the true figures are far lower. </p> <p>It has posed a severe challenge to the government of the interim Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, who has attempted to take a tough stance against insurgents causing unrest in many cities. </p> <p>US warplanes reportedly struck the volatile city of Falluja early today. Witnesses said it was unclear what the target had been, but reported seeing flames and smoke in southern neighbourhoods. </p> <p>The US military, which routinely bombs what it describes as insurgent strongholds in the city, 40 miles west of Baghdad, made no immediate comment.</p>",
  "<p>I'd like to be fitter, honestly I would. I'm 37 years old, and a three-minute kickabout with the kids renders me a red faced, gasping wreck of a thing. The obvious answer is to exercise more, which is to say at all, and the obvious way to do this is to go to the gym. But - and I know I'm not alone in thinking this - gyms tend to be full of the kind of people who go to gyms. I know the exercises would be \"doing me good\" but the thought of being a bloke in shorts moving various bits of complicated metal to and fro, over and over again, in an effort to work up a sweat has me falling gratefully on to the nearest sofa. </p> <p>Which is where the Green Gym comes in. Run by BTCV (the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers), the UK's largest practical conservation charity, Green Gym groups offer a way of keeping fit in the open air by engaging in a wide variety of activities, from clearing woodland to building dry stone walls via repairing footpaths and creating community gardens. They are supported by the Department of Health and work in partnership with the likes of the relevant primary-care trust and local authority, to make exercise and improved fitness accessible to people who wouldn't want to set foot inside a gym - like me. </p> <p>There are 50 Green Gym groups up and running throughout the UK, all free. My nearest is based at Reddish Vale country park, which manages to create the impression of being a bucolic rural idyll while actually bordering inner-city Stockport. I'm joined, this drizzly Friday morning, by our project officer Jill Cunningham and five fellow Green Gym goers, a relatively small group as it's a working day. (On a Saturday they can get up to a dozen people.) What we lack in numbers, however, we make up for in enthusiasm, everybody else seemingly bursting with vitality. </p> <p>\"Today,\" says Cunningham, \"we're going to be cutting back along some of the Trans-Pennine Way and clearing some steps that have got a bit overgrown.\" </p> <p>Sounds easy I think, like an idiot. We walk to the tool store, load two wheelbarrows with tools for the job and set off walking to the site. Which is where the exercise bit starts to kick in. It's quite a long walk, the barrows have to be carried up some of the steeper sections, and by the time we get to where we're working I'm out of breath and sweating. And then we do the warm up. This consists of a few stretching exercises designed to a) prevent pulled muscles, and b) make me look ungainly and almost wholly lacking in coordination. I'm set to work, lopping overhanging willows that are crowding the pathway, and take the opportunity to find out why the others are here rather than pumping iron. </p> <p>Sian Howell, who is 37, has been attending Green Gyms since January. \"I can't remember my first session,\" she says, \"but I remember the second. It was freezing cold and we spent it shovelling shit. I was aching the next day. It was fantastic.\" She was originally drawn to the Green Gym by a desire to do something in the environment. \"I grew up in a rural part of mid-Cornwall and wanted to work in that kind of environment again, so this seemed like a great way of keeping fit. It's meaningful as well as physical.\" Howell says the idea of going to the gym holds no appeal. \"Not at all. This is exactly what it says it is. There's no posturing, everybody just mucks in and once you start you feel so good, and the other people are really great.\" </p> <p>Raisa Hovorun, who's in the country temporarily from her home in Italy, relishes the social aspect of the experience. She's 43 and naturally fit, listing cross-country skiing among her hobbies, but wouldn't dream of going to an ordinary gym. \"I don't like being closed in like that. I see keeping fit as part of a natural, living process. Coming here you really feel the effect on your body and mind.\" </p> <p>By now I've amassed an impressive looking pile of willow branches and the Trans-Pennine Way, or a few metres of it, is looking considerably clearer. More importantly, it's time for a tea break. Clearly a vital part of the Green Gym experience, today's tea break involves tea, coffee and eccles cakes - essential for an energy rush. </p> <p>Afterwards I'm set to work with a spade, skimming grass and weeds from the top edges of a flight of steps cut into the side of a steep bank. This is what is technically known as Bloody Hard Work; I can feel the effects across my arms, shoulders, back and legs. However, the sight of a clear, well-lit flight of steps at the end of the session, where there had previously been a dark, uninviting, overgrown tunnel, is undeniably satisfying. All agree that having something to show for your effort, something that can also benefit other people, is one of the Green Gym's biggest plus points. It's nearly 1pm now, nearly time to pack up, after what's been the most exercise I've taken in a long time; hard work but satisfying (when you're hacking away at grass with a spade it gets extremely personal) . </p> <p>According to research carried out at Oxford Brookes University, regular Green Gym sessions improve cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength by allowing people to work at an activity and pace that suits them. Felling or planting trees, or just plain digging, burns as many calories a minute as step aerobics. But this, in a way, is the obvious stuff. It's physical effort, and it's good for you, but it's provided in such a way as to appeal to people like myself. </p> <p>Perhaps the best example of the benefits provided by the Green Gym is provided by John Swindells. The 47-year-old was pointed toward the Green Gym by the practice nurse at his GP's when it became clear that he had to lose weight. \"I was offered swimming, an ordinary gym and this; and this was clearly the best. I don't believe in the proper gym itself - too monotonous. Here, we do something different every week. We've just finished clearing Himalayan Balsam - that was good fun.\" He's still somewhat overweight, but provides as much effort and enthusiasm as everybody else here. And does he feel fitter? \"Oh yes. Fitter by a country mile. I can honestly say this is the best thing I've ever done. Absolutely.\" And with that, he gets back to work. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more details ring 01302 572200 or visit <a href=\"http://www.btcv.org/greengym\">www.btcv.org/greengym</a></p>",
  "A businessman who benefited from a lucrative contract with the government for vaccines - and was later ennobled by Tony Blair - has donated half a million pounds to Labour, it emerged today. <p>Lord Drayson's firm Powderject made an estimated \u00a320m from a deal to supply the government with smallpox vaccines in the wake of September 11 2001, at a time when he had recently donated \u00a350,000 to the party.</p> <p>Today it emerged he had made a further \u00a3505,000 donation in June this year, just six weeks after being made a peer by the prime minister.</p> <p>The revelation came as the Electoral Commission published its figures on party political donations for the past four months.</p> <p>Although Lord Drayson's individual donation is dwarfed by the funds supplied by the trade unions to Labour, it is likely to prove more controversial. At the time, ministers denied any wrongdoing over the timing of the contract and the first donation.</p> <p>As Paul Drayson, he donated a total of \u00a3100,000 to Labour in the past, but the figures published today reveal that he donated a further \u00a3505,000 on June 17 this year. </p> <p>Three years ago Powderject won a government contract to supply TB vaccines as well as the deal to supply smallpox vaccines. </p> <p>The smallpox deal was mired in accusations of sleaze because Lord Drayson gave a \u00a350,000 donation to Labour while the government was deciding who should be given the contract. </p> <p>He was also invited to a private Downing Street breakfast for a small group of businessmen just as civil servants were deciding which type of vaccine to go for. </p> <p>Ministers insisted there was no connection between the donations and any contracts, which they said had been awarded simply because the company was best-placed to deliver them.</p> <p>A No 10 spokesman said at the time the breakfast was \"held as a private event\" and it was not \"normal practice to release details of meetings with private individuals or companies\".</p> <p>The publication of donations over \u00a35,000 is in fact an innovation brought in by Labour - through the independent Electoral Commission - in the wake of the perceived sleaze of the Major administration.</p> <p>Venture capitalist Sir Ronald Cohen also made a substantial \u00a3250,000 donation to Labour in May. Today's accounts show that Labour pulled in more than \u00a34m of donations in just three months. </p> <p>The party was given \u00a34.38m in the second quarter of 2004, according to accounts published by the Electoral Commission.</p> <p>Other notable donations revealed in today's figures are the huge increase in monies received by the anti-EU United Kingdom Independence party - up 500% in the run-up to the European elections in June.</p> <p>However, much of that money came from one millionaire Yorshire businessman, Paul Sykes. He donated \u00a31.2m - more than the total the Lib Dems received - of which \u00a3715,000 was spent on adverts. </p> <p>In total, the Tories' received \u00a33.6m while Liberal Democrat donations slipped slightly to \u00a3925,000.</p> <p>The figures show donations to the British National party fell to \u00a315,870 from \u00a326,014. </p> <p>The Green party boosted its coffers by \u00a383,435, up from \u00a336,646 in the previous period. </p> <p>Ukip's poster campaign helped it take third place in the European elections, doubling its share of the vote to 16%.</p> <p>The single-issue anti-abortion group Prolife received \u00a343,929, up from \u00a37,100, while George Galloway's new Respect party, reporting its first set of donations, received \u00a313,000.</p> <p>The Lib Dems later called for a cap on donations. The party's campaigns director, Lord Rennard, said: \"No one person should be able to exercise disproportionate influence as a result of extraordinarily large donations. </p> <p>\"In a democracy, millions of pounds should not be more important than millions of votes. </p> <p>\"There should be a cap on very large donations to all parties to avoid the suspicion that money is buying influence or favours.\"</p>",
  "In the ocean-fed air and mild August sunshine of America's most beautiful city, optimism flows easy. But the real mood-lift these past few days was in the windowless conference rooms of two downtown mega-hotels. More than 5,000 American sociologists, plus a few foreign scholars, held their largest and, many said, most vibrant annual convention for years. <p>Bush and Kerry were campaigning through nearby states. Their soundbites were rarely mentioned, but the lack of serious debate is one reason for US sociology's new political engagement after decades of quiet since the 60s. </p> <p>The profession's centre of gravity is moving left. There is a drive to inject ethical standards into the analysis of what most agree is a US society becoming increasingly polarised beneath its veneer of shared consumerism. </p> <p>Above all, sociologists are starting to challenge the intellectual stranglehold of American economists who have managed to get the neo-liberal model of competitive individualism and corporate globalisation to dominate public discourse and policy-making for the past 20 years. </p> <p>Words like \"empire\" and \"inequality\" popped up frequently at this conference after their post-Vietnam war dormancy. New phrases like \"the corporate state\" and \"global apartheid\" appeared. </p> <p>Half the world's PhDs in sociology are taken at American universities. The US has 13,000 career sociologists, a potential for extraordinary intellectual hegemony. They flexed their muscles last year, becoming the only US professional association to oppose the invasion of Iraq. A few unions denounced the war and even the normally conservative trade union federation, the AFL-CIO, passed a mildly worded vote of criticism. But with the exception of the sociologists, America's professions were coy about raising their collective voice. </p> <p>It was no accident that this year's conference theme was \"public sociologies\". It was chosen by the American Sociological Association's president, Michael Burawoy, a modest Mancunian ethnographer and sociologist who emigrated in the 70s. He distinguishes public sociology from professional sociology, which he describes as work aimed primarily for academic journals and peer review - \"solving puzzles\". It also differs from policy sociology, which is \"solving problems\" for mainly government or business. </p> <p>Public sociology, by contrast, is a conversation with society about values. Burawoy is careful to argue that it does not have a single orientation since a third of the sociologists who voted rejected the anti-war motion. He also insists that the three types - professional, policy and public - are inter-dependent. Without rigorous scholarly standards no public sociology will be taken seriously. </p> <p>Most controversially, Burawoy wants to \"provincialise\" American sociology. This may sound odd since US intellectual life has long been scarred by insularity. Burawoy means his slogan provocatively. The famous \"end of history\" claim that US liberal democracy and market capitalism were the only models left was a sign, in his view, that many Americans were trying to universalise the particular. They should realise their culture is not always preferred else where. To make the point, he invited high-profile foreigners like Arundhati Roy, the anti-globalisation campaigner, and Mary Robinson, a former UN human rights commissioner. </p> <p>Sociologists' relations with the state vary in time and place. The South Africans and east Europeans present were ex-dissidents who described how the advent of democratic and legitimate governments in their countries had brought new problems. Debate narrowed, intellectuals were less in demand and disappointment with rising social inequality and the new governments' economic policies was leading to public apathy. </p> <p>Jacklyn Cock, author of a path-breaking exposure of the plight of domestic workers in South Africa, called on sociologists to stand in solidarity with the new social movements. But she warned against romanticising civil society in the struggle against globalisation's injustices. \"The real issue of our time is how to reinvent the state,\" she said. </p> <p>Her point applies with greatest force in the US. Behind the rhetoric of small government, the US has created a monster state where political, economic and media power is dominated by corporations. America's political scientists ought to be taking the leading role in analysing this distortion of democracy but, according to their sociology rivals, their profession is in a conservative phase. It churns out graduates for the foreign service rather than critics who want to reform the system. Sociologists have to move alone. </p> <p>Four days in California are not going to change the world. But it was hard not to feel that something big is stirring in US academic life. The dominance of Reaganomics is under serious intellectual challenge.

  "<p>The UK independent television production sector, born in response to the launch of Channel 4 nearly 22 years ago, is going to change radically over the next five years. </p> <p>There are more than 1,000 independent production companies in Britain. By 2010, the proposed date for digital switchover, many industry leaders believe that will have agglomerated into a handful of all- powerful, US studio-style \"super indies\". The reasons are: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Deregulation of media ownership rules, which is attracting meaningful City money to potential merger and acquisition activity in the sector for the first time. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The rise and rise of the format, a trend that has seen a number of British production companies - Celador (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?), RDF Media (Wife Swap) - transform their profit and loss statements thanks to the international success of a bold programme idea. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The increasing influence that a select band of production companies have over the main terrestrial broadcasters, the industry's gatekeepers. Witness E4 and Channel 4's recent 300-hour output deal with Endemol, the maker of Big Brother, Channel 4's most successful show. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Changes to the terms of trade arrangements between broadcasters and the independent production sector. These have arguably swung the fiscal benefits of television in favour of production, convincing venture capitalists that production is a sector worth backing. </p> <p>Such potential for transformation raises serious questions for indie owners: which will remain standing; which will fall; how can they ensure that their indie survives; how can they turn it into a super indie? </p> <p>With talk of mergers, acquisitions and IPOs in the air, it would seem that now is the time to look ahead and presage some possible outcomes for the indie sector. </p> <p> <strong> Scenario 1: consolidation</strong> </p> <p>After unprecedented merger and acquisition activity in the sector, the independent production landscape is dominated by a handful of super indies such as Endemol, All3Media and Talkback Thames. </p> <p><strong>Who wins?</strong><br> The super indies: their financial clout means they can cherry pick talent from the BBC and Granada; their combined leverage ensures vertical integration (might Endemol buy a merged Channel Five and Channel 4?); their international reach means they have a stranglehold on distribution and foreign programme/ format acquisitions; and their chief executives become super rich as they ultimately sell out to the foreign media multinationals (Disney, Viacom, etc). </p> <p>The consolidation also benefits a new generation of hot super producer who, backed by the right agent/PR firm, flits from one super indie to the next, demanding the best deal for the next project. </p> <p><strong>Who loses?</strong><br> Regional production withers as these specialist houses are bought out by the super indies and turned into sweat shops for the smaller digital channels. A smattering of boutique production firms subsist, but most have either gone bust or been swallowed by the super indies. Those owners of regional production houses who sold live well in Tuscany; those who did not work in the regional sweat shops. </p> <p> <strong> Scenario 2: BBC production is privatised</strong> </p> <p>Under pressure from industry lobbyists and foreign investors, the regulator requires the BBC to sell off its production arm in return for continued licence fee revenue. Armed with a generous BBC and BBC America output deal until 2025, Beeb Prod is instantly the largest independent production firm in Europe. Truly a jewel in any multinational's crown, Beeb Prod is sold to BT for a staggering \u00a320bn. The figure sends shockwaves through the industry and, squeezed for cash as it languishes between the BBC and Sky, ITV Production is hived off as a separate (and independent) listing. </p> <p><strong>Who wins?</strong><br> Over time the super indies win because Beeb Prod is put under the same financial pressures as seasoned indies and struggles; or, as the guaranteed output deal tapers off, BBC broadcasting becomes completely open to independent production. </p> <p><strong>Who loses?</strong><br> ITV Production staff as the company's output is cut to key assets such as Coronation Street and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. BBC regional production also suffers as regional centres such as Bristol, Glasgow and Cardiff are shut as part of Beeb Prod's economy drive. As before, boutique indies without the resources or corporate heft to compete wither on the vine. </p> <p><strong> Scenario 3: brave new world</strong> </p> <p>The convergence of personal video recorders, analogue switch-off and a new generation of broadband televisions see the landscape transformed into something closer to today's online environment. </p> <p>In this brave new world, consumers cherry pick their entertainment from around the world and the super indies collapse under the weight of their overheads and ever-diminishing budgets as broadcasting switches to narrowcasting. </p> <p><strong>Who wins?</strong><br> Content libraries, as the new technology enables them to cut out distribution costs and sell directly to the consumer. Those hot super producers again, as the new technology means they can create their programming on a laptop and sell direct to the consumer. PR and marketing firms thrive because someone has to promote all this new content. </p> <p><strong>Who loses?</strong><br> Independent production companies vanish to be replaced by loose affiliations of creative talent that coalesce on a project-by-project basis. </p> <p>Of course the above is only speculation. Such speculation needs to take place if the sector is to be forewarned and forearmed. There are harsh realities, too, that both the sector and the City need to address if the rise of the super indie is to happen at all. </p> <p>Successful independent production companies do well to yield a 5-6% profit on annual turnover, not the sort of figures City tyros like to build their bonuses on. Further, the strong and independent personalities needed to run the industry may not like having their \"creative\" actions scrutinised on a fund manager's spreadsheet. It has often been said that you cannot put a slide-rule to glitter, but many an indie owner can hear that house in Tuscany calling. Let the bidding begin. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sean Kirkegaard is a creative consultant for channel Nation217. He is producing a session on independent producers at MGEITF</p>",
  "<p>Fahrenheit 9/11 is astounding. Not so much as a film - although it is cunning and moving - but as an event. Most commentators try to dismiss the event and disparage the film. We will see why later. </p> <p>The artists on the Cannes film festival jury apparently voted unanimously to award Michael Moore's film the Palme d'Or. Since then it has touched many millions across the world. In the US, its box-office takings for the first six weeks amounted to more than $100m, which is, astoundingly, about half of what Harry Potter made during a comparable period. Only the so-called opinion-makers in the media appear to have been put out by it. </p> <p>The film, considered as a political act, may be a historical landmark. Yet to have a sense of this, a certain perspective for the future is required. Living only close-up to the latest news, as most opinion-makers do, reduces one's perspectives. The film is trying to make a small contribution towards the changing of world history. It is a work inspired by hope. </p> <p>What makes it an event is the fact that it is an effective and independent intervention into immediate world politics. Today it is rare for an artist to succeed in making such an intervention, and in interrupting the prepared, prevaricating statements of politicians. Its immediate aim is to make it less likely that President Bush will be re-elected next November. </p> <p>To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite. </p> <p>This single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former. </p> <p>Ever since the Greek tragedies, artists have, from time to time, asked themselves how they might influence ongoing political events. It's a tricky question because two very different types of power are involved. Many theories of aesthetics and ethics revolve round this question. For those living under political tyrannies, art has frequently been a form of hidden resistance, and tyrants habitually look for ways to control art. All this, however, is in general terms and over a large terrain. Fahrenheit 9/11 is something different. It has succeeded in intervening in a political programme on the programme's own ground. </p> <p>For this to happen a convergence of factors were needed. The Cannes award and the misjudged attempt to prevent the film being distributed played a significant part in creating the event. </p> <p>To point this out in no way implies that the film as such doesn't deserve the attention it is receiving. It's simply to remind ourselves that within the realm of the mass media, a breakthrough (a smashing down of the daily wall of lies and half-truths) is bound to be rare. And it is this rarity which has made the film exemplary. It is setting an example to millions - as if they'd been waiting for it. </p> <p>The film proposes that the White House and Pentagon were taken over in the first year of the millennium by a gang of thugs so that US power should henceforth serve the global interests of the corporations: a stark scenario which is closer to the truth than most nuanced editorials. Yet more important than the scenario is the way the movie speaks out. It demonstrates that - despite all the manipulative power of communications experts, lying presidential speeches and vapid press conferences - a single independent voice, pointing out certain home truths which countless Americans are already discovering for themselves, can break through the conspiracy of silence, the atmosphere of fear and the solitude of feeling politically impotent. </p> <p>It's a movie that speaks of obstinate faraway desires in a period of disillusion. A movie that tells jokes while the band plays the apocalypse. A movie in which millions of Americans recognise themselves and the precise ways in which they are being cheated. A movie about surprises, mostly bad but some good, being discussed together. Fahrenheit 9/11 reminds the spectator that when courage is shared one can fight against the odds. </p> <p>In more than a thousand cinemas across the country, Michael Moore becomes with this film a people's tribune. And what do we see? Bush is visibly a political cretin, as ignorant of the world as he is indifferent to it; while the tribune, informed by popular experience, acquires political credibility, not as a politician himself, but as the voice of the anger of a multitude and its will to resist. </p> <p>There is something else which is astounding. The aim of Fahrenheit 9/11 is to stop Bush fixing the next election as he fixed the last. Its focus is on the totally unjustified war in Iraq. Yet its conclusion is larger than either of these issues. It declares that a political economy which creates colossally increasing wealth surrounded by disastrously increasing poverty, needs - in order to survive - a continual war with some invented foreign enemy to maintain its own internal order and security. It requires ceaseless war. </p> <p>Thus, 15 years after the fall of communism, a decade after the declared end of history, one of the main theses of Marx's interpretation of history again becomes a debating point and a possible explanation of the catastrophes being lived. </p> <p>It is always the poor who make the most sacrifices, Fahrenheit 9/11 announces quietly during its last minutes. For how much longer? </p> <p>There is no future for any civilisation anywhere in the world today which ignores this question. And this is why the film was made and became what it became. It's a film that deeply wants America to survive. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Berger is a novelist and critic</p>",
  "<p>By far the best perk of the job, the long summer holiday is the ideal time for teachers to ditch the routine and take a much needed break from the demands of working with children. But some teachers, it seems, just can't get enough. </p> <p>Raynah Thomas teaches English at Cockshut Hill school in Birmingham. For the second year running, she has given up the first week of her holiday to run a summer school for up to 40 new year 7 students. \"We invited students from smaller feeder primary schools, where there are only three or four students coming to us in September,\" she explains. \"We're a large, nine-form entry school, and settling into secondary school can be hard for these kinds of students. We aim to work on building confidence and making sure they are familiar with as many faces as possible when they start. Up to 15 staff are usually involved, so they also get to know some of the teachers, which really helps.\" </p> <p>Activities are based around a central theme - this year it was the Olympics, so students learned about Greek myths, theatre and mask-masking. The highlight of the week was an old-fashioned sports day, complete with sack races and egg and spoon. </p> <p>Prior to the summer school, Thomas invested many hours in planning activities and organising resources. Nevertheless, she looks forward to it. \"I do feel exhausted at the end of the term and I know I won't have a chance to relax, but it is nice to spend a week with a small group of kids. The curriculum is so prescribed now, it's great to have the opportunity to try out new ideas.\" </p> <p>Lisa Keane, deputy headteacher at the Jo Richardson community school in Dagenham, Essex, is not only willing to give up her summer holiday, she's taking 30 students nearly 200 miles to a week-long residential at an outdoor pursuit centre in Herefordshire. During the last week of the summer holidays, year 6 pupils identified as gifted and talented will join up with year 7 and year 8 students at the centre. For year 6, it is a chance to get to know some friendly faces, find out about their new school and meet like-minded students. </p> <p>\"For many of the children, it's the only holiday they get during the year,\" Keane explains. \"They're delightful kids and so appreciative of the opportunity. It's a hell of a lot of work to plan and administrate, then you're delivering the work and supervising the students away from home and organising follow-up work. But you get so much back during the school year. It really helps us to build relationships with the students and you find they'll really open up to you.\" </p> <p>It doesn't end there. The gifted and talented cohort continues to meet at least three times over the school year, on Saturday and evening projects. \"It is a huge commitment,\" says Keane. \"Fortunately the summer school happens at the end of the holiday, so there's time to take a break beforehand, but it's still an exhausting start to the term. But it's definitely worth it. Being involved in this kind of project sends out a powerful message to students. They can see that you really care.\" </p> <p>Peter Danson agrees. The business studies teacher has been involved with summer schools in Merseyside for the past four years. This summer was his second working as an overnight supervisor on the Next Step programme run by Liverpool Hope University College. This residential project provides over 1,200 young people in years 9 and 10 from schools across Merseyside, Cumbria and London with the opportunity to live and study in a higher-education environment. During the day, students attend lectures and seminars in a range of academic subjects. Evening activities include sports, discos, films, theatre workshops and Indian head massage. </p> <p>As an overnight supervisor, Danson helps run the evening activities and stays on campus to deal with any problems that might arise. \"On the first night, they can be lively, as they're often overexcited, but there isn't too much messing around. I usually manage to get a decent night's sleep,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It's a great project to be involved in, because the kids come from all kinds of backgrounds. A lot of the kids are from families where no one has ever been to university and they've never considered that it could be possible for them. It's amazing to see the transition they can make during a few days. At first, some of them just want to go home, but they soon start to mingle and by the end of the week, they're crying because they don't want to go home. </p> <p>\"This year, we had a 'bad taste' disco on the final night and everyone entered into the spirit of things and dressed up. It was great to see, as many of the kids lack confidence when they first arrive. Many said they were definitely considering university now and they're already planning a reunion next summer.\" </p> <p>Despite feeling jaded, Danson insists \"it's a nice way to end the year\". He adds: \"When you're at school, there's so much preparation and admin to be done, you hardly have a chance to concentrate on the students. It can be easy to forget why you're doing the job. On a summer school, you get the chance to focus totally on the kids. You feel you can actually make a difference.\" </p> <p>Fortunately, altruism is not the only incentive to work on a summer school - as Danson puts it, \"the money certainly helps\". \"But by the time it's taxed, it doesn't amount to that much,\" says Yvonne Rutherford, who teaches English at Corby community college in Northampton. \"But it helps towards paying for a holiday.\" </p> <p>And no one needs a holiday more than her. By the time the autumn term begins, she will have given up four weeks of her summer break. There was a one-week transition course for year 6 students at the start of the holiday, followed by a literacy week, also for year 6 students. She managed to squeeze in a short holiday and some planning for the autumn term before the last two weeks of her break, when she started running a creative and expressive arts course for 50 Corby students in years 6 to 11. </p> <p>The course, funded by Aimhigher - a government-backed initiative that aims to increase the number of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who apply for higher education - kicked off with a visit to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda) for a drama work shop. The remainder of the fortnight will be spent helping students to plan and produce a roadshow encouraging others to go to university. </p> <p>Staffing is tight: Rutherford has just three full-time teachers and three assistants to help her, but she insists she'll cope. \"It doesn't matter how frazzled I am, I get my energy from seeing the kids grow and develop,\" she says. \"There's so much more to children than academic achievement. You've got to work with the whole person. Helping them think for themselves and to solve problems is so important.\" </p> <p>As well as topping up the holiday fund, working at a summer school can also give teachers the chance to develop their professional expertise. \"Summer schools offer teachers new challenges,\" says Dr Graham Atherton, who leads the widening participation programmes at Liverpool Hope. \"We employ around 30 teachers over five different projects. For many teachers, working within a higher education context is a new experience and it helps them make better links to higher education when they return to the classroom. </p> <p>\"We also benefit from the pastoral experience they have to offer. Often summer schools are focused on particular kinds of students, such as gifted and talented or those at risk of leaving education, so it offers teachers a chance to specialise. And to give up your holiday time, you've really got to love working with young people, which has to be attractive to prospective employers.\" </p> <p>And far from draining teachers' last drops of energy, working on a summer school can refresh, revive and inspire, says Professor Deborah Eyre, director of the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth, which held eight summer schools this year. \"Teachers get the opportunity to engage young people with material beyond the confines of the curriculum that enriches both the teacher and pupils' learning experience. It reminds them why they became teachers and they can cover material they find personally interesting and share that enthusiasm. It refreshes the spirit as well as providing some new ideas for classroom practice.\" </p> <p>As Rutherford puts it: \"The personal and professional rewards are phenomenal. Don't tell my headteacher, but I'd happily do it for free!\"</p>",
  "'Never again,\" the Texas oil baron and corporate raider T Boone Pickens announced this month, \"will we pump more than 82m barrels.\" <p>As we are pumping 82m barrels of oil a day at the moment, what Pickens is saying is that global production has peaked. If he is right, then the oil geologist Kenneth Deffeyes, who announced to general ridicule last year that he was \"99% confident\" it would happen in 2004, has been vindicated. Rather more importantly, industrial civilisation is over. </p> <p>Not immediately, of course. But unless another source of energy, just as cheap, with just as high a ratio of \"energy return on energy invested\" (Eroei) is discovered or developed, there will be a gradual decline in our ability to generate the growth required to keep the debt-based financial system from collapsing. </p> <p>A surplus of available energy is a remarkable historical and biological anomaly. A supply of oil that exceeds demand has permitted us to do what all species strive to do - expand the ecological space we occupy - but without encountering direct competition for the limiting resource. </p> <p>The surplus has led us to believe in the possibility of universal peace and universal comfort, for a global population of 6 billion, or 9 or 10. If kindness and comfort are, as I suspect, the results of an energy surplus, then, as the supply contracts, we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack. In the presence of entropy, virtue might be impossible. </p> <p>The only question worth asking is what we intend to do about it. There might be a miracle cure. Photosynthetic energy, supercritical geothermal fluid drilling, cold fusion, hydrocatalytic hydrogen energy and various other hopeful monsters could each provide us with almost unlimited cheap energy. </p> <p>But we shouldn't count on it. The technical, or even theoretical, barriers might prove insuperable. There are plenty of existing alternatives to oil, but none of them is cheap, and none offers a comparable Eroei. </p> <p>If it is true that the Age of Growth is over, and the Age of Entropy has begun, and if we are to retain any hope of a reasonable quality of life without destroying other people's, then our infrastructure, our settlements, our industries and our lives require total reconstruction. </p> <p>Given that our governments balk even at raising fuel taxes, it is rational to seek to pursue our own solutions: to redevelop economic systems which do not depend on fossil fuels. </p> <p>For several years, I've been involved in one of these. Now that it has passed its 10th birthday, I think it is fair to say that it works. </p> <p>Tinkers' Bubble is 40 acres of woodland, orchards and pasture in south Somerset. It was bought by a group of environmentalists in 1994, and a dozen people moved in, applied for shares and built themselves temporary houses. </p> <p>They imposed a strict set of rules on themselves, which included a ban on the use of internal combustion engines on the land. They made a partial exception for transport: the 12 residents share two cars. </p> <p>Otherwise, the only fossil fuel they consume is the paraffin they put in their lamps. They set up a small windmill and some solar panels, built compost toilets, and bought a wood-powered steam engine for milling timber, some very small cows and a very large horse. </p> <p>Almost everyone predicted disaster. The Independent even claimed that the project had collapsed, after one of its reporters turned up on market day and found the houses empty. There's no question that it was hard.</p> <p>The first winter was spent wading around in two feet of mud. Some of the locals, mistaking the settlers for new age travellers, went berserk. There was plenty of internal strife as well. The work is tough. </p> <p>They fell trees with handsaws, heat their homes with wood, cut the hay with scythes and milk the cows, weed the fields and harvest the crops by hand. </p> <p>But they have come through. They have made friends with the locals, who are coming to see the project as an asset: the land is biodiverse, still has standing orchards, and is open to the public. </p> <p>Their stall has won first prize in the local farmers' market. They have learned, often painfully, to live together. Because it doesn't depend on heavy machinery, this farm, unlike most, isn't in hock to the bank. </p> <p>One hundred and fifty years after he published Walden, Henry David Thoreau is alive and well in Somerset. </p> <p>Needless to say, an army of bureaucrats has been deployed to murder him. Peasant farming, the settlers have found, is effectively illegal in the UK. </p> <p>The first hazard is the planning system. The model is viable only if you build your own home from your own materials on your own land: you can't live like this and support a mortgage. So the settlers imposed more rules on themselves: their houses, built of timber, straw bales, wattle and daub and thatch, would have the minimum visual and environmental impact. </p> <p>But the planning system makes no provision for this. It is unable to distinguish between an eight-bedroom blot on the landscape and a home which can be seen only when you blunder into it. </p> <p>The residents applied for planning permission and were refused. They appealed and won, but then the government overturned the decision. They took it to the high court and the appeal court and tried to take it to the Lords, in every case without success. </p> <p>But when they reapplied, the council, which had woken up to the fact that homeless people were housing themselves without costing the taxpayer a penny, changed its mind and let them live there. </p> <p>Then the environmental health inspectors struck. There are two sets of regulations in the UK. There are those which the big corporations campaign against; and those which they tolerate and even encourage, because they can afford them while their smaller competitors cannot. </p> <p>This is why it is legal to stuff our farm animals with antibiotics, our vegetables with pesticides, our processed food with additives and our water tables with nitrates, but more or less illegal to use any process which does not involve stainless steel, refrigeration and fluorescent lighting. </p> <p>The clampdown on small food businesses, on the grounds that their produce might contain bacteria, has been accompanied by a massive rise in food poisoning cases since the 1970s: large-scale production and long-distance transport provide far greater opportunities for infection. Tinkers' Bubble, which has never poisoned anyone, is now forbidden to sell any kind of processed food or drink: its cheese, bacon, juice and cider have been banned. </p> <p>But the settlers have learned to live with these constraints, just as they have learned to live with all the others. </p> <p>They haven't yet solved all their problems, but they have shown that a life which requires scarcely any fossil fuel consumption is still possible. It wouldn't work for everyone, of course, but it works. </p> <p>And one day, unless we demonstrate some willingness to respond to the impending crisis, those who live this way could discover that - despite the obvious privations - their lives are more comfortable than ours.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The government signalled a tougher British and European stance yesterday against the Bush administration's hostility to the Kyoto treaty when Tony Blair takes over the chair in both the EU and the G8 group of major industrial states next year.</p> <p>Ahead of Mr Blair's big September speech on climate change - the world's biggest collective challenge, he will say - a minister admitted the time has come for the government \"to move from words to delivery\" at home. Abroad it must also press Washington \"to be more ambitious\", he said. </p> <p>That amounts to confirmation that Labour has not done enough, despite brave words since 1997, and that ahead of likely British elections in the spring it must improve its record and distance itself from the White House. </p> <p>In a speech to an environmental conference in London, Lord Whitty, Labour's former general secretary, now an environment minister, told delegates, \"we plan to use our position in every way we can to push this agenda at a senior level\" in the EU and the G8, makingwhat he called \"a clear case for concerted action\" by the world community.</p> <p>With Mr Blair returning from holiday this week to start preparing his speech, and the environment featuring as a sensitive issue in the Bush-Kerry presidential race, Lord Whitty had to tread a diplomatic course yesterday and was careful to praise US research.</p> <p>He continued: \"But research and development is not a substitute for taking concerted action to reduce emissions now. We know enough about climate change to know that if we do not act now, we will need to make more drastic changes later.\"</p> <p>In answer to questions about aircraft pollution he admitted he personally favours a pan-European, preferably, a global tax to tackle a fast-growing problem. Aviation fuel is untaxed. </p> <p>That is no more likely to appeal to the US aviation lobby than Lord Whitty's confirmation that Mr Blair's chairmanship will press for the start of an EU emissions trading scheme and tackle EU aviation emissions. </p> <p>He claimed that UK air pollution is much less dangerous than in the 50s, when winter smog killed 4,000 Londoners, but admitted a new hazard - summer smog - had caused the premature death of 769 people in England and Wales in August last year.</p> <p>Lord Whitty also endorsed the views of a German academic at the conference that aerosol emissions, widely condemned, may actually be helping to cool the planet, acting as a temporary cover for the ozone hole. If aerosol use is stopped, as environmentalists want, it could bring unwanted side-effects, the conference heard.</p> <p>Lord Whitty praised the UN environmental programme, now headed by the respected former German minister, Klaus Topfer. He also warned Moscow - whose long-pledged support for Kyoto has still not materialised - that hopes that climate change \"would be good for Russia\" are wrong.</p> <p>But ministers know that they are failing to meet Labour's 1997 target to cut by 20% carbon dioxide emissions by 2010, well ahead of the Kyoto target of 12.5% for all greenhouse gases. The target has been scaled down to a \"goal\" which may be missed by 5% or more. </p> <p>Ministers have also been slower than most EU members to embrace renewable energy sources - notably wind power - in line with well-aired hostility within the Bush administration. A 10% UK reliance on renewables by 2010 is another target the government will miss. </p> <p>Mr Blair wants climate change and Africa to be the main themes of his international roles in the G8 and EU next year.</p>",
  "It's midnight at the Hyatt Regency hotel in the Spanish resort of La Manga Club and the bars are packed with British middle classes revelling, but only mutedly. In Spike's, there's a band doing what the generous would call a spirited rendition of Beyonc\u00e9's Crazy in Love. A bemulleted white man is trying to rap like Jay-Z with undeniable gusto, while a singer gamely belts and warbles over taped horns. The dance floor is occupied by that rare sight, sartorially blameless Britons abroad, some singing \"Uh oh uh oh. Uh-oh-oh-oh,\" at the right moments. <p>In the Lorca bar, 57-year-old pianist Brian Chapman, who has been entertaining people here for decades, boldly segues from Cockney Rebel's Come Up and See Me to Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds. Barry and Susan Jones, accountants from Reading, sing along from their table, misquoting Steve Harley and mangling the tune, while their teenage children stare blankly into the middle distance. There really ought to be decisive action against these kinds of public outrage, but as yet the authorities on the Costa Calida have not seen fit to tackle the problem. </p> <p>In any case, the Hyatt has witnessed uglier scenes - most of them involving footballers. Four years ago, the then Leicester City striker Stan Collymore let off a fire extinguisher and team mates were said to have terrified 40 guests in the Lorca bar, allegedly harassing women and dancing on tables. </p> <p>\"We threw the team out after that incident and vowed never to let Leicester City back,\" says La Manga Club's managing director, Tony Coles. \"But, sadly for us, we changed our minds because we were assured that they could behave responsibly.\" </p> <p>There was also the incident in 1998 when Paul Gascoigne, unable to master his emotions in the traditional British manner after being left out of the England World Cup squad, was reported to have trashed his room at the Hyatt. \"That was blown out of all proportion,\" says Coles. \"He didn't trash his room. He kicked a chair. If I'd been left out of the squad, I'd have kicked a chair. Wouldn't you?\" </p> <p>Then there were reports last year that the Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand had brawled with hotel staff. But worst of all, there was the incident in February of this year when Leicester City (again) arrived at La Manga for a mid-season break in the sun. Their stay came to a grubby end when three players were accused by three women of sexual assault in the Hyatt. Spanish authorities eventually dropped the charges against Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie, but only after the men spent a week in jail. </p> <p>\"When we looked at the security tapes, we saw just three ordinary women who looked like they had come for the weekend with some Scandinavian friends,\" says Coles. Were they prostitutes? \"There are no prostitutes here and no drugs - in so far as you can guarantee those things. We knew those guys had done nothing illegal but we couldn't say anything at the time because of sub judice rules in Spain.\" </p> <p>He says that there were no cancellations as a result of the adverse publicity, and that currently the resort is at 90% occupancy. But these incidents have given La Manga Club - a resort sprawling amid the lemon groves, bougainvillea and rock gullies of south-eastern Spain with spectacular views over the Mediterranean - a raffish reputation. Now La Manga's owner, P&amp;O, has announced that it is going to sell the resort, valued at \u00a3100m. prompting a renewed rash of headlines about its seamy past. </p> <p>The British press, fans complain, never accentuate the positive about La Manga. Beyond the security checkpoint, this aspirational 1,220-acre resort has three championship golf courses, a 28-court tennis centre, a state-of-the art spa, terrace restaurants and bars, secluded beach, horse-riding and diving facilities. </p> <p>It has been, footballers notwithstanding, a very British, and a very middle-class, kind of touristic paradise. Brits come here to mingle with their own kind and never have to speak a word of Spanish. There's crown-green bowling and Sky TV is readily available in bars and hotels. \"If people want to come here from Britain for a holiday,\" argues Coles, \"have very little to do with Spanish culture but stay in their apartments or hotel rooms or bars watching Sky TV why shouldn't they?\" </p> <p>La Manga Club is, like ClubMed, part of a global trend towards huge resorts for the upwardly mobile tourist. They are designed as places where you can check out any time you like but, thanks to all the manifold facilities on offer, you never want to leave. In La Manga, the leisure equivalent of a gated estate, the well-to-do can hole up for some decorous rest and relaxation without the riff-raff getting in to spoil their holidays or menace their kids. Clearly they are not for everyone: especially not for those who go abroad to get away from the British. </p> <p>The resort has been supplying tennis, golf, diving, horse riding and pool side-lounging holidays for more than three decades. Generations of Brits have bought up their little bits of Spanish paradise here in the form of 1,675 apartments and villas - and have have seen three-fold equity gains in the past decade. Formula One champion Nigel Mansell lives quietly in a villa here, Bruce Forsyth is no stranger to the resort's golf courses, and even Bianca from EastEnders chose to get married at La Manga, arranging it so that she was discreetly screened from public and press with a barrage of golfing umbrellas. </p> <p>But the footballing scandals have undeniably tarnished the resort's reputation. One newspaper called it \"a middle-management Faliraki\"; but while Faliraki is the home of binge-drinking, high-jinksing, mass-vomiting Brits, La Manga's clientele for the most part behave discreetly and, if wealthy, do not flaunt their wherewithal. True, there are some villas at La Manga that are valued at \u00a332m and the best suite in the five-star Hyatt costs more than \u00a3750 a night, but for the most part this is a middle-class resort. Two- bedroom apartments can be bought for \u00a3150,000. Self-catering accommodation can be had for as little as \u00a340 per night. </p> <p>And the raffish reputation is also broadly unfair. True, at the local airport (Murcia) one may glimpse a young British teenage girl with her mother, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a football and the characteristically charmless FCUK slogan \"Wanna find my penalty spot?\", but La Manga's clientele, on the basis of what I saw, eschews such vulgarity. It's the kind of place where if, after winning a match on one of the clay courts, you pull off your shirt in celebration, you might well be quietly told to put it back on. </p> <p>Terry and Joan Prudhoe, from Hertfordshire, are on their way to a morning of tennis coaching, having deposited their daughter at the mini-club creche at a cost of \u00a350 for the day. He is an estate agent, she is in IT, and this is the second time they have stayed for a week's holiday. \"It's got everything for us in terms of activities. It feels really safe for kids, and there's lots for them to do,\" says Joan. \"We've become quite besotted with the place.\" The couple are considering buying a villa there. </p> <p>Many Brits have done so already. There are some French, Dutch and Scandinavians, but the resort is overwhelmingly British - they own more than 85% of the property and account for more than 60% of the resort's business. </p> <p>La Manga was established in the near-desert landscape in 1972 as a golf resort by an American investor. At the time there was scarcely any road infrastructure and only one flight a week from Britain. Today, the region is well served with pristine motorways and frequent, low-cost flights from Britain for as little as \u00a350 each way - services that have accelerated the resort's development since the late 1990s. </p> <p>Under P&amp;O's ownership, La Manga Club became not just a golf resort but a real-estate and holiday haven. Although established 32 years ago, it only went into profit five years ago (last year it made \u00a35m), and is continuing to expand with new villa developments and a spa that opened in March. There are plans for La Manga to eat further into the Spanish countryside, taking over 84 acres of land for commerical or residential development. It seems, then, on the face of it, a strange time for P&amp;O to put it up for sale - unless the decision was prompted by the lurid stories involving off-duty footballers. \"No, that's complete rubbish,\" says Lorenzo Martinez, La Manga's director of tennis and leisure. \"P&amp;O has been planning to sell the place for about a year - long before the Leicester City thing.\" It is more likely the sale is part of a global retrenchment aimed at helping the loss-making company focus on its core business of port management and ferries. Three P&amp;O-owned resorts in Australia have been sold off, and the company is also to dispose of the \u00a349m Manchester Arena. </p> <p>But who will buy La Manga? Of course, any great rich galoot could tranform it from an aspirational playground for muted England, into something that its current clientele would regard as hideous. It could become a new EuroDisney, sucking in Brits from Benidorm to Malaga. \"We are worried, of course we are, about what the future holds,\" says Martinez. \"Not just people like me but all of the 650 staff and a lot of the people who stay and live here. It's too lovely a place to be ruined.\" </p> <p>Unless of course, you think La Manga Club is a blot on a landscape, a testament to the banality of the middle class's hedonisitic dreams, and a place that would do better to become desert once more.</p>",
  "The search for the reasons behind Paula Radcliffe's disastrous performance in the Olympic marathon moved yesterday to a medical laboratory in Athens, where blood samples taken from the 30-year-old athlete were being analysed in the hope of discovering some medical explanation for the exhaustion that forced her to come to a halt at the side of the road with four miles of the race still to run. <p>Too distressed to utter more than a single word - \"Devastated\" - in the immediate aftermath of her withdrawal, a pale and red-eyed Radcliffe emerged yesterday to give her version of the events that ended the attempt to crown her career with a gold medal. </p> <p>During yesterday's late-afternoon press conference there were signs of the effects of the distress so clearly evident to a worldwide television audience when she abandoned the race. At one point in the questioning she was forced to call a temporary halt to the proceedings while she composed herself. </p> <p>\"Basically I don't have a lot of explanations at this point,\" she said. \"I'm struggling myself to comprehend what happened and find a reason for it. This morning I had some tests done, and I'm still waiting for the results to come through.\" </p> <p>Of all the 271 athletes who arrived in Athens under the banner of the Great Britain team, Radcliffe seemed to many to be the best bet for a gold medal. </p> <p>But the world record holder, who is considering whether to compete in Friday's 10,000m event, confessed yesterday that there had been \"nothing left in her legs\" when an Ethiopian runner, Elfenesh Alemu, overtook her just over two hours into the marathon, with 22 and a half miles run. </p> <p>What she could say was that the conditions had not been to blame, thus confirming the belief of those who thought that mental turmoil, rather than simply a physical toll, had been responsible for her inability to finish the race. </p> <p>The temperature of 35C (95F), the 35% humidity and the relentless, shadeless hills of the 26-mile course had offered nothing unexpected to an athlete whose preparations for this event during the past 18 months had been almost obsessively single-minded. </p> <p>No athlete in the world has spent more time bringing scientific principles to bear on her diet, on her physical conditioning, and on helping her body to recover from the effects of training and competition. In recent weeks she had trained in seclusion in southern Spain, in the sort of environment she knew she would find last weekend on the road between the village of Marathon and the Panathinaiko stadium in Athens. </p> <p>\"They were tough conditions\", she said yesterday, \"but they were tough for everyone. You have to train to cope with that. I'd done that. The conditions were tough, but I didn't finish the race dehydrated or in any sort of distress from the heat. </p> <p>\"I was prepared. I'd prepared for run ning in the heat. I don't feel the heat was a factor. Where we were in Spain, it was as hot, and probably more humid. And I train on hills the whole time. So I can't say it was a lack of preparation. I'm totally devastated, because this is what it had all been about, preparing for this race. To run that badly and not really have a reason for it is hard.\" </p> <p>There had been rumours that she had been seen visiting the clinic of a German sports doctor, Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt, in recent weeks, seeking treatment for a leg injury, but she refused yesterday to advance that as a factor. </p> <p>\"I did have a slight calf niggle four and a bit weeks ago, and I visited Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt's clinic for a check-up,\" she said. \"I've been going there regularly. I missed two days' training then. And last week I had another niggle. Probably that was a stress, so close to the Olympics There was worry there. But I came through that and I was back training and it didn't bother me in the race.\" </p> <p>Other forms of pressure, she conceded, might have played a part. \"I've had pressure before. Yes, there was more pressure this time, but probably the biggest pressure was from myself. You're always going to be more nervous before the Olympics than you are before other races, but I don't think I can use that as an excuse.\" </p> <p>There were certainly no signs of unusual pressure when she took the lead at the start of the race and held it for 15 miles. The difficulties started when Mizuki Noguchi of Japan, the eventual winner, and Alemu, the Ethiopian, broke away from the leading group of 10 runners. </p> <p>\"I felt reasonably good for the first part of the race,\" Radcliffe said. \"I intended putting in some effort on the tougher parts of the hills and the long climb. I felt good on the first couple of hills. </p> <p>\"Then I had stomach problems at 15 kilometres, but I seemed to come through those, and I went through a bad stage when the two girls broke away. I seemed to feel a bit better when I got back into second place. I was trying to stay positive and feeling that the gap, at that stage, wasn't beyond me. I could pull it back if I held it together.\" </p> <p>The big problems came when the race started the long descent to the finish through the suburbs of Athens. She had become so disorientated that she found herself following the double rows of cats' eyes that marked the bus lane, rather than staying in the middle of the road. </p> <p>\"I was going downhill, but I felt like I was going uphill,\" she said. \"I was running at the side of the road, but I was still hitting those bump things. It wasn't like any part of me was hurting. But all of me was, if that makes sense. There wasn't any muscle or anything that seized up. I just couldn't keep going.\" </p> <p>Seeing Alemu go past had been the final blow. \"Emotionally, it kicks you in the guts. It did that when the two girls pulled away, too, but I'd got that back together and come through it. </p> <p>\"Physically, I knew I could do that. If I'd been running strongly when she [Alemu] came by me, I could have regrouped and got through that, too.\" </p> <p>As she stopped and looked back down the road, hands on her knees, her thoughts were divided between carrying on and finding a way of giving up. </p> <p>\"My mind didn't want to let go and give up on it,\" she said. \"There was support there, from people shouting at me to get going. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what the protocol was for just getting out of there.\" </p> <p>She tried to start again, but realised, for the first time in her life, that it was useless. \"You go through bad stages in every race, and definitely in a marathon, but not as bad as that. I've never felt before that I couldn't finish a race.\" </p> <p>Eventually, she was picked up and taken back to the stadium, where she met her husband, Gary Lough, and her parents. \"There's very little anyone can say to comfort you,\" she said. </p> <p>After a doctor had checked her over and could find nothing wrong, she was taken out of the stadium and driven back to the athletes' village. </p> <p>\"I was just in shock,\" she remembered yesterday. \"I was numb. I was almost unable to cry. I felt I'd let everyone else down. But nobody was hurting inside as much as I was.\" </p> <p>She is not counting on receiving a definitive solution to the mystery when the results of her tests come through. \"It's easier, I guess, to pick yourself up and do something about it if you know the reason,\" she said. \"But whether I'll find a reason, I don't know.\"</p> <p><b>Rocky road to the top</b> </p> <p><b>1973</b> Born December 17 in Northwich, Cheshire. </p> <p><b>1992</b> Comes to prominence by winning the world junior cross-country title in Boston, US.
