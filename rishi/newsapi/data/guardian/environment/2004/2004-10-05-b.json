  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has taken control of the per una womenswear brand, handing over \u00a3125m to its founder George Davies. </p> <p>The acquisition was announced by M&amp;S chief executive Stuart Rose in July as part of his turnaround plan for the struggling chain after he was brought in to fend off a \u00a39bn takeover attempt by billionaire Philip Green. </p> <p>The per una range - more fashionable than standard M&amp;S clothing and aimed at younger shoppers - was invented by Mr Davies in 2001. The high street fashion guru who was behind Next in the early 1980s and the \u00a31bn-selling George at Asda brand, was called in by M&amp;S's previous chief executive Roger Holmes to help stem falling sales. </p> <p>The unusual business deal thrashed out by the two men involved Mr Davies acting as a supplier but owning the brand and doing his own PR and marketing. </p> <p>The ranges quickly proved successful. Per una is understood to generate annual sales of more than \u00a3250m and account for about 15% of M&amp;S womenswear sales. </p> <p>One of Mr Rose's first moves at M&amp;S was to take action to secure the per una brand for M&amp;S. Buying the brand - which is sold in 170 of the chain's 300 outlets - ensures that it can never be withdrawn from the stores and secures all the profit generated by the label. </p> <p>\"This is a very important part of our womenswear,\" said an M&amp;S spokeswoman. \"It's very close to the season, reflecting themes and styles from the catwalk.\" </p> <p>The \u00a3125m price includes the continued services of Mr Davies, who will stay on as chief executive for at least two years. The relationship with Mr Davies is one of the few recent successes at M&amp;S, which has been bleeding market share to rivals since 1997.</p>",
  "<p>Meg Whitman of eBay has been named the most powerful woman in corporate America by Fortune magazine, toppling Carly Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard who had been at the top of the list since it began in 1998. </p> <p>Eight British-based women are listed in a separate ranking of the 50 most powerful businesswomen outside the United States, led by Marjorie Scardino of Pearson in third place. Kate Swann, the WH Smith chief executive, is 10th; Rose-Marie Bravo of Burberry is 13th; Vivienne Cox, executive vice-president at BP, is 15th; Clara Furse, head of the London Stock Exchange, is 17th and Val Gooding, chief executive of Bupa, is 18th. </p> <p>The other British women making the international list are Sly Bailey, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, at 23rd and Amelia Fawcett, vice chairman of Morgan Stanley Europe, at 40th. </p> <p>The international ranking is led by Anne Lauvergeon of the French group Areva and Xie Qihua who runs the Shanghai Baosteel group in China. Fortune ranks the women on criteria including the size and importance of a business in its marketplace, the businesswoman's clout within her organisation, her career trajectory and social or cultural impact. </p> <p>In the case of Ms Whitman, 48, there was one over-riding factor, the magazine said. \"2004 belongs to Meg Whitman. Here's just one reason: The $60bn market value of eBay, the company she runs, has surged past that of HP.\" </p> <p>The online marketplace is one of the fastest growing companies in history. This year it expects to report operating profits of about $1bn (\u00a3555m) on revenues of $3.2bn. It began as a meeting place for people selling collectibles, such as Beanie Babies, but has grown rapidly into many other marketplaces, including clothing, electronics, furniture and cars. </p> <p>The online business has become a cultural phenomenon. Some 48 million people are expected to use the site this year, buying and selling $32bn worth of goods. </p> <p>Ms Whitman joined eBay seven years ago. She had been living in Boston and was working at the toy firm Hasbro, where she was running the Mr Potato Head brand and introducing the Teletubbies to America. </p> <p>After being approached by a headhunter, she moved her family to the west coast and by September 1998 guided the business on to the stock market. </p> <p>Ms Whitman is a Harvard MBA graduate and worked at Procter &amp; Gamble and Disney before joining Hasbro.</p> <p><strong>Top five</strong></p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Meg Whitman, president and chief executive of eBay, the online marketplace </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Carly Fiorina, chairman and chief executive, Hewlett-Packard </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Andrea Jung, chairman and chief executive, Avon Products </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Anne Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive, Xerox </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Marjorie Magner, chairman and chief executive, global consumer group, Citigroup</p>",

  "The Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, received a boost in local elections on Sunday, in what was widely seen as a referendum on his first two years of government. <p>Candidates from Mr Da Silva's Workers party (PT) swept to power in six out of 26 state capitals and forced their opponents to a run-off vote in nine more, in a result which analysts say points towards a PT victory in a general election scheduled for 2006. </p> <p>\"The results are showing that the president is successfully paving the way for his re-election in 2006,\" Christopher Garman, a Sao Paulo political analyst, told the Associated Press. In Sunday's vote, the PT made inroads in the poorest northern and north-east regions, where deeply entrenched patronage networks have long allowed traditional parties to dominate, and made important new gains in the rural mid-west. </p> <p>\"This result confirms the PT's success in consolidating its agenda at the national level. The process that began with Lula's election victory is deepening and spreading around the country,\" said Carlos Eduardo Sarmento, a political analyst with the Getulio Vargas Institute in Rio de Janeiro. </p> <p>Mr Da Silva swept to power in 2002, promising to bring social and economic justice to South America's largest country. But in July, thousands of Brazilians protested at high unemployment and interest rates. </p> <p>After taking office, the former union leader surprised the global financial community - and many supporters - by giving priority to financial stability and orthodox fiscal policies. Unlike Argentina, Brazil has met all its commitments to the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>Lula's economic team dismayed many on the left who advocated more aggressive action to reduce poverty, but a recent surge in the economy has helped silence critics.</p>",
  "Yes, James Dyson and I are confused by the \"high-society mimsiness\" of Constance Spry and its suitability for the Design Museum, which I founded and James chaired, and which was set up to explore the industrial design of quantity-produced products (Dyson resigns seat at Design Museum, September 28). <p>We both understand the importance of style, but at the moment there is very little content at the museum and we want to see the balance redressed. However, Constance Spry is off the radar as far as I'm concerned.<br><b>Terence Conran</b><br>London </p> <p>I totally disagree with James Dyson's point of view. In the UK, Dyson is too often presented as the archetypal industrial/product designer. Dyson and his followers hark back to idea of the lone genius designer/inventor of the 19th century, ie Brunel et al, who creates revolutionary ideas that change the world. Design should be inclusive - not the preserve of beagle-like boffins. </p> <p>So much of the work produced by industrial design students is based on a small repertoire of products and concepts. The primary reason for this is that too much emphasis is placed on the idea of technology being the main motivator of cultural change. This, I believe, is rooted in the idea of an industrial designer's primary role being that of an inventor. </p> <p>In today's hi-tech and global market, it is nigh impossible for an industrial designer working in his or her workshop to invent revolutionary concepts that will have a profound impact on people's lives. Industrial design is more than engineering. A wide range of other cultural factors including styling, status and political beliefs shapes consumers' choices and tastes. The model of design championed by the likes of Dyson is far too insular to engage the interest of no more than a small minority.<br><b>Pollard Lucien</b><br>London </p> <p>Jonathan Glancey claims we are \"in an increasingly post-industrial era\". Oh really? At which point in history was there more manufacturing occurring than there is now? Do mobile phones, computers, motor cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices etc grow on trees? The founding fathers of the industrial revolution would marvel at the industrial processes we now have at our disposal. Design is about making things that actually work - engineering, not fashion.<br><b>Danny O'Hare</b><br>Brighton</p>",

You descend the steps of your stuccoed West London mansion all set to jump into your Range Rover and whisk little Tarquin and Tarquinetta to their independent schools. You notice something on the windscreen. It's a parking ticket, isn't it? \"How dare those council jobsworths ticket me?\" you ask yourself. </p> <p>Look closer. The ticket turns out to be a fake. It may have the authentic-looking letter-heading of a local council, but the small print reads as follows. \"Poor Vehicle Choice. See inside for how our children and grandchildren will pay for our dependence on fossil fuels.\" The simulacrum of a ticket was put there by Alliance Against 4x4s, whose members have distributed as many as 5,000 such tickets in campaigning against what they call \"Chelsea tractors\". Inspired by American activists, their message is that SUVs are not safe, not clean, and not cool. It's that last word that really hurts, isn't it? </p> <p>\"People get them as status symbols,\" says Alliance member Hayley Rolfe. \"But if you want a status symbol, buy a handbag.\" Or a penis enlarger? \"Perhaps.\" </p> <p>The Alliance Against 4x4s consisted of \"about six people sitting around wondering what we could put on the website. Then one of us had this idea to shame SUV drivers with phoney parking tickets.\" Website manager Sian Berry designed them and, along with others, tours likely London districts with the tickets - a task that would surely expose them to all kinds of braying-related incidents. Only once, in Hampstead, did Berry get a mouthful from two men, who threw the crumpled ticket at her. Could they not have recycled it instead? </p> <p>\"Four-wheel drives should pay a \u00a320 congestion charge instead of \u00a35, until they can be taxed out of existence, which is our ultimate aim,\" says Rolfe. The alliance hopes to expand the ticketing operation around the country, but they are short of funds. </p> <p>The original print run of tickets failed to keep pace with demand from people who want to join the alliance. Nor does it keep up with the number of SUVs in the capital: the Society for Motor Manufacturers reckons that more than 100,000 4x4s are registered to London addresses. Sales in the capital in the first half of 2004 were 12% greater than the same period last year.

Across a field worked by farmers with simple hand tools rises the modern steel-framed building of the Taedonggang Brewery - which used to be the Ushers Brewery of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, maker of award-winning real ales, until it was bought and shipped lock, stock and - well - barrel to the world's most secretive state. </p> <p>\"Our people like the beer a lot,\" says Ri Hae Nam, the brewery's assistant chief engineer, fiddling with the zip of his dark jumpsuit, the type so favoured by Kim Jong Il. The Dear Leader, who is also rumoured to like a tipple, visited the brewery shortly after it opened and gave a little on-the-spot guidance. \"He told us to work to achieve greater quality,\" recalls Ri. \"We produce our beer mindful of the love of Kim Jong Il.\" </p> <p>The story begins with Kim, who, in 2000, decided he wanted a world-class brewery and, through a German agent, answered an advertisement for the Ushers brewery. \"When they first approached us I assumed it must be the South Koreans,\" recalls Peter Ward, who helped seal the deal. \"I was a bit shocked when I heard they were from the North.\" Once he had got over the surprise, Ward had two practical concerns. The first was money: how would the impoverished North pay? The second was security: the technology for fermenting yeast bears more than a passing resemblance to that for fermenting germs. </p> <p>Once Ward was satisfied that Pyongyang wanted beer, not bugs, the deal was closed, and in late 2000 a team of 12 North Koreans arrived in Trowbridge. They were to spend the next five months there, living just outside town, close to a supermarket with a reassuringly stable supply of rice. </p> <p>Soon the entire place - milling machines, brewhouse, fermenting vessels, yeast handling plant - was on its way to Pyongyang. Says Ward: \"They literally hacked the place to pieces.\" </p> <p>In April 2002, the brewery was successfully started up again, producing green three-quarter-litre bottles sporting a picture of the Taedong river, which runs through the capital. Of course, says Ri, it was all \"thanks to the leadership of Kim Jong Il\". </p> <p>The brewery's development has been accompanied by what Pyongyang calls adjustments, economic changes that have brought big hikes in prices and wages, but also brought farmers' markets, kiosks and stalls to the streets, providing the first signs of commercial life in years. </p> <p>Restaurants have sprung up too - not private, insist the Koreans, but with private investment - usually Korean-Japanese. Most are quite keen on Taedonggang beer.

When I met him, in 1993, he seemed easily the most youthful 70-year-old I had ever encountered. What's more, the master photographer was still taking pictures of his father, who was in his 90s. I expected Avedon to go on for ever. And I hoped he would. </p> <p>My personal snapshot of Richard Avedon dates from when I was working as a glorified London gofer for the New Yorker. In a controversial move, the editor, Tina Brown, had recently appointed Avedon as the first photographer in the history of the famously photo-free magazine. </p> <p>Green as I was, I knew that Avedon was a legend. This, after all, was the photographer on whom Fred Astaire's character in Funny Face was based, with Audrey Hepburn his reluctant muse torn between the spheres of art and commerce. Avedon's genius was to straddle both worlds effortlessly. </p> <p>There was professionalism, but no mystique. He worked quickly, with very little fuss. His secret, perhaps, was his charm - a natural ability to put his sitters at ease. During our shoot, he even persuaded Tilda Swinton, an actress serious to the point of asceticism, to take her top off. </p> <p>One afternoon a writer and I were visiting Avedon's studio-home on East 75th Street in Manhattan. Excited about getting the proofs of his career retrospective, An Autobiography, he took us through each page, recalling the shoot and his subjects. It felt like a private masterclass with one of the greats of 20th-century photography. </p> <p>At one point he paused on a spread that comprised, on the left, a photo of the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and his boyfriend, Peter Orlovsky, both very bearded and very naked; on the right, a grim-faced Henry Kissinger. This juxtaposition, he explained, was the result of a dinner in Washington where Kissinger had made a gratuitous and disparaging remark about \"faggots\". Placing him next to Ginsberg was Avedon's sweet little revenge. </p> <p>But behind this piece of mischief, I see now, was something deeper and kinder - the merest hint that these two adversaries had more in common than they knew. For that's what Avedon was: a true humanist.

It sublimates the raw into the refined, requires no set-up or equipment other than the functioning hands of two players, needs minimal communication and can be played in any location. But, before one can answer the question of how to play RPS, it is important to ask why we play RPS. </p> <p>The core idea is that RPS is by definition a decision-making vehicle rather than a game simply enjoyed for sport. </p> <p>Many opponents to the RPS system ask, \"Wouldn't it just be simpler to toss a coin?\" On the surface it may appear so, but even a cursory look at coin-tossing show us otherwise. </p> <p>Consider the following example: </p> <p>Benji: Let's toss a coin for it. </p> <p>Owen: OK. I don't have any money though. </p> <p>Benji: (digs through pockets) Found one! </p> <p>Owen: I want to throw it.

It had already hit the ground. You have to call it in the air! </p> <p>Owen: Uh oh, the coin just rolled under the couch. Do you have another one? </p> <p>Contrast that with the following: </p> <p>Benji: Let's RPS for it </p> <p>Owen: OK, one, two, three.

Margaret Thatcher understood that. Tony Blair understands that. We understand it too.\"</p> <p>However, just an hour earlier at a Daily Telegraph fringe meeting, the party chairman, Liam Fox, a standard bearer for the Thatcherite wing, expressed his delight at the return to a more true-blue agenda.</p> <p>He said: \"We've shied away from making the case for lower taxes for too long. That's why I'm so happy this week to hear it.\"</p> <p>He also dismissed any calls for a move to the centre to tackle the threat from the Liberal Democrats, saying: \"They operate best in an ideological vacuum. 1979 wiped them out. The way to beat them is for us to know what we stand for.\"</p> <p>Dr Fox also claimed it was \"only in recent months the party has regained its hunger. The biggest change in the last year [since Michael Howard became leader] is the party has become leadable again. We were unleadable since the first day of the 1992 government.\"</p> <p>He also revealed that according to internal Tory party polling, Iraq only came 12th on a list of voters' concerns.</p> <p>Reacting to today's news that Paul Sykes, one of Ukip's major financial backers, had returned to the Tories, the party chairman said: \"We've seen Ukip in their true colours.

It was bad enough when Kerry was deferring to the French. Now he's saying that we have to get the green light from space aliens.\"</p> <p>Joshua Micah Marshall, more of a Kerry supporter, does not underestimate the power of the attacks. His analysis of six post- debate polls on his <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_03.php#003570\">Talking Points Memo</a> puts Mr Bush and Mr Kerry neck and neck \u2013 meaning the Democrats got a bounce and the Republicans are in a sub-50% danger zone \u2013 but warns the senator is still vulnerable. \"Beating back the Bush campaign's 'Kerry Doctrine' lies is imperative,\" he writes. </p> <p>Andrew Sullivan's <a href=\" http://andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_10_03_dish_archive.html#109694909728674453\"> Daily Dish</a>, meanwhile, sees the president as more at risk. Mr Bush's 47% approval rating is as about \"as low as it can possibly get\" if he is to have a hope of re-election, he says. He also claims to have found a New York Times/CBS poll in which 59% cite poor planning for Iraq by the president as a source of weakness for him.</p> <p>The Bush-supporting blogs will invariably search out new battlegrounds to fight on, though one that failed to work is now being voluntarily surrendered: after posting video stills from the debate footage and many hundreds of words, <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=12988_Penmanship\">Little Green Footballs</a> has finally called time on its forensic analysis of whether or not Mr Kerry brought his own pen to the debate. \"It's a bit depressing that this country is now willing to accept blatant flouting of debate rules because it was 'only a pen',\" laments Charles Johnson. Remember, bloggers do like to pore over the details.</p>",
  "When John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate, he said he was looking forward to see him going \"toe to toe\" with Dick Cheney. Tonight, that wish is granted as the two men take part in the vice-presidential debate. <p>With the exception of George Bush Sr's running mate, Dan Quayle, being told that he was \"no John Kennedy\", vice-presidential debates have traditionally produced few notable moments. But that does not mean they are inconsequential.</p> <p>Tonight's comes at a crucial time in the campaign, with Mr Kerry appearing to have recovered some of the momentum he lost over the summer. The Republicans will be fighting back after a presidential debate that George Bush was widely perceived to have lost.</p> <p>Mr Edwards will attempt to keep the focus on what the Democrats argue are Mr Bush's mistakes in Iraq, while Mr Cheney will concentrate on portraying Mr Kerry as a potentially weak commander-in-chief. </p> <p>He has done something similar before, creating outrage in the Democratic camp when he said the danger of a Kerry presidency was that \"we'll get hit again\".</p> <p>The two men, meeting in Ohio tonight, are very different. Mr Cheney is a former defence secretary who has been in Washington since the 60s. Enormously experienced, he is the most heavyweight conservative in Mr Bush's team. </p> <p>Mr Edwards has been in Washington politics for six years. Where Mr Cheney has the reputation of being a bruiser, he is known as a charmer. To his supporters, Mr Cheney exudes a calm, man of the world authority while, in Mr Edwards' youthful looks and ready smile, the Democrats see the glimmer of a future Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Republicans are somewhat dismissive of his appeal, attempting to pin it down to his thick hair. Mr Bush told a rally in Missouri that while Mr Cheney, who is balding, \"doesn't have the waviest hair in the race, I didn't pick him for his hairdo. I picked him because he has good judgment, great experience, and he can get the job done\". </p> <p>However, Mr Edwards rattles them, despite the near consensual agreement that he underperformed on the summer campaign trail. </p> <p>He won his senate seat in normally Republican North Carolina, and polling in the primaries showed he had an appeal to both Republican and independent voters. He is also an impressive speaker - a man who, as a trial lawyer, made his fortune by convincing jurors to see his side of a case.</p> <p>The pre-debate negotiations have confined the two debaters to a desk. Mr Edwards will, therefore, be prevented from striding around in the manner of a lawyer, while Mr Cheney - as used to boardrooms as he is to the White House, will look authoritative in what is almost his natural environment.</p> <p>One word you can expect to hear a lot is Haliburton - the company has a strong link to each man's past. Mr Edwards is thought to be less comfy around foreign policy than domestic matters but, when he was a trial lawyer, made his fortune out of corporate negligence cases. </p> <p>Mr Cheney is the former chairman of Halliburton, a company accused of waste and overcharging as a US army contractor in Iraq. To the Iraq war's opponents, it symbolises a White House that is too close to its favourite corporations.</p> <p>Mr Edwards may not be able to debate the role of permanent alliances as well as Mr Kerry, but he knows how to put a company on trial. </p> <p>And his opposite number is capable of springing surprises: his debate with Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in 2000 had been expected to be bruising, but he played it nice, neutralising much of his opponent's preparation. </p> <p>If he does it again, Mr Kerry may fail to see his \"toe to toe\" wish fulfilled.</p>",
  "<p>A judge in Milan today ruled that two former auditors of Parmalat should stand trial over the \u20ac14bn collapse of the Italian dairy giant.</p> <p>Preliminary hearings began today to determine whether 32 individuals and companies associated with the events that led to Parmalat's insolvency ten months ago should be tried.</p> <p>Judge Cesare Tacconi quickly ruled that auditors Lorenzo Penca and Maurizio Bianchi should face trial in January for market rigging, according to their lawyer. Both the accused, who worked at Grant Thornton's former Italian affiliate, had asked to proceed directly to trial and forgo the potentially drawn out preliminary hearings, which are expected to last months. </p> <p>Others amongst the accused were expected to request immediate trials, while some might seek to plea bargain, lawyers said. Allegations listed on the indictment include market rigging, providing false information to auditors and blocking the work of the Italian stock market regulator Consob.</p> <p>Prosecutors were still arguing that trials should be ordered for the other 27 individuals and the companies involved. Among the individuals are Parmalat's founder and chief executive, Calisto Tanzi, and former financial officers. The companies that may find themselves in the dock are Mr Penca and Mr Bianchi's employer, Grant Thornton SpA (now Italaudit SpA), as well as the Italian offices of Bank of America and Deloitte &amp; Touche, Parmalat's primary auditor.</p> <p>Prosecutors say an inner circle of Parmalat directors, helped by three ex-Bank of America staff and outside auditors, hid the company's true finances until it collapsed under \u20ac14bn (\u00a39.7bn) of debt last December. The level of debt was eight times higher than accounts had claimed.</p> <p>Dozens of investors also attended Milan's main court to register as civil plaintiffs in the fraud case. One, a retired Milanese woman, said: \"Those bonds were a safe investment - at least that's what they told us. We all thought it was a solid company.\" A protestor carrying an Italian flag with \"The Shame of Italy\" written across it was barred from the courtroom.</p> <p>Mr Tanzi chose not to attend court. He was released from house arrest last week, having spent months under arrest in prison, at home or in hospitals being treated for a chronic heart condition. As well as potentially huge damages, he and former executives who helped him turn the company into one of Italy's biggest multinationals, could face years in jail.</p> <p>Both Mr Penca and Mr Bianchi were arrested on December 31, accused of having falsely certified Parmalat's balance sheets and of having suggested the \"fictitious operations\" needed to carry out the company's fraud. </p> <p>Parmalat, which has been under emergency management since December, registered itself as a civil plaintiff in the case against the individuals. However, according to company lawyer Marco de Luca, it decided not to proceed against the three financial institutions \"for strategic reasons\". </p> <p>Bank of America today protested its innocence. \"We are confident that this procedure will result in a finding that the facts do not support the administrative charge against Bank of America,\" it said in a statement. </p> <p>Enrico Bondi, Parmalat's government-appointed administrator has already launched a second line of attack, filing suits in the US for $10bn (\u00a35.6bn) of damages from Citigroup and the auditors Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton. </p> <p>Smaller sums are being sought from other banks that worked for Parmalat - including UBS, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston - as administrators try to raise money for what remains of the once global milk and food business. </p> <p>More banks could yet be put on trial in Milan, where prosecutors are investigating whether they misled investors in selling Parmalat bonds.</p>",
  "The return of Eurosceptic millionaire Paul Sykes to the Tory fold has brought relief to the party, which fears being squeezed by the UK Independence party at the general election, but also unease about a possible move to the right. <p>The Yorkshire businessman, who contributed over half of Ukip's \u00a32m fighting fund for June's European elections, said that the party had \"blown it\" by deciding to field candidates against Eurosceptic Tory MPs.</p> <p>Mr Sykes' announcement was followed by a resolutely Eurosceptic speech by the Tory leader, Michael Howard, who appealed to Ukip voters to back the Conservatives' bid to \"bring power back from Brussels\".</p> <p>Despite Conservative briefings yesterday that Europe would not play a major part in Mr Howard's speech, it was central to his message of restoring accountability and trust to British politics.</p> <p><b>Deal accusations</b></p> <p>Labour meanwhile reacted to the news by accusing the Tories of striking a deal with Mr Sykes, who is known to have met with the party's deregulation spokesman and die-hard Eurosceptic, John Redwood.</p> <p>Cabinet Office minister Ruth Kelly said: \"this secret deal with the rightwing funder of Ukip shows that the Conservative party has not changed. </p> <p>\"They are still the same old Conservative party, still out of touch with the British people and still unable to reach out to voters in the centre ground.\" </p> <p>David Cameron, the Conservatives' policy chief, denied that a deal had been struck, telling Sky News that \"we are not going to do any deals with anybody\". </p> <p>\"What matters is doing the right thing for the country and taking back some of the powers from Brussels to make sure we have proper, good accountable government in Westminster,\" he added. </p> <p><b>Abandoning Ukip</b></p> <p>Speaking on the BBC Today programme this morning Mr Sykes said that it was it was the choice between Labour and the \"only one major party now that is anti-Brussels, that is for repatriating powers\" had had prompted his decision.</p> <p>Mr Sykes added that he was \"warming\" to what he was hearing from the Conservative party, adding: \"I have no intention whatsoever of upsetting their applecart.\"</p> <p>He later met with the former talkshow host and Ukip MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk, who announced the party's intention to \"kill\" the Tories as a political force at the weekend.</p> <p>Former Tory leader William Hague was not convinced, however, by Mr Sykes' promise of good behaviour, cautioning against a hardening of the party's position on Europe in an attempt to woo back Ukip supporters who once voted Conservative.</p> <p>\"I think the thing to do is not to buy off people who are thinking of voting for Ukip by a change in policy,\" he told the programme.</p> <p><b>Tory dilemma</b></p> <p>The Conservatives have been agonising about how to see off Ukip, which threatens to take Tory votes in the party's most marginal constituencies, without alienating centrist floating voters.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, warned at a conference fringe meeting yesterday that Ukip could lose the party between 30 and 50 seats at the general election unless it is stopped.</p> <p>\"We must get the country to buy its conservatism from the Conservatives,\" he said, suggesting that the Tories should concentrate on traditional rightwing issues such as crime and immigration.</p> <p>Mr Redwood, who has been key to Tory efforts to win over Mr Sykes, identified Europe \"above all\" as an election issue at a fringe meeting.</p> <p>However, his cabinet colleague Mr Cameron dismissed his call and insisted that the Tories needed to concentrate on issues preoccupying people \"in pubs and clubs\" and not \"wild forays into different areas\".</p> <p><b>Ukip disunity</b></p> <p>Mr Sykes' withdrawal of support from Ukip follows its conference vote to contest all parliamentary constituencies at the general election, and Mr Kilroy-Silk's appeal for the party to \"kill\" the Tories.</p> <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip's group of MEPs, today suggested that election decision may have been a misjudgment.</p> <p> \"The party went to its conference on Saturday in Bristol in euphoric mood. I think that amidst that euphoria we rather lost sight of our key objective,\" he told the Today programme.</p> <p> \"In my opinion we should not be fighting against sitting Tory and Labour MPs who are prepared to say the right things.\"</p> <p>The move to stand candidates in every seat was strongly supported by Mr Kilroy-Silk, the party's most prominent figure who went on to declare his ambition to replace its leader, Roger Knapman.</p> <p>However, Mr Farage said that the former daytime TV presenter would not succeed in his bid to take over the party and that Mr Knapman's position was safe.</p> <p> \"I am afraid that he is going to be disappointed there because there is no appetite within the party at all for any form of internecine warfare, so that isn't going to happen,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Kodak today announced 600 UK job losses and the closure of a Nottingham factory as the world's largest photography company continued to shift its focus towards digital cameras.</p> <p>The group is to shut down its photographic film finishing plant at Annesley, near Nottingham, with the loss of 350 jobs. It will also end some operations in Harrow, Middlesex, reducing the 1,350-strong workforce there by 250. </p> <p>However, 300 employees will move to Harrow from Kodak House, the company's UK headquarters in nearby Hemel Hempstead. The Harrow site will then become Kodak's British HQ.</p> <p>In January Kodak said it would drastically scale back the production and sale of traditional 35mm cameras and reduce \"global facilities\" by a third over three years in order to concentrate on digital photography. The company said that today \"sees the details announced of how this will affect Kodak's UK operations\".</p> <p>Peter Blackwell, the UK managing director, said: \"These have been difficult decisions to take and are no reflection on the highly valued work performed by our employees. Sadly, Kodak has to respond to customer and consumer trends changing so dramatically.</p> <p>\"The simple fact is that ... demand for traditional products such as film and paper has fallen with the rising popularity of digital photography.\"</p> <p>Some 15,000 job cuts worldwide have been expected since Kodak made its announcement in January. Over the previous five years it had cut 22,000 jobs, reducing the total workforce from 86,000 to 64,000 at the end of last year. Around 2,700 of those workers were employed in Britain.</p> <p>Kodak's chief executive, Daniel Carp, said in January the cuts were intended to save up to $1bn (\u00a3560m) a year by 2007. \"Obviously, when you have to lay off as many people as we have, that's gut-wrenching, but we know we are doing it for the better good of the whole company,\" he said.</p> <p>Kodak was dumped out of the Dow Jones index at the beginning of April for the first time in 64 years as it became increasingly anomalous as a barometer for the rest of corporate America.</p> <p>A spokesman said today Kodak's priority was to ensure all employees were well looked after. Workers at Annesley, where the factory is due to shut at the end of September 2005, would receive a year's notice, he said. They would also receive a \"highly competitive severance package\".</p> <p>The Harrow workers would lose their jobs at the end of March and would also receive a severance package. The spokesman added that Kodak would look at the possibility of voluntary redundancies.</p>",
  "<p>Oxford's new vice-chancellor, John Hood, today took over as the first outsider to head the 900-year-old university. </p> <p>The ceremony was held in the university church as the grand Sheldonian theatre was closed for \u00a31m worth of repairs.</p> <p>The New Zealander, who headed the University of Auckland after a successful business career, had earlier told a gathering at the House of Commons that increasing the university's revenues from spin-off companies and fundraising appeals was vital if it was to fulfil its mission.</p> <p>He also defended Oxford's student admissions procedures which have been under fire from the government since the case of Laura Spence, a pupil from a north east comprehensive who was turned down and went to Harvard instead. </p> <p>Tutors were having to make incredibly subjective judgements about marginal candidates and the procedures could not be so \"robotically formulaic\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Hood said: \"The competition - national and international - for the very best scholars, whether staff or students, is intense.

  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer today said it had bought the women's clothing brand Per Una from its creator George Davies in a \u00a3125m deal.</p> <p>The company had initially announced plans to buy the label in July, when the chief executive, Stuart Rose, unveiled his ultimately successful plan to head off a takeover bid from the retail billionaire Philip Green.</p> <p>Per Una was formed as a joint venture between M&amp;S and the former Next boss Mr Davies in 2001, and has been one of the few bright spots in a gloomy few years for the struggling retailer. </p> <p>M&amp;S said it had bought \"the company, the brand and people\", although Mr Davies will remain as its chief executive for \"at least two years\", and \"will continue to be responsible for the business\". </p> <p>Mr Davies - who was also the brains behind Asda's George fashion brand - previously had a supplier relationship with M&amp;S, but the retailer will now receive all revenues.</p> <p>Per Una was seen as a way of attracting younger shoppers to M&amp;S stores.

  "<p>Arsenal today unveiled a \u00a3100m sponsorship deal with Emirates just days after Chelsea claimed it had chosen not to extend its contract with the Arab airline. </p> <p>Under the deal, Emirates will get shirt sponsorship and have the club's brand new ground named after it until at least 2021. </p> <p>The club's new stadium in Finsbury Park in north London, scheduled to be ready by the time the 2006/07 season kicks off, will be known as the Emirates Stadium for its first 15 years.</p> <p>Under the terms of the record-breaking deal, which is likely to be worth at least \u00a3100m to the club over the length of the contract, Emirates will take over as shirt sponsors once the north London club's existing deal runs out at the end of the 2005/06 season. </p> <p>\"The combined value of both elements of the sponsorship is by far the biggest deal ever undertaken in English football,\" the club said in a statement. </p> <p>The Arsenal contract was signed at Highbury by club chairman Peter Hill-Wood and Maurice Flanagan, the Emirates vice president and group president. </p> <p>\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sponsor such a major new stadium and club, and represents a win-win partnership for both Emirates and Arsenal,\" said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, the billionaire chairman of Emirates. </p> <p>The airline currently sponsors Arsenal's Premiership rival Chelsea, which announced last week it was dropping the company at the end of this season in order to concentrate on securing a brand that better fitted with its global ambitions. </p> <p>However, that move now looks like a case of the west London club getting its PR retaliation in first, having been informed by the airline of its intention to sign a major deal with its rivals. </p> <p>But it remains to be seen whether fans of the north London club can be persuaded to refer to the ground, currently known as Ashburton Grove, as the Emirates Stadium. </p> <p>The concept of a sponsor being given naming rights to a stadium is fairly new to the UK but has been common practice in the US for some time, with companies paying up to \u00a39m a year to have baseball and American football stadiums named after them. </p> <p>Arsenal director Keith Edelman said earlier this year the club would be interested in finding a partner to sponsor the name of the ground if they offered a suitably high sum. </p> <p>\"It obviously depends on the level of sponsorship that someone comes up and offers us,\" said Mr Edelman. \"But it is also linked to whether we feel the sponsor is appropriate to be associated with the club. </p> <p>\"No one in the UK has ever got substantial amounts; maybe less than \u00a31m or possibly \u00a3200,000 a year. But it all depends on the level of interest that you get.\" </p> <p><strong>First stadium sponsor was frozen chips firm</strong><br></p> <p>Improbably, the first ground in the UK to be named after its sponsor was Scarborough's stadium, which was named after the frozen chips company McCain's, while Bolton Wanderers' new ground was christened the Reebok Stadium when it opened its gates in 1997. </p> <p>Wigan's JJB Stadium houses the city's football club and rugby league team, and is named after the sports retail chain.</p> <p>Arsenal secured the \u00a3357m needed to build the 60,000-seater stadium back in February, and the increased capacity of the ground is seen as vital in boosting revenues to the levels required to compete financially with Manchester United and Chelsea. </p> <p>The club said today the revenues from the Emirates deal, which are weighted towards the earlier years of the contract, would give it the financial muscle to meet loan repayments on the new ground as well as compete in the transfer market. </p> <p>Today's announcement could undermine Arsenal's current \u00a36m a year shirt deal with mobile phone network O2, which only recently renewed its sponsorship for another two years. </p> <p>But the club said today it remained committed to working with O2 and that the end of next season, the last at current home Highbury, would provide a natural punctuation mark. </p> <p>Its added that its Arsenal Mobile joint venture, which provides fans with news, updates, video and pictures, was likely to continue beyond the end of the current deal. </p> <p>Emirates has sponsored Chelsea for the last three years but the club announced last week it would terminate the contract at the end of this season.</p> <p>The club has already begun the search for a new shirt sponsor, with mobile phone group Orange among the favourites despite denying last week it had already begun talks. </p> <p>Other mobile phone brands sponsor top football clubs, with Vodafone paying Manchester United \u00a39m a season for its logo to appear on the club shirts. </p> <p>Another likely partner is a big financial institution. Spanish bank Banco Santander, currently in the middle of an \u00a38.6bn takeover of Abbey, is believed to be looking for sponsorship opportunities in the UK. Juan Inciarte, the Santander banker leading the Abbey bid, last week attended Chelsea's Champions League match with Porto. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Arsenal's new stadium will be named after the current sponsors of one of its biggest rivals after the football club agreed a \u00a33m a year deal with Emirates Airlines.</p> <p>By the time the champions' new ground in Finsbury Park opens its doors at the beginning of the 2006-07 season, Emirates' shirt sponsorship deal with Chelsea will have come to an end. </p> <p>But it remains to be seen whether fans of the north London club can be persuaded to refer to the ground, currently known as Ashburton Grove, as the Emirates Stadium. </p> <p>The concept of a sponsor being given naming rights to a stadium is fairly new to the UK but has been common practice in the US for some time, with companies paying up to \u00a38m or \u00a39m a year to have baseball and American football stadiums named after them. </p> <p>The Arsenal deal, believed to be worth around \u00a33m a year, is due to be announced at a press conference later today. Director Keith Edelman said earlier this year that the club would be interested in finding a partner to sponsor the name of the ground if they offered a suitably high sum. </p> <p>\"It obviously depends on the level of sponsorship that someone comes up and offers us,\" said Mr Edelman. \"But it is also linked to whether we feel the sponsor is appropriate to be associated with the club.</p> <p>\"No one in the UK has ever got substantial amounts; maybe less than \u00a31m or possibly \u00a3200,000 a year. But it all depends on the level of interest that you get.\"</p> <p>Improbably, the first ground in the UK to be named after its sponsor was Scarborough's stadium, which was named after the frozen chips company McCains, while Bolton Wanderers' new ground was christened the Reebok Stadium when it opened its gates in 1997. Wigan's JJB Stadium houses the city's football club and rugby league team, and is named after the sports retail chain.</p> <p>Arsenal's new 60,000-seater stadium is scheduled to be ready for the beginning of the 2006-07 season. The club finally secured the \u00a3357m needed to build the stadium back in February, and the increased capacity of the ground is seen as vital in boosting revenues to the levels required to compete financially with Premiership rivals Manchester United and Chelsea. </p> <p>Emirates has sponsored Chelsea for the last three years but the club announced last week it would terminate the contract at the end of this season to look for a brand that would better fit its global aspirations. </p> <p>The west London club has begun the search for a new shirt sponsor, with mobile phone group Orange among the favourites despite denying last week it had already begun talks. </p> <p>Other mobile phone brands sponsor top football clubs. Vodafone pays Manchester United \u00a39m a season for its logo to appear on the club shirts, while last month 02 extended its sponsorship of Arsenal in a two-year, \u00a36m deal.</p> <p>Another likely partner is a big financial institution. Spanish bank Banco Santander, currently in the middle of an \u00a38.6bn takeover of Abbey, is believed to be looking for sponsorship opportunities in the UK. Juan Inciarte, the Santander banker leading the Abbey bid, last week attended Chelsea's Champions League match with Porto. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Letting myself in with borrowed keys, I feel like the home help, or the health visitor come to call on Die Familie Schneider, Gregor Schneider's installation - if that is quite the word - in two adjacent terraced houses in London's Whitechapel. Or perhaps I live here too, but have somehow forgotten. </p> <p>Ignoring me, the woman at the kitchen sink is taking an interminable time over a grubby plate. Perhaps we've had a row. I might as well be invisible. More likely I am dead, but don't know it yet, like Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Maybe I got run over or mugged and fatally stabbed on my way round here from the nearby Artangel office where I had picked up the keys, but have yet to catch up with the fact. </p> <p>Flippancy, however, won't do, even as a defence against the cumulative unhinging effect of Schneider's project, which opened last Saturday. Visitors must have an appointment; they are allotted 20 minutes each to make an unnerving visit to these two identical, unbearably normal side-by-side houses. On their return, these same visitors are shaken, upset, in need of consolation. </p> <p>So it is that one wanders around numbers 14 and 16 of this ordinary London street, first one house, then the other. I open the fridge (processed cheese triangles, bottled gherkins), rattle through the bead curtain into the living room and plonk myself on the anaemic brown sofa. The houses are the same, down to the smallest details. The same number of cigarette ends in the living-room ashtray, the same jar of Vaseline and the same slimming pills in the bathroom cabinet. The same spot wiped clean on the wall at the turn of the stairs, the same cloying, unhealthy smells and viscous puddles in the basement. But they are not exactly identical, as we shall discover. </p> <p>Gregor Schneider has called himself a painter, for want of anything better to say. Images, however, are singularly absent from the family setup in Whitechapel. Where are the framed photographs of loved ones, keepsakes, kids' pictures and scribbles? For there is a child here, somewhere or other. I heard a baby crying, inconsolable and far away, when I went down to the basement - unless it was just the wind howling in the flue. There is another room down there, with unopened packs of kitchen towels, biscuits, lollipops, stacked like gifts or as if for a game. I've seen the safety gate at the top of the stairs, the baby's changing mat in the bedroom. And the terrifying sexual graffiti, spied through the keyhole, in the attic of number 14. </p> <p>Why is there a landscape turned to the wall against the living room wainscot? And nail holes, and nails without pictures in the hall corridor wall? It is as though pictures are prohibited here. But the house - renovated, refurbished, restored and distressed to an exact pitch of wear and use and unwholesomeness - is, it turns out, full of forbidden images. In fact, the entire house is an image, a duplicated, living image of itself and its occupants, whose stairs we tramp, whose thresholds we cross or recoil from, whose basements we crawl about in - not once, but twice. </p> <p>The experience is more than one of deja vu, in Schneider's case, because some things are palpably different. One's entire field of expectation is also different as one enters the second house. Everything is the same. Nothing is the same. Perhaps because we live everything at least twice: once in the moment of the experience, and then, repeatedly, in memory. We are always revisiting the past and changing it. Schneider does the same. I have visited both houses on two different occasions. The more you know, the worse it gets. </p> <p>It is difficult not to project a narrative here as you go up and down the stairs, step into the malodorous and malevolent bedroom, this cloying bower of nasty textures, grim wallpaper, gilded fittings and a mirrored fitted wardrobe. Who is the boy in the corner, sitting between the bed and the wall, the bin bag that covers his head rustling as he breathes? The first time, I nudge his foot to see if he's real. Is this sculpture or some horrible punishment, or a juvenile sex experiment about to go wrong? </p> <p>Water's running in the bathroom; standing in the bath is a naked man, blurry and pallid behind the transparent shower curtain. Turned away and leaning over himself, he is masturbating vigorously, breathing hard. In this vertiginous moment, it is somehow easier to think that this is a picture rather than a shocking reality. I think suddenly of Francis Bacon. Some stories are easier to tell, while there are others so unconscionable that one's imagination swerves away from them, so as to defend one against them. I shall never have a hand-job in the bath again. Or quite possibly anywhere else, come to that. </p> <p>Inevitably, given Schneider's use of live actors - the boys in the bedroom are small adults, the men and women twins - there is a sense of theatricality, and of staging, here. Whatever is being said is brought to life in the squeak of a dishcloth on a wet plate, a cough in a distant room, the tink of cutlery, the pained groans of a man masturbating. As if the setting itself weren't enough - the dour brown-and-cream paintwork, the soulless emptiness, the meagre pleasurelessness of it all. </p> <p>There's nothing here to alleviate the stultifying air of boredom and implied violence, save a copy of the Sun and a telly guide. Aren't the details so far all a bit obvious, as signifiers of a class, of low expectations? But what of these books on a side table: Three Puritan Plays, by George Bernard Shaw; To Kill a Mockingbird; Lord of the Flies; Twelfth Night. Why the Shakespeare? Is this a clue? Perhaps we are all wise fools here, like Feste in the play. The trouble is, Die Familie Schneider know more than we do; they know things we don't ever want to know. In the basement of number 16, a cot mattress is carefully laid in the coal hole. </p> <p>It is difficult to treat this work as illusion, even a theatrical illusion. Existing on an equal level with reality, it becomes a reality in itself. I have to keep reminding myself that that this is an artwork, as much as I also try to convince myself that I am not a ghost walking invisibly through a living tragedy. The desire to be invisible, to float unseen through the intimacies of other people's lives, is an almost universal fantasy. It is, after all, what most novelists do, except they mostly do it in their heads. But what child or adolescent has not rummaged in the secret world of adults, looking to uncover some secret, some knowledge or other? Adults do the same, in the name of policing their children's lives. Some never get over it. </p> <p>Schneider has spent much of his adult life building and rebuilding the house he grew up in, in the town of Rheydt, near M\u00f6nchengladbach, ever since his parents moved out in his teens. It may be significant that Rheydt is traditionally Protestant in an otherwise largely Catholic area. In what he has renamed the Totes Haus Ur, or Dead House, he has constructed a labyrinth of insulated, soundproofed rooms - rooms for every imaginable and unimaginable purpose. Dead rooms for a living death, with walls built in front of walls, pointless corridors, blind windows, rotating rooms and rooms from which, if you are accidentally locked in, there is no escape. He has at various times demolished, transported and reconstructed portions of this frightening dwelling in galleries and museums around the world. It appears not so much a project as a life. And perhaps Die Familie Schneider is a kind of parodic self-portrait or autobiography. </p> <p>Part of my own reaction to this work is the sense it gives me that I am walking through a passage in my own past life. The leaden atmosphere is familiar to me, having spent part of my own childhood in surroundings almost as lustreless, and in an atmosphere that also had a timbre of extreme sadness, repressed feelings, secrets, the unspoken. </p> <p>Die Familie Schneider is perhaps at times a bit over-egged, but shocking nonetheless. You can't avoid yourself in here. There are other kinds of families whose lives might seem brighter, or better off, or less obviously damaged than the Schneiders', but whose stories, like some dreadful trauma, are endlessly replayed without resolution or consolation. This is an unbearable, unforgettable work.</p>",
  "<p>Is Nintendo's dominance of the handheld gaming market about to come to an end? Will Sony's much-touted <a href=\"http://www.us.playstation.com/pressreleases.aspx?id=207\">PSP</a> console squish the idiosyncratic <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/ds/index.jsp\">Nintendo DS</a>? The Guardian's business section examines this very issue today - check the story out right <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1319691,00.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>I think there's room in the market for both, but in terms of predicting the biggest seller, this fight is going to come down to five main issues:</p> <p><strong>Playability</strong> Both machines offer impressive tech specs, but technology is nothing without the games to showcase it, and as you'd expect, both Sony and Nintendo are bringing some strong licenses into the ring. PSP will see the likes of Metal Gear Acid, Gran Turismo Mobile and WipeOut Pure. DS gets Mario 64x4, Metroid Prime Hunters and Animal Crossing. Okay, so Sony's is the more instantly recognisable line-up, but the question is, how easily will these brands make the transition to a handheld environment? Nintendo has considerable experience in shrinking its major franchises to mobile proportions. Sony doesn't. But then Sony had no real experience in videogame hardware before launching PlayStation and promptly battering Sega's Saturn to death.</p> <p><strong>Connectivity</strong> Both consoles feature 802.11b compatibility allowing wireless multiplayer gaming - although the DS also boasts a, 'proprietary communication protocol, which provides low battery consumption'. To counter, PSP adds Memory Stick support (perhaps for storing music and image files) and USB 2.0 so you should be able to attach it to other Sony gadgets.</p> <p><strong>Novelty</strong> PSP is set to be a complete multimedia entertainment solution as useful for watching movies (the console's Universal Media Discs can hold two hours of DVD quality video) and listening to music (7.1 channels and 3D sound support) as playing games. Meanwhile, DS features a touch screen that will give players a new way to interact with game menus and characters, and a built in microphone for voice commands. There are two completely different philosophies at work here. Sony is saying, 'yeah, we do games, but we do other cool stuff as well'. Nintendo is saying 'DS will do games in completely new and interesting ways'. Both are valid and interesting - depending on what you want to get out of your handheld gaming device.</p> <p><strong>Portability</strong> PSP dimensions are 170mm x 74mm x 23mm with a weight of 260g. DS weighs in at 148.7 x 84.7mm X 28.9mm and 275g (including battery &amp; stylus) making Nintendo's machine slightly shorter and chubbier - the latter due to a clam shell design that harks back to the days of the multiscreen <a href=\"http://www.gameandwatch.com/\">Game And Watch</a>. So, the PSP will fit better in your pocket, but the DS has a protected screen. And a stylus! In terms of battery life, Nintendo reckons you'll get 6-10 hours of gameplay from a fully charged DS battery, while Sony has yet to announce an official figure, although rumours suggest it could be a more modest 2.5 hours of continuous play.</p> <p><strong>Affordability</strong> Sony Europe president Chris Deering recently told trade publication MCV that PSP would come in \"closer to \u00a3200 than \u00a3300.\" The Nintendo DS is launching in the US at $149.99 which will probably translate to \u00a3149.99 reflecting the loveable way in which manufacturers like to charge us more for things for no discernable reason. That's still likely to be \u00a380 cheaper than the PSP though.</p> <p>Okay so I've entirely glossed over elements such as graphics processors, CPUs, etc, but its easy to get seduced by the internals of these machines before you actually get to see the games. Don't be. All we can judge at the moment are the priorities of the manufacturers. And just as in the 'battle' between PS2 and GameCube, Sony's machine has the sex appeal and the big brands, while Nintendo has the quirky ideas and near-autistic focus on game design. It should be an interesting scrap.</p>",
  "Michael Howard will today make a dramatic attempt to win the trust of disillusioned voters by promising to sack cabinet ministers who fail to deliver the detailed election promises on target. <p>In a self-lacerating address to the party faithful and the wider television audience, the Conservative leader will admit during his speech to the party's conference in Bournemouth: \"Politicians seem to live in a different world, where promises are dropped just as casually as they are made, a world where there are no penalties for failure.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard received a boost today when it emerged that Paul Sykes, the Yorkshire millionaire who has been the main Ukip financial backer, has fallen out with Robert Kilroy-Silk over his wholehearted endorsement of the party's weekend decision to \"kill off\" the Conservatives. </p> <p>Mr Sykes, who contributed nearly half of Ukip's \u00a32m fighting fund for this year's European elections, said the policy of fielding candidates who could unseat Eurosceptic Tory MPs at the next election meant he could no longer support them. The decision will be a huge relief to Mr Howard and a reward for his hardline policy on Europe. </p> <p>The news came as David Davis, the shadow home secretary, admitted Ukip had the ability to really damage Conservative fortunes, estimating they could cost as many seats as the Referendum party in 1997 - between 30 and 50. Mr Sykes, who has welcomed Mr Howard's tougher line on Europe, said Ukip had \"blown it\". </p> <p>The Conservative leader will break with tradition by making his keynote conference speech on a Tuesday, much as Labour leaders have long done, as part of his desperate attempt to restore momentum and credibility to a party battered by defeat for a decade. </p> <p>The detailed \"timetable for action\" which the Tories are publishing in daily instalments includes \"specific times, specific dates, no wriggle room\", Mr Howard will say, a day after his chief lieutenant, Oliver Letwin, promised smaller government and lower taxes - without yet being specific. </p> <p>Mr Howard will say: \"Everyone will be able to hold us to account, no dodgy facts and figures, we'll have no place to hide. I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver. And if they don't I'll replace them with people who will.\" It would be a hostage to fortune if Mr Howard's prospects were better, although Lord Saatchi, his party co-chairman, said in Bournemouth that, if there was a snap election this autumn, his private polling suggested there would be a hung parliament. </p> <p>But as the Conservative leader put the finishing touches to his speech in the wake of yesterday's Times/Populus poll which put him in worse shape than the purged Iain Duncan Smith a year ago, a fresh poll for BBC Newsnight heaped further gloom on him. </p> <p>Only 12% of voters believe Mr Howard, now 63, will ever be prime minister, with even 65% of Tory supporters among the 78% overall doubters. Nearly twice as many people believe the Lib Dems are a more effective opposition, 42% compared with 22%. Mr Howard's recent anti-war stance over Iraq is widely attributed to mere point-scoring. The Times poll showed his party slipping back, on 28% to Labour's 35%, barely above the Lib Dems on 25%. </p> <p>Mr Howard's private polling almost certainly confirms such alarming impressions and is likely to have prompted today's masochistic admission of past error, as well as what is billed as a \"highly personal section\" about the core of his beliefs. This confessional section will also include detail about the death of his mother-in-law more than two years ago as a result of a hospital-acquired infection. \"It's a tragedy for thousands of families - including mine,\" Mr Howard plans to say. </p> <p>With senior Tories trumpeting the \"right to choose\" in public services as the real road to social justice, one flagship Tory initiative to pave the way for tax cuts was cast into doubt last night hours after being deployed in a conference video. </p> <p>To the delight of Labour, Tim Yeo, shadow transport and environment secretary, made clear that he would not be bound by a party special review of government spending by one-time Dome troubleshooter David James which has so far identified \u00a315bn pounds of savings in government spending. These will eventually be used to fund tax cuts. Mr Yeo told the environment magazine ENDS Report: \"It isn't a priority for me.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Tories pledged today to scrap the beleaguered family court service in a bid to ensure fathers and grandparents get better access to their children.</p> <p>In a clear nod to the cause championed by activist group Fathers4Justice, the shadow spokeswoman for families, Theresa May, promised to axe the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass).</p> <p>In a separate move, she also pledged to replace the family court system with a new mediation service.</p> <p>Ms May called the introduction of Cafcass under Labour \"the biggest mistake in family policy\", and said her party would seek to abolish it to end \"the heartbroken stories\" of parents denied fair access to their kids. </p> <p>\"It is a bureaucratic shambles, it is deeply unjust and it is letting families down,\" she said.</p> <p>In a confused message she blamed Cafcass for decisions actually made by family courts. The role of Cafcass is to coordinate the work of guardians who support children involved in custody disputes.</p> <p>The body has been beset with problems since the decision to abolish the self-employed status of guardians, which led to many leaving the service.</p> <p>Ms May said that within the first month of a Tory government, a bill would be drawn up giving a \"presumption of co-parenting and a right for both parents to be involved in bringing up their children where couples separate\".</p> <p>\"We will ensure that the law serves the best interest of the child - and children deserve to see both parents.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Courts should be the last resort, not the first. The aim will be to intervene early to make sure disputes don't have to go to court but are sorted out quickly in the best interests of the children.\"</p> <p>In an apparent reference to situations involving domestic violence, Ms May added that \"child safety will remain a priority\".</p> <p>She also struck an inclusive note for families, acknowledging unmarried and gay couples as families - while still asserting the Tory preference for marriage as \"the best environment for bringing up children\".</p> <p>Tacitly conceding previous Tory failures to \"properly\" represent family in government, which is placed \"under threat as never before\", Ms May nevertheless failed to announce anything else directly targeting families or women.</p> <p><strong> Drop in female vote</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, a report out today claimed that the Conservative party is going in \"reverse gear\" in its bid to woo women voters, further dimming its prospects at the next general election.</p> <p>Only a quarter of women voters are satisfied with Michael Howard's performance, with his tenure more popular among male voters, according to a report published today by the Fawcett Society.</p> <p>Dr Katherine Rake, director of the Fawcett Society, said: \"This report shows that the Conservatives still have a long way to go if they want to win back women's votes. </p> <p>\"The party urgently needs to formulate convincing policies that will appeal to the female electorate if they are to recover electorally. And in order for these policies to be credible, they must be presented and delivered by more women.\"</p> <p><strong>Increasing female representation</strong><br></p> <p>Tory delegate Joan Spiers said that more female Tories in senior positions would be unlikely because of an unfair selection process. </p> <p>\"I would like to see an even-handed deal,\" she said. \"The selection process is usually the twin-set-and-pearls brigade and a lot of men. If they get a young, attractive, striving young woman they often reject her. I have often heard people say, 'you should be at home with your children'.\"</p> <p>Surrey county councillor Marian Myland agreed: \"I want to see them do more,\" she said. \"I want to them to say something about women's problems that they are not yet addressing, such as more tax breaks for childcare and elderly care and education.\"</p> <p>Crawley Tory councillor Kirstie Heal disagreed, however: \"The ethos of the Tory party for me is equal to men and women. </p> <p>\"It is about families, it is about supporting small government. I believe this applies to all ages. It is a worry for me that the policies are not appealing. When we were canvassing we didn't find women found that. They were equally as engaged as men.\"</p>",
  "<p>It would surely be an act of vandalism on the part of Haringey council to tear down the facade of the Gaudi-style shop in Muswell Hill (Homage to Gaudi splits community, October 4). This structure is not just a retail outlet - it is a work of art, which brings a sense of humanity to the regimental plastic parades of high street shop fronts nationwide. </p> <p>The Arts Council has spent billions over the years commissioning architectural \"carbuncles\" and miserable abstract and conceptual installations. As a result, the postwar public environment has become dehumanised. Chris Ostwald has brought a small glimpse of Art Nouveau to a London suburb. This type of initiative should be commended, not destroyed.<br><strong>Sarah O'Flanagan</strong><br>Oxford</p>",
  "Forty years after the government chopped the heart out of Yorkshire's railways, civil servants are to meet in Leeds to appeal for help in reopening lines and getting branch services running again. <p>The ground-breaking initiative will see the launch of a national \"rail re-opening toolkit\" devised by Whitehall to encourage councils and local enthusiasts to find money and expertise to put services back on the rails. </p> <p>Sanctioned by the deputy prime minister John Prescott, whose department includes transport and the environment, the move aims to see more and faster commuter services into cities such as Leeds. </p> <p>Wider connections are also encouraged - for instance, from West Yorkshire to the north east and Teesside, if the old line between Ripon and Northallerton is reopened. </p> <p>\"There has been a recognised procedure for closing railway lines for a long time, back to Dr Beeching in the 1960s,\" said David Fanaroff, senior adviser at the Countryside Agency, which has drawn up the toolkit, a portfolio of documents, contacts and legal advice. </p> <p>\"But until now, there has been nothing similar to deliver the reopening of disused lines. This toolkit has been created to tackle that imbalance. </p> <p>\"It will help statutory authorities and community groups all the way through the process.\" </p> <p>The Leeds meeting follows a report on possible rail reopenings in the Yorkshire and Humber region which the Country side Agency published last year. That delighted long-standing pressure groups by identifying a string of weed-infested routes which local pressure, plus funding packages from Whitehall and Europe, could realistically get going again. </p> <p>The toolkit is designed to keep up the pressure, not just in the north but nationwide. Mr Fanaroff said: \"Rail reopening may not yet be at the heart of government transport policy, but it's clear that there is considerable interest in its potential.\" </p> <p>Delegates from the Independent Rail Consultants Group and the Association of Community Rail Partnerships will be at the meeting on October 15. </p> <p>The kit is also aimed at encouraging new links between the main rail network and thriving tourist railways such as the steam services which puff up to Haworth and across the North York Moors. </p> <p>Economic studies have shown major potential from new connections between Whitby, an unemployment blackspot off-season, and the Teesside towns. </p> <p>Mr Prescott's department is showing renewed interest in encouraging DIY rail restoration, as the government's 10-year transport strategy, launched in 1997, fails to meet its pledge to shift travellers out of their cars. One of the main obstacles is considered to be the gap in public transport. </p> <p>Leeds is also anxious to improve public transport in and out of the city, with the current economic boom at risk of being hampered by overcrowded trains, and - if commuters give up on public transport - jammed roads.</p>",
  "<b>Yesterday</b> <br> <p>The sun came out and party chairman Liam Fox tried to rally Tories in his opening speech. \"This is our last conference in opposition,\" he claimed - though opinion polls suggested otherwise. </p> <p>David Cameron and John Redwood slugged it out for the title of star of the day.

  "<p>The world has changed since 9/11. Or at least, in some instances - such as when boarding an aeroplane - we hope it has. But what impact has the increased threat of global terrorism really had on large service organisations in the tourist industry that are considered targets, but that also have to negotiate the more mundane difficulties of running an organisation day-to-day?</p> <p>New research being conducted by Dr Bridgette Sullivan-Taylor, of the Warwick Business School, aims to tackle this subject. \"Previous research I've done has concentrated on business strategy,\" she says. \"I started my PhD in 1998, on global strategy in the global service sector. I looked particularly at BA and what the facilitators and inhibitors were for a company that operates 24/7, 365 days a year, all around the world. Then last year, I did a study on international tourism management and the key thing that emerged from that was the impact terrorism has had.\"</p> <p>With a two-year Leverhulme Trust early career grant, Sullivan-Taylor will look at the impact of terrorism on organisations, and the changes that have taken place within them as a result of heightened awareness. \"I want to know if organisations really do implement major changes, or do they take their eye off the ball once the immediate anxiety has gone? Do they make long-term strategic changes or just knee-jerk reactions? And how do they implement those changes in the face of all the other normal pressures they have?\"</p> <p>Conversely, companies may have pounced on terrorism as a way of making strategic overhauls. \"I'll look at what American companies have been able to change in the wake of 9/11. It gave them an excuse to hurry through reforms that they might have been wanting to make for years.\"</p> <p>She believes airlines and other companies that may become targets for terrorism face unique strategic challenges. \"It's very common in business for strategy to become patchy anyway. There's often a big gap between the thinking and the acting out, but this is obviously life-threatening. It's a question of constant research and vigilance.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the nature of these companies brings additional dimensions to consider. \"So many third parties are involved at an airport, for example. There's no consistent standard, even in that one place. But a plane also travels across borders, to places with wildly different cultural standards and security situations.\"</p> <p>Sullivan-Taylor's research will cover many complementary areas. \"History, because terrorism isn't a new phenomenon; anthropology; geography; economics, especially the effect on the tourist economy in the wake of a terrorist attack; marketing; leisure and tourism; political science; psychology and the fear of travel; sociology; education, and how we simulate extreme situations for the purpose of staff training; international relations; and cultural policy.</p> <p>\"A lot of the research will depend on how much access I can get to security information. I'll go outside the UK, too, and look comparatively at US companies. I've already been contacted by the FBI, which is interested in the results of the studies.\"</p> <p>Despite the high awareness of international terrorism, research into this subject is unusual: \"In America the department of homeland security is conducting lots of research into terrorism and its impact. That isn't happening here.\"</p> <p>In her view, it should be. \"Tourism is the biggest industry in the world and it needs to be considered strategically and taken seriously. To keep people coming to your country the factors that might inhibit them need to be looked at and addressed. Hopefully, when my research is finished, government agencies and businesses will be able to use it for that purpose.\"</p>",
  "<p>When visiting the Cotswold village of Bourton on the Water, it is hard to resist viewing the model of the village, which itself contains a model of the village. \"The village within the village\" is an image of how a school relates to its local community. </p> <p>Most schools extend practice beyond the classroom into the community - a school becomes a community within a community. In addition, members of the school community will also be members of their local community: as such, they will reflect the beliefs and values of that community. These will be conveyed through the behaviour and attitudes of the school community.</p> <p>The principles on which community provision is built are based on certain assumptions: education is part of social provision, strongly related to all other branches of social provision. Education does not exist as an academic entity in its own social vacuum: social provision is determined by the social and economic framework of society.</p> <p>Historically, social and educational provision have become more centrally controlled, while at the local level there has been a move towards the provision of activities led by the community, with a greater emphasis on participation.</p> <p>If we accept that schools are communities with local needs, pupils, teachers, parents, governors and support agencies need to relate to each other, and share an understanding of the goals and targets of an effective school. The more isolated teachers feel, the harder it will be for them to function. The organisational structure of the school would benefit by reflecting the psychological and sociological make-up of its community.</p> <p>A comprehensive community plan may not be a cure-all for problems in the classroom, corridor and playground, or beyond the school gates, but in the process of identifying the needs of the school as a community, teachers, support agencies and managers can create a community ethos appropriate to their school.</p> <p>A school is more than a building. All members of the school will need to take responsibility for the environment and the people that make up the community. This includes the building and its use, and a management structure that accommodates all staff and key stakeholders.</p> <p>By identifying the needs of the school, all members of the school community can develop a structure that suits their school. For example, parents will need to know the system that enables them to discuss their child's education with the appropriate professional - a teacher, health visitor, social worker or educational welfare officer. Parents also need to understand the boundaries between the acceptable and unacceptable.</p> <p>Clear communication will lead to clearer understanding and shared values. An emphasis on community will reflect a caring, sharing ideology, which will provide each school with a framework that focuses on people, not structures. Such practices will lead to improved home-school relations and broader usage of the school for the whole community. The village within the village will become the community within the community.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Sonia Blandford is dean of education at Canterbury Christ Church University College. <a href=\"mailto:masterclass@cant.ac.uk\">masterclass@cant.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>I remember being fairly keen on school, but I had to be pushed - if I didn't like the subject, I couldn't be bothered. It was the 1980s and what I really remember was the fashion and music; that's what I was most interested in. I didn't know what I wanted to do, so after school I went straight into work. Maybe if I'd been more studious, I'd have felt the call of university more strongly; but once I was earning a wage, and frittering it away on everything I wanted, there was no way I was going back to college.</p> <p>I'm glad I didn't go to university then. Having work experience behind me has given me the confidence to go back into education. When I think back to what friends of mine who went straight to university told me about it, I don't think I would have done much studying.</p> <p>Now, I'm lucky to work for a company that has always advocated continuing your education, and there's corporate sponsorship, which means I'm 80% funded. I am still working full-time though. I asked for study days, which they were happy to let me have - but fitting them in is the problem.</p> <p>I've done my first level in social sciences at the Open University and it's a totally different experience of education - definitely my favourite. We look at social issues that affect us, like crime, the family, global threats and changes. I chose the subject because I could associate it with everyday experiences, and see the effects of what I was studying in day-to-day life. Going back into education was daunting enough, so I wanted a subject I could relate to. For my next level I'm going to do politics - again, because it has that effect on everyday life.</p> <p>As well as the obvious pleasure of learning for its own sake, you develop other skills. I'm learning how to write, to structure an argument, to debate and to look at evidence. I'm used to doing lots of reading during the day for my job, but this is a different kind of reading. I do feel it's reactivated some neglected parts of my brain.</p> <p>When you start, you immediately revert to being 12, sitting at the back of the class and praying the tutor won't pick on you. But my tutor is fantastic and the Open University provides amazing support. You really feel like you could call at 3am to talk a problem through - not that they'd thank you if you did. There's such a variety of ages and backgrounds in the Open University, too.</p> <p>You do forget how time-consuming study is, especially when you are used to being able to relax on the sofa in front of the TV. You just have to discipline yourself - and I'm very lucky that my other half makes me study if I show signs of slacking off. But I'm doing it because I want to, so I'm going to put the effort in, for myself.</p> <p>To be honest, if I'd known how much work was involved, I'd maybe not have done it. But now I know, I still want to carry on. I'm really lucky that I enjoy it - I'd have been devastated to have gone back and not been happy. But I've been so fortunate with my course and tutor. I can't praise them enough.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lisa Rae is 39 and has been studying at the Open University since February</p>",
  "<p>At the end of last month, Ofsted published a report showing that the number of pupils taking modern languages at GCSE is expected to drop sharply this year, after a 30% decline in take-up. It inspired David Bell, the chief inspector of schools, to make an impassioned plea for action.</p> <p>\"Schools, teachers and parents must now work to ensure that pupils recognise the benefits of learning a foreign language, and make sure that young people have the opportunity and desire to continue studying modern foreign languages at key stage 4 and beyond,\" he said.</p> <p>Au contraire, said Stephen Twigg, the junior schools minister. \"We do not want to go back to the old days when we tried to force-feed languages to 15-year-olds who had no aptitude or interest.\"</p> <p>That statement caused some bemusement in council offices across England. This is the same Stephen Twigg who, on July 5, wrote a letter to all local education authority (LEA) chief education officers under the heading \"Languages entitlement 14-16\". The letter has since been passed to the Guardian. \"In the knowledge society of the 21st century, language competence and intercultural understanding are not optional extras, they are an essential part of being a citizen,\" Twigg said.</p> <p>He went on: \"It is therefore a matter of some concern that we are receiving reports that schools are reducing languages provision, in some cases significantly. Schools remain under a statutory requirement to offer languages at KS4 so that young people have an entitlement to take languages as an option.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) insisted there was no contradiction in these statements. \"We just want to ensure that anyone who wants to study modern languages at GCSE can do so.\"</p> <p>However, the message taken in town halls was that the government was still utterly behind modern languages at KS4 and that it was up to the LEAs to sort out the situation.</p> <p>\"LEAs have no control over the curriculum and ministers know that full well,\" says Graham Lane, chairman of the 14-19 education group for the Local Government Association. \"If schools are dropping modern languages, it's a direct result of government policy.</p> <p>\"I told ministers that making foreign languages optional would be a disaster, and it's proved to be the case. The government has done schoolchildren a huge disservice. They've reduced the employability of young people at a stroke.\"</p> <p>Back in 2002, the DfES published its national languages strategy. It sounded bold and innovative, starting with the statement: \"For too long we have failed to value language skills or recognise the contribution to society, to the economy and to raising standards in schools. This has led to a national cycle of underperformance.\"</p> <p>The strategy continued by calling for increased provision in primary schools. But the most significant change was the downgrading of modern languages from compulsory to an \"entitlement\".</p> <p>The DfES apparatchiks apparently believed they had found in \"entitlement\" a word that would get them off the hook of charges of cultural philistinism. Put simply, it meant schools were obliged to offer at least one modern language at KS4, but pupils were not obliged to study it. Even though the changes were not officially due to come in until last month, many schools chose to scale back their language provision immediately.</p> <p>\"It has become increasingly hard to recruit good language teachers,\" says one headteacher, \"and many schools would rather abandon the unequal struggle rather than deliver an unsatisfactory curriculum. Modern languages tend to be perceived both as irrelevant, as English is a global language, and academically difficult. With schools under league table pressure to get five GCSE passes at A*-C, many are pushing students into subjects that are considered to be easier.\"</p> <p>Numbers taking languages at GCSE have gone into freefall. To take just one exam board: in 2002, the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) had 73,000 candidates for GCSE French. By 2003, that number had declined to 55,000, and this year was down still further, to just 46,000.</p> <p>Teresa Tinsley, assistant director of communications for CILT, the National Centre for Languages, says the government rather misjudged the effects of its actions. \"My impression is that it was rather taken aback by the speed with which so many schools effectively dropped languages. It introduced the changes too soon.\"</p> <p>Tinsley is keen to point out that all is not lost. \"There are schools in Sheffield and the Black Country looking at alternate models of teaching languages, such as combining them with business,\" she says. \"But there needs to be a great deal more. It's not just the government we have to convince - it's the schools, the parents and the teachers.\"</p> <p>Grove school in Market Drayton, Shropshire, has battled the odds and achieved specialist status in modern languages. \"It's been good for the school,\" says headteacher Richard Arrowsmith. \"We've had enormously positive results with our outreach work, teaching languages in 10 local primary schools.\"</p> <p>But Arrowsmith is now fed up. He could just about cope with the changes in the curriculum, but he believes he is fighting a second offensive with the AQA. Something strange has happened to his school's results. And it appears it is not the only one to be hit. \"In 2003, our first year of specialist status, our A-C GCSE passes in French fell from 50% to just 27%. One girl who got nine As or A*s in other subjects, got just a D. That can't be right.</p> <p>\"Our passes in German and Italian also fell, though not so significantly. We were shocked, but thought it was possible we had taken our eye off the ball while establishing the new systems demanded by our specialist status,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We should have asked for re-marks then and there, as our results this summer have been little better. It's possible that our teaching isn't up to scratch, but I really don't think this is the case. We have some great teachers and I have sat in on many of their lessons and can find no fault with them.\"</p> <p>After the publication of the AQA GCSE results this summer, an online modern languages forum for teachers went white-hot. \"Has anyone out there had a disaster today with their GCSE results cos we have?\" was one posting. There were dozens of replies: \"To say I had a few disappointed kids is an understatement,\" said one. Another read: \"This year we had an unprecedented 60% Ds\" and \"God, I'm working hard not to take this all personally\".</p> <p>AQA admits there was a national drop in A-C passes of 2.4% across the three exam boards - AQA, Edexcel and OCR - in 2003, but says adjustments were made and results are now back on track. The schools don't quite see it that way.</p> <p>\"The problems began two years ago when AQA changed the regulations and no longer allowed the use of dictionaries,\" says Maria Richards, Grove's former head of modern languages. \"However, the standard of question remained the same, so the exam became de facto harder.\"</p> <p>AQA denies this. \"We did make allowances for the absence of a dictionary,\" a spokesperson says. \"For instance, instead of asking a candidate to order a loaf of bread, he or she is now allowed to choose their own item of food.\"</p> <p>But it's not just the dictionaries that have been at issue. \"I taught a class of C/D candidates and tutored them thoroughly in what standard they needed to achieve,\" says Chris Pollard, a modern languages teacher at Grove school. \"I sat in on their speaking exam and ticked the boxes as each candidate fulfilled the relevant task. I was confident half of the class of 22 had done enough to get a C. In the event only four were given a C. I just don't understand how it was marked.\"</p> <p>AQA insists it is more than happy to look at any individual problems a school may have, but a comparison of the French GCSE results in 2004 across the three boards does tell an interesting story. Just 49.8% of those sitting AQA got a C or better, while the figure for Edexcel was 61.4% and that for OCR was 70.2%.</p> <p>Arrowsmith has a few thoughts on what happened. \"It has been the less able students who have been dropping out of modern languages,\" he says. \"Although exams are supposed to be criterion-referenced, it's possible that the shift in ability has seen the pass mark raise, as students who were formerly in the middle band of achievement are now near the bottom.\"</p> <p>So it could be harder to get the same grade, adding to the disincentive to take languages. Poor results mean even fewer students will go on to AS and A2, and KS3 students will see no point in working at all.</p> <p>\"The government is stuck in a cleft stick,\" says Stephen Fawkes, trustee for the Association of Language Learning. \"Only last week, Denis MacShane, the minister for Europe, was talking up the value of modern languages, while the DfES is effectively sidelining them. It's hard to see the government putting its hands up and admitting it got it wrong, because that's not what governments do.\"</p>",
  "<p>October is black history month. The occasion has become a key part of the academic calendar, providing opportunities for fascinating work across the curriculum capable of broadening pupils' sense of themselves and of the past. Across the country, special black history events and exhibitions are planned and there are some exceptional resources online.</p> <p>Ask your pupils what comes to mind when they think of Tudor times. However great their knowledge, it is unlikely that many of them will have heard of John Blanke - the first recorded black Londoner - but exist he did, enjoying a prominent role among the court musicians of both Henry VII and VIII. His image is thought to have survived on a 60-foot painted roll depicting a lavish tournament of 1511 in Westminster, which celebrated Catherine of Aragon giving birth to a (short-lived) royal heir. Students can view the image and read about him on the National Archive's Black Presence website (<a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/early_times/blanke.htm\"> www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/early_times/blanke.htm</a>).</p> <p>In the same period, there were also black men and women at the court of James IV of Scotland. Long before them there had been black legions in the north. The emperor Septimus Severus was born in Libya (Leptis Magna) and ended his days in York (Eboracum) in AD 211. There are details about him and far more besides at the National Archive site, all of which can be used as the basis of assemblies, displays, talks and discussions.</p> <p><strong>Black history only in October?</strong></p> <p>This would make an interesting topic for discussion among students in history, English and citizenship lessons. It is one that exercises history teachers, too, many of whom feel it is a shame that there is a need for a black history month at all. They argue that the part played by black and Asian people in world history should feature naturally across the curriculum all year.</p> <p>A good place to join the debate and gather ideas for classroom discussion might be the forum at <a href=\"http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?show topic=1894&amp;st=0\"> http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?show topic=1894&amp;st=0</a>. Alternatively, visit Dan Lyden's online seminar at <a href=\"http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=1518\">www.schoolhistory.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=1518</a>.</p> <p><strong>Does black history matter?</strong></p> <p>It is essential that all children gain a sense of the past that is as sophisticated as possible and does not always come back to certain standard received ideas. The history of black Britons is far broader than the slave trade and the arrival of the Windrush, and Commonwealth citizens seeking new opportunity in the \"mother country\" in the late 1940s - however central these events were.</p> <p>Ask students why a focus on black history that emphasised only these elements might be partial. The part played by every race in the creation and maintenance of the British empire in peace and war is an answer, and can be developed via links at Runnymede Trust's site (<a href=\"http://www.realhistories.org.uk\">http://www.realhistories.org.uk</a>).</p> <p>Nor is the story of immigration into Britain a recent or West Indian monopoly, as students can discover through research in libraries and online. Encourage them to search the main black history month site (<a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/ history/index.html\">http://www.irr.org.uk/history/index.html</a>) or the Moving Here site (<a href=\"http://www.movinghere.org.uk\">www.movinghere.org.uk</a>). The latter is a vast resource, with a teachers' page, of freely downloadable community contributions - from personal thoughts to family photographs. Topics include music and art.</p> <p><strong>Famous black and Asian Britons</strong></p> <p>A principal element of black history month last year was the appeal for nominations for the top 100 black Britons. The fact that the official exercise is over does not preclude running the same kind of event in schools this year, using the brief autobiographies at the project's site (<a href=\"http://www.100greatblackbritons.com/list.html\">www.100greatblackbritons.com/list.html</a>).</p> <p>Put students in groups to research the entire database and come up with their nomination for the greatest black Briton, whom they can then argue for in class. A more targeted approach for younger pupils might involve celebrating the lives of those people who emerged in the top 10, including Mary Seacole, Olaudah Equiano or Queen Philippa of Hainault.</p> <p>The fact that the full nomination list sprang from every walk of life and profession means no department in the school need miss out on highlighting a key black individual. For more on Mary Seacole see a recent Guardian Unlimited article at <a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/review/story/0,,1147393,00.html\">http://books.theguardian.com/review/story/0,,1147393,00.html</a>. This could be offered to older students to boil down to form the basis of a letter to the librarian or headteacher asking for permission to put up a display about her in the library or school entrance hall. </p> <p><strong>Black history - not just in London</strong></p> <p>Of course, there have been prominent black and Asian populations in cities all over the UK (some for centuries) and no study of this topic should ignore that fact. The National Archive site provides a series of virtual tours of Bristol and Liverpool, as well as London. There are also tons of resources at the following museum sites in Liverpool (<a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/hamlyn/blackhistory/index.asp\"> http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/hamlyn/blackhistory/index.asp</a>), Birmingham (<a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ ITEM_ID=45015&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=126\">www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ ITEM_ID=45015&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=126</a>) and Bristol (<a href=\"http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/events.htm#bhm\">www.empiremuseum.co.uk/events.htm#bhm</a>).</p> <p>Another key point of departure for all manner of research is the National Maritime Museum, which for the past 18 months has been involved with the new Understanding Slavery Initiative. See <a href=\"http://www.nmm.ac.uk/site/request/setTemplate:singlecontent/contentTypeA/conWebDoc/contentId/16093\">www.nmm.ac.uk/site/request/setTemplate:singlecontent/contentTypeA/conWebDoc/contentId/16093</a>.</p> <p>Slavery remains a global problem.

Use it as a model to capture the life history of a black or Asian figure from the past.</p> <p>Ask students to investigate heraldry at the College of Arms (<a href=\"http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/01.htm\">www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/01.htm</a>) and then create their own arms designs for one or more of the great black Britons.</p> <p>Black history month emphasises local and personal history. If yours is an ethnically diverse school, celebrate the rich cultural roots of your pupils and the histories of the countries from which they and their families originally hail. Ask them to record their local and family history work using digital cameras, digital video or tape recordings.</p> <p><strong>Key Stage 4 (age 14-16)</strong><br> Black history and the British empire have played a major part in the development of the English language. Investigate the history and evolution of words. Bill Bryson's book Mother Tongue is an excellent resource.</p> <p>If you are still considering a Shakespeare play to study at GCSE, why not choose Othello? Discuss the representation of the Moor of Venice and the almost casual racism of Iago. Does the play undermine prejudice by making Othello a figure of tragic power or does his fateful end seem to reinforce certain stereotypes?</p> <p>In art, study black people in paintings and art (see <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/multicultural/ black_britons_01.shtml\"> http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/multicultural/black_britons_01.shtml</a>).

  "<p>I qualified in 2001 from Napier University with a degree in animal biology. Before that I was at Falkirk College doing an HND in applied ecology. I liked the way the course at Falkirk was run - it was innovative and informative, and the tutors were top-class. So when the opportunity came up to work there I jumped at it.</p> <p>The variety is what I enjoy: the different students we get through the doors, the opportunity to teach various subjects in my field and the combination of class-based theory and being able to go out to teach in the field. Almost weekly we carry out ecological surveying, which is animal population distribution, and look at terrestrial freshwater and mini-eco systems. In my conservation and ecology class there are seven students. They range from late teens/early 20s to late 30s/early 40s. I teach another 20 in my biology classes.</p> <p>My conservation and ecology colleagues meet monthly to keep in touch with each others' areas. There are two lecturers and one senior lecturer. We get on well and have a very good working relationship with the other departments.</p> <p>The college provides its own personal development and we're also encouraged to seek our own. I'm updating my computer literacy, doing things like advanced PowerPoint presentation.</p> <p>Ecology is a dynamic area and a fairly new science, so I keep up to date by attending Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management meetings.</p> <p>The environment department recently received an excellent report from HMI [Her Majesty's Inspectorate]. We were praised for being at the cutting edge of environmental technology through developing online learning - <a href=\"http://www.ecolearning.com\">www.ecolearning.com</a> - which helps businesses improve their environmental image.</p> <p>At the moment, Falkirk College is definitely the place for me. Environment is currently high on the government's agenda, so it looks like we'll be teaching it for a while yet.</p>",
  "It was a staple of 1960s science fiction that the future would involve flying cars and holidays on the moon. While the mass-production flying car hasn't yet hit the showrooms, the prospects for space tourism have taken a few steps closer. California's Mojave desert yesterday saw the successful return of SpaceShipOne from its second trip into the brink of outer space. In doing so, it became eligible to win the $10m Ansari \"X Prize\" to be awarded to the first privately built craft to make the trip into space carrying the weight of three passengers and return safely twice within two weeks. By travelling at least 62 miles high, the flights touch the fringes of space proper, allowing those on board to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. <p>Richard Branson is already alive to the potentials of space tourism, and has signed a deal with Burt Rutan, the designer behind SpaceShipOne, to exploit his shuttlecock-inspired technology for commercial purposes. The craft's flight is being hailed as a success for US know-how and private sector parsimony. Partly funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, SpaceShipOne cost around $20m-$30m to complete, a fraction of the cost of multibillion-dollar Nasa projects. That ignores the ability of private entrepreneurs to piggy-back on Nasa's hard-earned research, or their ability to take greater risks with private sector lives as well as livelihoods. </p> <p>The advent of private space travel raises all sorts of regulatory issues that have yet to be solved - and the size of Mr Branson's insurance bill could yet put him off. Some will be concerned that with the environment already suffering from the effects of conventional air travel, the impact of commercial space travel should be carefully monitored. Space tourism may still be many years away, and at an estimated \u00a3100,000 a ride is unlikely to rival the Costas as a popular family destination. But what Mr Rutan's triumph opens up is a barnstorming era similar to the early 20th century, when aviation pioneers such as Bleriot, Lindburgh and Batten blazed new trails for others to follow.</p>",
  "<p>Larry Summers strides into the waiting area outside his office, and shakes my hand before I am out of the chair. It's a beautiful, warm afternoon at Harvard, a week and a day into term. Freshmen beam and all but skip across the Old Yard. Lovers - or maybe just friends - sit back-to-back, reading hefty textbooks. Outside the science building, the stand for the Harvard cheerleaders is making a lot more noise than its only competition, two serious men in orange T-shirts by the Stop the War table.</p> <p>It's weather to take it easy in, but already today Summers, Harvard president (the US version of vice-chancellor) has met a star academic he is trying to recruit to the biology department; spoken to the search committee, which is looking for a new dean of the school of design; liaised with the financial vice-president about guidelines for next year's budgets; lunched with a professor of government about plans for quantitative research in the social sciences; and talked to the community affairs staff about their work in Cambridge, the corner of Boston where Harvard lives. Later he will host a reception for a faculty member who is going to be a professor, and stop by another reception that brings together academics and students concerned with human rights issues. It's not, he says, an atypical day.</p> <p>A few months after George Bush took over at the White House, Summers, Bill Clinton's last Treasury secretary, moved into a not extravagantly large office in Massachusetts Hall, below student lodgings. He is Harvard's 27th president, a new link in a chain that began with Henry Dunster, a clergyman from Bury, in 1640, four years after the college was founded, making it the post with the longest continuous history in the US.</p> <p>This job carries on, just as before, regardless of whether Bush wins again. On some issues, such as financial aid for students or stem cell research, it might make a difference who is in the White House, but not much. \"One of the great differences between working at Harvard and working in Washington is that the time frames are very different,\" Summers says. \"In Washington the long run is the next news magazine, Monday. Here, scholars are trying to write books that will influence thought 50 years from now. I don't think the fundamental importance of what we do is much affected by who is in power at any particular moment.\"</p> <p>Since long before Summers took over, Harvard has been just about universally recognised as the most successful university in the world. It leads the latest league table, produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, of global higher education institutions. Forty Nobel prize-winners work, or have worked, here. The value of its endowment has gone up from $19.3bn (\u00a310.7bn) to $22.6bn (\u00a312.6bn) in a year. The cut used for running costs, a mere $800m (\u00a3444.7m), supplies just a third of the university's income. Despite fees of $39,880 (\u00a322,118), including board and lodging, it continues to attract the best applicants and turns them away at a ratio of about nine to one.</p> <p>There will be plenty of people who wince at those fees. But when British ministers and vice-chancellors look to learn, they tend to look here first, and not just because Harvard is cash-rich. Viz last month's Schwartz report, which encouraged UK admissions officers to adopt the Harvard model.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Summers's three years in charge have not been trouble-free. He has a combative style and gets people's backs up in a way his predecessor, Neil Rudenstine, would not have dreamed of. Summers was in the middle of a row very early on, when the black scholar Cornel West took umbrage at his questioning of the high grades West was awarding and at criticism of a rap CD he made with the Rev Al Sharpton. (West later left for Princeton, and Summers only just held on to the celebrated leader of the African-American studies department, Henry Louis Gates.)</p> <p>He challenged departments to make savings, publicly ordering the Kennedy school of government to get into the black; and, for a time last year, Harvard hands tell the Guardian, the place was awash with nerves, as form-filling and back-covering inhibited academics. He has launched a vast and potentially hazardous review of undergraduate study, to inject more internationalism and, especially, science into the curriculum, with the expectation that every student will go abroad to study, and that each will know the difference between a gene and a chromosome. He also proposes students delaying specialisation in a particular subject until their final year. And professors watch with awe and some trepidation the small matter of plans to build on 260 acres the university has acquired at Allston, just over the Charles river. This will mean some schools being asked to move out of their current homes.</p> <p>\"Well, you know, sometimes fear does the work of reason,\" he says. \"I feel we're making good progress at a pace I think is appropriate, and I hope I've been more successful in infusing a more questioning and challenging attitude with respect to every aspect of the university's traditions ... It's very important that everybody, everywhere here be questioning what they do and that we always try to be a more vigorous and more risk-taking culture.\"</p> <p>Summers, a former economics professor here, was appointed very deliberately because the governing body, the Harvard Corporation, wanted a doer, someone young (he is 50 next month) and robust enough to change it. And he is, as the Boston Globe has it, incapable of hands-off anything.</p> <p>\"More and more of what is most exciting cuts across traditional boundaries and therefore the university needs to work together more effectively, and for that reason I've been a centraliser ... The university's greatest asset is its reputation and that's the common reservoir from which all the schools draw, and therefore we all have a common interest in its maintenance. That means more common policies in some areas than we have had in the past.\"</p> <p>Not least over choosing staff, in which Summers has exercised his right to interfere more. Historian Niall Ferguson is just the latest British academic to be lured there, from New York University. \"We've moved somewhat the pattern of faculty appointments towards recruiting young people before they've done their best work, rather than a more traditional Harvard practice of recruiting the lions of the discipline after they've done their best work,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Sure there are questions and resistances of the kind that are part of any organisation. But I think there's a very good spirit here and I'm very excited.\"</p> <p>Wearing regulation light blue, buttoned-down Oxford shirt and red tie, he speaks quickly throughout our interview, with his feet up on a coffee table. He claws at a can of caffeine-free Diet Coke (the point of that drink is what, exactly?) and a cautious smile presses out from his lips from time to time to emphasise a particular point. He's thinner than you might remember him, but still on the stocky side. It's his position rather than his height that might lead him to offer sermons from on high, but Summers is not into talking as though he's the leader of the global academic enterprise.</p> <p>\"What you do has much more importance than what you say, and I think Harvard has a wonderful set of traditions that need to be closely watched in the academic world and beyond. That gives us a special responsibility to do things that are as significant and innovative as we possibly can. I think leadership in general is better practised than proclaimed.\"</p> <p>He likes speaking in lists, and in the \"practising not proclaiming\" category he mentions the extension of financial aid so no one from a family earning less than $40,000 (\u00a322,140) will have to pay to come here (though they are expected to work to repay some of their grants); work to improve the status of graduates who want to work in education; support for stem cell research; and the establishment of the Broad Institute, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to research genomics.</p> <p>\"I think Harvard is an American university and needs to remain rooted in American traditions,\" he says. \"But if America is going to be what it can be and enjoy what it has the potential to enjoy in the 21st century, I believe it has to be engaged in promoting a better world. An America that stays focused at home or an America that operates only on a narrow conception of its interest is an America that is likely to sell itself short.\"</p> <p>Some UK vice-chancellors, as they try to promote their institutions as universities for the world, talk as though their Britishness is a historical accident. Would Summers mind if, in time, most Harvard students came from abroad? \"This question of Harvard losing its connection to America is a little like the worry that I might become anorexic or too thin as a result of my diet. It's a possibility out there, but the direction of movement from here, I think, is quite clear. Any danger is somewhat remote. </p> <p>\"My hope would be that Harvard remains an American university, but a far more international and global university, and I think the opportunity to come to America is an important part of what makes the university such a magnet to foreign students and I wouldn't want to lose that.\"</p> <p>Harvard, of course, is the university that picked up Oxford reject Laura Spence, a cause celebrated by Summers' friend Gordon Brown, and the admissions office is driving hard in the UK.</p> <p>\"Certainly there's now a global market for extraordinary faculty,\" he says. \"There's a global competition for the best PhD students and there's global competition in some other fields. At the undergraduate level, while there is much more international interchange than there was a decade or two ago, we still don't have a kind of open global market competition, and I suspect that's quite some distance off.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Robert Reich, labour secretary in an earlier Clinton administration, warned in a speech to the Higher Education Policy Institute in London that US universities were in danger of losing their public purpose. Summers disagrees, but adds: \"I worry that we need to make sure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds come to American universities in greater numbers.\" That's where the free education for poorer families comes in, as well as his new Crimson summer academy, for talented students in schools at the unposh end of the neighbourhood. Summers, himself, ran a class on public speaking.</p> <p>While he is said to be sceptical about across-the-board \"affirmative action\", he reserves the right to promote ethnic minority and poorer students. \"You have to judge everybody in terms of what they bring to the table. I don't think it's a matter of compensating for disadvantage, I think it's a matter of judging potential.\" He uses the example of two applicants, one from a privileged background, the other from a disadvantaged home, who score the same on the scholastic aptitude test that most US students take. \"I think it's relatively clear that the student who has earned the high score without all the help is likely to have more potential than the other student.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the area where Summers shows most humility - not a word easily associated with his institution - is over Harvard's record on teaching, and the face time students get with leading academics. In the Shanghai Jiao Tong league table, Cambridge - the English one - beat Harvard for teaching quality. \"I know we need to work on our teaching,\" Summers says. Harvard, he maintains, has a good record compared with other US universities. But ask if Oxbridge has lessons for Harvard and he eventually concludes: \"I think that is somewhere where we have something to learn, yeah.\" Smaller classes are one of his curriculum review recommendations. He says his reforms \"will provide more, and substantially greater, inducement for faculty and students to spend time together, which there has been too little of, traditionally, at Harvard and other great American universities.</p> <p>\"I thought it was a terrific sign that for the first time, when I hosted the barbecue for the freshmen, there were more than 100 faculty members who came to greet the freshmen, which is something that is sort of unheard of ... The culture is changing, but it takes time.\"</p> <p>The phone's going in the adjoining office. He says he spends 10%-20% of his time talking to donors or would-be donors - some universities (among them Yale and Princeton) have a higher endowment per student. \"The reason to give to Harvard has never been need; it's always been opportunity.\"</p> <p>And there are big, big opportunities. I ask him what he's most excited about and he can't pick one thing. \"It's constructing the university of the 21st century at Allston. It's substantially increasing the size of the faculty, so we really can provide, not just the most cutting-edge education, but the most nuanced and direct education, with contact between teachers and students.</p> <p>\"It's the chance to make Boston to the sciences in the 21st century, what Florence was to the arts in the 14th and 15th. And it's the chance to do to professions like education and public health and government what universities did for professions like medicine, business and law in the first part of this century. I think that's something that, if we are successful, will reverberate around the world.\" His secretary comes in. And he is on to the next thing before I've stood up.</p> <p><strong>Admissions: 'we are asking how that person will contribute to society'</strong></p> <p>Harvard doesn't do admissions quotas. But it does have \"tips\" - biases, all other things being equal, towards some candidates. One is in favour of students from the greater Boston area. Another is in favour of the children of former students - 40% get in, a much higher acceptance rate than in general. \"The fact is that the substantial majority of the alumni/alumnae sons and daughters who apply will not be admitted,\" says William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid.</p> <p>There's no automatic bias in favour of low-income or ethnic minority students. But, he says: \"We know that someone might bring something a little bit different, might make for a richer educational environment because he or she comes from a certain background ... But in any individual case, just because that person checks a box doesn't mean he or she, regardless of ethnicity, will bring something distinctive.\"</p> <p>Every April, Harvard writes to 70,000 students who've done well in SATs. It also holds meetings in 70 cities. A fortnight ago Fitzsimmons went to Jacksonville, Charleston and Savannah.</p> <p>Admissions officers read each application and give it an overall score. If the candidate has a chance, it will go to one of 21 regional sub-committees. They in turn make recommendations to a standing committee, chaired by Fitzsimmons, of 20 to 25 senior administrators and (mostly) academics. It sits for two and a half weeks, often talking into the night. The committee votes on each application; a student wins a place on a majority. But in the final hours, they often have to squeeze the list further still. \"It's the whole world vying for that last space,\" says Fitzsimmons.</p> <p>There was a spike in UK applicants the year after the Laura Spence furore, but numbers are still small: 33 offers this year; 25 came. \"Our mandate is very simple: wherever there are great students, we're going to go after them,\" says Fitzsimmons, but he accepts most will stay closer to home.</p> <p>\"We are trying to look at the future, ask how that person will be at Harvard, and how that person perhaps will contribute to society later - impossible questions ... But when there are as many people working on admissions as we have, it is possible to come up with more informed assessments.</p> <p>\"The underpinning, of course, is academic strength: it would do no one any good to bring someone here who would struggle academically. But there are some judgment calls there.\"</p> <p><strong>Fundraising: 'people know it will have impact'</strong></p> <p>Harvard invites its alumni back for a dinner every five years. Last year it held a 25th anniversary dinner for the class of 1978. The reunion, or rather the fundraising before and after - the college is never so vulgar as to tap people at the table - raised $30m (\u00a316.5m). The class of 1950, on its 50th anniversary, handed over $50m (\u00a327.5m) - \"50 for 50\". Three-quarters of alumni give at least every five years; 45% every year.</p> <p>Harvard has a big fundraising staff: 90 for the college alone, and 620 across the university. But a lot of the asking is done by alumni themselves. The college appoints class leaders to head a committee of up to 160 people. They hold events ahead of the reunion, on the west coast, and in New York and Boston, and between them reach virtually the whole year group of 1,400 or so. It's not unknown for 80% to turn up to the dinner.</p> <p>\"The class of 79 wants to beat the class of 78,\" says Donella Rapier, vice-president for alumni affairs and development. \"A lot of people are really energised by the competition. Some people are turned off, but it's actually pretty effective.\"</p> <p>In 2003-4, Harvard raised $541m (\u00a3300m). But it is actually going through a \"quiet period\" before the launch of a major campaign in 2007 or 2008. \"You hope to have 30%, 40%, sometimes even 50% of the money raised before you publicly launch,\" says Rapier.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of things we do for alumni that we would do whether we raised money or not,\" she says. It's a \"happy by-product\" that this leads them to feel they want to \"participate financially\".</p> <p>\"They know if they make an investment at Harvard it will be managed well, spent and stewarded well, and it will have impact. People know a place like Harvard is going to last. So if they want to create something that is going to last for generations, this is a good place to do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>A judge in Milan will today begin the first criminal proceedings to be triggered by the Parmalat scandal when he opens a hearing to decide on calls for the indictment of 32 individuals and institutions including the group's founder and former chairman, Calisto Tanzi.</p> <p>The global food conglomerate's devastating \u20ac14bn (\u00a39.65bn) implosion at the end of last year was the result of one of the world's largest financial deceptions. A vast network of offshore subsidiaries covered up debts eventually totalling eight times those shown on Parmalat's balance sheet.</p> <p>The scandal raised fears about corporate governance in Europe comparable to the worries prompted by the failure of Enron in the United States. It also revived speculation that investors in Italian companies courted special risks.</p> <p>So great is the interest in the proceedings that they are to be relayed to screens outside the court. Tens of thousands of Italian bond and shareholders saw the value of their investments slashed by Parmalat's near-collapse.</p> <p>Prosecutors will strive to convince the judge that they have a solid case against Mr Tanzi and 28 other Parmalat directors, executives and advisers. They are also seeking the arraignment of the Italian units of the firm's accountants, Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton, and the Italian subsidiary of Bank of America, which was closely involved in Parmalat's financing.</p> <p>Bank of America, Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton's former Italian unit have all denied wrongdoing.</p> <p>In separate civil actions, the company's administrator, Enrico Bondi, is trying to get back cash from international institutions he blames for underpinning the group's fantasy accounting. Several banks helped with - and profited from - a stream of bond issues that kept Parmalat afloat until last December.</p> <p>The hearing that begins today is expected to last several months. The accused have been charged with a variety of financial offences including market manipulation.</p> <p>Among those at risk of indictment is Fausto Tonna, Parmalat's former chief financial officer. In an interview at the weekend, he strove to heap the blame for the company's downfall on to its founder.</p> <p>He painted a picture of a chairman who simply ignored repeated shortfalls between predicted and actual earnings.</p> <p>\"For a decade, we went on drawing up budgets [on the basis of] forecast growth of 35 to 40% when sales were way below that,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Lots of times, I warned the boss, but he would shrug. That's how he behaved when faced with bad news.\"</p> <p>The former CFO also accused Mr Tanzi of keeping on incompetent executives despite their failure to meet the profit targets on which Parmalat's spending was based. His own department was \"forced by Calisto Tanzi to cover [the] losses,\" he added.</p> <p>In separate actions, Parmalat's new managers are suing Deloitte &amp; Touche and Grant Thornton for $10bn (\u00a35.5bn) and seeking a further $10bn from banks including Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston.</p> <p>But financial institutions affected by the scandal have claimed they too were fooled by the vast fraud perpetrated at Parmalat. It came to light last December when Bank of America denied it was holding \u20ac4bn which the group claimed to have deposited with it.</p> <p>Today's hearing opens against a background of reports that prosecutors in Parma, near where the company is based, are investigating claims it paid \u20ac2m a year to political parties. The newspaper La Repubblica said at the weekend that it was not yet clear if the donations had been declared.</p>",

  "<p>It took 20 minutes for Michael Owen to get a touch of the ball in the Bernab\u00e9u stadium on Sunday night, which was bad enough. What happened in the next half-hour confirmed the worst fears of those who believe that his decision to join Real Madrid this summer was the worst of his short life. Two months before his 25th birthday, Owen's once-glittering career is in crisis. </p> <p>As he prepares to join up with the rest of the England squad in Manchester today, he will be hoping that Sven-Goran Eriksson shows faith by picking him for Saturday's qualifying match against Wales. His record of 27 goals in 63 international appearances would certainly support such a decision. But to favour him over Jermain Defoe as Wayne Rooney's partner at Old Trafford, Eriksson will have to ignore the evidence of the season so far. </p> <p>Owen's face as he left the pitch early in the second half on Sunday was as devoid of expression as he could make it. Withdrawn after distinguishing himself only by missing a couple of chances, he masked his feelings as seven weeks of intensifying disappointment reached an unhappy climax. A series of protective smokescreens helped only those seeking metaphors for the striker's struggle to come to terms with his demanding new environment. </p> <p>After removing Owen from the action, Madrid's new coach let it be known that the player had been suffering from a \"slight muscle strain\". Since Owen had shown no sign of injury but had been performing very poorly, many observers doubted Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n's claim. It seemed more likely that the excuse had been concocted first to salve the player's injured pride and second to deflect the questions of a club president who would certainly want a reason for the premature withdrawal of an \u00a38m signing. </p> <p>Owen is clearly in trouble, and it seemed a thoughtful gesture on the part of Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Liverpool's new manager, to hint that he would be welcome to return to Anfield in the event of a failure to establish himself in Madrid. But it was Ben\u00edtez whose decision sent him off in the direction of the Bernab\u00e9u in the first place, at a time when Owen and his representatives were on the brink of agreeing the final elements of a contract that would keep him at a club with which he had been associated since the age of 11. </p> <p>When Ben\u00edtez arrived and made it clear that Owen was superfluous to his requirements, Liverpool's board began negotiations with Real Madrid. Realising that he no longer had a future at Anfield, Owen found an acceptable alternative in the prospect of a transfer to the club with nine European Cups in the trophy cabinet. It was a move he might have wanted to make anyway, but probably not for another couple of years, when his small daughter - born 18 months ago - was a little older. But events dictated that he was going to have to go somewhere, and Real Madrid do not come waving an offer every day of the week. </p> <p>As Sunday night's match confirmed, however, he could hardly have arrived at the Bernab\u00e9u at a worse time. Going down to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of struggling Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a, thereby sinking to 10th place in La Liga, Madrid looked like the side who so fecklessly threw away last season's championship. Despite two changes of coach since that debacle, despite the presence on Sunday of Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, Luis Figo, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Ra\u00fal, they were once again uncoordinated in defence, incoherent in midfield and totally lacking in sparkle up front. </p> <p>Partnering Ra\u00fal in attack for the first time in the absence of Ronaldo, Owen immediately took up his familiar position on the shoulder of the last defender, ready to sprint on to a through-pass. For 20 minutes he waited in vain for such an opportunity to come. In the 21st minute his frustration led him to chase back and attempt an interception in the centre circle. </p> <p>His second touch of the ball came five minutes later, when he tried to turn his marker near the left-hand corner flag but ran the ball out of play. Again there was nothing until, on the half-hour, he tamely directed two cushioned headers back towards midfield colleagues. </p> <p>After 32 minutes he chased Walter Samuel's long ball down the inside-left channel but was given offside. Two minutes later, as he sprinted on to Figo's similar pass, the flag went up again. This was already a nightmare, but worse was to follow. </p> <p>With 36 minutes gone, Ra\u00fal rose bravely at the far post to meet Figo's long diagonal cross from the right and directed a header back across goal. Eight yards out and unmarked, Owen chested the ball down. As it bounced up, he swung his right foot to catch it high on the volley. A cheer died in tens of thousands of throats as the ball screamed past the left-hand post. </p> <p>No one minds a striker going missing for long stretches of time as long as he uses his specialist skills to make the most of the opportunities that do come along. At that moment the look of dazed unhappiness on Owen's face resembled his expression after he missed a clear chance when put through by Zidane against Numancia three weeks earlier, soon after coming on to make his home debut. Had he taken the chance, the look said, everything would have been very different. </p> <p>Owen tends to spurn chances in pairs these days. That was what happened in his 20 minutes against Numancia, and it happened again on Sunday. He had played another three insignificant passes when, a minute before the interval, he failed to make real contact with a diagonal ball that lanced through La Coru\u00f1a's defence and reached him as he stood near the penalty spot. It was his last touch of the match. He came out for the second half, but six minutes after the restart the board went up bearing his number. </p> <p>Having apparently fallen to fifth in the pecking order among Madrid's strikers, he had been an unexpected choice to start the match. This was his big chance, against a team making their worst start to the league season in many years, and it turned out to be a match in which Real desperately needed a goal to salvage not just the result but their self-respect. </p> <p>On Sunday he slipped past waiting reporters without a word, reinforcing an impression of shyness which is not helping him to win over the Spanish media, who see him as a rather disconsolate figure. </p> <p>As well as a long-term loss of form, it may be that Owen is suffering from the symptoms of being uprooted from the warmth of his close-knit family. He was still in his teens when he built his own house on a new development near the home in Flintshire where he grew up. Before his own place was finished, he also bought adjacent houses for his parents, his brother and his two sisters. </p> <p>Now he and his fiance, Louise Bonsall, and their daughter, Gemma, are living in a Madrid hotel while looking for somewhere permanent. Despite attending two or three lessons a week, Owen's Spanish is still not good enough to enable him to attempt even the slightest exchange with journalists; in that respect he is some way behind Jonathan Woodgate, Madrid's other English newcomer. </p> <p>Although his playing experience makes him a veteran, he is still only 24 years old. And suddenly he is facing the problem that sooner or later confronts all prodigies who find they can no longer live on instinct alone. </p> <p>\"Michael's been a child star for too long,\" someone close to him said yesterday. \"Now it's time for him to grow up.\" </p> <p>Part of the process of growing up may involve fighting his way past the feeling of disorientation in his new environment. And perhaps finding himself, for the first time in Eriksson's tenure, no longer England's undisputed No1 striker. </p> <p><strong>Owen v Deportivo: 52 toothless minutes</strong></p> <p><strong> 1-20min</strong> Does not have single touch of the ball. </p> <p><strong> 21min </strong> Attempts interception in the centre circle. </p> <p><strong> 25min </strong> Tries to beat defender near corner flag but ball runs out for goal kick. </p> <p><strong> 30min </strong> Two consecutive cushioned headers back to midfield colleagues. </p> <p><strong> 32min</strong> Offside when running on to Walter Samuel's long ball. </p> <p><strong> 34min</strong> Offside when running on to Luis Figo's pass. </p> <p><strong> 36min </strong> Missed chance: volleys wide of the post from Ra\u00fal's header. </p> <p><strong> 39min</strong> Short pass fails to reach Zin\u00e9dine Zidane. </p> <p><strong> 40min</strong> Touches ball back to Michel Salgado. </p> <p><strong> 44min</strong> Stabs ball back to Salgado. </p> <p><strong> 45min</strong> Missed chance: near penalty spot, fails to make contact with diagonal pass. </p> <p><strong> 52min</strong> Replaced by Fernando Morientes after apparently suffering a 'slight muscle strain'.</p>"
