  "In his salad days, when up at Oxford, Boris Johnson took it upon himself to put on a play loosely based on the scribblings of the Roman historian Suetonius. Only, a typical Johnson wheeze this, the youthful classicist decided to give the venerable work a Dadaist slant, producing a culture clash that bitterly divided his three-strong audience. <p>But, then, Johnson, editor of the Spectator and Tory shadow minister, has always revelled in such collisions, no more so than when they conspire around himself. Despite his plummy sounding old Etonian vowels and his deep suspicion of much of popular culture, Johnson has been embraced into the bosom of a normally cynical British public thanks to his stellar performances on Have I Got News For You. </p> <p>He is the bicycling commuter whose addiction to fast driving may soon cost him his licence and who, despite his true blue roots, lives in the New Labour spiritual heartland of Islington. </p> <p>He is the political fool whose talent for self deprecation seems to become ever more acute the further his career advances. (Following an interview with the New York Times the heavyweight paper dispatched a photographer to take a portrait of Johnson, only for him to send a Spectator colleague to be snapped in his place. It was only after some serious strong arming from Kimberly Fortier, Johnson's boss at the magazine, that a protesting Boris was forced in front of the camera.) </p> <p>And now he looks set to become another contradiction: a politician capable of producing a truly comic novel. Next month we get Seventy Two Virgins, Johnson's first work of fiction which is being eagerly talked up in the book trade thanks in part to his two earlier works of non fiction, Friends, Voters, Countrymen and Lend Me Your Ears . </p> <p>Those who have read the novel say its typical Johnson: bathetic, rumbustious and giving the impression it was written at breakneck speed after several long lunches. A typical paragraph reads: 'He knew from experience that Mrs Onyeama's chicken Kievs had an amazing effect on the digestive system. There was nothing normally delectable, but from time to time the kraken would wake, and then a globule of air would force itself up the oesophagus and press on the palate. Until he was obliged to let it go.' </p> <p>The novel's outlandish plot centres on a bumbling, bicycling MP who unwittingly stumbles into the world of global terrorism, but the real-life inspiration for such a character is nowhere near as shambolic. 'Shrewd' and 'sharp' are adjectives friends use to describe Johnson. 'Calculating' say opponents. </p> <p>'Boris was always somebody who people recognised as having huge ability,' recalls Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor, a contemporary at Oxford. 'But what has surprised many is the way Boris has turned himself more and more into a caricature.' </p> <p>Johnson clearly loves to play up the image that has served him so well, describing himself as a 'slowly masticating panda'. But the truth is Johnson is really a hippo. There may be big yawns on top but underneath the water he is paddling furiously to keep up with the big beasts. </p> <p>Last week the hippo bared its teeth, backing a campaign to impeach the Prime Minister on the grounds he mislead the public over the Iraq war. Johnson was conspicuous by the fact he was one of only two Tories to lend their names to the campaign. </p> <p>'Boris is not afraid to stick his head above the parapet. He's a decent human being who sometimes finds it difficult to stay inside one party,' says Rod Liddle, a regular columnist on the Spectator . </p> <p>Conventional wisdom has it that Johnson may also find it difficult to juggle his positions in the dialectical worlds of journalism and politics. But Johnson is well versed in rebutting the claim. He is fond of namechecking Disraeli and Churchill (as he does in a glowing profile in the latest Vanity Fair ) as examples of politicians who have effectively balanced the dark arts with hackery. </p> <p>But, then, these eminent statesmen didn't have to match Johnson's diverse output. In addition to his books Johnson writes a weekly column for the Daily Telegraph, and a monthly one for GQ where he is motoring correspondent. And then there is the Spectator, currently in rude health. </p> <p>'The credit for the rise in circulation is down to Boris and Boris alone,' Liddle says. 'He's been its best editor for ages. He's made it more idiosyncratic which is exactly the right thing to do at a time when the Conservative Party is weakish.' </p> <p>Rumour has it Conrad Black, the magazine's former owner, was so delighted with Johnson's performance he offered him the editorship of the Spectator 's newspaper stablemate, the Daily Telegraph - on condition he renounced his political ambitions. It would have made Johnson a powerful man, but his political ambitions exceed his journalistic ones. As a former colleague remarked: 'He is just like any other politician or journalist: vain, sentimental and ambitious. Boris wants to go all the way to the top.' </p> <p>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York on 19 June 1964, his birthplace due to the fact his father, Stanley, worked at the United Nations headquarters in the city. Johnson's mother, Charlotte, was an artist and, thanks to his parents' peripatetic lifestyle, the young Boris spent his formative years at a school in Brussels. </p> <p>After graduating from Balliol College, Johnson joined management consultants LEK. He lasted a week. There followed a spell on the Times where Johnson failed to distinguish himself, on one occasion inventing a quote from an uncle who complained to the paper with the result his nephew left Rupert Murdoch's employ soon after. </p> <p>As the Telegraph 's Europe correspondent in the 1980s, Johnson made a name for himself with tales of heroic incompetence by Brussels bureaucrats. By 1995, Johnson was an assistant editor. Four years later he was handed the keys to the Spectator, following such right-leaning luminaries as Nigel Lawson and his son, Dominic, now Sunday Telegraph editor. </p> <p>A year after assuming the Spectator hot seat, Johnson's political aspirations were crystallised when he was elected MP for the safe Tory seat of Henley. Prior to this he had contested the unwinnable seat of Clwyd South, going as far as to learn some Welsh to impress the electorate. 'Turned out it was the only part of Wales where nobody speaks Welsh. Bit of a faux-pas,' Johnson recalled. </p> <p>Surveying his wondrous rise, the temptation to turn Johnson into a William Boot of the twenty-first century, a naive, richly comic hero whose good fortune is the result of unintended consequences, is almost too delicious. But Johnson's life reads more Brideshead Revisited than Scoop . </p> <p>At Oxford he was part of a gilded circle whose privileged trajectory was never far from tragedy. Close friends included Charles Spencer, now Viscount Althrop and brother of Diana; Olivia Channon, the government minister's daughter who was to die of a drugs overdose; and Darius Guppy who was convicted of masterminding a \u00a31.8 million insurance scam involving a staged gem heist. </p> <p>Guppy's relationship with Johnson has earned the latter some unwelcome press. While in prison Guppy was taped asking Johnson to help him get the address of a reporter. Guppy wanted the hack, who was investigating him, beaten up. A worried sounding Johnson is heard on the tape saying: 'OK, Darrie, I said I'll do it and I'll do it.' Johnson never went through with the plan and friends say it was merely the action of a friend trying to placate a desperate soul. Nevertheless, when the tape was aired on Have I Got News For You , Johnson's haphazard halo momentarily lost its shine. </p> <p>That it glows greater now than ever is thanks to Johnson's industrious transformation from jobbing hack to comic institution, capable of raising smiles from political supporters of all hues. How many other politicians boast their own online fanzine? </p> <p>His charm is manifest at Spectator parties where a glass of bubbly is never far from his hand. 'He's an immense flirt, there's always a gaggle of women chasing him,' says a regular guest. Gossip columns have taken to speculating on Johnson's love life but friends say he is happily married to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer with whom he has four children. A first marriage to socialite Allegra Mostyn-Owen lasted less than a year. </p> <p>Although most of his success is down to stupendous amounts of hard work, timing has also played a part. A Tory party in the doldrums desperately needs some colour and Johnson, as its vice-chairman, is much in demand at constituency fundraisers across the shires. </p> <p>Earlier this year he was rewarded with the position of shadow arts minister, a promotion that saw him unveil a six point plan for the arts, including the convening of a summit so that Damien Hirst could explain the point of the 'Saatchi mob' and the creation of an 'indistinguishable replica' of the Elgin marbles to restore relations with Greece. </p> <p>The hare-brained manifesto made for good copy, but such actions are risky according to Taylor: 'Characters may work in the media but they can only get so far in politics. Just ask Tony Banks.' </p> <p>It is a view echoed by those in the Conservative Party. Michael Portillo, a man who knows a thing or two about career decisions, once told Johnson to choose between politics and comedy. History has yet to record Johnson's response. </p> <p><b>BORIS JOHNSON</b><br> </p> <p><b> DoB:</b> 19 June 1964, New York </p> <p><b> Jobs:</b> Editor of the Spectator , newspaper and magazine columnist, MP, author </p> <p><b> Books:</b> Seventy Two Virgins ; Friends, Voters, Countrymen ; Lend Me Your Ears </p> <p><b> Family:</b> Married Marina Wheeler in 1993 (two sons, two daughters)</p>",
  "<p>At the turn of the year the FTSE stood at about 4500. Today it stands at 4420. The FTSE banking sector, a major component of the FTSE, fell 3.2 per cent between those dates. The banking, drug and telecom sectors make up about 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 and all sectors have been disappointing this year - hence UK stocks have trodden water all year. </p> <p>There is little doubt that UK banks, though very well run, are now behind the curve in terms of global influence and size in comparison to the titanic operations created by the M&amp;A activity that has taken place between Bank of America/FleetBoston, JP Morgan Chase/BankOne and Tokyo Mitsubishi/UFJ Holdings. However, the main reason given for the declining share prices of UK major banks has been the threat of rising interest rates, which increases the level of bad debts. </p> <p>This must be the first time in living memory that the banking sector has been perceived by analysts as not increasing its profitability on a pro rata basis. With higher rates of interest, margins always increase. </p> <p>It is generally felt that there are too many banks in the UK and some of them perform only a domestic role. In the long term, without being disrespectful, the likes of Alliance &amp; Leicester, Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley do not play a leading role in banking society. But they represent serious 'add-on' value to those banking titans looking to expand their distribution networks.

  "<p>Europe must dismantle its lavish system of subsidies for sugar farmers, or face the threat of punitive trade sanctions, the World Trade Organisation is expected to rule this week.</p> <p>As Peter Mandelson prepares to take over his new brief as Europe's trade commissioner, the WTO is poised to confirm a preliminary ruling made in early August that the \u00a33-billion-a-year sugar regime breaks the rules of global trade. </p> <p>Europe's shoppers pay three times the global market price for their sugar, and quotas and tariffs prevent some of the world's poorest countries from selling their more cheaply produced sugar into the EU. Brazil, which brought the case against the EU, claims that Europe also dumps its excess sugar on world markets, depressing prices. </p> <p>Oxfam, which has conducted a long-running campaign against sugar subsidies, calculates that for every \u00a31 in aid Europe hands to poverty-stricken Mozambique, the African state is deprived of a further \u00a33 by losing out on access to the EU sugar market. Most of the winners, meanwhile, are large sugar-beet farmers in East Anglia and around Paris, and Europe's big corporate sugar processors. </p> <p>Brussels will be given the right to appeal against the ruling before the WTO allows the plaintiffs to impose sanctions, but trade campaigners are challenging Mandelson to kick off his tenure by persuading his fellow commissioners to accept defeat and begin cutting subsidies immediately.</p>",
  "<p> <strong>That'll Teach 'Em </strong>C4</p> <p><strong>A Year at Kew </strong> BBC2</p> <p><strong>NY-LON </strong>C4</p> <p><strong>Superhomes</strong> BBC2</p> <p><strong>The Olympics</strong> BBC1, BBC2</p> <p>According to the bunch of underachieving 16-year olds who have been transported back to a 1964-style secondary modern in Channel 4's <strong>That'll Teach 'Em</strong>, PE is the 'most bunked-off lesson' in their modern schools. At the 2008 games in Beijing we will therefore be fielding a GB team made up of wannabe-Jordans (and that's not Michael) as well as some footballers who can't actually play any football but know how to score. None of them will be able to spell the word 'tongue', either, but oddly all of them will know exactly what to do with one.</p> <p>I am alternately entertained and horrified by the gobby, barely literate, endlessly whingeing collection of hormones that make-up the That'll Teach 'Em experiment. Hugely entertained mostly because I recognise my 16-year-old self in every stroppy, swaggering, selfdramatising, backchatting minx who crumples in a sobbing heap clutching her teddy the minute she gets a letter from home - and horrified by their ignorance. Last week, we watched them failing to identify Scotland and London on a map of the British Isles - but it's not always their fault they're so dim; sometimes they've just been taught that way.</p> <p>At Hope Green school, all eyes and cameras are on cute-as-a-button blonde Stevie, the aspirant model. 'She wants a boob job,' laughs her mother in much the same indulgent tone that might once have been used to say 'she wants a Cabbage Patch Doll'. Despite this and needing three tries at the blackboard in order to spell 'remember' ('The English at my school is much more funner than the English here because I think it's much more harder here and I thought I was really good at it when I was at my other school but now I'm here I think I'm going to do really bad...'), Stevie has been made head girl.</p> <p>The boys, on the other hand, are rather sweet, notably head boy, Perry, currently in dizzy thrall to his opposite number's charms. They may swear too much or, as the amusing 'Scoutmaster' Mr Vince observed, deploy 'a ridiculous south London patois', but the boys are also enthusiastically embracing a more hands-on approach to learning, deftly changing car wheels and milking goats. The girls, meanwhile, are jealous of the boys for 'having fun', but also fail to consider practical skills such as typing, cooking and sewing as anything other than demeaning. 'We've learnt never to clean again,' muttered one, sulkily, at the end of her domestic studies class - silly girl: how does she think Kim and Aggie got to have a hit TV show and lucrative reinvented careers?</p> <p>In a week when the media has been bursting with reports of boys underachieving in their GCSEs, it's impossible not to watch That'll Teach 'Em and see the obvious benefits of a bit of woodwork and car maintenance. Teenage boys like doing stuff, if they're given stuff to do, and, occasionally, when they're not busy obsessing over Justin Timberlake, some girls quite like doing stuff as well - as long as they can do it as well as, or, ideally, even better, than the boys.</p> <p>More evidence of this came during the BBC's delightful new plant-porn series, <strong>A Year at Kew</strong>, in which narrator Alan Titchmarsh revealed that when he was a student at the School of Horticulture 'everyone wanted to get a placement on the tree gang', more formally known as the Arboricultural Unit, with 14,000 charges.</p> <p>The Tree Gang get to climb and occasionally wield chainsaws and it does look like great fun. The head of tree-felling is a charming man named John, who admitted that 'getting a job here is like carrying on my childhood'. Big and butch but entirely in touch with his feminine side, John was clearly the newest of New Men, shedding a tear after felling one large sick specimen (make that 13,999 trees, then) and observing that 'a lot of people come and hug the trees... they say you can hear the sap rising. Actually I'm a bit of a tree-hugger myself.'</p> <p>Elsewhere inside Kew's awesomely lovely 300 acres, Emma Fox, the youngestever keeper of the Palm House, looked just like Sigourney Weaver in Alien as she aimed a modified leafblower loaded with fungal spores at her 'babies', while the team charged with building a human-sized badger's sett for the Go Wild festival struggled with their digging deadline. Perhaps they should have employed some badgers?</p> <p>I was at Kew - one of my favourite places on earth ever since the days when it cost one old penny to get in - for a whole Saturday recently, and the only way I could persuade my son to get out of the giant badger sett (very Narnia) was by telling him that we were going to 'climb' a giant redwood in the Treetop Walk. It was hard to say which of us was enjoying all of this the most, but by lunch time we had both fallen asleep in the shade of the willow, halfway through what turned out to be a magical day. The BBC crew was at Kew that day, too, which, by my reckoning, means (hooray) there's already a second series of filming under way. I won't miss it.</p> <p>I'm not sure how clever it is to start a new seven-part drama in the middle of August, but Channel 4 has seen fit to do it with the pacy modern transatlantic love story, <strong>NY-LON</strong>, which, after just one episode, I don't want to be missing either.</p> <p>Plot? Boy meets girl in London, boy loses girl, girl finds dead body, boy flies to find girl in New York, boy flies home without girl and, next week, boy's casual girlfriend announces she's pregnant. Whatever, just sit back and enjoy.</p> <p>Beneath NY-LON's veneer of modish but potentially irritating gimmickry (split screens and ticking timecodes, flashbacks and forwards, \u00e0 la 24) there lurks a traditionalist heart - sharp writing, smart editing and some lovely shotmaking - which should mean that the series' fanbase stretches all the way from the sort of teenagers who can't locate the US on a globe, much less Manhattan, to those members of the Titchmarsh treehugging generation who enjoy a drama that isn't afraid to wear its brain as well as its heart on its sleeve.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the two scrumptious leads - Stephen Moyer (persuasively vile in the gang-rape drama Men Only) and Rashida Jones (beguiling daughter of Quincy) - are, aside from BBC news anchor Fiona Bruce and weatherman Alex Deakin, the most attractive couple you'll find on the box at 10pm on this or probably any other Tuesday.</p> <p>BBC2's highly compulsive international posh-property series <strong>Superhomes</strong> signed off last week and it was a jawdropper. The upscale property market in Moscow may be in its infancy but demand currently far outstrips supply. For the New Russians a multimillion-dollar cash deal (there are no mortgages) on their house is just part of a lifestyle that includes posses of bodyguards whispering into their cuffs and a kalashnikov on the gilded occasional table.</p> <p>Just 10 years ago Vladimir Bryntsalov was the manager of a small state-owned factory, and is now a pharmaceuticals billionaire whose main family home (he has several) is disguised to look like a science lab inside his factory compound. You couldn't have made it up, unless you were Ian Fleming. Bryntsalov generously invited the BBC inside his insanely ugly home, with rooms leading off a full-size indoor tennis-cum-basketball court, showed us his closet (a $25,000 alpaca coat) and introduced us to his young son, Alex, who explained that dad has taught him to 'earn money, keep money and spend money'.</p> <p>But it was Mr B's vulgar and ostentatious beyond-all belief country house, with its 5,000 sq metres of gold leaf and reproduction 'classic' portraits of the family (the Saddam Hussein school of interior decoration) that made me knock over my glass of Sauvignon. This was less 'Wow' than 'How-The-Hell...?', not to mention 'How Much?' Actually, Mr B's had enough of it already - it's yours for 50 million bucks. Cash, of course.</p> <p>But though the image of Mr B's master bedroom suite has seared itself into my cerebral cortex for all time, perhaps the most intriguing image of the week (in a week of extraordinary Olympic images, from the wilting, weeping, disoriented Paula Radcliffe to the triumphant, if disbelieving, Kelly Holmes) came when Brendan Foster told us that, after the 800m, Holmes had her running shoes removed in the changing room by Lord Coe. Is that profoundly sweet and moving, or a great incentive for teenagers to carry on bunking-off PE? Whichever, I can't stop thinking about it - and nor, I suspect, can Kelly.</p>",
  "<p>If Alex McLeish is to develop a taste for blood, he would rather it came from inflicting wounds on opponents than from licking his own. At the moment, however, the Rangers manager's prospects for wish-fulfilment are not exactly brimming with promise. </p> <p>The Ibrox side's failure to qualify for the group stage of the Champions League as a consequence of last Wednesday's lifeless performance against CSKA Moscow - beaten 3-2 on aggregate after the 1-1 draw at home - has surely left them seriously damaged, both financially and psychologically. The lost booty from Europe's most lucrative tournament is irrecoverable, but the other scars would heal, miraculously, in the course of 90 minutes were McLeish's players to achieve victory in the first Old Firm match of the season at Celtic Park this afternoon.</p> <p>Even the majority of their most committed followers, however, are convinced that such a cure could be effected only by divine intervention, or by accident. The despondency that has eddied around Ibrox in the past few days will deepen into despair if they do not avoid a seventh successive league defeat at the hands of their fiercest rivals. The figures - embracing all four meetings last season and the final two of 2002-03 - are depressing enough, but Rangers supporters are further distressed by the comprehensive manner of each of those reversals and by the vain search for encouragement within them. </p> <p>Working within a budget stiflingly constricted by Rangers' enormous debt, McLeish had to overhaul last season's fatally fragile squad simply for the sake of it. Having trailed Celtic by 17 points at the end of the championship and having also been eliminated from the Tennents Scottish Cup by Martin O'Neill's marauding champions, it was clear that the gap between the two would have remained unbridgeable without extensive changes. </p> <p>Those who have scrutinised the restructured team for reassuring portents since the start of the season have yet to be convinced. If anything, there is already a groundswell of conviction that Rangers have made no progress. That is a severe judgment, considering how early in the new campaign it has been made. But it is also understandable. The scoreless draw at Aberdeen on the opening day of the league programme suggested a potentially crippling vulnerability in Rangers' midfield, an impression that was firmed up during the match with the Russians in midweek. </p> <p>In an attempt to match Celtic's power in that crucial area, McLeish recruited the veteran Alex Rae from Wolves. Rae has a naturally combative style, but an obvious lack of guile and verve may explain why he has spent most of his career among middle-to-lower order clubs in England. Four weeks short of his thirty-fifth birthday, it is unlikely, too, that he will suddenly acquire the skill and inventiveness to transform Rangers. Rae missed the European match because of suspension, but seems certain to return today. His deputy against CSKA, the Serbian Dragan Mladenovic, was predictably short of sharpness and stamina as a result injury-enforced inactivity in recent weeks. Whether he is yet ready for the peculiar rigours of this occasion is surely debatable. </p> <p>With the likelihood of O'Neill introducing Juninho into his midfield beside Stilian Petrov, Neil Lennon and Alan Thompson, it is hardly surprising that Celtic should be odds-on to maintain the general superiority they have enjoyed since the arrival of the Irishman four years ago. O'Neill made some cautionary noises about Juninho's lack of match fitness - having played only for Middlesbrough's reserves before his acquisition by Celtic last Wednesday - and about the need to assess any new player's assimilation into a new environment, but it will be surprising if he does not put the little Brazilian World Cup winner straight into the mix. Circumstances have clearly conspired to put McLeish under extreme pressure, although widespread talk of the precariousness of his position in the event of defeat by Celtic is simply gossip-mongering. </p> <p>Even so, he is significantly ready to agree in public - an unmissable exercise in self-protection - that Rangers' finances have ensured that he has not been dealt a fair hand. 'CSKA spent twenty-odd million on five or six new players, so in that respect, they had an advantage over us,' said McLeish, in response to questions about the European disappointment. Asked if the job has become progressively more difficult as the budget has shrunk, he replied: 'I think that's a fact, there's no doubt about that. </p> <p>'The cake has got a bit smaller so it does make it a hard job. But David Murray [the club's owner] and Martin Bain [director of football operations] are totally aware of that. But expectations here never change. There's no question that, given the present financial situation, European expectations at least have been too high.' Celtic's status as odds-on favourites never impresses O'Neill, whose wariness on the eve of these confrontations is as inevitable as his cavorting around the dug-out while they are in progress. 'Honestly, I don't see it as a natural continuation of our good recent record. </p> <p>'I just see it as a new season and so it is different and the challenge from Rangers will be tough. My view would be the same even if it were the same two teams from last season playing each other. These games are always a trial. The moment the final whistle is blown and you're actually in front is the only moment you really enjoy. I'm not even sure I enjoy any of the matches.' </p> <p><em>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>What an exciting long weekend we are enjoying and we had better make the most of it as there is a long wait until the next time. I refer, of course, to all the transfer gossip, speculation and perhaps even some movement, with one young man dominating the market. Rain on Bank Holiday? When it comes to Wayne, there is unlikely to be a holiday for Manchester United's bank. </p> <p>The deadline day for Premiership transfers is Tuesday and the next window of opportunity does not open again until January. Thus does the last weekend of the summer sales provide a feverish opportunity for dealing. And it seems certain to be the last weekend of Wayne Rooney as an Everton player. Or does it? Having now asked for a transfer, Rooney might well move to Old Trafford this week but the sense here is that United do not actually want him yet. </p> <p>They would have preferred Rooney to get himself fit again, play half a season at Goodison Park, then recruit a more effective player in the New Year to bring impetus for the push for honours in the second half of the season. And at a time when their cash flow is better. Newcastle United, however, raised the stakes by making an initial offer of \u00a320 million, since raised to \u00a325m. It made little sense, most agree, with Alan Shearer, Craig Bellamy, Patrick Kluivert and Shola Ameobi already at the club. Bellamy, a garrulous member of a dressing room that grows more talkative after the chairman Freddie Shepherd's self-destructive statement that this is Sir Bobby Robson's last season as manager, helpfully pointed out as much. </p> <p>Conspiracy theories abound, though. By making what might be close to an acceptable bid, Newcastle forced United into the race. By upping the offer, they invited United to top them, meaning that if United did buy, then they may also have had to sell, with Newcastle just waiting then to offer a good sum for John O'Shea, a defender being the priority after the sale of Jonathan Woodgate to Real Madrid. Then again, Newcastle may want Rooney to fill Shearer's boots. There is word that Southampton want Shearer as player/manager and it could suit Newcastle. This is likely to be his last season as a player and they can then in the future welcome back Tyneside's favourite son after he has done his grounding, made his mistakes, elsewhere. Southampton, averaging a manager a year under Rupert Lowe with Paul Sturrock having lasted just six months, would seem to be a good venue these days for making mistakes. Not that many people do it in this game, but am I reading too much into things, giving too much credit for canniness to a sport where the politics and economics of chaos are more usual? Wait, there's more. </p> <p>The Everton chairman, Bill Kenwright, told the Goodison faithful - disillusioned, but admirably faithful - that it was to be David Moyes's choice as to whether Rooney is sold. On the surface, it would seem a supportive remark; the chairman will not sell a player under the manager's nose. Moyes, though, is said to be angry. It could have looked like he was the villain of the piece if Rooney went, the chairman blameless and powerless to keep the club's prime asset. Moyes, already under some strain even if last weekend's win at Crystal Palace eased it a little, has at least had that taken from him with Rooney's request. Actually, it could all work out well for Everton. The boardroom manoeuvres could bring some new investment to the club, although whether Moyes can spend it by Tuesday is another matter, with the Rooney money probably earmarked to pay off pressing debts. If Everton are clever - although the words Everton and clever have not gone together for some time now - they might even recruit from United. O'Shea would strengthen them and there is talk that David Bellion could be a makeweight in the Rooney deal, even if Moyes would prefer James Beattie. </p> <p>Everton do hold a strong hand, an ace at least. For that is what Rooney is. Old Trafford is looking for a touchstone player, has been since the retirement of Eric Cantona. Ronaldinho could have been the successor, but United did not recruit aggressively enough and the Brazilian chose Barcelona. While they questioned whether they could afford Rooney, the real question this time really should have been whether they could afford not to buy him. Although only 18, Rooney did show at Euro 2004 that he is not a character overawed by the big stage. Many have been overwhelmed at Old Trafford, but Alex Ferguson recalls Cantona walking into the Theatre of Dreams, sticking out his chest and saying that this was the place for him. Rooney appears to have a similar mentality. </p> <p>He has similarities as a player to Cantona, too. Strong and powerful, he also has a neat, cushioned touch. Above all, his movement is excellent, as he drops off defenders to receive the ball at the timeliest moment. At the risk of upsetting Tyneside, there could be no choice for Rooney between Newcastle and United. Passionate and loyal the fans may be in the North-East, but few young players have prospered in its singular, insular environment in the past few years. </p> <p>In Manchester, Rooney gets to be near his Liverpool roots, but with healthy distance from them. And Champions League football. For anyone interested in football's finances, Manchester United are the model. Their wage bill is less than 50 per cent of turnover - astonishingly low in comparison with badly run clubs who have even gone above 100 per cent. Even plc boards, however, must understand that football can be a business like no other. Sometimes you have to speculate to accumulate. Rooney may not have been in the budget until next January, but circumstances, like such a player becoming available, dictate in this case. When all the smoke and mirrors are cleared away and, holidays over, we settle down to four months without Premiership movement, expect Wayne Rooney to be settling in at Old Trafford. </p> <p><strong> Sturrock sacking tells cautionary tale</strong> </p> <p>With the departure from Southampton of Paul Sturrock, now only David Moyes remains in the Premiership as a manager promoted from a lower level. There are some who have plied their trade there - Alan Curbishley, Steve Bruce - but they took their clubs up. </p> <p>What hope now for the lower-division managers? The trend at the bigger clubs is to look overseas for men who can bring the best players with them - and few domestically raised managers are even in contention for the better jobs. </p> <p>It certainly worries the League Managers' Association and is yet another sign that the gap between the Premiership and the rest of English football grows ever wider. </p> <p>The ins and outs of the Sturrock sacking are difficult to discern. His was a cruelly short stay, but it seems that the Southampton players did not take to his style. Sturrock was apparently fond of recounting to them what had made Plymouth successful and they resented it. It recalls Arsenal's players being unimpressed by Bruce Rioch's tales of Bolton. </p> <p>Player power, mentioned here last week, may have reasserted itself, but, more practically, no club can retain a manager who does not have the confidence of the players. </p> <p><em>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Bill Ford is, by all accounts, a reluctant chairman and chief executive, perhaps because he embodies that great business dilemma of our age: how to make money without ruining the planet. </p> <p>Even bosses who don't care too much about the environment fear punitive fines or encroaching regulation. But Ford, the fourth generation of his family to run the eponymous car giant, really seems to care. </p> <p>Ford's website describes the keen fly fisherman as a 'nature lover'. The man himself says he is an 'industrial environmentalist'. He is also vegetarian and does yoga at the weekend - not exactly proof, but suggestive of a different attitude to many contemporaries. </p> <p>So, with the enthusiasm - some would say naivete - of a relatively youthful 41 years, Ford took over as chairman five years ago and declared that the company would distinguish itself as a great company 'by our efforts to make the world a better place'. </p> <p>But the reality of steering the business through years of losses - caused by a Firestone tyre problem and economic slowdown which led to production cuts and a fierce price war - has been harsh. </p> <p>Now Ford and his company are under attack from both sides: environmentalists jeer at broken promises and decry lobbying against tougher emissions standards; and customers, angry at support for green groups and policies they claim threaten their way of life, have boycotted its vehicles. </p> <p>The first glaring question is whether there is a fundamental conflict between running one of the world's biggest industrial production operations producing hugely polluting products which perpetuate a way of life that fundamentally threatens the environment, and trying to be 'green'. </p> <p>Not at all, says Nick Scheele, Ford's president, who argues that the company's size and activities make it all the more important that it tries to be environmentally responsible. </p> <p>'The car has done many, many things for all of us; it's probably impossible to imagine a world without personal mobility and the car gives you that. The issue that drives us is how do we secure the benefits - both personal and overall economic for society at large - while reducing and hopefully one day being able to get to a situation where we have no negative impact on the environment. </p> <p>'If we were a tiny company and said we were concerned about the environment, that would be great, but the potential impact would be [minimal] perhaps.' </p> <p>Fine words, which emphasise that what Ford is doing is critical - not just for the company, or the local community but, by its scale and potential for leadership, for the world. </p> <p>Last year, the company produced more than 6.7 million vehicles; the Rainforest Action Network protest group claims the company's products account for one month of US oil consumption each year - more than the annual total for Italy. </p> <p>Ford's environmental history dates back to its nature-loving founder, Henry Ford, who pioneered recycling techniques and tried to use renewable sources such as soya beans for paint and 'plastic' car parts. </p> <p>Modern-day Ford followed up with the first US-produced car without harmful CFCs in its air conditioning in 1992, the first natural gas car in 1997, a system to recycle paint fumes as a small-scale power source, and this summer the world's first hybrid model in the gas-guzzling sports utility vehicle range. </p> <p>Bill Ford, however, has taken over in an era when a model here and an innovation there no longer seem enough. Concern about global weather catastrophes, choking airs and poisoned land and water have taken on an apocalyptic, universal urgency which demands big actions. </p> <p>Ford responded by becoming a leader in acknowledging the controversial issue of global warming for which his industry is so often blamed. He was an early member of the UK carbon trading scheme and the Chicago Climate Exchange - voluntarily committing the company to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>'All the science is not always accepted, but there's enough data out there to know there's something going on and we need to know how to handle that,' says Sue Cischke, Ford's vice president for environmental and safety engineering. </p> <p>In practical terms, Ford's first major step was to announce he would rebuild the original famous Rouge plant near the global headquarters in Detroit as 'a model of 21st-century sustainable manufacturing'. </p> <p>There was scepticism from critics and opposition internally, but Ford hired respected experts and gave them $2 billion and a fairly free rein. The results are dramatic: the main factory is topped by the world's biggest roof garden, surrounded by vines to keep the buildings cool, porous carparks for drainage, soil and vegetation to 'clean' run-off water, and 1,500 new trees. The best - and money saving - ideas are being considered for other factories, starting in China. </p> <p>Beyond the company's plants, it has got eight out of 10 suppliers to measure up to the ISO14001 environmental standard for air and water quality, chemical handling and recycling. The remaining 20 per cent are working towards it. </p> <p>Back at Ford, the company has gone beyond emissions regulations on models including Volvos, Jaguars and the Ford Ikon in India, and has announced that more hybrids are in the pipeline. </p> <p>In its most ambitious move to date, Ford promised in 2000 that it would increase fuel efficiency for its SUVs by 25 per cent by 2005 - a pledge the other two big US auto giants, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler, promised either to match or better. </p> <p>This year, the company announced that half its research budget would be put toward improving fuel economy and, although the company won't say how much it is spending, it is putting money into all alternatives, from more fuel-efficient petrol engines to a futuristic hydrogen combustion engine. </p> <p>Recycling is another strong theme: Ford personally appointed Andy Acho to lead a programme which has seen old jeans used for sound-deadening, 50m soda bottles turned into car parts and over 8m tyres and tonnes of plastic cups, carpeting and other rubbish saved from landfill. </p> <p>All this noise and action has earned the company and the chairman plaudits but also fierce criticism for failing to meet the self-imposed high standards. And nowhere was this more dramatically played out than when they admit ted last year that they would fail to meet the SUV standard - by such a big margin that this year the company's SUVs will be only 5 per cent more fuel-efficient than when the 25 per cent target was set. </p> <p>Nor is that all Ford has been pilloried for: Bill Ford and the company have been outspoken critics of an attempt by California (which would most likely be followed by other states) to curb carbon emissions from vehicles, and by the federal government to impose tougher fuel-efficiency standards. </p> <p>And, while research continues on clean-engines research and a few hybrid vehicles, Ford continues to churn out millions of SUVs and other performance cars. </p> <p>As a result, across the whole Ford fleet in the US, fuel efficiency did rise slightly but this year is expected to drop to below the 1998 average at just 23mpg - the worst of the big auto-makers ranked by the country's Environmental Protection Agency. Over the same period, average carbon dioxide emissions from Ford cars have risen from 375g to 385g. </p> <p>This has angered critics such as the Rainforest Action Network, which last week held its latest direct action, this time over Ford's decision to withdraw its small fleet of zero emission vehicles from the US. </p> <p>'It's part of a pattern,' said RAN campaigner Jennifer Krill. 'It's not even that Ford isn't keeping the promises it makes. First of all Ford needs to get out of last place before it gains any environmental credibility.' </p> <p>Yes, Ford has done good things - like the new Rouge plant - but they are dwarfed by the emissions problem, says Krill. 'It has the largest green roof in the world, but it's not large enough to counter the emissions produced by a quarter of a million F-150 [pick-up trucks] that come out of that plant every year.' </p> <p>Other environmental groups are encouraging Ford - but warn that the company still has to prove itself. </p> <p>'They did fail to meet the 25 per cent target, and that was a disappointment, but to me that doesn't mean they have abandoned tackling the problems,' said David Friedman, research director for the clean vehicle programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists. </p> <p>'They have the technology, it's a question of will and putting marketing and money behind that.' </p> <p>Some at Ford feel they are unfairly criticised because they set higher goals. 'Because of Bill's commitment we have been a target, of course,' says Cischke. </p> <p>But the company also rejects some criticism as misguided. In particular it is adamant that the California CO2 regulation is illegal because it is dictated by fuel efficiency, which is a federal matter. In turn it claims tougher federal efficiency limits would not work as well as higher fuel prices. </p> <p>'Fuel tax is the way to go to change consumer habits,' says Scheele. 'There's no incentive in this country to change from large vehicles, with gas prices [as low as they are]: people call them [high] today but relative to the UK it's a bit of a joke.' </p> <p>In the US, there has been a national outcry over gas prices, which are still short of $2 (\u00a31.30) a gallon. </p> <p>The real key to Ford's sometimes apparently contradictory behaviour, though, is that it is struggling to reconcile ideals with the commercial reality of a fiercely competitive global industry and a capital system which rewards success today far more generously than concern about tomorrow. </p> <p>'One thing is very clear to anyone in consumer business: it's the consumer who decides,' says Scheele.</p>",
  "<p>Glenmorangie may translate as 'vale of tranquillity', but there was little peace around the Scottish village of Tain, the home of the famous whisky, after last week's announcement that the founding Macdonald family planned to sell its 52 per cent stake in the business. </p> <p>The famously secretive family has been characteristically tight-lipped about how it will handle the sale. So far, there have been no assurances about the position of the management, never mind the rest of the 400-strong workforce. </p> <p>It would certainly be unfortunate if the sale was to lead to the loss of Paul Neep, chief executive, and finance director Iain Hamilton, the duo brought in seven years ago to resuscitate a then-moribund brand. The most recent figures, showing sales growing at about twice as fast as the industry average in virtually every key market, are testament to their success in doing that. </p> <p>And it is not just Glenmorangie, which is now the number one malt in Britain; the company has also succeeded in making the rather ordinary Glen Moray the fourth-best seller, largely due to expert brand-building. On top of that, there are great hopes for Ardbeg, the Islay malt the company recently brought out of mothballs, given that whiskies from the island are currently the most sought-after among Scotch drinkers. </p> <p>Shell-shocked management is believed to have considered a buy-out, but given that the value of the business is tied up in whisky stocks - which use, rather than provide, cash - and that it could fetch upwards of \u00a3300 million, or more than 25 times earnings, venture capitalists would be unable to make the figures stack up. </p> <p>Likely buyer Brown Forman, the US company behind Jack Daniels, will doubtless be aware of the management's strength, both through their shareholdings and the marketing deals they have with Glenmorangie. Whether that will translate into keeping the team intact remains to be seen. </p> <p><strong> Why Hilton isn't shouting the odds</strong></p> <p> As this paper predicted last week, Hilton, the hotels group that owns the Ladbroke's betting business, turned in a sparkling set of first-half profits. At \u00a3190m, it beat even the most optimistic forecasts, and the City began lifting full-year estimates at once. Deutsche Bank now expects 2004 to see full-year profits of \u00a3380m. </p> <p>All very commendable - but you sensed that David Michels was just a little reluctant to blow Hilton's trumpet. And when you look behind the headline figures, you can see why. Although the hotels side benefited from the global recovery in the sector, it was gambling that really took off. </p> <p>Ladbroke's profits were up more than 50 per cent, and the 'gross win' - for Ladbroke, that is, not the punter - jumped by 26 per cent to \u00a3455m. This is mainly due to the latest craze: fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) that allow us to play virtual roulette, poker or many other games. </p> <p>Ladbroke is touchy about these FOBTs, because the company could be left open to claims that it is encouraging problem gambling, and in fact a new code of conduct on their use seems to have had some dampening effect, as Michels was quick to point out. </p> <p>Hilton rightly sees potential danger from a nanny-state government that might decide a windfall tax on the bookies would raise some cash and do nothing to harm its popularity. Shareholders should watch out for any twitches from Whitehall on this subject.</p> <p><strong> Four strikers and you're out</strong></p> <p> News that Manchester United is planning to splurge about \u00a325m on Wayne Rooney will hearten fans but should worry investors. </p> <p>The talented teenager from Everton may have been the star of England's Euro 2004 campaign, but the mooted deal is not entirely coherent. United already have three top-rated strikers; two will inevitably become expensive substitutes if Rooney joins. </p> <p>The plc's pre-tax profits were \u00a340m last year. Sir Alex Ferguson's willingness to spend more than half of this sum on Rooney brings to mind such wasteful acquisitions as Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n (\u00a328m) and arguably Rio Ferdinand (\u00a330m). Marquee signings like that were supposed to be a thing of the past, with chief executive David Gill apparently under pressure from John Magnier and JP McManus, Irish racing magnates and United's biggest shareholders, to keep an eye on the purse strings. </p> <p>The truth is, though, that football clubs will always be uniquely in thrall to their supporters, even when they are listed on the stock market. United is by a long way the best-run club in Britain, but its return on equity will probably be about 7 per cent this year, and most analysts agree that the company is overpriced at its current market value of about \u00a3670m. </p> <p>Shareholders may be holding out for a takeover bid, either from Magnier and McManus or from Malcolm Glazer, the Florida tycoon who has also built a sizeable stake. But the months have worn on, and neither side looks ready to make a decisive move. Nor is there any sign of a billionaire United fan galloping over the horizon to buy both of them out. </p> <p>Could it be that both Glazer and the Irish have found themselves sitting on over-large investments they are unable to offload?</p>",
  "<p>Last week saw one of the least auspicious days in the life of the energy market: Shell's \u00a384 million fine for falsifying its gas and oil reserve statements, price spikes for wholesale gas breaking the 50 per cent barrier, British Gas announcing the single biggest energy price rise since liberalisation, and Powergen's \u00a3700,000 fine for, wrongly, preventing consumers switching to the company of their choice. </p> <p>These events have had a ferocious impact on consumers. In 2003 a four-person family was paying on average \u00a3356 for gas and \u00a3243 for electricity. According to some estimates, if that family stays with British Gas after its price rises kick in on 20 September, they will be paying around \u00a3900 a year, \u00a3300 more. </p> <p>Market analysts have claimed that with this price rise, British Gas can afford to lose a million customers and still come out ahead. This does not look like an effective market.It bears repeating that the UK already has around 3 million people living in fuel poverty, paying more than 10 per cent of their income on energy. We also have the scandal of 23,000 older people a year living in damp, poorly heated homes, dying in the cold. </p> <p>Price rises of this magnitude will only make this worse. We may have to face the unpalatable truth that many more people will die from the cold this year because they cannot afford to heat their homes. </p> <p>From many, the reaction to this state of affairs has been an astonishing complacency. There is a mantra that the huge spikes in the cost of wholesale gas are inevitable and that UK consumers must accept, without complaint, continual hikes in price. </p> <p>Not only is this blind to the hardship that many consumers will face, it is based on flimsy evidence. </p> <p>There is no compelling explanation, let alone justification, for the sort of price rise that we have seen in the wholesale gas market. There has been no apparent change in the fundamental gas supply and demand conditions. The global price of oil, while clearly a contributory factor, is really only the most convenient explanation. Even factoring in a succession of severe winters, industry projections show no supply shortages for at least five years. </p> <p>The real problem is our colossal ignorance of what actually goes on in the far reaches of the upstream, offshore gas market. A series of investigations from Ofgem, DTI and others have failed to land a glove on the workings of the gas market. </p> <p>A market that evades any attempt to bring about greater transparency and that produces a price spike of 50 per cent in a matter of months is not a healthy market. Add to that the fact that energy is an essential service for every household and problems in the wholesale market have dramatic consequences for every single person in the country. </p> <p>We are feeling those consequences now. Consumers and businesses are being hit by double-digit price rises. The government-sponsored Fuel Poverty Advisory Group has suggested that a 10 per cent price rise across the board may mean as many as 500,000 more consumers being thrown into fuel poverty. For those already paying more than 10 per cent of their income on energy, the impact will be dreadful. </p> <p>We cannot just sit on our hands. We should not accept that ever-increasing prices are signs of a return to energy-price normality. Neither will we be able to contort national regulatory mechanisms to deal with an alien offshore environment. </p> <p>It is not acceptable that those concerned with the effective operation of energy markets, including my own organisation, can only muster a collective wringing of hands in response. </p> <p>A more decisive course of action would recognise that this is becoming a European market and requires a multi-national solution. Even with the best will in the world, Ofgem and DTI have not been able to effectively get to grips with the offshore gas market. </p> <p>This market is taking on the character of one that is beyond the powers of the usual regulatory suspects. It becomes ever more likely that the only serious avenue open to protect consumers from higher prices is an investigation by European competition authorities or the Competition Commission. </p> <p>Next month, Energywatch will play its part by bringing together some of the key players in the energy markets to face up to that fact. It is the least that consumers deserve.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Allan Asher is the chief executive of Energywatch.</p>",
  "<p>Top Merrill Lynch executives from across the globe are flying in to London to defend the firm in the high-profile sex discrimination case brought by former banker Stephanie Villalba.</p> <p>No fewer than 22 Merrill bosses are to give evidence in the case, which resumes on Tuesday after a two-month break. Villalba, who headed the investment bank's European private client business until being dismissed last year, alleges she was victimised and paid less than her male counterparts. </p> <p>Among the Merrill top brass jetting in for the showdown in the unlikely setting of Croydon employment tribunal is New York-based Winthrop Smith, former global head of private banking and a member of the firm's founding dynasty. </p> <p>Others who will give evidence include Raimundo Yu, chairman of Merrill Lynch Asia, based in Singapore; Gilles Dard, head of the bank's private client business in Paris; Juan Carlos Crespo, his counterpart in Madrid; Bruno Daher, a senior Merrill banker based in Geneva; and numerous senior executives from the firm's London office, including Ausaf Abbas, whom Villalba has accused of bullying and sexist behaviour. </p> <p>Their testimony is likely to cost Merrill Lynch a fortune in lost executive hours but is a sign of the discomfiture generated by Villalba's allegations, which garnered headlines earlier this summer. </p> <p>Villalba, who earned $550,000 in her final year at the bank, claims she was forced out after being systematically undermined by her superiors and has accused Merrill of being 'institutionally sexist'. The firm strongly denies this, saying that she was removed because of heavy financial losses in her division. </p> <p>Villalba, who has not summoned any witnesses, will be cross-examined by Nicholas Underhill, Merrill's QC, when the case resumes this week. </p> <p>A Merrill spokesman said: 'We are looking forward to challenging her allegations. We will be offering a number of witnesses to the tribunal to ensure the truth is heard.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> Madrid</strong></p> <p> Decreed the \"team of the century\" by Fifa, <strong> Real Madrid</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.realmadrid.com\">realmadrid.com</a>) are the aristocrats of world football.

The art-deco Museo Chicote (Gran Via, 12), described by Ernest Hemingway as \"without doubt the best bar in Spain\", is a good place to start, then head to Plaza Santa Ana and take your pick from hundreds of bars. The Malasa\u00f1a area attracts a younger, grungier crowd. </p> <p><strong> Extra time:</strong> Diehards will want to visit the Exposici\u00f3n de Trofeos at the Bernab\u00e9u (Tue-Sun 10.30am-7.30pm, \u20ac3.50). </p> <p>For local colour, check out the El Rastro flea market around Plaza dos Cascorro on Sunday morning.

Inter have just signed Edgar Davids and Juan Sebastian Veron in an attempt to keep up. </p> <p><strong> The big match:</strong> With both clubs effectively playing at home the <strong> AC v Inter</strong> local derbies (Oct 24 and Feb 27 2005) are electrifying, especially as the stands rise up from the pitchside - rare in a stadium as grand as this. Inter's hardcore element base themselves in the curva nord, Milan's in the curva sud. The Inter v <strong> Juventus</strong> (Nov 28) Derby d'Italia also lives up to its billing, but Milan v <strong> Juve</strong> (May 8 2005) is a bigger match.

The best areas for nightlife are the navigli (canals) southwest of the city centre and the Brera district near La Scala. </p> <p><strong> Extra time:</strong> The Duomo (cathedral) is Milan's most famous landmark and offers views of the city and the Alps. The designer shops along Montenapoleone and Via Spigo are cathedrals to another kind of religion. Prices for Italian labels are cheaper than the UK. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> Antica Locanda Solferino, Via Castelfidardo 2, (+39 2 6570129 <a href=\"http://www.anticalocandasolferino.it/\">anticalocandasolferino.it</a>, doubles from \u20ac100) is a charming 19th-century inn in the heart of Brera.

Roma are led by the talismanic Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella. Cash-strapped Lazio have re-signed Paolo di Canio in the hope he will conjure up some magic for one last season. </p> <p><strong> The big match:</strong> Il Derby della Capitale is the rowdiest in Italy (Jan 6 and May 5 2005). With the laziali at the curva nord and romanisti at the curva sud, the fun starts with the coreografia, the impressive displays of co-ordinated card holding that fill each end of the ground. These games are also worth catching: Lazio play <strong> Milan</strong> (Sep 29), <strong> Inter</strong> (Mar 13 2005) and <strong> Juve</strong> (April 24 2005); Roma play <strong> Inter </strong> (Oct 3), <strong> Juve </strong> (March 6 2005) and <strong> Milan </strong> (March 20 2005). </p> <p>To get to the ground take metro Line A to Ottaviano - S. Pietro, then jump on the 32 bus with everyone else. </p> <p><strong> Just the ticket:</strong> From \u20ac16 behind the goals with the hardcore (not a great view) up to around \u20ac120. The tevere lateral for around \u20ac70 is a good option. You can buy tickets on the day at the stadium, in town at lotto kiosks, Orbis in Piazza Esquilino 37, (+39 06 482 7403) or the club stores: Roma's is at Piazza Colonna 360 (+39 06 68 651), Lazio's at Via Farini 34 (+39 06 482 6768). </p> <p><strong> Swift one:</strong> Bar San Calisto (Piazza San Calisto) with old pictures of both teams on the wall, is good for a cheap beer on the terrace. It's in lively Trastevere, where Romans go to play at night. <br><strong> Extra time:</strong> There's so much to see in Rome you might forget about the footie. If you only have time to visit one attraction go and marvel at the Colosseum (\u20ac8, or \u20ac16 if you join a group with a guide to skip the queue). </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> Mid-range hotels are difficult to find, so book early. The refurbished Residenza Cellini near the Trevi Fountain, Via Modena 5, (+39 06 47825204, <a href=\"http://www.residenzacellini.it/\">residenzacellini.it</a>) has doubles from \u20ac145.

For important matches, however, there are only two ways of getting a ticket: from a tout or through a travel agent. As in the UK, touting is illegal but common. If you do opt for this method, try to buy from a socio, or member, selling a spare seat. </p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> Always check where in the stadium your seat is before buying from a UK agent. ATP Sports Events (0870 9906787, <a href=\"http://www.atpsportsevents.com\">atpsportsevents.com</a>) offer packages ranging from \u00a3149pp for match tickets plus two nights' accommodation (no flights) to Lisbon or Porto, through to \u00a3520-\u00a3549pp for Barcelona v Real Madrid with flights, two nights' hotel accommodation and match tickets.

They entertain Real Madrid on Nov 21. The French are less fanatical about le foot than their southern neighbours - except in Marseille where <strong> Olympique </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.olympiquedemarseille.com\">olympiquedemarseille.com</a>) is part of the lifeblood of the city. Despite Porto's recent dominance, <strong> Benfica </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.slbenfica.pt\">slbenfica.pt</a>) are still the biggest club in Portugal and their famous Stadium of Light, rebuilt for Euro 2004, is awesome. Further afield, the local derbies between <strong> Olympiakos </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.olympiakos.gr\">olympiakos.gr</a>) and <strong> Panathinaikos </strong> (<a href=\"http://www.pao.gr\">pao.gr</a>) in Athens, and <strong> Galatasaray </strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.galatasaray.net\">galatasaray.net</a>) and <strong> Fenerbache </strong> (<a href=\"http://www.fenerbache.org\">fenerbache.org</a>) in Istanbul are exhilarating, often wild occasions.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Grumpy Old Men: A Manual for the British Malcontent</strong> <br>by David Quantick <br>143pp, HarperCollins, \u00a39.99 </p> <p><strong> All Oiks Now: The Unnoticed Surrender of Middle England</strong><br> by Digby Anderson <br>95pp, Social Affairs Unit, \u00a39.95 </p> <p><strong> Mr Wonderful Takes a Cruise: The Adventures of an Old-Age Pensioner</strong> <br>by John Nott <br>218pp, Ebury Press, \u00a39.99</p> <p>I am, in one respect, an ideal person to review this collection of moans by ageing males. I fit perfectly the demographic group cited by David Quantick as the grumpiest in Britain - men aged between 35 and 54. I'm well into the second half of that grumpy age range and getting more peevish by the day. But there is a problem: I didn't see the highly successful BBC2 series that \"inspired\" Quantick's moaners' manifesto and have no idea what connection there is between programme and book. I would guess none; this looks like a shameless piece of bandwagon-chasing. </p> <p>I didn't see the TV series because I don't watch television, except the news headlines at 10pm on BBC1 (the remainder of the bulletin, with its nodding-dog correspondents, is too painful), Test cricket on Channel 4 (thankfully the one-day rubbish is confined to Sky) and occasional late-night porn on Channel 5. The rest of my time I spend listening to Schumann. </p> <p>I was well disposed towards Quantick's book until I read the flyleaf. Quantick, who appears principally to be a comedy writer, is also described as an \"active journalist\". What on earth is that? Can journalists, other perhaps than leader writers, be inactive? Worse, Kazakhstan is spelt \"Khazakstan\". The book is badly organised, written with a sort of comic desperation, and printed on appalling paper which ensures that the photographs (in any case superfluous) are virtually blacked out. </p> <p>Quantick does score some hits, though it was not until page 31 that I found myself nodding vigorously in agreement, when he rounds on hotels that put notices in the bathroom suggesting that you use the same towels throughout your stay \"for the sake of the environment\". He suggests putting up a counter-notice: \"I am the environment and I am sick of being blamed for the fact that you can't be bothered to wash your towels every day.\" (He actually writes \"you bastards can't be bothered\", which weakens the comic effect, but everything here is overegged.) </p> <p>The towels notice is a good target because it is unexpected. His dismissal of \"the theatre\" - cramped, rip-off programmes and everyone knows how King Lear ends anyway - also strikes a chord. Elsewhere, there are too many of the usual suspects: theme pubs, burger bars, speed humps, call centres, muzak. You don't have to be a grumpy old man to be irritated by these; just vaguely human. </p> <p>Some of Quantick's targets are ludicruous. Supermarkets, which he calls \"giant stadiums of consumer hell\", are a delight, especially the new automated checkouts which save having to deal with any people at all. He attacks drivers of black cabs, but in my experience they are clever, honest and almost universally helpful, and they never \"talk bollocks\" (as he claims) these days because they have an earpiece stuck in their ear and are discussing loft conversions with their mate in Romford. Quantick also professes to dislike traffic wardens, yet these fine, upstanding citizens walk around in wretched weather for eight hours a day in an effort to keep our streets congestion free (and, even more importantly, allow me to park outside my own house in our parking-controlled street). Some mornings I feel like hugging the traffic warden. </p> <p>I distrust Quantick's range of b\u00eates noires. No one really hates mime artists, clowns, astrologers, 30-year-old pizza delivery \"boys\", estate agents or the royals. They may be ludicrous, but they're not loathsome. Their sins are far more excusable than, say, not being able to spell Kazakhstan. This is a list that a group of editors would produce who wanted to cash in on the success of a television series. I noticed it is doing well in the bestsellers' list, so the ruse appears to have worked. </p> <p>Digby Anderson's All Oiks Now is not really a book at all; it's an extended pamphlet-cum-provocation issued by the Social Affairs Unit (a rightwing pressure group) to mark him stepping down as director after 24 years. At one level, it is deeply offensive, endlessly banging on about the \"lower orders\" and how the middle classes (Anderson's beloved Middle England) have accepted their value systems - poor pronunciation, sloppy dress, not eating at table, failing to control their children, falling into debt. It is nonsense, but at least it's heartfelt nonsense. It wasn't inspired by a TV series; the grumpiness is for real. </p> <p>Anderson was evidently brought up in the 1950s: grey, deferential, children seen but not heard, laconic barbers cutting your hair for one and six, men in hats applauding politely at cricket matches. He is profoundly irritated by 21st-century Britain: middle-aged women pretending to be teenagers, unruly children, \"stylists\" who charge you \u00a320 for a haircut, cricket matches ruined by Mexican waves and Yorkshiremen dressed as nuns. Ignore the class bias - the working class loathe all this stuff too - and many of his gripes about our sloppy, infantilised, credit-dependent, celebrity-obsessed culture (sic) are legitimate, though he does himself no favours by wondering whether a war (\"a long and horrific one\") might be the solution. All very 30s and a high price to pay to stop morons emblazoning FCUK across their chests. </p> <p>Anderson tries (and fails) to be systematic. John Nott, who is of an even older vintage and a former Conservative minister (you may remember his contretemps with Robin Day), shares many of the same prejudices, but still manages to produce quite a jolly survey of contemporary Britain. The premise is that Nott, released from the City at 70, is a latterday Rip van Winkle who sets out to rediscover his homeland. The opening is promising: \"I was born before the invention of the pill, television, dishwashers, disposable nappies and New Labour. In those days, a 'chip' was a fried potato. We had 'crumpets' for tea. 'Grass' was mown. 'Coke' was something you put on the fire. A 'joint' was a piece of meat that you ate for Sunday lunch and 'gay' people were the life and soul of the party, not members of the Cabinet.\" </p> <p>The work, which is wildly discursive, never quite lives up to that overture, but there are some diverting episodes - visits to a Spearmint Rhino club (enjoyable), the nightclub Chinawhite (awful), a Buckingham Palace garden party (splendid). Nott, who hates spending money, gives an amusing description of his attempt to smuggle his own wine into dinner on a cruise ship. He also thinks about sex a great deal and likes to chat up young women on buses. It is behaviour pleasingly unbecoming to a privy councillor and former secretary of state for defence. </p> <p>His views are those you might expect of a septuagenarian Tory who has spent most of his life in the City. A dash of homophobia; suspiciously frequent references to the number of black faces seen and foreign languages heard in London; a dislike of fat working-class women in tight-fitting tops, the internet, health clubs, happy-clappy priests, the Guardian, estuary English, NHS bureaucracy. But he has such fun chatting up lapdancers, looking at vibrators in Ann Summers shops, learning the foxtrot (in preparation for his cruise to Norway) and riding on the number 19 bus that all his moans have to be taken with a large pinch of salt, and his ultimate refusal to condemn comes as no surprise. \"The elderly must not become old Grundys, deploring the modern world, saying that the country is not what it was. It never has been.\" </p> <p>Nott has passed through menopausal middle age, with its unremitting, soul-destroying grumpiness, and is growing old disgracefully, laughing at the world's absurdities with a Falstaffian grandeur and detachment. There may yet be hope for Digby and me.</p>",

Despite the mainstream exposure, her new album, Med\u00falla, is her oddest yet - with human sounds taking the place of instruments and a couple of songs the Observer Music Monthly compared to a cat coughing up a fur ball. You can hear samples of every track along with a veritable landslide of PC screensavers, interviews and kooky photos at this admirably value-packed site.

  "<p><strong>Namco II: Ms Pac-Man </strong><br>Console</p> <p>In the days before videogames became a multi-billion global industry, when Nintendo was still making playing cards, if you wanted to play a game it was more than likely made by Waddingtons or MB. Then, in the 1970s, TV games arrived, allowing you to plug in and enjoy the awesome power of bat and ball in the comfort of your own home. In the 21st century we naturally expect a bit more, and the latest battery-powered no-nonsense 1980s arcade simulators feature five classic games and no need to mess about with cartridges or DVDs. This one features Ms Pac-Man (easily the best Pac-Man variation); the excellent Galaxian-style Galaga; good, but tendonitis-inducing Xevious; sorely ageing Pole Position; and poor old also-ran Mappy. Batteries not included. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Namco, \u00a325</p> <p><strong>ShellShock: Nam '67 </strong><br>PS2, XBox, PC</p> <p>Setting out to communicate the harrowing life of a grunt in the Vietnam war, ShellShock goes out of its way to present a warts and all view of the conflict and the American and North Vietnamese armies. What emerges is harrowing only in its lumbering awkwardness. Your team mates are not only indestructible - able to walk about amid machine gunfire without injury - but also ineffectual, shooting for hours into groups of suicidal VC without any perceptible result. Meanwhile, missions around your marine fire base offer little more than excuses to listen to your colleagues swearing.

Despite its glitches and faintly tired looks, there's a lot of game here for \u00a320, including new maps, extra guns and fresh multiplayer modes.</p>",
  "<p>North Korea must take urgent action to protect its environment, the UN environment programme said yesterday, publishing its first report on the deforestation and pollution caused by more than a decade of famine and economic hardship. </p> <p>It said the search for food and fuel had led to the felling of a tenth of the country's trees since 1990, threatening the habitats of rare species and increasing the risk of soil erosion and flooding. </p> <p>Although the authors admit that much of the information is old and incomplete, the study and its publication - both done with the cooperation of the North Korean authorities - is hailed as a breakthrough. </p> <p>Until now the government has either ignored the environment or launched ad hoc measures, such as the campaign for every citizen to walk 10,000 steps a day rather than use buses and trams. </p> <p>Unep's executive director, Klaus T\u00f6pfer, said: \"This country has very severe environmental challenges.\" But he praised the government for making a commitment yesterday to work with the international community to clear up the damage. </p> <p>\"The most important consequence is that there is a full dedication for cooperation and that there is a full understanding that there must be done more for the environment.\" </p> <p>At first sight, the spectacular deindustrialisation of North Korea since the collapse of the Soviet bloc appears to have been beneficial to the environment. The halving of the country's output between 1992 and 1996 has closed countless factories. </p> <p>But the report points out that the search for fuel, power and farmland has forced many of the 24.4 million people into the hills in search of firewood. </p> <p>In the six years from 1990 the volume of timber burned in homes and factories more than doubled. At least 144,000 hectares (359,900 acres) of woodland has been lost. </p> <p>Although 80% of the land is still forested, most of the remaining trees are on inaccessible mountain slopes. </p> <p>During the years of famine in the mid-1990s, many hills were stripped in an attempt to expand farmland. With a harvest 20% short of needs, aid workers say they have seen peasants trying to grow wheat on slopes so steep that they are unable to stand straight. </p> <p>\"It's very evident that more and more marginal land is being brought into use, which has had an adverse environmental impact,\" Gerry Bourke of the World Food Programme said. </p> <p>\"They are cultivating hillsides and even hilltops that should be left fallow. When the rain comes, it all just gets washed off and you get a growing problem of soil erosion.\" </p> <p>Other problems reported include the pollution of rivers with sewage, leading to the spread of water-borne disease; and air pollution, partly caused by the heavy reliance on coal. </p> <p>With the population expected to grow to 29m by 2020, the government expects a fivefold increase in the demand for coal for domestic fires and industrial boilers and kilns.</p>",
  "In an alleyway next to Najaf's Imam Ali shrine, Commander Sayed Haider rested yesterday. <p>For more than three weeks he and his fellow fighters from the Mahdi army had battled against the vast firepower of the US military. Now was a time to reflect. </p> <p>\"We believe that we are right. This is our country. This is our city. We will not accept that people come and occupy our land,\" he said. </p> <p>Nearby, fighters were lugging the corpse of a dead comrade out from the shattered ruins of a hotel; others were brewing tea. </p> <p>Thousands of pilgrims, meanwhile, had begun flowing past the sandbags and metal barricades which until recently had blocked the path of American tanks. </p> <p>\"We didn't give in for one reason,\" Mr Haider explained, as his platoon posed for photos, still holding their rocket-propelled grenade launchers. \"Our beliefs,\" he said. </p> <p>In the end, the battle for Najaf that had plunged Iraq's interim government into crisis ended, to everyone's surprise and relief, peacefully yesterday. </p> <p>On Thursday evening Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most important Shia leader, and Mr Haider's boss Moqtada al-Sadr, had agreed a deal under which Mr Sadr's Shia militia would vacate the Imam Ali shrine and go home. To some surprise, they did. </p> <p>Initially not everyone was on message: as the pilgrims filed through into a narrow alleyway of bullet-ridden camera shops and colonnades, a sniper started firing. But by mid-morning, the mood had turned jolly. </p> <p>\"I've been here for five months. I've only seen my wife once a month during that time. I'm going back to Baghdad as soon as I've finished my breakfast,\" Abu al-Musawi said, waving a victory kebab. \"It's peace,\" he added. Inside the shrine, dozens of Sadr supporters were dancing in a circle, waving placards of their leader; outside in the street a man was pushing a cart, carrying a mortar ineptly hidden under a blanket. </p> <p>Asked whether he had now handed in his Kalashnikov to the Iraqi authorities, Abu Gaffar, a 25-year-old Mahdi army fighter, looked baffled. \"It's my personal weapon. I can't give it to the police or the army. I'll keep it in a safe place,\" he promised. </p> <p>Until yesterday, the market square leading to the shrine and the alleys around it had been the centre of vicious fighting between US marines and the Mahdi. Yesterday, across what was the frontline, the full scale of the devastation became clear. Tank rounds littered the road; the al-Dawha hotel had been blown apart; several of the tombs in Najaf's old cemetery had been pulverised. The souk was a tangle of metal debris; on the floor, unnoticed, lay a ripped poster of David Beckham. </p> <p>Over in the old city it was the same story. In among the piles of rubbish lay a dead dog; from the seemingly empty houses came the smell of rotting flesh. </p> <p>But what had it all meant? </p> <p>Yesterday Abu Hussein Muhammad, a Najaf local, said he did not support Mr Sadr and was sceptical that peace would now descend on Iraq. </p> <p>\"We support Bush and the coalition forces. They allowed us to get rid of this monster,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Hussein said that the Mahdi army had slit the throat of one of his neighbours, a police officer. \"These people are savages,\" he said. </p> <p>There was stark evidence for his claim: in a building that served as Mr Sadr's Sharia court, just behind the shrine, police stumbled upon some of his army's apparent victims. </p> <p>The Guardian counted 20 corpses - stinking, blackened and disfigured, on the floor beneath a judicial clock. It appeared they had been tortured. Given the state of the bodies, nobody could be sure. But other survivors were unequivocal in their praise for Mr Sadr. \"Moqtada is the son of Iraq,\" Abu Ahmed, 28, said on his way to the shrine, his two-year-old son Ahmed perched on his shoulders clutching a multicoloured plastic Kalashnikov. </p> <p>What kind of future did he envisage for Ahmed? \"He'll join the Mahdi army,\" Mr Ahmed said. \"I'll teach him to fight Americans.\" </p> <p>By late morning the human shields who had spent days sleeping inside the Imam Ali shrine had left. The cleaners had arrived and were rolling up the carpets. A few golden tiles had fallen off one of the minarets, but otherwise the building appeared remarkably undamaged. </p> <p>In an air-conditioned audience room, Mr Sadr's spokesman Sheikh Ahmed Shaibani explained the five-point peace plan signed by Mr Sadr and Mr Sistani. </p> <p>Under the agreement the Mahdi army would leave Najaf and Kufa; the Iraqi police would take over security in both towns; and the Iraqi government would compensate those whose property was destroyed in the fighting. </p> <p>The Americans would also pull out of both cities - something that yesterday had not happened. </p> <p>Asked what the uprising had achieved, Mr Shaibani said it had proved that the al-Marjia'ya - the committee of Shia scholars headed by Mr Sistani - was the ultimate authority in Iraq. </p> <p>He added: \"The Mahdi army will never be disarmed. We have proved it is a religious army.\" </p> <p>Tantalisingly, Mr Shaibani hinted that Mr Sadr might take up a post in Iraq's next government - provided next year's elections were \"honest\" and the Americans did not try to manipulate them. </p> <p>The political parties would also create a \"suitable environment\" for a proper census to be carried out to facilitate elections and the \"return of full sovereignty\" to Iraq, he announced. </p> <p>By late afternoon Iraqi troops were patrolling the old city for the first time; American soldiers were loafing some distance away on a traffic roundabout. Three tanks were sitting in a dusty car park. </p> <p>Earlier, before going home, the Mahdi army fighters had been recounting their tales of martyrdom. </p> <p>\"In the last couple of hours before the ceasefire one of my friends died while he was firing his Kalashnikov at a helicopter,\" Jawad Abdul Khadi, 24, said. \"Fortunately our brothers shot it down over the cemetery.\" </p> <p>Mr Khadi claimed that during the entire battle only 61 of his \"brothers\" were killed - with only \"one or two fighters\" dying each day. </p> <p>And what would happen now he was asked? </p> <p>\"There are still a lot of us left,\" he said.</p>",
  "President Bush yesterday conceded for the first time that he had \"miscalculated\" the post-war situation in Iraq, but insisted US strategy was flexible enough to deal with the insurgency. <p>The admission, in an interview with the New York Times, made news because the president is not given to revisiting his decisions. Asked in April if he had made mistakes in office, he was unable to think of any. </p> <p>However, a report on the Abu Ghraib torture scandal, released this week, put some of the blame for the \"chaos\" at the Iraqi prison on the administration's failure to prepare adequately for an insurgency. The report, by James Schlesinger, a conservative Republican and former secretary of defence, said the Pentagon's war plans had assumed a \"benign\" postwar environment. </p> <p>In his interview, Mr Bush said he had made a \"miscalculation of what the conditions would be\" in postwar Iraq. But he said that was the result of the \"swift victory\" against the Iraqi army, which collapsed so fast that it was able to melt away and stage a guerrilla insurgency. </p> <p>Ivo Daalder, a former member of Bill Clinton's National Security Council and now an analyst at Brookings Institution, said the president's remarks showed \"a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation\". </p> <p>\"If the Iraqi defences fell quicker, we should have more troops in Baghdad. Had they had more troops there, they would have been able to deal with the insurgency more quickly and effectively,\" Mr Daalder said. \"This was not miscalculation. This was ignoring military advice.\" </p> <p>The president again refused to condemn a political advertisement by rightwing ex-soldiers - the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth - who claim the Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, lied about his war record. Instead, he repeated his earlier call for all advertising by such non-party groups to be banned. </p> <p>But Mr Bush made it clear he did not agree with the central message of the advertisement. \"I think Senator Kerry should be proud of his record,\" he said. \"No, I don't think he lied.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gas and electricity customers who have never switched suppliers are now paying at least 20% more than people who have changed, following another round of energy company price hikes. </p> <p>Last week, two of the UK's biggest providers, EDF and British Gas, both reacted to soaring global energy prices by announcing price rises well above inflation. </p> <p>According to price comparison firm Uswitch (<a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com\">uswitch.com</a>, tel: 0845-601-2856), the most recent hikes now mean that on average householders will be around \u00a3150 a year better off by switching supplier from the most expensive company, British Gas, in favour of the cheapest provider, Scottish Power. </p> <p>Early in the week, EDF, which owns London Energy, Seeboard and SWEB announced it was increasing its domestic gas prices by 3.5%, adding \u00a312 to an annual bill. Electricity prices are rising by 3.8%, which adds another \u00a310. </p> <p>When combined with price rises announced earlier in the year, electricity prices have risen by 10.5% and gas by 8.1% during 2004 - the most recent rises come in to force on September 3. </p> <p>However, EDF was eclipsed by British Gas two days later when it announced its second big price rise for 2004. From September 20, its 12 million gas customers can look forward to paying an extra 12.4% while electricity customers will see their bills increase by a further 9.4%. British Gas, which is the largest domestic gas supplier in the UK, had already raised its prices by 5.9% in January. All the big companies have increased prices at least once this year. </p> <p>Alistair Tillen, chief executive officer at price comparison company SimplySwitch (<a href=\"http://www.simplyswitch.com\">simplyswitch.com</a>, tel: 0800-781-1212), says consumers should be spurred on to change suppliers. </p> <p>\"It is no surprise that British Gas has raised its prices - it needed to close the gap, as wholesale gas prices have increased, to protect profits. However, this latest price increase is a real sting in the tail for consumers and far outstrips that of any other energy company.\" </p> <p>\"Consumers would not stand for this level of increase from their phone or mortgage provider and we hope that British Gas customers seriously look for the better value alternatives that are readily available. </p> <p>\"Last month, British Gas's parent company Centrica announced that they were 10% more profitable than the same time last year. Despite this, British Gas has still increased prices by an inflation-busting amount,\" he said. </p> <p>British Gas lost 220,000 customers when it increased prices last time, and analysts expect more to desert the company before next month's price hikes start hitting bills. </p> <p>Switching supplier is very easy. The supply is uninterrupted and the only thing that changes is the name at the top of your bill. </p> <p>Consumers can either visit Uswitch or SimplySwitch's websites (or phone) and they will be told which company offers the cheapest prices. </p> <p>To get substantial discounts, customers have to buy both their gas and electricity from the same company (dual fuel) and pay by direct debit. The amount of power you consume will determine which company is best for you. </p> <p>Also, if you are happy to receive your bills online there are further discounts available.</p>",
  "To attribute the decline in applications for undergraduate American studies degrees and the closure of departments to \"a groundswell of anti-American feeling\" (A degree in bullying and self-interest?, August 25) is to link one set of events to a larger phenomenon with no evidence of a causal relationship. For half a century students have held widely diverse opinions about the US, while studying that nation: I was one of many students who protested against US missiles on British shores, while reading American studies a quarter-century ago. <p>The apparent decline has more to do with changes in higher education than shifting opinions about US policies. American studies has often been taught by volunteers, undertaking additional teaching outside their home departments. But retirements and the loss of teaching staff, plus increasing teaching and administrative loads have made several of these programmes unviable: one that has closed recently lost a large majority of its teaching staff over the last decade. </p> <p>In addition, the rising cost of a degree has adversely affected recruitment for courses that often include an addi tional year at a US university. At the postgraduate level, however, American studies is thriving throughout the UK. </p> <p>The same edition of the Guardian covered the Republican convention in New York, Brooklyn's Red Hook Justice Centre, Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion, and even the possible acquisition of Glenmorangie by Jack Daniels. The US remains of vital interest to us all and our students acknowledge this. Let 's not indulge in America-bashing while neglecting the problems facing British students and universities.<br> <b>Prof Simon Newman</b><br> University of Glasgow, and chair, British Association for American Studies </p> <p>Polly Toynbee says \"between the American ideal and the American reality falls the longest shadow. Discuss.\" I do, week in and week out, with inquisitive American studies students. I would have hoped that concern about the neocons' global impact would lead more people to study US culture; there they would encounter Americans, past and present, standing firm against rightwing hegemony. </p> <p>I'd suggest Frederick Douglass's The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro speech of 1852 as a starter: \"There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour\": and that's just warming-up.<br> <b>Dr Keith Hughes</b><br> Edinburgh University </p> <p>The drop in applications has more to do with top-up fees and the cost of a degree (often four years, with one spent in the US) and the reluctance of some universities to support area studies. As for the supposed hostility to the US, undergraduate applications to my department rose every year between 1997 and 2003. Our staff and students have a wide variety of perspectives and make valuable contributions to scholarship on US literature, history, media, and culture, as well as US foreign policy.<br> <b>Prof Scott Lucas</b><br> University of Birmingham </p> <p>The fact is that students no longer get a year-long, local authority-funded excursion to the US.

  "<p>Three weeks ago, the wind was very warm on the Firth of Clyde. We remarked on its untypical heat as it bent the bracken and rhododendrons on the Argyll coast; a fancy, foreign wind coming up from the south where it had been brewed (so the papers said) by a hurricane in the Caribbean. None of us could remember such a warm wind in Scotland before. When you came out of the sea you pretty well immediately stopped shuddering. In the evening, we went to a hotel and asked if we could take our drinks outside to the garden. \"You'll need to be quick,\" the barman said, because by that time the sky had changed from blue to purple-black, with showers tugging down delicate fronds of cloud to the hills in Kintyre.</p> <p>Then the wind died and it began to rain properly. A couple of hours later the road was like a river on the hills and a pond in the hollows, and the car headlights picked out thousands of frogs that were seizing their chance to explore this unexpected new wetland. We drove farther north through the rain the next day and came across sights that were at first merely exciting: a familiar glen had been suddenly converted into a long loch, with sheep and cattle perched on its freshly created islands; swollen burns and rivers had risen above their bridgeworks and spread earth and rock across the road; patches of sea had turned into milky coffee and uprooted trees drifted helplessly among the foam. Towards the head of Loch Fyne, we began to see fresh brown scars on the steep green hillside, where the earth, which had rested snug and content there for many centuries, had found a life of its own and slipped away.</p> <p>It was only at Cairndow at the loch's end that we changed from interested spectators to concerned travellers. A landslip had torn through a cottage and spread mud and rubble across the main road to Inveraray and Kintyre. There was no way forward and only a complicated way back (through the private lane of a Highland estate), because other landslides had blocked the roads to Glasgow and Dunoon. The pub was filled with mystified drivers, wondering what to do next. Older people remembered the newspaper pictures of Aberfan, but not even the oldest could remember anything of the sort happening in Argyll before, at least in summer.</p> <p>We talked about the weather and for how many hours or days the roads would be closed. But we didn't blame ourselves, our prosperity, our cars, our planes, our central heating, our reckless burning of coal and oil; a way of living that you could argue had its origins very close to here, James Watt being a Greenock man and the world's first sea-going steamships coming up the loch well before the battle of Waterloo (and, up there in the early 19th-century stratosphere, the hydro-carbon from the world's first industrial nation starting a process whose effects would remain unknown for almost 200 years).</p> <p>Nobody said as they debated the immediate future of the A82, \"That's it. No more cars for me. How do I join the Green party?\" Nobody promised to be a better dweller on and for this Earth. No connections were made between the atmosphere's behaviour and our own. \"Global warming\" is a phrase that a dozen years ago implied unpleasant things happening to faraway people - a rising sea drowning Pacific atolls and large parts of Bangladesh - while in Britain we imagined vineyards in the Pennines and Mediterranean summers. Few of us realised that climate change would mean \"extreme weather\" - extreme not just in heat, but in wind and rain and unpredictability.</p> <p>The consequences are too late to stop but not too late to modify, so that perhaps in 50 or 100 years' time the glaciers and the icecaps could end their retreat and the climate begin to stabilise. Science (most of it) agrees that we need to change the way we live, but we refuse to do it. We like cars, motorways, cheap flights, untaxed aviation fuel. Governments, even when not as wilfully blind to the future as the present American regime, are fearful of their electorates and our consuming desires. In any case, what about the growing economies of India and China? Who will deny their populations' ambition to enjoy the consumables that historically have been mainly the preserve of Europe and North America?</p> <p>It seems we have made our fate and feel helpless before it. Driving back, I thought of Gandhi and his anti-industrialism, every village its own government, every person to his own spinning-wheel and a diet of goat's milk and vegetables. He had asked people to renounce things, including the popular, material idea of betterment, but even in a country used to the idea of renunciation, where the simple life and the spiritual life are often confused, where the poor with nothing to lose were much more numerous than the rich, it had found few takers. That today's world could embrace a similar movement, restricting human need and desire, hus banding and more equally sharing finite resources, seems close to impossible.</p> <p>At home, the rain still plinking against the windows, I read more of my proof copy of Jeremy Treglown's excellent biography of VS Pritchett, published in October. I came across a passage about a celebrated symposium published by the Left Review in 1937 called \"Authors Take Sides on the Spanish War\". Many writers, most on the Republican side, contributed (including WH Auden, Samuel Beckett, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler) and the idea has been reprised many times. The Guardian sometimes does it, most recently on Iraq. What side writers privately take in public arguments is always interesting to know and even, improbably and very occasionally, influential.</p> <p>But wars in other countries are easy stuff, involving personal opinion (easy to give) rather than a change in personal behaviour (harder to make). And yet climate change is, we are told, a far bigger threat to the world's civilised future than terrorism (though it will undoubtedly promote various kinds of armed struggle in itself).</p> <p>Which writers would stand up and be counted on global warming if the symposium were entitled \"Authors Take Sides on Their Volvo, Their Second Home, Their Easyjet Flights to Tuscany, and Their Weekly Drive to Waitrose?\" I hope not to be asked.</p> <p>\u00b7 Ian Jack is editor of Granta magazine</p>",

  "Farmers hit by the worst harvest in memory are considering abandoning cereals and grassing over fields to exploit a European Union subsidy regime which kicks in next year, the government's rural adviser warned yesterday. <p>Lord Haskins said the bad weather, which has left farmers facing multimillion-pound losses as waterlogged wheatfields are written off, could cause more damage to the industry than the foot and mouth epidemic in 2001. </p> <p>With farmers expected to lose \u00a3100 for each acre under grain, some experts estimate the overall cost could top \u00a31bn. </p> <p>The Guardian this week highlighted the plight of farmers in the north facing financial ruin after abandoning both oil seed rape crops and cereals such as wheat. </p> <p>Paul Ibbott, the chief arable adviser of the National Farmers' union (NFU), said barely a third of the wheat crop had been harvested at a time of year when farmers should be clearing fields to prepare for seeding. \"It will be very serious if we get to September without much harvesting,\" he added. \"Farmers will be facing severe financial problems, and in some cases face going to the wall.\" </p> <p>Lord Haskins, who has farmed in East Yorkshire for 30 years, claimed arable farmers were potentially facing worse problems than livestock farmers had during the foot and mouth crisis because no compensation is available for crops that are written off. </p> <p>The seven-month foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 led to the slaughter of more than 6m animals and cost the taxpayer more than \u00a33bn. </p> <p>\"During the foot and mouth epidemic, farmers were more than adequately compensated and made money out of it,\" added Lord Haskins. </p> <p>\"But no government is going to compensate for the vagaries of the weather, nor should they. Having said that, this is the worst harvest I have known in my farming years.\" </p> <p>He claimed that, in many respects, ground conditions were similar to the 1845 potato blight in Ireland - \"high humidity alongside a lot of rain\". Worryingly, blight is now appearing on the potato crop in parts of Britain for the first time in many years. </p> <p>In the north, farmers are being forced to extend overdrafts with empty grain stores, combine harvesters unable to reach sodden fields - and the prospect of low prices for a poor crop if it ever gets to market. Some say it will be cheaper to abandon fields rather than accept rock-bottom prices. </p> <p>With the EU's reformed common agricultural policy due to be introduced next January, with the aim of \"decoupling\" subsidies from production to prevent oversupply, Lord Haskins predicted that some arable farmers would consider moving out of cereals altogether. </p> <p>While some fields would be \"set aside\" and taken out of production, others would be devoted to grass for raising more livestock. </p> <p>Both the NFU and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) are considering how farmers - particularly in north-east England, the worst affected area - can be helped through the crisis. </p> <p>One idea is to coordinate a mutual aid scheme, under which farmers in eastern England and the south who have harvested can help others in the north unable to enter waterlogged fields. </p> <p>An NFU spokesman said: \"We are looking to facilitate any way for those farmers who have harvested to help those who have not. </p> <p>\"We are also exploring, with Defra, the possibility of bringing forward assisted payments that farmers would normally receive throughout the year to cover the current difficulties.\" </p> <p>Defra acknowledged that while the harvest was \"one of the wettest and slowest on record\" it would take several weeks to assess the scale of the problem: \"We share the concerns of farmers and, like them, we are hoping for a spell of sunny weather.\"</p>",
  "<p>People sometimes ask me where I get my ideas from. The answer is, 'All over the place' - sometimes where I might least expect to find them. I've recently become involved in the work a group of historians is carrying out at Hampton Court. The kitchens at the palace are open to the public, but every so often they also play host to these historians, who immerse themselves in the kitchen environment and cook, taking questions along the way. And when I say immerse, I mean immerse. </p> <p>The kitchens are unique in this country and can be adapted to exactly the conditions that would have characterised them in Tudor, Elizabethan or Jacobean periods. Depending on what period the historians are intent on exploring, everything - the equipment they use, the clothes they wear, the recipes they follow, the methods they employ - is as authentic as they can make it. To show just how precise they are, the last time I saw them they were wearing brown waistcoats and brown trousers that had been dyed with onion skins, which, apparently, used to be the practice. </p> <p>If they have a recipe from, say, 1570, which calls for the mixture of whatever is being cooked to be passed through a colander, they find out what a colander looked like in 1570 - how big it was, what it was made of, whether it had any special features - then they have it made to those specifications. They even went to the Canary Islands to find the right kind of cochineal beetle for food colouring for an Elizabethan recipe. </p> <p>And people think I'm a stickler for detail. </p> <p>Our working relationship is still at an early stage, but I find this kind of investigation really inspirational, and I will be returning to the kitchens of Hampton Court for further columns.</p>",
  "The celebrated - and entirely self-taught - production designer Don Ashton, who has died aged 85, was the man responsible for designing, building and destroying the central feature of the seven-Oscar winning film, The Bridge On The River Kwai. The screenplay of David Lean's 1957 movie, via the novel by Pierre Bouille, was loosely based on fact: the building of a railway bridge by British prisoners-of-war for the Japanese during the second world war. <p>During pre-production, Ashton visited the original site in Thailand, but was disappointed to find that the area was flat and lacked wild vegetation. However, during the war, he had been stationed at Kandy, in what was then Ceylon, with the staff of the supreme allied commander in south-east Asia, Lord Louis Mountbatten. Ashton remembered that \"there were plenty of mountains and jungles and rivers, so I went down there to have a look,\" he told Lean's biographer, Kevin Brownlow. </p> <p>Once back in the area, Ashton discovered an ideal location, a stretch of river 60 miles from Colombo, the capital. Because the construction of the bridge was the central issue of the story, it was impossible to use a miniature. So he designed a structure along the lines of the Forth bridge in Scotland; it was nothing like the actual bridge built by the PoWs on the Burma-Siam railway, but it had more visual impact. </p> <p>A great deal of the film budget went on the bridge, which took longer to build than the original. When it came to blowing it up, Ashton must have felt as ambivalent as Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) about the demolition of his beloved creation. </p> <p>Ashton was born in Edmonton, London, the son of a wine buyer, and educated at Boxlane school, Palmers Green. During his wartime service, he married Helen Horsfall, a tea planter's daughter, just before returning to England and, encouraged by Emlyn Williams, entering the film industry. His first movie job was on Brighton Rock (1947). </p> <p>He got his first credit in 1950, at the age of 31, as art director on a minor British film, Portrait Of Clare, for which he designed the interiors of a stately home. He went on to make around two dozen more pictures, first as art director and then as production designer, responsible for the overall look of the film. </p> <p>This Ashton did with some style, as early as his second film, Murder Without Crime (1950), in which he created the opulent d\u00e9cor for the house of suave blackmailer Dennis Price, although the film itself was an inauspicious directorial debut for J Lee Thompson. Considering the austerity and turgid nature of many postwar British films, it was a wonder that Ashton was able to make his mark. </p> <p>There followed three wartime-based films, two of them starring Dirk Bogarde: Appointment In London (1952) and They Who Dare (1953), which was Ashton's first colour production. The third movie, The Purple Plain (1954), shot in Ceylon with Gregory Peck, anticipated The Bridge On The River Kwai. </p> <p>Ashton was also in his element in the chic escapism of two Stanley Donen movies. These were Indiscreet (1958), with Cary Grant courting Ingrid Bergman in a gorgeous London flat, and Surprise Package (1960), with Noel Coward as an exiled king on a Mediterranean island. </p> <p>Better still was his design of an 18th-century British warship for Peter Ustinov's Billy Budd (1962), and a strangely disorientating London in Otto Preminger's Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), for which Ashton was Bafta-nominated. Four years later, he won a well-deserved Bafta award for Richard Attenborough's Oh! What A Lovely War. Ashton cleverly matched Attenborough's theatrical interpretation of Joan Littlewood's first world war musical satire with stylised seaside-postcard sets, including the Brighton Pavilion and an old pier. He was Oscar-nominated for his last film, Attenborough's Young Winston (1973). </p> <p>Ashton was pleased to make his designs eye-catching, and was not ashamed to be noticed. According to one of his closest friends, Lady Havelock-Allan, widow of the film producer Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan, \"Don was one of the last great dandies. He loved beautiful clothes and wore them with huge panache and elegance. He was a man from another age, born out of his time, who brought a flash of colour into a sometimes grey world, and whose brilliant personal style was reflected in his designs for the screen.\" </p> <p>Ashton could certainly afford to dress well in keeping with his high life - driving a Rolls Royce and enjoying homes in Belgravia and in the country - before settling for almost 20 years in Hong Kong. Most of his money came from designing hotels. </p> <p>His first, the five-star Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong, was done as long ago as 1963. As the blurb puts it: \"The enjoyment of the hotel begins the moment you step into the lobby. You are welcomed in an atmosphere of Chinese antiques and subdued elegance. The ambience promises that you will feel truly at home during your stay.\" </p> <p>He went on to design a number of other Mandarin and Sheraton hotels around the world. Ironically, although these structures seem more permanent than his film designs, his vision of the bridge on the river Kwai may be more lasting. </p> <p>He is survived by his son, the film and television producer Paul Ashton, and two daughters from his first marriage, and a son and daughter by his second wife, who died earlier this year. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Donald Martin Ashton, art director and hotel designer, born June 26, 1919; died August 25 2004</p>",
  "Who's up and who's down as the Olympic Games reach their conclusion? We examine five of the main protagonists from the last fortnight in Athens, and assess their medal-winning credentials <p><b>Greece</b><br> </p> <p>As the organisers struggled to meet their Olympic deadlines, realists took comfort in the fact that as long the athletes were in the right place at the right time and the games looked good on TV, Athens 2004 would be deemed a success. </p> <p>In the end Greece achieved that and more. Schedules have run largely without delay, the athletes have heaped praised on the facilities and the village, and the city has been bequeathed a superb transport network. </p> <p>Set against those gains, the continued indifference of much of the public to sports in which Greeks are not involved has left the city short of atmosphere away from the venues. More than 2m tickets were unsold. The real test of Greek reaction to the games will come during the next 20 years as they struggle to meet the costs. The infrastructure spend is estimated at 7bn euros (34.7bn), and there is a danger that the games will be the first not to meet its operational costs since Moscow. The hangover will be painful. <b>Medal: Bronze</b> </p> <p><b>The Olympic movement</b><br> </p> <p>Every four years the Olympic Games demands the world's attention, and asks those who watch to believe that the values it claims to represent hold true. With each cycle however the creed of honest competition outlined by Baron de Coubertin at the games rebirth in Athens in 1896 seems harder to sustain. </p> <p>The seemingly endless stream of doping violations has created a hugely cynical environment in which no athlete is above suspicion, and no medal is truly celebrated until 48 hours have past with- out news of a positive test. </p> <p>But despite a running total of 18 positive tests, four of them affecting medallists, and the saga of Greek stars Kostas Kenteris and Ekatherina Thanou, cynicism has not yet doused the Olympic flame. In spite of the commercialism, the drugs and the politics, the games are still about the athletes first and foremost, and performances such as that produced by Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj, the greatest middle-distance runner of his generation, to win the 1,500 metres at the third attempt, have the power to sustain the quadrennial circus at least until it reaches Beijing. <b>Medal: Silver</b> </p> <p><b>Team GB</b><br> </p> <p>Before setting out for Athens the British Olympic Association set a modest target for Team GB of between seven and nine gold medals and a total of 25 of any colour. The caveat was that with the emergence of China and the increasing spread of competitive nations medals are getting harder to come by. </p> <p>Yesterday morning, with seven gold, eight silver and 11 bronze already in the bag and with runners Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe and boxer Amir Khan having power to add, team chiefs were quietly pleased. </p> <p>This is the second British summer Olympic team to have benefited from lottery funding distributed to elite athletes by UK Sport, whose own target was a 10th-place finish in the medal table (they stood 12th yesterday morning), and the signs are it is producing results. </p> <p>The majority of Team GB are full-time athletes, and they have clearly benefited from the BOA training camp established in Cyprus for a month before the games began. </p> <p>Cycling and sailing have excelled, swimming remains an underperforming part of the team, and there are concerns about where the track and field medals will come from in Beijing in four years time, but broadly the BOA can return home pleased. <b>Medal: Gold</b> </p> <p><b>London 2012 </b><br> </p> <p>The games could not have got off to a worse start for the aspirant hosts of the next-but-one summer games. Bid leader Lord Coe arrived in Athens to find most of his rivals already in place at the Athens Hilton, and making hay out of a Panorama expose of corrupt Olympic officials. The programme did not allege any wrongdoing on London's part, but the nuances were lost on many IOC members and the first week was spent fire-fighting among the 123-member electorate that will decide London's fate in July next year. </p> <p>Things have improved since. The bid's official presentation was well received by IOC members. Coe has been a positive and influential presence, and ambassadors such as Cherie Blair and the sports minister Richard Caborn have been smartly deployed to attend sports where there may not be a British interest, but London's interest can be boosted by an introduction to an influential IOC member. </p> <p>In an indication of how far London has to go to stand a chance of winning however, the bid team remain jumpy and prone to over-react to the sort of mixed publicity that Paris can afford to brush off with the insouciance of a worthy favourite. <b>Medal: Silver</b> </p> <p><b>Beijing </b><br> </p> <p>China has had an outstanding Olympics, and is already looking forward to its turn to host the games in four years. Its athletes had a record 54 medals yesterday morning, 25 gold. It represents a dramatic advance on the total of 28 won in Sydney four years ago, and the expectation is that it will be comfortably eclipsed in four years. </p> <p>From an organisational point of view the construction doubts that dogged Athens will not be a problem for Beijing. The IOC has already asked the Chinese to slow down once, so that its Olympic stadium was not completed before Athens, but with these games over Beijing is free to conclude its ambitious plans. </p> <p>The only cloud for the IOC is the raft of negative publicity and criticism that is likely to grow as the games come closer, largely because of the human rights abuses that continue to shame the Chinese state. <b>Medal: Gold</b></p>",
  "<p><strong> Bradley Wiggins</strong> </p> <p> Cyclist who won gold, silver and bronze medals </p> <p> The experience of Athens has been a dream come true for me. I prepared such a lot for the racing but nothing prepared me for having to cope with the emotional aftermath. At the moment I feel really confused. Matt Pinsent came down to see me win the bronze the other night and shake my hand. I know it sounds stupid but I just couldn't believe it. </p> <p>When I hear myself saying \"Bradley Wiggins, Olympic champion\", I have to shake myself and think, \"Is that really me?\" So I keep laughing and scratching my head saying that sounds too nice. People like Kelly Holmes have been trying to win for years. I'm only 24 - what do I do now? I think by Christmas I will be able to think straight. </p> <p>I'm on the Tour of GB next week, so I flew home yesterday before the closing ceremony. Because I've been in so many races, I wasn't able to see much live sport. But while you're in the village the Games are in your face 24/7. There's these 46 channels of just Olympic sport. Even in your bedroom, there's your GB kit to remind you of what's ahead. </p> <p>My highlight of the Games has definitely been the four's win. I would say that was the race of the Games across the board. </p> <p> <strong> Rick Dunn</strong> </p> <p> Rower in the men's pair </p> <p> For the first week we were out of the village and the Games had a completely different feel. To start with, there was so much pressure: four years of training and the worry of letting myself and others down. But then, as the week went on, I became more confident in what I could do. </p> <p>I told my Dad when he was dying of cancer that I would compete at the Olympics to show him that I could do something with my life. That's a big pressure. Just before we boated for the semi, my partner Toby Garbett pulled a sheet off the bow of our pair and revealed that he had painted \"David Dunn\", my dad's name, on the boat. I was overwhelmed: it was a very, very special moment. </p> <p>The second week of the Games has been one of the best weeks of my life. Lots of my friends and family have come out, I've got to see some amazing venues - Zorba the Greek clapping in the stadium has been a particular highlight and the friendship of other athletes has been just great. </p> <p>In the second week there are always great parties. Red Bull looked after us really well and the Sports Illustrated party was great. I've had the chance to drink with guys like Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett and they are really nice people, just normal guys who like to watch some sport, then party and dance like crazy. There's this mutual respect between all the athletes and, when I've been out of the village, lots of people have missed me. It's been great. </p> <p> <strong> Ian Turner</strong> </p> <p> Chief men's swimming team coach </p> <p> I'm now in Manchester, preparing for the short-course championships. It's hard for some of the swimmers who have not swum so well in Athens. But for me it's only now that I can begin to have some perspective on the Olympic experience. When you're out there as a coach the Olympics are not enjoyable. It's a job. You have to learn to keep your personality on a middle plane, even after a very good result, because the next one could be a massive disappointment. </p> <p>This is my fifth games and a meet like this has highs and lows like all the others I've been to. But there's no doubt that in swimming we've moved on considerably since Sydney. I know there were high expectations for us after the world championships last year but you just can't compare the Olympic experience with the worlds. </p> <p>For one thing, in the worlds we stay in the more controlled environment of a hotel. At the games the village is really a town. Afterwards it will consist of 20,000 people. Of course there are distractions: you can eat any food you want any time of the day and you see your heroes, like Ian Thorpe, in the dining hall practically every day. So getting yourself up to race them is a challenge. </p> <p>My games highlight was watching David Davies in the 1500m. He set the world alight with his heat. I'm not absolutely sure but I believe that only two men have swum under 15 minutes in both heat and final. We'd invested a lot in that boy. Bill Sweetenham had done well to get hold of the Aussie physiologist Bob Treffene to work with our distance swimmers and that paid off. </p> <p>The down side for me was the disappointment of James Goddard, who had silver or bronze written all over him after his semi. That expectation led him to change his tactics, which let him down in the last 25m. But I took a great deal of pleasure from the seventh place of my 4x200m relay team; they have come on so far. </p> <p> <strong> Beth Tweddle</strong> </p> <p> British gymnast </p> <p> Competing in the gymnastics was the highlight of my Olympics. On the team I did what I wanted. I can't be disappointed with my performance, only the result. The village is absolutely wicked and the atmosphere of Team GB is great. I'm used to being on a small team at world championships, so suddenly having athletes and swimmers around was amazing. </p> <p>The amount of people who have come up to me in the village and said 'I've seen your event and good luck' has been fantastic. I think these Games have been good. What's made them special is that all the Greek people have been so friendly. They will try and help us with almost anything that we ask. I've been very busy trading pins, which you get asked for loads out here. </p> <p>I'm really looking forward to the closing ceremony and in the gymnastics team now we're trying on the outfits we have to wear. Before the games I thought this would be my one and only Olympics. Now I'm not sure; it feels like there's unfinished business. My coach has said what about Beijing 2008? So at the moment I'm giving my future some thought. </p> <p> <strong> Dr Richard Budgett</strong> </p> <p> Chief medical officer of the BOA. </p> <p> I've been impressed and pleasantly surprised by the quality of these games. The stadiums are fantastic. During the second week, when my family has been out here, I've been able to experience the games from the point of view of a punter rather than a doctor and I have to say that the transport system has been wonderful. The new trains are fantastic and the stations very clean and impressive - much better than the London Underground. </p> <p>My highlight of the Games has been that wonderful day out on Lake Schinias. To be up there on such a perfect day at such a beautiful venue was just incredible. Apart from that, one of the most exciting things I've seen was the badminton final. Team GB didn't get the result they wanted but it was so close and exciting and the atmosphere in the hall was great. </p> <p>On the down side, the numbers watching have been a little disappointing. I don't think that's been down to the price of tickets, which seems reasonable. Possibly it's down to the cost of accommodation here, which is very expensive. </p> <p> <strong> Alison Williamson</strong> </p> <p> Britain's bronze medal-winning archer </p> <p> At the three Olympics I have been to before I bought myself a memento. The other day I thought about what I was going to buy this time and then I realised I do not need to - I have it in my drawer, an Olympic medal. </p> <p>It was fantastic for the event to have been in the Panathinaiko Stadium. It was a wonderful venue, visually and with all the history, and the other night we were on a bus driving past there at night and we said 'there it is, our stadium'. One of the things I have noticed more about life in the village than at previous games has been the camaraderie. </p> <p>You could see it in the way that, before my competition, team managers and support staff from other Team GB events would come up and wish me well. It was a team spirit that was generated from the holding camp in Cyprus. I have had such a good time. </p> <p> <strong> Donovan Bailey</strong> </p> <p> Canada's 1996 Olympic 100m champion </p> <p> I have seen the Olympics from the \"other side\" working for television. I am in the studio with CBC and have been doing live and studio stuff with Eurosport. I have had a great time; I have to say it has not been a bad gig. </p> <p>I worked with the media at last year's world championships in Paris but people have been asking me, \"Do I miss being out there?\" I don't. I achieved everything I wanted to, I still have the Olympic 100m record - though I thought it was going to go this time - and I am happy. I spend much of my time in the mixed zone, seeing it from the media side when the athletes come off the track, commenting live on what they have just done. </p> <p> <strong> Abi Oyepitan</strong> </p> <p> Britain's 200m finalist; she was equal seventh </p> <p> All my life I have been dreaming about the Olympic final and, when I walked out for the 200m, it was hard to take in that I was there. That is the moment I will remember most, seeing all those people cheering and I felt quite overwhelmed. </p> <p>In fact, I felt like crying such were my emotions and I decided not to look at the crowd and to concentrate on what was ahead. I will learn much from my races here in the 100m and 200m and know I do not need to be nervous. I cannot wait for Beijing in four years' time. Being at the Olympics has been wonderful. I have been sharing an apartment with seven other members of the British team - Denise Lewis, Joice Maduaka, Donna Fraser, Jo Fenn, Catherine Murphy, Sarah Claxton and Christine Ohuruogu - and we have had some great fun.</p>",
  "<p>Kelly Holmes will be able to claim officially she is Britain's greatest ever female athlete if she completes the double by winning the 1500 metres in the Olympic Stadium here today. </p> <p>In the 108-year history of the games no British woman has won more than one gold medal. In fact, the only British athlete to win two titles at the same Olympics is Albert Hill, who completed the same 800m-1500m double in Antwerp 84 years ago. </p> <p>The ridiculous ease with which Holmes qualified for the final on Thursday must have confirmed her rivals' fears that she is operating on a different plane. Her confidence has soared since she won the 800m on Monday. </p> <p>\"There is no other runner in her class,\" said Ian Hodge, the official statistician for UK Athletics. \"She will be running with all the confidence in the world. </p> <p>\"The only way I can see her losing is if she makes a mistake. But the way she is running I cannot see that happening.\" </p> <p>Holmes, however, has suffered too many disappointments too often - it was five months ago she fell in the 1500m final at the world indoor championships in Budapest - to take anything for granted. </p> <p>\"Myself and my coach always study my opponents,\" she said. \"We look at their past and current form and what they're capable of. You basically know how the top runners are going to approach the race. </p> <p>\"But you have to try and find your own strengths and adjust them to how you think the race is going to go. </p> <p>\"The big race nerves start to build when I'm warming up. And they get even worse just before I pull up to the starting line. </p> <p>\"Sometimes when I walk out on to the track I think: 'What am I doing here? Why do I put myself through this?' </p> <p>\"But that's when you really get into your focus. You think about all the things that are pre-set in your mind and focus on the race you're going to run.\" </p> <p>Holmes has already made one small piece of history by becoming the first runner in the Olympics to reach the final of both the 800m and 1500m in three consecutive games. </p> <p>But victory today would represent a massive achievement that should turn her into a worldwide superstar. </p> <p>When Hill returned from Antwerp in 1920 he resumed his job on the railways. Holmes could expect to become a millionaire overnight. </p> <p>Both Hill and Holmes served in the army, although Hill had little choice due to being conscripted to the Royal Flying Corps for the first world war, and both were considered to be past their peak as athletes when they achieved their greatest success. Hill was 31, Holmes is 34. </p> <p>It was also far from certain before Antwerp that Hill would run in both events, a scenario similar to that of Holmes. He had to argue with the selectors to be given the opportunity to double up after being hampered by an injury. </p> <p>Hill magnificently defied the critics who had written him off after the war. He ran seven races in eight days in Antwerp and slept for most of the rest of the time. Holmes's race today will be her sixth in nine days. </p> <p>Hill justified the selectors' faith and won both the 800m and 1500m. Like Holmes he won the shorter race only in the last few strides before adding the 1500m title 48 hours later. </p> <p>Sam Mussabini, the Italian coach immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire, coached Hill. Holmes must sometimes believe she is starring in her own movie, so improbable have this week's events been. </p> <p><strong>British medal hopes</strong></p> <p><strong>Golden hopes </strong></p> <p>Kelly Holmes 1500m, 6.30pm today</p> <p>Amir Khan Lightweight boxing, 12.40pm tomorrow</p> <p><strong>Good prospects</strong></p> <p>Pete Waterfield 10m diving, from 10am today</p> <p>Sarah Stevenson Taekwondo heavyweight, from 9.10am tomorrow</p> <p><strong>Outside hopes</strong></p> <p>Ian Wynne Men's K1 500m, 6.30am today</p> <p>Liam Killeen Men's mountain biking, from 9am today</p> <p>Jon Brown Marathon, from 4pm tomorrow</p>"
