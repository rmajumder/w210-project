  "The events of the past five days in Russia have brought an international response of solidarity with the people of Beslan, a blasted place of 35,000 souls whose emotions at this time can hardly be guessed at. The images of dead children in bodybags touch the very heart of what it means to be human and what it means when that humanity is so unforgivably taken away. <p>The massacre at School Number 1 immediately raises many complex questions. But before considering those, we should take time to pause and remember the lives of those killed and maimed by the terrorists and of the thousands of lives that will be indelibly touched by their dreadful actions. </p> <p>Yesterday, Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, said that he considered the event a declaration of 'full-scale war' against his nation. But depraved terrorism of this type does not come unannounced. Russian forces fighting the two wars in Chechnya have distinguished themselves with their own brand of brutality - killing, torturing, maiming and kidnapping with equal abandon and disregard for the rule of law. </p> <p>Putin's policy of a draconian crackdown and his failure to even countenance a limited degree of self-determination in some parts of the Caucasus has been a policy doomed to fail. He has become a recruiting sergeant for terrorists and an excuse for those with the darkest of motives to hitch a ride on the feelings of powerlessness among the people of the region. </p> <p>Putin represents Russia's instinctive reflexes towards Chechnya and the increasingly lawless and brutal society that Russia has become.Yesterday, he admitted that his nation had failed to keep up with a changing world and that its unreformed security services had been unable to dam the nation's porous borders. Terrorism flourishes in such circumstances. </p> <p>Russia is a country where journalists critical of the government are shot by gunmen who the authorities make no attempt to bring to justice, and where businessmen can be held in prison on trumped-up charges if they are suspected of supporting the opposition. The much criticised weakness of the Russian security forces in organising themselves to avoid a bloodbath in Beslan, significantly admitted as a failure by Putin, results, in part, from Russia's attempt to insulate itself from external criticism. </p> <p>The instinct of Western leaders like Tony Blair and George Bush is to stand with Putin, and portray Chechnya as part of the seamless war on terrorism. It is true there are points of intersection. Chechnya informs the anger of many of the jihadist groups. Saudi money, too, has financed Chechen fighters. Some radicals see Chechnya as the new Afghanistan. But there are critical differences. </p> <p>The troubles of Chechnya predate 11 September. The ongoing deadlock, together with Putin's prosecution of the continuing war, contributes to, rather than results from, the global terror crisis. That is why any resolution needs to be internationalised, involving not just Russia and Chechnya, but possibly also the Organisation Security and Co-operation in Europe. Until now, Moscow has resisted any such suggestion and yesterday Putin was understandably talking tough. But the decision by local leaders to talk to Aslan Maskhadov's separatists to try and negotiate an end to the Beslan crisis, apparently approved by the Kremlin, suggests there is room for talks that Russia has to date ruled out. </p> <p>The thugs around the Chechen terrorist leader, Shamil Basayev, need to be isolated; the money trail needs to be out in the open and the Saudis confronted with their responsibility. The Russians need to concede that, without a willingness to negotiate, the crisis will deepen. And Europe has to help foster change. More of the same will mean more Beslans - more traumas for Russia and further horrors for the rest of the world.</p>",
  "Europe's show of unity with Vladimir Putin was shattered yesterday when Russia accused the European Union of 'blasphemy' for demanding an explanation of how the Beslan school hostage crisis ended in massacre. <p>With many EU governments uneasy about President Putin's hard line on Chechnya, relations turned sour when Bernard Bot, the Dutch Foreign Minister, raised questions about Russia's handling of the stand-off with Chechen gunmen. His country currently holds the EU presidency. </p> <p>Other EU leaders sought to paper over the cracks, with Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of Germany condemning the terrorists as wholly responsible for the bloodshed. </p> <p>In Britain, a Government spokesman said: 'This is the moment for condolences for the Russian people.' </p> <p>But in an interview to be broadcast by GMTV this morning, Michael Howard, the Tory leader, calls for the creation of a minister of homeland security to prevent a copycat atrocity here. </p> <p>Bot sparked the diplomatic row in a statement made for the EU presidency on Friday, when children's bodies were still being recovered from the school in southern Russia. </p> <p>He said all countries should work together to stop such atrocities, but added: 'We also would like to know from the Russian authorities how this tragedy could have happened.' </p> <p>Bot, hosting an EU meeting in the Netherlands, added: 'It is very difficult to judge from a distance whether the right decision was taken or not. But the authorities have done their utmost to find a solution through negotiations.' The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking from Cairo, reacted with outrage. 'In a situation when the whole world knew that the main priority was saving children, and that there would be no storming, to hear such words from a minister seems to us to be blasphemy.' </p> <p>In Moscow, Lavrov's deputy Boris Chizhov called in the Dutch ambassador, Tiddo Hofstee, to demand an explanation for Bot's words. </p> <p>A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman defended Bot: 'Because of the large number of casualties, in order to understand better what happened, he'd like information about what happened. He did not say the Russians did something wrong. The Russian government has taken this like a criticism, which was not the intention of the minister.' </p> <p>At the EU meeting, Irish foreign minister Brian Cowen said it would be 'a very premature and wrong judgment' to fault the Russian security forces. But diplomats said the former Soviet republic Latvia told the meeting it should react more strongly to Russian handling of the end of the siege. </p> <p>Schr\u00f6der, emerging from a cabinet meeting in Bonn, said: 'The unscrupulous terrorists carry the responsibility. I don't believe that you can talk with terrorists who would shoot fleeing children in the back.' </p> <p>Interpol said its global communications network and databases on fingerprints, stolen travel documents, DNA and other data were available to Russiato help determine whether the militants were linked to international terrorists. </p> <p>At the Vatican, the Pope condemned the attack as a 'vile and ruthless aggression on defenceless children and families,' and offered his 'heartfelt affection to the Russian people in this hour of dismay and anguish.'</p>",
  "I get the feeling that, in the latter half of the last century, a planner was perched in the Scottish Office intent on bridging every estuary and cove around the coast of Scotland. <p>Growing up in Sutherland, I remember the journey south becoming ever shorter. First there was the low sweep of tarmac across the Cromarty Firth, then the high wire act of the Kessock Bridge. </p> <p>With those complete, the planner seemed to move into the wilderness. There was the Kylesku Bridge, opened by the Queen (who didn't use it, but instead motored up the sea loch in the royal yacht). Then a span across the Dornoch Firth, robbing several villages of tourists. Finally, the controversial Skye Bridge shifted the westernmost point of the mainland from Ardnamurchan to Neist. </p> <p>Having run out of unbridged gaps, the planner began to panic. Ten years ago, he (I assume, he) decided to start building second bridges across already covered waters, starting with a \u00a3500,000 plan for a new road bridge across the Firth of Forth. He was scuppered only with the dawn of the New Labour government in 1997. </p> <p>That was then; now the plan is back.Yesterday the road bridge turned 40, and it is showing the signs of mid-life crisis.The engineers who built it, spoke of a capacity of 11 million cars a year. This seemed plenty when 4m cars travelled its length in its first year, but no longer. Last year's figure was 24m. As a result, the bridge has spent much of this year being renovated. </p> <p>This plan for a second crossing has been resurrected in a strategy document from the Forth Estuary Transport Authority, a cheesily acronymed body that runs the existing road bridge. This time it is couched in broader terms. FETA foresees a structure that carries a tram, has dedicated bus and car-share lanes, and even a new train line. This would be a new, touchy-feely road bridge, and one which would cost a mere \u00a31 billion. </p> <p>Much of the noise about the need for a second bridge has come from the north bank. For Fife, the crossing is crucial, a route out which businesses need in order to flourish. </p> <p>It's easy to understand the Kingdom's nervousness given we are a country with a tendency to always look south for the money. For the businesses north of the Forth, the road bridge looks a very thin umbilical indeed. </p> <p>So to some extent, FETA is right. If the rift between the central belt and the north is to be healed then strong links need to run across the Forth/Clyde divide.Yet, cars are just an easy answer, and the wrong one. We were reminded last month that global warming may be creeping up on us, and not with the balmy weather we all used to joke about. Rather roads are being washed away by landslips in flash-floods. If ever there was a bad example to set, it would surely be building a new road bridge. </p> <p>The idea of adding a train line is also deeply worrying. There is already a rail bridge spanning the gap. Offering any alternative to the people who have to maintain the Forth Rail Bridge would be a travesty, because they would immediately try to shrug off the expense of maintaining this hugely important monument to our 19th century engineers. The moment the rail bridge becomes no more than a museum piece, will be the end of it. </p> <p>Our whole attitude towards the Forth Estuary needs to change. Stand at the top of Edinburgh's George Street, and you can look out at the towns that line the other bank. I once tried to bribe a fisherman to ferry me from Pittenweem to North Berwick, but the man thought I was mad, which seemed a bit rich given he had bits of crab in his beard. The two banks shouldn't be see each other in such opposition. Instead the water should be considered more like that of Sydney Harbour, or the bay around Manhattan. </p> <p>There are plans being considered by Brian Souter, owner of Stagecoach, to start operating ferries between Edinburgh and towns like Burntisland, Kinghorn and Kirkcaldy. This seems a very good idea, and one worth pushing. The benefits to both banks would be immense. It would be truly wonderful to see commuter ferries plying their trade across the water. </p> <p>The train lines north also need to be improved. This is an old, dull cry but at the moment the system seems odd, old-fashioned and illogical. Often a trip to Perth is like a jaunt round the Fife peninsula. Which is fine for those who live in Leuchars, but irritating if speed is important. </p> <p>It also makes for an easy decision if your choice of transport from Perth to Edinburgh is a 45 minute drive or a 75 minute train journey (at the very least). Go further than that and the times become monstrous: three and a half hours from Inverness, eight hours to get from Wick. </p> <p>FETA says that a quarter of the cars crossing the bridge head to points west, so that its plans are not just about commuters. But that is just another reason for a new planner in the new Scottish Executive to tackle the problem with a passion that matches that earlier bridge-building fanatic. </p> <p>If the rail network could be made to match the road system, then the Forth's rail bridge would be secure, there would be no need for a second bridge, the country would seem more whole, and Scotland would be a healthier place. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com\">ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com</a></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ruaridh Nicoll's latest novel, Wide Eyed, is published in paperback by Black Swan, \u00a36.99</p>",
  "Animal rights activists have vowed to launch at least 10 'terror attacks' a night across Britain, The Observer can reveal. <p>As hundreds of extremists from across the world gathered at a training camp in Kent today to learn direct-action tactics, the ultra-hardline wing of the movement warned the UK to brace itself for a sharp escalation in violent activity. </p> <p>The 3,000 members of the Animal Liberation Front, a shadowy umbrella group for various terrorist cells, have drawn up a list of 'legitimate targets' including circuses, farms and zoos to the staff of companies and suppliers involved in animal vivisection. Attacks could vary from arson to obscene graffiti. </p> <p>An ALF source said: 'Ten attacks a night would be an absolute minimum. Think of the number of butcher shops: at least a couple of windows are already being broken every night and then you have people spraying graffiti on cars to those targeting employees of Huntingdon Life Sciences.' </p> <p>Although organisers of the training camp near Tonbridge insist they are promoting only legal forms of protest, Ronnie Lee, founder of the ALF, was yesterday addressing hundreds of supporters at the site. His comments were followed last night by an address from another high-profile and equally controversial figure, Jerry Vlasak, the American surgeon who has argued that violence is 'morally justifiable'. Vlasak's speech however was carried via video-link from the US after the Home Secretary, David Blunkett last month banned him from entering Britain because of his 'dangerous' views. </p> <p>Despite claims by organisers of the international gathering of animal protesters that they are not condoning violence, sceptics are concerned those attending are being taught how to handle police interviews and life in jail. 'This gives you a chance to prepare and make mistakes in a safe environment,' promised a leaflet. </p> <p>Some medical researchers fear workshops on how to maximise the effectiveness of protests are thinly veiled lessons in extremism. Their concerns follow a sharp rise in attacks by animal rights activists during the past 10 days. There have been at least six serious incidents, including the spraying with graffiti of the home of a GlaxoSmithKline employee in west London. Days earlier cars were attacked belonging to people connected with a guinea pig farm in Newchurch while three further attacks on the property of people linked to Huntingdon Life Sciences, which uses animals for research, have also been reported. </p> <p>Robert Cogswell of Speak, the group leading a campaign to halt construction of an animal research laboratory at Oxford University, is among a growing number of leading figures in the movement who told The Observer they do not condone violence. He is among those that blame the failure of Labour to deliver on animal welfare issues for helping to foster a climate of protests. </p> <p>Threats of an upsurge in sustained action will alarm the government. A campaign of violence and intimidation by Shac against Huntingdon Life Sciences forced the firm to move its headquarters to the US. Spiralling security costs meanwhile meant Cambridge University abandoned plans to build a primate research facility. Oxford University has been seeking a new builder for two months after the original contractors were targeted by ALF members. </p> <p>Police from the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit have announced they are keeping a close observation on any illegal activity such as workshops that incite violence. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.townsend@observer.co.uk\">mark.townsend@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Heads of security services and governments around the world have something in common with Osama bin Laden. They all stand to benefit from exaggerating the capabilities of al-Qaeda. <p>The idea that bin Laden is a global terrorist mastermind, able to engender violence worldwide, flatters him and helps in the competition with other terrorist outfits for recruits and funds. The benefits of myth-making are also clear to the Russians (and the Uzbeks, Filipinos and Algerians, to name but three serial human-rights abusing governments who constantly claim, disingenuously, that the insurgents that they are fighting in their respective lands are linked to 'al-Qaeda'). </p> <p>Active participation in the 'war against terror' triggers a flood of material and moral support from Washington as well as legitimising tactics the West otherwise wouldn't approve of. It means long-term grudges underpinning any insurgency - discrimination, economic mismanagement, repression - can be ignored and the 'al-Qaeda bogeyman' blamed instead. </p> <p>So it is unsurprising Russian security services have, on the basis of 10 'citizens of the Arab world' being among 20 militants killed in the hostage siege last week, decided that the operation was the work of 'al-Qaeda'. </p> <p>We must be wary. It is true that Chechen warlord Khattab, a Jordanian-born militant leader killed in 2002, met bin Laden while both men were fighting the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan but there is no evidence that Khattab joined his group. </p> <p>Thousands of militants fought the Soviets; only a handful established links with al-Qaeda. </p> <p>A second point is that Chechen militants' main conduit for cash appears to have been a Saudi charity that is part of the royal establishment. Rich Saudis donate huge sums to a whole range of Islamic militants and groups, not just al-Qaeda. A link to Saudi funding is not a link to bin Laden. </p> <p>And individuals connected to 9/11 were indeed planning to travel to Chechnya. But so were most of the thousands of young men who travelled to Afghanistan to get military training between 1993 and 2001. Chechnya has become - like Kashmir, Palestine and Afghanistan - a rallying call for Muslims worldwide. The violence there is held as evidence that the Islamic world is under attack by belligerent Christians. To believe this does not make you 'al-Qaeda'. </p> <p>Finally, it is often claimed that hundreds of Chechen militants have fought alongside al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. In fact, most are Uzbeks or Tajiks; very few are from the Caucasus. </p> <p>Last week's atrocity was not the work of 'al-Qaeda'. It is a result however of the spread of 'al-Qaeda-ism' and, in particular, the ability of the radical new discourse to 'plug into' existing insurgencies, many of which were nationalist or ethnic to start with but have become Islamicised. By misrepresenting the problem, we make the solution harder to find. </p> <p>The greatest hope is the horrified reaction of the world's moderate Muslims - the vast majority. The increasing brutality of the militants will undercut their support and eventually isolate them. But this is a long process and the West is doing precious little to expedite it. </p> <p><i>Jason Burke's Al-Qaeda: The True Story of Radical Islam was published in paperback by Penguin last month.</i></p>",
  "<p>If there is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at Sainsbury's this weekend, it is hardly surprising. The share price shot up last Thursday on heavy trading as bid rumours swirled. Was it Philip Green, fresh from his Marks &amp; Spencer defeat, turning his billion-pound gun back towards Holborn? </p> <p>Well, no. Green went on record to say the speculation was 'rubbish'. He added: 'I've been back in the UK for 48 hours [after an extended summer holiday] and haven't talked to anyone.' </p> <p>Since it emerged during the M&amp;S wrangle that Green had approached Peter Davis about Sainsbury's last year his name has been added to the list of interested parties. </p> <p>Sources close to Sainsbury's say that if Green is interested it is more likely to be as a clothing supplier. The logic would be that he could expand sales beyond his bricks-and-mortar empire - including Top Shop, Bhs and Dorothy Perkins - without acquiring a whole new business to do it. After all, it never did George Davies any harm at M&amp;S. </p> <p>But, in the short-term, shareholders may be looking hopefully elsewhere for somebody to take the business off their hands. </p> <p>This newspaper revealed last month that executives from Target, the number two American discount retailer after Wal-Mart, had a meeting at Sainsbury's Holborn headquarters. Retail sources say the Target teams, who visited the UK once earlier this year and once last year, appeared to know Sainsbury's well and expressed regret that they had missed out on Safeway. </p> <p>Target has so far declined to comment, and Sainsbury's has denied that any deal talks have taken place. </p> <p>Sainsbury's itself has grown used to spikes in the share price and is well-practised at the standard response: 'We do not comment on bid speculation.' </p> <p>What was interesting about last week's squeeze on the stock was that it did not drop right back on Friday following Green's denial. </p> <p>As with Marks &amp; Spencer there are plenty of retail experts queuing up to explain why Sainsbury's is a difficult target. At the top of the list is the role of the Sainsbury family, which controls almost 35 per cent of the stock. If they do not wish to sell, it cannot be sold. </p> <p>Then there is the size of the business, valued at about \u00a34.6 billion, and its leasehold liability, which makes gearing the business more difficult. </p> <p>Add in the competitive supermarket sector, with the Tesco juggernaut seemingly unstoppable and Asda backed by mighty Wal-Mart, and the argument goes that it would be a brave soul who thought they could make good money out of Sainsbury's. </p> <p>Interest might come from America, although the recent mergers and acquisitions track record - Wal-Mart/Asda aside - shows that straight retail acquisitions tend to be relatively tiny. This year, Whole Foods of Austin, Texas bought organic chain Fresh &amp; Wild in January, and Borders book chain bought Paperchase in July. According to M&amp;A data experts Zephyr, of more than 30,000 M&amp;A deals done by US companies in Britain in the past four years, just over 100 were in the retail sector. </p> <p>Christopher Lewey, of Close Brothers Corporate Finance, said: 'Most retailers are not international businesses. Consumers differ from country to country, except possibly in the basic food and discount end of the market. In terms of private equity interest, most of the low-hanging fruit has already been taken in the UK during the past four or five years. There is probably more downside in UK retail now than upside.' </p> <p>The chief interest is in 'big box' retailing, says America's Retail Industry Leaders' Association, a trade organisation. 'UK retailing has relatively fewer hypermarkets, \"category killers\" or discount format stores [than the US],' says a spokeswoman. 'The lack of a true, deep-discount sector in UK food retailing or price-focused, large format makes it appealing. </p> <p>'Some consumer studies we have seen on shopping behaviour in the UK show that consumers favour one-stop shopping that is convenient. A number of our US operators have business models that are quite good at this. Although the costs [property, rent, transportation and logistics] can be higher, there are also similarities between the US and UK operational and regulatory environment. We have a shared language, a similar culture both from a consumer standpoint and an employee standpoint, and the UK can, and is often, used as an entry point into the rest of Europe.' </p> <p>American institution KKR was known to have been interested in Safeway, but has no interest in Sainsbury's at present. It is one of the few finance providers that could combine its US and European funds to raise the kind of money needed to buy Sainsbury's. </p> <p>UK analysts say it would take a consortium of four or five venture capital companies to buy the chain because no one fund would be able to raise the equity. Permira, for example, has just raised its fourth European fund of \u20ac5bn. </p> <p>Nathan Self, of CSFB, said: 'You are more likely to see a pack of jackals dragging down a dying wildebeest than a lion killing it off quickly.' </p> <p>If nobody can pinpoint the source of last week's surge of interest, it is at least easy to see why Sainsbury's is regarded by many as a target. It issued a dire profits warning in July. New chief executive Justin King has promised to present a rescue plan on 19 October, a day that is shaping up to be almost as significant as 12 July was for Stuart Rose at M&amp;S. </p> <p>The signs are that what he has found so far has not been good. Last week Sainsbury's announced the departure of Martin White, the man in charge of the \u00a3400 million splurge on a new distribution network. To replace him comes Lawrence Christensen, ex-Safeway, who hits retirement age in 16 months' time. </p> <p>That Sainsbury's is a basket case is disputed by few. Analyst David Stoddart of Teather &amp; Greenwood said he would be astonished if anybody wanted it. 'It's a bit like your mother knocking a pan of boiling water off a stove and telling you to catch it,' he said, also pointing to the strength of competition from Tesco and Asda. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has been careful not to promise a quick fix for profits: the drive to increase sales has already demanded price cuts on the shop floor - and they cost money. </p> <p>Unless and until King can show how the core supermarket chain can increase profits, however, Sainsbury's will continue to be everybody's favourite retail target rumour.</p>",
  "There is something rather humiliating about the admiration gushing visibly from France's finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy towards Tom Cruise in the pictures released after a peculiar hour-long summit this week between the politician and film star. <p>Sarkozy is too awestruck to remember to look dignified and is smiling with embarrassing enthusiasm. No politician can look handsome when he is standing next to an A-list Hollywood actor, and the juxtaposition of the two men is unkind. Sarkozy even looks shorter than the famously tiny Cruise. </p> <p>But in the glamour-free world of French politics, Sarkozy is an action hero in his own right. Relentlessly energetic and constantly promoting his mission to save the nation, France's former 'premier flic' (top cop) clearly identifies with Cruise. His announcement on Wednesday that he will run for the leadership of France's ruling centre-right political party, the UMP, marks a crucial step in his unstoppable campaign to rise to the summit of French politics and seize the presidency from Jacques Chirac in 2007. He is certain to win the UMP leadership race, and with the party as his launchpad, Sarkozy, France's most popular politician, is in a powerful position to shape the post-Chirac era of French politics. </p> <p>Particularly gratifying for the finance minister was the President's decision to approve his candidacy, calling a temporary ceasefire to the feud between the elder statesman and his treacherous former protege which has animated French political life for years. Sarkozy's announcement was greeted by the President with friendly, but ultimately hollow, promises of support. </p> <p>Some analysts speculate that Chirac is gambling that his finance minister, who will have to give up his ministerial post once he begins the campaign, will drift into oblivion, swallowed up by the tedium of party electioneering. Chirac could then stand for a third presidential term in 2007 or manoeuvre his chosen successor into the post, thus preserving his political legacy. These are feeble hopes. Sarkozy has been planning his route to power for the past 25 years. Now he is gearing up for the final stages, which promise to be characterised by the hyperactive drive and unblushing ambition that have driven his career so far. </p> <p>BORN IN 1955 in Paris, Sarkozy's father was a Hungarian aristocrat who had come to France as a refugee. His mother worked as a lawyer. Their son plunged himself into politics at a precocious age, and was active in the Gaullist party's youth movement as a teenager. </p> <p>Chirac, then prime minister, spotted the young law student's talents at a conference in 1976 and invited him to Paris. Sarkozy swiftly made himself indispensable to the prime minister, who adopted him as a family friend and began grooming him for power. </p> <p>Their friendship was as powerful as their enmity has now become, and for a while it looked as if Chirac had found his successor. With Chirac's support a meteoric rise began, and in 1983, at 28, Sarkozy was elected France's youngest mayor, in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly. </p> <p>Two events destroyed his position as Chirac's spiritual son. The first, a little talked about extra-marital romance with the President's daughter Claude, which turned the first lady, Bernadette, resolutely against her husband's protege. The second was his decision in 1995 to support a rival right-wing presidential candidate, Edouard Balladur, against Chirac. </p> <p>For three years the men did not speak, but Chirac has subsequently been forced to tolerate Sarkozy, who is an irreplaceable electoral asset for the right. After a series of dismal results in regional and European polls earlier this year, and with the former UMP leader Alain Jupp\u00e9 convicted of corruption, the party needs him desperately. </p> <p>Where there was once affection, now there is scarcely disguised animosity and their simmering venom explodes periodically into bouts of spiteful backbiting. Chirac lets it be know that Sarkozy's 'insolence' exasperates him and has done his best to frustrate his ambitions, promoting the perennially unpopular, but much more biddable, Jean-Pierre Raffarin over him to prime minister in 2002. </p> <p>The thin coating of courtesy cracked spectacularly during the president's Bastille Day interview this year. On live television he lashed out with casual contempt: 'There is no disagreement with Mr Sarkozy for one simple reason. I decide; he carries out my orders.' </p> <p>But despite these attempts to squash him, Sarkozy's popularity ratings inch ever higher. 'The more they attack me, the more I advance,' he says. </p> <p>Sarkozy hits back in his own style. Colleagues have heard him berate those who disagree with him, muttering: 'You're as stupid as Chirac.' His message is simple: after 35 years at the summit of French politics, Chirac, 71, is past his sell by date. </p> <p>'In politics, you have to know when it is time to give up your place,' he said in a television interview. Asked whether he liked to fantasise about being president when he shaves every morning, he replied: 'Yes, and not only when I'm shaving.' </p> <p>His best response to the humiliation of the Bastille Day remarks was an eight-page Hello!- style interview given to Paris Match . Photographs showed Sarkozy, 49, jogging with his wife along a sandy beach, and playing football (in strangely inappropriate slip-on shoes) with his son. </p> <p>The effect was to remind readers that he is the younger, more energetic figure. His dynamism is a powerful tool at a time when political commentators are whispering that they think Chirac may be going deaf. </p> <p>Hyperactivity has become his trademark, causing tensions with some of his cabinet colleagues, put to shame by his unstoppable drive. His bizarre notion of what constitutes a summer holiday is to move with his family to a quiet seaside resort, invite key members of his political entourage to join him, hold daily press conferences and pose occasionally for photos, looking almost relaxed on a bicycle. The worst that rivals can say is: 'Sarkozy does too much. That's his achilles heel.' </p> <p>When he was appointed interior minister in 2002 he got over his disappoint ment at not getting the top job by racing around France, meeting firemen and police officers, tracking Corsican terrorists, comforting victims of national tragedy. Accompanied everywhere by a pack of journalists, his efforts were recorded nightly on the nation's news bulletins. </p> <p>Sarkozy has a populist touch. He does not come from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration - which traditionally trains France's senior public servants - and his language is consequentially more straightfoward than that of his rivals. </p> <p>An early piece of legislation for which he was responsible as interior minister banned flag-burning and booing during the Marseillaise. He is an accomplished networker. The fact that it was Cruise who requested this private meeting reflects this ability to spin a global web of contacts. </p> <p>His move to the finance ministry has denied him many of these photo opportunities. Jealous colleagues (of whom there are many) speculated this week that he would be grinding his teeth at having no role to play in the government's attempts to liberate the two French hostages from Iraq. Sarkozy thrives on crisis and as a young politician helped negotiate the release of school-children taken hostage in Neuilly. </p> <p>His centre-right politics are pragmatic. As interior minister he successfully seized ground from the National Front by talking tough on crime. He admires Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and would like to see France improve relations with Britain and America. He believes affirmative action is the way to help France's excluded minorities into the mainstream. </p> <p>He describes himself as a liberal reformer, believes in deregulation of the state, favours cutting taxes and wants to get rid of the 35 hour week. 'I don't care about ideology. I do what works,' he says. </p> <p>Sarkozy has more battles ahead before the 2007 elections. In the Elys\u00e9e palace, presidential aides talk of a policy known as TSS - tout sauf Sarkozy (anyone but Sarkozy) - and despite his professions of support, Chirac is thought to be preparing his new interior minister Dominque de Villepin for greater power. </p> <p>But the finance minister has developed a skin tough enough shield him against future attacks from his boss.

  "<p>As a boy he was a bookworm who built toy ships and planes and wanted to be an astronaut. As a student he got through three universities in five years and never managed to graduate. To many, the bespectacled, robot-collecting Will Wright is the ultimate geeks' geek. But he is also acclaimed as a genius in his field, and a multi-millionaire whose fortune is about to become even greater. </p> <p>Wright, 44, is the brains behind The Sims, the most popular personal computer game ever, having sold, with its predecessor SimCity, a combined 37 million copies. Effectively granting you licence to play God, it is one of the few titles to have reached beyond the hardcore gaming community to strike a chord with women, gay men and others with little time for dungeons or dragons. For this reason millions around the world are bristling with excitement at the prospect of Wright's long awaited sequel, The Sims 2, later this month. </p> <p>The Sims is a real-time strategy game where players create and furnish an average house while looking after the needs of a virtual family. Unlike the typical video game formula of death and destruction, The Sims is based on the minutiae of daily suburban life and can be as engrossing as soap operas or Big Brother. Among unlikely addicts was the writer Fay Weldon, who has observed: 'Such stubborn suburbanites, those Sims, those simulacra, how they shook their tiny fists at you if you interfered with their parties, their affairs. How you struggled with them, the families of your own creation, against disaster, debt, child neglect, the interference of social workers - shortage of time and money the great enemy.' </p> <p>The Sims 2, released on 17 September, allows players to direct the Sims as they pass on genetic traits from one generation to the next, witness their life-changing moments from cradle to grave and make movies about them, creating the cast, operating the camera and writing the screenplay. An early review in PC Gamer magazine praised its vastly improved graphics and gave it a 92 per cent rating. </p> <p>The game looks set to crown the career of Wright, arguably the most important visionary in computer gaming's short history. He is to aficionados what Matt Groening is to devotees of The Simpsons, which also happens to be one of Wright's favourite TV shows. He lives in a mansion commanding magnificent views of the Californian hills north of San Francisco where he indulges nerdish passions such as robotics. </p> <p>Such fortune barely seemed likely for a small town boy growing up in Georgia, the son of a chemical engineer and theatre actress. When Wright was nine his father died, and he moved with his mother and sister to Louisiana. </p> <p>After school he bounced from one college to another, variously studying architecture, mechanical engineering and aviation, earning a pilot's licence but never lasting the course. Then he discovered computers and, at 22, created his first game for the Commodore 64. For his next, he drew on the work of a sociologist who modelled cities on computers, adding people, cars, an eco-system and an internal logic of how the environment would develop over time. The result, in 1989, was SimCity , the first game based around building civilisations rather than napalming them. </p> <p>Legend has it that in 1991 Wright's home was destroyed by fire and, as he and his wife pieced their life back together, he observed patterns in the way they re-acquired items for their new home. This 'dolls-house' concept bore fruit in 2000 with the game in which the player designs characters' houses and nurtures them through life's ups and downs. </p> <p>By then Wright had sold his development company, Maxis - where he rode around the office on a red electric scooter - to Electronic Arts in a $125 million deal, personally banking an estimated $15m in stocks. EA's marketing muscle ensured The Sims would be a global smash hit. Wright once remarked: ' SimCity made me as rich as I need to be and this is definitely a labour of love. If I didn't do this I'd probably be building something - almost certainly it would be something to do with robots. They're cool things to build.' </p> <p>Wright's house, modest by millionaire standards, is full of robots, including one named Misty, rather than rich men's ostentatious playthings. Every year he and his daughter take part in an annual 'Battlebot' competition on US national television. He once joked: 'I don't think I'm a robot. I'm not sure I could tell if I was.' His favourite film is 2001: A Space Odyssey yet he does have a hinterland, devoted to 'reading, skiing, scheming'. </p> <p>His friend Peter Molyneux, one of Britain's leading game designers, said: 'He is eccentric and always thinking of what we'd regard as an outlandish thing. He knows what he wants to do, and he naturally has inspiration rather than having to look for it. He's more comfortable talking about computers and programming than beaches or fast cars, and he'd rather spend all his money on a robot that walks upstairs or a giant ant farm. He's got enough robots around him to be described as a geek.' </p> <p>Molyneux is in no doubt about the scale of Wright's achievements. ' The Sims is a work of true and utter genius, and what Will has done is creatively and culturally very significant. The Sims has taught the games industry not to care only about murder, violence, guns, horror and sci-fi. It talks to us about everyday life and the everyday world. It also paints the American dream: you can start in an apartment somewhere with no friends and by the end you can be super-rich with a beautiful girlfriend living in a palace.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:technology@observer.co.uk\">technology@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Meet the newest conqueror of the Wild East. You wouldn't expect an obscure lawyer from Copenhagen to be perhaps the single most successful investor in Russia since the collapse of the Berlin Wall. But BP, Shell and all those seeking fortunes in Russia's bracing business environment could learn a thing or two, apparently, from Jeffrey Galmond. </p> <p>Galmond, it transpires, is the owner of Ipoc, which hit the headlines 10 days ago after scoring a significant victory in its long-running legal battle with Alfa Group, the oil and banking conglomerate run by controversial Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman. </p> <p>The dispute is over who owns a major stake in one of the country's leading mobile phone companies, and contains enough of those familiar Russian allegations of double-dealing and financial chicanery to make even the most hardened Western investor quail. </p> <p>So it's doubly surprising to survey the charmed life Galmond has enjoyed in 15 years of doing business there. </p> <p>The 54-year-old built a modestly successful legal practice in Denmark before starting to advise numerous European clients on Russian investments in the early Nineties. Details of his subsequent career are not widely known but he seems quickly to have become a serial investor himself, making canny plunges into Russia's property and telecoms markets. </p> <p>Galmond's involvement in TCI, a leading Russian telephony firm, netted him a fortune and was apparently only one of several business coups. </p> <p>So far, he's also proved himself more than capable of holding his own in a knockabout court fight with Fridman, one of Russia's richest men. Galmond's story is all the more remarkable for being so little recognised until now. </p> <p>Ipoc has stakes in numerous telecoms, media and IT firms - enough, it is speculated, to propel Galmond into the billionaire league - yet his status as the company's owner, rather than merely its boss, was only revealed during the court proceedings. Ipoc is based in Bermuda, an offshore haven with minimal disclosure requirements, and had previously described itself as an international investment fund serving a number of (unnamed) Russian and Western investors. </p> <p>Ipoc and Fridman's Alfa are fighting over a 25 per cent shareholding in MegaFon, the third-largest mobile phone company in Russia. The complex case is being fought in half a dozen legal jurisdictions; with so much at stake, that may not be surprising. </p> <p>MegaFon, part-owned by Norwegian telecoms giant TeliaSonera, among others, has long been earmarked for a possible \u00a31 billion flotation in London and could prove a fantastically valuable asset. </p> <p>Ipoc says it agreed to buy the 25 per cent from Russian-based investor LV Finance in 2001, and handed over about $74 million in transfers and loans towards the purchase. But Alfa, it is alleged, bought LV Finance in August 2003 and unlawfully transferred the stake into its own portfolio. </p> <p>Alfa, which is keen to foster closer links with Western businesses, challenges this version of events, insisting the MegaFon shareholding is its property and that this was a 'genuine and proper commercial transaction'. </p> <p>Fridman's company was recently dealt a blow, however, by the International Chamber of Commerce arbitration tribunal in Geneva, which ruled that Ipoc is the rightful owner of the stake. </p> <p>Although Alfa was not directly involved in the Geneva proceedings, which Ipoc had brought instead against LV Finance, the tribunal came to some damaging conclusions about Alfa's role. These included the observation that Fridman's firm tried to take control of the MegaFon stake even though it knew that Ipoc had a prior legal claim to it. </p> <p>Alfa furiously denies this, and the Geneva ruling, though a setback for Fridman, is not the end of the matter. Technically, the ruling governs only a fraction of the 25 per cent MegaFon stake under dispute. To get its hands on the rest, Ipoc will have to secure a similar judgment from an arbitration court in Zurich this autumn. Even then, it would have to go to court in the British Virgin Islands to get the judgment enforced. </p> <p>In the meantime, there has been plenty of mud-slinging. Last year Ipoc was embarrassed by the revelation that Vidya Sharma, its former president, had a conviction for fraud. </p> <p>Ipoc said it had been unaware of the conviction and that Sharma left the firm on the day it emerged. The firm has also been forced to deny that it is a front organisation for Leonid Reiman, Rus sia's communications minister and a former business associate of Galmond's. </p> <p>On the other side, timely reminders have surfaced of an old and embarrassing row between Fridman and BP over the ownership of Russian oil firm Sidanco, although relations were patched up and Fridman is now a major strategic partner of the British oil giant. </p> <p>And in a separate sign of the murkiness threatening to envelop proceedings, Alfa and Ipoc have both denied spying on the chairman of the Geneva panel after it was found that Kroll, the private investigator, had put him under surveil lance. Swiss police are currently investigating the matter. </p> <p>The Kroll issue is typical of the many blind alleys into which this labyrinthine dispute appears to have turned. Delayed hearings, asset freezes and debates over jurisdiction have all held things up. And all the while a cloud of uncertainty hangs over MegaFon itself, with key strategic decisions inevitably delayed until its future ownership is sorted out - hardly an ideal situation in the fast-moving world of mobile telecoms. </p> <p>Galmond is unmistakably the victor in round one of his legal fight with Fridman. But in such a long and bruising bout, can either truly emerge as the winner?</p>",
  "For Borik Rubaiv and hundreds of other pupils at Beslan's Middle School Number One, it was to have been a celebration of the first day of the new school term. Parents carried flowers and teachers wore their best clothes. A Tannoy played music while the children formed lines alphabetically around the swing bars on the playground lawn. <p>It was some of the older children who noticed them first - a masked group quickly crossing the railway tracks that run behind the school. Some, giggling, thought it was a joke at first, until they picked up the anxiety of the adults waving at them to run. </p> <p>'The kids first ran towards them and then they ran back towards us in the school. Within moments, we were surrounded,' said Borik's aunt, Vala Hosanova </p> <p>Some of the children further back were luckier. Diana Kubalova, 14, ran with some of her classmates, a parent and a teacher back into the boiler room, in the bowels of the school. There they hid as Russia's worst-ever hostage crisis unfolded. Back in the playground, the militants quickly got their bearings. 'They asked us where the sports hall was,' said Hosanova. 'They then said that, if we did not go in there immediately, we would all be shot.' </p> <p>According to witnesses, this was not the only group of terrorists. Another band had infiltrated the school in a van. </p> <p>While his friends were lining up, Soslan Bigayev, 13, had been wandering around the school looking at the renovation work that had been done. Thirsty, he headed for a water fountain. </p> <p>'I thank God that I became thirsty. It saved my life.' While he was drinking, the second group drove into the school. 'Men jumped out of the van,' Bigayev said. 'One of them had a long ginger beard, thick bushy eyebrows and a red-and-green skull-cap. He fired an automatic rifle into the air. I knew immediately that they were terrorists because of all the other attacks that I've seen on TV over the past few days.' </p> <p>Bigayev fled. His friends fared worse. Caught between gunmen coming from two sides, an estimated 1,000 children, teachers and parents were herded at gunpoint into the gym, a new building about 10 metres wide and 25 metres long. </p> <p>The first act of their captors was to order adults to hand over their mobile phones and cameras. It was the first sign that the militants had prepared well for their siege. Two years ago, when Chechen terrorists seized 800 theatre-goers in the Dubrovka theatre in Moscow, mobile phone calls had played a seminal role in helping the authorities to map out the layout of the crisis. Here, there would be no such errors and they would not be identified if they escaped. </p> <p>And now it appears the planning had gone far further than learning from past mistakes. According to Russian state security officials, the gunmen and women had pre-planted extra weapons and explosives, smuggled into the school during rebuilding work over the summer holidays, and hidden them beneath floorboards. </p> <p>As the militants filed through the school's corridors, one of Kubalova's friends peered through a crack in the door to see men with impressive beards - and two women wearing face masks and suicide bomber belts - march around the school, talking in Russian to each other, with what sounded like strong Chechen accents. </p> <p>At that moment, Kubalova came across an Ossetian man, to whom she whispered for help. The militants heard, and ran towards the group, grabbing some, but allowing 14 to escape. The news of the seige of School Number One was out. </p> <p>As local police rushed towards the red brick building, grabbing whatever escapees they could, the first exchanges of gunfire began and the first casualties fell dead. </p> <p>Anatoli Sikoyev, a parent in his fifties who was recovering from a stroke, made a desperate dash to save his child that nearly cost him his life. </p> <p>'When I heard the news, I rushed to school to save my family' he said from hospital that evening. 'I approached the schoolyard and came across a man with a huge beard. </p> <p>'He shouted at me: \"Lie down and crawl backwards\". I could not lie down, so I bent over and began to move back. Then another man shot at me from a window, hitting my hand and skimming my head. Now I am helpless and here.' </p> <p>As the gunmen fired out of the windows at fleeing parents and children, inside the school the terrorists were also separating men from women, according to witnesses shooting several male teachers in the process. </p> <p>Inside the gym, the terrorists were also busy rigging up a series of bombs. Two wires were run from the basketball hoops at either side of the hall. On these wires, and on the hoops, mines, each the size of a Mars bar, were intermittently strewn. The walls and entrances were also booby-trapped, and two large plastic containers were put in the middle of the floor. </p> <p>The militants had also set the men to work dragging a cupboard across the gym's main entrance, blocking it off, before they were marched to another room. </p> <p>And as the fighters' leaders introduced themselves to their captives by their noms de guerre, any doubts that they had about the identity of their kidnappers and the peril they were in were quickly dispelled. </p> <p>According to the Kommer sant newspaper, they called themselves Magas, Fantomas and Abdullah, the first two of whom were associates of the notorious Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev. </p> <p>The newspaper identified Magas as Magomed Yevloyev, an Ingush who organised the bloody raid on Ingushetia on 22 June, in which more than 90 people died. Fantomas is a former bodyguard of Basayev, who is alleged to be an ethnic Russian. </p> <p>Other Russian media identified the leader as Doka Umarov, a Chechen separatist leader. </p> <p>Terrified, the thousand hostages inside the gym tried to adjust to the stifling cattle-truck conditions, leading many to strip off their clothes and others to have panic attacks and breathing difficulties. </p> <p>Children and women had to sit shoulder to shoulder. 'There was not enough room to stretch out your legs,' said Hosanova. 'Sweat was trickling down us. We could not breathe. </p> <p>'They had opened a tiny gap in the windows at the top, but that was having no effect. It was like a sauna in there, but they refused to make it any cooler.' </p> <p>The terrorists moved quickly to establish their control over the captives. 'Three women in suicide bomber belts and masks said that, if we cried or shouted, they would take action', said Hosanova. To ensure the hostages that their rules were not for breaking, they killed a man whom they had caught using his phone. 'We will kill 20 to 40 of you if you use these again', they warned. </p> <p>Outside the school, the chaotic scenes that had greeted the first attempt by local police and militia to rush the building was rapidly settling into an armed stand-off. </p> <p>As the gunmen and bombers inside secured the school's buildings, Russian security forces - including officers from the Ministry of the Interior and OMON - had set up their own perimeters, bringing forward armoured cars and snipers. </p> <p>The residents of Beslan, a town of 35,000, also appeared, some armed with weapons and sporting white armbands to distinguish them from the gunmen. There were perhaps as many as 5,000 of them. </p> <p>Specialist rescue teams had been brought in too from Russia's Ministry of Emergencies, to deal with the crisis. But, for all the preparations, one error would be made that would later contribute to the huge death toll - too few ambulances would be brought up outside the school. </p> <p>And it was not only on the ground, outside Beslan's School Number One, that the security authorities had gone quickly into emergency mode. In the Kremlin, too, the phone lines were buzzing as President Vladimir Putin's officials demanded to know what was going on - and precisely what the kidnappers were demanding. </p> <p>For despite the obvious - that the latest terrorist atrocity was somehow linked to Russia's brutal war in Chechnya - how and why was still not clear. </p> <p>The demands were not to become any little clearer until just a few hours before the siege reached its awful and bloody denouement. </p> <p>North Ossetia's leader, Alexander Dzasokhov, briefed journalists on his knowledge of the negotiations that were already in train. </p> <p>'They said Chechnya should be separate from Russia, be an independent state. But they didn't go beyond this assertion. They didn't say who they would like to talk to, or anything. My impression is that they are cut off from the outside world,' he said. </p> <p>The Russian authorities had already made a decision totally out of keeping with their customary violent approach to Chechen hostage-takers. Faced with the risk of another disaster such as the Moscow theatre siege, which ended in scores being asphyxiated when Russian special forces used gas to subdue all within the auditorium, the Russians would talk. More extraordinarily, the Kremlin would ask for help from Chechen separatist leaders whom it had long regarded as beyond the pale. </p> <p>Unusually, Putin himself, who ordinarily wastes no opportunity to expound his beliefs on Russia's fight against terror and who rose to power on the back of the Chechen threat, at first remained silent. </p> <p>When he finally broke his silence, it was only on Thursday, a day into the siege. And then it was to reinforce the growing belief that Russian forces would negotiate, not storm the building. </p> <p>'Our main task is, of course, to save the life and health of those who became hostages. We understand these acts are not only against private citizens of Russia, but against Russia as a whole. What is happening in North Ossetia is horrible,' he said in remarks shown on Russian television. </p> <p>Inside the school, the terrorists were formulating their demands, which were passed in two notes to police outside. They sought the release of 24 militants arrested after a June raid by suspected Chechen separatists on neighbouring Ingushetia, in which Fantomas and Magas were implicated. They wanted to meet the presidents of Ingushetia and of North Ossetia, and other senior officials. And of course, they made the key and unfulfillable demand - the same that the Dubrovka hostage-takers had - of a complete Russian military withdrawal from Chechnya. At 15:38, they said, they would kill 50 hostages for each one of them who died and kill 20 if they were injured. </p> <p>Inside they made a show of the lethal force they were prepared to use on themselves as well as their thousand hostages. About 20 of the men were gathered up and taken to the second floor of the main school building, to the right of the gym. </p> <p>There, they were shot dead. One survivor said that she thought a female suicide bomber may also have been involved in their murder. Their bodies were thrown out of the windows and left to rot in the afternoon sun. </p> <p>After that, the first night of the siege in the school passed quietly. </p> <p>A few hostages had been allowed to drink water from the taps and showers in the changing rooms next to the gym. Only a few exchanges of gunfire and grenade blasts breached the calm of the siege. </p> <p>But by the following morning, the mood worsened. The militants began the day by upping the stakes. </p> <p>'They smashed the handles off the taps in the changing room so we could not use them', said Hosanova. 'Water became a big problem. We had to wring out our clothes to drink our sweat from them. We even drank our own urine, the children were so thirsty.' </p> <p>Sitting in her flat yesterday, wretchedly awaiting news of her missing sister and niece, she shows with her dress how they demanded the children make a filter of four layers of clothes through which they could drink their own urine. </p> <p>'The smell had become unbelievably bad by then', she said. </p> <p>Inside the school, the tension was rising as conditions worsened. Random grenade blasts and gunfire sent ripples of tension through the crowds, tearful women ducking as explosions rocked the courtyard. </p> <p>Tamara Peroyeva, 63, knew that something would have to give soon. She was sandwiched between two complete strangers, all of them in relative states of undress, writhing around in the grime of the gym floor and their own waste. Her grandson and other kids had used her belly as a pillow and for while they had laid on top of each other to try to keep up their strength. </p> <p>Then the children had decided that chanting might change the militants' minds. 'Water, water, water', went the chant, as if they had forgotten this was not a normal gym class. 'We still had not seen any water, and the kids were crying', she said. 'The terrorists tried shooting in the air to silence them - there was nothing else that appeared to work.' </p> <p>But as night drew in, and the authorities promised again there would be no siege, the chaos grew worse. 'The shooting stopped them crying for five minutes, but then they started up again.' </p> <p>As dawn broke on Friday, Hosanova felt that events were about to take a turn for the worse. </p> <p>The militants told them that, 'If they come at us with tanks, we will fight back until we run out of ammunition. But then we will take your lives as well as our own.' She noticed also that the male militants had begun whispering to each other for the first time, clearly not wanting to be overheard by the hostages. 'If they start a storm then only you will be to blame,' one said. </p> <p>It was at 13:05, just a few moments after traditional Muslim prayers, that the day broke apart. </p> <p>The men from the Russian MInistry of Emergencies had been nervous about their mission, but were keen to do it. After negotiations with the gunmen inside the school, they had been told that they could collect some of the bodies lying both inside and outside the buildings, because dogs had begun to worry some of the corpses. </p> <p>Entering the school in two ambulances, they carefully left their vehicles and crossed to where they could see the first of the bodies, one of them propped up against a car. As the paramedics picked up the first two corpses, the air was rent by two powerful blasts, followed by the sound of small arms fire. </p> <p>As the emergency workers took cover, they saw a middle-aged man emerge from the smoke, wearing only a pair of trousers, covered in dirt. </p> <p>Startled into action by the two explosions, Russian troops staggered forward and began firing at the windows of the school, in an attempt to cover the escape of the bloodied survivors who were beginning to emerge from the building. At the same time, two Russian tanks moved in. </p> <p>Inside the school, Hosanova recalls that she was sitting calmly when the first explosion sounded. She believes that one of the mines strung up between the basketball hoops in the gym had gone off. </p> <p>'We all fell down and held our heads in our hands. We tried to cover the children with our bodies. What else could we do? I was totally disorientated. Those closer to the wall were luckier and did not get injured. Bits of roof and glass were falling everywhere. I looked up and saw that the woman next to me was dead. Children were running everywhere, panicking. A masked militant came near me and took some hostages away with him.' Soon she saw soldier with Spetznaz - Russian special forces - insignia, and was led to safety. </p> <p>Ilfa Gagiyeva ran instinctively for the window when she heard the first blast. Yet before she jumped, she turned back, shocked that she had forgotten her daughter, Diana, seven. She said a second, 'strange-sounding' blast rang out. </p> <p>'I grabbed her and then moved to the changing room. Hassan, one of the militants, was in the toilet during the first explosion and, when he came out, he tried to help people to the window to get fresh air. We stayed in the small hall near the gym for 20 minutes until the Spetznaz reached us.' </p> <p>Outside the school, a scene of utter carnage was unfolding. </p> <p>At the local administration, the doors of the nearby cafe burst open and dozens of children, grimy, bloodied and some limp, were hurriedly carried out into the street by police and bystanders. Helicopters swarmed overhead and automatic gunfire and explosions answered each other. </p> <p>A group of militants appeared to head back over the railway, towards the direction from which they had come. A group of helicopters buzzed after them. Panicked, Spetznaz tried to block the railway, their efforts part-hampered, part-helped by groups of sweaty local men in tracksuits, bearing hunting rifles and eager to get involved in the fight. </p> <p>Nearer the local Palace of Culture, the dead were beginning to be brought out. A seemingly endless stream of stretchers was half-dragged, half-carried toward the school, returning laden with another limp form. A young girl, her sooty form covered in bits of roof insulation. A woman, nearly naked. </p> <p>The closer to the school, the thicker the blood - the Spetznaz troops had been exchanging fire with the gunmen from nearby apartment blocks. The terrorists' grenades had blown them out of the windows. </p> <p>Below, local men were determined to reach their children and wives in the school. They broke through a garage wall that connected with the school's playground. </p> <p>And then came the bodies. Children, alive, blackened, blinking with shock. Dazed mothers. </p> <p>On the other side of the school, events had taken on an Inferno-esque turn. </p> <p>On one side, local men and police gathered, eager to bear stretchers, to end their helpless, hopeless inertia, yet not involved in the military operation. One Alfa special forces soldier involved in the siege angrily told the Gazeta newspaper: 'There would have been a lot fewer victims if the local civilians had not got involved.' </p> <p>An armoured personnel carrier was rammed against the school wall, and a fire truck sat in the centre of the playground where a single red rose lay, its petals mangled, mottled by soot. </p> <p>But the worst was to come - what lay inside the still burning gym. It was revealed as the Russian troops continued to fight the last of the gunmen who had taken the school. At one stage, a tank was called up to clear a basement room. </p> <p>They are scenes that will never be forgotten by those who fought there that day, some of whom are still struggling to understand what happened and whether they contributed to the high death toll. </p> <p>Among them is a Spetznaz soldier called Vitali, who told the Kommersant newspaper: 'There was no command to storm and we did not return fire until we knew it was the end. The Vitez Spetznaz unit went in first. We saw a terrible fire in the gym.' Another Spetznaz trooper said: 'There were a lot of children on the floor; it was full of them'. </p> <p>Even the most battle-hardened struggled to cope with what greeted their eyes. Lt Col Andrei Galageyev told Gazeta : 'When we entered the gym, I saw a 2 litre plastic bottle filled with plastic explosive and metals balls. I have been at war since 1994, but I have never seen anything like that. There were dozens of mangled bodies, some of them still burning.' </p> <p>Hosanova, whose sister and niece have yet to come home, put it differently: 'We cannot say what it is. There are no words for this.' </p> <p><b>Timeline of conflict</b></p> <p><b>1830</b></p> <p> Russian forces move into Chechnya to secure borders with Ottoman Turkey, sparking Chechen resistance. </p> <p><b>1859</b></p> <p>Chechnya fully incorporated into Russian Empire. </p> <p><b>1917-1925 </b></p> <p>Revolution and civil war lead to an attempt at creating an autonomous theocratic state.

  "<p>It's nearly midnight. I'm sitting with my laptop, writing. One of the programs running on it is iChat, Apple's instant messaging (IM) program. On the right-hand side of the screen is a window showing a list of people with whom I work. (It's called a buddy list - a nauseating term, but one that I cannot find a way of changing.) Some of the names are 'greyed out', which indicates that they are not logged on to the net. But a few people are online, including a colleague who is based in Seattle (where it is 4pm). </p> <p>Suddenly, my computer beeps and a window pops up. It's a message from Seattle. 'Hi!', it says, 'I see you're still up. Would it be OK to phone?' I say yes. A minute later the phone beeps and we have a long and productive conversation about a project on which we are both working. </p> <p>At one level, this is just a simple tale of everyday life online. But it bears thinking about. For one thing, my colleague and I are separated by several time zones, but IM gives each of us a sense of the other's 'presence'. We have several other co-workers on this project scattered throughout the world, yet we can all tell instantly who's 'there' and who's not. </p> <p>This is a really important benefit of IM. It enables members of far-flung families, for example, to have a sense of one another's virtual presence. I have a friend whose daughter went off on her own to a university in Korea for four months. Her mother was understandably anxious about how she would fare in such an environment, but IM bridged the gap for both of them and made the separation bearable. Researchers at the Open University have taken this a stage further and developed an application called Buddyspace. It is built on IM and enables students studying the same course to see a map showing the location of fellow students at any given moment. </p> <p>Because IM involves sending messages, people sometimes regard it as just a different kind of email. It isn't. Go back to my first example: my Seattle colleague could have used email in advance to schedule a phone call. But in fact he didn't realise he needed to talk until he noticed I was online. He didn't have to risk the intrusiveness of an unexpected late-night phone call. But IM enabled him to phone, secure in the knowledge that the timing would be OK for me (and that it would not wake the children). </p> <p>Email is great for some things. It's good for exchanging views and holding group discussions, for example. But it's hopeless if a group of dispersed colleagues needs to make a decision in real time because they get locked into an endless loop of out-of-synch messages. I've worked on the design of websites, for example, where the final decisions have been made via IM exchanges between colleagues, each of whom is watching the site as it evolves and providing instant feedback to the designers. This facility for interacting in real time is one of the reasons IM is spreading like wildfire in large organisations. </p> <p>Outside the workplace, IM use is highly age-dependent. Most people over 40 haven't used it. (Until recently, many of them didn't even know what it was.) At the other end of the scale, I have yet to meet anybody aged 16 or younger who hasn't used it. Indeed, because it's a real-time communication medium, it's probably the reason why so many kids are now competent and fast typists - if you want to have street cred in IM, your fingers have to move quickly. If you doubt that, watch a teenager who is keeping several IM conversations going at the same time. </p> <p>Where teenagers go today, adults eventually follow. (Remember what happened with SMS on mobile phones?) A survey released last week by the Pew Internet and American Life Project provides the first reliable statistical evidence for this. The survey reveals that 42 per cent of US internet users now use IM - and a quarter of those use IM more frequently than email. This translates to more than 12 million adults who use IM more than email. </p> <p>Technology watchers are always looking for the Next Big Thing. IM isn't new, but it's already very big, and getting bigger all the time. If you're over 40, maybe you should look into it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a>. <a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/\">www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/</a></p>",
  "<p>Selling in May, as the old stock market adage instructs us to do, would have been a sensible idea this year. Since the start of that month, the FTSE 100 has continued the pattern which has characterised 2004, creeping upwards then drifting downwards, to lie around 50 points below its spring level. </p> <p>But should we also pay attention to the second part of the adage and come back again on St Leger's Day which, this year, falls next Saturday, coincidentally the third anniversary of the 11 September attacks? </p> <p>The professional fund managers are certainly hoping that the end of the summer holidays will get the market moving again. Trading has been very quiet and, while there have been some pockets of excitement, such as the Spanish bid for Abbey or last week's asset sales and cash back from National Grid it has been hard to drum up buying interest. </p> <p>'The worry is that what we have seen over the last few months is normal,' said Jeremy Tigue, who manages the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. 'The stock market has been treading water and it is hard to think of a catalyst for change.' </p> <p>On the plus side, it does look as if the period of rising interest rates here may be close to the end. Last week's house price and mortgage lending data both suggest that the housing market is cooling while the CBI's retail sales survey was the worst for more than a year. </p> <p>The Monetary Policy Committee may decide another quarter point is needed - although no move is likely after this week's meeting - but there is a growing consensus that rises are coming to an end. That may not be as positive as it seems. If retail sales and housing are both slowing, where will the economic growth come from? China is running out of steam, Japan is slowing and the US recovery, which encouraged the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates last month, now looks a bit of a chimera. </p> <p>Fed chairman Alan Greenspan may insist that the US is merely in a 'soft' patch but, as John Hatherly, head of global analysis at M&amp;G says, 'he is beginning to look like a professional cheerleader'. Corporate profits have been improving: the half-yearly results season was good, at least as far as historic performance is concerned, and the early signs are that the third quarter's will have continued that trend. But most chief executives remain subdued about prospects and some, such as Cisco, warn customers are becoming more cautious. </p> <p>Hatherly points out that the combination of higher profits and a static stock market has made shares look better value than for some time. Here in the UK, the price-earnings ratio - a key measure of valuation - stands at around 13 times analysts' forecasts of 2005 profits, half what it was at the peak, and even the US market looks less extravagantly valued on around 18 times 2005 estimates. </p> <p>But, just as high valuations endured during the bubble years, so shares can remain cheap for long periods. Justin Urquhart Stewart, of Seven Investment Management, thinks the stock market could remain subdued at least until the end of 2005 and he emphasises the importance of considering all types of assets to invest in. He recommends avoiding property, both retail and commercial, which have become over-popular, but says bonds could become more attractive as interest rates peak. In the short term, however, he thinks cash is attractive with some building societies such as the Skipton, paying 5.75 per cent on a three-year bond offering better rates than 10-year gilts.</p> <p>Edward Bonham-Carter, joint chief executive of Jupiter Asset Management, predicted a 'hippo' market last year and thinks it could continue to wallow for some time, although there may be a short-term bounce in the autumn. He steers investors towards income funds, which should continue to benefit from companies handing cash back to shareholders, as Centrica and National Grid have done. Those investing for children or grandchildren - and with some appetite for risk - should go for the better growth prospects of emerging markets. </p> <p>In the short-term, however, you should not expect much from the stock market. 'Put \u00a310 on a horse in the St Leger,' said Urquhart Stewart. 'It will be more fun.'</p>",
  "<p>Sir Clive Woodward would love to win another World Cup - the one staged in South Africa in 2010 when Wayne Rooney will be in his pomp. </p> <p> Observer Sport has spoken to a number of sources close to the man who masterminded England's 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph. They have no doubt that once Woodward has fulfilled his obligation as head coach to the Lions on their tour of New Zealand next year he will settle for nothing less than trying to win the biggest prize in sport. 'There is no question that Clive's dream is taking England to the World Cup in both rugby and football,' says one. </p> <p>It is a measure of the man's confidence that he genuinely believes that he could pull off what would be a remarkable double. Whatever was said last week when he resigned as head coach of the England rugby union team - and it was quite a lot, at times threatening to boil over into open acrimony with Woodward blasting away merrily at the Rugby Football Union's incompetence while sitting bang next to their chief executive, Francis Baron - what is really driving Woodward is the conviction that the game does not have the scope to accommodate his ambition. Only football - his first love as a child, and the one truly universal sport - has that. </p> <p>Top-table dress code was instructive at last Friday's bristling press conference, held in the sublimely named Spirit of Rugby suite at Twickenham. (By the end that spirit was smeared on the walls, more red stuff than at an abattoir on market day.) Woodward looked presidential in a neatly tailored suit, while Baron and Graeme Cattermole, chairman of the RFU management board, sported England cufflinks, club ties and looked like workaday businessmen. </p> <p>Of all the many words spoken, none captured the essence of Woodward better than when he said: 'For all I know I'm in a minority of one, which doesn't mean I'm wrong.' He will take that brand of burning self-belief with him into football, whose door has already been held open by another singular man, Rupert Lowe, the forthright businessman who is chairman of Southampton. </p> <p>There was some surprise among those closest to the 48-year-old Woodward that he did not commit himself to football with immediate effect, so determined is he to establish a presence in the game. A change of heart seems to have overtaken him after his two-hour lunch with Baron in west London on 12 August, when he gave his employers the first indication that he intended to quit. </p> <p>This meeting clearly concentrated Woodward's mind on whether he could straightaway take his first steps in football, which will involve his attempting to gain a grade-two coaching award, and at the same time fulfil his ambition of being in charge of the Lions on their 10-match tour of New Zealand in summer 2005. He decided this would not be possible and committed unconditionally to the Lions. This would appear to contradict those who accuse Woodward of wanting to get out of rugby before his reputation suffers any more blemishes such as those when England were comprehensively beaten in Test matches in New Zealand and Australia in June. He knows only too well that defeat for the Lions next July will lower his stock, but he is bold enough to take that risk. </p> <p>He will then make football his unwavering priority, almost certainly with the help of his good friend Lowe, assuming the man who runs the Saints with a teak-hard benevolence - ask the club's just-departed, questionably unsuccessful manager Paul Sturrock about that - is able to convince his board of the benefits of taking on someone whose only record of sporting success is in rugby union, which much of football, contrary to the evidence, still regards as an unreconstructed toffs' recreation. </p> <p>Thereafter, if Woodward were to achieve his ambition of becom ing involved with the England football team and, ultimately, take them to a World Cup, he would have to prove himself at club level, not as a hands-on coach but as the sort of driven overseer who served the rugby union team so well. He would then need England's footballers to fall short at the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany, at which point there could conceivably be a clamour for the man who has won one global event to be given a go at winning another. </p> <p>One man who knows Woodward better than most is Humphrey Walters, a management adviser who deserves a fair share of the credit for England's victory in the Rugby World Cup, having been called in to give assistance in 1997. Between them, Woodward and Walters set about applying the principles used successfully in business to running the national rugby union team. 'Clive and I were the first people to do this,' says Walters. 'Previously, sporting people had been telling us in business how to run ourselves. Clive was adamant he wanted to adopt business principles. He said, \"Look, this is a business, the business of winning.\" It happened to be rugby, it could have been computers, it could have been anything. I agreed with him.' </p> <p>Interestingly, Walters himself has taken the same path that Woodward now intends to follow, having started to work in football by assisting the Bolton manager, Sam Allardyce. Walters says that now he has observed at first-hand how football is run he thinks there is no doubt that Woodward could bring a massive amount to the game. </p> <p>It is wrong, says Walters, to regard business principles as working only at a dry, technical level; what is more important is that they are used to develop the emotional side of players. 'Remember that in team sports most of the time is spent off the field and the whole rationale of what Clive will bring to football is making these players feel aspirational off the field so that their on-the-field performance is better. </p> <p>'The problem with the England football team is that they're a temporary workforce who are thrown together. There's no emotional side to the whole thing. You've got a most unemotional bloke in charge. There is nothing on the passion side, which you get with the successful rugby union teams such as the All Blacks and Australia.' </p> <p>Benchmarking is something Walters and Woodward borrowed from business to improve the England rugby team's performance. 'It's a matter of saying what are the critical areas of the game and how do we compare with world class. This is what a supermarket would do; they look at a whole series of things and compare themselves with others. The good ones go way outside their sector, which is what Clive's very good at. </p> <p>'He didn't just restrict himself to rugby because everyone in the game had that information. He said that if England were going to be different competitively they had to look outside rugby and get ideas from sources where perhaps other people wouldn't look. Look at Australian Rules to see how they catch the ball; at rugby league where they tackle more.' </p> <p>As Jonny Wilkinson said yesterday: 'His hallmark was his inexhaustible search for that step ahead. His was a constant quest to get ahead and stay there.' </p> <p>As for the switch to football, Wilkinson thinks it will work. 'Clive's ability as a manager makes what he wants to do very realistic. No one knows what Clive is capable of more than himself.' </p> <p>Walters believes there are many ways in which the rigorous and detailed approach Woodward will bring to football will achieve an improvement, each by small amounts that, taken together, will represent something substantial and worthwhile. He cites two examples: 'When a team score a goal, instead of getting back to the centre circle before the opposition, who are crestfallen, they run around the pitch, lifting their shirts up and celebrating and by the time they regroup for the kick-off they've completely lost the momentum of what they've achieved by scoring. </p> <p>'Then at throw-ins, which should be a competitive advantage, what happens is that someone grabs the ball and then his mate comes up and says, \"Oh no, it's my throw-in.\" By the time it's taken everyone is marked and the advantage is lost.' </p> <p>Walters says he knows football people will be sceptical, but he points out they were when Woodward promised to transform the way England played rugby union and in the end 'they played a game people never thought England were capable of'. </p> <p>One Premiership manager who is not sceptical is Harry Redknapp, of Portsmouth. 'Anyone who thinks he couldn't do well in football is foolish,' said Redknapp, who expects Woodward to be successful at Southampton. 'He won't coach and with the way clubs are run these days he would be unlikely to get involved in transfers. </p> <p>'But Woodward would be great as a motivator and an overseer, helping out a young coach and employing the nous that turned England into rugby world champions.' </p> <p>If there is to be a second instalment of Woodward in charge of a national team, it could be even more enthralling than the first.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "By the time the old Thamesmead school was closed in 2002, just six per cent of students were getting A to C grades in their GCSEs. There was serious violence among the students, teachers had been attacked and we were the last-choice school in the borough. <p>More than 50 per cent of the students at Thamesmead have special needs and more than one-third are on free school meals. When these students leave school at the end of each day, they walk into an area with the highest unemployment in Bexley, where gangs roam with knives, and where young lives are routinely wasted through drugs and violence. </p> <p>Despite those serious problems, our pass rate last year was 35 per cent, with 95 per cent of our students getting five grades at A to G. That puts us in the top 25 per cent of schools. But the biggest praise I can give my teachers is that this now seems a completely normal school: that is a phenomenal achievement. I don't agree with permanent exclusion, so we are working with almost exactly the same students as before. </p> <p>We are trying to do things very differently, although some people agree with us and some don't. The most controversial thing I have done is not to have heads of departments or years. Those jobs are shared between the teachers, who phone the parents directly with updates of their children, good and bad. </p> <p>On Fridays, we have a business day where children set up their own companies. One of the most successful businesses makes new computers out of separate parts they buy in. Their computers have been bought by everyone from Greenwich University to local families. I have one at home: it runs perfectly. </p> <p>I am determined that my school is going to teach its students that they are successes. We have a compulsory uniform and it has done wonders in increasing students' respect for themselves. </p> <p>This is a chance for us to really make a difference in people's lives. When I see the progress these children have made, it reconnects me with why I came into education in the first place.</p> <p><b>Hopes</b></p> <p>To see staff settled into our ethos; to push innovative teaching; no exclusions; every student to embody our three rules - respect themselves, each other, and the environment.</p>",
  "<p>You can tell a lot about a man and his work from his office desk. Take a look at Patrick Grayson's minimalist set-up at his new firm, GPW, and, apart from the usual phone and pen-holder, your eyes will fall on the following: a pair of powerful-looking brass binoculars; a letter opener in the form of a lethally pointed hunting knife; and a hand grenade. </p> <p>'If this had gone off when it was supposed to, we wouldn't be talking today,' says Grayson, and passes over the heavy and brutal-looking (but now harmless) weapon. He explains how, while he was an Irish Guards officer in Aden in the early Sixties, the grenade was thrown at his jeep, landed by his feet - and failed to explode. 'I was lucky. Others weren't so lucky in Aden.' </p> <p>At 60, Grayson does not look or sound like his CV suggests: Sandhurst, Guards, tobacco executive, arms salesman, 'private military services' provider, corporate investigator. His manner reminds me, at least, more of his Catholic education - he would suit a soutane and biretta - with a large strain of City gent. </p> <p>It is a package that must impress potential clients - the big investment banks, corporations and law firms that he hopes will provide his bread and butter at GPW. The company was launched last week with a flurry of publicity about Grayson, its chairman, and his two partners, Andrew Wordsworth and Peter Pender-Cudlip. </p> <p>The aim is to fill a niche in the corporate investigations market, below the big global firms like Kroll Associates (more of whom later), Control Risks and Risk Advisory group, but focusing on the 'pure' investigative business rather than getting diverted into security and private military services. </p> <p>'There are people out there making squillions of dollars out of Iraq, but we don't want to do that kind of thing. We want to get back to basics. I suppose if we had a corporate motto it would be \"pure intelligence\". I rather like that,' says Grayson. Grayson learnt his 'pure intelligence' from the master of the art, Jules Kroll, the legendary founder of the eponymous firm that made the corporate investigations business respectable. 'I owe everything to Jules,' says Grayson. 'In fact, the whole industry owes everything to him.' </p> <p>His modesty does him credit, but when the two men met in 1986, Kroll must have known he was getting a seasoned professional who had already succeeded in four careers, and who was looking for his next challenge. Grayson had just finished some work on behalf of the families of Kuwaiti hijack victims who felt the airlines had failed in their duty to protect passengers, and Kroll was impressed by his work. 'I think he was quite taken with this Englishman who seemed to know his way round the world,' says Grayson. </p> <p>That is where the CV comes in, and it is no surprise that Kroll was impressed by a track record that wouldn't look out of place in an Ian Fleming novel. </p> <p>The son of a ship owner turned Army officer, the young Grayson travelled a lot as a child, and after boarding at Downside he went straight into Sandhurst, and from there to the Irish Guards. </p> <p>He caught the tail end of the British empire in Kenya ('I helped to haul the flag down in 1963') and then to Aden, where the British were fighting against Yemeni tribesman as well as urban insurgents. After his close call with the grenade, he learnt fluent Arabic, which was put to good use later. </p> <p>From the Middle East, he was posted to Hong Kong, where the British were eyeball to eyeball with the People's Army at the height of the Chinese cultural revolution. 'It was really tense. We thought the Chinese would invade any day, and dead bodies would come floating down the rivers on the border at night time,' he recalls. </p> <p>Then he was sent back to the UK for general training, but realised, in his mid-thirties, with a wife and three children, and 14 years in the army behind him, that it was 'commit or quit'. He decided on the latter, and doesn't seem to regret passing over a senior military career with 'all those boring generals'. </p> <p>He found a job via a personal contact as a marketing executive with Imperial Tobacco, which in those days was branching out overseas. 'I was a smoker, but knew little else about it. I learnt all about branding on the job, and enjoyed it, but in the end I got a moral issue about marketing the stuff to young people all over the world, so I quit and joined Heckler &amp; Koch.' </p> <p>As he relates this, Grayson stops for a second to see if I've spotted the gaping irony involved in having moral qualms about selling cigarettes, but none at all about selling H&amp;K's deadly weapons. </p> <p>'Well, I suppose I stopped being a hypocrite, at least,' he says. 'Soldiers have guns, and somebody has to manufacture them.' The job with the German company came his way 'via an old friend in the SAS' as he was strolling around London the day of the Iranian embassy siege in 1980. 'I had military experience and marketing skills, so it seemed quite natural to sell equipment to people like the Bahraini anti-terrorist units.' The Arabic must have been a job-clincher. </p> <p>The next scene sounds like a Fleming plotline. 'I was at home one Sunday when there was knock on the door and there were these three Kleinwort Benson bankers who I knew - they had military backgrounds. They wanted to invest in the private military sector, and thought I could start something up for them.' The result was Defence Systems Limited, which specialised in providing security guards for foreign, especially American, embassies in the Middle East and later became DSL. </p> <p>Even then, in the mid-Eighties, diplomats in the region were feeling increasingly vulnerable, but could not use their own troops outside the embassy com pounds. 'We hit on the perfect solution - we used former Gurkhas as security guards, unarmed, outside the grounds, and they had such a fearsome reputation that it worked,' says Grayson. It was the success of DSL that brought him to the attention of Kroll. </p> <p>'Jules called me and asked me to New York, all paid, to meet him, so I said why not? We met in his office on Third Avenue, and he offered me a job. When I told him I already had one, he said: \"I'll fix that\".' From the prepossessing Kroll, who had just been headlined 'Wall Street's private eye' by the New York Times , this amounted to an offer Grayson couldn't refuse, and was the beginning of his eight-year role as head of Kroll in Europe. </p> <p>This was the City after Big Bang, the revolution that changed the face of the Square Mile. 'It was exhilarating stuff. The old-boy network was weakening because of all the foreign banks coming in, but we still met some resistance. Some of the old school would tell us they got all the intelligence they needed in Whites club, but we got over that.' </p> <p>Kroll, and Grayson, played a major part in some of the epic corporate confrontations of the era, and had some of the biggest business names as clients or opponents - Goldsmith, Hanson, ICI, BTR, Minorco. Perhaps his biggest career achievement as an investigator came when he led the Kroll team that tracked down the foreign assets of Saddam Hussein after the Gulf war in 1991. </p> <p>The fees rolled in, and Grayson left 'on good terms' in 1994 to set up on his own as an adviser to the investigations business. 'I've been the \"honest broker\" in the sector,' he says. </p> <p>He accepts, though, that honesty has not always been traditionally associated with the investigations business. Dirty tricks, phone-tapping, even searching through rubbish bins, have sometimes been the modus operandi for the corporate gumshoes. 'I spend as much time telling people what I don't and won't do as much as what I will, and we try to err on the side of caution,' he says. </p> <p>'But there is some information that falls within the realm of legitimate investigation. If the chief executive is drinking a bottle of scotch a day, it affects the business. If he's having an affair outside of work, it probably won't, but if he's having an affair with his secretary, it might. And surveillance, though risky, is sometimes legitimate. The morality is genuinely vague,' he explains. </p> <p>Some modern investigators believe, in this information-rich world, that the best sources are the publicly available ones, and Grayson agrees there is much to be gained from the internet and other hi-tech sources. 'But in the end you've also got to use up the shoe leather and accumulate knowledge. All the surveillance in the world will not replace knowledge and experience.' </p> <p>With his partners in GPW, Grayson is back on the beat in the Square Mile.</p>",
  "<p>There are stories that are so bonkers they are best told straight. Lidl, the German discount retailer with UK stores, ordered its Czech female workers to wear arm bands during menstruation (there's no nice way of putting that). According to an August edition of German trade retail magazine Lebensmittelzeitung, local managers decided it was the only way to be sure that women were not taking unnecessary loo breaks. Women with an arm band could go as often as they liked, instead of waiting for the official breaks. Lidl declined to comment on reports that the policy had been piloted in Poland, or indeed to comment at all when Lebensmittelzeitung asked for a response. Calls to the UK HQ in Livingstone, Scotland, met with an interminable recorded message which explains that it is impossible to talk to a human being. The German magazine said the policy has been quietly axed, noting the uproar in the Czech press and bemoaning the effect on Czech-German relations. Was it an example of the famous German Gr\u00fcndlichkeit (thoroughness), it asked. No one on Cheapside is qualified to answer. </p> <p><strong>Suits you, sir</strong></p> <p> Those no-nonsense northern folk at Matalan celebrating improving sales are keeping their feet on the ground.

'If I don't wear it, how can I expect the customers to?' Quite. There's more, though. 'It's made in an Armani factory and has it more wool in it than the one M&amp;S sells for \u00a3135.' Can it be so? Well, not quite. 'We don't sell a suit for \u00a3135,' says a spokeswoman. 'Perhaps he means the \u00a3129 suit? We won a Queen's Award for that one for technical innovation.'

  "<p><strong> Checkpoint</strong><br> <strong> by Nicholson Baker </strong> <br>Chatto \u00a36.99, pp115 </p> <p>Nicholson Baker, who began his literary career as the inspired miniaturist of The Mezzanine and Room Temperature, was pitched into the political arena when it emerged during Monicagate that his phone-sex novel, Vox, was Clinton and Lewinsky's favourite reading. Now, it seems, he has acquired a taste for politics. </p> <p>Little more than a novella, or a one-act play, Checkpoint is the transcript of a rambling, Mamet-like conversation between two Americans, Ben and Jay, in a Washington hotel room. Their subject? Jay's plan to assassinate 'this unelected fucking drunken OILMAN... squatting in the White House', i.e.George Bush. </p> <p>On the face of it, Checkpoint looks like a book to be read during the interval of David Hare's Stuff Happens. Much of the book is relentlessly polemical and was obviously written in a white heat in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib torture revelations. </p> <p>Jay's denunciation of Cheney and Rumsfeld is just the kind of thing Amercan Democrats say to each other over the Sunday morning waffles and maple syrup: 'These rusted hulks, these zombies, have fought their way back out of the peat bogs where they've been lying, and they're stumbling around with grubs scurrying in and out of their noses and they're going, \"We-are-your-advisers.\"' </p> <p>Angry the book certainly is, but it is also entertaining and some of Ben and Jay's exchanges are as funny as anything Baker has ever written. Checkpoint is also, in part, a meditation on the past 50 years of the American presidency and on the progressive failure of America's political class to define America's global role in the world properly. </p> <p>Checkpoint is certainly an oddity among the fiction which has been published during this election year, but it also demonstrates Nicholson Baker's command of dialogue, his sure way with American vernacular and his instinctive gift for attracting attention.</p>",
  "<p>I have never been completely clear in my mind on the subject of my sexuality. Often labelled a 'closet queen' by gay and straight alike, usually in jest, I submit to this false image for the sake of peace and quiet. These jibes come from two quarters - homophobes who have no clue about the gay psyche, and then, rather surprisingly but equally irritating, militant gay men who are deluded in their notion that the world is in a high state of homosexual denial. All such contradictions and conflicts came home to me last year when I was in Palm Springs, staying in Liberace's mother's house during Pride Weekend in November. </p> <p>My daughter Kate and I - she, like me, is a filmmaker - were making a documentary commissioned by the BBC: an intimate account of a year in the life of two Englishmen called Andrew and Jeremy Get Married . During that year I converted to the view that to deny two men or two women the same legal rights afforded a heterosexual married or co-habiting couple is to deny homosexuals a social privilege as crucial as any of their other fundamental human rights. </p> <p>Palm Springs is the sprawling desert community made famous by the Hollywood Rat Pack of the 1950s. Its population is now almost 50 per cent homosexual, and the area almost rivals San Francisco in its status as the gay capital of Bush's homophobic America. </p> <p>I'd made a deliberate decision to have a woman working with me. Kate, 26, provided balance in what at times could be an uncomfortably male dominated environment. During the Pride Weekend she was the only woman in a house of 14 gay men - and me. One night, after Kate had gone to bed, I found myself being schmoozed by a drunken and proudly gay Texan. Only yards away, my daughter was being kept awake by his persistent seduction attempts. Only when I proclaimed emphatically that I didn't like sex with men did he accept defeat. He gripped my face, kissed me symbolically on the lips and flounced off to his lover's bed. I collapsed in laughter, as did Kate who had been suppressing her mirth throughout the whole embarrassing interlude. She then explained, to my astonished protestations, that over the months of filming many gay men had said they found me sexually attractive. Did I mind that I had been sexual prey for this or any other man? Not one jot. I was flattered. </p> <p>I had met Andrew and Jeremy at a summer dinner party thrown by the novelist and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi. They were sitting silently and apart in Hanif's garden. Andy, who is tall, bronzed and well proportioned, was nervous and awkward - it turned out that this evening had been in the diary for months but he had been reluctant to be exposed to what he thought was an elite group of London's literati. Jeremy - small, professorial, with a greying beard - was much more relaxed. There was no indication at first that these two wildly different men even knew each other. Andy told me he had met Jeremy in an Earl's Court gay bar and that they had been lovers for five years. My level of curiosity increased: not because they were gay but because they seemed such an unlikely, albeit engaging, combination. What I learnt that evening was enough to persuade me to spend a year following their stories. Why? </p> <p>Apart from having a perfect opportunity to show two homosexual lovers living their lives outside any of the camp stereotypes which abound in the media, there were other tempting reasons. Jeremy provided me with an opportunity to lay a personal ghost. I was raped and abused by my French master when I was 12. When I wrote about this in The Observer, I nursed a fear that I had been too harsh on my predator. Jeremy told me he had been a schoolmaster in a private boys' school and had lived through the same era of sexual repression that was typical for homosexuals in the 1950s, when I was at boarding school. He explained that he, like 99.9 percent of gay men, would never have dreamt of abusing his professional position. </p> <p>Andrew also presented me with another strong issue to grapple with which had personal resonance. Both his parents died without knowing their son was gay. I too had hidden my boyhood homosexual experiences from my family and parents for 35 years. Why were we both so unnecessarily secretive? </p> <p>Andrew was born on a council estate in Lee, south London - a fiercely homophobic environment. The youngest of three, he was brought up believing that one day he would 'meet a girl, court, then get married and have 2.4 children'. Meanwhile he took part in queer-bashing sessions with local thugs. 'I realised that if they had known, it would have been me getting that kicking.' For years he tried to make relationships work with women but found himself constantly eyeing up men. Sex with women was always disappointing. On leaving school Andrew drove buses for London Transport for nine years. Meanwhile he discovered the cruising scene, which led to dozens of unsatisfactory, emotionally frustrating one-night stands. He quit his job - he now had an alcohol problem which made it dangerous to drive, and was experimenting with heroin. Unemployed and living on benefits, he financed his habit by stealing from his mother. Finally he was jailed for dealing. </p> <p>He joined a rehabilitation programme in jail and managed to curb his addiction enough to survive a serious attack of hepatitis. Somehow, too, he managed to stay clear of HIV. </p> <p>Jeremy came from a very different world - a privileged colonial background similar to my own. His father was a major in the Indian Army and Jeremy was sent away to a boarding school in Sussex. His first full sexual encounter came when he was at Cambridge in the Fifties. During that era homosexuality was a criminal offence and Jeremy risked jail. Disturbed psychologically by his sexual predilections, he secretly sought out psychiatric help. He was advised to 'take a cold shower' and 'just get married and it will go away'. One shrink recommended electric shock treatment. In desperation Jeremy married the beautiful sister of the man he had most desired at Cambridge. Their marriage, consummated in Afghanistan where he had a job working as Shell's only representative on the northwest frontier, was a disaster. Predictably they divorced. When he finally returned to England to a teaching career, he resorted to placing adverts in magazines seeking sexual partners. </p> <p>It was the Sixties now, and men such as Tom Driberg, Ronnie Kray, Lord Boothby and Quentin Crisp were the celebrities of the gay world. Although it was still illegal, homosexuality was beginning to become acceptable. Finally the Wolfenden report paved the way towards a momentous change in the law. Jeremy was free to have as many lovers as he wanted. </p> <p>On 1 May this year, in Norman Foster's magnificent City Hall which overlooks the river and Tower Bridge, Andrew Thomas, 48, a retired bus driver 'married' Jeremy Trafford, 68, a retired teacher. Andrew's two sisters pitched up with their families, including Andrew's nephew, who is gay. A group of Jeremy's bohemian friends came. The chairman of London Gay Writers read from the Old Testament; an opera singer friend sang 'Can't Help Loving That Man of Mine'. Andy insisted on his favourite love song: 'When I Closed My Eyes'. And they exchanged vows and rings. </p> <p>For Kate and I, these powerful, moving public gestures were the crowning moments in our year of filming them. It was also a fitting layman's challenge to the Church of England's inexplicable reluctance to accommodate homosexual marriages. I had been as moved by Andrew and Jeremy's non-religious vows as I had been at a friend's grand Church of England wedding in a Chelsea church the previous Saturday. Ironically, from a statistical standpoint, the heterosexual marriage had less chance of a happy ending. </p> <p>Every week on the top floor of City Hall, the Mayor of London has been sanctioning Britain's most public official platform for men to marry men and women to marry women. These commitment ceremonies, as they are called, are almost a celebration of marriage. A registrar attends, and every couple's public commitment is entered in the London Partnership Registry. There are many other venues for ceremonies like these but only Mayor Ken Livingstone has had the courage to make available - for a small fee - his administrative headquarters to these moving rituals which challenge and defy those who believe that marriage can only exist between a man and a woman. </p> <p>In San Francisco the mayor took his powers a step further and gave the same status as conventional heterosexual marriage to same-sex weddings in his City Hall. But the Californian legislature has now overturned his decision, and 'gay marriages' have lost their legal legitimacy in the one state most likely to accommodate them. </p> <p>In the last few months several states have passed laws making the very concept of same-sex marriage illegal. Among westernised Christian societies, the United States is not the only reactionary country. Last month in B\u00e8gles, south-west France, the mayor was accused of breaking the law when he sanctioned the first gay wedding in France. The marriage has since been declared 'null and void' by Dominique Perben, France's Justice Minister. </p> <p>Here in London, ceremonies like the one Andrew and Jeremy went through can be recorded in the London Partnership Registry. This quasi-formal union has no formal legal status but is a halfway house until the bill going through Parliament later this year hopefully gives homosexual couples similar legal rights to those enjoyed by all co-habiting heterosexual couples within or outside marriage. That would end the situation whereby the bereaved partner of a gay relationship is denied unchallengeable claim to their lover's pension rights. Nor would the state be able to refuse a man his right to live in Britain with his male partner free from the fear of deportation - just because he cannot exercise the same rights to become a citizen which a foreign woman can exercise if she legitimately marries a British man. Who knows, we might even see a gay royal wedding, one day. Perhaps Andrew and Jeremy will be invited. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> Andrew and Jeremy Get Married debuts at the Toronto Film Festival on 10 and 12 September.</p>",
  "<p>There is a protocol to interviews like this one. The rule is that the subject must always confide that they were the odd one out at school, the local geek, the misfit. Keira Knightley was teased for being a late reader; people ran away from Erin O'Connor screaming in fright; and when Jamie Oliver walked into class, everyone chanted, 'Special needs!' Apparently. But when TV's property Miss Moneypenny Kirstie Allsopp says, 'I was the weird one at school,' I know she was right; I was there.</p> <p>Kirstie wore velvet hairbands and kilts and Puffa bodywarmers, when everyone else wore ripped jeans and DMs and grandad overcoats. She had framed pictures of domestic pets on her bedside locker, liked mum music (Elkie Brookes, Neil Diamond), dropped nobby names with abandon, and possessed the sort of ringing RP that meant Pony Club and Sloane Square and shooting in Scotland. She was pure rah, an entirely different sort of posh from the craven, glottal-stopping norm, with our Smiths tapes and Indian throws and patchouli joss sticks from Camden Market. The thing was, Kirstie simply couldn't morph. In a sea of fakers and canny survivalists, she was unable to dissemble. She was who she was (just as, on telly today, co-presenting a rather authoritative property show, she is entirely herself: a slightly revved-up, camper version for sure, but still authentically Kirstie). It's obvious in retrospect how splendid an achievement that was. It demonstrates a confidence of identity that few 15-year-olds possess. But at the time, a group of us danced around her in the dormitory, singing Hall and Oates' 'Rich Girl', while Kirstie went red with fury and indignation and, oh Lord, a sort of agonised pleasure, because she was always, always hungry for attention.</p> <p>It's not usual to begin an interview with an apology, but this one has to. Kirstie, 31, dismisses it with a cheerful snort. She has long since made her peace with a fairly miserable adolescence. 'It just happened that I wasn't good at schools. That's why I went to so many. I just struggled. Mum said she saw it when I was little, she says I had little stunted social antennae from birth. Out of some children's heads spring these social antennae, with state-of-the-art bells and whistles. Well, one of my social antennae was deformed, and the other was stunted. I grew them. But it was a struggle.'</p> <p>There's another pin-sharp impression I have of teenage Kirstie, and that's of her gallumphing attempts to get on socially. She was always a trier - the nicest maths report she ever got said, 'It's such a pity Kirstie won't pass her GCSE because she really has worked hard,' - and when it came to making friends, she was precision-guided. This transparent ambition enraged people more than anything else, but you sensed she didn't even know she was doing it. She liked pretty things; she wanted to be friends with the pretty girls. 'Mum said it was agonising: at every new school, she'd see me make a beeline for the coolest kid in the class, absolutely determined to be that person's best friend, come hell or high water.'</p> <p>She has always been a dog-type person, full-throttle, heart-on-sleeve: apparently unembarrassable. So she crashed that precocious clique with all the subtlety of a wrecking ball. There was some resistance, and I was forever coming across Kirstie in corridors and on stairwells, in noisy torrents of tears because she'd been cut out of a breakfast date (any normal mortal would have lain low, hoping such a slight wouldn't become public knowledge). But Kirstie's best friends are still those girls: framed photographs of them are scattered throughout her flat. Only the other day, one of them told her the only reason they're all still in touch is because Kirstie is so good at organising get-togethers, and 'I nearly cried. I felt that was such a cool thing. That means I've grown my antennae.'</p> <p>Her flat is in a quiet street in North Kensington - just the sort of street she'd pick out for a punter on her house-hunting show Location, Location, Location, since it is equidistant to both chichi and scuzzy neighbourhoods - is also decorated exactly as you would expect. It's a million miles from minimalism, packed with chintz, stripes, good oils, bead-and-butt woodwork in pearly blues and creams, corduroy sofas, snapshots of people in evening dress and cushions so excessively plumped, in that rah tradition, that they are practically spherical. A one-bed country pile in west London, it is rather definitely not groovy. 'Ladylike' is the word that springs to mind, though its owner, who had friends over last night and so is repeatedly hijacked by a succession of yawns and burps, does her best to undermine that impression.</p> <p>Kirstie's dad is Lord Hindlip, the former chairman of Christie's, a dashing auctioneer who roared with laughter when Ali G asked him why Van Gogh cut off his penis, and shouted, 'Sock it to 'em!' when a black velvet Catherine Walker dress raced past its $50,000 estimate during the 1994 sale of Diana's wardrobe. Her mother, Fiona, is an interior designer, a cat type who believed 'rather sweetly, that it was the other kids who were out of step, and if she found the right school, there'd be other kids who would be, like me - special. It's a thing all parents feel, you expect your child to be recognised as, basically, dazzling. So she waited for that to happen to me, and it didn't.'</p> <p>Kirstie left Bedales, where I knew her, after GCSEs. She studied for A levels in a desultory fashion, while working part time answering the phones in an estate agency. That was when she started to feel happy about herself. 'As soon as I was in a working environment, with grown-ups, I was being judged by how hard I worked, and how well I did. The practical was suddenly a good thing, and I have semi-domestic talents, I suppose.'</p> <p>A variety of the usual premarital Sloaney pasttimes kept her busy for the next few years. When she was 19, she got a job with the flamboyant interior designer Nicky Haslam, which paid 50 quid a week. 'Complete baptism of fire. He'd lost his licence, so I was driving him all over the place, getting involved in one decorating disaster after another.' On one occasion, the lilac silk tenting they had prepared for the VIP dining room at London Fashion Week was condemned by the fire officer an hour before the lunch was due to start.</p> <p>Then she went to work at Country Living magazine. She was an editorial junior on nine-and-a-half grand, and in many respects it was like a sort of finishing school with lunch money. Not only did her dyslexia put a damper on any advancement up the masthead, but, worse, much worse, there were no men. Everyone menstruated in synch. She didn't have a boyfriend the entire time she was there. The statistic that 40 per cent of people meet their partner through work haunted her throughout her time at the magazine. At school, she had never turned up for any of her careers advice sessions. What was the point? She was going to leave school at 16 and get married, and 'everyone knew that. I really didn't need a career. So at Country Living I was just biding my time, waiting for him to turn up. And he didn't.'</p> <p>It was around this time that I last bumped into her. It was late autumn and Kirstie was planning, with one of her girlfriends, to launch a service buying Christmas presents on behalf of cash-rich, time-poor execs: a sort of proto-concierge company. When I mention this, she shrieks with pleasure. 'Oh yes! I'd forgotten! That's so cool! I always credit myself as not having any ambition, but I did, I did, I was really mad keen on that idea. I always used to think that I'd be good at being a highpowered PA. It's that thing of making people's lives easier, seeing a need and sorting it for them. I never minded the thought of being a dogsbody.' In the end, though, she chickened out and - having bought a flat with parental assistance - joined a history of art course at Christie's, mainly in the hope of finally collaring the future father of her four children. (Her dad was still running the auction house at the time: did she get funny looks from the staff? 'No, because my mother and my brother had both done the course,' she says, innocently.) Christie's turned out to be good for her confidence. At 21, she realised that she wasn't quite as idiotic as everyone had thought: by osmosis, she had picked up a grounding in art and architecture.</p> <p>The next box to be ticked on her Sloaney checklist was supposed to be an interior design business but then fate - or former New Labour spin doctor Derek Draper - intervened. A friend of a friend, he asked her to find him a flat, and soon loads of Westminster and media types were ringing up, asking for help in tracking down the right property. There was a namecheck in the Guardian, in the Telegraph, then Channel 4 asked her to do a screen test with an ex-marine called Phil Spencer. Kirstie always had a certain charisma, but now she had something to add to that: competence.</p> <p>She says the screen Kirstie - who is now something of a dykon thanks to her bossiness, her spike heels, her 'luscious dark hair' - is pretty close to the real thing, 'just more domineering. I don't fake it, I don't think it's a different me, it's just a bigger me.' The show is now in its eighth series, and its presenters are in professional partnership offscreen as well as on, charging clients of Garrington Home Finders a minimum fee of six grand.</p> <p>The temptation to make life a bit simpler by just concentrating on the telly work is not an option. 'I am neurotic about the fact that telly is transient and borderline demented,' she says. 'Property is my security blanket. If you don't have a day job, or at the very least a job you can go back to, you are setting yourself up for a terrible fall.' And in any case, though her assurance in front of the camera has now grown to the point where she's experiencing 'a bit of a transition ... I could probably do anything, as long as it wasn't stupid,' the last few weeks have shown her the risks involved in heightening her profile, after several tabloids suggested that she had been involved in breaking up the marriage of a schoolfriend.</p> <p>Though reluctant to talk about it, she's seething about the way the press twisted the story of her relationship with Ben Andersen, a property developer. Before all this blew up, she had a rather sunny view of her position in the entertainment firmament, believing that because she and Phil were property finders rather than TV stars - because they never went to film premieres or to parties given by people who were not friends of theirs - the tabloids wouldn't bother with them. 'It turns out I was completely wrong about that. There is no difference, no deal. You are fair game. I feel so stupid. I've been so naive. And to be honest, if I had any ambition to further my career in telly, it might have been knocked on the head by that. It has brought me up sharp.'</p> <p>She has been thinking about something I said earlier on. 'You know you said that at school I probably wanted attention?' she asks. She admits there's an element of truth to that. She has always been gregarious, noisy, in need of reassurance. But just recently she has realised that some sorts of attention she can do without.</p> <p>It's not true that she and Ben were seeing each other before he and his wife Theresa, another Bedalian, separated in January. 'I'm incapable of having an affair with someone else's husband. I'm sure I'd stab my own grandmother to get certain things, but that's not one of them.' In fact, it was Theresa who introduced them for the first time, at an April fundraiser for Orlando Fraser, the Tory prospective parliamentary candidate for North Devon. Kirstie had gone along to the event at London's Bush Bar and Grill with an ex, half-hoping they might get back together, and was talking to Theresa when Ben turned up. They danced and he rang her later with an invitation to dinner, and she said yes. It wasn't a big deal to Theresa: in fact, when she next saw Kirstie, she said, 'By the way, I think Ben quite fancies you.'</p> <p>Uncharacteristically cautious when the topic is raised, Kirstie will say 'Theresa's totally OK with it. But she's furious about the story. For Tree [Theresa] to be painted as the victim is ridiculous. It's completely scummy.'</p> <p>A few weeks ago, she'd have jumped at a recent overture from Simply Come Dancing, because she likes the idea of competition, and glittery frocks and learning something new. Now, if the production team turns out to be serious, she's pretty sure she won't do it. But before you well up in sympathy, it's worth bearing in mind that she has let me in; a photographer from the Mirror is piling up his equipment in the hall and there's a long list of promotional obligations attached to the publication of How To Buy A House, a guide she has co-written with Phil. In truth, though it's packed with snaps of Kirstie and Phil having a coffee at a pavement cafe, and Phil and Kirstie peering in estate agents' windows, and Kirstie and Phil looking serious in the snow, it also has some useful tips in there that might just make the whole business a little less painful (though, personally, I have a bit of a problem with the idea of buying an ingratiating cappuccino for the agent before a morning viewing).</p> <p>Kirstie takes the hobby that turned into her calling card very seriously indeed: she has fervent opinions on stamp duty, the extension to the congestion charge, property tax inconsistencies, asbestos-removal legislation and the new housing bill (which she pronounces as useless as a chocolate teapot). And if she brandishes these opinions a bit, banging on crossly until, sinking deeper into her cord sofa, I find myself mentally checking out and inspecting the books on her shelves (lots of Dominick Dunne, Kitty Kelley and, of course, Jilly Cooper), who can really blame her? These opinions demonstrate that she is more than a telly personality in heels and a wasp-waisted red coat; they also - as she points out herself - make her feel better about the fact that she never took her A levels that seriously. It's one of her big regrets. The other? 'I wish,' says Kirstie, 'I wish I'd realised years ago that everyone feels the same way. Everyone feels left out, insecure, scared. There are a few people who are more resilient, but they are the weird, strange, left-out ones: the ones who are so tough that they never worry what anyone thinks.' It's the sort of thing that people do tend to say in interviews, but coming from Kirstie, it has the ring of absolute truth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How To Buy A House is published on 9 September by Michael Joseph, priced \u00a312.99</p>",
  "<p>Goodness me, is that the time already? It is the 10th anniversary of the internet cafe. Ten years have passed since Eva Pascoe, an enterprising young Polish woman, capitalised on a popular new hobby by opening Cyberia, the world's first computer-and-coffee shop, in Whitfield Street, central London.

  "<p>Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has referred to it as the 'nice' decade - 10 years of non-inflationary, consistent expansion. Americans speak of the 'Great Moderation'. But whatever the designation, the phenomenon is much the same. Over the last decade, economic activity in Britain and America has continued to fluctuate, but less violently, severe recessions have been avoided and inflation has stayed low and stable. The same is true of other major economies, although Germany and Japan have performed relatively badly. </p> <p>Gordon Brown has not been slow to point out the striking improvement in Britain's economic performance. The average scale of the ups and downs in Britain's annual rate of growth over the last 10 years is less than half that seen in the 1950s and 1960s, a period historians regard as a Golden Age. And, unlike Germany and Japan, lower volatility has not been accompanied by an overall decline in the average rate of growth, leading to a remarkably long period of expansion. </p> <p>Undoubtedly the greatest triumph has been the avoidance of severe recessions - depressed periods when growth turns negative and unemployment soars. According to Professor Jordi Gali at the CREI Institute, who has developed with others a novel way of estimating some of the consequences, the severe early-1980s recession may have cost America between 3 and 12 per cent of annual household spending. In Britain, the toll was probably higher. As Gali rightly argues, limiting the depth and persistence of recessions is 'highly valuable from a social viewpoint'. </p> <p>The key question is whether stability will last. Many think not. Recent headlines predict that terrorism, high oil prices, market bubbles and natural disasters will bring greater turbulence. </p> <p>Since Britain's degree of economic tranquillity has been so exceptional and probably partly the result of luck, it would not be surprising if the next decade proved more unsettled. But there is a world of difference between a little more volatility and a return to the turbulence of the 1970s and 1980s. </p> <p>To gauge orders of magnitude, Professor Robert Rowthorn of Cambridge University and I have analysed how Britain, America, the eurozone and Japan would fare if their economies were subjected to the shocks to output, inflation, interest rates and budgets seen over the last 20 years. We chose this period because it covers a wide range of unsettling events, including, in Britain, the mid-1980s miners' strike, Chancellor Lawson's late-1980s boom and the unhappy, thankfully fleeting, membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Worldwide, there were booms and busts, currency disruptions, oil price shocks, gigantic stock market bubbles and several wars. </p> <p>Despite the scale of shocks, our calculations paint a fairly benign picture. Although projected volatility of growth and inflation rise a little in the UK over the next decade, both remain at levels below even those seen in the 1950s and 1960s. </p> <p>The chance of experiencing a severe recession also rises a little - to about 4 per cent, assuming Britain's average rate of growth is 2.5 per cent a year. But this is a huge improvement compared with the 1970s and 1980s. Elsewhere, we find only Japan remains particularly vulnerable to severe recession. </p> <p>The main cause of this enduring stability is better monetary policy and the defeat of inflation. People cease to worry about inflation when it is low and when they can rely on institutional arrangements to keep it that way. As a result, inflation is less likely to feed on itself or to be affected by changes in the pressure of demand. High inflation, by contrast, tends to self-generate and is often subject to sharp changes of gear, causing real disruption. Our analysis shows the shift from monetary neglect in the 1970s to monetary order in the 1990s to be the main force behind the global outbreak of economic stability. </p> <p>So, if stability is to last, the first condition is that the new monetary standard must survive. </p> <p>The second proviso is that the scale of the shocks and surprises that buffet economies should be no more extreme than those of the last two decades. Were there to be a major calamity of the kind mentioned in the general exclusion clauses of insurance policies, all bets would be off. But most of the identifiable dangers that fuel today's gloomy headlines do not fall into that category. </p> <p>Consider the problem of the world's undue reliance on American expansion and the associated untoward US trade deficit. The latest strategic assessment by Professor Wynne Godley and his colleagues at Cambridge shows in compelling detail how unsustainable this process is, with rising US current account and budget deficits as far as the eye can see if growth is to be maintained. </p> <p>Evidently, the pattern of US growth must eventually change to rely more on an expansion of exports relative to imports. Godley suggests a further 25 per cent dollar devaluation, combined with a significant budgetary tightening - adjustments that are unlikely to be achieved easily. </p> <p>Some form of growth disruption seems probable, but not on a scale greater than seen in the last two decades. After all, the dollar fell precipitously after 1985 and America managed to solve its then-daunting twin deficit problem while enjoying the first fruits of greater economic stability. </p> <p>Or consider the threat of high oil prices, which recently peaked at more than $45 a barrel. Even if Brent crude were to reach $50 a barrel this winter, the rise in Britain's oil import bill over the year would amount to only 0.5 per cent of national income. Taking into account the effect on Britain's oil exports, the shock would be equivalent to only 0.25 per cent of national income, a figure that pales in comparison to the 3 per cent hit the UK suffered in 1974. </p> <p>Admittedly other economies are more vulnerable but it would take a much more significant increase in oil prices to trigger a severe global recession. </p> <p>And, finally, consider the little local difficulty of Britain's over-priced housing and the sharp rise in household borrowing. Some calculations put house prices at 30 per cent or more above normal while the increase in household debt in relation to incomes has exceeded that seen at the top of the Lawson boom. As debtors are more vulnerable than savers to unpleasant shocks, this has adverse implications for stability. </p> <p>But compared with the late-1980s, today's economy is far better-placed to weather a housing market reversal. Policy is now competent and focused on domestic needs rather than on a misplaced exchange-rate target. Moreover, there is no evidence of irrational exuberance outside the housing market itself. </p> <p>At the height of the Lawson boom, inflationary pressures were rising sharply and businesses and households were collectively spending massively in excess of their disposable income. Today, inflation is under control, the stock market is drifting and private incomes exceed spending by a comfortable safety margin, thanks to companies' cash surpluses and the savings of older households. </p> <p>Will stability last? Granted average luck and our current institutions, I would be optimistic. The next decade may not prove to be as 'nice' as the last one but a 'not bad' outcome is within the bounds of probability. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bill Martin is an economic consultant</p>",
  "<p>'Enough is enough' - that's the verdict of Britain's retailers on the Bank of England's slow, steady tightening of interest rates.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium will announce tomorrow that sales growth in August was significantly slower than July's 1.8 per cent, offering fresh evidence that higher borrowing costs are starting to bite. </p> <p>'Retailers want to see some sense of stability,' says David Southwell, spokesman for the BRC. 'We would like them to say to the consumer: \"We now feel we have done the job; we don't foresee future movements\".' </p> <p>High streets were largely insulated from the post-dotcom downturn as the Bank of England cut interest rates to pump up consumer demand and keep the economy on track. But now it's payback time: borrowing costs are heading back to more normal levels, and retailers are worried that shoppers will start to tighten their belts. The long consumer boom could be finally coming to an end. </p> <p>Retailers have already noticed shoppers skimping by buying budget models instead of top-of-the-range products and stocking up on one or two items of clothing instead of an armful. They were forced to offer deep discounts in this year's sales to shift summer stock - though that could partly be blamed on the dreary weather. </p> <p>The BRC is worried that the Bank has gone too far. The consumer boom has already lost some of its oomph since the dizzy days of 2001 and 2002, when sales growth topped 6 per cent a year on the official scale. Last year that declined to a more measured 3.3 per cent. There was a renewed upturn earlier in the year, but on the government's measure, retail sales fell in July for the first time in 14 months. </p> <p>'We feel that this is not about consumer demand any more - it's about controlling the housing market,' Southwell complains. 'The rises we've had so far have already spooked the horses.' </p> <p>Retailers that have enjoyed boom years while consumers flashed their credit cards will inevitably feel cheated as the Bank seeks to rebalance the economy. But shops are not the only places where rising interest rates are causing frayed nerves. Hard-pressed manufacturers are also demanding a moratorium on rises to help offset higher fuel bills, which are squeezing margins. </p> <p>While the housing market captures most attention, the industrial sector is struggling to build on a recovery that has quietly been under way since last year. </p> <p>In the second quarter of 2004 manufacturing output rose by a healthy 0.9 per cent; but fears are mounting that the recent surge in oil prices could dampen demand in the global economy, hurting Britain's exporters. 'The prospects for the global economy aren't as good as they were three months ago,' says Doug Godden, head of economic analysis at the Confederation of British Industry. </p> <p>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, suggested earlier in the year that the world's biggest economy was going through a 'soft spot', and economists are busy downgrading their forecasts for how fast the US can grow for the rest of the year. </p> <p>In the UK, forward-looking business surveys have given mixed signals about confidence. But oil prices are still well above last year's levels, electricity bills are also heading upwards, and firms feel another rise in rates is the last thing they need. Godden believes it's time for a pause: 'We are seeing clear evidence of a moderation in consumer spending. For the time being, we think interest rates should be put on hold.' </p> <p>Rate increases are hard to swallow when they come at the same time as other rises in costs. As firms negotiate their annual electricity contracts, David Porter, chief executive of the Association of Electricity Producers, says it's almost inevitable that bills will rise. There is upward pressure on natural gas prices, and generators face the costs of fulfilling new environmental regulations. </p> <p>'We are going to have to get used to energy being more expensive - and it's going to show up more because we have gone through about 10 years of very competitive energy prices,' he warns.</p> <p>In the short term, energy price rises tend to be inflationary but in the longer term their effect tends to depress industrial activity and consumer spending. In fact, if the oil price rise is sustained, it may do some of the Bank's work for it. Nationwide said last week that higher energy bills would take as much out of household coffers as a quarter-point rate rise - so one way or another, a period of belt-tightening looks inevitable.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Author, Author</strong><br>by David Lodge<br>390pp, Secker and Warburg, \u00a316.99</p> <p> David Lodge's new novel is about the perils and compulsions of authorship, and the ironies of popular and critical success. One peril it doesn't address until its endnote is the one that has befallen it: that someone else should have written a novel at the same time on exactly the same very specialised subject, in this case the middle years of Henry James. Lodge's Author, Author shares a number of scenes with Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's The Master, published six months ago; in fact one particular scene is shared with a third novel, Emma Tennant's wider-ranging Felony (2002), which investigated James's Aspern Papers and its sources. It is the scene in which James is rowed out to a remote place in the Venetian lagoon to dispose of the clothes of his friend, the writer Constance Fenimore Woolson, the dresses rising again to the surface like black balloons. As a symbol of bad conscience, the undead dresses are something any novelist might be pleased to have invented; but in fact all three took the episode from Lyndall Gordon's A Private Life of Henry James (1998) - one of a number of books in the past decade which have sought to probe the complex relations, in James's life, between friendship, sexuality and the demands of his art. Gordon's own source for this otherwise unattested event is not above suspicion; but the image is understandably irresistible to writers who want to catch James at an awkward moment. </p> <p>The idea of \"the middle years\" was a resonant one for James. It was the title of a story he wrote when he was 50, about an author who dies in middle age without ever attaining to the splendid \"last manner\" he believes himself capable of. That James himself did achieve and sustain such a manner through the first decade of the 20th century is one of the great facts of modern literature. But in the early 1890s his career as a writer was in crisis. His sales and advances, never high, had dwindled alarmingly - in 1889 he was offered \u00a370 for his novel The Tragic Muse, which as his friend George Du Maurier points out in Author, Author, was what Punch paid him for a single draw ing. (The novel would sell only 3,500 copies in James's lifetime.) James's optimistic solution to this crisis was to start writing plays, a medium for which he had no real aptitude. A dramatisation of his early novel The American had only a modest success in 1891, and Guy Domville, on which he'd pinned his highest hopes, had a disastrous first night on January 5 1895, when James took a curtain call to a barrage of boos and whistles. It was a decisive humiliation, and the turning-point of his career. T\u00f3ib\u00edn opens his novel with it, but Lodge makes it the climax of his, leading up to it with much informative narrative. </p> <p>James himself disparaged the historical novel, which he felt was bound to be either implausible or inartistic, but Lodge and T\u00f3ib\u00edn feel sensibly uninhibited by such strictures, or by the later James's demanding precepts of the novel as a unified dramatic \"action\". Of the two books, T\u00f3ib\u00edn's has the more Jamesian purity of point of view: he stays strictly in James's consciousness - in fact in an inner chamber of it, home to those primitive doubts, fears and yearnings which gave his work much of its underlying power. Covering the years 1895-99, he travels much further through narrative flashbacks, but his is a purposely muted and unsocialised James, often paralysed in conversation, unable to fulfil his own desires or to respond to those of others. T\u00f3ib\u00edn's interest is in James's failed or merely latent relations, and their bearing on his art. The book succeeds in the way that it should, by being so thoroughly T\u00f3ib\u00ednian - dark, oblique, and tense with repressed sexuality; but it is not in the least \"dramatic\". </p> <p>Lodge sustains the Jamesian point of view for most of Author, Author, framing it with two deathbed chapters in which consciousness is dispersed between different attendant figures. His preoccupations are not so inward as T\u00f3ib\u00edn's, and the James he presents is at times barely recognisable as the same \"character\". Lodge's James is naturally loquacious and social, and his book, reaching from the early 1880s up to 1899, has at its heart the long and happy friendship with Du Maurier. He gets very touchingly James's simplicity of affection combined with subtlety of mind; and explores in detail the ironies of the two friends' contrasting careers through the mid-90s, when James's failure in the marketplace as both novelist and dramatist coincided with Du Maurier's global success with Trilby, not only as a novel, but also as a play and as a very modern kind of mania, trilby shoes and hats being as it were the merchandising. It is a further twist that Du Maurier had offered the Trilby idea to James, who made a note of it, but decided that his lack of feeling for music made a novel about a singer impossible for him. </p> <p>In his portrait of the writer's private life Lodge touches, less interestingly than T\u00f3ib\u00edn, on James's guarded fascination with the Wilde trials, and his prudish attitudes to nudity and the sexual mores of his more bohemian friends. Both dwell on his instinct for bachelorly self-preservation, his cautious relations with Woolson, and his guilt after her suicide in Venice. Both recount, to rather different purpose, the scene when James first saw a naked man, his cousin Gus Barker, being drawn by William James; though oddly neither of them notes James's admission in his memoirs that he \"secured and preserved for long William's finished rendering of the happy figure\", who was to be killed in the civil war. </p> <p>Part of James's richness as a subject is that his life touched on so many others, and Lodge has fun trailing past us in infant form such figures as Compton Mackenzie (son of the actor- manager Edward Compton), Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie (bumped into on a cycle-ride from Torquay). All this is interesting and enjoyable, but one comes to feel more and more that Author, Author is limited, as a novel, by its artless closeness to biography. In his acknowledgements Lodge owns up eagerly to the few small details he has invented, and longish stretches of the book, with its conventional scene-setting and tidy summaries, might well have come straight from a Life of James. The conversations are of course made up, but are often heavy with back-story and explanations to James of things he would already have known. James himself is made to speak courteously and quick-wittedly, but he is not realised with the vividness of numerous real-life anecdotes, which reveal him as one of the most prodigious and idiosyncratic talkers of the age. </p> <p>Stylistically, Lodge, the sharp comic novelist, has put on the slippers of a comfortable semi-historical manner, neither James's nor his own: James's avoidance of the commonplace could be comically fastidious, but it is odd that Lodge himself should be happy with so many fine views, elegant fa\u00e7ades, and cheerfully glowing fires. There are some jarring notes - Edith Wharton would not have been described by the 1930s term \"socialite\" in 1915; \"master bedroom\", on which Lodge makes an awful joke in his first paragraph, is a usage from the later 1920s. But there are good jokes too; James's flattered conversation, on the day of the Domville premiere, with a man in the Reform Club lavatory about what a great day and exciting prospect it is, the stranger in fact referring to an imminent rugby match in Swansea, is part of the deft depiction of the self-delusions of authorship. The recurrent lavatorial note (the Master farting, belching and urinating) is, I suppose, a playful infringement of Jamesian propriety.</p> <p>That there might be a larger impropriety, or at least rashness, in writing a novel about a great novelist and attempting to describe the inner life of a supreme analyst of consciousness, is something of which Lodge, in his closing salutation to James, seems modestly aware. From time to time he riskily quotes bits of actual James, and in each of them - not only the surreally magniloquent deathbed dictations, in which he thought himself to be Napoleon, but the notebook entries, the letters, even the telegrams - James's brilliance and singularity are humblingly evident.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Henry James's unfinished novel The Ivory Tower, with an introduction by Alan Hollinghurst, has just been published by New York Review of Books.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Heresies: Against Progress and Other Illusions</strong> <br>by John Gray <br>200pp, Granta, \u00a38.99 </p> <p> Gary Larson, one of the geniuses of our time, has a cartoon of a field of sheep all grazing peacefully, all, that is, save one wise ovine, who has lifted its head in appalled astonishment to cry out: \"Wait! This is grass - this is grass we're eating!\" John Gray has always been the odd-sheep-out. He is probably best-known for his book Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals, the title of which is taken from a saying by Lao Tzu: \"Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs.\" False Dawn, a debunking of the theory of globalisation, was a global success, having first been dismissed as mere pessimism and later accepted as a soberly realistic assessment of the state of international economics. When the bubble of the 1990s burst with the turn of the millennium, the herd had to admit that yes, it really is grass. </p> <p>Gray has written a fine study of his friend, the late Isaiah Berlin, whose pluralist philosophy he may be said to develop and refine in his own writing, and, one presumes, in his seminars at the LSE, where he is professor of European thought. He makes large claims for Berlin's work, animated as it is, he writes, \"by a single idea of enormous subversive force\". This is the idea, which I call value-pluralism, that ultimate human values are objective but irreducibly diverse, that they are conflicting and often uncombinable, and that sometimes when they come into conflict with one another they are incommensurable; that is, they are not comparable by any rational measure. </p> <p>Certainly this is Gray's own attitude to the warring ideologies of our time. He is richly dismissive, for instance, of the Bush administration's neo-conservatives - \"Washington's new Jacobins\", he calls them - who believe that it is possible to eradicate evil from the world. \"The danger of American foreign policy,\" he writes, \"is not that it is obsessed with evil but that it is based on the belief that evil can be abolished.\" Such foolishness, he points out, is far removed from the wisdom of America's founding fathers, for whom \"the purpose of government was not to conduct us to the Promised Land but to stave off the recurrent evils to which human life is naturally prone\". </p> <p>Gray is an unwavering post-humanist. When we were little, the Catholic catechism used to assure us that God made the world for man's use and benefit, and that therefore we are the lords of creation, with all nature, its flora and fauna, entirely at our command. For liberal humanists, this good news is still good news, but comes in a different bulletin. According to Gray, the so-called secular systems by which we in the west are ruled are in fact the products of spilt religion, as was the Enlightenment faith in the possibility of progress, \"the belief that human life becomes better with the growth of knowledge\". </p> <p>Gray evinces a Swiftian contempt for our latter-day lay priestlings, direct heirs of the 18th-century philosophes who proclaimed a new paganism but were in fact neo-Christians, \"missionaries of a new gospel more fantastical than anything in the creed they imagined they had abandoned\". All the Enlightenment did was to promote religion by other means, and its belief in progress was only the Christian message \"emptied of transcendence and mystery\". One of the heresies promulgated by Gray is that many of those who today continue to hold to religious faith are far more profound in their thinking, and certainly better educated, than most of their liberal-humanist opponents. </p> <p>Gray sees our faith in progress - \"the Prozac of the thinking classes\" - as the illusion that underlies the most egregiously mistaken political and social policies of the present day. Certainly there is such a thing as progress, but it is a fact only in the realm of science, while \"in ethics and politics it is a superstition\". Throughout his work Gray hammers relentlessly against the notion, first advanced in the Renaissance and reified in the Enlightenment, that history moves inexorably in a straight line, and that human nature will necessarily improve as our knowledge accumulates. He grants that in some areas things do get better: we have abolished judicial torture, for example, and modern dentistry is a great boon. The mistake, he contends, the wilful, foolish and tragic mistake, is to imagine that more dental implants and fewer thumbscrews will make us into better beings. \"Human knowledge grows, but the human animal stays much the same.\" </p> <p>Clear thinking is always a bracer, but does Gray as Cassandra have anything to offer other than an injunction to look all gift horses in the mouth? He is a stoic and, on occasion, even a meliorist, though a highly cautious one. All we can do, he declares, is to try to curb the wilder hungers of Homo rapiens and work away piecemeal at containing the forces that seek to destroy us. The so-called war on terror, in which \"Dr Strangelove has joined forces with Dr Billy Graham\", he takes as one of our more dangerously deluded enterprises. Granted, al-Qaida is a threat to the very continuance of our liberal values in the west, but it is the height of foolishness to pretend that we can defeat it by force of arms. Instead of invading Iraq and making threatening noises against Syria and Iran, the sensible policy would be to address regional conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian blood feud, and separate them from the activities of al-Qaida with the aim of returning terrorism to \"more historically normal levels\". The new crusaders in the White House and the Pentagon, of course, would be contemptuous of such a gradualist approach. </p> <p> Heresies collects essays that Gray wrote for the New Statesman from the late 1990s through November of last year. The pieces have been lightly edited, he tells us, and no substantial changes have been made. The prescience of his views on such topics as Iraq and Tony Blair's political career is remarkable. One does wonder what the magazine's readers made of the contention that Donald Rumsfeld's Hobbesian pragmatism is to be preferred to Bill Clinton's impulsiveness, that \"in intellectual terms atheism is a Victorian fossil\", or the baleful but gracefully expressed reminder that \"the human animal is itself only a passing tremor in the life of the planet\". All flesh is as grass, indeed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Banville's Prague Pictures: Portrait of a City is published by Bloomsbury.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tyddyn Llan</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 01490 440264<br><strong>Address:</strong> Llandrillo, near Corwen, Denbighshire<br><strong>Rating: </strong>17/20</p> <p>'Perhaps you can now lose some weight,\" was my mother's characteristic comment when I told her I was giving up reviewing restaurants and moving on to writing the cookery side of things. I stared down at my tummy. It wasn't that bad. I could see my feet. I could even see my knees, if I bent over. Anyway, there's bound to be some collateral if you've troughed in the finest eateries for 15 years. </p> <p>Almost from birth I have loved restaurants, their theatre, their civility, their rhythm, their food. Of course, I have suffered my fair share of bum places, but even the most disgusting experiences have provided food for thought, if not food I wanted to eat. And I was only too happy to put the boot in to places I felt were overhyped, a con or that offended me in some way. </p> <p>But, on the whole, I tried to avoid such places. I have always thought that people want to know where to go to have a good time, not the reverse: if you're going to part with a good deal of money, you may wish to know you have a fair chance of not regretting it. As a critic, you welcome the rotten restaurant because bad reviews are far easier to write. The accepted vocabulary for accurately describing good food, taste, texture and flavour is pathetically poverty-stricken. When it comes to indicting bad food, however, suddenly the full panoply of language and literature is at your command. No comparison is too far-fetched, no metaphor too odious, no comic turn too outrageous. </p> <p>I still had one tour of inspection to carry out, and decided to go to Tyddyn Llan, a restaurant with rooms near Corwen, north Wales. Why? Well, it's a bit off the beaten track, and I have a thing about beaten tracks. Byways have always seemed to me more interesting than highways, and these particular byways run through the spectacularly beautiful hills and valleys of a part of the country I had never visited before. Second, it is owned and run by a husband-and-wife team, Bryan (chef) and Susan Webb (front of house), and I warm to such family-run enterprises rather more than hyper-restaurants. And third, because I admired Webb's cooking when he was the heart and soul of Hilaire in London, so I was inclined to think that I'd get a decent feed. </p> <p>I had not bargained for how decent that feed was to be. For \u00a323.50, the cost of the three-course fixed-price lunch (I could have had two courses for \u00a317.50, but I've never been a two-course man), I ate salad of pig's trotter with foie gras and celeriac remoulade; roast pigeon with butter beans, girolles and spiced peaches; and wimberry cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. (I also had a cheese course, but that was extra.) However you look at it, that's good value for money. There were other temptations (leek risotto with summer truffles, griddled scallops with vegetable relish, rump of lamb with artichokes, peas and broad beans, and summer pudding with Jersey cream, to name just a few), but each dish in the sequence I chose turned out to be more than even its advertised parts. </p> <p>My first course did not call for far-fetched comparison, odious metaphor or comic outrage, but rather for cultured appreciation and the expression of deep pleasure. The trotter was warm and stuffed with nuggets of its own meat and sweetbreads set in a mousse of the utmost delicacy and richness. A generous slice of seared foie gras piled sensuality on sensuality. The remoulade added its own creamy crunchiness. There were girolles, too, and mixed salad leaves (the healthy part). But it was the sense of sumptuous, velvety textures glossing my mouth, the gentle merging of flavours, that gave this dish its formidable delights. It was tiptop tucker - and if you can't stomach pig's trotter or foie gras, you are a poor, benighted soul. </p> <p>Do you know how much skill it takes to cook a pigeon's leg so that the skin is crisp, almost crunchy, and the flesh succulent yet still detached with ease from the bone? Oodles and oodles. It is one of the reasons why we go to restaurants. And to eat tender, velvety breasts with it. And giant butter beans, vivid green broad beans and girolles like orange trumpets, all sloshing around in grade-A pigeon juices sweetened with spiced peaches, which brought a hint of the exotic to an otherwise earthy combination. </p> <p>Restaurants such as Tyddyn Llan are clear evidence that the industry is in a far healthier state than when I first wrote about it. What's more, there are better and more interesting restaurants outside London than in it. Off the top of my head, I can name the Fat Duck in Berkshire, 5 North Street in Gloucestershire, Juniper in Lancashire, L'Enclume in Cumbria, Hibiscus in Shropshire, Vanilla Pod in Buckinghamshire, all of which produce food of great individuality and panache; many more are working in the same vein. Only Tom Aikens, Rasoi Vineet Bhatia, Thyme and Richard Corrigan in London work at a remotely similar level, though that may be because the cost of setting up a London restaurant - around \u00a32m for even a modest gaff - means the proprietor/chef is in thrall to investors or banks from day one, so can't afford to take risks with anything so recherch\u00e9 as originality. </p> <p>Or course, culinary originality is not the only criterion for judging a restaurant, or even the most important one. People go to different restaurants for different reasons. We do not necessarily want to take our mothers to the same places we'd take our lovers, say, and few of us are likely to treat a Fat Duck or Connaught as a neighbourhood restaurant. Thank heavens that eating in restaurants is no longer seen as the prerogative of the rich or the snobby. I like to think that restaurant criticism has played a part in this, though in truth it owes more to the energy and vision of restaurateurs. </p> <p>And so I came to my final pudding, as a reviewer, which I was talked into by Mrs Webb, wimberries being native to this part of Wales (my instinct had been for the summer pudding, largely on account of the Jersey cream). It was a model of light elegance, the custard quite liquid, the sugar-glazed top like the rime of frost, and the wimberries with an unassertive autumnal flavour not unlike blueberries. And, with a sigh of contentment, that was that. </p> <p>Will I stop going to restaurants now that I have rejoined the ranks of ordinary punters? Most certainly not. I can't think of a form of human activity that is capable of giving so much pleasure in so many diverse ways over so long a period. My only wish for my successor, the ebullient Victor Lewis-Smith, is that he gets as much pleasure out of it as I have had. </p> <p>As I wound my way home, I passed a butcher's. \"Local lamb\", said a sign in the window. I'd have stopped and dashed in for - what? A brace of chops? A shoulder? A kilo of mince? But there was a queue behind me, so I drove on, playing with ideas, combinations, flavours in my head, trying to remember what was in the fridge. What would work well? What would work best? What could I cook to write about? Oh, the sunny upland beckoned. Well, supper did, at any rate.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>Open:</strong> Lunch, Tues-Sat, 12.30-2.15pm; dinner, all week, 7-10pm<br><strong>Menus:</strong> Lunch, \u00a317.50 for two courses, \u00a323.50 for three; dinner, \u00a329.50 for two courses, \u00a335 for three, \u00a340 for four. <br>Wheelchair access and WC.</p>",
  "Doubts about how much plutonium and uranium is contained in a vast waste tank at Sellafield in Cumbria has led the European commission to prosecute the British government for failing to adhere to proper nuclear safeguards. <p>The building, known as B30, is one of the most intractable nuclear waste problems in Europe. </p> <p>An unknown number of nuclear fuel rods and other radioactive detritus has been dumped there over 50 years. </p> <p>The commission claims that for four years its inspectors have been trying to verify how much material is in the pond so that the UK can be seen to have complied with the non-proliferation treaty, which specifies that the material must not be diverted for bomb-making. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry, which has been accused by the commission of dragging its feet, was stunned by the decision, and said that it would study the commission's report before it could comment. </p> <p>The murkiness of the water and the radioactive environment have prevented inspectors assessing the tank's contents. Much of the plutonium is contained in a decaying sludge at the bottom of the pond. </p> <p>British Nuclear Fuels must find a way of removing it safely. </p> <p>In theory, the European court of justice could levy unlimited fines on the UK for failing to comply with Euratom safeguards to prevent diversion of nuclear material for military purposes. </p> <p>It is more likely, however, to wait for a detailed explanation and a plan to deal with the problem before taking action. </p> <p>Europe's energy commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, complained yesterday that Britain had failed to heed her calls over four years to improve access and information about the pond's contents. </p> <p>The only option was to take court action, for the first time, against a member state over nuclear safety.\"I am sure the UK is going to put forward the adequate commitment plan with all the points I have called for,\" she said. </p> <p>She took the action because it would have been \"unfair\" that the 10 members that joined on May 1, mainly from the former Soviet bloc, would have to meet standards than differed from those applied to other EU nations. </p> <p>A DTI spokesman said: \"The government has already set up a decommissioning agency to clean up at Sellafield, but this is not something we will be rushed into. </p> <p>\"There is no suggestion of any leakage. What we are talking about is verifying the exact scale of nuclear material waste deposited in a pond many, many years ago. </p> <p>\"The commission is surely not suggesting the UK authorities may be diverting this material for non-peaceful uses. We know where it is, and we have been analysing with the commission for several years how best to deal with it. But we will not be rushed into any action.\" </p> <p>Caroline Lucas, Green MEP for the south-east of England, said: \"Although inspection visits have been conducted on an annual basis for 15 years, the problem remains the same: inspectors appear to be in the dark over exactly what is in the B30 pond. </p> <p>\"As a result, nobody can be sure whether plutonium or uranium has been diverted for weapons use. </p> <p>\"This is particularly worrying given that it only takes a few kilograms of plutonium to make a nuclear bomb.\"</p>",
  "<p>Feargal Sharkey, once of the Undertones, is a musician and chairman of the government's Live Music Forum. Jem Finer, once of the Pogues, is a composer and musician</p> <p><strong>Hi Jem,</strong> <br>There would appear to be some interesting speculation, at least within the media, as to whether or not the music industry has a future in the light of the internet, downloading, piracy, iPods etc. Personally, I'm not sure if it is a somewhat empty and pointless question.</p> <p>Will music always play a significant role in all our lives? Er, yes! Will that mean, perhaps ironically, certainty for the very people often left out of conversation about music - musicians, songwriters, performers etc - as they try to fill what I suspect will be an almost insatiable demand for music? Er, yes! Will the music industry be a very different place in five years? Er, yes! Is it very different from five, 10 or even 50 years ago? Er, yes! Things change, that's what happens.</p> <p>The Live Music Forum recently released the first set of findings from research conducted by Mori: there have been 1.7m live music events throughout England and Wales in the past year; and 47% of clubs, bars, pubs, hotels, restaurants, student unions, cafes and village halls have staged at least one live music event in the past 12 months.</p> <p>Sounds to me like music is alive and well. So no cause for alarm. Unless, of course, you think differently? <br><strong>Kind regards, Feargal</strong></p> <p><strong>Hi Feargal,</strong><br> I don't think there's any doubt that music has a future and, by implication, that the \"music industry\" has a future. What form that future takes is another matter. I'm not speaking here of musicians and composers, I'm talking about what you might call the music business. To believe the doom-mongers, it's on its last legs, buckling under the onslaught of piracy and illegal downloading. But business always seems to have a knack of surviving by investing in that which it perceives as a threat. Take punk - no way were they going to let all those DIY labels make a killing. Now, in the face of downloaders, there's suddenly a fistful of online retailers selling tracks by the pound.</p> <p>I can't see the music business collapsing, but I think there are interesting possibilities opening up ... the fact that people can not only record their own music but distribute it too, given a computer and broadband.</p> <p>Another thing I wonder about is how downloading music - actually how MP3s - changes the commodification of music. Once people walked around with albums under their arm, part of their uniform. With the MP3 the fetishism is in the player - the iPod, the Rio, mobile phones ...</p> <p>I find it hard to believe that the recording as a physical object will die out, but maybe that's what we're witnessing the beginning of. I hope not ! <br><strong>Cheers, Jem</strong></p> <p><strong>Dear Jem, </strong><br> Agreed, the large companies will always survive one way or another, so for them the end is not in sight; it will just be different.</p> <p>I spend a lot of time working with small independent labels (I sit on the board of Aim, the Association of Independent Music) and it can get pretty disheartening for them - you release something and in days it's available for free all over the net. Not necessarily the best business model imaginable. The ones at the bottom of the food chain, the musicians and performers, lose out. According to the Musicians' Union, 60% of musicians earn less than \u00a310,000 a year. The Performing Rights Society tells me that 94% of their songwriter/composer members earn less than \u00a310,000 a year in royalty income. </p> <p>I think a lot more people need to understand that this is not just about large, soulless multinationals - by stealing music, they are taking money from the musician round the corner.</p> <p>Sure, the DIY route might be the answer for some people, but Apple is already on record saying that iTunes does not make money; selling iPods does. I've spent a lot of time trying to find a way to run a record company based on the 50p a company might get from each download, and I can't get it to work.</p> <p>I saw some quite interesting information from Ofcom a few weeks ago about \"the iPod generation\". Audiences appear to be growing increasingly dissatisfied with repetitive playlists; they want to hear new and more varied music, have access to more specialist content as well as new, local acts and talent. If iPods and the internet are driving that kind of interest, then it can only be a good thing.</p> <p>Wonder how many radio stations have picked up on it yet, though? <br><strong>Kind regards, Feargal</strong></p> <p><strong>Hello there,</strong><br> Resonance (104.4 FM or <a href=\"http://resonancefm.com/\">resonancefm.com</a>), run by the London Musicians Collective for more than two years, does all the things you mention and more. It has no playlist, no rules (except for limits on swearing and mocking the monarchy, as laid down by the license authority). As a touchstone for the future of music, its programming makes an interesting study.</p> <p>There's always been a lot more going on in music than \"pop\", and there have always been other motives for making music aside from trading anonymity for celebrity. While Alan Freed was coining the phrase rock'n'roll and Ike Turner writing Rocket 88 in 1951, John Cage was composing Imaginary Landscape #4, for 12 radios. A year later he composed 4'33\", his \"silent\" piece, and at a stroke blew music's boundaries apart. It was never going to make the mainstream, but one can see a thread weaving its way through the last 50 years and on into the future, touching the myriad weird and wonderful sonic forms that exist on the margins. I don't know how many of the live events you mention are of an \"experimental\" nature, but I'd wager that they're on the increase. <br><strong>Cheers, Jem</strong></p> <p><strong>Hi Jem,</strong><br> Ah, Resonance FM. Listen to it quite a lot - unfortunately not available outside of London, though.</p> <p>If I knew the form music will take, I wouldn't be typing this - I'd be in some record company office relieving them of my excessively modest fee. Having said that, I do try to be the eternal optimist. I'm totally convinced that there is someone, right now, sitting in the spare bedroom of a council flat in Huddersfield that has it totally and completely sussed. Another punk rock might not be a bad thing. Anything but bloody banjo music. <br><strong>Kind regards, Feargal</strong></p> <p><strong>Dear Feargal,</strong><br> Resonance FM may have a range of five miles from its central London aerial, but its reach on the net is global. There's a new \"punk rock\" for you - the democratisation of the airwaves. Anyone can set up a stream on the internet for a few hundred quid and around the world more and more people do. That will only proliferate. It might not be the best business model, but if one's interest is in making something available to be heard, it's not hard.</p> <p>Musicians have always made music to fill whatever format exists. First the 78, then the 7in single, on through the LP to the CD. Compositions got longer. Some people remake existing work - Gavin Bryars for example - in expanded versions. So now, given the DVD, can we expect compositions of even greater duration?</p> <p>That's only the beginning, though. Hard disks can hold enormous amounts of music, data compression expands that, generative forms lead to endless, endless possibilities. Music that creates itself, that responds to environment, mood ... uncommodifiable!</p> <p>Listen out, Feargal, for my new everlasting banjo composition. Ring a ling ding ding dang ding dang dong. :-) <br><strong>Cheers, Jem</strong></p>",
  "<p> Scotland's evening may have ended in farce, snuffed out after an hour by a floodlight failure, then drowned in a Spanish monsoon, but Berti Vogts will be mightily encouraged. Unfancied and braced for a battering, his team excelled here and will go into next week's World Cup qualifier with Slovenia on a high. </p> <p>That the night ended with the Estadio Ciudad de Valencia stadium flooding, the fierce electrical storm having already disabled the local grid to extinguish the lights, merely added a surreal twist. </p> <p>The Tartan Army, drenched but tickled by the fiasco, are used to seeing slick counter-attacks from a tactically sound side outplay a disjointed team. They are just not accustomed for Scotland to be dishing it out. </p> <p>Rarely can Vogts' team have played better away from home. They adjusted swiftly to the wind - howling in off the coast and straight at their goal, bringing the fateful storm with it - and could arguably have been four up at the interval, so incisive were they on the break. </p> <p>While Spain spluttered, their impetus forever fizzling out as the goalkeeper Craig Gordon hove into view, the Scots eased into a hugely deserved lead. </p> <p>Carlos Puyol's scrambled clearance from Barry Ferguson's free-kick, which arced over Iker Casillas towards the empty net, proved to be a mere warning shot. The home defence was still panicked at James McFadden's resultant corner, the Evertonian's vicious centre flicking off Ruben Baraja and in.</p> <p>With Raul and Fernando Morientes warming up on the touchline, Asier del Horno might have squeezed Spain level with a close-range header, but Stevie Crawford - twice released by clever Darren Fletcher touches - should have extended the Scots' lead. Casillas blocked both attempts. The Plymouth striker should not have given him the chance. </p> <p>\"We were so well organised,\" said Vogts in the sodden aftermath. \"We had outstanding performances in every department. I know it was only a friendly but it will fill us with so much confidence.\" </p> <p>Spain perked up marginally after the interval, but their equaliser came with their first genuine chance. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes clipped the substitute Raul to the byline then charged on to the pull-back, only for a combination of Jackie McNamara and Andy Webster to send him sprawl ing. Raul tucked away the penalty - and that was it. </p> <p> <strong> Spain </strong> (4-4-2): Casillas; Lopez Rekarte, Marchena (Helguera, 58), Puyol, Del Horno; Joaquin, Xabi Alonso, Baraja (Vicente, h-t), Reyes; Tamudo (Raul, h-t), Torres (Valeron, h-t). </p> <p><strong> Subs not used: </strong> Canizares, Salgado, Romero, Albelda, Morientes, Victor, Juanito. </p> <p><strong> Scotland </strong> (4-1-4-1): Gordon; G Caldwell, Webster, Mackay, Naysmith; McNamara; Fletcher (Cameron, 58), Ferguson, Quashie, McFadden (Pearson, h-t); Crawford (Miller, 58). </p> <p><strong> Subs not used: </strong> Shearer, Thompson, Dickov, McNamee, Holt, Kyle. </p> <p><strong> Booked: </strong> Naysmith, Crawford, Quashie, Webster. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> S Br\u00e9 (France).</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's governors have appointed a senior civil servant as the head of a new powerbase intended to underpin their independence from the corporation's managers. </p> <p>Nicholas Kroll, the deputy permanent secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, will take up the position of director of governance on October 1. </p> <p>Michael Grade, the BBC chairman, announced in June that a governance department would help to ensure the governors were seen to act separately of the management, providing independent advice and analysis of executives' proposals and decisions. </p> <p>There was widespread criticism that the governors had been too quick to support the BBC's management during the David Kelly affair last year, which led to the departure of the former chairman Gavyn Davies and the then director, general, Greg Dyke. </p> <p>Mr Grade, who succeeded Mr Davies, had said the director of governance would be \"a senior figure of weight and authority, with the skills and experience to provide reliable and independent support to the board of governors\". </p> <p>Mr Kroll and his department will report solely to the board of governors, whose present support staff also report to the BBC director general. </p> <p>There had been speculation that the post would be filled by a broadcasting industry figure, but Mr Grade had already announced the appointment of one of the leading names in the frame, ITN's former editor in chief Richard Tait, as a BBC governor earlier this year. </p> <p>On the appointment of Mr Kroll yesterday, the governors moved to allay concerns about having a government placeman at the heart of the corporation, by stressing that he had applied for the position and was the outstanding candidate from a strong field. </p> <p>Mr Grade said: \"After a thorough and open competition, Nicholas Kroll was the governors' unanimous choice. His intellectual rigour, broadcasting and wider public policy experience, and proven independence and objectivity, will prove invaluable in setting up and directing the new governance unit.\" </p> <p>Mr Kroll, 50, has spent his career in the civil service, joining the Department of the Environment in 1977 after graduating from Oxford University. He has spent the past decade at the heart of broadcasting policy: between 1995 and 1996 he was head of the culture department's broadcast policy unit. </p> <p>He gave a firm commitment yesterday to his support for the BBC's governors as the best way of ensuring the corporation's independence from ministerial meddling. </p> <p>\"I strongly believe that the BBC's system of governance is the right system for maintaining a BBC that operates in the public interest and is independent from political and commercial pressures,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The changes announced by the board in June to modernise the way in which the governors execute their responsibilities will ensure the British public continues to receive and enjoy the BBC it wants and deserves.\" </p> <p>Mr Kroll's first task will be to set up the governance department. </p> <p>Separately, Mr Grade has appointed a former BBC executive as an independent adviser to the board of governors. </p> <p>Peter Ibbotson, who was editor of Panorama during the controversy of Maggie's Militant Tendency programme, will advise the governors on issues relating to the review of the corporation's royal charter.</p>",
  "<p>For time-pressed employers, traditional recruiting methods are not always the best option. And as the pressure grows to find top calibre employees, under a growing mountain of applications, graduate recruiters are turning to some increasingly unusual techniques. The result? A ragbag of new methods they hope will speed up the process or make it more accurate.</p> <p>Fittingly, the latest development in the battle for speed is inspired by speed-dating - a recent phenomena which allows busy 'singletons' to cram several romantic encounters into a one hour session. When it comes to recruitment, the same logic is applied. Rather than commit hours to applying for one company, why not meet five separate recruiters in one hour-long slot?</p> <p>Among the pioneers is Reed Consulting, which last month held what it claims was the country's first speed-recruitment event. \"The concept is very much based on the idea of speed dating,\" says spokeswoman Becky Remmington. \"In speed dating people meet each other for a few minutes to see how they feel about each other. We worked on the same kind of idea for speed recruitment. It's very much a two way process, where the employee and the recruiter can find out a bit about each other, before they commit to a full job interview.\"</p> <p>Here's how it works. Graduates who have signed up for the event are given forms with which to rate the employers, with answers ranging from \"not interested\" to \"very interested\". The employers have a copy of the graduate's CV and a photograph. During the process, graduates spend ten minutes with each recruiter before a whistle blows, and it's time to move on.</p> <p>To cynics it sounds like a gimmick. But 'speed recruitee' Josh Nyamn sings its praises. \"You can spend a long time filling out online application forms, and never even get to meet the people who might be employing you,\" he explains.</p> <p>\"But with speed recruitment you get to actually meet five people who have the power to hire you.\" Josh also sees it as an effective way for less confident people to sell themselves. \"If you're very nervous at interview then this is a fantastic way to build up confidence,\" he says. \"You're getting five employers in sharp bursts, and by the time you get to the last one you can't fail to be more confident.\"</p> <p>Psychology graduate Mark Weller was also impressed by the concept. \"I'm interested in finance jobs, but I did a psychology degree,\" explains Mark. \"It might look to some employers that I don't have the maths skills they might be looking for. But as part of my psychology degree I did lots of analytical stuff, which I think would be equally valuable. You just can't explain that on paper.\"</p> <p>For employers also, the process is an innovative way to meet graduates who have already been vetted to meet their criteria. \"We get a lot of people applying to us across the board,\" says Abbi Eustace, who represented Barclays Bank at the event. \"The speed recruitment event gave us the opportunity to see a diverse range of people in a short amount of time. In terms of how we'll use it in the future? It's early days, but we certainly saw some people who were of high quality.\"</p> <p>But speed recruitment is just one of the innovative techniques with which employers are experimenting to assess possible recruits and automate the boring bits out of the recruitment process. With technological advancements like instant messaging, for example, recruiters are catching onto the benefits of being able to chat online in real time to several graduates at once. The idea has been piloted on the website by <a href=\"http://www.doctorjob.com\">www.doctorjob.com</a> which has been hosting a series of online chat sessions for graduates and employers. \"We've seen massive increases in students taking part in the online chats,\" says Doctor Job's Mark Blythe.</p> <p>\"We've got a number of blue-chip companies who take part in the discussion, and we can book them in for certain sessions - so students will know that a recruiter from IBM, for example, will be online between 4pm and 6pm.\" The process allows employers to get as much information out as possible to students, in the hope of increasing applicant numbers. And for students, the chance to ask some forthright questions is invaluable.</p> <p>At some stage, technology could even automate recruitment to a level which makes more than one online application unnecessary. \"We haven't got there yet, but we might see a method whereby universities have a common application system, so graduates only have to fill out an application form once,\" says Mark Blythe. \"It would take a long time to get recruiters to agree on criteria, but I can certainly see it as a possibility.\"</p> <p>But while technology will continue to play a part in recruiting methods of the future, many employers are looking to less hi-tech solutions - such as handwriting analysis. Erik Rees, a professionally qualified graphologist works with employers wishing to analyse the hand writing of potential employees. \"I have worked with many companies who use graphology to analyse potential employees,\" says Erik.</p> <p>\"Graphology is not as popular in the UK as in the rest of Europe, but this is changing. I have many corporate clients who use handwriting analysis as part of their recruitment process. Graphologists would never analyse the handwriting of anyone's who had not consented to the analysis - so employees are always made aware of this.\"</p> <p>For straight-out innovation and creative recruiting, advertising agency Grey London deserves a special mention. The firm has used contacts at Channel Four to secure them the Big Brother house as an interviewing environment. Short-listed candidates take part in team exercises in the house, while recruiters from Grey observe from viewing areas.</p> <p>\"We get so many people applying, and we want to make sure they're really thinking about the company,\" says account director Justin Baines. \"Obviously we want to make sure we get the pick, and the Big Brother house is actually a surprisingly good way to get candidates interacting naturally. And of course, it also means we can call people into the diary room if we think they aren't performing their best.\"</p> <p>Of course, the traditional methods of recruitment won't disappear. And graduates should be careful that they're assessing the job they're applying for - not the recruiting process itself. \"If you go to something like speed recruitment and it's an innovative environment, you may be seeing the company in this context rather than building realistic expectations of what the job involves,\" warns Andy Davidson of the Institute of Employment Studies.</p> <p>\"What really works time after time is part-time working and internships. These give students and graduates a much better idea of what working for a company involves, and enables them to establish proper relations with their employer.</p> <p>\"There really are no shortcuts.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mailquinn@yahoo.co.uk\"> mailquinn@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "A southern Italian mayor who opposes the building of a bridge between Sicily and the mainland has resigned after a campaign of intimidation blamed on local mobsters. <p>Rocco Cassone, the civic chief in Villa San Giovanni, has had his car set on fire twice. Last month he received a death threat in the form of a letter containing bullets. </p> <p>He said in a statement: \"The conditions do not exist with which to guarantee normal administrative activity.\" </p> <p>His departure has highlighted fears that the project could enrich the Calabrian 'ndrangheta, a crime syndicate that rivals the Sicilian Cosa Nostra as Italy's most dangerous mafia. </p> <p>Villa San Giovanni, across the strait of Messina from the coast of Sicily, in the 'ndrangheta's heartland, appears destined to become caught up in one of Europe's biggest building projects. Plans envisage a suspension bridge with a span of more than two miles. </p> <p>In April, after intense lobbying by Silvio Berlusconi's government in Rome, the European parliament gave the go-ahead for the scheme to qualify for EU funding, overriding objections by critics that it is not only environmental unfriendly but unsafe. The bridge will be in an earthquake zone and near an active volcano, Etna. </p> <p>For the 'ndrangheta on one side of the strait and the Cosa Nostra on the other, however, the project holds out the prospect of vast rake-offs from the cash that will flow into the area. The cost of the bridge, due for completion in 2015, is put at \u20ac5.6bn (about \u00a33.8bn). </p> <p>The 'ndrangheta, once no more than a network of local hoodlums, has acquired growing resources and influence from its involvement in the Latin American drugs trade. </p> <p>Mr Berlusconi's government recently earmarked \u20ac300m for preliminary building work in Messina and Villa San Giovanni. But Mr Cassone and his governing centre-left group on the council have remained staunchly opposed to a scheme they fear is bad for the town and the environment. </p> <p>Hinting at local connivance in the intimidation campaign against him, Mr Cassone said: \"I find it incredible that an envelope stamped and postmarked and containing five bullets can get through [the post] in the normal way.\"</p>",
  "Three hostage-takers were reported to have been captured alive last night after nine hours of bloody gunfights in the Beslan school which left up to 200 hostages dead, many of them children. <p>An Ossetian official said the three had been caught trying to flee in civilian clothes. But there were reports that one militant was still holding out inside the school buildings with hostages. Two others were said to be at large. Another 27 hostage-takers were reported to have been killed.</p> <p>The casualty toll mounted steadily. Ninety-five of the dead had been identified late last night. Around 700 had been wounded, of which at least 320 were children, Lev Dzujawed, a spokesman for the president of North Ossetia, said.</p> <p>The remains of many bodies were thought to buried in the embers of the school gym which had been mined by the hostage-takers. President Vladimir Putin's adviser on Chechnya, Aslanbek Aslak-hanov, warned the death toll could rise dramatically.</p> <p>Speaking about the tragedy at a rally in West Allis, Wisconson, George Bush said: \"This is yet another grim reminder of the length to which terrorists will go to threaten this civilised world. We mourn the innocent lives that have been lost, we stand with the people of Russia; we send them our prayers for this terrible situation.\"</p> <p>In a letter to Mr Putin Tony Blair said: \"I have been closely watching the terrible developments in North Ossetia. It is hard to express my revulsion at the inhumanity of terrorists prepared to put children and their families through such suffering. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, the families and friends of those killed, those injured and all of the Russian people.\"</p> <p>In a personal message the Queen expressed her \"profound shock at the events\" and asked Mr Putin to give her \"deepest sympathy to the bereaved and injured\".</p> <p>Twenty militants were killed in gunfights with security forces, 10 of them Arabs, Valery Andreyev, the region's Federal Security Service chief, said.</p> <p>Speculation raged about who was responsible for the three-day siege, with Russian officials pointing the finger at al-Qaida.</p> <p>Briefing Russian journalists, an agent from the regional security service named the leader of the group as Magomed \"Magas\" Yevloyev, a commander with the Chechen resistance said to be subordinate to the powerful Chechen leader Shamil Basayev.</p> <p>Mr Yevloyev was blamed by pro-government Chechen officials in June for an attack on government buildings in the republic of Ingushetia, the region between North Ossetia and Chechnya, which left scores dead.</p> <p>There is likely to be more interest in Mr Basayev's role in the attack and the apparent involvement of Arab fighters.</p> <p>The same FSB source who identified Mr Yevloyev claimed that the Beslan operation was \"financed by one of the ideologues of Wahhabism, Abu Omar As-Seif\".</p> <p>Russia has claimed ever since the Chechen conflict erupted 10 years ago that it was being fuelled from Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The FSB described As-Seif yesterday as the representative of al-Qaida in Chechnya and distributor of foreign funds to the Chechen resistance.</p> <p>There is no doubt that in more than 10 years of conflict a number of Arabs have joined the ranks of Chechens fighting the Russian authorities, and that, as the secular, socially liberal, Soviet-educated older generation of Chechen rebels has lost ground, Arab fighters and Islamicised Chechens have become more powerful within the anti-Russian movement.</p> <p>Mr Basayev belongs to the older generation but he trained in Afghanistan and from the earliest days of the Chechen rebellion has inclined to more radical tactics .</p> <p>Yet the extent of foreign involvement in the Chechen rebel movement remains obscure.</p> <p>Most of the claims and names come from Russian security sources, which have a vested interest in demonstrating to the rest of the world that they are fighting against a global Islamist assault.</p> <p>Together with Mr Basayev and two other Chechens, the report identified the Saudi-born Abu Walid as a key leader of the radical wing of the Chechen rebels, those who favour hostage-taking and suicide bombing.</p> <p>Abu Walid is thought to be the deputy of the late Khattab, a Chechen rebel leader from Jordan responsible for a series of military successes against Russian forces, who died in mysterious circumstances in 2001.</p> <p>The pro-Russian Chechen authorities believe Abu Walid and As-Seif clashed in 2002 over the right to inherit Khattab's mantle, including command of Arab fighters in the rebel movement.</p>"
