  "<p><strong>9.35pm </strong>Paul Hamm gets the gold in the gymnastics. A brilliant last round sees him become the first American man to win the all-round competition. South Korean duo Kim Dae-eun and Yang Tae-young have to settle for silver and bronze respectively. A great night's action, probably better to watch than read about. </p> <p>Oh, and in (non-Olympic) baseball Barry Bonds is closing in on Babe Ruth's total number of home runs. Hank Aaron holds the record, everyone knows that. Anyway, I have a website to edit, so will bid you farewell, thanks for all the (six) emails. Cheers, Tom.</p> <p> <strong>9.25pm </strong>What a night at the gymnastics. Paul Hamm has clawed his way back to third, behind Brett McClure, also of America, and a South Korean whose name escapes me leads (poor journalism). Yang Wei is down in fourth after slipping on the high bar. Can no one hold a lead in the Olympics? Ravi emails back to confirm he is from India. Brilliant detective work from me.</p> <p>Richard from New York writes to ask why we're not discussing Barry Bonds closing in on Babe Ruth's home run record. Well, we are now, Dicky. Go, Barry.</p> <p> <strong>9.10pm</strong> Ha, Costa Rica have knocked Portugal out of the football, storming to a 4-2 victory. Alex Ferguson will be pleased that Ronaldo's trip to Greece was completely wasted.</p> <p>Ravichandra Ramineni writes in to nominate his nation as the worst at the Olympics: 1 billion people and one silver medal. But he doesn't say what nation he's from. 1 billion people and an Indian sounding name? I'm guessing India.</p> <p>Yang Wei now heads the gymnastics ahead of Ioan Silviu Sucliu of Romania. </p> <p><strong>8.55pm </strong>Heralded by cries of \"Rubbish!\" around the Guardian office, Paul Hamm crumples on landing on the vault and slips from first to fifth in the men's gymnastics. He looks gutted. Kieron Dyer knows how he feels, he's being booed everytime he touches the ball in the (non-Olympic) football.</p> <p><strong>8.46pm</strong> Amazing. My trip to the canteen has yielded a beef ghoulash with no beef. What do you have to do to get a decent meal around here? And I've managed to cut my finger. Bah, what would Leslie have to say about this travesty? Over in the men's gymnastics America's Paul Hamm leads the all-round event from Yang Wei of China. </p> <p>The medals ceremony for the equestrian team event goes ahead. Princess Anne (she does a lot of work for charity) hands over the medals to her horsey chums. Bit of confusion as the riders try and figure out whether the laurel rings go over their helmets or under them. Why are they still wearing their helmets anyway? Do they fear a royal beating? The camera pans to a sinister huddle of Americans and Frenchmen plotting an appeal against golden girl Bettina Hoy.</p> <p>Clare Balding joins Leslie in the judge-bashing and says a pony club could organise a better event. Go Clare, give it to them girlfriend.</p> <p><strong>8.34pm </strong> Oh, and England are one-nil up in the (non-Olympic) football, if anyone is interested. David Beckham scuffing one home.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong> By god, emails! Richard Noble decides to put in a bit of the Leslie Laws and complains about Canada's measly medal haul - a rather pathetic one bronze from a nation of 30m people beefed up on a diet of bear meat and maple syrup. You have my complete sympathy, Richard. Anybody else like to nominate a nation of under-achievers?</p> <p><strong>8.10 pm </strong>Australia have beaten Japan 97-78 in the women's basketball and top their group, USA have proved to be better than their bumbling male colleagues and powered to victory against South Korea.</p> <p> <strong>7.55pm </strong>Leslie Law is interviewed after his triumph and doesn't look too pleased. He grumbles about the officials and judging. Cheer up, man, you're a national hero. </p> <p><strong>7.52pm </strong> Plucky Chinese weightlifter Zhang Guozheng has taken gold in the 69kg category despite straining his back. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back at the hotbed of intrigue and subterfuge that calls itself the showjumping competition, our very own Leslie Law moves ahead of Pippa Funnell after a clear final round and swipes himself a shiny silver, after the Frenchman who was in first completely bottles it. Amazing. God bless our toffs! Whirlwind of controversy Bettina Hoy finishes with the gold. Please let this be the end of the matter.</p> <p><strong>7.33pm </strong>Bah, the powers that be in the equestrian world have decided that Bettina Hoy is innocent of any horse-related chicanery and Germany have been reinstated in gold medal position, so we're down to bronze again. America and France have forgotten their squabble over Iraq and have launched a counter appeal. Like Patrick Vieira transfer rumours this one could run and run...</p> <p><strong>7.20pm</strong> Equestrian update: Germany have appealed against Bettina Hoy's points deduction, but for now the British team have the silver medal and Pippa Funnell is on for a bronze in the individual competition. Who says there's no point in the aristocracy?</p> <p><strong>7.10pm </strong>The USA smash the world record to win the women's 200m freestyle relay, with China in second and Germany in third. Britain finish a respectable fifth. In the women's badminton semi-finals Mia Audina of the Netherlands beats Gong Ruina of China 11-4 11-2 and Zhang Ning beat her Chinese compatriot Zhou Mi 11-6 11-4.</p> <p><strong>6.45 pm </strong>Michael Phelps eases to a win in the first semi-final of the 200m medley, while Laszlo Cseh takes the second one ahead of George Bovel, who continues Trinidad's proud swimming tradition. GB's Adrian Turner comes home in eighth. Adrian Moorhouse reckons Phelps will take the gold easily in the final.</p> <p><strong>6.30pm </strong>What a fantastic race. Pieter van den Hoogenband takes the gold, Roland Mark Schoeman the silver, and the Thorpedo the bronze. Schoeman was ahead on world record time at the turn, but tired near the end to allow Van den Hoogenband to clinch it in the final stroke. Thorpe came back from eighth at the turn to snatch third place. Van den Hoogenband looks almost as chuffed as me after my tips in the previous update.</p> <p>It has been confirmed that Germany have been docked 12 penalty points in the three-day eventing, meaning Britain officially have the silver medal. We await to see if Germany appeal.</p> <p><strong>6.20pm </strong> It seems the German rider Bettina Hoy has been docked 12 points for crossing the start-line twice during the showjumping, pushing her team down to fourth. \"Crossing the start-line twice?\" I hear you say. No, I don't quite understand either. The Germans have the right to appeal, though, so watch this space.</p> <p>Polish swimmer Otylia Jedrzejczek (it's at times like these I'm glad I'm not a commentator) has won the 200m butterfly. It's the big one coming up now - the 100m freestyle for men. The field is wide open, though Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband are the pre-race favourites. Roland Mark Schoeman is a good outside bet for South Africa.</p> <p><strong>6.05pm </strong> Great Britain have been awarded the silver medal in the three-day eventing. The whole affair is shrouded in mystery at present, but Germany have been wiped from the leaderboard, pushing France into gold medal position, and Britain into second. As Barry Davies once famously said: \"Where were the Germans? Quite frankly, who cares?\" I'll let you know the explanation when I find out.</p> <p>In the pool, James Goddard has produced another excellent swim to win his semi-final in the 200m backstroke by a full body-length, breaking the British record (1:57.25) while he was at it. However, he will struggle to win the final, as there he will come up against American Adam Peirsol, who set an Olympic record (1:55.14) in the second semi-final.</p> <p>Ben Atherton, meanwhile, is livid. \"Arrch, I hate the phrase Team GB,\" he begins. \"It's so weak and pathetic, kind of like something Tim Henman might support - Go Team! Yeah! Rubbish.\" Yes, Ben, I see your point, and I will subsequently refrain from using it again.</p> <p><strong>5.50pm </strong> Jonathan Wood says this: \"I can't believe I'm the only one who thinks Paula Radcliffe is gorgeous.\" Well, I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say \"gorgeous\", Jonathan. Mind you, my colleague Rob Smyth reckons she looked \"radiant\" on the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show. </p> <p>Speaking of \"radiant\", Venus Williams has just been knocked out of the women's singles, losing 6-4, 6-4 to Mary Pierce.</p> <p>Ooh, and a world record to tell you about in the pool: Aussie Jodie Henry has just set a new best in the second semi-final of the 100m freestyle with a time of 53.52. She looked as shocked as everyone else.</p> <p><strong>5.40pm </strong> Japan's Kosuke Kitajima has won the men's breaststroke 200m final, his second gold medal of the Games after his win in the 100m. Daniel Gyurta was second for Hungary, and Brendan Hansen third for America. There were no Britons in the race, but we have James Goddard and Gregor Tait coming up shortly in the men's 200m backstroke semi-finals - both looked impressive in the heats this morning.</p> <p>Julie O'Neill says regarding the UK Olympic top totty: \"There's no contest, it's got to be James Cracknell.\" I'll take your word for it, Julie.</p> <p><strong>5.25pm</strong> \"Surely for 2012 we could push for the inclusion of mixed doubles synchronized archery horseback riding?\" Ben Roome, this does indeed sound the perfect sport for team GB. Richard Frampton has plumped for British triathlete Jodie Swallow (I'll leave the obvious gags to you) for his pick of the British girls, while Geoff Spick goes for Lauren Jackson, who is actually in the Aussie women's basketball team, and therefore doesn't strictly qualify for this category. </p> <p>By the way, nothing is happening at the moment, but the swimming is coming up soon, with the men's and women's 100m freestyle finals, and the women's 4x200m freestyle relay - in which we have a realistic chance of a medal - to look forward to.</p> <p><strong>5.08pm </strong> Barnaby Champman has posed an interesting question, asked in true Men Behaving Badly style: \"Top UK Olympic totty?\" Leonie Pendred thought Nathan Robertson was a fitty, and Barnaby reckons his partner Gail Emms is the best British candidate. They are clearly quite the handsome couple. Any other views? </p> <p>'Desperate' Phil Walker, on the other hand, wants to know: \"If the olympics had medals for 4th and 5th places, what do people think they should be made of (tin and wood perhaps), and how many more medals would GB have - my guess is loads judging by all the near misses we are getting.\" Maybe, but our athletes would probably contrive to finish sixth just to ensure they narrowly miss out on medals - there's nothing we Brits like more than a glorious failure.</p> <p>So I can't be accused of providing you purely with meaningless chit-chat, Yuriy Silonog has won the men's shot put final, beating American Adam Nelson into second.</p> <p><strong>4.55pm </strong> More good news from the sailing venue at Piraeus. The British teams lead in three classes and are second in one other. Ben Ainslie maintained his lead with a third place this afternoon, while his nearest rival, Spaniard Rafael Trujillo, was disqualified. Shirley Robertson, Sarah Ayton and Sarah Webb are seven points clear in the gold medal position in the Yngling class. And Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield finished third in their second race of the day to move six points ahead of the USA duo. Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks, meanwhile, have moved into second in the mixed 49er on their second day of competition.</p> <p>Andy Roddick has become the latest tennis superstar to be knocked out, losing in straight sets to Fernando Gonzalez, of Chile, in the third round. With Roger Federer already eliminated, the men's singles is wide open. If only Tim Henman was still in, eh?</p> <p><strong>4.38pm </strong> <strong> BRONZE MEDAL FOR GREAT BRITAIN</strong> Well, they didn't get the gold, but the British three-day eventing team has had an excellent result by winning the bronze medal after being out of contention just half an hour ago. American Kimberly Severson hit the last fence to give the Brits third place, while Frenchman Nicolas Touzaint did likewise to gift the gold to Germany, for whom Bettina Hoy rode a perfect round. Oh, and my colleagues now think I'm a bit odd because I was shouting at the television cheering our girls and boys on. Nothing wrong with a bit of patriotic spirit, that's what I say! Pippa Funnell goes into the final round of the individual showjumping tonight with a chance of a medal. She is in fourth place overall, with Leslie law in fifth. This is proving to be quite a day.</p> <p><strong>4.28pm </strong> Pippa Funnell has had an outstanding double clear run on Primmore's Pride and William Fox Pitt has declared we are still in with a chance of a team gold (yes, gold) medal in the showjumping. All the other contenders are dropping like flies, and if any of the three riders to go hit a fence, we are guaranteed a medal. Exciting. Funnell also has a chance for an individual medal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sam Wingfield is taking up a new career. \"Inspired by the bronze medal glory in archery me and a mate have just gone down the bus station with a beer mat,\" he says. \"Wish us luck.\" Best of British, Sam, or perhaps, just good luck.</p> <p><strong>4.18pm </strong> The cycling had indeed begun, in fact, it's actually just finished. Tyler Hamilton has taken the gold.</p> <p>Andrew Goldsby wants to know what we are going to do when we run out of excuses over Britain's poor performances. \"From the coverage I saw yesterday the three day horsey stuff went to pot because the cross country course didn't suit British horses and it was hot. Should we get the games in 2012 just who exactly are we going to blame?\" Good question. The likelihood is though that we won't get the Games, then we'll just be able to blame absolute everyone - it could be the biggest conspiracy theory of all time. </p> <p> <strong>4.05pm </strong> <strong>BRONZE MEDAL FOR GREAT BRITAIN</strong> Alison Williamson has beaten Chinese Taipei's Shu Chi Yuan 105-104 to win the archery 70m bronze medal in her fourth Olympics. To hit the bullseye is like hitting a beer mat from seven buses away apparently. I think it's easier to pitcure it by saying it's 70m. Anyway, Williamson did it very often, so well done to her.</p> <p>Britain's Leslie Law has had a double clear run in the showjumping, meaning we are still in with a chance of a team bronze medal with Pippa Funnell the last rider to go.</p> <p>The first athletics medal of the Games has been won by Irina Korzhanenko of Russia in the women's shot put. Oh, and the men's cycling time trial has begun with Jan Ulrich and Tyler Hamilton two of the favourites.</p> <p><strong>3.51pm </strong> The showjumping is not going well at all. Since the commentator said he wanted the Germans to fail miserably, they have gone from strength to strength and and to the top of the leaderboard. The French are faltering with America breathing down their necks in the hunt for second place. Britain remain fourth, with Australia close behind. There are two riders to go for each team.</p> <p>Bruce Jackson has unwittingly come up with a way of making archery an even more watchable sport. \"This one-on-one archery business,\" he begins. \"Do they line up 70m apart with balloons full of coloured dye attached to themselves? Then start loosing off arrows until one of them starts leaking a red colour?\" They don't, Bruce, but it's a mighty fine idea. Maybe you should contact the IOC and suggest it for Beijing 2008.</p> <p>Winston Gordon's semi-final conqueror, Zurab Zviadauri, has beaten small Japanese martial expert Hiroshi Izumi with another ippon to win the gold medal.</p> <p><strong>3.42pm </strong> Not an update for British cheer I'm afraid. Alison Williamson has lost her archery semi-final 110-100 to the Korean Park, despite her best performance of the Games so far. Williamson now faces Shu Chi Yuan in a battle for a bronze medal, while the final will be an all Korean affair.</p> <p>Winston Gordon has lost his judo bronze medal play-off with Mark Huizinga, of Holland, after the Dutchman achieved an ippon in the 90kg category.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm </strong> Hello again everybody. The showjumping is the key event of the afternoon, it being the third day of the three-day eventing and all. Medals will be dished out later, and Britain lay in fourth going into the day with Pippa Funnell leading team GB. The BBC commentator has just said he hopes those teams above us start losing time and pick up penalty points, including the Germans. Not sure such tub-thumping is necessary. Anyway, as of yet it hasn't happened, and it looks like Britain will miss out on the medals despite supposedly having the best riders and the best horses.</p> <p>Archer Alison Williamson's semi-final, and the chance to win a medal is up soon, but it won't be easy as her opponent, Sung Hyun Park, is the favourite for the title.</p> <p>Meanwhile, someone certainly agrees that badminton is sexy. \"Move aside Beckham!\" orders Leonie Pendred. \"Nathan (Robertson) is a FITTY!! And when he does that jumping smash, phwoooar!\" Well, quite.</p> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong> This is a moment for Professor Robert Winston if ever I stumbled across one: neanderthal man has just emailed me! \"I always thought badmington was what you did at school for P.E. if you were too soft for real man sport like rugger and soccer outside,\" says Tom Gray. \"Who cares if we get a gold medal.\" I've been advised that the best way to communicate with Tom is \"ug ug ug.\" </p> <p>Back to horsey business, Jeanette Brakewell is currently in second in the showjumping after picking up only four faults and finishing within time.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the judo Winston Gordon has missed out on the silver or gold thanks to some Georgian fellow, and will have to buck his ideas up to fight it out for the bronze. </p> <p>That's it from me, Mike Adamson will be back at 3.30pm. Cheerio.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> In classic Henman fashion Robertson's reined in the anger and used it to their advantage, fist pumping his way from 8-5 down to 12-12 and then the Brits pulled away to take the match with a 15-12 second game win. That's at least silver in the bag! Fist pump-o-rama!</p> <p>\"Am I mad or have I woken up in an alternate dimension where badminton is cool hip and sexy?\" asks Jason Moncrieff. There's a medal in it Jason, badminton will now be cool hip and sexy for at least the next four years.</p> <p>America's Kim Rhode has won gold in the women's double trap, by the way. I thought you'd be wondering.</p> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong> Alison Williamson's gone through in the archery, beating He Ying 109-89. The Chinese archer took her ninth arrow out of turn, and while protesting at missing out on her highest score as a penalty, she missed her 10th. Oh dear.</p> <p>In the badminton the Brits stormed to win 15-6 in the first game, but they're 8-5 down in the second - an iffy decision has prompted Nathan's red mist and they're getting a wee bit wound up.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Emms and Robertson have absolutely catapulted out the blocks and are winning 10-4. A couple of questionable line calls but Emms' ferocious net play has got the Danes looking a little scared.</p> <p>Unlike their male counterparts, the American basketball girls have managed a hefty win over South Korea, beating them 80-57.</p> <p>\"Any news on whether Paula Radcliffe is actually injured or not?\" asks Keys Avris. Only the denial so far, we'll keep you posted.</p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Woohoo! It looks like the BBC will be treating us to Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson's meeting with Danish mixed doubles badminton pair Rasmussen and Olsen after all, they're just warming up as I type. The Brits have beaten them before, but the first point goes to the Danes.</p> <p>Cycling results as demanded by Matthew Gibson: Nicola Cook finished 19th, just a smidge away from that \"guaranteed\" medal, and has dropped out of the track events, presumably to go and pout somewhere.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> \"Tedious Fact of the Day,\" announces Andrew Goldsby, a sure-fire way to get anyone to open an email. \"Yngling is Norwegian for youngling the original Norwegian designer of the boat designed it for his younglings.\" You can almost hear him drone it, can't you? In Athens, meanwhile, the Beeb are ignoring the badminton mixed doubles and sticking with the archery, so I couldn't say how Emms and Robertson are getting on, but Alison Williamson is doing well in her quarter final so far...</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> \"One of Mike Adamson's last dispatches informed us that the British team is apparently doing well in something called Yngling,\" says Peter Morley, as if I wouldn't have been reading my colleague's coverage. Ahem. \"What the hell is Yngling? Sounds like a Welsh version of fishing to me.\"</p> <p>Sadly I'll have to dismiss that Peter, the international yngling association says it's a \"cross between a planing dinghy and a keelboat.\" There, that's cleared that up. No?</p> <p>I'm contractually obliged to bring you something results related, so how about the women's 25m pistol? I knew you'd be thrilled. Maria Grozdeva of Bulgaria won the gold, Czech Lenka Hykova took silver and Irada Ashumova of Azerbaijan took bronze.</p> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> Despite lying fifth and generally being our best hope of a medal in the prancing around on horseback that is the three-day eventing, William Fox-Pitt has withdrawn due to a slight injury to Tamarillo. All seems a bit precious to me, especially since it means overall Britian will slip from third to fourth, but then I never did understand horsey types. \"Couldn't he just rope in another horse?\" asks Stu Cory, and I'm seconding it.</p> <p>For the general athletics enthusiast, some good news: Haile Gebrselassie says he will race despite a leg injury because the Olympics is such a big event. \"If it was any other race I wouldn't have come. It only comes round once every four years,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> Afternoon. We'll start things off as we mean to go on: a random comedy moment that doesn't technically leave you that much better informed. American swimmer Kara Lynn Joyce, who qualified second for the women's 100m freestyle semi final, reckons she was given a head start by... a bee. Apparently the little critter was buzzing around her feet, hence her reaction time of 0.71s off the blocks. </p> <p>For those who wish to be informed, Swedish duo Jan-Ove Waldner and Jorgen Persson have pulled off a shock! victory over Chinese team Kong Linghui and Wang Hao in the men's doubles table tennis. The Swedes \"were lucky\", according to the Chinamen.</p>",
  "<p>Holidaying in the Italian lakes has its charms, but Como again? In <strong>Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller</strong> (August), William Cook recommended instead heading for Lake Constance - \"one of Europe's best-kept secrets\". </p> <p>Also known as the Bodensee (German for \"earth sea\"), the lake is central Europe's second biggest and forms a border between Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Although \"international traffic has dwindled to a few pleasure boats\", you can still make out \"a rich flotsam of antique ports and palaces\" among the fishing vessels and ferries. </p> <p>Cook marvelled at how Lake Constance could shift from \"quaint and kitsch\" to \"deep and wide and vaguely sinister, like the scene of an unsolved crime\". </p> <p>Undeterred, he dipped a toe into the three countries, beginning with Germany's Friedrichshafen, birthplace of the Zeppelin. Still under the influence of the lake's \"strange magic\", Cook described how the inevitable teenagers drinking in a park \"acquire an air of mystery, like bit-part players in the opening scene of a foreign film\". </p> <p>After a brief visit to Austria, the town of Rorschach tested Cook's assumptions about Switzerland being \"tidy and boring\", proving instead to be \"casual and interesting an intriguing mishmash\". </p> <p>The magazine also featured the snowcap of Mount Kilimanjaro, which is \"melting so rapidly that it could disappear within a decade\". The Tanzanian tourist board is understandably worried, and Hemingway fans should book now to catch a glimpse of the peak described in The Snows of Kilimanjaro, his greatest short story, as \"wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun\". </p> <p>With The Motorcycle Diaries, a film version of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara's eye-opening road trip through impoverished South America, about to open in Britain, <strong>Global</strong> (July/August) followed David Atkinson along the newly opened Che Guevara Trail in Bolivia. </p> <p>\"While its Andean neigh bour Peru is all about coach parties and tour agencies, Bolivia is quieter, calmer and somehow feels more real. Peru has Machu Picchu, the rainforest and the Nazca lines. Bolivia has Tiahuanaco, the Beni and the Che trail. Plus a fraction of the crowds, far, far lower prices and a vaguely charming innocence about tourism.\" </p> <p>The trail begins in Santa Cruz and follows the last days of the revolutionary leader, through \"rustic pueblos \" to La Higuera where he was captured and \"met his untimely end\". </p> <p>The project, after two years of improvements to the tourism infrastructure, \"hopes to convert the hero-worship and iconography of Che into tourist greenbacks.</p> <p>If successful, it will inject much-needed cash into one of Bolivia's poorest rural communities.\" Surely he would have approved. </p> <p>In Australia, Rodney Bolt went on his own journey of the soul for <strong> Wanderlust</strong> (August/September), driving solo from Melbourne to Sydney. </p> <p>For all the delights of the Great Ocean Road - rolling hills, sandy beaches, kangaroos and rainforests - something was lacking. Bolt had a moment of clarity while gazing at the Southern Cross and sipping wine in a Jacuzzi: \"There are times when travelling alone really sucks. If this were a movie, I would have picked up a hitchhiker by now and be heading for reckless adventure or heady romance.\" </p> <p>Stopping for the night in Port Fairy, Bolt lamented that \"if the previous night's Jacuzzi-with-a-view had been romantic, [this hotel] with a riverside veranda smothered in white climbing roses was even more so.\" He \"stomped off to the local pub for a solitary steak and chips\". </p> <p>A few hours in the outback, however, with \"magnificent views of absolutely nothing\", brought a revelation. \"For once, driving alone had a point. I felt completely detached, totally free, unassailable, unstoppable and calm.\" And so ended the loneliness of the long-distance driver.</p>",
  "<p> As a child, Lin Ju lay in bed at his parents' home in the Fujian province of China and dreamt of representing his country in the Olympic Games. Yesterday at the Galatsi Hall, the venue for the table tennis competition, that dream came true almost exactly as he had imagined it. Only the country had changed. </p> <p>Lin, 24, is the Dominican Republic's sole representative in the men's table tennis competition. His compatriot in the women's draw bears the equally un-Hispanic name of Wu Xue, and together the China-born pair carry the hopes of the central American republic, and in particular its president Rafael Hispolito, who was instrumental in ensuring they competed in Athens under the red, white and blue flag of his country. </p> <p>Yesterday Lin produced one of the shocks of the competition so far, progressing to the last 16 with a 4-2 victory over the Belgian Jean-Michel Saive, ranked 16th in the world to Lin's 137th. The result was the talk of the hall with some experts hailing the emergence of a new star, but Lin's win again raised concerns, not least among the sport's governing body, about the prevalence of China-born players competing under alien flags. </p> <p>Players born in China occupy the No1 spots in Luxembourg, Italy, Austria and the US, and there are 14 playing under flags of convenience in Athens. It is a reflection of the huge influence the world's most populous nation wields over the Olympics' most homely event, which will move to the centre of the games in Beijing in four years' time. </p> <p>The reason that so many Chinese seek asylum in the colours of other nations lies in the strength of the competition at home. Five of the top 10 men in the world are Chinese, and six of the top women. With such enormous strength in depth few but the very elite can expect to reach an Olympics. </p> <p>Such is the dominance of the Chinese that the International Table Tennis Federation has amended its qualifying regulations to give the rest of the world a chance. Only three competitors from any country are permitted to play, a rule that has deprived the tournament of six of the world's top 20 women and four of the men. </p> <p>The doubles regulations have also been altered with teams from the same country starting in the same side of the draw so that they cannot meet in the final. The ITTF maintains that the rule applies to all, but its intention is plainly to keep the Chinese apart lest team orders undermine the final. </p> <p>The federation and the International Olympic Committee regulations are designed to prevent a mercenary culture taking hold, demanding that competitors bear a passport from the country they wish to represent, and that they have not competed for another nation for three years. </p> <p>Nevertheless there are cases that cause disquiet, and Lin's is one. Two years ago he left China, frustrated at failing to break into the national team after being employed as a hitting partner for the elite players. </p> <p>From Fujian he travelled to stay with a friend in Spain, where he soon impressed playing in league competitions in and around Cordoba. It was here that he was spotted by the chairman of the Dominican Republic table tennis federation, on the look-out for talent that could be imported to Santa Domingo. </p> <p>Lin accepted the chairman's offer and as he had no international experience the only barrier to participation in Athens was a passport. For that the table tennis authorities turned to President Hispolito. Under the Dominican Republic's constitution it is in the president's gift to award three passports each year, and in 2002 Lin and Wu Xue were the lucky recipients of two of them. </p> <p>Their swift naturalisation caused uproar when they won their respective competitions at the Pan-American games, but there was no breach of ITTF rules and they were free to continue to Athens. </p> <p>Lin rejects the accusation that he is a mercenary, but is frank about why he left China. \"I wanted to compete in an Olympic Games and that would have never happened if I stayed in China,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I still feel more Chinese than Dominican because of my cultural background, but the Dominican people are really nice to me and the other team members are really supportive. I am very happy with my performance.\" </p> <p>The small but noisy knot of supporters from his adopted home plainly had no problem supporting their man as his speed and touch confounded Saive, who in contrast to Lin carried Belgium's flag at the opening ceremony. A checked drop-shot that brought him match point after the pair traded driven forehands from the far reaches of the court demonstrated that while Lin's knowledge of Spanish may be shaky, he is eloquent enough at the table. </p> <p>In the next round, though, he meets Wang Hao, ranked three in China and four in the world. That match should give him a stiff reminder of why he left home in the first place.</p>",
  "Liverpool is looking for the kind of taxi driver who at the flick of a meter can say: \"I had that Tracey Emin and her bed in the back of the cab the other day.\" <p>He or she has to be the kind of cabbie who has heard not just of George Harrison but also Harrison Birtwistle.

Try Accrington way.\") </p> <p>The city launched a competition yesterday to find 10 drivers who can charm visitors by waxing cultural in the run-up to Liverpool's year as European capital of culture in 2008. </p> <p>They will be expected to speak about Liverpool's theatres, galleries, concert halls and the city's artistic heritage: \"There's the Playhouse, where the young Beryl Bainbridge trod the boards and Blood Brothers was first done. </p> <p>That's the Walker art gallery where Paul McCartney used to look at the pre-Raphaelites. Here's Philharmonic Hall. You know that Max Bruch, the feller that wrote that violin concerto? He was principal conductor here.\" </p> <p>Drivers should know about events such as the Liverpool Biennial, a feast of contemporary art which this year features a Malaysian artist with a special interest in Roy Rogers' horse, Trigger. But they will be expected to keep quiet about the city's failure to go ahead with the Fourth Grace, the architect Will Alsop's building planned for the Pier Head. </p> <p>On application forms for the role, drivers are asked searching questions, such as: name two of Liverpool's national museums; and what is the name of the city's new media arts centre? </p> <p>The lucky 10 will have their taxis smothered in \"eye-catching new capital of culture 2008 branding\". </p> <p>Warren Bradley, Liverpool council's executive member for leisure, who did not spare the motoring metaphors, said: \"On the road to 2008, we need to make sure Liverpool moves into top gear as a global destination for culture vultures. </p> <p>\"The first impression visitors have of the city needs to be a good one, and cab drivers are among the people tourists are most likely to meet. If we try to make cabbies more aware of Liverpool's rich cultural heritage, we will really put the city in the driving seat.\"</p>",
  "<p>You are sitting around wondering whether the Royal Mail is finally going to deliver your child the academic future you all crave. You may be at home; you may be on holiday. But anxieties are high because in the back of your mind is the poisonous little message that A-levels matter more than life and death. Versions of this mantra have been handed down for over a generation. It proclaims that those who do well this day will live long, prosper and get a mortgage. Those who don't will remain a credit drain on their families and possibly end up on drugs. </p> <p>Absurd unconscious pressures are one thing. But you cannot open a newspaper now without reading dire warnings of the plummeting value of every type of educational qualification from English tests at 14 to the majority of university degrees. Not only will you read that pupils are less clever than they used to be, but also that the volume of students has so flooded the market that graduate wages have fallen. One-third of those who left college in 2003, for example, have attracted absolutely no wages at all, for they remain unemployed. So even if your child does well in exams, what the hell does it count for? </p> <p>The insidious thought then occurs that A-level \"failure\" may be much harder to bear when, for the 22nd straight year in a row, record numbers of pupils are likely to be awarded multiple A grades in all subjects. Those poor parents of pupils attaining any E grades in 2004, therefore, should certainly be prepared to die of educational shame. But first, consider the wider facts. </p> <p>Fears about falling standards are both real and unreal. Yes, Britain could try harder to teach the three Rs, as they do on the continent, but most of the charges fail to appreciate how the real world has changed. When I did A-level history, for example, students could be docked five marks for every spelling mistake. If that rule were applied today, many pupils would score in the minus bracket. We were also required to regurgitate the shameful career of Britain's previously most corrupt prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, in mind-numbing detail, having already spent three hours doing a maths exam in the morning without the aid of calculators. But to what purpose? We ended up as bad trainee journalists, able to toss off a three-hour essay on anything without critical thought yet pernickety to the point of obsession about orthography. Yes, standards then were higher and so was the price. I worked like a devil for my A grades but didn't go out for 24 months because I was too busy reciting Latin verbs at bedtime. While I think we should still teach handwriting, and even elocution for those who mutter, the education provided today has simply been updated for a technically improved environment. </p> <p>So worry not a scrap about the slurs. We are all in the same futuristic boat. Your child must be educated to deal with a world of team-meetings, not spelling tests; for lateral thinking, not tunnel vision; for independent responsibility and not mindless subscription to authority. Not only that, but modern A-levels allow enormous scope for the expansion in types of job and their entry qualifications and I don't just mean in beach management and golf. The fact remains that most foreign students still believe British A-levels and degrees are worth having; the market, at least, insists they represent good value. </p> <p>So now that's clear, how do you react when the dread results are opened? Well don't be like my dad. When, in 1964, I told him I had got an unfashionable collection of A grades he simply asked: \"Was that good?\" Success at A-level is a cause for rejoicing, a big hug and the transfer of cash. Praise now can boost your child's new adult confidence like nothing else. But what to do if your child achieves rather less well than they would have wished? </p> <p>It is often best to ask questions than volunteer opinions from the obvious: \"How do you feel about it?\" to the practical: \"Would you like to come to the cinema tonight?\" Remember that your child's emotions are separate from yours. They have to learn from this experience, not you, and for a while there will be a period of shock and possibly some degree of mourning. Don't be taken in by exterior jauntiness. Some of the worst depressive symptoms are carefully masked, particularly at this teenage stage. You need to be available as a resource, general back-up, quartermaster and chef. But what you most need to do is to avoid any suggestion of despondency on your part, and here's why. </p> <p>First, if necessary, exams can be retaken under most circumstances. Second, high grades are no longer regarded as the only criterion for college admission. Third, and most importantly, there is good evidence to suggest that exams have never been able to measure those components of character and personality that most strongly determine your future success in life. </p> <p>One simple test of this is to ask yourself what became of the swots from your schooldays. Swanning around in white limousines, are they? No, I agree. Not all of them went on to rule the outside world. Many such people are, in fact, too idiosyncratic to make very successful lives and livings. Second, whatever happened to those likeable form clowns? Are they all destitute? I thought not. Interestingly, the statistics suggest that pupils with high levels of emotional intelligence, good social skills and a well-tuned sense of humour but not blessed with a big academic brain are the ones most likely to do well for themselves in later life. In Emotional Intelligence, author Daniel Goleman summarises the situation: </p> <p>Today, one-third of US employees are knowledge workers in teams. </p> <p>Teams are the nervous systems of organisations. </p> <p>The biggest factor making for team success is not IQ, it is co-operativeness (Princeton's Bell Laboratory's study of engineers). </p> <p>Teams that co-operate best are better at handling a crisis. </p> <p>Academic talent is not the best predictor of success in problem-solving - a bunch of geniuses rarely co-operate well; they are too busy competing with each other. </p> <p>High IQ at school does not determine life success or happiness - at best it contributes about 20%. So don't panic, and don't rush. Not only does your child have plenty of time in which to evolve decision-making about a future career (sorry, they are not off your hands until their mid-20s at least) but if the chosen route avoids time spent at university this may not, after all, ruin their earning power or promotional prospects. </p> <p>In other words, if your child does not do well enough to gain entry into higher education I hope you will not lose too much sleep over it. Nor is every child holding their breath. </p> <p>For example, Alice Bartlett, 18, from Tetbury, Gloucestershire, is as laid-back about getting her A-level results as it is possible to be. She is not even sure which day they come out. It probably helps that she knows exactly what she wants to do next - a college course in technical theatre. She says that although the extra points would be helpful to guarantee her place, the A-level results are probably not going to make any significant difference. </p> <p>Yes, her exams went OK. No, she wasn't super-stressed by them. No, she's not unusual in being relaxed. It was well-known at school who was going to study hard and who would have a life instead. Modern students seem so much more sorted on this front. One of Alice's friends, also 18, even landed a job as an air hostess before she had sat the exams. No A-level angst there, then. Where does Alice see herself in seven to 10 years time? \"Auditioning everywhere I can and probably working in a restaurant.\" Are her parents stressed by her exam results? Not in the least: \"Their difficult moment came when they heard I wanted to become an actress but they are completely supportive today ... \" </p> <p>As families, we need to look very hard at the bill of goods being advertised by Tony Blair in his quest to expand university education. Numbers of tertiary students are projected to rise from 400,000 in 1963 to more than 3m by 2010. Alas, it is very doubtful whether there will be enough graduate jobs for them. </p> <p>The debate is fierce, but both sides have to concede that academy is no longer destiny. Employers appear to be disillusioned with graduate immaturity. The value of a degree in the earnings tables is already falling by 1% a year. Those who go straight from school into work enjoy an income, instead of five-figure debts, for an additional three to seven years. In terms of mere pounds and pence, over a working lifetime, they miss out by less than you might assume. One-third of 2003's graduate crop is unemployed. And contemplate this irony. One of my son's friends actually found himself being interviewed for a banking job by the degree-less boy he used to explain differential calculus to in the fifth form. Just as well, really. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Phillip Hodson is a Fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.

  "<p>Last week's BBC documentary, Nuseries Undercover, in which a reporter filmed ill-treatment of children, rekindled a ferocious debate among parents about childcare. It tapped into parents' deep-seated anxiety about leaving their children for many hours a day in the hands of people they barely know. Many parents, especially those whose children have been in nursery since they were less than a year old, probably found some scenes unwatchable. </p> <p>Child psychiatrist Dr Hamish Cameron says it is high time we re-evaluated our dependence on nursery care: \"The idea that has been put out is that the sooner the mother goes back to work, the better,\" he says. \"But nought to three is an important stage in the development of a child's sense of security and stability. They need personal care, not institutionalised care; they need someone reliable and predictable. If they don't get that, it can be very damaging.\" </p> <p>Why do we put our children, and ourselves, through this? We torment ourselves over leaving our children at nursery, but few of us are prepared to make the necessary financial adjustments to stay at home to look after them full time. This is partly because most nurseries are perfectly nice places for children to play. Parents like the idea that there are several carers on the premises, and that children can learn to play with others. </p> <p>But parents also like the idea that they can be parents and remain whole adult people, and this involves, for many, returning to work. The truth is that full-time childcare is beyond most of us. It is exhausting, emotionally draining, and rarely leaves one with a feeling of pride or achievement. </p> <p>When the debate is rekindled by programmes such as this, one wonders, will there come a moment when the trend tips towards parents staying at home? Part-time solutions are increasingly popular, but it will take time before many employers accept that fathers should be allowed to cut their hours. </p> <p>The latest debate may subside, but the big question hangs in the air: could you, would you, look after your own children? <strong> CL</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sam Bryant, 36, lives with her partner, Andrew, and their 16-month-old daughter, Millie</strong> </p> <p>I went back to work when Millie was 10 months old. I kept putting it off because I couldn't bear to leave her. For the first few weeks I found the separation very traumatic. I went back to work because there was no choice - it was because we needed the money rather than to further my career. The biggest agony was finding someone for Millie who I felt completely comfortable with. I found a nursery that had been recommended and visited it at least three times with Millie before I left her there. </p> <p>I returned to work, and missed Millie dreadfully. I felt I wasn't being a true mum. I asked about going back part time but they didn't want me to do that, so in the end I left and got a job where I can work three days a week. I no longer feel terrible about leaving Millie because she has come on in leaps and bounds since starting nursery and gets so much out of it. They can give her more than I could - for example, we don't have a garden but the nursery does, and at nursery the staff can make things with them all the time, which I couldn't do all day long with her. Financially, if I had had a choice I probably wouldn't have gone back to work, but now I'm glad I did. Because I'm not with Millie all the time I really appreciate the time I have with her, and I enjoy working. </p> <p> <strong> Vicky Hall, 40, lives with her husband, Tim, and their son, Mark, three</strong> </p> <p>I wanted Mark to go to nursery at eight months, when I went back to work, but there wasn't a place. I found a childminder, which I was glad about: he had a nurturing, one-to-one arrangement. The creative scope was limited, but it was all he needed at the time. When he was two, I wanted him to have kids around him and a more structured environment. Mark really benefits from nursery: he is an only child, and he enjoys other adults' attention. </p> <p>There's no way I could look after Mark seven days a week. It's too exhausting. When I'm with him, I give him my all, and there is no space for me. When I go out to work, I'm fulfilling a need that is not fulfilled at home. I need adult time, and adult feedback about who I am. </p> <p>I love looking after Mark, it's the most stimulating thing there is, but if I did it full time, I would not be stimulating part of my brain. That said, if the childcare fell apart tomorrow, I'd give up work. </p> <p> <strong> Joe George, 44, lives with his wife, Carole, and children, Ed, five, and Lucy, three</strong> </p> <p>When our children were born we had a lot of discussions about the best way to look after them. In the end we decided that a nursery would be the best option for the children and would allow us to continue working. After the children had been at nursery for several months, a member of staff spoke out about physical and emotional abuse taking place there. Paintbrushes were being shoved down some of the children's throats and some of the children were physically restrained. We removed the children straight away. It was one of the most traumatic episodes in my life. We did a lot of soul searching and talked about moving closer to the children's grandparents. If you live in a community close to extended family and friends who can help out with childcare and give you some breaks, then it becomes an option not to work. In the end we decided to send the children to another nursery, which we were very happy with because we felt that the social aspects of nursery provided a lot of advantages for the children. </p> <p> <strong> Jenny O'Brien, 40, and her partner, Jim, both work full-time. Their daughter, Tillie, is four</strong> </p> <p>When Tillie was born I knew I would have to go straight back to work full time. We were both self-employed and I couldn't let work drop for a second. Two weeks after the birth I was travelling to meetings, seeing the maternity nurseduring my lunch break to feed the baby. I hadn't bonded with her at that stage, so it wasn't a problem. I was under pressure to earn money and I didn't feel bad about it. I would rather be working in the early days; I'm not that excited about changing nappies. It's when they get older that I think they need more of your time, so you can show them how the world works. </p> <p>We hired a nanny who was great for the first few months, but it began to go wrong after that. She was on the phone all the time, and she wouldn't tell me where she had been with my daughter. It got untenable, and she kept lying to us, so we sacked her. </p> <p>I was so scared and freaked out, I lost faith in nannies. I found a nursery run by a wonderful woman who was there every day, so nothing escaped her notice. It was brilliant. But I was working so hard, I couldn't cope with running the house: I needed a nanny to wash my daughter's clothes and cook her food, to tidy up her bedroom. But I was really happy to know that Tillie was safe. In fact it was so good that after we found another nanny, we kept her at the nursery for two days a week. </p> <p> <strong> Dennis Fallen, 44, lives with his wife, Anne, and 18-month-old daughter, Cara</strong> </p> <p>At the moment I'm working four nights on and four nights off, which enables me to care for Cara while my wife is out at work four days a week. Anne's mother helps out when the we can't cover the childcare. We work to improve our family's quality of life but we have to consider the effects on others: we don't like to ask my mother-in-law to look after Cara too much. </p> <p>I used to live in Scandinavia and there are high-quality, subsidised nurseries there to encourage women to continue with their careers. The rest of Europe is light-years ahead of us with regard to care for the family unit and consideration for the role of work in that. If I had the choice I would rather be at home bringing my daughter up. It's good fun watching her develop. </p> <p>A lot of parents share the view that they would rather be at home with young children if it was financially manageable. It is hard work, but I don't give a hoot about that - as a parent you have to get your priorities right. When families were bigger and communities were closer, it was much easier for sisters and brothers to look after each other's children so that parents got a bit of a time to themselves, but these days it's harder to do that. Society places more emphasis on freedom for parents and there's pressure on us to achieve something all the time. Looking after my daughter takes more out of me than going to work does, but at least caring for her is fulfilling. </p> <p> <strong> Karen Redpath, a television producer, had 10 years' professional experience before her first daughter was born 13 years ago</strong> </p> <p> I took six months' maternity leave, but the idea of giving up work indefinitely was not an attractive option. This was partly because we needed the money, but it was more than simply a practical necessity. I valued myself as a working person and I felt strongly that it was not a problem for women to work. While there were times when it was wonderful to spend all my time at home, it could be tedious and understimulating. I had defined myself by my working life and I didn't want to let that go. I feel I can be a very good parent without being at home all the time. </p> <p>We chose a private nursery, where our daughter was one of 10 children in the baby unit. I didn't realise quite how hard it would be to leave a six-month-old child in a nursery and we wondered whether we were doing the right thing. There was a lot of negative publicity at the time about nurseries, and that shook me, but it was a lovely place and she was being looked after by a wonderful woman who later worked for us as a nanny. I felt it was the right choice and all the evidence was that the environment was stable, secure and loving. </p> <p>Three years on, my partner, who is an author, works from home and collects the children from school. One of the many benefits of my continuing to work is that we've had equal experiences of parenting, which means the children are happy to be with both of us. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some names have been changed.

  "<p>Patients will be able to get prescription medicines over the internet, by mail order in 24-hour supermarkets and in out of town shopping centres after a relaxation of the rules controlling the location of pharmacies.</p> <p>The new rules, announced today by health minister Rosie Winterton, will prepare the ground for more widespread use of the internet to order medicines when electronic prescription services currently being piloted by the NHS are extended across the country.</p> <p>At the moment, the pilot schemes are running with two companies, Allcures and Pharmacy2u, but for most patients this still means putting their NHS prescription in the post so it can be verified by the firm before medicines are dispensed.</p> <p>The package of changes announced today is aimed at making it easier and quicker for new pharmacies offering NHS prescription services to open. But the government has stopped short of the full-scale deregulation to increase competition called for by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in a bid to protect smaller community pharmacists.</p> <p>The local community pharmacists are often the only source of prescription medicines for those living in rural areas or without easy access to transport. The OFT recommendations had provoked fears that many would be driven out of business by pharmacies in supermarkets and shopping centres.</p> <p>The government has laid down rules intended to balance the widening of access to pharmacy with safeguards to protect community pharmacists. They stipulate that internet and mail-order based pharmacies must provide a fully professional service, while supermarket-based pharmacies offering services for more than 100 hours a week must stick to their commitment to open for at least that long.</p> <p>Pharmacies can only be located in shopping centres that are outside town centres and cover more than 15,000 square metres. Pharmacies can be set up as part of new one-stop primary care centres, but only where they serve a \"substantial population\" of 18,000 to 20,000 patients and offer a wide range of services other than those provided by GPs, such as dentistry or optometry.</p> <p>Ms Winterton said: \"These reforms continue to support the government's aim to put the needs of patients first, ensuring that local health services reflect the changing lifestyles and needs of patients. We are maintaining the vital role played by community pharmacies, particularly in poorer and rural areas, many of whom are small businesses.</p> <p>\"We are determined to improve access to, and the choice of, pharmacy services and to encourage innovation and excellence so that community pharmacy is recognised as a key player in the provision of NHS services. These reforms will provide an environment in which community pharmacy services can thrive.\"</p> <p>Simon Williams, policy director at the Patients Association, said the new rules should encourage innovation and greater access to pharmacy care. But he added: \"I hope these proposals will complement and not threaten community pharmacies that have a relationship with their local community.\"</p> <p>Internet pharmacy services could improve access to medicines for people who could not physically get to a pharmacy, Mr Williams said, although he was concerned at the absence of professional advice and support that a community pharmacist could offer.</p> <p>Anne Galbraith, chairwoman of the government's advisory group on reforming pharmacy regulations, said: \"Government has obviously given the proposals and our advice very careful consideration. I am sure community pharmacy and the NHS will welcome that the way forward on control of entry has now been finally determined.\"</p>",
  "<p>As searchers continued the grim task of picking through the wreckage and debris caused by flash-flooding in the village of Boscastle, thoughts inevitably turn to how such natural disasters could be avoided or ameliorated.</p> <p>Compared with the estimated 900 who may have died in last month's flooding in Bangladesh, or the \u00a36bn worth of destruction caused by Hurricane Charley in Florida, the damage in Boscastle and its surroundings was, thankfully, on a far smaller scale.</p> <p>Yet for the Cornish village's residents, Monday's events were no less dramatic, with a powerful 3m high wall of water moving at great speed, washing cars out to sea as if they were toys.</p> <p>With the almost tropical rainfall throughout the country, and the wind-ravaged images of Florida on television, it would be simple to blame climate change for the extreme weather conditions. The honest answer, in this case at least, is that no one can say for certain: Boscastle's flash-flood appears to have had more to do with topography as any other particular cause.</p> <p>Freak storms and floodings have been around longer than climate change, even if the number of extreme rainfall periods has risen in the last 30 years.</p> <p>This flood was what, in a less secular world, could easily have been called an \"act of God\", similar to that which devastated the Devonshire villages of Lynmouth and Lynton in 1952.</p> <p>That does not absolve the Environment Agency for the relatively late warning it gave of a flood in Boscastle.</p> <p>Nor does it mean that the climate change issue can be evaded: in the last five years, storm and flood losses in the UK have totalled \u00a36bn, twice the amount of the previous five years.</p> <p>This year's government report, Future Flooding, forecast annual damages from flooding increasing from \u00a31bn to as much as \u00a321bn later this century, if climate change is not tackled.</p> <p>While the cost of reviving Boscastle will not disconcert the insurance industry, the likely frequency of such events suggests the government should think hard about helping householders protect themselves in the increasingly wet and uncertain weather of the future.</p>",
  "<p>Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds looks set to be the most expensive film ever made. According to industry insiders, the film's production budget could top $120m, beating the record set by James Cameron's elephantine Titanic in 1997. In Cameron's case, the gamble paid off. Titanic went on to earn more than $1bn at the global box office.</p> <p>In the meantime director Spielberg and star Tom Cruise are believed to have cleared their schedules in order to fast track the movie into production. Backed by Paramount, he film is tentatively booked for a US release at Christmas 2005.</p> <p>Based on the novel by HG Wells, The War of the Worlds spins a tale of a cowering humanity menaced by a superior intelligence from outer space. The book was published in 1898 but gained a fresh notoriety four decades later as the basis for an Orson Welles radio broadcast that provoked panic across America. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Filmstew.com reports that Spielberg is facing competition - of a sort - in the form of a rival version of the tale. The release of the Paramount blockbuster could clash with the arrival of the snappily titled Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of War of the Worlds. Composer Wayne is currently in pre-production on a $48m animated feature based on his 1978 album. More worryingly for Spielberg and crew, Wayne is reported to hold major rights to Wells's novel - including merchandising tie-ins - across Europe and the bulk of South America. </p> <p>Yesterday, the composer appeared to be playing it cool. \"These are interesting times for The War of the Worlds,\" he said. \"There is no doubt that its profile in its different forms is going to be spectacular. From what I understand Cruise/Spielberg's production will be set in contemporary times, probably the USA, unlike my musical version, which is set as HG Wells wrote it - in Victorian times.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bryce Dallas Howard (so good they named her thrice) makes a tottering entrance on high heels, power-dressed in designer black and wide-eyed beneath a sculpted auburn bob. The celebrity spotlight seems to dazzle her. She starts violently when the publicist materialises with some bottled water and then hovers indecisively by the doorway at the end of our interview. \"I don't know where I'm supposed to be going,\" she says. \"This is a new experience for me.\" </p> <p>You can see why Howard might feel thrown in at the deep end. Her debut film The Village, directed by M Night Shyamalan, installed her at the head of an A-list cast and sent her straight to the top of the US box office. Next is a starring role as the imperilled heroine of Lars von Trier's Manderlay (she was drafted in as the last-minute replacement for Nicole Kidman). This time last year Howard was about to sign up with a temping agency. Today, at 23, she's one of the industry's most sought-after talents. </p> <p>But there's more to the Bryce Dallas Howard story than meets the eye. The clue is in the surname. Bryce is Dallas because she was conceived there, but she is Howard because her father happens to be Ron Howard, best remembered as freckly Richie Cunningham in Happy Days but now the Oscar-winning director behind A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13, and a mainstay of the studio system. Predictably, this has left her open to charges of nepotism. </p> <p>\"I was reading this stuff on the internet, and they were saying, 'She only got this role because Ron Howard is her father',\" she says. \"And of course there's no connection. But that's the nature of the business; there's so much seething envy. It's like that joke: how many actors does it take to change a light bulb? One to change the light bulb and 700 others to complain that they could have done it better. And I know it's true. I've been one of the 700 more times than I've been the one screwing in the bulb.\" </p> <p>In fact Howard arrived at The Village from a successful apprenticeship on the New York stage. She acted in Moli\u00e8re's Tartuffe and Alan Ayckbourn's House and Garden, and caught Shyamalan's attention with her performance as Rosalind in As You Like It. Added to this is the suspicion that Howard's upbringing was far removed from that of your average Beverly Hills brat. She was raised in a secluded Connecticut homestead where television was off limits and the children (she has three younger siblings) were encouraged to \"read, paint, use our imaginations\". </p> <p>Her father's job rarely crept across the family hearth. To this day Howard insists that she has never watched an episode of Happy Days and claims not to have realised her dad was a celebrity until she moved to Los Angeles. When did she move to Los Angeles? \"Oh,\" she says, \"about a year ago.\" </p> <p>The trouble is that the more Howard talks about her childhood, the more like The Village she makes it sound. Shyamalan's film is a period fairytale about a Utopian community menaced by the monsters in the woods and fearful of the Sodom and Gomorrah townships that lie on the other side. You could say that Howard plays the role of Little Red Riding Hood, except that she's blind and the hood is yellow. Towards the end she defies her father's wishes to embark on a fraught mercy dash through the forest. It's tempting to view the whole thing as a crafty analogy for Howard's own route to stardom. </p> <p>Shyamalan has admitted that he took a gamble on the actor, casting her out of the blue, in a starring role, without an audition. He did so, he says, because he saw her as embodying a kind of embattled \"American purity\" that made her perfect for the role. You can see it in her wide-eyed innocence, her airy good looks (suggestive of calico dresses and Andrew Wyeth paintings), even the \"goofy, awkward\" quality that she tried to hold at bay but which kept sneaking in. \"That came directly from me,\" she exclaims. \"It was Bryce up there on the screen.\" </p> <p>And yet it strikes me that it was these exact same attributes that formed the bedrock of her father's own acting career, in the days before he jacked it in to become a director. Whether it was as callow Cunningham in Happy Days, or playing John Wayne's aw-shucks sidekick in The Shootist, Ron Howard cornered the market in corn-fed Americana. His speciality was the boy-next-door. He was guileless, wholesome and endearingly out-of-place in a world of guns, girls or rock'n'roll. </p> <p>Off-screen, too, Howard appears to have lived an apple-pie existence. Inevitably, it has filtered through to his daughter. \"My parents started dating when they were 16. They got married when they were 21 and they are still together,\" she explains. \"So I've grown up in this very isolated, very controlled, very pure environment. And the things that my parents stand for, which you can see in my dad's work, are very pure and lovely, I think. I don't look at myself and think I'm innocent,\" she laughs. \"But I can see how other people might perceive me as perhaps even naive, because there are certain things that I haven't experienced that exist in the world and that I've chosen to avoid. And I'm trying to deal with that now because I don't want to live in ignorance, because it's very dangerous. And that, in many ways, is what The Village is all about.\" </p> <p>What kind of things has she chosen to avoid? \"Oh, many things. I see danger in many places, and my first inclination is to shelter myself. But I think that you have to experience things, otherwise you're living in a bubble.\" She laughs, a trifle hysterically. \"I don't want to live in a bubble!\" </p> <p>So Howard left home to study at New York University, found work on Broadway, and then moved to Los Angeles \"because I was fearful of Los Angeles,\" she says, \"and I had to find out what I was afraid of\". Presumably it was this same approach that led her to work with Lars von Trier, who famously clashed with Bjork on the set of Dancer in the Dark and has a reputation for driving female actors to breaking point. \"Oh yes, Lars has a very bad reputation,\" she says. \"But he couldn't have been nicer.\" He's a sadist though, isn't he? \"He's not a sadist. He has an eccentric side, but no more than my friends at NYU.\" </p> <p>The problem was that she had enjoyed such a warm relationship with Shyamalan that she was half-hoping that Von Trier would break the spell and shock her into the real world. Annoyingly it didn't happen, and she has yet to meet her wolf in the woods. \"So now I'm in exactly the same position I was after The Village. I don't know what's going to happen next.\" </p> <p>Right now Howard is between jobs, weighing up her next move. She says that her first love is theatre, but she is intrigued by her new direction and keen to see where it leads. Even out of the bubble, there remains something of the cherished, dutiful daughter about her. \"I do want to work in film,\" she says. \"I want to be a part of a film-maker's vision. I think it must have a strange thing to do with my father, and just wanting to make him proud of me.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Village opens on Friday.</p>",

  "The world is heading for wildly uneven population swings in the next 45 years, with many rich countries \"downsizing\" during a period in which almost all developing nations will grow at breakneck speed, according to a comprehensive report by leading US demographers released yesterday. <p>They predict that at least an extra 1,000 million will be living in the world's poorest African countries by 2050. There will be an extra 120 million more Americans, and India will leapfrog China to become the world's most populous country. One in six people in western Europe will be over the age of 65 by 2050. </p> <p>But the populations of some countries will shrink. Based on a number of factors, including analysis of birth and death rates, Bulgaria is expected to lose almost 40 per cent of its population. </p> <p>Britain is expected to grow faster than any other major European country. Within 20 years, the authors expect it to have four million more people, at which point its growth is expected to tail off, adding only a further 1.5 million in the next 25 years to eventually reach 65 million. By then it will have overtaken France as Europe's second or third largest country, depending whether Russia is classed to be in Europe or partly in Asia.</p> <p>The changes, considered inevitable given present trends, will transform geo-politics and fundamentally affect the world's economies, people's lifestyles and global resources, suggest demographers with the Washington-based Population Reference Bureau. </p> <p>Countries such as Nigeria and Japan, which today have similar sized populations of about 130 million people, could be unrecognisable by 2050, say the authors. By then, Nigeria is expected to have more than doubled its numbers to more than 300 million people. But Japan, which has only 14% of its current population under 15, may have shrunk to roughly 100 million people. </p> <p>Among the major industrialised nations, only the US will experience what the authors call \"significant\" growth. It is expected to have reached a population of 420 million by 2050, an increase of 43%. But Europe is expected to have 60 million fewer people than today and some countries could lose more than a third of their populations. </p> <p>Eastern Europe is leading the world's down shifters. Bulgaria is expected to return to pre-1914 population levels, losing 38% of its people, while Romania could have 27% fewer and Russia 25 million fewer people. Germany and Italy are expected to shrink by about 10%. </p> <p>The projections are based on detailed analysis of infant mortality rates, age structure, population growth, life expectancy, incomes, and fertility rates. They also take into account the numbers of women using contraception and Aids/HIV rates, but do not allow for environmental factors. </p> <p>Climate change and ongoing land degradation are widely expected to encourage further widespread movements of people and pressure for migration away from rural areas towards cities and richer countries. </p> <p>The population changes are causing growing alarm among experts, who believe sustained growth in developing countries can only be managed with economic help from rich countries. \"World population is going to grow massively in some of the most vulnerable countries in the world. We have to ask how rich countries are going to help\", said Kirstyen Sherk, of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. </p> <p>The former World Bank economist Herman Daly believes globalisation and the uncontrolled migration of cheap labour could put potentially catastrophic pressures on local communities and national economies. \"The sheer number of people on Earth is now much larger than ever before in history. Some experts question whether Earth can even carry today's population at a 'moderately comfortable' standard for the long term, let alone 3 billion more\". </p> <p>The report, based on countries' own statistics, confirms trends identified earlier by the UN, and more recently by the US Population census report. While the world's few developed countries are expected to grow about 4% to over 1.2 billion, population in developing countries could surge by 55% to more than 8 billion. </p> <p>Africa and Asia will inevitably be transformed. Western Asian nations are expected to gain about 186 million people by 2050 and sub-Saharan African countries more than one billion people. By 2050, India will be the largest country in the world, having long passed China. </p> <p>How some countries will cope with the changes is debatable. Bangladesh, one of the poorest, most crowded and disaster-prone countries, may have doubled numbers to more than 280 million. </p> <p>Overall, says the report, world population is growing by about 70 million people a year, and will likely reach 9.3 billion by mid-century from 6.3 billion today. </p> <p>However, a separate report, to be published soon by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, will argue that fertility rates in poor countries could drop if there is a world fuel crisis. The thinktank says people usually have as many children as they think they can afford, and the motivation to have fewer comes from anticipating hard times ahead. </p> <p>Increases in food production per hectare, it will say, have not kept pace with increases in population, and the planet has virtually no more arable land or fresh water to spare. As a result, per-capita cropland has shrunk by more than half since 1960, and per capita production of grains, the basic food, has been falling worldwide for 20 years. </p> <p><b>Losers in a numbers game</b></p> <p>Five countries are likely to lose a substantial proportion of their population by 2050. These are: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Bulgaria -38% (7.8 to 4.8 million) </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Moldova -28% (4.2 to 3 million) </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Romania -27% (21.7 to 15.7 million) </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Russia -17% (144 to 119 million) </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Latvia -24% (2.3 to 1.8 million) </p> <p>A dozen countries are forecast to more than double in numbers. They are all politically, socially or environmentally volatile.</p> <p>Yemen (255%) Palestine (211%) Afghanistan (187%) and Kuwait (182%) have all been involved in armed conflicts. Bhutan (113%) and Nepal (105%) are undergoing great changes.</p> <p>Kiribati (133%), the Solomon islands (112%) Tuvalu (122%) and Vanuatu (124%) are all expected to be devastated by climate change and rising sea levels.</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturing's recovery is being hit by rising prices in commodities ranging from oil to steel scrap. Crude prices set new record levels yesterday, pushing up energy prices, while the price of many steel products is at least 50% higher than a year ago - and could rise further. </p> <p>Yesterday Brian Cooke, the chief executive of West Midlands-based company Castings, described the situation as the worst in 40 years. \"I have not seen such rapid increases in costs in 40-odd years in the industry. This is something new and outside our control.\"</p> <p>Martin Temple, the director-general of the EEF, which represents many of the UK's manufacturing firms, said that with commodity prices from scrap to energy rising, \"it is inevitable that there are some massive price pressures\".</p> <p>Latest official figures show that manufacturing input prices rose by 3.4% in the year to July, while output prices were up 2.5%, implying that companies were seeing margins under pressure.</p> <p>The price squeeze could intensify. Ian Rodgers, the director of trade organisation UK Steel, said that while prices had reached a plateau during the summer, \"it looks as if prices will start to pick up again in the post-holiday period\".</p> <p>Surging steel production in China has been the key factor, sending the price of raw materials for making steel, such as iron ore, scrap and coke, soaring.</p> <p>Mr Rodgers believes China remains the \"joker in the pack\" in respect of global demand for raw materials and steel.</p> <p>\"There is still a very tight supply situation as far as the world steel market is concerned,\" he said.</p> <p>Although power shortages over the summer had slowed Chinese steel production, \"the market for steel has started growing again\".</p> <p>Oil prices are at all-time highs in nominal terms, despite falls earlier in the week on the back of the Venezuelan referendum result, which eased fears of possible disruption of supplies from the world's fifth largest producer.</p> <p>The latest rise came yesterday as US consumer price figures suggested demand would remain strong. In New York oil settled at $46.72 a barrel after peaking at a new high of $46.95.</p> <p>The future of energy prices is a growing concern within UK manufacturing - and not simply because of the current oil price. Mr Temple cites issues such as emission trading, climate change laws and the price of gas as additional factors likely to affect the price of electricity, energy's bottom line for manufacturers, over the coming months.</p> <p>\"It is a big issue now what the [electricity] price is going to be by the end of the year or this time next year.\"</p> <p>The one upside for industry is evidence that some manufacturers appear able to pass on price increases.</p> <p>In sectors such as the automotive industry, where long-term contracts have been awarded on the basis of annual price reductions, Mr Temple says there is anecdotal evidence that cost increases are being passed on. \"For the first time, people are now seeing prices are having to go up.\"</p> <p>Mr Cooke argues that for companies supplying products for which the main component is steel, higher prices are essential. \"If industries don't pass on the price increases, they won't be there.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Google awaits float approval</strong><br> </p> <p>The Google IPO is facing another slight delay as the company awaits final approval of its paperwork by the US securities and exchange commission. The company hoped to win approval last night, but the offering is now expected to be priced today, assuming the SEC gives final approval. The regulator gave no reason for the delay. </p> <p><strong> Buy-to-let turns soft</strong><br> </p> <p>Growth in the buy-to-let property market slowed during the first half of 2004 as investment landlords responded to higher interest rates, figures showed today. In the first six months of the year, landlords took out 119,800 mortgages worth \u00a312bn to buy property to rent out, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. But while the number of loans advanced was 6% higher than in the previous six months and the value was 3% higher, the growth rate was down on the 50% rise in the second half of 2003. </p> <p><strong> Yukos raises cash for tax bill</strong><br> </p> <p>Yukos raised $357m (\u00a3195m) towards a $3.4bn tax claim yesterday by selling a stake in its gas venture Rospan to partner TNK-BP. </p> <p>Yukos is pulling together every penny to pay down the tax bill and Rospan is the first non-core asset it has sold. Yukos is banned from selling assets but Rospan was owned by a subsidiary. It is looking for ways to raise money on sales of non-core assets to prevent bailiffs selling its core oil units.</p> <p><strong> Air Canada and creditors agree</strong><br> </p> <p>Air Canada creditors approved a recapitalisation that will allow the world's 11th largest airline to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a clean balance sheet. Unsecured creditors owed C$7.5bn (\u00a33.1bn) voted by 99.6% in favour of the plan. </p> <p><strong> Coca-Cola loses president</strong><br> </p> <p>Steven Heyer, Coca-Cola's president and chief operating officer, who missed out on the top job in May, will depart on September 1. </p> <p>Mr Heyer has held talks with White Plains, New York-based Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide about becoming chief executive but no agreement has been reached, the Wall Street Journal reported. </p> <p>Starwood has narrowed its list to a small group of candidates, said Joe Greff, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. \"I would think someone from Coke certainly fits the bill of having a reasonably strong branding background.\" </p> <p><strong> Cantor spins off voice arm</strong><br> </p> <p>Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond broker that suffered more deaths in the September 11 attacks than any other company, said yesterday it would spin off its global voice brokerage business, and focus on expanding its institutional equity and fixed-income businesses. </p> <p>The new company, BGC Partners, will initially employ more than 400 brokers in London, New York, Geneva, Hong Kong, Milan and Tokyo. Lee Amaitis, who has served as president and chief executive of Cantor's European and Asian operations, will be BGC's chairman and chief executive.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Energy savers </strong> <br> Julie Kirkbride, the Conservative party's shadow culture, media and sport minister, was outraged last week, claiming that there was no cash to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar next year, but that \u00a35m of heritage lottery money had been \"wasted\" on an an energy advice centre in Cornwall, which is closing down because of \"a lack of interest\". This is twaddle. The Delabole Gaia energy centre says it didn't receive a penny of lottery money and next to nothing from the government. Most of the cash, indeed, came from Europe, local businesses, and the founders. Nor was it a failure. It attracted 50,000 people a year to one of Cornwall's poorest areas, including visitors from hundreds of schools. But more money was needed and the centre was put in the hands of the receiver. He, bizarrely, sold it to a property speculator for \u00a3500,000, which is less than was offered by a local philanthropist, who wanted to keep it going as an energy centre. To really rub it in, the centre is now on the market for \u00a31.2m. That's the real scandal.</p> <p><strong> Up and atom </strong> <br> Ms Kirkbride may not think that educating people about energy is important, but Eco Sounding understands that her leader, Michael Howard, is about to make it party policy to reintroduce nuclear power. Perhaps Ms Kirkbride will be able to tell him if subsidising the industry by \u00a32m a day forever is also to be considered a waste of money.</p> <p><strong> Disaster waiting to happen </strong> <br> August 13 has been and gone. Any bells ringing, Mrs Beckett? Yes, that was the date Defra should have published details about how Britain is going to respond to the European electronic waste directive, (Weee) which will revolutionise how we dispose of all electrical and electronic waste. But as British business and local authorities are nowhere ready to comply, and even senior Defra officials are aware that it's going to be a disaster, perhaps it's wise to go on hols.</p> <p><strong> All hope is lost </strong> <br> If the European Commission really wanted to signal that it didn't give a monkey's about the environment then it would probably choose as its new environment commissioner an old, rightwing free-marketeer lawyer who used to work for the World Bank and had responsibility for Africa in the bad old 1970s. Impossible? Not in the slightest. Welcome Stavros Dimas, 62, Greek economist, Wall Street banker and conservative lawyer. The fragile hopes of Europe's mountains, rivers, climate and forests rest on you.</p>",
  "<p>In the coming years, the gap year may well come to be seen as the last flickerings of a golden age when gilded youths flopped languidly on Goan beaches swapping bon mots in front of the sinking sun. For while the traditional gap year is still a popular option, the financial pressures on those taking one are growing. Student debt is growing year on year as it is, but worse may yet be to come. </p> <p>Students entering university this year and next year, and even those taking deferred entry in 2005, will feel relatively safe - but those joining up in 2006 will be the first to be hit with the new tuition fees of (more than likely) \u00a33,000 a year. Many are predicting that student debts will rocket.</p> <p>So what is there to do, other than think long and hard - and then take the gap year anyway. When else are you going to have the freedom that you have right now? Feel the debt, and do it anyway, as they (nearly) say. There are very few times in your life when you can laze around abroad and maintain a socially acceptable CV. Career breaks may be possible in theory; in practice, the numbers who get around to jacking in work to go travelling later in life are pretty low. While money may well be tight, and tighter in the future, most school-leavers will have fewer ties now than in the family/mortgage/career-burdened future. And having a place secured at university pre-empts the worst angst of all travellers: what to do when you get home.</p> <p>Not that travel is the only option. There are increasing moves to encourage students to take up volunteer work, including rumours of a scheme by the Labour government to partially write off debts in return for signing up to accredited projects in the voluntary sector. Whether or not that comes off, volunteer work is gaining popularity, partly through financial constraints (it will still cost you something to do community work, but not as much as sitting on your backside on an Aussie beach).</p> <p>Whatever you decide to do, you'll need to address the question before sending in your Ucas application, so, for some of you, the advice may be too late. But for those heading for Clearing, this may well be a golden opportunity to apply for a place in a year's time, rather than in a few weeks hence. </p> <p>If you apply for delayed entry, they won't think any the worse of you, although admissions tutors may ask what you plan to gain from the time off, so make sure you have an answer ready. Let's not pretend jetting around the world will make you a better person: it won't. Whether admissions tutors genuinely think that travel broadens the mind is debatable; perhaps they simply hope that next year's freshers will get the worst excesses of drug-taking and sexual abandon out of the way on some foreign beach rather than on campus. Either way, such concerns shouldn't cloud your horizon.</p> <p>Once you have decided to make that break, and if you have decided to travel, then just take a word of warning. If you do decide to take a gap longer than nine months before you start your course, you should make sure you have as much proof as possible of your intended return to study. This might include evidence of having secured deferred entry to your chosen institution and/or tickets with a specific date of return, if you're taking the travelling route. In the past, some local education authorities have not accepted that a period abroad of longer than nine months is a temporary absence and have, therefore, disqualified some students from tuition fee support and student loans on the grounds they do not fulfill the residency requirement for such support. This can be challenged, but the more proof you can supply that your absence will be temporary, the more likely it is to succeed. Contact your local National Union of Students' welfare unit for more details if you think this might be a problem for you.</p> <p>Once you've decided to take the plunge, the big question - how to fund your year - is the first to solve. The old-fashioned route (admittedly when gap years were rare) is to take advantage of a rent-free parental environment and get your head down for a long slog of paid work to gather the pennies. But if staying a few more months at home seems a heavy price to pay for the time ahead, you should be encouraged by the deals and financial cushions open to students and the under-26s.</p> <p>Raising money and making the cash go further might prove easier under the aegis of charitable organisations. Raleigh International and Project Trust are perhaps the best known of the many groups that look for volunteers to work overseas on conservation or charity projects (thus also neatly solving the volunteer/travel conundrum). Typically, you raise an initial sum and then work for three months with all accommodation and subsistence provided, but your travel tickets will allow you to stay abroad and do your own thing for much longer. The structure and support the charities offer, and the environmental and community projects they run, mean you're likely to get something more tangible than a suntan from your trip. And raising sponsorship could be both quicker and more enjoyable than saving for months in a menial job.</p> <p>If you don't want to commit to a long-term project abroad, travelling and working as you go is a possibility. Making your way to Australia for a working stop on a round-the-world trip is the classic option, attractive not least for sunshine in January. Again, it's easier when you're young as the temporary work visas are only normally issued to people under 30. And the exchange rate is still pretty favourable to Brits heading that way. Either way, you need \u00a32,000 and an onward airline ticket to get a visa for Australia.</p> <p>Remember, too, that working abroad can sound a lot more glamorous than it is. Sorting out the bureaucracy through an organisation like BUNAC might help you get a job in the US, but there are a lot of unhappy au pairs out there. And holiday firms offering courier or chalet jobs are likely to pay you an absolute pittance, although they can be a lot of fun. Try, if possible, to speak to your predecessors or current incumbents in any such job to work out just what the costs and rewards might amount to. Resorts have their own economy, and things like customer tips or free beer at a bar can make or break you on holiday rep wages.</p> <p>There's no obligation to make hard and fast plans, but you should be wary of falling into the trap of planning to save and travel and somehow never making it out of that stop-gap job. Having said that, once exams, teachers and careers advisors are a distant memory, it can sometimes be easier to work out for yourself just what you fancy doing and where you want to go. </p> <p>The harsh facts of life are that pre-university, a year without obligation feels like freedom and opportunity; post-graduation, it's called unemployment. If you have the chance of travelling now, go for it. And turning up at college with a bit more experience under your belt than a few A-levels will make you an irresistible source of fascination to greener, doe-eyed contemporaries. Well, maybe.</p>",
  "<p>When we think of women swinging on bars, somersaulting on beams, tumbling on carpets and soaring over vaults at the Olympic Games, we do not necessarily think of Pamela Anderson. </p> <p>We remember the grace, beauty, impudence and sheer blinding bodily flexibility of Lyudmila Tourischeva, Nelli Kim, Olga Korbut, Nadia Comaneci and Svetlana Boginskaya. When we think of Anderson, we think of other forms of beauty and flexibility, of which, come to think of it, tumbling on carpets and swinging in, rather than on, bars may sometimes be a part. But the one-time star of Baywatch was an unseen presence in Athens last night as the United States attempted to win the team award with the aid of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Mohini Bhardwaj, a 4ft 10in 25-year-old from Philadelphia. </p> <p>They failed, giving best to a brilliant Romania squad who repeated their victory of four years ago. But, although in the end the competition lacked suspense, it did not lack excitement, thanks to a large and enthusiastic crowd in an arena that had been less than half-full for the previous nights of gymnastic competition. </p> <p>Anderson, a gymnast herself until the age of 10, became involved in Bhardwaj's career with a $20,000 (\u00a311,000) donation and has since set up a fund to assist her progress. She got her reward when Bhardwaj, who has a Russian mother and an Indian father, made an immediate impression last night. After her team-mate Carly Patterson had muffed her landing in the lead-off vault, she earned the first 9.5 score for a squad so rich in talent that their team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi was able to leave three current world champions on the sidelines. </p> <p>The rules have changed since the last Olympics and the women's team event now involves three gymnasts from each team performing each of the four exercises, with the results decided on a points aggregate. All scores count, none is dropped and a single fall in the course of 2 hours can make a great deal of difference to the result. </p> <p>Introduced to the Olympics in 1928, the team event was long dominated by the Soviet Union, which won 10 out of 11 gold medals between 1952 and 1992, missing out only in 1984, when its government boycotted the games in Los Angeles, allowing Romania to take the victory. By the time the US won in Atlanta in 1996 the Soviet Union had disappeared. </p> <p>Romania and Russia finished first and second in Sydney, with China edging out the US for the bronze medal. And it was Romania and Russia who presented the greatest threat to the US team last night, Monica Rosu's 9.6 in the vault carrying Comaneci's heirs into the lead after the first rotation. </p> <p>Nothing, however, could prevent Svetlana Khorkina slipping into her usual role of the diva of the competition. With gold medals on the asymmetrical bars from Atlanta and Sydney behind her, and two silver medals in the team event, the Russian star made her first appearance in the vault and was lucky to be awarded a 9.375 after a terrible landing. For Khorkina, whose resting expression is that of a Harvey Nicholls sales assistant asked if she has any sensible shoes in stock, but who smiles for the cameras readily enough, Athens is probably a swan song. </p> <p>At the age of 25 she is thin enough to engender a degree of worry among her admirers. But she took part in each of the four disciplines last night, hearing the crowd chant her name as she surfed over the lower of the uneven bars to initiate a routine full of power and panache, concluded with an unsteady touchdown. </p> <p>On the balance beam she was good enough for the crowd to boo the judges when they awarded her only 9.437 and they even booed again when she was given 9.600 for the floor exercise, although that seemed a mildly excessive reward for a sequence of fantastic springs and leaps interspersed with a few shopworn Bolshoi routines. </p> <p>If Korkhina goes into retirement after this week's individual competitions, there is no obvious heir to the line of gymnastic queens going back to Tourischeva and beyond. No doubt someone will emerge, probably from Romania, for whom the comparatively womanly Catalina Ponor, who turns 17 on Friday, finished off the competition last night with a floor routine of enormous zest and elegance after her team-mates Nicoleta Sofronie and Oana Ban, a pair of tiny twisters, had buried US hopes with exercises full of startling changes of direction. </p> <p>The US team had lost their last hopes a few minutes earlier, when Courtney Kupets began her floor exercise with elan but suffered a terrible stutter of her feet midway through. Bhardwaj similarly endured a momentary loss of direction and Patterson could not revive the team's effort with a phenomenal routine that included one remarkable stop from full speed at the very perimeter of the exercise area, coming to a halt on tip-toe, facing outwards. </p> <p>Of the rest the comparatively tall Ukrainian gymnasts did ice-maiden impersonations in their pristine white costumes and the hard-trying Australians resembled little leprechauns in their twinkly emerald green leotards. The Chinese and the French both suffered from a spate of falls. </p> <p>And so Karyoli failed to repeat the triumph masterminded by her husband Bela, the controversial Romanian who coached Comaneci to her seven perfect 10s in 1976, guided Mary Lou Retton to a gold medal in the combined event eight years later and sent the half-crippled Kerri Strug out to produce the final agonised vault that sealed the women's team gold for the US in Atlanta. </p> <p>That was a marvellous story and, coming on the heels of Retton's individual triumph, it cemented the popularity of women's gymnastics in the US. Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes, Strug and their team-mates became as famous as pop stars. Last night, despite Pamela Anderson's assistance, their successors failed to match that feat.</p>",
  "<p>Martin Kettle states that \"people who believed what Tressell believed spent much of the 20th century murdering millions of people\" (For a lesson in humanity, turn to Thoreau not Tressell, August 17). </p> <p>So now we know why Hitler killed 6 million Jews - it was all due to The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. And postwar US foreign policy in Vietnam wasn't really about fighting communism but promoting it. </p> <p>Wait a minute, perhaps he had in mind Stalin. Yes, history would have been very different if only Uncle Joe hadn't leafed through Tressell's template for mass extermination. </p> <p>Yes, wherever you see bodies in 20th-century history, you see the hand of Robert Tressell. </p> <p>His account of poverty, of the crushing of the creative spirit, of the misery of unemployment, of the indifference and narrow-mindedness of religion, of people being fobbed off with the blandishments of popular culture is a handbook for tyrants. </p> <p>Thank goodness we don't find New Labour MPs referring to this poisonous work. Without low pay, long working hours and constant surveillance we would all either be very miserable or dead.<br> <strong>Dr Gary Day</strong><br> Author of the introduction to the Harper Collins edition of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists </p> <p>Kettle ignores the fact that The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists was written years before the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia, and that from Karl Kautsky at that time to the east European solidarity campaign in the 1980s, many of the most trenchant critics of the ghastly regimes Kettle presumably has in mind were socialists.<br> <strong>Ian Bullock</strong><br> Brighton </p> <p>The reason so many people find The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists such an inspirational book is precisely because of the reality of Tressell's experience of working with other people. Not only the experience of being the only socialist/trade unionist in a hostile environment but the conversations, humour, banter and sniping that occurs at all levels of society. Something you don't get sitting by a pond.<br> <strong>Trevor Hopper</strong><br> Lewes, E Sussex </p> <p>Martin Kettle writes: \"I do not think that anyone has ever murdered a single person in the name of the worldview that Thoreau expounded.\" Perhaps he's forgotten Ted Kaczynski, America's \"Unabomber\", whose environmentalist, anti-technological attitudes were strongly influenced by Thoreau.<br> <strong>George Simmers</strong><br> Brackley, Northants </p> <p>Some years ago, in Dar es Salaam, I taught The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists as part of a course devised by Martin Kettle's father, Arnold. </p> <p>Students loved this text more than any other because they could connect the characters with their own demons and heroes. It was a source of practical enlightenment. I don't think Thoreau would have done as well for them.<br> <strong>Stanley Mitchell</strong><br> London </p> <p>Martin Kettle's opinions display a startling, if not bourgeois, naivety. That Thoreau - educated at Concord and Harvard - was able to take two years out of his life and build a cabin by a lake suggests a grounding in wealth not available to the painters and decorators in Tressell's novel. </p> <p>With a world population in excess of 6 billion, the solutions advanced by Thoreau, and backed by Kettle, are simply not possible. For survival of the human race, a return to a form of socialism is an absolute necessity.<br> <strong>Rod White</strong><br> Uley, Glos<br></p>"
