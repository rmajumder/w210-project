  "<p>There were flowers at Ben Gurion airport to greet the Newcastle United party on Tuesday night, along with stickers proclaiming \"Israel Loves You\". </p> <p>Given that between them Newcastle and Bnei Sachnin rattled up seven yellow cards and two reds in the first leg at St James' Park, Graeme Souness and his players were entitled to perceive some irony as they boarded their bus. </p> <p>On the half-hour journey from the airport to the sandy beaches of Tel Aviv, a tour guide then used the term oxymoron and said of the political situation in Israel: \"It's war, but it's a small war.\" </p> <p>Newcastle were meant to be reassured by that. They are also meant to be cocooned from the bellicose environment of the Israeli-Palestinian war - a cocoon Souness wants his team to stay in during tonight's match - but the violent society is all around and there is an extension of that in Sachnin's robust style of play, which is even criticised within Israel. </p> <p>Just as it is impossible to ignore that a few hundred yards from Newcastle's hotel is a bar called Mike's Place, scene of the only British-born suicide bomber in the present strife, Souness, despite trying, could not find a description of Sachnin's tactics other than \"argy-bargy\". </p> <p>United's left-back Olivier Bernard added that \"the ambience is not good\" and that there is \"a lot of bad feeling\" from the first leg, one reason Craig Bellamy is likely to sit out the game. </p> <p>\"We are going to play our normal physical football,\" said the Sachnin manager Eyal Lachman yesterday. \"In Israel it is sometimes perceived as over-violent but I don't understand why. Other teams come across from Europe and deploy the same tactics but we are called too aggressive.\" </p> <p>Protecting their 2-0 lead will require patience by United. \"We mustn't get caught up [in a battle],\" Souness said. \"They will try and prevent the game being free-flowing, they will try and break it up. It's up to us to make sure - along with the referee - that it is a football match.\" </p> <p>By yesterday morning it was reported that only 4,000 tickets had been sold for the game in the Ramat Gan Stadium. Sachnin is a two-hour drive away and there are obvious security issues regarding the movement of large numbers within Israel, especially as Sachnin is an Arab-Israeli club. </p> <p>Another factor is the heat. Israel is experiencing a heatwave and in the south it is forecast to be 44C today. In their last qualifying tie to get to this stage, against Partisan Tirana, Sachnin's match was stopped after 30 minutes for a drinks break. Souness said \"the heat is not an issue\" last night after stepping on to the pitch. The surface was \"like Wembley\".</p>",
  "Thailand yesterday announced the first probable case of human-to-human bird flu transmission but insisted it had occurred in unique circumstances and there was no need for the public to panic. <p>The much-feared development in the outbreak, which has been ravaging poultry in east Asia for 10 months and has killed at least 28 people, came a day after both the UN's food and agriculture organisation and the World Organisation for Animal Health warned bird flu in Asia had become \"a crisis of global importance\". </p> <p>Charal Trinwuthipong of Thailand's disease control department said Pranee Thongchan, 26, had died of the deadly H5N1 virus but had not come into contact with infected chickens. She had, however, had \"very close and face-to-face exposure\" to her 11-year-old daughter Sakuntala, who is thought to have contracted the illness while playing with chickens at her house. Sakuntala was cremated before the final tests confirming her cause of death were conducted. </p> <p>Dr Kumara Rai, the head of the World Health Organisation in Thailand, played down the risk of an epidemic spreading through humans. He said the transmission had only occurred after \"very close, direct, face-to-face and long contact\". He added: \"It doesn't pose a significant public health threat, so there is no reason to be panicked.\" </p> <p>He stressed there was no evidence the virus had mutated to mix with the human influenza virus to form a strain that would be much more contagious to humans.</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices set another record yesterday, pushing into uncharted territory above $50 a barrel as tension in Nigeria threatened to push petrol prices above the levels that caused fuel protests in 2000. </p> <p>US light crude futures rose to $50.47 a barrel in overnight trading, the highest price yet although allowing for inflation it is well below levels seen in the late 70s after the Iranian revolution. It later traded back down at $49.90, having failed to consolidate above the $50 mark. </p> <p>North Sea Brent futures also set a record of $46.80 before settling down to $46.60, up 67 cents on the day. </p> <p>A spokesman for the AA said unleaded petrol prices were rising above 82p a litre on average but added that it was common to see forecourts with prices topping 85p - the level that sparked the fuel blockades four years ago. \"There will probably be another penny on the price in the next day or two, so people should shop around. The supermarkets will probably hold back a bit,\" he said. </p> <p>Prices at 1,200 BP petrol stations have gone up from 75p a litre in the summer of 2003 to more than 83p. The company refused to say whether further rises were planned. </p> <p>\"We can't comment on increases or potential increases but we monitor the price of crude on a daily basis,\" a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Oil prices have risen more than 50% this year as surging demand from China, India and the United States has outstripped supply, in spite of production increases from the oil cartel Opec. Demand and supply are at their highest levels for a quarter of a century and the market is vulnerable to any disruption in output. </p> <p>Prices receded late last month but have jumped again in the past few weeks after Hurricane Ivan disrupted supplies from the Gulf of Mexico and fresh fighting erupted between Nigerian government forces and rebels in the oil-producing south. The Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force warned yesterday that foreign oil workers in the southern delta should leave the region ahead of a \"full-scale armed struggle\" beginning on October 1. </p> <p>That was enough to push oil prices to their new record. Nigeria pumps between 2.25m and 2.5m barrels per day (bpd) of world production that amounts to about 81m bpd, so any closure in its oilfields could result in a severe shortage. </p> <p>The Nigerian government said yesterday that the rebels were not powerful enough to launch an all-out offensive and the Italian oil company Eni said it would not be pulling out any of its workers. </p> <p>Analysts remain concerned, however. Simon Wardell, of the World Markets Research Centre, said: \"Once again the security situation in Nigeria is proving to be a real concern. </p> <p>\"The conflict will not fade and the best that can be hoped for is the effective use of federal Nigerian soldiers. </p> <p>\"Oil companies have already sought to shift operations from onshore to offshore in an effort to reduce risks, but there remains a real possibility of significant shut-ins if the [rebel group] lives up to its threats.\" </p> <p>Oil markets have been jumpy about production from the Middle East, particularly Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and from Russia, where the oil company Yukos is locked in a fight with the government over unpaid taxes. </p> <p>Mr Wardell thinks that, while prices may not stay above $50 a barrel for long, winter demand for heating oil means they are unlikely to drop for several months. </p> <p>The CBI said oil prices were a growing threat to firms' prof its. Digby Jones, the director general, said: \"We don't expect a dramatic reaction to this latest rise but it will eat into company profits and world growth will be restrained. It makes it all the more important that government does nothing to add to business costs.\" </p> <p>In China, other commodity prices jumped this year on buoyant global demand. Gold, showing the effect of the rise in oil prices, hit a five-week high of $411.35 an ounce yesterday while platinum reached a six-week high of $874.</p>",
  "<p>Former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland today launched a sweeping attack on the developments in television, criticising the BBC for proposing to sell its commercial businesses and savaging Channel 4 for failing to be the \"creative powerhouse\" of UK broadcasting.</p> <p>He also called for limits on the amount of advertising carried by commercial broadcasters to be lifted and said regulators should abandon any attempts to proscribe programme content. </p> <p>Sir Christopher, who has hardly commented on TV since he left the BBC three years ago, called the mooted sale of BBC Worldwide \"bizarre\", saying it would weaken the corporation as a global brand and reduce the money made available for co-productions. </p> <p>\"Anybody who is anybody should realise that the funds released from the sale of Worldwide would be instantly trousered by the chancellor of the exchequer. The only point of selling Worldwide would be to cheer up the Treasury. In my view, that's best left up to the Treasury. </p> <p>\"International programme distribution cannot be separated from BBC production. In my view, there is no other broadcaster in the world that does this.\"</p> <p>And he was withering about Channel 4, whose biggest rated programmes are series such as Wife Swap and Location, Location, Location and where producers complain that non-consumer programmes are being pushed to the edges of the schedule.</p> <p>\"Channel 4 needs to take a hard look at itself. I am disappointed it is still not the creative powerhouse it could be. From time to time they have made a contribution to UK creativity but, given their position, this is not enough,\" said Sir Christopher.</p> <p>He also criticised plans to privatise Channel 4, saying it would go only one way - turning the channel into another ITV. </p> <p>\"Privatising Channel 4 is likely to be the wrong route, even a little privatisation inevitably ends up with a lot,\" he said.</p> <p>Sir Christopher, who spent more than a decade at ITV before leaving television and then returning to become chairman of the BBC, said he thought restrictions on the number of advertising minutes allowed each hour should be relaxed.</p> <p>\"The time has come to remove advertising minute restrictions both within the hour and the day,\" he insisted. </p> <p>\"Commercial TV is the only business where advertisers want more but broadcasters can't deliver it.\" </p> <p>He also called for increased quotas for independent production companies, saying: \"The great weakness is there aren't enough of them and they aren't strong enough. </p> <p>\"The only way to rectify that is to increase quotas to 40% over the next three to five years. At the same time, we need to widen rather than restrict the definition of 'independent'.\"</p> <p>Sir Christopher also criticised the BBC over its handling of the controversial Andrew Gilligan affair last summer.</p> <p>He implied his old friend Greg Dyke had got it wrong when he blamed the board of governors for the cataclysmic events that led to the sacking of the BBC director general and the chairman, Gavyn Davies.</p> <p>\"What's happening with BBC governance is drawing the wrong lessons about Hutton. The BBC got it wrong not because of failure of the system but of failure of men and women,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Restructuring the governors doesn't deal with the problem. In my view it makes it much worse. \" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "U2 frontman Bono addressed the Labour conference this afternoon with an unambiguous message for the party: Africa needs your help. <p>In an echo of Bob Geldof's 1984 campaign to Feed the World, the singer talked about his experiences in Africa and warned Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, with whom he shared a platform, that delivering justice for Africa would cost money.</p> <p>Delegates waited for over an hour to hear his speech, enduring the strictest security checks yet (\"Do you have any pockets? What's in them?\"). In return, they heard a mostly subdued, heartfelt, self-deprecating appeal from the U2 star. </p> <p>\"You may now kneel,\" he told the hall after they gave him a standing ovation, for a speech which took up this week's rallying call to the party's grassroots: We've had our differences, let's unite for the sake of a greater good.</p> <p>He made no bones about his opposition to the war. Bono's disdain for the Bush administration was obvious, even if the US was seldom mentioned by name: \"Surely it's cheaper, and smarter, to make friends out of potential enemies than it is to defend yourself against them. Can I just say that again?\"</p> <p>Sceptics may wince at his undisguised admiration for the prime minister and, especially, his chancellor: \"They are kind of the John [Lennon] and Paul [McCartney] of the global development stage, in my opinion.\" But Bono had a riposte: drop the cynicism, let's work for the important stuff. </p> <p>\"If Britain can't turn its values into action against extreme, stupid poverty ... then the critics tomorrow will be right: I am Tony Blair's apologist.\"</p> <p>There was bad language (\"horseshit\" in the draft of the speech became \"bollocks\" on the podium) and unsparing attacks on European Union agricultural subsidies, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the EU: \"Onerous trade burdens, duplicitous trade rules, no wonder people are pissed off with us.\"</p> <p>The conference loved it. It may not come up on the doorsteps come next May, but it did push Africa back towards the top of Tony Blair's agenda, which is exactly where he wants it.</p>",
  "<p>Three Gypsies today claimed an important human rights victory after a court of appeal ruling put more pressure on councils to find sites for Travellers' mobile homes. </p> <p>The Gypsies overturned a high court ruling that blocked permission for their families to live on land in Chichester, West Sussex. </p> <p>High court judge Mr Justice Blackburne had overruled a government planning inspector's decision that planning permission should be granted on human rights grounds.</p> <p>Although the Gypsy families had originally gone on the land without permission, the inspector took into account that Chichester district council had failed to provide sites in its area for Gypsies and other travelling people in line with government guidance. </p> <p>The high court ruled that the inspector had erred when applying human rights law. But today, in a 2 to 1 majority decision, the court of appeal backed the inspector's judgement and reinstated his decision. </p> <p>Lord Justice Wall and Mr Justice Pumfrey backed the appeal. Lord Justice Auld disagreed with them on the human rights issue, but said the appeal should be allowed on other planning grounds. </p> <p>Lord Justice Wall said the inspector had found the council had breached government guidance on help being given to gypsies, and the consequence was \"that there was little credible prospect of any private Gypsy site being permitted by the council.\"</p> <p>At stake was the right of the families \"to respect for the homes which they had created - homes admittedly created in breach of planning laws,\" said the judge.</p> <p>The decision to serve enforcement notices on the families to get them off the land interfered with those rights, which were protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. </p> <p>The inspector was entitled to find that, against the background of a lack of sites, such interference was not \"justified or proportionate\".</p> <p>Mr Justice Pumfrey agreed, saying the inspector was entitled to balance the shortage of sites against the \"planning harm\" to the environment of granting permission. </p> <p>The inspector had found the site was in \"ordinary countryside\" not subject to any special designation, had no recognised nature conservation value, or archaeological or declared historical value. </p> <p>The judge referred to a 1994 government circular giving guidance on Gypsy sites and planning. The circular was issued following the repeal of the 1968 Caravan Sites Act, part II - which had obliged county councils to provide caravan pitches. </p> <p>The new guidance encouraged Gypsies to secure their own sites, making use of the planning process when necessary. </p> <p>Mr Justice Pumfrey said that the circular stated that the land-use requirements of Gypsies \"need to be met\", and also pointed out that the repeal of the statutory duty on county councils to provide sites \"will make it all the more important that local planning authorities make adequate Gypsy site provision in their development plans.\"</p> <p>The landmark ruling was won by Grant Doe, Gregory Yates and Paul Eames and their families, who all moved on to land in West Ashling in December 2001.</p> <p>Their subsequent applications for planning permission were rejected by the district council and enforcement notices issued requiring the residential use of the site to cease.</p> <p>Mr Yates, spokesman for the Gypsies and owner of the land, said later: \"This is an important case for all Gypsies because it will affect many other cases in the future. Councils must take note of the guidelines, and it is important that they identity sites in their areas to be developed.\"</p>",

  "<p>The chances of another rise in interest rates faded today as mortgage lending slowed to its lowest level for a year during August.</p> <p>In an another sign that the series of interest rate rises since last November is having an effect, consumer confidence fell this month to its lowest in 18 months.</p> <p>The market research group GfK Martin Hamblin said its monthly barometer of British consumer sentiment slipped to minus seven in September from minus five in August, the lowest since minus 10 in March 2003 at the start of the Iraq war. September's drop was led by deterioration in perceptions about personal finances over the last 12 months.</p> <p>Earlier, the Bank of England said that mortgage lending had slowed during August, supporting recent surveys from mortgage lenders that the housing market is coming off the boil. The Bank said lending secured on dwellings grew by \u00a38.4bn in August compared with \u00a38.7bn in July.</p> <p>The number of new mortgage approvals, loans agreed but not yet made, fell for the third straight month to 96,000 in August from 100,000 in July, the lowest since November 2000. </p> <p>As well as the slowdown in mortgage lending and the drop in consumer confidence, the Confederation of British Industry reported an unexpected drop in retail sales in September. The CBI's monthly distributive trades survey showed the weakest retail performance since March 2003.</p> <p>Today's data prompted analysts to reconsider their previous forecasts of one more interest rate rise this year. Base rates now stand at 4.75% after five interest rate rises since last November. Most economists had been expecting another tightening before the end of the year, but as further evidence emerges of a slowdown in the housing market, those predictions are being revised.</p> <p>\"It seems increasingly likely that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged for the rest of this year, and we are becoming ever less confident in our current forecast of a 25 basis point hike in November,\" said Howard Archer, an economist with the consultancy Global Insight.</p> <p>Some analysts warned, however, that a premature end to the current round of interest rate rises could spark a resurgence of consumer spending.</p> <p>\"There is a real danger that a softer tone from the Bank of England about the outlook for interest rates sparks a re-acceleration in consumer activity later in the year. While that uncertainty persists, the Bank is likely to be reluctant to signal the peak in the interest rate cycle,\" said John Butler, an economist with HBSC bank.</p> <p>There was some evidence in the Bank of England figures that consumers have not quite yet thrown in the towel. While mortgage lending is slowing down, the Bank reported that unsecured lending remained strong. </p> <p>In August, unsecured lending rose by \u00a31.8bn compared with a rise of \u00a31.7bn in July, roughly in line with market expectations. Within that, lending on credit cards rose by \u00a3901m, the biggest gain since March.</p> <p>The figure suggests that consumers, who have so far amassed more than \u00a31,000bn of outstanding debt, have not lost their appetite for borrowing just yet. Still, total personal borrowing was up by its weakest amount this year, rising by \u00a310.2bn compared with \u00a310.5bn in July.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair yesterday offered critics of his Iraq war strategy his most contrite justification for the conflict so far but stopped short of an outright apology, removing the word \"sorry\" from the text of his speech to Labour's Brighton conference in frantic last-minute rewriting. </p> <p>\"I know this issue has divided the country. I entirely understand why many disagree,\" he told the conference. Journalists had been briefed that he would say \"I am genuinely sorry about that\" between the two sentences, but it was removed.</p> <p>Mr Blair's attempt to assuage party members over Iraq was combined with a bullish blueprint for a 21st century \"opportunity society\" which won him a five-minute standing ovation from wary delegates.</p> <p>Mr Blair boasted that Labour would deliver equality of choice to all. \"Choice is not a Tory word,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister made clear his determination to drive Labour towards a third lease on political power, swatting aside the double interruption of pro-hunting and anti-Iraq protesters in the hall.</p> <p>Unless tomorrow's Hartlepool byelection proves disastrous, the speech should give him a political breathing space. But the prime minister's justification for Iraq failed to impress his toughest critics, particularly after it emerged that he had watered down his language.</p> <p>In the crucial passage, heard in attentive silence, he admitted that his prediction on weapons of mass destruction \"has turned out to be wrong, I acknowledge and accept that.\" But he insisted he could not apologise for removing Saddam Hussein from power. \"The world is a better place with Saddam in prison,\" he said.</p> <p>Where his speech differed from past attempts to resolve the controversy came in the conversational way he voiced people's fears that he was dis tracted from home affairs, \"just pandering to George Bush\", or had made the world a more dangerous place.</p> <p>\"Do I know I'm right? Judg ments aren't the same as facts. Instinct is not science. I'm like any other human being, as fallible and as capable of being wrong. I only know what I believe,\" he said. There were ripples of applause from some.</p> <p>Mr Blair insisted there were only two ways of viewing the terrorist threat since 9/11, either as \"isolated individual extremists\" as have always existed, or as \"a wholly new phenomenon, worldwide global terrorism\" based on a perversion of Islam - its Saudi roots deep in many countries.</p> <p>Those who took the first view would say of the terror in Iraq: \"Look what you have stirred up; now stop provoking them.\" Whereas his own view required the west to confront and remove this threat \"root and branch\".</p> <p>The main aim of the speech, as Downing Street gears up for a general election which may come as early as May 5, next year was to flag up 10 campaign themes centred on the public services.</p> <p>Most of his themes were within striking distance of Gordon Brown's vision of a \"progressive consensus\" in his speech on Monday. But the emphasis on choice - Mr Blair uses the word eight times - could yet cause tension between the chancellor and prime minister over Labour's manifesto.</p> <p>Last night cabinet allies and loyalists were confident that Labour's big beasts would unite. \"They must, there's an election coming,\" said one senior minister. Others praised another bravura Blair perfor mance - more measured and less histrionic than usual - which combined acknowledgment of the \"trust\" problem with frequent echoes of Mr Brown's \"progressive politics.\"</p> <p>The Conservative chairman, Dr Liam Fox, accused him of being \"out of touch\" and said: \"It's all talk, we have heard it all before.\" Labour strategists are confident he is wrong and Mr Blair's rejection of Tory \"ruling class\" concepts - \"the rulers are the people,\" he declared - was well received.</p> <p>Echoing Mr Brown, Mr Blair also argued that Labour's fairness agenda - in health, schooling and beyond - is the best guard against extremism everywhere, including Britain.</p> <p>\"The irony for me is that I, as a progressive politician, know that despite the opposition of so much of progressive politics to what I've done, the only lasting way to defeat terrorism is through progressive politics,\" he said.</p> <p>There was much else in Mr Blair's \"third term mission to change Britain for good\" that the watching chancellor could approve, including his pledge of more help for Africa and his insistence that Britain can only be effective if it is allied to the US - \"little will happen\" without it - and at the centre of an enlarged Europe.</p> <p>Away from the ritualised cheers and the hugs from Cherie Blair, in the real conference arena, the leadership suffered a symbolic defeat yesterday: it was confirmed that delegates voted 60-40 in favour of rail renationalisation.</p>",
  "<p>The floods in north-west Haiti have come just four months after a similar catastrophe claimed the lives of more than 2,500 people in the Caribbean country's south-east border region. Then, flash floods and mudslides decimated the remote communities of Fond Verrettes and Mapou, whereas now the focus is on the massive loss of life in the sprawling slum that is the city of Gona\u00efves. </p> <p>In both cases, the immediate cause is the absence of trees on the country's hills and mountains, leaving a surface unable to absorb any rainfall. But these disasters demand deeper consideration of why Haiti in particular suffers - and why its people will inevitably suffer again. </p> <p>Blame for the deforestation that has reduced tree cover from an estimated 60% in 1923, to less than 2% today, falls easily on the country's peasant farmers, who make up nearly two-thirds of the population. But while they do indeed cut down the trees, they are not the guilty ones. </p> <p>Haiti's peasants are desperately poor; four out of five farmers cannot satisfy their families' basic food needs. When you have nothing to eat, no animals to slaughter, no seeds to plant, nothing to sell, no prospect of finding paid work and your children's hair is turning orange because of malnutrition, what can you do? Felling saplings and digging roots to produce a sack of charcoal to sell for cash is, for many, a matter of life or death. </p> <p>Part of the reason why the Haitian countryside got in such a state goes back to the country's birth as an independent nation 200 years ago. In the 19th century, former slaves and their descendants took what they most wanted - their own land - when and where they could find it. A nation of smallholders developed. Meanwhile, the country's ruling elite congregated in the coastal towns, living off the spoils of agricultural export taxes and plundering the national treasury. </p> <p>This situation remained pretty much the same until the middle of the last century, by which time individual landholdings had been divided into smaller and smaller plots over succes sive generations. Farming methods had remained primitive, and the continual need to produce crops to live on meant that farm land was being consistently overworked. As yields decreased, peasant farmers could not afford to leave land idle, nor allow trees to remain where new crops could be planted. </p> <p>Haitian agronomists and foreign development experts have been considering the relationship between land use, farming techniques and soil erosion since the 1940s. Remedies were proposed, but under the Duvalier family dictatorship (1957-86), Haiti's well-established corrupt style of government was taken to new extremes. Taxes went up and prices paid for agricultural surpluses went down. The pressure on the land grew ever greater. </p> <p>When democratic government was restored in 1994, following three years of military rule, there was a chance to implement bold moves to address the rural crisis. But the Haitian government was entirely dependent on foreign assistance, and the structural adjustment policies favoured by the international finance institutions (IFIs) had no place for agricultural development. </p> <p>In a leaked paper in 1996, the World Bank warned that two-thirds of the country's workers based on the land would be unlikely to survive the economic measures demanded by the bank and the International Monetary Fund. It concluded that the rural population would be left with only two possibilities: to work in the industrial or service sector, or to emigrate. </p> <p>This has come to pass. Foreign aid to Haiti has been turned on and off, but nearly all of it has been allocated to governance, security, elections and support for the private sector. Next to nothing has been done to support the agricultural sector - no land reform, no subsidies for fertilisers or storage facilities, no subsidised credit, no reforestation campaign, and no irrigation projects. At the same time, the free-marketeers have insisted on the reduction - and, in some cases, the elimination - of import tariffs, effectively destroying much local food production. </p> <p>A ministry of the environment set up in early 1995 had plans to reduce urban consumers' demand for charcoal by promoting the use of gas stoves, to explore the option of importing alternative fuels, and to reforest mountain areas where key watersheds were located. </p> <p>However, none of these initiatives ever got off the ground because only 0.2% of the US$560 million foreign assistance that was allocated to Haiti during the mid- to late-1990s was assigned to the environment. </p> <p>The new government, formed following the fall of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February, is led by Gerard Latortue, a veteran of the UN system, and is stuffed with technocrats who are well aware of the IFI's preferences. Its decision to downgrade the environment ministry to a state secretariat gives a clear indication of its sense of priorities. </p> <p>In May and June this year, while the south-west was still recovering from its fatal floods, hundreds of development experts were flown to Haiti to help the new government draw up plans for economic renewal. At an international donors conference in Washington DC in July, pledges of support exceeded the government's request for $1.37bn. Less than 10% of this total was allocated to the agricultural sector, and less than 2% for environmental protection and rehabilitation. </p> <p>By doing nothing to support the poverty-stricken peasantry, the international community is complicit in the loss of life and misery caused by this year's \"natural\" disasters in Haiti. More tragic still is the realisation that, if things continue as they are, future catastrophes are inevitable. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Charles Arthur is author of Haiti in Focus (published by Latin America Bureau, 2002).

  "Burberry, once a modest and slightly stuffy British clothing company, has been transformed in the past decade into a multi-million-pound global luxury brand, one of the few to rival Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior for worldwide recognition. <p>This, clearly, is no mean feat. But brand awareness, the holy grail of marketing, is a double edged sword, as Burberry knows all too well. </p> <p>Once that distinctive camel-coloured check spills from the linings of raincoats in the English countryside to be worn by celebrities and plastered over billboards, it develops a momentum that is hard to control from HQ. </p> <p>It is a momentum which put Burberry in the headlines for all the wrong reasons when a pub chain banned wearers of the famous check because it had become associated with hooliganism. </p> <p>But Burberry has a powerful antidote. Its catwalk line, designed by the 33-year-old Briton Christopher Bailey but shown in Milan fashion week, is fast becoming one of the most highly acclaimed labels. </p> <p>Certainly there were no signs of a credibility problem at last night's show. The check took a noticeably low profile, appearing on a few handbags but no clothes. Instead, Bailey riffed brilliantly on the other Burberry signature, the trenchcoat. </p> <p>Watched from the front row by Kate Moss in a black trenchcoat from the current autumn range, this collection for next summer began with a powder blue cotton trenchcoat with three-quarter sleeves and a softly gathered waist instead of a belt, worn over a patchwork floral sundress. </p> <p>Next came a swingy jacket version of the trenchcoat in pale pink, falling softly from the shoulders but cropped to waist length; later, a lipstick-red trench was belted but cropped at the hipbone. </p> <p>It is probably no coincidence that Bailey worked under Tom Ford, the modern master of fashion brand-building, in his heyday at Gucci from 1996 to 2001. He has Ford's knack for using the catwalk to give a big company with many elements a strong identity, and fusing elements of a brand's heritage with new ideas. </p> <p>They say the best dressed man is an Englishman with an Italian tailor, or vice versa, and this marriage of tastes is much in evidence at Burberry. </p> <p>This was in many ways a very British collection - who after all but a rain-hardened Brit would design a summer outfit made up of a skirt, a blouse, a cardigan, jacket and scarf, but with touches of very Milanese sophistication. </p> <p>There were echoes of Prada in the cardigans and broaches, and of Marni in the fit of the jackets. The overall effect was pure class, a neat answer to the baseball cap brigade.</p>",
  "<p>Capital and GWR today announced their \u00a3711m merger, creating the country's biggest radio group in a deal that changes the shape of the British radio industry.</p> <p>The merger - which brings GWR's Classic FM together with Capital and Xfm stations in London - will give Capital 52% of the merged company and GWR shareholders holding 48%.</p> <p>The merger also presents a direct challenge to the BBC with the enlarged group targeting a higher share of the total UK listenership for commercial radio. </p> <p>GWR executive chairman Ralph Bernard said: \"This merger is a fantastic opportunity to create UK commercial radio's champion of the digital age.\" </p> <p>Capital, which claims to reach more than half the UK population, has made no secret of its ambition to expand through acquisitions. </p> <p>The group's radio stations include Capital FM, Century FM, Capital Gold and Xfm, as well as regional stations such as Red Dragon in South Wales and BRMB in the Midlands. </p> <p>GWR boasts more licences and a larger audience share than any other commercial radio group in the UK, with stations including Classic FM, as well as 33 local offerings such as Essex FM, Leicester Sound and Trent FM. </p> <p>The merged group, which is yet to be named, will own one national and 55 local analogue radio stations, 93 digital radio stations and will reach approximately 18 million listeners representing 36% of the UK commercial radio audience.</p> <p>City objections over division of management appear to have been assuaged with proprosals to maintain Mr Bernard's executive chairman's role alongside that of Capital Radio chief executive, David Mansfield.</p> <p>The new finance director of the merged operation will be GWR finance director Wendy Pallot - it is not clear yet where Capital's Peter Harris will end up.</p> <p>The non-executive directors will be drawn from the boards of Capital and GWR, ensuring both companies are equally represented. </p> <p>DMGT has got its wish for a seat on the board with a member of its company to be invited to become a non-executive director. DMGT finance director Peter Williams already sits on GWR's board and is likely to take the postition.</p> <p>Based on the latest published financial results for both companies, the merged group will have a combined turnover of \u00a3243m combined EBITDA of \u00a353m and combined profit before tax of \u00a340m. </p> <p>The merger is conditional on regulatory approval but it is not thought there are any significant obstacles to the marriage going ahead.</p> <p>Daily Mail &amp; General Trust and the directors of GWR, who hold a total of approximately 35.1% of GWR's shares, have undertaken to accept the merger offer. </p> <p>A statement issued to the City this morning said DMGT was \"very supportive\" of the merger and will remain a shareholder in the new group for the \"foreseeable future\".</p> <p>Based on share prices at closing on September 17, the last trading day before the announcement that Capital and GWR were in merger discussions, the new group's combined market capitalisation would have been approximately \u00a3711m.</p> <p>The tie-up has long been touted by analysts as an excellent fit because both companies are radio-only groups - unlike most other holders of radio assets - and have very little geographical overlap that might prompt regulatory concerns. </p> <p>It is the first major radio deal that has been sealed since the Communications Act relaxed ownership rules and paves the way for further links.</p> <p>The company is hoping to head off the concerns of investors over Mr Bernard's position as executive chairman, which contravenes City guidelines on corporate governance.</p> <p>A year ago Michael Green was kicked out of the ITV chairmanship for the same reason, though in that case investors wanted blood following the \u00a31bn ITV Digital fiasco.</p> <p>Mr Bernard said the merger was a \"fantastic opportunity to create UK commercial radio's champion of the digital age\".</p> <p>\"The enlarged group will be in a strong position to drive the growth of commercial radio's share of listening and total advertising by providing enhanced services to listeners and greater opportunities for advertisers. We expect this to deliver increased value to shareholders over time.\"</p> <p>Mr Mansfield added that the merger created \"a vibrant new radio business\" with the two companies sharing \"strategies and values\" and having complementary brands and geographical areas.</p> <p>\"In addition to the synergies that we have identified, we will concentrate our efforts on further value creation over time by combining the strongest qualities of both companies within the new group,\" he said.</p> <p>The combined group brings together GWR's 33 analogue stations, including national broadcaster Classic FM, and Capital Radio's 21 analogue stations, including Capital FM, London's most popular radio station. </p> <p>It will also have a leading presence in digital radio, inheriting GWR's 63% share of the national digital multiplex and stations includingPlanet Rock and Core. </p> <p>Following months of speculation, GWR and Capital confirmed that they were discussing a merger 10 days ago.</p> <p>The news quickened the pace of negotiations for the rest of the industry.</p> <p>Emap - owner of Magic and Kiss - is now expected to move for the 72% of Scottish Radio Holdings it does not own, while Chrysalis could be tempted into a tie-up with Guardian Media Group, the owner of Jazz FM. </p> <p>A question mark also hangs over Virgin Radio, owned by SMG, which could be the target of a number of radio companies. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who grew up there always suspected that Luton was crap; this week we have had official confirmation. In a survey for a forthcoming book 20,000 people were asked which was the worst place to live in Britain; my home town romped to victory with almost 2,000 votes. In a pathetic display of civic pride, only five Lutonians were willing to defend their town. Let's make that six. I should clarify that I am not denying that Luton is crap; the evidence of its crappy status is pretty irrefutable. But rather than this being a source of embarrassment, those of us who come from Britain's crappiest towns ought to celebrate the fact that they are so rubbish. </p> <p>Those who want to mock Luton have plenty of ammunition. From Lorraine Chase in those 70s Campari advertisements to the inevitable Arndale Centre; from its unwelcome reputation as a hotbed of British Muslim fundamentalism to its crap university, Luton has for my entire life been less of a town than a one-word punchline to a bad joke. According to one contributor to the survey, the town is a \"brick and iron temple to global pollution\". Another describes it as \"dreary, concrete and polluted. An archetypal conurbation town with no basic infrastructure or amenities for culture or entertainment. No sense of history. Nothing to inspire or stimulate, just houses.\" He should have been there in the 80s when it was really bad. </p> <p>But the Luton I visit these days is a far more exciting and thriving town than the one I grew up in. What I hated most about it then wasn't that there was nothing to do and nowhere to go, it wasn't the ugly undercurrent of imminent violence that descended when darkness fell. No, what I most resented was my hometown's utter lack of ambition. It is better now: the university might be one of the worst in Britain but it does at least bring in young people from outside, and that influx of students has boosted the cultural and economic health of the town. As well as the students, the most significant new group moving into Luton are professionals and couples from London; frustrated with paying obscene amounts for their one-bedroom flats, they are busy buying spacious three-bedroom houses in leafy streets with huge gardens. </p> <p>What these new Lutonians have grasped is what those raised there cannot: it is only outsiders and those who have moved away who can see their hometowns accurately; those who are still there cannot see the wood for the trees, or the multi-storey car parks for the multi-screen entertainment complex. </p> <p>When I used to return home from university as a student my head would begin throbbing with a dull ache as the train approached Luton. By the time I had reached the train station I would be in the midst of a full-blown migraine that would only lift once I was on my way back to undergraduate life. These days I actually look forward to going back - not only because the town is a nicer place than it was, but because I appreciate it in a way I could not when I lived there. </p> <p>That is why I think it a little unfair for it to have been voted the worst place in Britain. But other entries in the survey are even more mystifying. Granted, Luton can still be grim - a recent Nasa probe revealed that Mars has more of an atmosphere than Luton town centre on a Saturday night - but is beautiful Edinburgh really the fourth worst place in Britain? Do Bath, London and Windsor deserve to be in the top 20? Clearly the findings have less to do with the traditional criteria - house prices, crime levels, quality of schools - than how the residents feel about where they live. </p> <p>There is an old Bruce Springsteen line that goes: \"It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win.\" The truth is that most people come from dull, soul-destroying towns like Luton, but some of us manage to leave. For those who do get out, it is the very grim, crushing drabness of their home towns that provides the motivation to get out and inspires their best work. In the same way that young children are deliberately exposed to diseases to stop them later catching the much nastier adult version, I am grateful that I came from Luton because it made me immune to many of the things that make others so miserable. </p> <p>I am able to enjoy my London life so much more knowing where I came from and occasionally return to. Those who grew up in more interesting and less crap places lack the perspective that comes from having spent a childhood where the highlight of a Saturday afternoon was to stare at the plastic pink flamingos in the Arndale Centre. </p> <p>There is, of course, an unmistakeable air of snobbery around the people behind such a book; the stench of rich kids having fun at the expense of those less able to afford to be professionally idle. But rather than sneering at towns such as Luton, we should be applauding the contribution that crap towns have made to all our lives. Whether it is Newark (home town of Philip Roth), Coventry (Philip Larkin), Salford (Morrissey) or Stoke (Robbie Williams), crap towns have always inspired and motivated those with bigger dreams. </p> <p>What this week's survey most starkly reveals is not how crap Luton is but the festering self-hatred of those who continue to live in crap towns leading crap lives that they wish they could escape. In their fury at the mediocrity of their own lives, they rush to blame the place they come from. There is no shame in coming from a crap town; the real crime is to remain there.</p>",

  "<p>Members of the finance union Unifi are stepping up their protests over HSBC's plans to move jobs abroad, by demonstrating outside the bank's branches and warning customers of deteriorating service. </p> <p>Unifi, which has merged with Amicus, intends to hand out postcards on Saturday at a handful of high-profile HSBC branches in an attempt to convince customers to sign a petition calling for the protection of jobs and customer service. </p> <p>Rob O'Neill, a Unifi official, said: \"We believe that having to deal with global service centres is so unpopular among customers that they will start to vote with their feet and switch to banks that use solely UK staff. We are worried as this could result in further job losses in the UK.\" </p> <p>HSBC has announced plans to cut 7,500 jobs in Britain, with about 4,500 of those the result of a decision to move work to countries where labour costs are less, such as India and Malaysia. </p> <p>Unifi cited a staff survey that showed customers were finding it difficult to deal with global processing centres because of language and cultural differences. </p> <p>HSBC insists the change has not damaged customer service. A spokesman said research by external consultants continued to rank HSBC above its peer group for customer service. The bank says none of the jobs cut so far has required compulsory redundancy. </p> <p>Unifi hopes customers will send the postcards, bearing the slogan \"keep HSBC jobs local\", to the bank's chief executive. The message is a play on the bank's boast that it is the \"world's local bank\". </p> <p>Unifi has been expressing concern about HSBC plans to move service centres offshore as well as initiatives implemented by Michael Geoghegan, the chief executive of the UK operations, to boost sales. </p> <p>He has pledged to make an aggressive assault on the high street with a range of simpler banking, savings and insurance products. He has told staff he is determined to boost the bank's market shares and fight back against Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>HSBC has a 15% share of current accounts and a 4% share of the mortgage market. </p> <p>While many other financial services firms are using off-shore centres to process work previously done in Britain, HSBC appears to be incurring most of the wrath of unions in the sector.

  "<p>For now, the \"hygiene kit\" - soap, candles, matches, two mosquito nets and basic clothing - is all that stands between the family of six and disease as this summer's catastrophic monsoon floodwaters finally recede. </p> <p>\"We tried to stay in our home, but it was too dangerous and we had to go to the relief shelter [in a neighbouring school],\" Helena, 27, says. \"People helped each other with food but our house was destroyed, apart from the roof and one wall. We have moved back and patched up the walls with paper.\" </p> <p>The Chaudhurys' village, Velanagar in Narshindi, three hours' drive along rain-damaged roads north-east of the capital, Dhaka, is typical of thousands of settlements battered this year by a double wave of fatal flooding. </p> <p>In July and August, half of Bangladesh was inundated by rains and river flooding that killed more than 760 people, affected more than 30 million, and washed away untold numbers of homes, roads and vital subsistence crops. </p> <p>Then earlier this month, as global attention turned to the hurricanes lashing the Caribbean and Florida, and then to lethal flooding in Haiti, Bangladesh endured its heaviest rain in 50 years, inundating the already saturated land and devastating recovery efforts. </p> <p>While children caught fish in the contaminated metre-deep floodwaters of Dhaka's streets, hectares of aman rice seedlings and other crops planted after the August rains were washed away and hundreds more villages, particularly in the south-west which had escaped the worst of the earlier floods, were inundated. </p> <p>Aid agencies warn that the consequences of this little acknowledged double tragedy is a disaster on a far larger scale than first recognised in a low-lying country wearily familiar with annual flooding. </p> <p>Unicef and the world food programme warn that within six weeks, without rapid medical and food aid, more than a million Bangladeshi children risk acute illness or death through malnutrition. More than 500,000 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are also seen by aid experts as acutely vulnerable. </p> <p>The latest UN assessment warns that most areas will need food at least until the aman rice harvest in December, with some requiring much longer support if that crop fails. </p> <p>In Velanagar, where surrounding fields still lie under sheets of floodwater, hygiene kits funded by the British government and distributed by Islamic Relief will be followed by a fresh round of food rations containing rice, dahl, oil and salt. </p> <p><strong>Famine</strong><br> </p> <p>\"We are expecting a potential famine-like situation in December,\" said Ahmed Nasr of Islamic Relief. \"It could be compounded by the cold when the temperature drops to around 7C during the winter. The children do not have the clothes to protect them and at least 6,000 families in this area have to rebuild their homes.\" </p> <p>Further north-east, at the village of Dakshin Bejora in Thana Madhabpur region, children with bright orange-and-yellow hair ribbons dance in a primary school rebuilt out of corrugated iron after waist-high floodwaters swept away its woven jute walls. </p> <p>After abandoning their homes for the worst flooding, the 1,500 villagers have returned to try to nurture their waterlogged crops of rice and jute. </p> <p>Sitting in a one-room hut, Shirina Akhtar, 25, points to her family's single platform bed propped up on four bricks in a vain effort to elevate it above the first floods. \"At first we hoped to stay here, but we have two small daughters and it was not safe when the waters came so high,\" she says. </p> <p>Shirina has taken out a 1,000 taka (\u00a310) loan from the charity Brac to repair her home with corrugated iron, but must pay the money back from her husband's meagre seasonal income as a farm labourer. </p> <p>The central government, which drew back from early appeals for international aid so as to demonstrate that the impoverished country can cope with floods, is now seeking help to repair some of the \u00a34bn in damage to agriculture, industry and infrastructure which will take years to complete. </p> <p>International donors and governments including the UK, which has given \u00a325m in aid on top of its \u00a3100m annual development funding, want Bangladesh's BNP-led coalition to place more focus on flood prevention, including the dredging of rivers and canals to allow better drainage, and better engineering and use of vegetation to shore up embankments. Emergency measures such as the building of more and better flood shelters - typically in raised school buildings - and investing in more rescue boats are also seen as vital. </p> <p>Oona King, the Labour MP whose Bethnal Green and Bow constituency is home to the largest concentration of Bangladeshi people outside the country, said after visiting the flood zone last week: \"It is critical that the government and donors both recognise the double blow of this year's floods, but also the need to build in disaster preparedness into everything they do.\" </p> <p>Ministers in Dhaka now acknowledge the scale of this year's disaster, but seem torn between resignation and determination to find more permanent solutions.

  "<p>Before TV, few people had an appreciation of the natural world. But in the past 40 years, western audiences have been able to observe coral reefs, tropical rainforests, African savannahs and countless other natural habitats. Like great works of art or historical buildings, wildlife and their habitats are now regarded as things to cherish. This has had positive results. Once television had revealed whales as beautiful, living creatures threatened with extinction, the demise of the whaling industry in the western world became inevitable. </p> <p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, a few analogue television channels dominated the choice of viewing, so wildlife programming could be viewed by very large audiences. Even commercial broadcasters turned to wildlife to build their ratings. Then, an audience of 10m on the BBC was common for a wildlife documentary, whereas today only half of that is expected. </p> <p>Most programmes concentrated on revealing the wonders of the natural world, rather than its destruction. Many criticised this, but wildlife documentaries were reaching unprecedented numbers of people and building a greater and greater sense of value for the natural world - an aspect often taken for granted, but one that may be sorely missed in the future as broadcasting changes. </p> <p>Some \"environmental\" programmes directly tackled conservation issues successfully, but many were unfocused - not rigorous enough in their journalism, and just regurgitating beliefs rather than investigating the issues. This was not helped by a lack of prioritisation by the conservation bodies that raised the concerns. The public was bombarded by a multitude of issues, each with its own wide set of problems and rarely any clear solutions. This certainly created a sense of global environmental destruction, but so often any clear solution to avert it remained obscure, and a sense of public hopelessness ensued. </p> <p>But the real problem with environmental programming was that it did not rate. In general, the harder the content, the smaller the audiences. There were exceptions, such as David Attenborough's State of the Planet, but in the majority of cases only a conventional wildlife film stood a good chance of reaching a big global audience. </p> <p>But what of the future? Broadcasting is now entering its \"digital age\" of multiple channels, interactivity and a growing number of new media platforms. The old massive audiences of analogue television are being fragmented into those of smaller and smaller digital channels and other digital services. It is becoming increasingly difficult to reach the uninterested and ill-informed about any specific subject, and this proportion of the public is set to grow. </p> <p>Added to this, there is a downturn in the commercial success of wildlife programming. This is already prevalent in the US, where the commercial channels that used to show many hours of wildlife programmes in peak time are switching to other subjects, to keep their advertising revenues afloat. </p> <p>My worry is that as the overall output of wildlife programmes falls around the globe, or is marginalised into small \"digital ghettoes\", this sense of the natural world's value will decrease, especially among the younger generations. If this happens, any hope of galvanising global political will to change events will become increasingly difficult. </p> <p>It is becoming clear that, in the digital media world of the future, only a few clear messages stand a chance of breaking through to large audiences. To meet this reality, organisations with an interest in global conservation will have to find a way of prioritising environmental issues, and agreeing on the desired outcomes. </p> <p>It is essential also to gain an understanding of how digital broadcasting is changing, and how the audiences of the future will be reached and engaged. It is arguable that the move from the more passive act of watching television to a more interactive form of engagement provides far better tools to bring about individual action. In the digital future, while it may not be possible to broadcast to millions at one time, it will be possible to have a myriad conversations with individuals. This may be a far better way of turning a sense of value for nature into actions to save it. </p> <p>Could it be that this revolution, if grasped and harnessed, could prove to be the way that wildlife programming can finally change the future of nature, rather than just building its value? Let's hope so, because the next half-century is likely to produce the greatest rate of change our planet has known. Informed sources predict that up to 80% of species may be gone by the turn of this century. As our world rapidly changes and nature enters the eye of its extinction storm, understanding how to get the best out of the digital revolution might just give life on earth a better chance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Keith Scholey, controller of the BBC's specialist factual programme departments, was head of the BBC's natural history unit from 1998 to 2003.

The trendsetters may well have been in London, but the blokes overwhelmingly were not. </p> <p>We happened to be located in Manchester, but it wouldn't have mattered if it had been Bristol or Newcastle; it just had to be somewhere away from London so people could see that we could push homosexual law reform forward in the provinces without the sky falling in. </p> <p>I was working for the National Coal Board at that time, and living in a house that belonged to the coal board in the middle of Atherton, a mining village in the south Lancashire coal field. I got our committee notepaper printed with my address and we launched our first leaflet, 10,000 copies, and sent it to social workers, gay groups, and to the press of course. </p> <p>The local paper ran a front page feature with a banner headline, and I thought all hell was going to break loose. Not a murmur. No letters opposing it, no hostility from neighbours, not much at work. I thought: \"Well, this really can't be as controversial as people are trying to make out.\" So we put more leaflets out, inviting people to support us. </p> <p>Denis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsolver, wrote in the New Statesman: \"Well, yes, reform might be very admirable, but no way will it go down in my constituency with the miners.\" So I replied, saying: \"Well, I'm publishing from the middle of a mining village, and I find it all right. I don't know what Skinner's on about.\" </p> <p>We tried to set up a social organisation called Esquire Clubs Limited. We almost got there in Burnley; we had lined up a lease on old assembly rooms in the centre of the town. We had enough money, and willing hands to do it up ourselves, but someone leaked it to BBC Blackburn. All hell broke loose. The church were after us; even the local doctors formed a committee to oppose it. We held a public meeting to try to explain our plans in Burnley public library in the town centre, and it was packed, priests getting up and bringing down hell fire on us, councillors, everyone. </p> <p>The police were so fearful of violence that they made teddy boys take their boots off outside and leave them on the lawn, so there was a line of boots on the lawn with lads going into the meeting in bare feet. Michael Steed, who was once president of the Liberal Party, said it was the greatest meeting he'd ever been to. But we got disheartened and CHE remained as a campaigning group. </p> <p>CHE peaked in the mid-70s, but then it began to lose its edge. The Gay Liberation Front was formed and people began to look on CHE as being too formal, too structured. </p> <p>Society as a whole has become more tolerant. But there is always an intolerant minority that can make life very difficult for you. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> From The Unsung Sixties, by Helene Curtis and Mimi Sanderson, published by Whiting and Birch. </p> <p><strong> 'HIV has forced the issue' </strong> <br> Nick Partridge is chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust <br> Rupert Whittaker, Terrence Higgins's partner, was refused details of how Terry died by the hospital consultant, who told him if he wanted to find out, he could read about it in the next edition of the Lancet. At the start of the [Aids] epidemic in the 1980s, when people didn't fully understand it, and because the partners of lesbians and gay men were not treated as family, it could be an extremely difficult experience dealing with health and social services. </p> <p>The position now is wholly different and, while there are still issues of equality yet to be resolved, there is no doubt that a great many professionals in health and social services have worked very hard, and shown incredible commitment to making changes. </p> <p>And there have been huge changes over the past 20 years in particular. Before HIV it was in many ways more difficult to be open about sexuality, but one of the biggest changes is that HIV has forced the issue. </p> <p>The clear response of lesbians and gay men to the early reactions to the epidemic began to show homosexuality in a different light. It showed the complexity of people's lives and moved the focus away from exclusively sexuality. </p> <p>HIV meant that models of social care had to be changed. Changes were patchy at first in the 1980s, but there is no doubt that a large number of people in social care and health wanted to make a difference. </p> <p>It is worth remembering though, as far as working in health and social services goes, that even now, very many lesbians and gay men are still not able to come out. I think there remains a question about how deeply rooted equality is and how much of it is still a veneer. </p> <p>There are still risks attached to being fully out. I think there is still a level of acceptability about, for instance, using terms that are verbal homophobia that, were the equivalent for racism used, just would not be tolerated. It can be deeply hurtful and stressful for anyone involved. There's still a long way to go. </p> <p><strong> 'Kids can be cruel and use offensive language'</strong> <br> Rob Frank, teacher, East Anglia <br> There's no way I'd ever come out directly to the school kids, but from my second interview for my current job I made it clear to staff that I was gay, and I got the job regardless. It's funny because a lot of the sixth-form girls are speculating if I'm gay. They might come up and say something like: \"Sir, are you gay?\", and I'll have to respond with something vague like: \"Would it matter if I was?\" </p> <p>It can be difficult if students see you in the street. I went to a protest against hate lyrics the other day and an ex-student was there and started saying things like, \"That's fucking disgusting\", and verbally abusing me. </p> <p>I haven't experienced homophobia in the staff room, but schools can feel like a very homophobic environment. I think it must be very hard for teachers who are unsure of their sexuality. The kids can be cruel and use offensive language. I see it as my duty to talk to them about how they use language and how offensive it can be. </p> <p>When the sex education expert came in to the school recently, he talked only about heterosexual sex. When I asked him why he avoids discussions about gay sex, he said the schools don't like it. </p> <p>It's awkward sometimes not being able to talk openly about being gay, even though colleagues know. I would like to be seen as a positive gay role model. Kids need them, but I don't think it's possible yet. I volunteer at a youth group for young gay people up to the age of 25. Our youngest member is 12 and his mum brings him along. This is all very encouraging, and I want to put something back because I had a lot of support when I was coming out. </p> <p>I'd like to see a time when homosexuality is not an issue. When I told some colleagues that I was going to do this interview, one said: \"No. Don't. It will be social suicide. At the very least, don't give your second name.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Rob Frank is a pseudonym</p> <p><strong> 'They quizzed me about why I wasn't married'</strong> <br> Michael Lloyd, 65, is a retired probation officer <br> Being gay was an issue I had to face right away in my career. When I was being interviewed at the Home Office about being trained for the job, they quizzed me about why I wasn't married. From that time on, it always felt like it would be an issue. </p> <p>I came out in the late 1970s, partly because otherwise it would mean living with a lie. It also happened because a group of gay men and lesbians [in the service] had got together and were tired of homophobia within the criminal justice system. </p> <p>The probation service has changed in many ways over the years, but most of the progress has been because Lagip [Lesbians and Gays in Probation] have forced it. The service now formally recognises individual sexuality in its equality policies. </p> <p>However, even now there are cases where people suffer prejudice, such as abusive letters or bullying. I'm not saying it's rife, but it's there. Managers should be given better training to deal with the situation. </p> <p>In the 1970s, everyone was very positive and optimistic. We all thought we could change the world. Then came the 1980s, and we hadn't quite expected Thatcherism and the Tory party view that homosexuality should not be talked about in school. In the long run, though, it did us good. People rallied together against Section 28. If you're not optimistic about the future, you just give up. </p> <p><strong> 'Apart from with friends, I hid my orientation'</strong> <br>Ray Rowden is a health policy analyst <br> As a sexually confused 17-year-old student nurse in the early 1970s, I worked out quickly that if you slept with boys you kept it very quiet. The hospital I worked at was rabidly homophobic, so, apart from with a few trusted friends, I hid my orientation. I got married at 20 (I have two stunning daughters), thinking that my gay side would somehow go away. Needless to say, it didn't. I came out in the late 1970s, when I was working for the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in Wales. Reactions were mixed, but I remember meeting many gay and lesbian nurses, particularly in rural areas, who had terrible fears of being found out. </p> <p>At the RCN in the early 1980s, I quickly realised the upper echelons of British nursing were awash with gays and lesbians. One year, at the RCN conference in Blackpool, I took a mixed group of friends to a gay club. It was full of senior nurses and they were horrified that I had brought straight people. Their fear of being seen in a gay club was palpable. Many were in the closet, and some were married. </p> <p>In 1986, I became an NHS manager in Lambeth, south London. Diversity was positively valued at Lambeth, which was way ahead of its time. Despite that, I remember being phoned by a terrified male nurse who had been charged by the police for cottaging. His managers suspended him and were threatening disciplinary action, even before his court appearance. I intervened, insisting on his reinstatement. He was a brilliant nurse, but his fears for his career were very real. In the end, he was cleared by magistrates. </p> <p>It's easier for gay and lesbian public servants to live in London or Manchester. But are things so easy for colleagues in large towns and rural areas, and across the rest of the UK? I doubt it. </p> <p><strong> 'It's far more difficult in the private sector'</strong> <br> Helen Dale, 57, is acting IT project manager at the National Probation Service. <br> I spent 30-odd years working in advertising and PR and was living as a male heterosexual. I was married and have a grown-up daughter. I've been working in the public sector as a woman for the past five years and I really believe it's the best environment for a transgendered person. It's far more difficult in the private sector. </p> <p>There is a lot of unemployment among transgendered people and although as a group they are a lot more visible, there is still a lot more to be done in terms of wider acceptability. My job for the probation service was the first job I ever applied for as a woman. Although colleagues in previous jobs were aware that I was considering living and working as a woman, I had been working as a man. </p> <p>The interview for the probation service was a real non-event actually. I think they take their equality and diversity policies really seriously. I had a meeting with the man who was to be my line manager after I was offered the job. He said: \"Right, let's think about how we handle this. Tell me how you would like to handle it.\" </p> <p>It was impressive. A few days after getting the job, the equality and diversity officer came round to see me at my flat with the diversity manual. Greater Manchester Probation Service have been first class. I'm not saying they are perfect, but in my view they take things seriously. </p> <p><strong> 'I had to live with rumour and innuendo'</strong> <br>Vic Codling, 55, is a retired police constable.<br> For 20 years, I didn't tell anyone in the police force that I was gay. When I joined Durham Constabulary in 1971 it was apparent I'd get the sack if anyone found out. I had to live with rumour and innuendo. When I walked into a room, the conversation would change. </p> <p>Ten years later, my sergeant asked a chief officer to fail me on my advance driving course because I was a \"poof\". The chief officer told me what he'd said. He was disgusted by the sergeant's attitude and passed me with merit. The chief office never ask me if I was gay, but said he could raise the sergeant's behaviour as a disciplinary issue. I didn't take it any further because I had no confidence in management. At that time, it was OK to be homophobic. </p> <p>A year later, a PC I was very friendly with who knew I was gay - he was the first one I told - was pulled in by an inspector and chief inspector who said \"in the interests of your career, keep away from Vic Codling. You know he's a poof?\" Shortly after, the PC transferred back to the Metropolitan police. His sergeant down there was openly gay, so I decided to shift the 290 miles. That was in 1986. But I still didn't come out for another five years, until when I was at Hendon police college, delivering diversity training. </p> <p>Although the Gay Police Association has members from every force - 2,000 in total - there are still forces where are no openly gay police. The Police Federation of England and Wales uses the words racism and sexism, but instead of the word homophobia it uses \"bullying\" or \"harassment\". Yet Tayside police have just invited myself, an openly gay man, to tell HR managers how the organisation can become more inclusive for gay employees. Five years ago, that would never have happened.\" </p> <p><strong> 'I still can't show open affection in the street' </strong> <br> Eric Thomas, 45, a benefits officer at the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. <br> Recently, there was an incident with a client who came in to the benefits office where I work and he declared he \"didn't want the poof\" to deal with his case. I work in a very macho culture, but the whole team jumped to my defence. One colleague chal lenged the client and said if he didn't want to be dealt with by me then no one would be taking his case. </p> <p>On the whole, I get on with my colleagues, and if they overstep the mark with a joke I'll tell them. I feel secure at the council, though. It helps that, out of a staff of 61, there are four out gay men and three lesbians. </p> <p>London really is way ahead of the rest of the country. In Ipswich, where I worked before, being out wouldn't have been easy. I wouldn't have felt safe. There's a sense that you can still get your head kicked in for being gay in the provinces. </p> <p>I feel like I'm treated very well at Kensington and Chelsea. They have an old school \"conservative with a small c\" paternalistic attitude. </p> <p>The few years I spent at Westminster council, when I first came to London, were OK until the work I did was contracted out. Many things bothered me about the company. I went for an interview for promotion, and a colleague got the job (she deserved it; she was great) but when they explained to me why I hadn't, the interviewer said: \"Don't worry if you're thinking it had something to do with blonde hair and big tits, it didn't.\" That did it for me. </p> <p>Things are definitely better for lesbians and gay men than they were 20 or 30 years ago, but so much more needs to be done. I still can't walk in the street and show open affection for my partner without a fear of abuse. That's wrong. </p> <p><strong> 'Banter was about what they did to their wives'</strong> Stewart Brown is a firefighter in Glasgow <br> \"So, have you got something to tell us?\" That was the question that greeted me when I returned from holiday. It was asked in a lighthearted way. I realised then that while I'd been away they'd watched me on TV in the final of Mr Gay UK. They were shocked. Some were positive about it but some of the older guys didn't feel comfortable. My station officer couldn't handle it. He just ignored it; he didn't want to deal with it. </p> <p>Very soon the whole of Strathclyde found out I was gay. When I got sent to other stations, there was an atmosphere. I had to go through fear each time about how they would react. </p> <p>I've not suffered any real discrimination since I joined at the age of 19, but being gay has hampered my career. I was fearful of promotion because I would have to move stations and I wasn't strong enough to deal with people's attitudes. Some nights I'd feel very depressed. All the banter was about what they did to their wives the night before. I know of a lot of firefighters who have been on the brink of suicide or left because of harassment. </p> <p>Through a union rep, I found out about a support group being set up in 1994. We started telling our stories of being gay firefighters at equality seminars around the country for Fire Brigades Union members. In Northern Ireland, they asked if I had my own breathing apparatus, my own cutlery, my own bedding? Did I go to bed first? </p> <p>You're still not going to walk in to a station and say you're gay, but the culture is changing. We've got 250 firefighters on the support group's database. </p> <p>A large percentage of women who are joining the fire service are lesbian. In many ways, it's easier for them. They fancy women - they're one of the boys. </p> <p><strong> 'I feel much safer at work than out and about' </strong> <br> Dean Brewster, 35, is a community support worker in Rotherham <br> For three-quarters of my working life I was in the closet. For 10 years, I was married and I have three children, so it was extremely difficult coming out. It is also hard in Rotherham and south Yorkshire in general. There is no gay scene and there is still a lack of tolerance of gay people. </p> <p>I've worked for Rotherham social services for 17 years, starting as a residential care worker. It has been very hard at times. I've suffered from depression and had to take Prozac. It was so stressful: like wearing three different faces - one for work, one for home, one for when I went out. </p> <p>After I told my parents and family I was gay, I came out at work. I took the opportunity when I was moving jobs because it would be a new bunch of people. There are other gay people in social services who have not come out. People do things in their own time, but I'd like to be seen as a role model of a gay person at work who is happy with being out. </p> <p>Most councils are equal opportunities employers and gay people are now more protected than ever at work because of the new laws. But, even with this, some people are still homophobic. You can tell from the way they look and the way they talk. </p> <p>The council has been very good to me, but I still live with pressures and I've had a number of homophobic incidents near my home. I feel much safer in work than I do out and about. I feel more looked after. </p> <p><strong> 'We need to become accepted exceptions'</strong> <br> Marion Janner is director of Bright, a specialist charity that offers other charities help with public relations and communication.<br> My partner and I were part of the pioneering first wave of lesbian and gay foster carers and adopters. We fostered Eddie, a boy with learning difficulties for five years and still see him 18 years on. Given that a lot of gay and lesbian couples were looking after kids with learning difficulties or other special needs, some people were saying it was second-rate couples looking after second-rate kids, but I think that was just their own prejudices coming out. </p> <p>At the time, we were worried about being seen as \"contaminating\" or \"tainting\" him. Though I'm a feminist, we made sure he had traditional boys' toys. There was always that fear that we would be pilloried by the press as perverting children. Luckily, it didn't happen. Eddie's mother was initially concerned that he would be spending the weekend with a lesbian couple, but the social worker was brilliant, got us all to meet up, and as soon as we met and got to know each other it was fine. </p> <p>I came out 22 years ago when I was working for Community Service Volunteers. There wasn't a hint of hostility. There was anything from acceptance to total indifference, despite the fact that I was an angry, crop-haired dyke with radical lesbian politics. </p> <p>But society has to move from tolerance to indifference so that we are the same as everyone else. We need to become accepted exceptions. </p> <p><strong> 'GLF was so noisy it drowned out others'</strong> <br> Martin Stafford was a teacher and a member of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. He made a speech at a gay rally in Glasgow in 1973 in protest at radical gay activism. <br> The meeting was about whether homosexuals should integrate into society rather than fight against it. My argument was that we wanted greater recognition and integration. This was the time when the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was starting out. They believed that the prejudice against homosexuals was so great and deep-rooted that the only way to beat it was to overthrow capitalism, abolish marriage and end the concept of the family - very revolutionary and radical, but naive nonsense. </p> <p>The problem was the the GLF was so noisy and so radical that it drowned out the voice of others within CHE, and CHE itself seemed to tolerate this. I think the GLF's attitude dissuaded a lot of moderate people from coming out for fear of being branded as some sort of subversive anarchist. The GLF also gave so much ammunition to hardline opponents of any decriminalisation of homosexuality. </p> <p>The funny thing is that the things we campaigned for 30 years ago, acceptance and being able to have recognised relationships, are the things gay groups want now. They want to be able to marry - totally at odds with the sort of things the GLF was saying then.</p>",
  "A short stroll from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, past a brasserie where fresh Brittany belons are piled high to tempt in diners, lies the less flashy, but rather more prestigious, La Mar\u00e9e. <p>The Michelin-starred establishment is one of the best-loved seafood restaurants in the French capital. Reverent diners are served cuisine of the most exclusive, exquisite and traditional variety, on starched white linen and accompanied by frighteningly expensive wine. The luxurious atmosphere is perhaps appropriate, for American writer Eleanor Clark once observed, \"If you don't love life, you can't enjoy an oyster.\" </p> <p>You will not, however, find belons on the menu. The description of the very first dish at the top of the stiff white card on each table reads simply: \"Colchester les six.\" </p> <p>\"They're English oysters. And they're fabulous,\" says Fabrice Reggiano, La Mar\u00e9e's manager. \"Parisians love them. They ask us from the beginning of September when we are going to have them - we have to call up our suppliers to get them in as soon as possible. These are just wild. They're the super-oysters.\" </p> <p>For the French, it has been a long wait since May for the next month with an \"r\" in it and thus the start of the new season; native oysters cannot be harvested in summer, when they spawn. In Spain, Belgium, Hong Kong and Dubai, they have also been waiting anxiously for the first deliveries of their beloved Colchesters. </p> <p>And yet back in Britain, aside from fashionable oyster eateries such as Bibendum, seafood lovers are largely ignorant of their allure. In 2002 - the last year for which figures were available - we produced 1,171 tonnes of natives. Yet we promptly exported most of these, with natives accounting for a large proportion of the 910 tonnes of oysters sent overseas. </p> <p>\"We have the finest inshore shellfish in the world, but more than 80% of it is exported to mainland Europe,\" laments Peter Hunt, director of the Shellfish Association of Great Britain. \"Practically everything our holidaymakers say is so wonderful when they're in France actually comes from Britain - but they don't buy it fresh here.\" </p> <p>The indifference to Colchester natives is particularly galling for their fishermen. For these are the creme de la creme of the oyster world - a pearl of the British food industry, so to speak. </p> <p>Order \"an oyster\" in a restaurant and you will receive the farmed Pacific variety. Introduced to Britain in the 70s, these are easily identifiable by their cup-shaped shells, with coarser flesh and a less fishy, often more metallic taste than their cousins. </p> <p>Native oysters have a flat shell and finer, brinier flesh. But they are highly vulnerable to extremes of temperature, making them too unpredictable to cultivate and considerably more expensive. </p> <p>The best of all, say aficionados, are the succulent natives from a three-mile stretch of salt creek around the island of West Mersea, close to Colchester in Essex. Their flavour and texture is so distinctive that fishermen there are petitioning the European Union for protected geographical indication (PGI) status, which would recognise the molluscs as a high quality regional speciality comparable to champagne and Parma ham. </p> <p>The producers believe that the designation would not only prevent traders passing off lesser oysters as Colchesters, but also boost the delicacy's profile in Britain. </p> <p>It is not just a question of native pride, though Essex boy Jamie Oliver says that they are the best he has eaten. Reggiano extols their pleasures at some length: \"They have a lot of meat and the flavour is definitely better than a belon - it's saltier, tastier and laiteuse [milky],\" he enthuses. </p> <p>No one knows Colchesters better, however, than 59-year-old Richard Haward. On an impossibly bright September morning, with seagulls squabbling overhead, the oyster merchant steers us through the glassy creek. Withies - the tree branches marking out each fisherman's patch - poke from the waters where his friend David Gladwell has been out since early morning, dredging and sorting natives. </p> <p>Gladwell has been oyster fishing for 12 years: \"I was out picking oysters when other kids were doing paper-rounds,\" he says. </p> <p>The Hawards, by contrast, have been in the trade for seven generations. Richard's son Joe, 23, has just joined the business, while an account book from 1792 shows the success of his \"however many greats-grandfather\" at Billingsgate market in London. </p> <p>These days Haward trades in the more rarefied environment of London's Borough market, while his wife Heather presides over The Company Shed in West Mersea. With its oilcloth-covered tables and wooden benches, the tiny shack is a far cry from the carpeted hush of La Mar\u00e9e, but visitors who find their way there devour natives with equal relish. </p> <p>\"We want people to ask for a Colchester specifically, not just an oyster,\" Haward says, explaining how the clean, plankton-rich water of the creek produces the delicacy. </p> <p>\"They're brought from the Solent or the [Blackwater] river and are laid in trenches from about February. Then we start taking them up in September. They take their flavour from those last six months.\" </p> <p>Colchester natives have been the subject of continental fascination since Roman times; Pliny the Elder is said to have observed that oysters were the only good thing to come out of Britain. </p> <p>But their popularity has ebbed and flowed over the centuries, often in inverse relation to their abundance. By Dickens' time, they were common enough for his character Sam Weller to observe that \"poverty and oysters always seem to go together\". In the 19th century populations plummeted and since then their fragility has seen stocks almost wiped out by pollution or just bad weather. </p> <p>\"The worst time I saw was the big freeze in 1963,\" Haward recalls, describing how natives were first brought in from other areas to repopulate the waters. </p> <p>\"It was so cold that someone walked across the creek, and the ice settled on the oysters in the shallows, pressed them into the mud and suffocated them. They don't like very warm sum mers either, particularly in a creek like this. It's very shallow when the tide's out and gets hot so oxygen levels are low, weakening them.\" </p> <p>At the height of the season, Gladwell can pick up several hundred shells in a day; by its end, he may be lucky to find 70. </p> <p>The men say that the market price of oysters has barely increased in more than a decade, not even keeping pace with inflation. They refuse to elaborate, although an industry newsletter says that natives sold for around 50p per shell last year. (By the time they have reached the tables of La Mar\u00e9e, they cost around \u00a34 each). </p> <p>\"But the real problem is getting people to try them,\" says Haward. \"Ask people if they like them and half will say no. Ask if they've tried them - and most say no.\" </p> <p>Yet native oysters are truly a food for our time. Natural and unprocessed - unless one counts the 42 hours they spend in purification tanks - they are also low in fat and packed full of nutrients. </p> <p>Their unprepossessing exterior and alarming quiver may not help their case. Even Haward admits it took him years to appreciate the flavour. \"I was 10 when I had my first. I didn't like it, and didn't have another for about 30 years,\" he says. </p> <p>There is no such hesitation at La Mar\u00e9e, where conversation halts as gleaming platters arrive, les Colchesters resplendent on their little heaps of ice. They are served as plainly as can be - with half a lemon and thin slices of heavy brown bread - and look utterly magnificent. </p> <p>You tip your head back, let the oyster fall, take a bite - yes, a bite, say the experts - and swallow. The sensation is at once meaty and fresh, natural and luxurious: the best of all worlds. Perhaps the truth is that if you can't enjoy an oyster, you simply don't love life. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> La Mar\u00e9e is at 1, rue Daru, Paris, 75008 (+331-43802000).

  "Tony Blair showed some contrition yesterday when he stood before the Labour conference and offered a qualified apology for the Iraq war designed to reach out to voters enraged by the conflict. <p>In a marked change of tone, after taunting critics with a warning that they would have to \"eat their words\", the prime minister apologised for faulty intelligence on weapons of mass destruction but refused to express regret for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>As delegates listened in complete silence, the prime minister said he wanted to deal with Iraq \"head on\". Insisting that the \"whole international community\" had agreed Saddam possessed banned weapons in the run-up to war, Mr Blair then delivered his carefully phrased apology. </p> <p>\"The problem is I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam,\" he said. \"The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's words did not go any further than his recent remarks owning up to mistakes in Iraq. But one cabinet minister said yesterday's speech was designed to launch a \"conversation\" with opponents of the war by addressing in detail their anxieties. </p> <p>Declaring that he understood people's anger, Mr Blair said: \"At the heart of this is a belief that the basic judgment I have made since September 11, including on Iraq, is wrong, that by our actions we have made matters worse not better.\" </p> <p>He then asked: \"Do I know I'm right?\" A year after declaring to the US Congress that history would prove him right over Iraq, Mr Blair shied away from answering yes to his own question: \"Judgments aren't the same as facts. Instinct is not science. I'm like any other human being, as fallible and as capable of being wrong. I only know what I believe.\" </p> <p>But he insisted that action had to be taken against the \"new phenomenon\" of global terrorism as he dismissed critics who believed that al-Qaida would \"wither\" if not provoked. Indicating he had revised his view of Islamist terrorism, which he initially blamed on a lethal but minuscule minority, Mr Blair warned that al-Qaida and its associates held sway in substantial parts of the world. </p> <p>\"This is a wholly new phenomenon, worldwide global terrorism based on a perversion of the true, peaceful and honourable faith of Islam... Its roots are not superficial but deep, in the madrasas of Pakistan, in the extreme forms of Wahabi doctrine in Saudi Arabia, in the training camps of al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\" </p> <p>In remarks that came close to echoing Silvio Berlusconi's notorious warning of a clash of civilisations, Mr Blair declared that it was impossible to reason with such Islamists. \"They are not provoked by our actions but by our existence.\" </p> <p>But he pledged to champion the Middle East peace process after the US elections. For the third time in four annual conferences he talked of the need for progress towards peace. </p> <p>Mr Blair will return to the subject of Iraq today when he joins forces with Jack Straw to try to persuade the \"Big Four\" union leaders, who control 40% of the votes on the floor, to oppose a critical motion on the issue. Amid accusations of dirty tricks to prevent the conference debating a call for the \"early\" withdrawal of troops, the foreign secretary claimed it would be illegal to leave Iraq before December 2005. </p> <p>The critical composite is due to be moved tomorrow by the Regent's Park and Kensington local party in London. Earlier yesterday it was in danger of being blocked by the Labour leadership after a change of mind by the delegate from Walthamstow, north London, who agreed to second it. Anti-war campaigners said \"intolerable\" pressure had been put on the young delegate who was summoned to a meeting with Mr Straw. </p> <p>But last night it was clear the debate would go ahead, with No 10 not wanting to be accused of having the motion ruled out on a technicality. </p> <p>Three of the Big Four - Unison, T&amp;G and GMB - were holding firm last night over setting a date for early withdrawal but there were signs that Amicus was wavering. </p> <p>Derek Simpson, the Amicus general secretary, said: \"If the leadership is defeated the positive note of this conference may be lost on the war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not since Graeme Hick has an England debut been so pointedly awaited as that of Kevin Pietersen. That wait finally ended yesterday, with his call-up for the one-day series in Zimbabwe. Those not consumed by the politics may even have noticed. </p> <p>Pietersen, like Hick, is a southern African who has qualified for England by residence. He turned his back on South Africa because he resented the quota system - a post-apartheid attempt to quicken the sluggish progress of talented black players into the South Africa side - so it can be safely assumed that he is unlikely mistakenly to shake Robert Mugabe's hand in a darkened room. </p> <p>The 24-year-old is talented, no question: a devastating middle-order hitter whose off-spin, although it has not advanced as anticipated, may yet be retrievable. If that were to prove the case, he would be a redoubtable ally for Freddie Flintoff in England's middle order. He could move England closer to an XI capable of challengingfor the 2007 World Cup. </p> <p>But there has been a calculated side to his qualification that, even in a world where dual nationality has become commonly accepted, will cause some disquiet in an England dressing room more united than for many years. In his single-minded pursuit of Englishness to advance his career, there is a reminder of Andrew Caddick's single-minded switch of allegiance from New Zealand. </p> <p>Pietersen's first England call-up came a year ago with a place in the academy. He was one of the few successes on the academy tour of India, scoring four hundreds in as many matches, and has since suggested (accurately) that many of that squad had no chance of playing for England. </p> <p>But England's call did not cause an outburst of pride. He was abroad when selected and, receiving a phone call from a Nottingham paper, tactlessly responded that he was not about to waste his holiday by talking about England. He could have at least reminded everyone that, although he was born in Pietermaritzburg, his mother was born in Canterbury. </p> <p>His relationship with Nottinghamshire was strained at the time. He had been invited to Notts by Clive Rice, another South African, but when Rice's coaching stint ended, Pietersen became unsettled. The 2003 season ended with Nottinghamshire's captain Jason Gallian allegedly throwing his kit off the balcony. </p> <p>Pietersen, who wanted to break the final year of his contract to play First Division cricket, tried to claim unfair dismissal. The impasse dragged on all winter before he opted to stay another year. </p> <p>Rodney Marsh, head coach at the academy, remarked at the end of it all that Pietersen had recognised \"that you don't get everything the way you want it, but that is not to say you spit the dummy and go and sulk somewhere\". </p> <p>Pietersen has worked hard of late to improve his image. He told <em>All Out Cricket</em>, the magazine of the Professional Cricketers Association, this summer: \"My intentions have been clear from the start and I've followed them up - the reason being that I've been a follower of England for ages and I wanted to come and play in England. </p> <p>\"I just wanted to play cricket where you are selected on merit, where I could enjoy myself and not worry that even if I was performing I still might not be playing in the next fixture. It's a lot more difficult growing up as a white cricketer now in South Africa because of the politics and all that.\" </p> <p>Duncan Fletcher, England's coach, will study Pietersen's rapport with the dressing room in Zimbabwe as much as his performances on the field. The likelihood is that he will prove his worth. But the licence granted to strong-minded individuals comes with extra conditions now that Michael Vaughan has replaced Hussain Hussain as captain. Never mind David Morgan's talk yesterday about \"cricket's global family\", it is the England family which concerns Fletcher. </p> <p>Fletcher remarked before the Champions Trophy final last week: \"All my sides have had a good spirit. But sometimes it depends on luck - on the characters you have in the dressing room. You can try the same methods but if you have two or three individuals who don't fit in you struggle with team spirit. </p> <p>\"England's good run started when we realised the more that you work on the field the more it will bear fruit off it. We forced the team into the gym together and they had to get on with it. When you pick people you have to have the luck that they will mix and get on with each other.\" </p> <p>Pietersen, who averages 54 in first-class cricket, 41 in one-day games, is clearly a stronger batting selection than Anthony McGrath, who spent much of the past year as towel monitor and whose international days may be over. But the Nottinghamshire batsman has not been chosen for the much tougher one-day series in South Africa, when the likes of Flintoff return. It is a suitable reminder that, as talented as he is, he still has a lot to prove.</p>",
  "Monday saw Gordon Brown deliver one of his most passionate Labour party conference speeches, the papers agreed. It was a \"barnstorming\" performance by a man \"at the peak of his political powers\", reckoned the <b>Daily Mail</b>. The chancellor \"showed himself to be totally in command of national, European and global economic issues\". <p>For many, including the <b>Scotsman</b>, the speech \"laid out a precise Brownite agenda for a possible third Labour term ... Mr Brown's leitmotif was something called a 'progressive consensus', which he pledged to create,\" said the paper. \"This consensus would embrace an efficient economy, American-style, but also a progressive welfare system, European-style.\" </p> <p>The chancellor's version of a \"global Third Way\" would be very \"attractive\" to many in the Labour party, said the <b>Times</b>. Yet the vision \"outlined in his speech seemed to stop with the ideal, both at home and abroad, of services paid for and provided by the government. We live in an extraordinarily dynamic era, but, the chancellor indicated, the new Jerusalem is much the same as it was some five decades ago.\" </p> <p>The <b>Daily Telegraph</b> took a similar view. Mr Brown's political consensus would prove neither progressive nor existing by consensus, it warned. \"It is rather a reactionary and divisive prospectus, in which the middle classes are squeezed in the name of egalitarian ideals, and the economy with them.\" </p> <p>But the <b>Daily Mirror</b>'s Paul Routledge - long an admirer of the chancellor - was enthralled by the speech. Mr Brown had captured the \"philosophical high ground\" within the Labour party. Routledge compared the chancellor's vision to \"putting old wine in new bottles with a vengeance\". </p> <p>The speech was a call on Labour to reject \"all the Blairite talk of radical reform of public services and privatisation\", said the <b>Independent</b>. It noted that Mr Brown's speech contained long passages about the \"central importance\" of his economic management to both the government's record and its chances of further electoral success. \"Subtext: you owe your success so far to me and I am not going to be sidelined in the next general election.\"</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Are all the half-decent former diplomats trapped under something heavy? We only ask as Sir David Gore-Booth, the chap drafted on to the Today programme yesterday to defend Jack Straw's unfortunate handshake with Robert Mugabe at the UN played an absolute blinder, explaining of the confusion: \"There's a lot of people [at the UN], and quite a lot of them are black. It's quite difficult to sort them out.\" Yeeees... Oddly, the interview was terminated shortly after that, but the Diary's Simon Goodley calls to congratulate David, and to check he concurs with other popular views of black people, such as their tactical naivety in football, and their timeworn failure to fancy it on a wet Wednesday in January away to Charlton. Slightly unusually, he's only able to get hold of his mother (David is 61), who informs him that the former ambassador to Saudi Arabia is \"probably sleeping as he's not feeling well\". Yes, we heard the interview. Anyway, we're rather nervous of pressing the point in a household clearly modelled on Sorry!, the somewhat disturbing 80s Ronnie Corbett sitcom, so we say goodbye before Mother Gore-Davis can shout \"Language, Timothy!\" at us. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Meanwhile, the hunting debate remains the most elevating exchange of views in British politics, with yesterday in Brighton its glorious fulcrum. On the one hand, pro-hunt campaigners made some still obscure intellectual point by dumping four animal carcasses in Brighton city centre. And on the other, conference organisers banned the League Against Cruel Sports from selling their fox glove puppets, apparently out of concern that delegates might have waved them too excitedly during Blair's speech. Such class!</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> By the way, if anyone's wondering where the real debate's taking place, it appears to be on Five's reality TV show, The Farm. The programme's first night yielded a heated discussion between the various celebrity contestants about racism. The second featured a debate over the Iraq hostage crisis, which resulted in diminutive magician Paul Daniels squaring up to the profoundly imbecilic former US rapper, Vanilla Ice. Paul Daniels has now left the show. Anyway, if you're inspired by the fact these arguments are being rehearsed on reality TV - by the former Every Second Counts presenter and a man once spotted reading Smash Hits with his finger - while Brighton rocks to the sound of glove puppets fighting it out with animal corpses, why not give the Diary a call? We want to hear from you.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Now this really is today's last word on the subject of puppets, but we have an update on Let My Puppets Come, the marionette-staffed hardcore movie which is thus far the standout entry in the Diary's search for the best adult movie title of all time. Our promised review of this work is postponed, as the tape we were due to watch at the weekend vanished. A new one has been ordered, but in the meantime, did we mention it's also a musical? Honestly.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A delight to find Elliot Morley in fine form at a meeting at Brighton's Albion Hotel yesterday, promoting crops which can be put to innovative uses. \"Take hemp,\" enthused the environment minister. \"Car dashboards are now being made from it. And it has the additional benefit that when you scrap the car... you can smoke it.\" Well. The whole reason we shunned conference this year was because we heard organisers still frowned on mind-bending drugs (we couldn't honestly be expected to face the event without them) so Elliot's blessing comes as a welcome surprise.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Finally, there will be no comment on the PM's speech, as we found ourselves straying into dangerously tasteless territory the moment the collapsed Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, told paramedics that he'd started to feel \"queasy\" during it.</p>"
