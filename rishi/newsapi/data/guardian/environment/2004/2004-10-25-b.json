  "<p>Cash is cash. Until yesterday, that was the reason why, despite effigies at the Stretford End and mixed signals from the Irish shareholders, Malcolm Glazer looked as if he would emerge eventually as the new owner of Manchester United. </p> <p>Glazer was willing to pay more than anybody else for the company's shares and, in JP Morgan, seemed to have had found a bank that would lend him the cash to do so. Of course, Glazer's mega-loan would have come at a price - such as using prime assets, maybe even Old Trafford itself, as security. But such leveraged deals happen in the City all the time. When Philip Green was trying to buy Marks &amp; Spencer, shareholders did not bleat about the morality of the use of heavy borrowings; they just wanted to know if Green and his bankers were good for the readies. </p> <p>Glazer was proceeding on the same principle. He might be borrowing up to his eyeballs but, he assumed, that would be his look-out. All the United shareholders had to worry about was whether they liked the look of 300p a share. </p> <p>But they do things differently at Manchester United. The board's advisers, the City law firm Freshfields, provided the legal support yesterday for the rejection of Glazer, pointing out that directors' direct responsibilities are actually to the company, not its shareholders (for the aficionados, Dawson International versus Coats Paton, 1989, is a precedent). So if Glazer and his debts are bad for United the company, there's no deal; the Buccaneer from Tampa can go away and think again. </p> <p>The bad news for United fans' groups is that he probably will. When Glazer was rebuffed by the Irish, he responded with an aggressive share-buying operation to take his stake to 28.1%. It was a loud and clear statement. </p> <p>From Glazer's point of view, the most damaging aspect of rejection by the board is the effect on his financing. It has been said in the past week that JP Morgan never backs a bid without board recommendation. But that is not quite true. What the bank never does is advance a \u00a3400m loan without a thorough look at the books of the target company - the process is known in the City as due diligence. </p> <p>So Glazer's strategy now will be to find a way of forcing the United's board to allow him to conduct due diligence. There is a mechanism: as a major shareholder with 28.1% of the shares, he can requisition a extraordinary general meeting and force the matter to a vote. He would win, of course, if the Irish shareholders, with their 28.9% stake, voted with him. </p> <p>And why would JP McManus and John Magnier do so? Well, it is possible that they disagree with the position the United board took yesterday. There was no clear view from Dublin yesterday, beyond a wry observation that we are now in \"uncharted waters\", but look at their way: their investment in United has just fallen in value. The Irish did not grab at Glazer's initial approaches, which came with lots of strings attached, but his revised offer might have been better. </p> <p>In other words, do not assume this saga is over. Glazer can make life very awkward for the United board. Cubic Expression, with its infamous 99 questions on corporate governance, demonstrated that it is very hard for the board of a public company to ignore the views of a shareholder controlling almost 30% of the stock. </p> <p>In some ways, yesterday's statement by the board did not alter the wider picture: everything changes if Glazer and the Irish ever reach a deal. For as long as the possibility is there, speculation about a bid for United will not go away. </p> <p>That is probably why their chief executive David Gill yesterday also made an appeal for a \"long-term solution\" to United's ownership structure. He was heroically short on actual ideas, but he is correct that the current position is absurd. No other public company has to endure such an atmosphere of constant siege. </p> <p>Yet is is hard to see how the situation can change without Glazer relinquishing his ambition to gain control. He has enough stock to block most proposals, and he gives the impression of being sufficiently bloody-minded to dig in for a long haul. It does not mean he will win, but we could still be talking about bids and Buccaneers this time next year.</p>",
  "Back in February, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, did one of those things that help to mark him as one of the most interesting politicians of our age and continent. En route from Berlin for talks in Moscow with Vladimir Putin, Fischer stopped off for the first time in his life in the Baltic city that was once K\u00f6nigsberg and is for now Kaliningrad. He did so to mark the 200th anniversary of the death of the city's most famous son, laying a wreath and delivering an oration at the grave of Immanuel Kant. <p>Clutching his dog-eared copy of The Critique of Pure Reason, Fischer told his audience of diplomats and philosophers how Kant, along with Hegel and Marx, remained one of his own greatest influences. An understanding of law and morality as the basis of the rational world was Kant's continuing legacy to the present, he argued. Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, which envisages a global association of republics, could even be seen as a pointer towards the creation of the UN, Fischer suggested. </p> <p>It is impossible to imagine many circumstances in which one of Britain's past or current ministers would reflect on the continuing influence and relevance of one our own great philosophers. Jack Straw, Fischer's opposite number, is a serious thinker, but he will not be taking a leaf out of the German foreign minister's book on Thursday to deliver a graveside tribute on the 300th anniversary of the death of John Locke. </p> <p>Very few people appear to make the pilgrimage to Locke's last resting place in a tomb against the church wall at High Laver in west Essex. When I went to pay my respects there last weekend, I had the church and his memorial to myself. No one had signed the visitors' book for nearly two weeks. Locke's significance as a guiding spirit of the US constitution is duly marked by a church plaque erected by American admirers in 1957. But his importance in his own country is not acknowledged in any way. This neglect seems somehow bleakly appropriate of our current uncertainties. </p> <p>Locke certainly has his faults, and his critics, and it is important not to romanticise him. There is confusion, self-contradiction and much that is unresolved in his thinking. He was a man of the 17th century, and his advocacy of tolerance did not extend to Catholics or to atheists. His civil society of free, equal and rational men essentially excluded women and the labouring poor. Yet you do not have to be an enthusiast for Locke to recognise the sheer scale of his contribution to British life or his central position at the fountainhead of so much that came later. </p> <p>Indeed, it is hard to think of anything important about societies in general, and our own in particular, on which Locke did not have something pertinent and lasting to say. He is the essential philosopher of consensual constitutional government, the key expounder of the notions of the social contract, the sovereignty of the people, majority rule, minority rights and the separation of powers. He is our leading defender of individual civil liberty, the greatest advocate in our history of religious and civic tolerance, and the first proponent of progressive educational methods, as well as the principal godfather of all those attitudes of common sense, reasonableness, kindness and politeness that later eras have so often thought of as essentially British. </p> <p>So if anyone deserves to be the object of serious civic commemoration or reflection in Britain, then Locke surely qualifies. Yet this week's notable anniversary will pass here almost without notice. Elsewhere the interest is somewhat greater. Locke is generally taken more seriously in America, where a crude Lockean view of the contract between the individual (sovereign) and government (limited) remains widely held. Yet he has become a prophet without much honour in his homeland, even though he is the principal intellectual begetter of the 1688 constitutional settlement, which he did so much to legitimate and which has lasted from his day to ours. </p> <p>I am not arguing for large-scale celebrations, renaming of streets, a special issue of postage stamps or even an anniversary lecture by Simon Schama on the BBC, although none of these would be unwelcome. But it seems more than a mere oversight that we do not even consider doing any of these things. There are, of course, special reasons why Germans should wish to recall and connect with Kant. But other European countries also have explicit places and rituals of honour for their own great thinkers and writers. Britain is unusually negligent in this respect, especially considering our riches and our strong, if conflicted, sense of national identity. So one has to wonder: why? </p> <p>The big answer is surely that we gradually lost sight of the liberalism of which Locke has such a large claim to be the source. And lost confidence in it too. A hundred years ago, Locke's position at the head of a still vibrant British liberal tradition seemed utterly secure. Since then, the liberal tradition has declined, faltered, and has even seemed to have spent itself. For much of the 20th century, socialism appeared to be the philosophy and programme of the future, a stronger weapon to achieve wider social justice. In those circumstances, Locke inevitably appeared a more distant and less relevant figure. More radical and obscure 17th-century icons, like the Digger Gerrard Winstanley and the Leveller Thomas Rainborough, seemed to have more to say to our times. </p> <p>But socialism has failed. Even the era of the labour movement is passing inexorably away. We inhabit a world that has passed through the industrial socialist era and is emerging on the other side of it, dazed, disorientated and in search of new and more relevant signposts towards modern social justice and liberty. Capitalism has won the economic battle, albeit in a form that no 19th-century capitalist would easily recognise. Socialism has become a religion not a programme. And liberalism, which to socialists seemed for so long to be merely temporising and cowardly, has outlasted socialism. </p> <p>Which is why, in turn, it is time to return to Locke and the tradition at whose head he still stands. Liberalism without social justice is not a political programme in the democratic age. But nor, we should have learned from the 20th-century experience, is social justice without liberalism. The things that Locke thought were important - government by consent, the parliamentary system, civil liberty, freedom of thought and religion, the rights of minorities, an education that is more than functional, the rule of law - have never seemed more modern than they do today. Disregard for these principles has marked every instance of the failed socialist experiment. And it is also perhaps the most lasting - and least excusable - of all New Labour's failings too. To the politics of the future, as of so much else, Locke still holds the key. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.kettle@theguardian.com\">m.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "There can be few jobs in the United States Secret Service as cushy as being one of Jimmy Carter's bodyguards. You get to wear the cool earpiece, and ride in the blacked-out SUV, but, seriously, who's going to want to attack the most decent man to have occupied the White House in living memory? Wherever they go, George Bush, John Kerry and Bill Clinton are surrounded by burly, paranoid-looking men, ready to wrestle you to the ground if you breathe at them wrongly. But on a crisp autumn day at the Carter Centre, a human-rights institute sprawled over 35 leafy acres in Atlanta, Carter's security detail are relaxing near one of the entrances, trading jokes, while their 80-year-old charge works unmonitored within. Nearby, the young researchers showing up for work in jeans exude the happy calm of people whose jobs mesh well with their consciences. As they pass in the pink-walled lobby, they pause, make eye contact, and wish you good morning like they really mean it. All of which makes the question of how to address Carter slightly fraught. The standard practice (though not, I later learn, the official etiquette) is to call all former presidents \"Mr President\". But somewhere this informal, can that really be appropriate? <p>Actually, yes. The 39th president of the United States, in shirtsleeves and loafers today, is a man forever caught between niceness and grandeur. One of the two condescending cliches about him is that he was too nice for the White House, and perhaps in defiance, his manner remains somewhat imperious. With its gold-fringed American flag and massive, intricately carved desk, his private workplace seems like a replica Oval Office; the rumour used to be that his laptop still played Hail To The Chief when it was booted up. His use of the first-person plural, meanwhile, can sound decidedly royal. \"What we did, in our time, was to keep the country at peace,\" he will say later, in honeyed vowels that combine a lifetime in the political aristocracy with his origins as a Georgia peanut farmer. \"We had a very good actual record.\" </p> <p>But the grandeur vanishes, replaced by beaming smiles, whenever he talks about The Hornet's Nest, the book that recently made him the first former president to publish a novel. \"Are you familiar with Patrick O'Brian?\" he asks with excitement, explaining part of the inspiration for his densely researched tale of the American war of independence. I confess that I haven't read my way through O'Brian's long list of cult seafaring tales. \"I have,\" he responds. \"I've read all the way through them, and I'm reading them for a second time now.\" </p> <p>The other Carter cliche is that he is the best former president America has ever had. The fading popular memory of his administration is still dominated by the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran, in which 66 Americans were kidnapped, 52 of them held for months, and eight US servicemen were killed in a botched rescue mission. The Carter \"post-presidency\", by contrast, has been a marathon of valuable diplomacy in North Korea, the Middle East, Haiti and Cuba, of election-monitoring and Nobel Peace prize-winning. The Carter Centre, besides its conflict resolution work, has helped nearly eliminate several major world diseases. More recently, Carter has broken with ex-presidential etiquette by attacking Bush and Tony Blair for invading Iraq on the basis of \"lies or misinterpretations\", and savaged Jeb Bush over the potential for a new election fiasco in Florida. In his spare time, he paints. He makes furniture in his workshop in Plains, the Georgia village where he was born in the era of segregation. He studies Native American history. He writes poems. He is, depending on whom you believe, either an exuberant polymath, or a man still flailing to find a secure historical legacy. </p> <p>If it's the latter, I'm not sure The Hornet's Nest is going to help much. At 465 pages, the detail-laden story of Pratt, a Philadelphian lured to the South to fight for the American cause, is something of a slog, leavened mainly by its unintentionally funny sex scenes. (\"He was overwhelmed with a feeling of tenderness,\" one already much-mocked passage runs, \"and was also aroused sexually, which his tight trousers made obvious to both of them.\") </p> <p>Still, one neglected truth about the revolutionary war, deeply ironic today, jumps out from the novel: America owes its independence to the French. \"I never dreamed that by the time the book went into print, America would be refusing to eat so-called french fries, and things of that category,\" Carter says. \"Quite a ridiculous development. We could never have won the revolutionary war had it not been for the French.\" He smiles. \"Although the French didn't do it out of altruism, or love of America. They did it out of hatred for Great Britain.\" </p> <p>The more Carter talks, the more he gently lectures on the lessons of history and the dangers of the present moment, the more difficult it becomes to accept the idea that he was too nice for the presidency. Now that we know what happens when macho posturing replaces niceness at the White House, Carter's decency - his quiet moralism, his intense but low-key religiosity, his rock-solid marriage to his wife Rosalynn - all come to seem less like unaffordable indulgences and more like urgent necessities. (When it comes to toughness, in any case, there is style and there is substance: Carter, on taking office, had spent more years in the military than any 20th-century president except Eisenhower.) </p> <p>So why does he think the US electorate punished him so badly over Iran - a crisis that wasn't his choice, and in which relatively few Americans died - while the polls are so split about Bush's arguably far worse, and certainly more deadly, adventure in Iraq? </p> <p>\"I think the basic reason is that our country suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Carter says. \"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>The bitter truth seems to be that the Iranian debacle was received so badly precisely because Carter had proven so successful, in other respects, at keeping the peace - whereas now, there's a war on. \"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions. The press have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved.\" </p> <p>Another hazard of being a former president, it seems, is that you feel the force of your successors' policy reversals with all the acuteness of personal slights. \"All of those long, tedious negotiations that were done by Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Nixon and me and Reagan, to control the spread of nuclear weapons have been abandoned by Bush,\" he sighs. Carter praises Kerry for \"bringing out the fallacies of Bush's foreign policy\", but warns that he must \"show consistency in his positions, and that he's a strong leader. That's the only advice I'd give.\" </p> <p>Carter rejects the worst criticism that could be made of his administration: that his alleged softness in the face of Islamist terrorism helped nourish the threat that culminated in today's al-Qaida. \"I don't think that's an accurate assessment. \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p> Still, it must be tough, having held the most powerful position in the world, to have so many people continue to believe that everything you've done since has been more impressive. Does the \"best former president\" line irritate him? \"Maybe it did at the beginning. But I don't have any doubt that my post-presidency has made some historians go back and look at the administration with a more benevolent and approving attitude. We promoted human rights, we promoted freedom, we promoted peace between others - peace between Israel and Egypt,\" in the Camp David accords. \"I feel quite at ease about the presidential record, and also the post-presidential. But I like to do different things. Last April, I began to paint...\" And he is smiling again, plunging back into the details of his richly varied life. </p> <p>Perhaps it is no wonder that Carter is still most aglow when he speaks of Plains, where he will sometimes rise at five, in the morning stillness, and write for five or six hours at a time. \"And then, when I'm tired of my computer screen, I usually go to my farmland to visit my crops, or to my woodlands, or I build another piece of furniture, or paint a picture. It's a very wonderful opportunity I have. Almost complete isolation.\" </p> <p>But he is a long way from retiring there permanently yet. \"I've got to go,\" he says suddenly. \"I have to go to Grenada.\" He jumps from his seat and vanishes to a private room behind his office. The interview is over and, as you leave, you find, to your surprise, that you've caught a bit of his glow - that you feel genuinely hopeful for hurricane-torn Grenada, and nostalgic for the days when the worst that could be said about a president's character was that he made himself look silly when he admitted to feeling lust in his heart for women who weren't his wife. </p> <p>Meanwhile, outside in the cool air, the happiest Secret Service operatives in all of America are bouncing on their feet to keep warm. Their conversation is beginning to drift towards wondering when Carter will be ready to be driven to the airport. But it would be wrong to suggest that they seem particularly worried about performing this crucial bit of bodyguarding. </p> <p>\"Shall we go find him?\" one of them asks. </p> <p>His colleague performs an exaggeratedly nonchalant shrug. \"He knows where the van is.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Hornet's Nest by Jimmy Carter is published by Simon &amp; Schushter at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>With a week to go before the election, the sounds of silence about the main cause of economic instability are deafening. Perhaps that is because for 17 years there has been one gatekeeper of US economic policy: Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan - reinstated for a fifth term partly because he's the most vocal cheerleader of Bush's plans to cut taxes for the rich, mortgage the federal budget and privatise social security. </p> <p>Since his appointment in 1987, Greenspan has glided over an epic savings and loans crisis and merely levied a token 25-basis point rate rise to curtail the runaway stock market of the 90s. As the market came crashing down, he cut rates 11 times, enabling ever-larger banks access to even cheaper money to pump into corporate America. Greenspan's reaction to fraud fallout and bank misconduct was to bless more mega-mergers. </p> <p>After the bank-inspired corporate implosions came finger pointing, job cutting, and benefit slashing. Inculpability ran rampant - in the boardroom, on Wall Street and in Washington. It was \"the economy\" that hurt the economy, not the corporate debt overhang, cooked books, faux stock market or loose policy. </p> <p>Criticism of conflicts of interest on Wall Street never came from the Fed, nor the Bush administration, the SEC, Congress, or even John Kerry, former member of the Senate banking committee. It came from Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York. </p> <p>The finance, insurance and real estate sector pays well to be so overlooked. It poured $775m into political pockets over the past three election cycles: 59% to the Republicans, 41% to the Democrats. My former employer, Goldman Sachs, outdid itself this election, leading corporate American campaign donations with $4.8m. </p> <p>During the third presidential debate, Bush cooed: \"We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet ... this economy is growing.\" He says he has created 1.9 million jobs. Kerry says he has lost more than any president since Herbert Hoover. Neither candidate broached the connection between job losses and the deregulated corporate environment. Yet US firms produced more bankruptcies over the past few years than in any other period in US history. They created the widest wage gap between the average worker and average Fortune 500 chief executive. They cut jobs and pension plans to compensate. </p> <p>In 1929, America experienced a market crash followed by years of depression in which 25% of the population lost jobs. It was caused by wild speculation, availability of cheap money, and deception. The Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 separated bank functions in order to avoid conflicts of interest. It fostered stability for decades. </p> <p>It has been ripped apart by Greenspan, bipartisan Congresses, Robert Rubin, Clinton's treasury secretary, and now Citigroup's vice-chairman, and by regulatory neglect. The bigger financial institutions become, the greater the competition among them and the more incentive to fabricate value. On this impending crisis, Bush is a lost cause, Kerry a disappointment and Greenspan the biggest economic danger no matter who wins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nomi Prins wrote Other People's Money: The Corporate Mugging of America (The New Press) released in UK this week</p>",
  "<p>The faces have changed at Elland Road but the flights of fancy remain. Immediately after a Leeds performance as dismal as the weather, the club's finance director Melvin Helme breezily told supporters that a large cash injection was imminent and promotion was still on the cards. </p> <p>\"I have a dream for Leeds United,\" he began, eerily echoing Peter Ridsdale, before revealing that the club was in the \"advance stages of negotiations\" with various potential investors. </p> <p>\"We don't need much to get out of the Championship,\" he added, warming to his theme. \"Just enough for two or three players. The real problems will come if we get promoted - hopefully next May. We would not want to be a yo-yo club.\" </p> <p>On Saturday's evidence, however, Leeds should be looking down, not up, after slipping to 17th following a turgid display that lacked creativity or cutting edge. Admittedly the visitors were not helped by the various eccentricities of the referee Richard Beeby, who set his stall out early by booking Gary Kelly for a foul committed by Clarke Carlisle, and ended the game by dismissing Matthew Kilgallon and Paul Butler, much to their dismay. </p> <p>\"I made the tackle for which I got my second booking and the lineswoman waved played on,\" Kilgallon said. \"But, when the referee came over, she went quiet. I said to her: 'Just say something.' But she was having none of it.\" </p> <p>Butler was sent off as Brighton time-wasted in the corner during injury-time. \"First I was booked for saying 'it's a man's game', then I was given a straight red for telling the referee that a free-kick he gave was a joke\" he said. </p> <p>\"The ref says he sent me off for foul and abusive language, but that's an absolute lie. I've got witnesses who say he's lying. As the club captain I tried talking to him early on but he said 'shut up or I'll book you'.\" </p> <p>Leeds have seen a few cards this season and not all of them can have been cheap. \"The directors aren't too enamoured with the number of bookings we picked up,\" Helme admitted. \"We'll be having a word with Kevin [Blackwell] and the team.\" </p> <p>The flurry of cards - seven yellow, two red - at least provided a talking point after a game in which both teams battled the elements and lost, although Brighton just about deserved their win, which was set up when Darren Currie's free-kick was shinned into his own net by Carlisle. </p> <p>Leeds responded by upping the tempo but they lost momentum - and their composure - when the ballboys were cunningly removed 10 minutes from time, leading to long delays whenever the ball was booted out. </p> <p>Not that Blackwell was complaining. \"We were rubbish,\" he said. \"I don't have strikers with enough wisdom, knowledge or guile. Please God, I will be able to bring in the players I need.\" A move for the Preston and Northern Ireland forward David Healy, long mooted, cannot come soon enough. </p> <p>Too good to go down? Probably. But they said that last year too. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Darren Currie (Brighton)</p>",
  "George Bush has exploited the suffering of September 11 and turned back decades of efforts to make the world a safer place, the former president Jimmy Carter says in an interview with the Guardian published today. <p>Attacking Mr Bush and Tony Blair over Iraq, Mr Carter calls the war \"a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements\". </p> <p>He also criticises Mr Bush for \"lack of effort\" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and accuses him of abandoning nuclear non-proliferation initiatives championed by five presidents. </p> <p>The US \"suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Mr Carter says. </p> <p>\"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>Mr Carter, 80, was president from 1977-1981, but did not win re-election amid the US hostage crisis in Iran. By comparison, support for Mr Bush's Iraq invasion is widespread, something Mr Carter attributes to a transformation in America's national mood. </p> <p>\"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Blair are blamed for helping to fuel the depth of anti-American feeling in the Islamic world. Denying any link between his handling of the Iranian crisis and the present threat, Mr Carter says: \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p>American media organisations, he adds, \"have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved\". </p> <p>On nuclear proliferation, the issue that the Democratic contender John Kerry has identified as the single most serious threat to national security, Mr Carter attacks Mr Bush for abandoning \"all of those long, tedious negotiations\" carried out by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan and himself. </p> <p>In recent weeks he has also warned of the possibility of a new election fiasco in Florida. </p> <p>The two presidential candidates spent the weekend focusing their resources and words even more tightly on the small number of swing states considered crucial to the election on November 2. </p> <p>Mr Bush told supporters in Florida that \"despite ongoing violence, Iraq has an interim government. It's building up its own security forces. We're headed toward elections in January. You see, we're safer, America is safer with Afghanistan and Iraq on the road to democracy. We can be proud that 50 million citizens of those countries now live as free men and women\". </p> <p>Mr Carter's interview marks the UK publication of his book The Hornet's Nest, a story of the American revolutionary war and the first novel to be published by a former president. Ironically, he notes, those fighting for US independence could never have triumphed were it not for an alliance with the French.</p>",
  "<p>We all want to be looked after when we're sick and old, so a four-year, \u00a316bn programme of building or rebuilding 83 hospitals ought to be a natural vote-winner, the architectural equivalent of kissing babies. Yet the government's flagship project in this bonanza, the new Royal London Hospital, is running into serious trouble less than a year since its design was first proposed. To make matters worse, it is looking likely that many others will follow. </p> <p>The proposed plans for the \u00a3600m Royal London, commissioned from HOK International architects, are clearly disastrous. In July, the government's building design watchdog, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, described it as \"cramped\", \"confusing\" and \"seriously flawed\". </p> <p>The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, has threatened to block it and planners at the London Borough of Tower Hamlets who are still considering the proposals admit that a scheme for an office block with a comparable design would be refused planning consent. If we want fresh air, light and views of sky and trees as we lie in our sick-beds, it is clear that this type of hospital, with its rows of dingy consulting rooms, will not fit the bill. </p> <p>A few miles across London, however, the form of another hospital, newly commissioned and also financed by the NHS, tells a different story. The terracotta-clad Evelina Children's Hospital at Guy's and St Thomas doesn't open until early next year, but it is already an architectural success. A soaring glazed atrium and floor-to-ceiling windows will bathe children, doctors and nurses in light; ward corridors are snaked to eliminate patients' fear of endless echoing passages. From the outside, the building's form and colour emanate warmth and confidence rather than uncertainty and stress. </p> <p>Why are the results of these two commissions so different? The answer lies in the financing. The Royal London is being funded through PFI, a convoluted process in which private companies build public buildings and then lease them back to the state. Practically every penny spent on the new hospital building programme will be channeled through this system. Once the brief has been agreed, the private sector finances, builds and then maintains the building for 30 years. Imagination and vision are often exchanged for architecture that is cheap to build and maintain. </p> <p>The Royal London plans were forged under such circumstances. Its three giant glass boxes, rising to 18 storeys, are sited in a crowded part of the city and make scant reference to the style of the surroundings, which now include Norman Foster's soaring Swiss Re tower. It is, Cabe concludes, \"jumbled and ad hoc\". </p> <p>The internal layout threatens to confuse patients and staff. Many rooms lack windows. The architect's plans paint a picture of healthcare as an industrial process, and the never-ending departments of a modern hospital are shoe-horned on to a cramped site. But it would be wrong to lay the blame for the design at HOK's door: HOK is also the architect of the celebrated Northwestern Memorial hospital in Chicago. </p> <p>Some senior consultants are deeply frustrated at the government's adherence to PFI. The neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, who last year moved from the Victorian hospital of Atkinson Morley's in Wimbledon to a new PFI-funded wing at St George's in Tooting, is one. Marsh can't see out of his office window without standing on a sofa and says he has to dash down two floors to handle emergencies in his operating theatre. It means he spends more time in the theatre than necessary. </p> <p>\"These buildings are hugely profitable [for private consortiums] so it is not unreasonable to expect a pretty perfect hospital,\" he says. \"One of the big problems is that the PFI company gets a fixed fee irrespective of how badly the building works in terms of absenteeism or wound infection. Both staff and patients need to feel they are part of a caring community rather than part of an office or factory. It is very worrying.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, doctors and nurses are flocking to work at the Evelina Children's Hospital, which was designed and built using a more conventional route than PFI. </p> <p>After a design competition, the hospital hired architect Michael Hopkins &amp; Partners directly with its own money rather than choosing a PFI consortium. It was the practice's first hospital after creating such landmarks as Portcullis House in Westminster. As the Evelina building began to emerge, vacancies for nurses in the paediatric intensive care unit fell from 30% to 2% and applications for consultants' posts doubled. </p> <p>The 100,000 children who will be cared for there each year are in for a treat. The trust asked children what they wanted - not too many private rooms, no scary long corridors - and gave the architect the latitude to produce light and airy spaces. There will be pull-down beds for parents. Young patients who are too sick to leave their wards can look down through fully glazed walls to the winter garden below. </p> <p>The departments are themed on the natural world - the sea, the Arctic, the beach. If a nurse wants to take a child for kidney dialysis, they can say \"let's go to the beach\" and hit the lift button marked with a sea shell rather than the words \"renal unit\". </p> <p>It is a long building, but the entrance is in the shortest elevation on Lambeth Palace Road, which reduces the sense of foreboding bulk as children enter. The warm terracotta facade is broken up into sections that establish the hospital as part of the urban fabric rather than an NHS alien descended from above. Transparency from street level allows you to see clearly into the atrium, the wards and the reception and reduces the fear of the unknown. </p> <p>Of course, the Royal London Hospital will have almost 10 times as many beds and cost 10 times as much as the Evelina, which is funded almost entirely by a wealthy charitable trust with assets of \u00a3360m. Nevertheless, the evidence of these two projects suggests that the department of health is spending taxpayers' billions badly. </p> <p>Alistair Gourlay, the project manager hired by Guy's and St Thomas to deliver the Evelina, says NHS clients are asking the wrong questions when they brief the private sector to bid for new buildings. </p> <p>\"I am hoping we show that within NHS cost guidelines you can do something special,\" he says. \"PFI is predicated on the idea that if you ask the private sector, you get better. That's rubbish. If you ask the private sector, you get what you ask for.\" Perhaps if the NHS were to ask for more innovation from the private sector, some problems might dissolve. </p> <p>As Gourlay and I leave the frightening concrete tower of Guy's Hospital, where the children's hospital is operating until next year, he rebukes the receptionist in her booth: stuck to the inside of the glass is a cardboard hand, shaped to give the middle finger to patients and visitors. This gesture sums up the way our hospital buildings have treated us. The choice now is between pressing on with flawed architecture, or biting the bullet and demanding better.</p>",
  "<p>The housing market has peaked but is not heading into the abyss, analysts said today, as figures showed property price falls for the fourth consecutive month. </p> <p>Stagnation rather than deflation was the prediction for the slowing market from experts at property research company Hometrack. No counties reported any price increases, while average house prices fell by 0.6%, its October survey found. </p> <p>The excess supply of properties on the market increased again, with the number of buyers registered with estate agents falling by 3.8% and the number of properties listed increasing by 5.6%. This points to further house price falls in the coming months, Hometrack said. Agreed sales fell by 1%, and although the number is still decreasing, it is at a slower rate than previously. </p> <p>The average time taken to sell rose again to six weeks and five days and the average selling price fell to 93.7% of the asking price, the lowest Hometrack has recorded. The largest price falls occurred in Avon (down 1.6%), north London (down 1.5%), south-west, south-east and east London (all down 1.2%). </p> <p>While the south experienced the highest property price falls, values in the north were also slipping. The average national property price stands at \u00a3165,800, down 1.2% on its peak of \u00a3167,700 in June 2004. </p> <p>John Wriglesworth, Hometrack's housing economist, said: \"While rising interest rates have influenced the recent run of house price falls, the key reason for the stagnating house price environment is that house prices have finally reached their peak in the current cycle. </p> <p>\"House prices are likely to drop further over the next few months due to the current excess supply and the expected seasonal fall off in the number of prospective buyers. Prices should however begin rising again in spring next year. </p> <p>\"Overall, we continue to expect 0% house price inflation for 2005. Stagnation, not deflation, is the most likely future course of house prices over the next 18 months.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. The Environmental IQ: profiling the impact of products </strong><br> This idea is a truly timely one: it proposes a scheme in which the impact (or 'footprint') of products on the world, in terms of sustainability, fairness and health, is provided for consumers to view. The product profiles could be accessible online, or the 'EIQ' could simply be put as a figure on the packaging; both systems would empower customers to make rounded, accurate ethical choices. So, fruit that is grown on deforested land, picked by seasonal workers with no rights, and which is transported for thousands of miles for sale would have a low IQ; which seems appropriate enough.</p> <p><strong>2. Hibernation Day: an international duvet day for the world</strong><br> There has been something of a laziness renaissance in the past few years, and we've covered research that says that idleness is the key to longer life, power-napping projects in schools and a campaign for greater slacking rights (which was predictably low-key and lethargic). This idea is very much in the same vein, although I like this one particularly for its sheer ambition: that around the world, \"no businesses, schools, restaurants or shopping areas would be permitted to open\" on the day. A little dogmatic for a chilled-out idea, perhaps, but who wouldn't be ready to join in?</p> <p><strong>3. Fame Lottery: people get their 15 minutes, money goes to charity</strong><br> In a world obsessed with celebrity and fame, what better way to raise money for charity than with the Fame Lottery? It works like this: the lottery is run by a non-profit organisation who take a percentage of the proceeds to support their work. People buy the tickets in the hope of being the lottery's spokesperson that month, which would involve spots on TV, radio and the internet. So the charity gets much-needed cash, and the lottery-winner gets their ego tickled with media appearances. And the saddest thing of all? It might just work.</p> <p><strong>4. A city/country house swap network to house everyone efficiently</strong><br> Just as one can see the hand of Big Brother in the Fame Lottery, so the spectre of countless property programmes looms over this idea. The problem is that many people are buying second homes in rural locations, inflating the prices beyond the means of the locals and leaving communities half-empty for much of the year. And the solution? A swap network of city and country houses, so city slickers could escape for the weekend, while those in rural areas come up to the big smoke for their own mini-break. No need to buy, no empty villages, and nary a mention of the dreaded words 'crash pad'.</p> <p><strong>5. Lottery entry slips to have a tick box for 10% to charity</strong><br> One of the simplest ideas in the book and one of the best. Put simply, each lottery ticket should have a tick box which says next to it \"If I win over \u00a3....., I will give 10% of my winnings to charity\". There could even be a space provided for the specific charity the person wants to give to. Obviously, clear terms and conditions would be needed, but the money could be dispensed by the lottery administrators direct to ensure it reached the intended organisation. Not only would this give an extra charitable angle to the current system, but it would also help change the wayward perception that all the lottery money goes to fund refugee groups/athletes/museums/football kits (delete as applicable).</p> <p><strong>6. A proportion of defence spending to tackle the causes of terrorism</strong><br> This is one of those 'if only' ideas that make so much sense but are, to the jaded world-watcher, thoroughly unlikely to happen. Essentially, it contends that 10% of G8 countries' defence spending should be diverted into a UN (or other) development programme. The programme would aim to address the economic, political, social and religious reasons behind terrorism: a different kind of pre-emptive action, and one that would surely have better results. The campaign starts here. Interestingly, our biggest ever influx of social inventions came after the events of September 11 (including the shortest ever idea submitted to us: \"Fight terrorism: fly naked\"), and people's ideas shone with positivity amongst the pervading gloom of that time. </p> <p><strong>7. Heavy parking fines (but only for persistent transgressors) </strong><br> Trebling or quadrupling parking fines is the idea here, but only for those who persistently cross the line (or both yellow ones). Alongside this, measures would be introduced so that drivers could claim back one parking fine when renewing their road tax. As a result, occasional transgressors would not be unduly punished, whereas those who constantly get tickets would have a substantial incentive to stop doing so. This might seem drastic, but not as excessive as the mayor of Ecatepec in Mexico, who recently abolished parking tickets altogether in an effort to reduce police corruption in the city.</p> <p><strong>8. Charging the candidates for political apathy</strong><br> We've had countless ideas submitted to encourage more people to vote: drive-through voting, free beer for voters, discounts in shops with polling cards, and even voting rights from birth. This one stands out because it combines the need to get a disillusioned public involved with our wish for politicians to become more accountable. Essentially, if the turnout is below a certain level (say, 60%), the election in that area would be re-run at the expense of the candidates involved who, in the words of our social inventor, \"have clearly failed miserably to motivate the voters\". Costs of the re-run would be proportional to the number of votes cast. A further suggestion, which could be implemented in tandem, is that every vote from someone under 23 should count double: that might also prove to be a substantial cat amongst some wildly flapping pigeons.</p> <p><strong>9. A focused eco-tax on using animals in product marketing</strong><br> A great piece of simple creative thinking in evidence here: companies who use animals in their marketing and promotion should have to contribute something to preserving or helping the animal in question. Esso would have to contribute to a tiger reserve, Andrex to a dogs home, PG Tips to chimpanzee welfare and so on. It needn't necessarily be a huge amount but seeing as the companies profit from using the animals, it seems fair to give something back, and it may even prove to be a useful marketing exercise for the companies involved.</p> <p><strong>10. Using cartoons to assess middle management problems</strong><br> The theory behind this idea is that if an employee has a Dilbert (or other) cartoon up on their wall or computer, then the organisation is likely to have the problem it details. In larger organisations, therefore, one could total up the number of such cartoons and come to a figure (total number of cartoons divided by number of employees) on what might be termed 'The Dilbert Scale'. This would give a completely unscientific, but quite amusing way of comparing middle management problems in various organisations. </p> <p> These social inventions came from: </p> <p>1.

  "Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat is pumped. Two weeks ago, sitting in an internet cafe on Munich's Odeonplatz, the software marketer who crafted a hugely successful voter registration website, pulls up numbers that show a remarkable spike in Americans overseas mobilising to defeat George W Bush. Between her site and another out of Hong Kong, Democrats have registered 140,000 new voters, 40% of them from swing states - and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Americans abroad, roused to a boiling fury by a Bush doctrine that has smeared America's good name across the globe, are looking like the \"silent swing vote\" in several key battleground states. Overseas registration for both parties is up by 400% over 2000; estimates put the tally of possible civilian votes as high as 2 million. <p>Then the panicked emails start flooding in. Today, less than two weeks before the tightest presidential race in memory, untold thousands of overseas voters still have not received their ballots - and clearly won't be able to get them back in time. Late primaries and legal challenges to Ralph Nader's appearance on the ballot delayed mailings from half the battleground states. In swing states, including Florida, Ohio and New Mexico, different versions of the ballot have gone out, sowing wild confusion. In Pennsylvania alone, at least three versions were mailed overseas, in successive, chaotic waves - with Nader and without him, plus a blank one-size-fits-all ballot with no names at all. </p> <p>Activists now fear that huge numbers of Americans overseas - both military and civilian - may be as disenfranchised as they were in 2000, when anywhere from 10 to 40% of overseas ballots, depending on the county, just plain never showed up. But, far from helping civilians, the Federal Voting Assistance Programme (FVAP) has dragged its feet. A small liaison office based in the Pentagon, the FVAP provides voting materials to the departments of defence and state for soldiers and civilians abroad, and preaches overseas election law to thousands of local election officials back home. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office excoriated the agency for losing thousands of overseas votes in 2000, but the FVAP insists it has corrected its problems this year. Frustrated civilian advocates, however, say the FVAP remains biased and ineffective. Despite reforms, they attest, it still has not shaken its Pentagon roots: It spends the bulk of its energy getting out a heavily Republican vote among half a million service people - but has failed the far greater numbers of civilians (an estimated 4 million, by most counts) who tend to vote a different way. </p> <p>The tsunami of overseas civilian voters this year has only made the inequity more glaring. The agency was overwhelmed by a flood that has clogged its fax lines, telephones and email. It has blocked access to its website to civilian voters abroad, given military voters access to electronic ballot-request systems that civilians cannot use, and subcontracted sensitive election work to a company with strong Republican ties. For months, it failed to heed requests from the state department to post an emergency substitute ballot on its website that will mainly help civilians living far from consulates and military bases. Finally, on October 21, with only 12 days till the election, it will post a downloadable version of the federal write-in absentee ballot, known as FWAB: a last-ditch device intended for the precise situation in which thousands of overseas voters now find themselves. </p> <p>Those who've busted their guts to get out the overseas civilian vote on both sides are relieved but still angry. \"Considering 2000 and the fact everybody knew this was going to be a close race, they should have seen it coming,\" says Joan Hills, co-chair of Republicans Abroad. \"The obstacles that have been thrown up are incredible,\" says Jim Brenner, executive director of AOK (Americans Overseas for Kerry), an arm of the Democratic National Committee. Samuel F Wright, director of the Military Voting Rights Project of the National Defence Committee, and a Navy Reserve officer who has spent 25 years observing the FVAP, says: \"Frankly, I'm not impressed with them. They're sort of going through the motions. I've been pinging on DoD for four years that this is the perfect situation for the emergency ballot.\" Voters who have requested but not received their ballot by now can dispatch the FWAB in its place. (If the real ballot subsequently arrives, election officials are required to discard the FWAB and count the regular ballot.) </p> <p>A million hard copies of the FWAB have been sent to military bases in Germany and Asia and to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan - two for every member of the military, Wright says - who surely deserve them. But on the civilian side, the record is spottier. The state department, charged with helping civilians overseas, ordered its consulates and embassies to stockpile the form. But Democrats Abroad reports that many have been caught short-handed and that direct voter requests to the FVAP have gone unfulfilled. In one pathetic twist, employees of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart had to beg forms from the military at the gate of the base last week, a voting officer said. </p> <p>Because so much hangs on key states, and on the possibly widespread use of an untested, little-known ballot, the potential for disaster is enormous. \"If this election is close, 2000 is going to look like a cakewalk,\" says Margo Miller, a London-based lawyer for AOK. \"It's going to be so messy in so many places, the fact that the FWAB hasn't been easier to get is inexcusable.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon responds that the two major parties began asking for the online FWAB only in late September and that it has moved \"mountains of bureaucracy\" to get the form online. Starting now, the tiny bureau of 14 civil servants in suburban Virginia will get the word out to election officials in 3,142 American counties that the downloaded version of the write-in ballot is good to go. </p> <p>But the programme's record does not inspire much confidence. Indeed, voters contacting officials to ask about the ballot have been shocked at the ignorance they've encountered. In Nepal, one embassy worker said the ballot could be mailed from the United States, which it cannot; in Chester County, Pennsylvania, an election supervisor had no idea what it was. Says Wright of the Military Voting Rights Project: \"Nobody has ever heard of it. The FVAP does show up at meetings and presentations, but I bet a lot of the 5,000 election officials don't go to those meetings, judging from the very basic questions we get back.\" </p> <p>While waiting for the FVAP to act, both parties gyrated over the internet. AOK put up its own version online with the disclaimer that no one knew if such ballots would be accepted; Democrats Abroad and the two main registration websites did not. Republicans Abroad then snitched the AOK form, without the disclaimer, and put it on its site, only to shamefacedly pull it off when told that, until the FVAP formally approved it, nobody could use the darn thing. AOK finally sent out 25,000 hard copies at its own expense to voters from swing states who'd signed up on the Overseas Vote 2004 website. </p> <p>The overarching problem is the scant resources allotted civilian voters, who outnumber the military overseas by at least eight to one. While all applaud the goal of making sure men and women fighting for our country can exercise their right to vote, civilians point out that they are Americans, too. And the FVAP has a history of favouring the military, not least because the department of defence has a captive, easily identified audience and far more money and muscle than the state department. Citizens abroad are far harder to find than soldiers: Embassies have direct contact only with a small minority of those who have registered to be alerted and evacuated in case of a disaster - though one might call mass disenfranchisement a disaster of another degree. </p> <p>Highly publicised missteps this year have hardly restored faith in the FVAP. Civilian voters still have trouble getting through to the agency and are barred from the email ballot request-and-delivery website that is available to soldiers from ten states. More worryingly, a pilot email voting system signed on to by Missouri, Utah and North Dakota, in which soldiers can email ballots to a contractor that then faxes those ballots to local jurisdictions, is being operated by Omega Technologies, headed by a former Republican Party donor, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The Times also reports that earlier this week two Democratic members of Congress, Henry Waxman of California and Carolyn B Maloney of New York, asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the FVAP. Among their concerns is that the agency's online ballot-retrieval system is not open to most civilians abroad. </p> <p>Miller, the AOK lawyer, says the FVAP, which moved only two years ago from the Pentagon department that buys soap and toilet paper into the personnel department, \"is basically focused on the military and doesn't care\". A department of defence insider involved in getting out the vote overseas puts it more harshly: \"The senior military leadership will only admit they have a responsibility to help civilians get involved in elections if you force it down their throat. They're only interested in the soldiers.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon denies these charges. As each misstep has occurred, deputy undersecretary of defence Charles Abell has defended the FVAP, saying it is making a heroic effort to reach all citizens overseas through voting workshops and toll-free telephone numbers. Indeed, all observers agree that the FVAP has gone to extraordinary lengths this year to get out the military vote. Still, Democrats suspect that in the case of the online ballot, it's no accident that the agency did not move faster: The measure mainly benefits civilians, many more of whom will support John Kerry than their counterparts in the military. </p> <p>Dzieduszycka-Suinat frets darkly that \"higher up, someone is saying: 'Make sure there are problems.'\" From the perspective of Wright, from the Military Voting Rights Project, political pressure is a given. \"When Clinton was in charge, they tried to suppress the military vote for that very reason,\" he says. \"I would not disagree,\" he says, that politics this year, too, plays a role. Faced with a voting programme that at best is ineffective, and at worst partisan, ordinary citizens have been forced to pick up the slack. Wright's organisation, for instance, blitzed the country's election offices with faxed alerts telling them how to process the write-in ballot. And it is thanks mainly to the efforts of two smart groups of expatriates that tens of thousands of new voters made it through the registration process at all. The FVAP distributed millions of registration postcards, but without help, the complex rules daunted many civilians. </p> <p>The state department, stretched thin by new visa regulations imposed after 9/11, has nowhere near the resources in its consulates to help citizens that the department of defence has deployed for its soldiers abroad, a high-ranking official said. Though it has done its best to walk civilians through the 369-page \"Black Book\" of state-by-state election rules, \"we literally don't have the staff to be able to do this,\" the official said. The upshot: There is a military voting assistance officer for every 30 to 50 soldiers, but the onus is on the civilian to fill out the form alone. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad thus began the campaign season camped at card tables on foreign street corners and screenings of English-language movies, walking voters one by one through the Byzantine process. In late May, Dzieduszycka-Suinat and Mitch Wolfson, head of AOK Germany, looked at each other and said, in the words of Wolfson: \"There has to be a better way.\" In July, they took the federal registration form, simplified it, and lobbed it into cyberspace. Beyond the 140,000 mostly Democrats who registered online, another 170,000 physically registered through Democrats Abroad, according to John McQueen, the group's international campaign chair. Thousands more signed up through another clever website, the Amsterdam-based Tell an American to Vote. </p> <p>What infuriates AOK more than anything else, though, is the vast disparity in money and energy between the military and civilian efforts. Overseas civilians, who turn out at half the rate of the military, arguably need more help, they say. While FVAP spent its $5.5m budget mainly to reach half a million soldiers - a ratio that works out to $11 per vote - the Democratic National Committee spent $50,000 on a website that worked out to less than 75 cents a vote. </p> <p>Republicans eschewed pavement-pounding and bought dozens of ads in the military Stars &amp; Stripes, International Herald Tribune and English-language papers in key countries like Mexico, Canada and Israel, which together host some 1.5 million eligible American voters, says Hills of Republicans Abroad. Registrations are up fourfold over 2000. The Bush campaign is focused on large communities of American retirees overseas and counting on its traditional bases among businesspeople abroad and the military, where, Hills says, \"we're very confident we're going to get a strong majority\". </p> <p>Which way these hordes of new voters go is, in fact, the big overseas question - assuming they get to vote. Democrats and Republicans alike see gold in both the civilian and military camps. What's undisputed is that the Bush administration has galvanised overseas voters as never before. \"The entire world is against Bush, and we reflect that view that America has lost all its credibility abroad,\" says McQueen of Democrats Abroad. \"I was tired of cringing in the supermarket whenever I spoke English to my kids, knowing how much we as Americans were hated,\" says Dzieduszycka-Suinat. Hills, for her part, reports that many Republicans, angered at what they see as unjust attacks, are coming out in equal droves to support the president. On both sides, stories abound of older Americans, and dual citizens who've kept their American passports, emerging like Rip Van Winkle to vote for the first time in 30 or 40 years. </p> <p>In reality, the political affiliation of these voters is unknown. Both sides claim a 60% edge: Democrats, based on a Zogby study, say that Americans with passports tend to vote liberal. Republicans, meanwhile, cite international business and the conservatism of Pentagon civilian employees and soldiers. Yet both estimates are what military people call SWAG - scientific wild-ass guesses - about a woolly and ever-growing overseas population of civil servants, diplomats, employees of global businesses, students, journalists, artists, academics and, yes, soldiers on the battlefield. </p> <p>Since January, when the Pentagon decreed \"100% contact,\" every officer and enlisted man or woman has had a registration application pressed into his or her hands. Soldiers have been exhorted to vote at daily formation and while watching ballgames on Armed Forces TV, and they are reminded that \"It's Your Future - Vote for It\" on the bottom on their paycheques. After the \"horror story\" of 2000, the military is \"extremely vigilant\" this time around, says Captain Christina Maxwell-Borges, a voting assistance officer at the US Army Installation Management Agency in Stuttgart. </p> <p>At US Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, voting activists and Americans who've worked for the Army for decades say ordinary soldiers are more motivated than they've ever seen. Even with the massive deployment of voting officers, a non-partisan citizens group like the NAACP, which conducted registration drives on base, was swamped. \"Often we couldn't keep up with the demand,\" says Billee Manigault, an NAACP volunteer. \"There's a definite interest in participating,\" echoes Charles Keene of Democrats Abroad and the NAACP. \"From almost everyone you heard, it was, 'You better believe I'm going to vote.'\" </p> <p>Despite several recent polls showing staunch support for President Bush among high-ranking officers, soldiers on base and Pentagon civilians active in Democratic politics say the mood in the military is far more mixed. The controversial mission in Iraq has brought a sea change in political attitudes on base, these observers report. McQueen, a retired military civil servant, says, \"You're not seeing the kind of pressure to vote Republican you always had in the past.\" </p> <p>The strong pro-Republican culture that emerged in the military in the wake of Vietnam has begun to splinter, many observers say. A report in the Washington Monthly last year described rank-and-file soldiers, who are disproportionately non-white, working-class and female, as increasingly diverging from an ideologically conservative officer corps. \"For a long time here, Democrats were in the closet,\" concurs Trenton Browne, a military security contractor who works on bases from Heidelberg to Kaiserslautern. \"Now in the lower ranks you hear people speaking openly about their dissent.\" </p> <p>Gauging the overseas vote thus becomes a numbers game. Military turnout at home and abroad is high. More than 60% of soldiers overseas voted in 2000, double the record of expatriates, who turned out at a rate of 37%, according to the FVAP (though in both groups, the number of uncounted votes dropped those figures by at least 15%). Many expect even higher overseas military turnout this year. How many of those 500,000 active duty service people will vote for Kerry, or Bush, is the question. </p> <p>A survey of 4,000 service people, released last week by the Military Times, revealed strong loyalty to the president: 72% of those on active duty would vote for him, and 17% would vote for Kerry. In the view of military analyst Peter Feaver of Duke University, the early traction Kerry had with the troops has been lost by his recent hammering of the war as a \"colossal mistake\". Being a decorated Vietnam veteran doesn't improve Kerry's stock with the \"career military\" people polled by the Military Times, either; in fact, two-thirds hold the senator's long-ago anti-war activism against him. </p> <p>The survey, however, concentrated on higher-ranking service people, and is not representative of the rank and file. Along Heidelberg's main street, off-duty soldiers, some fresh from combat in Iraq, divided evenly between rejecting Kerry because \"he doesn't support the troops\" and supporting him \"because a lot of us feel jerked around\". \"People think the military is totally Republican, and that's definitely not true,\" says one strolling soldier, a burly 30-year-old from Florida. \"There's a lot of different views within the ranks.\" Capt Maxwell-Borges, the Stuttgart voting officer, agrees. \"Surprisingly, it's been really mixed,\" she says. \"A lot of people support Kerry because he's a veteran and says he's going to increase military spending, and others are the more traditional pro-Republicans. But I've been on bases in the past three elections and I have to say that this time [political views] seem a lot more varied.\" </p> <p>No one expects the soldier vote to swing to Kerry, but a softening of Bush's overseas military support could be significant. \"Even 100% military turnout overseas only equals 160,000 additional votes,\" points out Brett Rierson, co-founder of the Democratic Hong Kong website. With activists guesstimating that the overseas civilian haul could be as high as 2 million, a strong showing for Kerry among enlisted troops could neutralise the Republican advantage. </p> <p>In any event, it's unlikely anyone will know until well after November 2. Several states, in a scramble to accommodate overseas voters' late ballots, have extended their deadlines. As it now stands, Florida, Washington, Iowa, Colorado and Illinois allow ballots to be received late, in some cases up to 10 days after election day. The justice department, at the prompting of the FVAP, has sued Pennsylvania to extend its deadline by two weeks as well. </p> <p>Nor will Americans find out how effectively the overseas vote has been handled until \"after the horses have left the barn,\" says Joe Smallhoover, legal counsel for Democrats Abroad. Voting reform passed by Congress in 2002 requires states to track overseas ballots, at long last. But more to the point, Smallhoover says: \"We have to do more than reform the FVAP; we have to reform the whole system.\" Wright, the military voting expert, agrees. He advocates placing the whole overseas voting operation in the hands of the new Election Assistance Commission, a far better-funded agency created by the 2002 Help America Vote act that is supposed to help states improve their equipment and procedures. </p> <p>All this, however, lies in the future. In the meantime, Democrats Abroad has formed a \"rapid response\" team to unsnarl problems voters abroad have encountered with their county election officials. Thousands of lawyers on both sides are renting office space in battleground states, ready to pounce on illegalities in stateside balloting and absentee votes. For now, overseas voters groping their empty mailboxes can only download the write-in ballot, send it in - in the faith that local election officials will accept it - and pray. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Alix Christie is a reporter and former editor of the foreign service of the San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited</p> <p>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "<p>The British Medical Association today called on governments around the world to crackdown on the development of chemical and genetic weapons, issuing the stark warning: \"It's never been easier to develop biological weapons.\"</p> <p>If governments do not act, a number of potentially disastrous technologies could be developed, including biological weapons, which, through genetic engineering, target specific ethnic groups. These weapons could include new versions of old viruses, such as polio, smallpox, the 1918 \"Spanish Flu\", which killed millions, and genetically modified anthrax. </p> <p>The BMA's report, Biotechnology, Weapons and Humanity II, published today, paints a bleak picture of the global community's ability to cope with advances in biological and genetic weapons technology. It is a follow-up to a similar study in 1999, and concludes that the situation has rapidly declined.</p> <p>The association's head of science and ethics, Vivienne Nathanson, said: \"The situation today is arguably worse than it was when we published our last report five years ago. The very existence of international laws to protect us is being questioned, the anthrax attacks in the US in 2001 caused widespread panic and fear, and, most worryingly of all, it's never been easier to develop biological weapons - all you have to do is look on the internet.\"</p> <p>She added: \"This report does not make comfortable reading, but it is essential that governments take action on this issue now. If we wait too long it will be virtually impossible to defend ourselves.\"</p> <p>The author of the report, Malcolm Dando, head of peace studies at Bradford University, said the problem was that the same technology being used to develop new vaccines and find cures for Alzheimer's and other debilitating diseases could also be used for malign purposes. \"That is why it is essential that an ethical code be developed for scientists. Questions need to be asked about where research could lead, where the results will be published and who has access to the data,\" he said.</p> <p>To prevent the situation escalating, countries should find ways of agreeing and strengthening the 30-year-old Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) when it comes up for review in 2006, and there should be a debate about whether scientists and their funders should continue research into areas that could also be subverted for use in biological and chemical weaponry.</p>",
  "<p>Either there's something in the water at the Ivy or a significant change in thinking is taking place among the broadcasting chattering classes. All of a sudden, the talk seems to be less of TVR, CRR and NAR and more P2P, IPTV and PVR*. And if you don't have the faintest idea what any of those tags mean, perhaps it's time to start swotting. When Sky's Dawn Airey, who made her reputation as director of programmes squeezing the last drops from Five's budget, starts baffling and alarming an industry dinner with talk of the brave new world of digital choice, something is clearly afoot. </p> <p>In a Royal Television Society speech last week, she warned Channel 4, Five and in particular ITV that they were living in the past and should invest in the future. Scheduling, she warned, would become a dying art as viewers began to create their own selection of programmes through personal hard disk recorders or broadband. </p> <p>\"My worry is that I still don't think the traditional broadcasting establishment fully understands the scale of the transformation that is taking place. And until they do, commercial terrestrial television as a whole may very well be sleep-walking its way to long-term oblivion,\" she said. </p> <p>Just the week before, BBC chairman Michael Grade was singing the praises of the BBC's investment in interactive TV, and Ofcom chairman Lord Currie was warning traditional broadcasters that they were doomed. Factor in BBC director general Mark Thompson's radical reworking of the corporation's bid for charter renewal, putting new ways of accessing its programmes at its heart, and it is clearly something that the industry cannot ignore. </p> <p>Lord Currie was unequivocal. \"The rapid growth of first multi-channel, then digital, then PVRs and soon higher-speed broadband are simply the pre-tremors of the real volcanic eruption that technology is about to unleash,\" he said at yet another RTS event. \"At the risk of being over-dramatic I would say that most traditional television broadcasters are today standing about the equivalent of one mile from Mount St Helens. When it blows, frankly, that will be too close and it will be too late to run.\" </p> <p>You'd think such explicit warnings would have broadcasting grandees choking on their rubber chicken, but they were dismissed by most as more pie in the sky future gazing. We've been here before of course. During the dotcom boom, youthful management consultants would march into the offices of broadcasting executives and rather pompously tell them they were about to be swept away by an on-demand, always-on, converged future. The temptation was to file the report in the bin and go back to worrying about what should fill the 8pm Sunday drama slot. And while Airey's comments can be explained to an extent by the BSkyB chip that appears to be standard issue to all new arrivals at the company, Lord Currie's call to arms is harder to dismiss. </p> <p>But the key difference this time is that the consumer is leading the way. Already, more than 4m households are connected to broadband and more than half the country has digital television. Almost all of us have a mobile phone, with increasing numbers already listening to their iPod or watching DVDs on the move - from there it's not much of a leap to portable video players in the pocket. By the time today's filesharing, multitasking, channel-surfing teenagers are tomorrow's homeowners, the television landscape will look radically different. </p> <p>Asked to name three companies that would benefit from this technological revolution, Airey nominated \"Sky, Sky and Sky\", while singling out ITV as particularly under threat. But, with subscriber growth hitting a ceiling, Sky is facing a new challenge. At Ofcom's behest, BT is cutting the prices it charges competitors to access the so-called \"local loop\" - the crucial last mile between the telephone exchange and the home. Of com is hoping that this will lead to a host of new services, from cheap voice calls to video-on-demand and broadcast TV, to be delivered over broadband networks. And in one fell swoop, provide effective competition for BSkyB in the pay TV world and BT in the telecoms world. </p> <p>With an installed base of 7.4 million subscribers, Sky has a huge head start, of course. But the fear for chief executive James Murdoch must be that IPTV, as it's called in the US, will make good on the promises that cable rivals have been failing to deliver on for years. Linear broadcast channels, combined with on-demand content from thousands of sources and integrated phone services could provide Sky with a new challenge. </p> <p>Murdoch Jnr, an enthusiastic early adopter, is on record as saying that \"storage trumps bandwidth\", meaning that Sky is gambling on getting hard disk recorders into homes that can store hundreds of hours of content to beat content delivered by broadband. It's a threat that he's clearly taking seriously - with a massive \u00a3450m investment programme to buttress Sky from the threat to come. The wave of advertising for London-based broadband and on-demand service HomeChoice has just begun. Expect BT to make announcements by January signalling huge investment in on-demand TV services and broadcasting over broadband, together with plans to deliver high speed internet to Freeview customers. </p> <p>France Telecom, owner of Wanadoo, which has even deeper pockets, has already launched in France and is planning an imminent assault on broadcasting here. Microsoft, which has been struggling for years and wasted billions of dollars trying to break into television, believes it might have finally cracked it by offering its software to network providers to provide converged broadcast, on-demand and telephony services within a Windows-style environment. </p> <p>Among traditional broadcasters, it is clear that only the BBC has really started thinking about what the shift from linear TV to personalised TV really means. The nature of the ITV beast means that chief executive Charles Allen is more concerned with the next quarter than the next decade. But with each passing results presentation, he might just be edging a little closer to that volcano's edge. </p> <p>* TVR - TV Rating; CRR - Contract Rights Renewal; NAR - Network Advertising Revenue; P2P - Peer to Peer (filesharing); IPTV - Internet Protocol Television (TV over broadband lines); PVR - Personal Video Recorder</p>",
  "<p>Deep Blue, the movie version of BBC natural history series The Blue Planet, has taken \u00a314m in box office receipts since its release earlier this year, making it one of the corporation's most successful ventures on the big screen.</p> <p>The 90-minute documentary feature has already proved a bigger moneyspinner than any BBC-backed film of recent years apart from Billy Elliot, proving popular with cinema-goers in Europe and Japan.</p> <p>And Deep Blue's global box office revenues could eventually top \u00a320m, with the film still to open in the US and across much of Asia.</p> <p>The US rights to Deep Blue have been picked up by leading independent film producer and distributor Miramax, the company behind Oscar-winning hits such as The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love and Chicago.</p> <p>Miramax is planning to launch Deep Blue in the all-important US cinema market early next year.</p> <p>Deep Blue is the first feature film release from the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.</p> <p>The project cost around \u00a33.8m, with \u00a32.8m spent on production, which involved re-editing 70,000 hours of raw footage from The Blue Planet, recording a new musical score and voiceovers for different countries. Marketing and distribution costs accounted for the remaining \u00a31m.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said BBC Worldwide was \"hopeful\" of recouping its costs and making a profit on Deep Blue. But she added that it was difficult to put a figure on what the profit might be at this stage. </p> <p>The complex nature of feature film funding means that cinema owners, distributors and others in the financial food chain will all take a cut of any profits before BBC Worldwide receives any money.</p> <p>But BBC Worldwide will be hoping to cash in on today's release of Deep Blue on DVD and VHS in the UK. The Blue Planet has already shifted 130,000 units on DVD.</p> <p>Deep Blue has proved particularly popular with cinema audiences in France and Germany, making more than \u00a36m in these two territories alone. Japanese cinema-goers have added a further \u00a35m to box office receipts.</p> <p>The film has also been released in the UK, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Israel, the Benelux countries and eastern Europe.</p> <p>After securing a US release, BBC Worldwide and its partner in the Deep Blue project - German producer and distributor Greenlight Media - are seeking further deals in Asia.</p> <p>BBC Worldwide is planning to build on the success of Deep Blue with an even more ambitious movie spin-off from the next big BBC natural history series, Planet Earth.</p> <p>The Blue Planet's executive producer, Alastair Fothergill, and his BBC natural history unit production team are already working on Planet Earth, an 11-hour series due for broadcast on BBC1 in 2006.</p> <p>Planet Earth has a budget of around \u00a313m and nearly an extra \u00a37m will be invested by BBC Worldwide in creating the movie spinoff, pencilled in for a world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2007.</p> <p>The idea for Deep Blue developed from a cut-down version of The Blue Planet put together for the Proms in 2002, with a specially commissioned score written by composer George Fenton, according to BBC Worldwide marketing director Alix Tidmarsh, who executive produced the movie spinoff.</p> <p>After Greenlight Media has helped raise the money to make Deep Blue, Ms Tidmarsh and her team set about choosing what sequences to include the The Blue Planet's raw footage.</p> <p>Around 25% of Deep Blue's 90-minute running time is made up of footage that was not used in The Blue Planet.</p> <p>\"There was a heck of a lot of footage that wasn't used in the TV series, so we went back to the drawing board with the rushes. We wanted to do something different with the footage - Deep Blue is not a documentary, it's an emotional piece. We wanted people to learn something, but it's more about people getting immersed in the film,\" Ms Tidmarsh said.</p> <p>Mr Fenton was hired again to write the music for Deep Blue, working with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra on its first ever movie score.</p> <p>Ms Tidmarsh has been able to make more ambitious plans for the movie spinoff from Planet Earth.</p> <p>This time round she has a bigger budget - nearly \u00a37m - and is able to get extra footage shot for the theatrical version filmed during production of the TV series, rather than having to rely solely on material intended for the BBC1 show.</p> <p>One of the additional elements being shot for the movie version is aerial footage of landscapes and animals moving across terrain, which is being filmed in high definition and 35mm.</p> <p>\"With The Blue Planet and Deep Blue, the TV documentary told you the why and how, where as the cinema release was just a rollercoaster ride - a whistle stop tour, have some fun. I think they complimented each other very well and we'll be trying for the same thing with Planet Earth,\" Ms Tidmarsh said.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "President Ibrahim Rugova of Kosovo last night declared victory in the province's general election, which was marred by a Serb boycott. <p>Saturday's elections, overshadowed by the refusal of the vast majority of Serbs to vote in ethnic Albanian-dominated Kosovo, dealt a blow to international efforts to forge a multiethnic society there. </p> <p>Serb leaders in Kosovo and Serbia proper had called the boycott, saying the UN and Nato had failed to create an environment where Serbs could live safely. </p> <p>Preliminary results were not expected until today and final official results will be declared a week later. </p> <p>Mr Rugova claimed his Democratic League of Kosovo party had garnered more than 50% of the vote, retaining its position as the main party. </p> <p>Ibrahim Makolli from the Pristina-based Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms said the Democratic party of Kosovo came second with 27%, followed by the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo with 8%. Both are led by former ethnic Albanian rebel leaders. </p> <p>Kosovo's ethnic Albanians - who make up 90% of the 2 million population - viewed the elections as a means to further their goal of securing independence. Kosovo Serbs and Belgrade want the province to remain part of Serbia-Montenegro. </p> <p>A projection indicated that none of the ethnic Albanian parties could govern alone, echoing the previous election three years ago, which resulted in a political stalemate for three months. </p> <p>Officials did not specify how many Serbs cast ballots but said their turnout was very low. Overall turnout was estimated at 53%. </p> <p>There appeared to be disenchantment also in the ranks of ethnic Albanians unhappy with the progress made since the end of the 1998-99 Kosovo war, because officials have failed to address the dire economic situation. An estimated 60% unemployment rate has exacerbated political woes.</p> <p><b>Associated Press</b></p>",
  "<p>When I started out in business over 30 years ago I had a great publishing concept, a fantastic team, a full advertising order book, and a ground-breaking new music magazine on the stocks ready to send to the printer. Looking for a distributor, I encountered for the first time the old boys' network, the alliance between vested interest and complacent apathy. \"The magazine wouldn't work\". \"It hadn't been done before, so it couldn't be done now\". \"You have no track record\". It seemed I'd be finished before I began. Then one independent distributor saw the potential. We launched International Musician in 1974, and within a few short years we had a worldwide network of music magazines and were branching out into the computer, motoring, cycling, fitness, cooking, environmental, adult and other specialist titles that carried us through the 1980s. </p> <p>That was how I became a publisher. When I left school at the age of 15 I had planned to be a professional drummer but my family thought otherwise and lined up an interview with Clerical Medical and General Insurance Company. I failed the interview because I had no qualifications and took to music magazines because they linked my love of music with my aptitude for business. Then, in the early 90s, the opportunity came to sell some specialist magazines for \u00a320m. My board and I faced a decision. Should we go for the mainstream and invest half the gain in making good our claim to be Britain's leading independent media group, or take it easy and spend the dosh? </p> <p>We went for it. Why only half the gain? Because my philosophy is gamble only half of what you can afford to lose. It's perhaps different for guys who are playing with other people's money, maybe like Little Johnny [Harmsworth, Lord Rothermere] who has nearly a billion pounds in debt. Over the next few years we steadily invested - or lost - our fighting fund. At the time you don't know which. Then I had to break my own rule and put in more money. It took from 1992 until 1999 to make OK! the market leader and profitable, and even longer to reach our present position of often outselling our rival by two to one. We also launched the subscription-based Fantasy Channel which took a mere four years of investment to turn a profit. </p> <p>Then, in 2000, we were anticipating about \u00a320m ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and I was looking forward to taking a bonus for a change. Enter the Express deal. Instead of taking the bonus I had to put back \u00a330m and add a personal guarantee of another \u00a310m. OK!, the other magazines and the channel were also put up as collateral. All this on a business that respected analysts had said was finished and newspaper pundits said we could never control even if the regulators allowed us to keep it. Certainly Little Johnny and Big Connie [Lord Black] were most effective in portraying me as some kind of marauding monster, not, of course, that either of these gentlemen ever influence their own editorial! In addition, banks, paper suppliers, politicians, TV companies and advertisers were all subjected to a campaign of vile lobbying against me by various parties that persisted for the first two years. </p> <p>Now, four years on, we've shown the doubters a thing or two. We've beaten all predictions. Not just as cost cutters either. Of course it's well known I like efficiency and hate cash leakage, and with my finance director and managing director I sign off all the monthly payments because that's the best insight into the detail of a business you can have. In four years we have increased the turnover of the newspapers from \u00a3240m to \u00a3340m and that of the magazines by a similar percentage, even after the sale of the adult titles, which despite their profile only amounted to less than 2% of our turnover. </p> <p>We now employ well over 2,000 people at our new headquarters at Number 10 Lower Thames Street and various other premises including Broughton printers and West Ferry printers in partnership with the Telegraph Group, our Scottish offices, our Dublin joint venture with Sir Tony and Gavin O'Reilly, and our TV operation in the Docklands where we have just launched a shopping channel (Sky and NTL channels 637 - don't miss it!). In addition there are, of course, the indirect employees, freelancers and suppliers which add up to thousands more. For cost cutters we make a remarkable contribution to the economy. </p> <p>Until Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay, we were the only fully private company in newspapers, so there has been disproportionate media attention to my own remuneration - disproportionate because they always talk about it when it goes out but never when I put it in! What they don't report is that I am finally realising a return after investing for over 30 years. </p> <p>We are as successful as we can possibly be. The Daily and Sunday Expresses show increased revenues and market share and Daily Star circulation has reached around double the year 2000 figure, bucking every known media trend. Similarly with the Daily Star Sunday, which we launched two years ago and which, including the Irish edition, now tops 600,000 copies. OK! is dominant in the UK and I look with pride on its launches in China, Australia and the Middle East. New! magazine (ABC 400,000) and Star magazine (over 200,000 weekly sales after just one year) are both showing a profit - if only it had been that quick with OK!. The next venture is a new shopping magazine planned to rival the most upmarket productions of Cond\u00e9 Nast and NatMags. Our new City of London HQ is state of the art and I take a genuine pleasure when staff tell me how good it is to work in a pleasant environment. </p> <p>Which brings us to the present, the London evening paper, and shades of 1974. I have a great new product with everything in place, but I've come back to that old problem. An establishment competitor, who doesn't even make a pretence of using it to the full, sews up distribution. Having observed the procedures the Office of Fair Trading has to work within I think if I had a monopoly I'd feel quite relaxed. The process is so slow a would-be competitor could go skint while he was waiting for them to decide. Perhaps we should launch without distribution just to prove the point. We're still outsiders, and apart from Rupert Murdoch who continues to achieve so much by questioning established wisdom, the media old boy network remains a force. I was amazed when Channel 4 recently dropped a planned documentary about Little Johnny. I have no idea why they did that but I wish they'd done that for me. Nevertheless, I can't complain. I'm living the dream, my readers, advertisers and suppliers are my friends and supporters. I've even been made a Ludwig drum endorsee for getting the kit out again to do charity gigs. And after all, it's only rock and roll.</p>",
  "<p>PR<br><strong>The politics of chat</strong><br> What's a poor publicist to do? When it comes to getting your clients on TV nowadays there are more chat shows than you can shake a remote at - currently over a dozen on terrestrial TV alone - but the five daily daytime slots are the hungriest. BBC Breakfast, GMTV, Des &amp; Mel, Richard &amp; Judy, and now Paul O'Grady all need good guests, and it's often down to the publicists to choose which shows to pitch for. </p> <p>In the fight to secure your client an appearance, long-term relationships with producers and researchers count for a lot. However, you can't be everybody's friend because you're always refusing or being refused, or changing your mind or reacting to someone else's change of mind. </p> <p>The marketing brain will usually plump for the show with the biggest viewing figures, but the PR way is to identify the interview-chemistry likely to give the viewer the most memorable entertainment and guarantee both parties look good. </p> <p>Which show you want to get on depends on the time of day, the audience profile, your client's status in the eyes of the interviewer (Ross loves movie stars, Skinner loves lads 'n' totty) and the show's \"agenda\". </p> <p>Also, particularly if your client is American, any inducements being offered by way of airfares, hotels, fees and so on, can make all the difference. Money talks. All the big British shows try to maintain a presence in California so that when an A-list star pitches up in London he or she has a vague idea who Frank is, and why they might want to appear on his show. </p> <p>And now there's a whole new category of show around, featuring the \"Trevor McDonald factor\", when someone in the headlines, such as Rebecca Loos, appears not in the context of entertainment but as a populist news item, marketable via widespread syndication. Chat then comes second, and is happy to wait its turn. </p> <p>Ratings rule. Was the spat between Richard and Judy's production team and Paul O'Grady's genuine? Or was it just a scam to whip up some better viewing figures for both? The hapless publicist gets lumbered whatever happens. If the celeb is obnoxious, drunk or performs poorly, it's the publicist's fault, and if the interviewer is badly briefed and forgets the client's name then it's also the publicist's fault. And if everything runs perfectly? Did you ever see a publicist in the credits? <br><strong>Mark Borkowski</strong></p> <p> <strong>Magazines</strong><br><strong>Muslim mags make a mark</strong><br>\"A conflict between Islam and the west is threatening to engulf the world.\" These heartening words open New Civilisation, a political quarterly launched this month. Also hitting the shelves is the one-year anniversary issue of Emel, a glossy Muslim lifestyle magazine whose cover story is about the international aid organisation, M\u00e9decins San Fronti\u00e8res. </p> <p>Two magazines, two very different approaches, but one common theme: British Muslims, more often written about than writing themselves, are trying to create a platform for their views - and finding there is an untapped media market. </p> <p>\"We're trying to show Muslims in three dimensions rather than the stereotypes,\" says Sarah Joseph, editor of Emel. The magazine's focus is much more on lifestyle, with sections on architecture, gardening and food. The latest issue contains articles on both Islamic finance and pashminas. </p> <p>The magazine's 20,000 print run is sold through bookstores and Muslim organisations as well as being used by schools as a teaching resource. </p> <p>When it began, the magazine was a risky venture, but Joseph says it has paid off: \"It's captured people's imagination in a way we didn't anticipate. Maybe it's just the right thing at the right time.\" </p> <p>Timing was also crucial for New Civilisation. The thinking for the magazine began in the period after September 11, says the magazine's editor Sajjad Khan: \"Islamic political ideas weren't coming through in the debate.\" Islam, he says, was portrayed either as a violent, anti-western religion, or as just another religion. \"We wanted to present a third way.\" </p> <p>New Civilisation starts from the point of view that Islamic political thinking is in a different category to right/left distinctions, something Khan hopes to reflect. \"The right and the left share secular values but have disagreements on policy issues. We come from a non-secular perspective. That's a different proposition,\" he says. </p> <p>Khan and his backers certainly think there is a market for those ideas - he hopes the initial print run of 4,000 will expand to 25,000 over 18 months - although with articles running over a thousand words and dealing with Lockean philosophy, it is likely to be select.<br><strong>Faisal al Yafai</strong></p> <p><strong> Publishing</strong><br> <strong>Science for all</strong><br>A fierce debate is raging through the traditionally insular world of science journals. This week, the government responds to a recent report from the Commons science and technology committee which called for publicly funded scientific research to be made freely available. </p> <p>The buzzword being bounced around the ivory towers is \"open access\" - using the internet to allow anyone to read research papers for free. Either academics or their universities can set up their own internet repositories of articles that have been published in a traditional journal, or dons can submit their research to an \"open access\" journal. </p> <p>Last week saw the launch of PLoS Medicine, the second open access journal published by the US-based Public Library of Science. It is aimed at the same market as Reed Elsevier's the Lancet. But it is free. </p> <p>Dr Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest medical research charity, believes free access is vital, especially in the fight against disease in the developing world. \"Research findings need to be freely and widely available to help scientists achieve the discoveries needed to improve health,\" he says. </p> <p>Instead of charging subscription fees, open access journals charge academics to publish their work. Known as \"author pays\", this model could potentially be a real challenge to the major traditional publishers such as Reed Elsevier and Germany's Springer. </p> <p>So far, businessmen in the square mile have played down the threat as such journals have attracted a tiny proportion of the market. But the industry looks ripe for a shake-up. In the past 20 years, subscriptions to scientific and medical journals have risen by an average of 9.4% per year, four times the rate of inflation over that period. </p> <p>Dr Ian Gibson MP, head of the Commons science and technology select committee, puts it more succinctly: \"Journals are the hard currency of research. Many people who need to read journals are struggling to gain access to them. It is vital to the health of UK and global science that the situation improves.\" </p> <p>It seems unlikely, however, that open access publishing will spread into the humanities or other branches of publishing. Medicine and science occupy a special niche as research is usually heavily funded by governments or charities, while the results often have important repercussions in the developing world. <br><strong>Richard Wray</strong></p> <p><strong> Television</strong><br> <strong>Wales is watching</strong><br> Since ITV plc formed a year ago its London-based chief executive Charles Allen has discovered that Wales is feeling very sensitive about its treatment within his ITV empire. It is the one national region included in the merger (unlike Scotland or Northern Ireland). Allen's response to the unease is to appoint Roger Lewis, the former head of Classic FM, a Welsh speaker born in the Welsh valleys, as ITV Wales's next managing director. </p> <p>But media regulator Ofcom's senior officials found themselves facing fierce and united cross-party opposition last week in Cardiff, first at the Welsh Assembly's Culture Committee, then at a Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference nearby. </p> <p>Phase Two of Ofcom's public service plan proposes halving the amount of regional ITV programmes which are made within England. That said, it puts regional programmes made in Wales into a separate category, to be decided later, and Welsh activists fear the worst. Ofcom is gloomy about the long-term future for regional programmes, beyond news. </p> <p>But Ofcom's research also shows that demand for regional programming is growing in distinct areas, such as Wales. Ofcom partner Robin Foster envisages a phased withdrawal for ITV from regional programming and argues that after the digital switchover no one can force ITV to continue these shows. </p> <p>Gareth Price, a former controller of BBC Wales, now director of the Thomson Foundation in Cardiff accuses Ofcom of going along with ITV \"scaremongering\". Leighton Andrews, the Labour Welsh assembly member for the Rhondda Valley, says, \"Our biggest worry is that as we value the programmes ITV makes in Wales, we want to see them continuing.\" </p> <p>Longer term, people are asking whether Wales could benefit from having a Cardiff-based Welsh public service publisher, the new broadcasting fund proposed by Ofcom. Or perhaps Ofcom could fund the potential gap in local Welsh programming in English, which would be created by ITV's withdrawal. </p> <p>Separately, there is an Ofcom review in progress over what to do about S4C, the Welsh-language channel which relies on \u00a385m a year from the Treasury, and free programming from the BBC. It has lost a third of its audience to Channel 4, plus millions in advertising. S4C's chief executive Huw Jones announced he will retire at the end of 2005, leaving the channel's fate at the crossroads.<br>Maggie Brown</p>",

On Sundays, the Observer, Sunday Times, Independent on Sunday and the Mail on Sunday. </p> <p> <strong> Magazines: </strong> The Spectator, New Statesman, Profile, Progress, House magazine, Parliamentary Monitor, Prospect and Red Pepper. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> I reviewed John Lloyd's book, What the Media are Doing to Our Politics, and I think he's right. I enjoyed The Right Nation: Why America is Different by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge. And I've started William Hague's book on William Pitt: so far so good. </p> <p> <strong> TV: </strong> I'm an avid viewer of The West Wing - it's so fast-moving. Like a Stoppard play, if you don't listen to every word you're lost after a minute or two. I watch Newsnight, A Week in Politics and some Yes, Ministers. </p> <p> <strong> Radio: </strong> The Today programme. The World Tonight and Today in Parliament. Also Classic FM: it shows up Radio 3. I listen to CTR when in Kent. </p> <p> <strong> Ads: </strong> Classic FM turn the volume up on the ads and it drives me up the wall. I'm looking forward to Christmas because of the Famous Grouse ads with their cute play on words. And the Barbados Tourist Office ad: the weather today is sunny, as you'll recall yesterday it was sunny, and tomorrow it will be sunny, and the long range forecast is sunny. It's wonderful. </p> <p> <strong> New media: </strong> nytimes.com, washpost.com and a marvellous thing called Magenta (magentanews.com), which gives me all the cuttings about Mori and other research all over the world. epolitix.com is terrific; it's done by people who understand British politics.

  "<p>Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the sheer size of Procter &amp; Gamble's annual marketing budget is that the company rarely says anything about it. Massive but silent, fuelled by the UK's largest main media advertising spend of \u00a3200m, P&amp;G inexorably continues on its mission to market its brands further and further into the hearts and minds of consumers and, of course, their wallets. </p> <p>The scale is enormous. P&amp;G is in every supermarket aisle with brands such as Fairy, Flash, Pantene, Bounty and Crest. More than 80% of British and Irish households buy at least two P&amp;G brands each month, from a portfolio that stretches all the way to Pringles, Vicks, Hugo Boss and Lacoste. </p> <p>At the helm is Roisin Donnelly, UK &amp; Ireland head of marketing and corporate marketing director. \"I think I was born to be in marketing,\" says Donnelly, a 43-year-old mother of three girls aged 3, 5 and 7. \"I used to collect proofs of purchase even when there were no promotions. There was one Christmas when I got my gifts all from consumer promotions. I was eight and a half. My grandmother got a plastic jug from the toothpaste we were using.\" </p> <p>Her mission is to \"delight\" the consumer and get close to her, she says. It is always a \"her\" in P&amp;G land, for as Donnelly says, their research shows that even if it is a male shopper, most decisions are made by the woman of the household. Donnelly's war chest tops the government spend of \u00a3122.8m last year and L'Or\u00e9al's \u00a396m. And the P&amp;G marketing budget for in-store promotions, direct mail, public relations and market research is \u00a3400m. </p> <p>Donnelly projects supreme confidence. She gained an MA in English and studied maths and economics at Glasgow university, where she got the better of future MPs Charles Kennedy and Liam Fox by winning a maiden speaker award. </p> <p>The only time she momentarily appears blindsided is when asked about P&amp;G's famous secrecy. \"It was very much the company philosophy that if we tell you our secrets we would lose the competitive edge,\" she says. But the company has become much more open since AG Lafley became its global head in 2000. Marketers have a heavy presence in its executive ranks. </p> <p>Donnelly, who leads a marketing de partment of 70 and corporate marketing department of 65, says: \"Our philosophy is that the consumer is the boss. They make the purchase decision every day. If we delight her, she will reward us with sales. If we disappoint her, she won't.\" </p> <p>The company is increasing its advertising spend as it launches new products, and it does not shirk the unorthodox. To reach children, its Sunny D brand sponsored the virtual swimming pool on a children's website. To reach young working women, a billboard for its Aussie shampoo sent a competition entry code to their mobile phones. </p> <p>And then there is Maureen McGrath, a Dot Cottonish character from its mini soap opera adverts for Daz, who has just been ruthlessly killed off. </p> <p>\"Poor Maureen,\" says Donnelly. But consumers get to share in Maureen's legacy via discount coupons in Daz boxes. \"Will everyone get their hands on Maureen's millions? Find out with Daz, the soap you can believe in,\" chirps the latest advert, launched last week. </p> <p>\"People have now got used to Maureen and she is now leaving her money to the Daz consumer. It's a brand new way of TV interacting with the consumer,\" says Donnelly. \"We have understood the Daz consumer. She likes Daz, she has a relationship with Daz, but we have taken that to a new level with this soap. She has got more engrossed in the characters.\" </p> <p>And presumably more engrossed in Daz, at the expense of rival brands. Another Daz competition offered shoppers a prize of appearing in a Daz advert. Castings were held in shopping centres. \"They knew the campaign, they loved the campaign, they wanted to be on telly. It's just different ways of making the advertising come much closer to the consumer,\" says Donnelly. </p> <p>That means listening and understanding. If new members of the marketing team for Pampers don't know how to change a nappy, they are sent out to learn. </p> <p>When consumers told Donnelly they wanted advertising to get out of the kitchen, she sent Ridley Scott's son, Luke, to Iceland to film an Ariel advert in which an Eskimo woman washes her baby's jumpsuit in a hole carved out of the ice. </p> <p>Television advertising has been the lifeblood of P&amp;G's marketing, but that is changing. It still spends 80% of its media budget on TV but increasing sums are being spent on other media. </p> <p>Donnelly sees the future of P&amp;G marketing as being all about talking to consumers in different ways. She cites industry research which suggests that viewers used to recall 70% of what they saw on TV, but that has plunged to 41%. A growing focus is interactive advertising, which can be \"red button\" sites on interactive television. </p> <p>For its Flash cleaning brand, P&amp;G organised an interactive site that tied in with the Disney film Lilo &amp; Stitch, offering a film trailer, free toys and a quiz about messy people. Consumers spent an average of nine minutes interacting with Flash on the site - not bad for a household cleaner. \"For somebody to spend that amount of time with TV really surprises us, but interactive TV is a very powerful medium because the woman is in control.\" </p> <p>Word of mouth is just another medium to use to promote products. \"If a consumer uses a product, discovers something new and loves it, she'll tell a friend.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G uses word of mouth to sell Eraser, a new cleaner that removes difficult stains such as crayon from walls. \"We are getting it into the hands of the right consumers, expert consumers, people who chat to a lot of friends. We are sending it to magazines. It has been recommended by the Good Housekeeping Institute.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G targets experts and \"influencers\". If it is selling beauty, it talks to makeup artists and sends products to celebrities in the hope that they will mention them in magazine interviews. </p> <p>For young people, P&amp;G harnesses recently developed instant messaging technology through a system called Tremor. \"We tell the Tremor members about something or we give them gifts or insights or snippets of news and they share it with their friends.\" </p> <p>But for all the money it devotes to market research, Donnelly is negative about the traditional market research focus group. \"I think the biggest mistake is the focus group, where you get a small number of women into a room who have never met each other and they talk for an hour and a half or two hours about a product and an ad. You are paying them and it's a very blunt instrument. I think you would get more from 10 hours with one woman than you would get from one hour with 10 women.\"</p>",
  "<p>The next time you are having a bad day at work and feel like letting rip at those around you, just go ahead and do it. Research has discovered that, somewhat counterintuitively, swearing and whingeing to colleagues can actually help boost team morale. </p> <p>Researchers at New Zealand's Victoria University have found that whingeing or whining - described in perfect academese as a \"long or repeated expression of discontent not necessarily intended to change or improve the unsatisfactory situation,\" - is both a useful emotional release and a good way of building a rapport with others. \"Team-mates regularly have a moan to each other,\" says the report. \"Whingeing to a sympathetic co-worker both reflects and constructs the close relationship between team members, thus consolidating the team's solidarity.\" </p> <p>Even if colourful language is used in the moaning process, it's generally deemed as acceptable, according to the study. Professor Janet Holmes, the study's director, explains that in the appropriate context, swearing is not offensive and demonstrates the fact that language is constantly evolving. The study also found that in many cases where bad language is aimed directly at someone, it's less likely to be taken as an insult than it is to mean \"I like you, so I can be rude to you.\" </p> <p>Nicholas Emler, a professor of social psychology at the University of Surrey, isn't surprised by the findings. \"Other research on group cohesion suggests that it tends to be boosted by the perception that there is a common enemy out there - whether it's a group of people, a person or a situation - that we all collectively loathe,\" he explains. \"Gossiping about that common enemy therefore helps build group morale.\" </p> <p>The traditional image of gossip, as we are all well aware, is that it's the work of idle or malicious minds, and always damaging. \"None of these things are probably true,\" says Professor Emler. \"In fact, it has other benefits in addition to team-building.\" It can, for example, be a fundamental way of keeping people informed about the organisation they work for. \"It's simply not the case that most gossip is completely inaccurate,\" he says. \"Most of us are not stupid enough to listen to information that is likely to be untrue. Sensible people work like good journalists by checking their sources. So if you hear someone complaining about something or someone at work, you find out if it's correct and if it is, you learn something about your working environment as a result.\" </p> <p>According to the professor, whining at work can also be valuable in showing up people's personalities, agendas and priorities - as well as the relationship between different people. \"If you find out that the complaint your colleague has made about something or someone is untrue, for instance, you've found something out about them, notably that you can't trust them. This will no doubt be useful in your working life.\" </p> <p>Nigel Nicholson, professor of organisational behaviour at the London Business School, says he wouldn't be surprised if collective complaining in the workplace is even more prevalent in the UK than in New Zealand, where the research was carried out. \"Britain is a nation of whingers,\" he says. \"You find the Brits complaining wherever you go.\" </p> <p>Colleagues being rude to each other to show that they like one another is also common in Britain, he believes. So next time your boss or colleague tells you to sod off, you may not want to take it to heart. \"By using language that would in other contexts be risky, they are demonstrating that the relationship can withstand conventional limits and is therefore stronger,\" explains Professor Nicholson. </p> <p>The very act of grumbling can be enough to make you feel better. As Kathryn Waddington, senior lecturer in psychology at City University, puts it: \"It can act as a great stress-reliever. In an increasingly stressful working climate, this is key. More and more employers recognise the importance of emotion in the workplace. You'll hear them use terms like 'emotional literacy' and 'emotional intelligence'. I would argue that gossip can be another constructive means of expressing and managing emotion - anger, envy and frustration towards a colleague or situation may be expressed as gossip. Alternatively, people may gossip as a way of dealing with anxiety - if they feel unsettled at work, for example.\" Many of the research subjects she has dealt with have said that they use gossip to let off steam and describe it as a cathartic and sometimes therapeutic experience. </p> <p>And contrary to popular opinion, both sexes indulge in gossip. A study on gossip in organisations that Waddington co-authored found that, although men tend to deny it or call it something else, they are as partial as women to a little private conversation. \"We found the men were much less likely to own up to gossip,\" she says. \"They called it by other names such as 'de-briefing' or 'networking' and would say things like 'Now I'm not one to gossip, but ...' The women, on the other hand, were more likely to be honest and say 'Let's go outside for a gossip.'\" </p> <p>Waddington believes that even if you loathe moans and groans at work, you shouldn't try to stop them. \"The reality is that you can't stop it. It simply moves underground. I recently visited an organisation where all the common rooms, canteens and smoking rooms - the places where gossip occurred - had been removed. But rather than gossip ceasing, it simply cropped up in other places like meetings.\" People, it seems, will always find it good to talk.</p>",
  "<p>Trendy city dwellers recently voted Tory MP Boris Johnson the epitome of cool, alongside Hollywood star Brad Pitt, fashion label Diesel and upmarket lingerie brand Agent Provocateur. Admittedly this was before his magazine's Scousal abuse, but it still shows that politics is changing. Could it be better to be a party political animal than just a party animal? </p> <p>\"I've got the best job in the world, for the best boss in the world\", says Johnson's secretary, Melissa Crawshay-Williams. \"He's an incredibly busy person, and I keep the show going for him. I open the 100 letters and 50 emails that he receives daily, and I'm webmaster of his blog site. People fall over themselves to work here, because it looks good on their CV. But they soon find out working for an MP is not glamorous - it's extremely hard work\". </p> <p>Diane Davidson, secretary to Liberal Democrat MP, Alastair Carmichael, agrees. \"You have to be motivated to work on your own, as your boss is always out and about,\" she says. \"I draft letters for his approval, answer the phone, and manage his diary. There is a huge volume of work and you can't leave it to pile up, because you need to ensure your MP is always seen in a good light.\" </p> <p>Technology has changed the nature of the job perhaps more for politicians' staff than for anyone else. Previously, their employers could only be contacted by the laborious process of letter-writing. Email has made them far more accessible. \"People are very interested in health and the environment, for example,\" says Caroline Balcon, secretary to Conservative MP David Cameron. \"They contact their MPs in much greater numbers than before - which has a knock-on effect on me because, as my MP's gatekeeper, I'm the one who deals with constituents' letters, emails and phone calls.\" </p> <p>All 659 MPs employ their own staff - whose fates depend on their MP's success, or otherwise, at election time. If they lose their seats, their employees lose their jobs. \"MPs' staff fly by the seat of their pants\", says Alex Hilton, researcher to Labour MP Linda Perham and assistant editor at <a href=\"http://www.W4MP.org.\">www.W4MP.org.</a> There are other problems too. \"Along with the high staff turnover, there isn't great career progression,\" says Hilton. \"MPs have a budget of \u00a370,000 for three staff, and they can only promote you so far. After that you have to move on and out, if you are ambitious.\" </p> <p>Secretarial duties can range from the usual typing and shorthand tasks to undertaking parliamentary research, to being case workers, tackling complicated issues for constituents. There are also positions as senior researchers, senior secretaries, executive PAs, parliamentary assistants and office managers, although according to Hilton, these titles all mean much the same thing. \"It's unusual to have a sharp demarcation of roles for support staff,\" he says. \"Because there is only a small team, you are usually expected to pitch in and do everything.\" </p> <p>Sandra Lloyd, office manager to Lib Dem MP Dr Evan Harris, is based in Dr Harris's constituency rather than Westminster and likens her job to that of a social worker. \"It is very stressful, dealing with constituents' problems,\" she says. \"People think I am rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous all day long, but this place is more like a Citizen's Advice Bureau. Interns come here thinking it's going to be a bed of roses, but you need to be mature and resilient to deal with all the problems people walk through the door with.\" </p> <p>Many support jobs in the Westminster village are not advertised, because the place still operates to some extent on a \"who you know, not what you know\" basis. Peter Vines, office manager to Tory MP John Gummer, advises hopefuls to read House magazine, the in-house magazine of the Palace of Westminster. He also suggests looking in political weeklies like New Statesman and the Spectator. The three main parties also advertise vacancies on <a href=\"http://www.W4MP.org.\">www.W4MP.org.</a> Other ways in are to send your CV to the Whips' office of your preferred party or to keep an eye on jobs advertised in newspapers like the Evening Standard and the Guardian. But if you want to work in the constituency rather than in Westminster, those jobs will be advertised in the local press. </p> <p>Alternatively, target your application intelligently to your own MP, MEP or local council. You stand more chance if you are a member of the party you want to work for. You could also get your foot in the door by offering to work as a volunteer for your local MP. There are also other secretarial and administrative jobs in Parliament, besides working for an MP, details of which can be found at &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.parliament.uk.\"</p> <p>It's\"&gt;www.parliament.uk</p> <p>It's even possible to climb from a supporting position to the very top of the political heap. Foreign secretary Jack Straw began his parliamentary career as researcher to MP Barbara Castle, and ex-speaker of the House Betty Boothroyd started her political career as a secretary. Researcher Alex Hilton plans to stand at the next election as a prospective MP. But he advises caution. \"The Westminster village is a very small world, so don't alienate people on your way up. You need to demonstrate discretion and loyalty.\" And he confirms that you don't have to be posh to get into politics. </p> <p>\"You don't even have to wear a suit,\" he says. \"Working in Westminster is fun, there's a buzz about the place. You can just get your job done and go home, or you can really get involved - and that will get you noticed. You can go places here if you want to; you can really make a splash.\"</p>"
