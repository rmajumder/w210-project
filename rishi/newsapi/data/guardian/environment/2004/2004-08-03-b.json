  "<p>The European Commission yesterday accused global credit card and payment system company Visa International of breaching EU competition rules by refusing to admit American bank Morgan Stanley to its network in Europe. </p> <p>Visa, an unlisted grouping of 21,000 banks and financial services providers, retorted that it was defending competition by denying a direct competitor access to its proprietary information. </p> <p>A statement from the commission said the decision by Visa to bar the American investment bank from its network of connected shops and merchants in the EU because it operated the rival Discover card in the United States was discriminatory. </p> <p>Owners of several other payment card schemes had been admitted as Visa members - notably Citigroup, which owns the global Diners Club network. </p> <p>\"The commission is concerned that this Visa membership rule is not applied in an objective and non-dis criminatory manner vis-a-vis all applicants for Visa membership,\" it said. </p> <p>\"Visa has failed to explain why a global network such as Diners Club, which operates in over 200 countries including Europe, should be less of a threat to Visa than a regional network like Discover, which operates only in the US and does not have any presence in Europe,\" it said. </p> <p>David Masters, a spokesman for Visa International in London, said that since Morgan Stanley operated a rival credit card, \"any decision that allows them access to proprietary Visa information will inevitably reduce competition between payment systems\". </p> <p>Visa has three months to respond to the commission's concerns and can request an oral hearing.</p>",
  "If you spend much time in Dudley in the West Midlands, it is difficult to miss the zoo. It stands on a steep wooded hill, the steepest for miles, a freakish island of green among the roundabouts and redbrick and former factories. Inside the zoo, the outside world soon recedes. The chatter of the enclosures replaces the growl of traffic. The occasional keeper passes, looking deeply tanned and calm. Animals chew and stare. Paths for visitors curl and divide and disappear into the shadows. <p>Not even the keepers, some of who live inside the perimeter fence, claim to know everything that goes on in the zoo, especially after closing time. So when, first thing one morning in April, they found one of the zoo's half dozen wallabies with a broken leg, they were not immediately suspicious. \"It was quite a severe break,\" says the zoo's curator, Matthew Lewis, \"but it could have been thunder that spooked them.\" It had been raining hard in Dudley the day before. \"Or it could have been a fight between the wallabies; a dominance thing.\" </p> <p>There were also signs, though, that outside the wallaby enclosure, litter bins had been moved. Foxes were known to roam the zoo at night, even to leap into the animal pens - the fence around the wallabies had recently been raised and partly electrified to prevent this - but foxes were not strong enough to roll over the heavy bins. So the keepers set up a video camera a discreet distance from the wallabies, and trained it on their enclosure. </p> <p>For a fortnight, nothing unusual was recorded. The injured wallaby was put down. Taking it away from the group for treatment was impractical, says Lewis matter-of-factly. \"The others would probably have rejected it.\" </p> <p>Then, on the morning of May 6, the keepers found the youngest wallaby, a five-month-old baby, lying in the small shed inside the enclosure where the group sheltered at night. It was soaked, muddy and dead. Outside the enclosure, the bins had been moved again. One had been rolled 50 metres uphill and placed upright beside the only section of the enclosure that was not electrified. The keepers took a look at the previous day's video tapes. </p> <p>They saw three small bony boys in baseball caps and hoods. Just before seven o'clock in the evening, an hour and a half after the zoo had closed, the boys walked casually up to the bin beside the wallaby enclosure, exchanged a few words, and climbed up and over. The footage was crude but two details were unmistakable: the boys' complete lack of furtiveness, and a fluency to their movements that showed they had done this before. </p> <p>Last month, two of the boys, both 11 years old, were convicted of cruelty to animals. Another boy, aged 10, who took part in the first attack on the wallabies but not the second, was also found guilty. Another boy, aged nine, who took part in the second attack, was too young to be prosecuted. Unusually for a case involving the conviction of children, the judge at Dudley Youth Court allowed the media to name the two oldest boys, citing \"the most serious form of cruelty\" performed by Ryan Jones and Kieron Anslow and their accomplices. </p> <p>The three boys found guilty were given 12-month behavioural orders and their families fined a total of \u00a31,100. Yet on leaving court, Jones and Anslow continued to play the part of amoral, uncontrollable children to perfection. Anslow, crop-haired with a precociously icy stare, gave the television cameras the finger. Jones, lankier and more excited, grinned, stuffed his mouth with food and showed no other emotions. </p> <p>In the narrow streets of Dudley, the week after the convictions, the zoo staff \"were being stopped every 100 yards,\" says Lewis, \"by people saying, 'They should hang the kids.'\" A petition against the boys was assembled. A local councillor and MP condemned them. The Home Office expressed concern. News of the wallaby killings reached Australia. On the internet, what had happened at Dudley grew from \"kicking\" and \"beating\", to \"abuse\" and \"mutilation\". A senior local police officer commented: \"Last year I dealt with eight murders in Dudley, but none of them attracted the attention this has.\" </p> <p>Yet if you talk to other people in Dudley, the sense of outrage is undercut a little by an admission. Breaking into the zoo is something of a local tradition. \"Listen to the old folk round here and they say everyone was at it,\" says Peter Suddock, the zoo's chief executive. \"It was a dare to get into the zoo over the fences at seven o'clock at night. We've all done things like that.\" In the early evening, the animals are at their most watchable and active and the dimming paths and enclosures at their most atmospheric - and there are other, less high-minded temptations. \"We've had children try to break into kiosks, take ice creams, trash things,\" says Lewis. \"They're crafty little buggers. They climb the trees to get in.\" </p> <p>Two years ago, razor wire was added to Dudley zoo's perimeter fence. But defending the maze of enclosures against all intruders is impossible. The zoo's resources are limited: it is almost 70 years old, and sections of it are showing their age or closed off altogether. In 2000, a dwarf crocodile was stolen. In 2001, two baby wallabies were snatched, again by children (not Anslow and Jones and their accomplices), who smashed through glass to reach them, again shortly after closing time. Those wallabies were found unharmed by police. No arrests followed. \"The children wanted them as pets,\" says Suddock. \"They didn't do anything to them.\" </p> <p>The story of this year's wallaby break-ins does not have the same children's story glow to it. All three of the boys convicted come from Kates Hill, a suburb near the centre of Dudley. Dudley is not a rich town - its heavy industry is gone, the shops in the centre are frugal or boarded-up - and Kates Hill is its most deprived area. Worn-looking semis and newer but neglected-looking council blocks cover a steep slope with lots of open space but few facilities. Boys hang around on bicycles, kick footballs without having a football pitch, sit on walls. Dudley police say Kates Hill has less crime than other parts of town, but in the local papers it has acquired a reputation for disorder regardless, particularly involving children and teenagers. </p> <p>At court, Anslow's mother said that her son had been mixing with a \"bad crowd\". The mother of the 10-year-old said the same. But the owner of one of the few shops on Kates Hill says that before the attacks on the wallabies, he thought of the three boys who would later be convicted as basically harmless. \"The kids seemed all right. I saw them every day when they came in to buy sweets. They respected me as the shop owner.\" </p> <p>Other people on the estate describe the boys, who are friends and go to the same school (which cannot be identified), in less benign terms. But they are keen not to be quoted. Only a few other facts about the boys escape these legal and social pressures to maintain their privacy. Anslow lives with his mother and four younger siblings. At court, his defence said his public manner was deceptive: at home he helped look after the family pets and give his youngest sibling a bottle. </p> <p>Jones also lives with his mother. He has five siblings, two of them with disabilities. The headmistress of his school was reportedly surprised as well as shocked when she heard what he and the others had done to the wallabies. </p> <p>On both occasions, the boys climbed the zoo perimeter a long way from their enclosure. From what the keepers can tell, and from the contradictory accounts the boys gave the police, the boys went straight to the wallabies. Once they got into the enclosure, they acted with increasing calculation. The first time, they drove the wallabies out of their night shelter by opening its tiny doors and banging on the sides of the shed. Then they chased the animals round their rectangular pen, about the size of half a tennis court, with its small bushes and trees and damp gravel. </p> <p>Wallabies can move fast and turn tight corners. But they are small - Dudley's are Parma wallabies, the smallest and most endangered kind, about the weight of a cat - and they are not frightening. \"If you pick them up by the tail, they can't do anything,\" Lewis says. The boys ran after the wallabies until they \"looked sad\" and were breathing heavily, then left the zoo the way they had come. </p> <p>The second time, they pulled up fencing that had been protecting the bushes in the wallaby enclosure, and used it to herd the animals into a corner. Then they picked up the smallest by the tail and threw it into the next enclosure, where there was a small concrete-lined pond. The baby wallaby \"needed a wash\", the boys decided, so they forced it in and out of the greenish water. It was a cold evening, but the boys stayed with the wallabies for 45 minutes. At some point the baby died, probably of shock. The boys put it back in the wallabies' night shelter, climbed out of the enclosure, and were found by the keepers on the other side of the zoo, rattling the fence round the lions. </p> <p>Cruelty to animals, at least of the informal kind, is a dark and tentatively explored subject. \"There's a paucity of evidence as to the psychology,\" says Michael Thrusfield of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh. His papers on animal abuse draw few conclusions, except that households that are violent in other ways are more likely to be involved, and that children are also \"over-represented\" among those who attack animals. \"You've only got to go down to a duck pond to see toddlers chasing ducks.\" </p> <p>Such actions are partly about power. In zoos, where animals are controlled so visibly, it may be that one sort of domination leads to another. Or it may be that cruelty is just one of many impulses triggered by the strange and suggestive environment of a zoo. In 2002, a teenager broke into Newquay zoo in Cornwall one night and tried to feed ice creams to the lions. Two years earlier, a rare type of lobster was stolen from the same zoo and its crate found beside the remains of a beach barbecue. </p> <p>In Dudley, one of the main pieces of evidence against the boys who attacked the wallabies was that they had bragged in front of one of Kates Hill's community policemen about how \"funny\" it was to have \"killed a kangaroo\". But now there is guarded optimism among those overseeing the programme to improve their behaviour: the boys are attending \"restorative\" meetings with the zoo staff, and are to do weekly menial tasks there as compensation. \"The kids want to get back to being kids again,\" says the head of Dudley's youth offending service, Mark Galikowski. It is best to interpret that positively.</p>",
  "<p>British industrial gases company BOC Group said it was upbeat about future demand for gas and that it expected further growth in this division as it reported a 5% increase yesterday in third-quarter profits. </p> <p>\"Our global gases businesses have continued to perform strongly,\" chief executive Tony Isaac said. \"Significant new contracts will add to future growth.\" </p> <p>The firm reported operating profits of \u00a3134m for the three months to the end of June on turnover of \u00a31.16bn. </p> <p>However, it said the negative effect of exchange rate movements, particularly the continued weakness of the American dollar, increased in the third quarter. </p> <p>The group said its BOC Edwards division, which supplies high-purity gas, vacuum pumps and other equipment to chipmakers, had performed well, with new equipment orders well ahead of a year ago - although below the previous quarter. </p> <p>BOC Edwards has been riding a revival in capital spending among customers such as Intel and Samsung Electronics after nearly three years of an industry downturn.</p>",
  "<p>For a couple of years - and even after the pop from the dotcom bubble - Egg looked like the smartest thing in financial services. A combination of generous savings rates and cheap credit cards was a serious challenge to the unwritten rule of banking industry: that customers are mostly too lazy to move accounts. Egg was a sexy business. </p> <p>If Prudential had sold at that point, it would have been accused of failing to exploit the brand's potential. </p> <p>What it did instead - sell a minority stake via flotation - now looks like the worst possible decision. </p> <p>Egg's management got a whiff of freedom and trotted off to France, a notoriously tricky and closed market. The losses reached \u00a3280m by the time the Pru finally ruled that was more than un oeuf. </p> <p>Exiting France was meant to help the auction, but yesterday that was abandoned as well. Pru's chief executive, Jonathan Bloomer, is obviously correct in refusing to sell at a knock-down price, but in doing so has set himself a major challenge. </p> <p>He needs to demonstrate that Egg can still create value. </p> <p>It has swallowed a decent-sized chunk of Pru's capital and, post-France, it is far from clear that the cash couldn't have been better deployed in the core business. </p> <p>Any more bad news from Egg - like a slowdown in Britain - and the whispers over Bloomer's future will grow louder. </p> <p>Chief executives collecting more than \u00a31m a year are paid not to squander golden eggs. </p> <p><strong> Shareholder power </strong><br> </p> <p>If you agreed, verbally, to sell an asset at a specified price but then found that the asset had soared in value by the time you were ready to sign the sale contract, would you feel duty-bound to complete the sale at the lower price? </p> <p>Or would you negotiate a new, higher price? </p> <p>Directors at the nuclear power business, British Energy, the government and all the bondholders now lined up against American hedge fund Polygon, reckon you should do the former - take the lower proceeds - because that is what you had originally agreed. </p> <p>Last year, with wholesale electricity prices at or below the cost of production, British Energy was more or less bust - except that it could not be allowed to go bust, because it runs nuclear plants. So the government threw money at the problem while a corporate workout was put together: equity hold ers would be diluted out of sight by the debt providers, who would take over direct ownership while the government would receive a portion of profits in return for its financial health. </p> <p>But with this being a messy rescue involving millions in state funds, the deal is still awaiting regulatory clearance before shareholders can vote on the matter in autumn. And since the structure of the original deal was agreed last October, wholesale prices have doubled. </p> <p>All of a sudden, British Energy is a rather valuable, cash-producing enterprise. Which is why Polygon has built a 5.6% stake and is now demanding that shareholders retain far more ownership of the continuing British Energy business than the 2.5% envisaged in last year's rescue plan. </p> <p>Polygon is being painted as the villain in all of this. It is an opportunistic investor - a hedge fund, in fact (hiss). It built its stake in British Energy secretly by using contracts for difference, a com mon form of derivative (hiss some more). And it seems to have previously held bonds in British Energy and may well have voted in favour of the original restructuring deal which it is now trying to undermine (outrage!). </p> <p>Yet it is hard to quibble with Polygon's logic. Shareholders lacked power when last year's deal was being put together, since it was assumed that unless the bondholders supported the company British Energy would go into administration and shareholders would lose everything. But those shareholders have now been re-energised, since their company has been revived by rising prices. While they are still in a position to make their muscle felt, shareholders should use it - aggressively. </p> <p><strong> A tale of two deficits </strong><br> </p> <p> Much has been made over recent weeks of the role of company pension funds in takeover battles. </p> <p>The pension fund deficit at WH Smith scuppered the planned acquisition of the chain by Permira. The Marks &amp; Spencer rumble with Philip Green showed us how pension fund trustees might be able to demand higher contributions from the underlying business if that business is being asked to shoulder greater risks, such as heavy debts. </p> <p>Yesterday's report from consulting actuaries Lane Clark &amp; Peacock showed us 10 British companies that may well be \"bid-proof\" because of the size of their pension fund deficits. </p> <p>But the real eye-catcher was among Lane Clark's pan-European figures. </p> <p>Topping this shameful list, with a \u20ac9.4bn (\u00a36.2bn) deficit, is Santander, the putative bidder for our own Abbey National. Clearly, pension issues at home don't matter if you are expanding abroad using freshly minted paper. In fact, since Abbey's deficit stands at \u00a31.1bn, the effect of a takeover would be to dilute the Spaniard's problems.</p>",
  "Screaming passengers on some of the world's scariest white-knuckle rides may have to be told to whisper in terror after a legal ruling yesterday. <p>The owners of Alton Towers, the theme park set in the heart of the Staffordshire countryside, have until November to come up with a plan to cut the noise from its rides, firework displays, concerts and public address systems after a private prosecution by a couple living 100 yards from the entrance. </p> <p>District judge Timothy Gascoigne found Tussaud's Theme Parks Ltd guilty of statutory noise nuisance under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. </p> <p>In his judgment, he told how he had visited the ivy-clad cottage of Suzanne and Stephen Roper, who bought their home in the village of Farley 12 years before the first rollercoaster was built. </p> <p>The first big thrill was the Corkscrew, with its heart-stopping upside-down disorientating moments; then came Nemesis, with its reputation for lost shoes and G-forces of up to four; and Air with its \"true feeling of flight, liberation and exhilaration\". </p> <p>But the judge bypassed those to concentrate on Oblivion, the world's first vertical drop rollercoaster. He visited the Ropers' garden and said he could clearly hear Oblivion's screamers. </p> <p>\"The fundamental problem with Oblivion seems to me is its design,\" he said. \"The ride stops just over the edge of the drop. It then plummets vertically into a hole in the ground before coming out of the tunnel to rise again to the starting point. </p> <p>\"Obviously the 'don't look down' message played as the car hangs over the edge is designed to heighten the white knuckle effect. This induces screaming. I find that the screams and mechanical noise is intrusive and constitutes a nuisance.\" </p> <p>He also found that noise associated with a corporate event organised for employees of BT, featuring live bands, had ruined a weekend when Mr Roper and his wife were trying to relax in their garden with guests. </p> <p>At an earlier hearing, Mr Roper, who runs a china company in Stoke-on-Trent, said he had never known a day like the Sunday of the BT event. \"I heard the whole of the speech made by the chairman of BT, Sir Christopher Bland,\" he told the court. \"He might as well have been sitting next to me.\" </p> <p>Of the park's firework displays, the judge said: \"I find [they] are intrusive ... In context, Alton Towers, in a conservation area, aims to set off the loudest fireworks in Britain.\" </p> <p>Mr Roper had said of the displays: \"If you live within, I would suggest, a mile or any more of Alton Towers, your windows literally shake, and if you go outside, the ground shakes.\" </p> <p>But Judge Gascoigne did not accept that traffic noise was a nuisance attributable to Alton Towers. He did not serve a noise abatement order on the park, but has scheduled a two-day hearing on November 1 to hear submissions about the detail of any order that might be served. </p> <p>Outside the court, Mr Roper said: \"We are delighted after 25 years of misery. We hope now we can work with Alton Towers as good neighbours in the future.\" </p> <p>\"It's been difficult, miserable at times and nightmarish at others,\" added Mrs Roper </p> <p>In a statement their solicitor, Richard Buxton, said: \"It has never been our intention to close down Alton Towers, but after 25 years of escalating noise we seek a level of civilised behaviour.\" </p> <p>The Ropers' barrister, Martin Diggins, added: \"The case is a historic victory for the little guy against the giant corporation and for the environment in general.\" </p> <p>An Alton Towers spokeswoman said the judgment did not mean that the park might close. </p> <p>\"Alton Towers is naturally very disappointed with this verdict and we will now consider the implications of the judgment whilst we work towards a compromise solution that is acceptable to all parties,\" said a statement from the company. </p> <p>\"However, we are a theme park and it is inevitable that there will be some noise associated with our business. </p> <p>\"We do not believe that this decision is representative of the level of actual complaints received, or the feelings of the majority of our local residents.\"</p>",
  "US investigators researching illnesses suffered by veterans of the first Gulf war yesterday insisted that all troops and civilians in the area might have been exposed to low levels of chemical agents. <p>Material was blasted into the environment by bombing attacks on Iraqi chemical plants and munition centres during the war, and by demolition by allied forces afterwards, witnesses told Lord Lloyd's independent inquiry into claims by British veterans that they had been made ill by their service. </p> <p>None of the witnesses from US congressional investigations attempted to quantify the exact levels of exposure, but Robert Haley, from the University of Texas, who has both examined veterans and studied animal experiments, is today expected to say that low-level agents do in fact cause detectable brain injuries. </p> <p>\"All persons in the theatre may have been exposed,\" said Keith Rhodes, chief technologist for the government accountability office (GAO), an investigating arm of the US Congress. </p> <p>The GAO said recently that the US government's models for assessing the number of soldiers who might have been exposed to agents from the plume caused by the destruction of a weapons bunker at Khamisayah, in southern Iraq, after the war could not be supported. The US government estimated that just over 100,000 US troops may have been exposed, and the Ministry of Defence in Britain has admitted that 9,000 British troops may have been exposed. </p> <p>But Dr Rhodes said: \"The concern for you all is that your MoD completely relied on [US] department of defence modelling, so any estimation of exposure, or any estimation of concentration of material, or any estimation of who was or who was not under the plume, is at the mercy of the department of defence model.\" </p> <p>He added that Dr Haley's work was showing \"physiological damage to veterans as a result of low-level exposure\". </p> <p>James Tuite, an adviser to an earlier investigation of Gulf war illnesses, said that there was growing credible scientific experience, in addition to substantial anecdotal evidence, that \"sub-acute levels of airborne chemical warfare agents were present within the theatre of operations\". </p> <p>About 14,000 chemical agent alarms deployed by US forces sounded on average two to three times a day \"for a total of approximately 42,000 alarms per day for 42 days\" - up to 1.76m alarms during the war. Yet the US department of defence asserted all were false alarms, and argued that exposure to chemical weapons for unprotected people was \"painful, debilitating and often deadly\". There had been no such effects seen in the Gulf, the US government had said. </p> <p>Christopher Shays, a Republican who chairs the congressional sub-committee on the issue, said in a written submission to the Lloyd inquiry that the GAO study was significant. \"Caught using bad science to support worse policies, the department of defence can no longer defend the proposition veterans' illnesses are not related to battlefield exposures. We shared that battlefield with British troops. The GAO findings have profound implications for them, and for civilian populations in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iran.\" </p> <p>Bernie Sanders, an independent member of the House of Representatives from Vermont, said: \"To say to someone who is ill, who may be dying, who cannot go to work ... because we do not understand your illness, we cannot compensate you, or that you are different from someone whose war wound we understand, is very upsetting.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russian oil company Yukos received some rare good news yesterday with an extension to the deadline for its tax bill and a court ruling overturning the bailiffs' seizure of 6.7bn roubles (\u00a3126m) last month. </p> <p>Even the company's warning that it will not be able to pay the $3.4bn (\u00a31.86bn) tax bill from 2000 on time did not stop shares in Yukos surging on Russian markets yesterday. </p> <p>The shares climbed on both the RTS Russian trade index and the Micex interbank currency exchange. Yukos finished up 15.89% on the RTS, while the Micex suspended trading of the stock for an hour after it surged 15.2% ahead of Friday's close, eventually finishing up 10.54%. But analysts warned that the good news is likely to be short-lived. </p> <p>Yesterday, the tax ministry notified Yukos that it was beginning an audit of the company for 2002. The company is facing a tax bill of $3.3bn for 2001, and the ministry has warned that more bills are expected for subsequent years. </p> <p>\"In an environment where you have an unending stream of negative news, a small ruling in favour of Yukos looks quite positive,\" said Alexander Kim, an equity strategist with Renaissance Capital brokerage. \"So far I don't think anything has changed fundamentally.\" </p> <p>On Friday, Andrei Belyakov, head of the justice ministry's bailiff service, confirmed that Yukos has until the end of August to pay the remainder of the bill. </p> <p>The company had said it would pay $1.3bn by the end of July; Mr Belyakov on Friday said that total payments so far had amounted to $690m. </p> <p>The company's core produc tion unit, Yugansk, is expected to be seized and sold if the bill is not paid. The Interfax news agency reported Mr Belyakov as saying: \"We made it quite clear that it is pointless to make excuses to slow the repayment of the debt.\" </p> <p>The Yukos press secretary, Alexander Shadrin, said that while the company intends to pay the debt as soon as possible, one month is not enough. \"Yukos does not have enough money available,\" he said. </p> <p>The rare court ruling in Yukos's favour yesterday overturned the seizure of 6.7bn roubles as an enforcement writ - essentially a bailiff's fee - last month. \"The only positive thing you can say is that Yukos won a court case, which it doesn't often do. It would be nice if they won one that really mattered,\" said Stephen O'Sullivan, co-managing director of research at United Financial Services brokerage. </p> <p>New attempts at talks between Yukos and the government are also said to be under way. Last week Group Menatep, Yukos's holding company, confirmed the involvement of Jean Chretien, the former Canadian prime minister, as a mediator in the dispute.</p>",
  "<p>Larry Elliot is right to warn against early celebration of a \"breakthrough\" in the Doha trade round (What WTO needs is a new Reformation, August 2). The talks originally collapsed in Cancun because of the refusal of the rich countries to implement the reforms of the global trade system they had promised in Doha. This \"development\" agenda is itself just a first step in creating a truly fair and equitable trade system - but the US and EU lacked the political will to implement even that minimal programme. </p> <p>What is conspicuously absent from this agreement is any commitment by the rich countries to implement change now. All we have is an offer to carry on talking with the rich willing to share no more than a few crumbs from their table to help the world's starving.<br><strong>Louise Richards</strong><br>Chief executive, War on Want </p> <p>Why does Larry Elliott think that the World Trade Organisation has to choose between being democratic and being efficient? He would never say the same thing about Westminster. </p> <p>There are other sources of democratic legitimacy than just the presence of national governments at the negotiating table. If the WTO is to adopt more majority voting among its member states or a cabinet system of some sort, as the arguments in favour of efficiency tend to suggest, then these other sources of legitimacy will become even more important. </p> <p>First among them should be a parliamentary assembly to meet in public so citizens can see what is going on. Democracy should mean government of the people, by the people, for the people, not of trade negotiators, by trade negotiators, for trade negotiators.<br><strong>Richard Laming</strong><br>Director, Federal Union </p> <p>Larry Elliott is quite right to call for reform of the WTO. But the problem with the current organisation is not simply the Byzantine way in which deals are done. Of course, the secrecy and rituals of WTO negotiations are outdated and undemocratic. Developing countries are bullied and citizens' groups are banned. And yes, this structure allows the rich countries to practise protectionism while preaching open markets. </p> <p>But there is an even more fundamental problem in the doctrine the WTO preaches - it doesn't provide the solutions to the problems of global trade. Liberal capitalism and free trade will not solve global poverty, any more than they will protect the natural resources on which so much trade depends. </p> <p>So yes, let's see total reform of the WTO. We still need multilateral trade negotiations - but the objective should be trade justice and not free trade.<br><strong>Liana Stupples</strong><br>Policy and campaigns director, Friends of the Earth </p> <p>WTO negotiations could also be compared to a midnight poker game in a flash but seedy casino. WTO players behave as if they are engaging in a zero-sum game. They talk of \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" interests; \"gains\" and \"concessions\" are exchanged, and the negotiations are conducted like a game of poker, where the negotiator's hand is not revealed until late in the game. Fine for poker - but bad for the international community. </p> <p>We are often led by governments and policy-makers to believe that trade is not a zero-sum game and that the results are mutually beneficial for the world's 6 billion consumers. This could be achieved, but only if the whole culture of WTO negotiations were to change - to make it more \"catholic\" for everyone.<br><strong>Robin Simpson</strong><br>Senior policy adviser, Consumers International</p>",
  "<p>US investment bank Goldman Sachs effectively took control of debt-ridden British hotel chain Queens Moat yesterday, offering to buy its junior debt and outstanding shares in a deal worth \u00a3544m. </p> <p>Goldman, which made the offer through its Whitehall global real estate fund, said holders of 41% of the group's junior debt had agreed the deal, which values the debt at 90p in the pound. </p> <p>Whitehall already owns 34% of Queens Moat's junior debt, bringing its stake to 75%. </p> <p>In a joint statement, Whitehall said it would give the remaining junior debtholders until August 16 to accept the offer. It needed 98% acceptances for the deal to pass. </p> <p>\"It would be unusual if the other holders didn't follow the steering committee,\" said one source, referring to the committee which held the 41% debt stake. </p> <p>In addition, Whitehall said it agreed to pay shareholders a penny a share, which ensures the group stays afloat rather than falling into administration, which had been one likely outcome. </p> <p>\"The Queens Moat board believes the acquisition is the best option available to the company and is recommending it to its shareholders,\" the board said in the statement. </p> <p>The deal brings to an end months of wrangling between Queens Moat and its junior creditors. Since the early 1990s the hotel group has been in financial trouble, which led to its delisting in 1995 for two years. Its troubles were compounded by the tourism downturn during the three-year economic slowdown and the September 11 attacks in America. </p> <p>As part of a restructuring to cut the firm's debt and speed up the sale process, its senior lenders - which hold about \u00a3220m of the company's debt - had already agreed to receive 110p for every \u00a31 of debt. </p> <p>The junior debt holders - which hold about \u00a3230m of debt - had not agreed terms and were hoping to strike a deal with Queens Moat following a sale to bidders for its assets in Germany, Britain and the Netherlands. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley, which was advising Queens Moat on its restructuring, had drawn up the short list of preferred bidders but at the 11th hour, Goldman Sachs's Whitehall swooped in and made an offer for the whole group. </p> <p>Given its 34% junior debt holding and an equity stake of 29%, Whitehall effectively had the power to block any deal to the bidders. </p> <p>Whitehall's original deal valued the debt at 85p in the pound but after weeks of wrangling, the real estate fund agreed to raise its offer to 90p, sources said. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs advised Whitehall while Close Brothers advised the junior debt holders.</p>",
  "<p>It is getting dark in Aden, and Theguardian, trailing a long sword through the dirt on the edge of a mean village of barns and lean-tos, is fed up and a little bored. The rough tracks through the trees are littered with the corpses of goblins which Theguardian has slain for want of anything else to do. In truth, they are easy kills, and slaying anyone does not correspond to good journalistic practice. But Theguardian, my avatar, has spent a real hour in a nonexistent world with more than four million paying residents, and nobody has been willing to talk to him so far. </p> <p>Broad-shouldered men with jackboots and flowing capes dash across the mud. Barbie-doll elven women in pink miniskirts and bra tops loiter by the woodsheds. Each of these electronic incarnations on the screen represents an actual person somewhere in the world. The real individual could be anywhere on the globe. Here, they are all Adenites. </p> <p>For no clear reason, an elf woman starts beating Theguardian with a sword. Tapping away at the keyboard, I try to explain that I am not, as I appear to be, a novice knight with the build of an American footballer in silver plate armour, dragging a sword the size of a broom handle, but a reporter in London. The elf woman stops attacking me and, without a word, teleports away into nothingness. This keeps happening. But I must persist. This is not an abstract electronic quest. This is not about points on a scoreboard or racing for a finish line. This is about money. </p> <p>Most of us are familiar with the idea of conventional computer games: you buy, borrow or steal a piece of software for a desktop computer or a PlayStation-like console, load it up, and use a keyboard or mouse or joystick to steer a character through a challenge. You race a car round a course, or run a football team, or kill monsters, or slay gunmen. The game ends: you start again, or buy another. You can play with a friend, or with a few friends over the internet - but it's still a game that ends and, for those dissatisfied with reality as it is, that's not good enough. </p> <p>Now, most notably in east Asia but increasingly in the US and Europe, another kind of computer game is gaining ground which, financially and emotionally, blurs the boundary between the real and the computer-generated. In the software business, the games go by the indigestible acronym MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games), but they are more easily understood as virtual worlds. Aden is a virtual world in an online game called Lineage, created and run by a Korean company, NCsoft. Lineage's four million mainly east Asian subscribers make it the biggest, although the more recent Japanese virtual world of Vana'diel, in the game Final Fantasy XI, which has a large following in the US and is about to launch in Britain, recently passed the 500,000-inhabitant mark. </p> <p>The most curious element of the virtual worlds is not the fortunes they are making for their creators, though these are real and remarkable enough; NCSoft's profits run at \u00a35m a month: unlike conventional computer games, which players pay for only once, virtual world residents pay a monthly fee, typically about \u00a310, for the right to stay alive in these privately run existences. </p> <p>No, what is most bizarre about the virtual worlds, in which all players were supposed to start out equal and acquire wealth and status by their own efforts, is that the inequality of the real world is sluicing into them. Players who are wealthy in the real world are using real money to buy virtual goods and virtual characters from players who are real-world poor. Players who, in the real world, are time-rich and cash-poor are putting in hours of graft in the virtual world, killing virtual monsters, seeking out virtual treasure and giving themselves IT worker's lumbago to produce nonexistent magical weapons and characters, which can then be sold for thousands of dollars on the internet. </p> <p>At first encounter, the virtual-world concept seems simple - an ingenious merger between two familiar PC-age institutions: the fantasy role-playing game and the internet chatroom. At any one time, thousands of people are online in the same virtual world as you, dressed up as magicians or dwarves. Sometimes you chat to each other, sometimes you try to kill each other, sometimes you gang up to fight another gang for control of a castle. Sometimes you sit on someone's lap and talk. </p> <p>But just as you are more likely to be killed if you are poorly equipped and inexperienced, so you are less likely to be chatted to and invited to join a gang if you are poorly equipped and inexperienced. In order to get equipment and experience, it is necessary to carry out dull, repetitive tasks, like slaying goblins, or testing your sword against a training post. </p> <p>With my ridiculous armoury in the twilight squalor of small-town Aden, as the novice knight Theguardian, I begin to have a strange, familiar feeling. As I hack away, clicking the cursor over and over again and watching Theguardian's claymore wearily whacking a virtual straw dummy, I start to think: \"This is not a game. This is not fun. This is hard, dull work.\" The virtual Protestant in me thinks: \"If I don't do this, I won't get anywhere in this world.\" At which point I think: \"Couldn't I pay someone else to do it for me while I go and do something more worthwhile?\" </p> <p>This is exactly the point at which the virtual and real worlds collide. A US economist, Edward Castronova, who spent months roaming the virtual world of Norrath in Sony's game EverQuest, used exchange rates based on black market internet prices for virtual goods, virtual money and pre-developed characters to calculate that Norrath's real-world GNP per capita makes it wealthier, citizen for citizen, than China or India. </p> <p>He found that almost a third of adult subscribers spend more time in Norrath in a typical week than they do working for pay in the real world. He writes: \"One can almost believe that many people do live there, wherever it is, and not on earth.\" </p> <p>Officially, the companies that run the virtual worlds don't approve of the selling for real money of virtual items: according to their rules, players who are caught doing it will be kicked out. Lance Stites, of NCsoft's US subsidiary in Texas, points out that if the firm acknowledged a real value for unreal things, it could face legal action from players. \"If something's got real-world value at some point, we've got an obligation,\" he says. </p> <p>Yet the buying and selling of online goods and avatars is being carried out so brazenly that it is hard to believe the corporations are as worried as they claim. A Hong Kong-based company, IGE Ltd, employs 50 people exclusively in buying and selling nonexistent wands, weapons, cloaks and virtual currency from virtual worlds such as EverQuest. Another firm, Team VIP, will sell you 10m adena - the virtual currency in use in Lineage - for 250 real US dollars. A third site, <a href=\"http://www.mysupersales.com\">mysupersales.com</a>, offers EverQuest \"spider venom\" for $699.30. The venom isn't real, nor are its effects, and, more intriguingly, any \"advantage\" that the buyer might gain from using it would seem to be confined entirely to the microcircuits of a humming server in San Diego, California. </p> <p>Mysupersales.com specialises in selling avatars - virtual characters which a subscriber has brought to in-game wealth and power at the expense of real-world advantages, such as a social life. One recent avatar being sold was a level 74 magician for Final Fantasy XI. The asking price, for a collection of numbers in a computer that will never exist outside a fantasy world, was $1,299.99. </p> <p>If it seems extraordinary that anyone would consider paying the best part of \u00a3700 for a virtual magician, you are unfamiliar with the lurid tales of the addictiveness of virtuality. EverQuest is popularly known as \"Evercrack\" among hardcore Norrathians. \"The sad truth is that, in many ways, EverQuest is better than real life,\" an anonymous 36-year-old woman player told a US psychological researcher, Nicholas Yee. \"It is easier to succeed in EQ, I can be beautiful, fit and healthy in EQ - in real life I am chronically ill and there isn't much fun or achievement to be had.\" </p> <p>Some date the origin of virtual worlds to the dawn of the internet itself, pointing to the work of a group of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-obsessed students at Essex University in 1979, led by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle. They were the first to work out how their simple text-based computer fantasy games could be played simultaneously by multiple players around the world, linked by early international computer networks. </p> <p>For the next two decades, however, the increase in the power of home computers outpaced the increase in the speed of the internet that connected them. Only recently, with the widespread availability of cheap, fast internet connections - broadband - has it become possible for thousands of players, thousands of miles apart, to talk, band together and overcome the same virtual challenges, in the same vividly created virtual world, at the same time. </p> <p>South Korea has led the world in broadband access, and most of the four million players of Lineage are Korean. It was in Korea last year that a 22-year-old man, identified by JoonAng Daily as Mr Jin, was arrested for playing the new version of Lineage, Lineage 2, in an internet cafe without paying. He started playing the game on November 29 and was finally dragged from the computer on December 17, 438 hours and 38 minutes later. Police reported that he had not washed during that time. </p> <p>According to the Korean national police agency's Cyber Terror Response Centre, 70% of crimes committed by young people are related to virtual worlds, mostly attempts to steal virtual money and virtual items. In October 2002 a 24-year-old man, Kim Kyung-jae, died of a DVT-like illness after playing an online game, Mu, virtually nonstop for three and a half days. \"I told him not to spend so much time on the internet,\" his mother told the BBC. \"He just said, 'Yes, Mum', but kept on playing.\" (According to Lance Stites of NCsoft the company has taken steps to encourage players to keep the distinction between real and virtual worlds clear. Now, messages appear periodically on screen reminding subscribers to \"stretch your legs and see the sunshine once in a while\".) </p> <p>The lure of the virtual worlds is not difficult to understand. They resemble real life in that there is no specific, common goal, no \"game over\". There are quests, tasks, narratives, but the game continues when and whether these are completed. The only remaining goal, then, is to find out why you are there in the first place; and because, unlike real life, the gods, the bureaucrats and the bosses are one and the same, there is a sense that one day you might actually be told the meaning of virtual life, that the grand design might be revealed. \"A competition has arisen between earth and the virtual worlds,\" writes Castronova, \"and for many, earth is the lesser option.\" </p> <p>Back in Aden, I have made some progress. I have reached a larger, busier town, where other player characters are crying out their wares for sale. SELLING KILLER RABBIT keeps scrolling through my message box. That is one of the intelligible cries. Mostly it sounds like the pit of a futures exchange. A squat green creature going by the name of Yogurt is screaming over and over: \"49 brings 105 rough 132 iron.\" Yogurt agrees to talk. \"Let me get dressed,\" he says, and returns a few moments later in the form of a black-robed wizard with a blue light on the end of a stick. Lineage, Yogurt explains, allows players to disguise themselves as monsters once they reach a certain level, hence his homunculus disguise. </p> <p>In real life, Yogurt the wizard is a 26-year-old American, hunched over a computer in Okinawa, Japan, at one in the morning (it's mid-afternoon in London). Yogurt won't tell me what he does for a real-world living, although almost all the young American males in Okinawa are serving members of the US military. He could be tall, short, fat, thin, spotty, black, white. He could be a she. (About half the male players in EverQuest and a quarter of the females have at least one avatar of the opposite sex.) All I know is that in the real world Yogurt is unable to cast spells and will never meet a Zombie Lord of Fear. Yogurt has inhabited the virtual world of Aden for six years. </p> <p>I ask where all the Koreans are. Yogurt points out a peculiarity of the virtual worlds: that their vast subscriber populations are divided up over a number of different servers. Each contains the same virtual world, with the same landscape, magic and monsters, but each has a different set of players. The Koreans have Korean-language Adens; we are on a server that provides an English-language Aden. Each server can deal with about 5,000 players at one time. </p> <p>\"The Korean servers are very overpopulated, from what I hear,\" says Yogurt. \"I kind of like it here. It's nice and relaxing.\" Behind us there are scenes of terrible carnage involving elves, magicians, giant spiders and a group of characters who look like sumo wrestlers. The clash of weapons sounds from the speakers and the screen flashes with explosions. Another giant spider and a werewolf cut across our path, a disembodied eye shimmies through the air, the fighting continues and a wizard makes it snow. Is it always like this? \"No,\" says Yogurt. \"Just when 12-year-olds get bored.\" </p> <p>Yogurt is a member of one of the gangs of players - known as blood pledges in Lineage - which are a feature of the virtual worlds. Some two dozen people, unlikely to meet each other in reality, unite their avatars to kill monsters, win status and wealth, take a virtual house in a virtual town together and go on virtual picnics in the virtual countryside. \"It's the people who make it fun. The game itself is boring. It always has been,\" says Yogurt. </p> <p>Yogurt and another member of his pledge, Slowmotion, whose real self is in Miami, take Theguardian on a teleport tour of Aden. We go into a bar in a virtual town called Giran. The place is empty. It is impossible to drink virtual beer anyway. Nor can we sit down. \"My legs don't bend,\" says Yogurt. </p> <p>Yogurt and Slowmotion take me to a cathedral where characters can get virtually married. \"This is another aspect of the game that I frankly think is dumb, but come on in,\" says Yogurt, and we walk inside a conventional Christian space with rows of pews facing an altar. \"This guy says blah blah blah, you may now f_ck that bi_ch,\" says Slowmotion, a busy, fidgety avatar whose current form is a green dwarf but who acts and talks like South Park's Eric Cartman. </p> <p>The last stop is a place called Lawful Temple, a pool in a forest where characters can learn spells. Slowmotion dashes off after a wild boar that has crossed his field of vision and slays it. Yogurt and I are hanging out by the pool. A certain street-corner aimlessness infuses the mood, and a certain bitterness - virtual politics, of a kind. Yogurt has already told me how much he hates the new version of Lineage, which has drawn some of his pledge buddies away into another world where he no longer meets them. Old-time virtual-world inhabitants grumble about the capitalist-bureaucrat gods who control their virtual existence. The players are the ones who have devoted great tracts of their real lives to the game; but ultimately the game belongs to the corporations, not the players. They can break up old worlds by luring players into new ones. Ultimately, they can close down a world altogether, killing the last die- hard inhabitants - and all their years of toil and emotional investment - with the flick of a switch. </p> <p>\"Is this going to go on for ever, you and this game?\" asks Theguardian. </p> <p>\"Well, I pay $15 a month, about two times the cost of a movie ticket,\" says Yogurt. </p> <p>\"Are you worried they might close this world down one day?\" </p> <p>\"Nope.\" </p> <p>My screen is small, and it is hard to see the Lawful Temple with the bright afternoon light coming in from the London street outside. It's just before noon in Florida but in Okinawa, in the darkness in the small hours of the morning, the virtual trees in the virtual forest around the virtual ornamental pool must look more vivid than \"RL\", as hardcore online players call real life. \"Lineage isn't reality?\" asks Yogurt rhetorically. He looks around, by typing \"(looks round)\", and laughs, by typing \"hehe\". I think he means that it is. </p>",
  "<p>Leaders of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) today gave fire authorities formal notice of their intention to ballot members on industrial action, after talks to end the long-running firefighters' pay dispute collapsed. </p> <p>Ballot papers will be sent out next week and the vote is expected to run through the rest of August.</p> <p>The spectre of strike action follows a confusing end to yesterday's talks, when FBU representatives were left waiting as employers failed to return to the table. </p> <p>Union chiefs and local authority employers had been scheduled to sign a proposal to pay the final two stages of a deal that ended the bitter strikes of 2002 and 2003. </p> <p>Firefighters would have received a 3.5% pay rise outstanding since last November and a 4.2% rise from July 1. </p> <p>The 4.2% pay rise was dependent on the Audit Commission verifying that changes to modernising the force, agreed as part of the overall deal, were being carried out.</p> <p>The public service watchdog delivered its findings last Friday in a second report on modernisation distributed to stakeholders. </p> <p>The Audit Commission admitted that the progress report, commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, would remain unpublished.</p> <p>As well as the 4.2% rise, transitional funding worth \u00a330m is at stake, which will only be released subject to employers' confidence in the progress of modernisation to date.</p> <p>But councils have yet to decide whether the progress report shows satisfactory progress and so have not yet given the green light.</p> <p>While the FBU lauded the report as showing that \"all but a handful of fire brigades in England and Wales\" had showed significant progress, fire authority bosses claimed the report's findings required \"careful consideration\".</p> <p>A Local Government Association spokesman admitted the report's findings were the \"sticking point\" over agreeing to the 4.2%. \"It is not such a clean bill of health that you can rubber-stamp it,\" he said. \"It needs careful consideration and that is what we are doing urgently\", he added.</p> <p>Confusion reigned surrounding yesterday's talks in central London. Employers claimed the talks had ended after the FBU rejected an offer, while the union said that its members were still waiting to reconvene and discuss the issue. </p> <p>The FBU accused the government \"wrecking\" the deal, claiming that previous talks had ended successfully last week and that no hint of a problem had been signalled to the union. </p> <p>An FBU spokesman said: \"The only sticking point - stand down time - had been resolved by both sides last Tuesday. The union had agreed to a form of words, proposed by the employers, which they rejected today. No problems were raised between then and the talks today.\" </p> <p>The spokesman claimed the employers had met prior to both sides getting together, and that its members - \"packed\" with a \"wrecking crew\" of London Labour party councillors instructed to scupper the deal - had voted 13 to 10 against accepting the agreement. </p> <p>When the main talks were finally held, the employers walked out during an adjournment and refused to meet for another six weeks. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister flatly rejected the claims. \"It is nonsense for the FBU to say that government has intervened in any way at all. The government has taken no part in these negotiations. </p> <p>\"We have always made it clear that we are prepared to provide transitional funding to support the agreement that resulted in modernisation. The deal was agreed by the employers and the union in June last year.\"</p> <p>The Audit Commission said that a full report on fire service modernisation would be produced in the autumn.</p>",
  "<p>Self-harmers are being failed by the NHS. At least, that is what the National Institute of Clinical Excellence said last week. It also announced that staff should be given special training on the needs of self-harmers. I am not convinced. </p> <p>It strikes me that people who hurt themselves deliberately, or who try to kill themselves and then come to hospital seeking help, are the victims of many wrongs - bad relationships, unemployment, poverty, mental illness and addictions - but they are not the victims of bad healthcare. They get their wounds stitched, their overdoses treated and a psychiatric review, time and again. They get kindness and endless patience from tired, busy staff. </p> <p>Where I work, I see young people who have taken huge overdoses get liver transplants, followed by months of intensive care, costing thousands of pounds a day. The NHS is one of the few institutions to give self-harmers every chance. We treat them as we treat everyone else: that is, to the best of our ability. The fact that the panel handing down this indictment was headed by a psychiatrist makes it all the harder to swallow. Any A&amp;E doctor could tell you that in psychiatry, crisis management means rolling up at 10am the next morning, latte in hand, when the blood and vomit have been cleared away and the patient is no longer drunk and abusive. </p> <p>In my current job, in addition to the people with heart attacks, gastro-intestinal haemorrhages, strokes, tumours and blood clots to the lung, I cover a whole ward full of patients who have taken overdoses or slit their wrists - about 12 each night. These patients have been medically stabilised and are waiting for a psychiatric review in the morning. What we lack on the front line is not understanding: it's time. When you are on your own trying to prevent an elderly lady from bleeding to death, it's hard to keep your temper when you are being hassled to prescribe a drug for a girl who is itchy because she has taken a methadone overdose. That is what happens when you take a lot of morphine - you itch. </p> <p>In order for doctors and nurses to have more time for each patient, one of two things has to happen: fewer people have to come to hospital, or more of us need to be on duty. It is hard not to get frustrated: people who self-harm do have a choice, although it may not seem like it at the time. They could not do it, or they could do it and stay at home to deal with the consequences. Just please don't lacerate yourself, come to hospital and then complain about it. A&amp;E is an emergency service. One imagines that people who repeatedly set fire to their own houses and then called the fire brigade would get short shrift, no matter what their mental state. Self-harmers who attend hospital habitually are unable to take responsibility for their own lives and actions, and it might be that by being so patient and non-judgmental we are fostering that destructive cycle. </p> <p>Any doctor who doesn't sometimes privately think that, is no longer working at the coal face - perhaps they are spending time sitting on panels. Naturally, I understand that to say it publicly is highly controversial. I can see well-meaning liberals up and down the country spluttering into their morning coffee: \"Have you seen this, darling? Goodness, they really do need extra training!\" Judge me after you've walked a mile in my shoes, or even run around in them for 24 hours. </p> <p>Misery is invisible. In the context of western biomedicine, and our society at large, the objective is valued over the subjective, the solid over the intangible, and the body over the mind. The pain felt by people desperate enough to take a kitchen knife to their own neck, falls into the latter categories. They are the voiceless. By translating their mental torment into raw flesh wounds they come to our attention. But the fault lies with a society in which one in 10 young people are driven to harm themselves, not with the people who care for them in the middle of the night. That one doctor who is a little tired and distracted in the small hours of the morning is at the very end of a long line of failure, cruelty and disappointment in that patient's life. Just because he is there to help does not mean that he can solve all of your problems, or that it all becomes his fault. The NHS is not your whipping boy. </p> <p>It seems that we are suffering from an Oprah-fication of our culture: this will be the century of the victim. Proper argument is rarely heard about important, and therefore emotive, issues because it is drowned out by the howls of victims. \"I'm upset and therefore I'm right,\" seems to be the winning argument. When people who see themselves as victims complain about the NHS, their premise is never challenged. </p> <p>A manager, who spoke entirely in jargon, once told me that we lived in a 24/7 culture, and (seemingly under the impression that the health service was, in fact, a shop) that the customer was always right. She therefore answered complaints between 9am and 4pm as follows: yes, we are sorry we lost your dentures; we are sorry you had to wait an hour in clinic; we are sorry that the doctor in A&amp;E was eating sandwiches while you were nil by mouth; we are sorry you felt sick after taking your overdose and had to wait for anti-sickness medicine. Almost without exception, we clinical staff are doing our best in the most challenging of circumstances - and we are not sorry. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The author is a doctor in an inner-city NHS hospital.

  "<p>Sixty years ago today the Butler Education Act entered the statute book - and mythology. </p> <p>The 1944 act was to have a powerful influence for decades on schools in England and Wales and is still the yardstick by which major government education measures are judged - but many of the commonly known \"facts\" about it are wrong, according historian David Crook, of the University of London's Institute of Education.</p> <p>It did not, for instance, introduce the 11-plus or the tripartite system of grammar schools, technical schools and secondary moderns. And it wasn't strictly RA \"Rab\" Butler's act, but was in fact dreamed up by a group of civil servants in a Bournemouth hotel. </p> <p>In the dark days of the second world war there was a widespread resolve to build something better for the future and the Education Act, introducing secondary education for all children, was freighted with these hopes.</p> <p>Brainstorming among civil servants on the board of education, who had been evacuated to the Branksome Dene hotel in Bournemouth, began at least as early as 1941 and produced a \"green book\" entitled Education After the War. </p> <p>\"Being away from London encouraged a good deal of blue-sky thinking,\" Dr Crook said. </p> <p>Similar hopes and forward-thinking had emerged during the first world war in the 1918 Education Act that raised the school leaving age from 12 to 14 and, 80 years ahead of its time, talked of introducing nursery education. Its ambitious plans were nullified when the economy took a dive in the 1920s and 1930s.</p> <p>One of the most striking contrasts between the Butler legislation and education policy under Tony Blair was the involvement of local authorities and the teacher unions (then extremely influential) in the emerging discussions. And although the act was to set a national framework, it was left to local authorities to come up with their own plans to implement it. </p> <p>That partly reflected reality on the ground at a time when ministers didn't have the means to interfere with the minutiae of running schools, but it also reflected the war against Nazi Germany. \"It was felt unhealthy for a strong central state to be determining patterns of education,\" noted Dr Crook.</p> <p>This distrust of central dictat meant there that was very little in the act about what schools should actually teach - apart from religious education - a situation that was to last until the Thatcher government introduced the first national curriculum for England in 1988.</p> <p>In 1943 came a white paper, Educational Reconstruction, and then Butler steered the act through parliament. </p> <p>Although there was a wide consensus for the measure, there were fierce debates, particularly over the role of religion in schools. Church leaders, notably the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, secured the place of religious education in the curriculum for all schools in England and Wales, as well as a daily act of worship which was non-denominational but of course assumed to be Christian.</p> <p>The act also salvaged a lot of crumbling church schools. Around half the Church of England schools moved to local authority control, while about half remained under the control of the local diocese but with running costs and some capital costs met by the state. </p> <p>Butler's act introduced secondary education for all at age 11 - previously children attended elementary school until 14 and only went onto secondary school if their parents could pay (or in very rare cases win a scholarship). </p> <p>As Dr Crook points out, it is a misconception that the act introduced the 11-plus, but most local authorities decided this was best way to implement their plans. This was, after all, the heyday of faith in IQ tests and education officials were confident that children who could benefit from a grammar school could be identified at 11 and, rather less confidently, that they could be sorted out for a technical education. </p> <p>The need for expensive workshops meant that in the event technical schools were few and far between and the muddle over technical (or vocational) education continues to this day. </p> <p>In practice, children either passed the 11-plus or went to secondary modern schools labelled as failures. The number of grammar schools and arrangements varied around the country and a few authorities such as London county council and west Yorkshire produced plans for \"multilateral\" schools - comprehensives, as they were to become known.</p> <p>The 1944 act raised the school leaving age to 15 (achieved in 1947) and aimed to raise it 16 as soon as possible, although it was nearly 30 years before this happened.</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s there were growing educational doubts about the grammar/secondary modern system, fuelled by middle-class resentment about their children going to secondary moderns. </p> <p>\"The middle class is very good at recognising a bad deal. Secondary modern premises were less favourable - they didn't have the labs, libraries and playing fields - and they didn't graduate teachers. It just wasn't such a good deal,\" says Dr Crook.</p> <p>The introduction of comprehensive schools, backed by both Labour and many of Rab Butler's Conservative successors, raised standards and led directly to a leap in the numbers going on to higher education in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </p> <p>Areas in England that retain grammar schools still have worse results than comparable areas with comprehensives, but \"bog-standard comps\" still get a bad press and sneering comments from government advisers. </p> <p>Tony Blair's dream of half of young people experiencing higher education is built on the comprehensives that evolved from the universal secondary schooling of the 1944 act. By the time the children of today's 50% are leaving school their expectations will be even higher. </p> <p>Perhaps in another 40 years the stage will be set for a new Butler Act introducing tertiary education for all.</p>",
  "Perhaps it was the apologies they printed for running stories on Iraqi WMD but the serious press in the US has taken a more sceptical attitude to the Bush administration's \"high alert\" than some of its British counterparts. <p>Where the<b> Times</b> leads on the \"<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1200901,00.html\">terror threat to London</a>\" and the<b> Telegraph</b>, alongside a photograph of heavily-armed New York police, reports on <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/03/wterr03.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/08/03/ixnewstop.html\">threats to the US and Britain</a>, the <b>New York Times</b> questions the intelligence the alert was based on.</p> <p>\"Much of the information that led the authorities to raise the terror alert at several large financial institutions in the New York City and Washington areas was three or four years old,\" begins its <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/03/politics/03intel.html?hp\">front page story</a>.</p> <p>\"Intelligence and law enforcement officials [...] reported that they had not yet found concrete evidence that a terrorist plot or preparatory surveillance operations were still under way.\"</p> <p>The <b>Washington Post</b> goes with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35466-2004Aug2.html\">the same lead</a>: \"More than half a dozen government officials interviewed yesterday, who declined to be identified because classified information is involved, said that most, if not all, of the information about the buildings seized by authorities in a raid in Pakistan last week was about three years old, and possibly older.\"</p> <p>\"There is nothing right now that we're hearing that is new,\" one senior law enforcement official who was briefed on the alert tells the paper. \"Why did we go to this level? . . .

  "<p>Acid rain can benefit the environment by blocking one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, scientists said yesterday. </p> <p>Research led by Vincent Gauci, from the Open University's department of earth sciences, shows that the sulphur in acid rain dramatically reduces the natural production of methane, responsible for an estimated 22% of the greenhouse effect that is causing global warming. </p> <p>Acid rain, produced by industrial emissions of sulphur dioxide, destroys forests and kills fish and other aquatic animals. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years European industry has become much cleaner, and the EU is committed to further emission reductions by 2010. </p> <p>But the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests it might be unwise to halt acid rain completely. </p> <p>Dr Gauci's research showed that other bacteria which thrive on sulphur compete with the methane-makers. Their numbers are so boosted by acid rain that they can significantly reduce methane generation from wetlands. Dr Gauci's team carried out experimental research on wetlands in Morayshire, Scotland, to test the effect of sulphur depositions on methane emissions. The data were then combined with a computer model from the American space agency, Nasa, to provide a global picture. </p> <p>It showed that the effect of acid rain from 1960 to 2030 could reduce methane emissions to pre-industrial levels. </p> <p>\"The effect more than compensates for the increase in methane emission that would be expected as wetlands become warmer,\" said Dr Gauci. \"In effect, acid rain is acting like a lid on the largest methane source. \"</p>",

  "<p>Mock country mansions are to be banned under new planning rules published today that will only allow new buildings in the countryside if they are groundbreaking in design and construction. </p> <p>Under the so-called \"Gummer's law\", named after the Conservative environment secretary John Gummer who introduced it, rich landowners had been allowed to build homes in the open countryside, if they could show they were of \"exceptional\" quality.</p> <p>The rule encouraged a spate of pastiche country houses that imitated various historic styles. </p> <p>The government had threatened to scrap the rule altogether, but has opted instead to change it to promote more innovative designs.</p> <p>Announcing the move, the planning minister, Keith Hill, said: \"I want this new policy exception to underline our commitment to encouraging the highest standards of contemporary design and construction in new country houses.</p> <p>\"Not only do we hope that cutting edge designs for country houses will raise the standards of rural housing more widely, we also expect them to leave a legacy from today's top architects for history books of the future.\"</p> <p>Under the new law, those wanting to build homes in the open countryside will have to convince planning authorities that they are groundbreaking in design, use of materials, and in the way they are constructed. </p> <p>The new rule, known as planning policy statement 7, said: \"Very occasionally the exceptional quality and innovative nature of the design of a proposed, isolated new house may provide this special justification for granting planning permission.\"</p> <p>It added: \"Such a design should be truly outstanding and groundbreaking, for example, in its use of materials, methods of construction or its contribution to protecting and enhancing the environment, so helping to raise the standards of design more generally in rural areas.\"</p> <p>The hi-tech architect Lord Foster said: \"It is wonderful news that the government has recognised the role that good design can play in shaping the way we build in the countryside. This is a very progressive initiative.\"</p> <p>The Royal Institute of British Architects, which campaigned for a more than year for the country house exception rule to be retained, is anxious that the wording of the new law should not be used to dictate any particular style.</p> <p>The institute's president, George Ferguson, said: \"The country house has through the ages been one of the defining elements of our architecture and social history. It has embraced all styles and types, and should continue to be characterised by its excellence rather than an adherence to any one architectural movement.\"</p>",
  "<p>London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, is set to veto Britain's first \u00a31bn hospital under the private finance initiative after its design was today severely criticised by the government's architecture watchdog.</p> <p>The project to rebuild the Royal London hospital in east London as an 18-storey block \"recreates mistakes made in the 1960s\", according to the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe). </p> <p>It added: \"If it were put forward as an office project, it is extremely difficult to imagine it being given planning permission.\"</p> <p>Mr Livingstone is expected to use his planning powers to reject the building on the strength of Cabe's objections.</p> <p>The commission, which reviews all major building projects, has been working with the PFI consortium Skanska Innisfree and its architects HOK for the last two years to improve the design of the new hospital.</p> <p>But in a letter today to Tower Hamlets council, which is the local planning authority, Cabe complained that the consortium had failed to act on its advice to improve the building.</p> <p>The letter also suggested that the PFI process did not encourage good architecture. It said: \"The fact that the result is in our view a failure in significant aspects is as much a criticism of the process of hospital procurement in this country as of the efforts of the trust or their preferred bidder.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time that Cabe has criticised PFI projects. It complained that 17 new PFI police stations in Manchester were \"bland\" and \"disappointing\", and it described the first wave of PFI hospitals as \"urban disasters\".</p> <p>On the detail of the proposed Royal London hospital it said too many rooms had no windows, that the blocks appeared \"jumbled and ad hoc\" and patients would be confused by the complex layout. It also objected to the proposed brightly coloured sides of the building. </p> <p>Cabe said: \"What looks new and modish now may look dated even by the time the building is finished, let alone decades later. We believe that buildings have a duty to represent more enduring qualities.\"</p> <p>Barts and the London NHS trust, which owns the hospital, has claimed the proposed building is designed for \"energy efficiency\", but Cabe questioned this assertion. Its letter said: \"We have little sense that the project proposes more than compliance with the building regulations in terms of energy usage.\"</p> <p>Summing up its objections, the commission said: \"The standard of the design, in our view, falls a long way short of what ought to be expected of one of the largest public sector building projects in the country.\"</p> <p>This is the latest controversy to hit the Royal London. Last year allegations of a conflict of interest emerged over close personal relationships between members of Barts and the London NHS trust and senior employees of the Innisfree subsidiary that will run the new facilities.</p> <p>Paul White, chief executive of Barts and the London NHS trust, rejected Cabe's assessment. He said: \"We recognise that the trust set Skanska Innisfree a very complex design challenge and we believe that their scheme is an excellent solution for our patients and staff.\"</p> <p>David Fison, chief executive of Skanska UK, said: \"As well as being a catalyst for regenerating the area, this project is an integral part of plans to improve health services across north east London and the City, and has the support of all NHS organisations, the Department of Health and the government.\"</p>",
  "The government yesterday responded to a hard-hitting report claiming Labour has not done enough to help the poor by arguing that its commitment to \"a fair society\" depends on reducing the income gap between rich and poor. <p>It was responding to a paper from the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) which said that inequality in Britain has continued to increase since Labour came to power. The audit was a preliminary to an update of a report on social justice published 10 years ago. </p> <p>The new report is likely to look at a range of new issues including migration, childcare and the environment, largely ignored a decade ago. The IPPR found that fewer people are living in poverty than in 1997, but the proportion of wealth held by Britain's richest 10% rose from 47% to 54% during the 1990s. The IPPR has called on Labour to \"publicly advocate a fairer, more equal Britain\". It says the number of childless adults in poverty has also risen in the last 10 years. </p> <p>The IPPR director, Nick Pearce, said the report underlined how much still needed to be done and that the next five years would be critical. \"We would expect it to take longer for Labour to tackle wealth inequality than poverty,\" he said. </p> <p>Research shows that public attitudes to disincentives for benefit fraud are hardening. There is no support for redistribution as a direct aim of public spending and taxation, but there is some acceptance of it as a byproduct. </p> <p>In 1998 the UK had the highest child poverty rate in the EU, but by 2001 it ranked 11th out of the then 15 member states. Yet the UK still has a poor record. In 2001 23% of children in Britain were living in households earning below 60% of median income, compared with 5% in Denmark. </p> <p>Adults without children constitute an \"unfavoured group\", who have not benefited from government policy. In 2002-03 they made up 25% of people in poverty. The IPPR suggests the growth in income inequality has slowed in the 1990s, and much of it has been localised. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A Mori poll for the Financial Times found only 15% of people expected lower taxes if the Conservatives won the next general election. Meanwhile, a Populus survey for the Times found less than a fifth of Tory voters believed their party would win the next election.</p>",
  "<p>The big four accounting firms' campaign to gain protection from lawsuits that could ruin them suffered a setback yesterday at the hands of the Office of Fair Trading. </p> <p>Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers have been trying to persuade the government to limit their liabilities in lawsuits alleging incompetence or negligence in their role as auditors. </p> <p>The accountancy firms hoped that a UK initiative would result in similar protection being provided across the European Union and even the United States, where the bursting of the dotcom bubble revealed corporate scandals that could result in multibillion dollar lawsuits. </p> <p>The government asked the OFT to investigate the competition implications of capping auditors' liabilities and the response from the watchdog yesterday was decidedly negative. </p> <p>\"At present auditors may not limit their liability for fault due to negligence or incompetence in auditor work,\" the OFT said. </p> <p>\"Alongside regulation and reputation, liability acts as a discipline on audit quality ... We are not aware of evidence suggesting that the courts in the UK have made, or are liable to make, excessive damages awards against auditors. </p> <p>\"Professional insurance is available and LLP [limited liability partnership] status - the chosen corporate form of many audit businesses - exists to protect partners' personal assets.\" </p> <p>The accountants argued that capping liability would aid competition by reducing barriers for smaller firms and reducing the risk that one of the big four would face financial ruin. </p> <p>The OFT replied that the current liability position was \"a minor barrier to entry in comparison to reputation, third party perceptions, economies of scale, global networks, regulation and various other impediments\". </p> <p>Unlimited liability did not appear to be deterring firms from undertaking audit work, and it - alongside other services offered to audit clients - represents \"valuable business that the big four appear keen to retain\". </p> <p>The watchdog cited the case of Arthur Andersen, once one of the world's largest accountancy firms, as evidence that reputational rather than financial damage would cause the collapse of a big four firm. </p> <p>After nearly 90 years in business Andersen was brought down as a result of being convicted of obstructing justice by shredding documents during the Enron scandal in the US. </p> <p>The OFT report concluded that an audit cap would not aid competition and could distort it if not adequately designed.</p>",
  "<p>HSBC demonstrated its status as a global banking giant yesterday by generating profits at a faster pace than any other European company. </p> <p>In reporting pre-tax profits of \u00a35.1bn in the first six months of the year, the bank surpassed a previous record set by the oil company BP and set a high hurdle for other big banks. </p> <p>The figures show that although it is based in a new tower in the Canary Wharf complex in London, HSBC does not rely on Britain for its profits. Only 22% of the total is generated in the UK, where it makes money from personal customers, businesses and major corporations. </p> <p>By the bank's own calculations its 8.5m customers in Britain make it \u00a380 profit a year each, or \u00a31.54 a week. The profit angered unions in Britain, where 7,500 jobs are being cut over the next three years, but the bank does not think it is good enough. </p> <p>\"You might criticise me for it. You might say I should be making a lot more,\" Michael Geoghegan, the chief executive of HSBC's UK bank said. </p> <p>The red and white hexagon logo of the self-styled \"world's local bank\" - which first replaced Midland bank's familiar Griffin in 1997 - is found in 79 countries around the world, in which the bank employs 232,000 people and claims 210m customers. About 55,000 work in Britain, 40,000 in the branch business. </p> <p>Hong Kong, where the bank was founded in the 1860s and from which it took its name of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, generated 25% of profits. </p> <p>The largest part - almost 34% of the total - is generated in North America, where HSBC has expanded rapidly through acquisition in the last five years. It bought the banking operations of Edmond Safra shortly before he died in a mysterious fire at home in Monaco, and more recently the consumer finance business Household International. </p> <p>The expansion into the US has been a key part of the transformation of HSBC, and one of the explanations for the record-breaking profits. It now fights with Citigroup of the US and Bank of America as one of the world's top three banks. </p> <p>But the bank was also coming full circle yesterday as it confirmed that it was nearing an agreement with the Chinese authorities to take a near 20% in the Bank of Communications. China was the reason for its creation. It was the market that Thomas Sutherland, the then Hong Kong superintendent of the Peninsula &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company, wanted to tap in the 1860s when he set up HSBC with \"Scottish banking principles\". </p> <p>The bank's top executives still take pride in these Scottish roots, particularly the association with frugality. HSBC's chairman, Sir John Bond, often uses the Jubilee Line to travel to the Canary Wharf headquarters. </p> <p>But in expanding the bank has also had to accept a divergence from its traditional reputation. William Aldinger, the head of the Household business in the US, was hired on a $37m pay packet. Yesterday HSBC revealed that he took home \u00a32.5m in the last six months in free shares as part of this deal. </p> <p>John Studzinski, recently hired to redevelop HSBC's investment banking business, employs a driver and bag carrier. He has hired 700 people to replace the 700 people he let go as part of his efforts to rejuvenate the operation. </p> <p>While the revolving door in the HSBC investment bank has attracted attention in the City, the job cuts in the retail bank are attracting most publicity. By the end of today the 3,500 people who are losing their jobs this year will know who they are. Some of the jobs are being replaced in low cost centres in places such as India, while others are going just to reduce costs. </p> <p>The finance union Unifi has been fighting the job cuts, which are taking place at the same time as the bank is putting an emphasis on boosting business through its 1,587 branches </p> <p>Rob O'Neill of Unifi said: \"We don't know how HSBC directors can sleep at night. Instead of rewarding staff for their part in making HSBC as profitable as it is, the bank is slashing 7,500 jobs in the UK and exporting more and more work to Asia in an attempt to cut costs.\" </p> <p>The bank argues that it needs to boost its business in Britain which, while generating 22% of the overall profit, accounts for 32% of costs. It has a 15% share of the country's 30m current account customers but just a 4% share of mortgages. Its UK profits are less than the equivalent profits of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, which last week reported \u00a31.5bn and \u00a32.1bn profits respectively. </p> <p>The desire to boost its position in mortgages - it achieved record new business in the first half - is one of reasons it has been touted as a potential buyer of Abbey National, which has agreed to sell itself to Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain. </p> <p>HSBC tried to brush off talk of entering a bid battle for Abbey yesterday. But it is one of the few banks to have pulled off a rare cross-border European deal, buying CCF in France three years ago. </p> <p>Stephen Green, the chief executive of the entire HSBC group, insisted that he did not see the bank as British and said the its customers around the world did not either. A recent survey asked customers in Mexico where HSBC came from. The commonest answer was \"don't know\". </p> <p>This lack of identification with Britain, along with the fact that HSBC executives are known to be frustrated by the UK regulatory environment, helps speculation that HSBC will soon move its headquarters from London, where it was forced to locate in 1992 as a condition of buying Midland. Back in the 1860s Thomas Sutherland went to great lengths to avoid a London head office by getting the Treasury to agree to a special order in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Green would only say: \"London is a great place to be based. We are a international bank that happens to be based here.\"</p>",

  "<p>The family that controls the fourth largest cable company in the US, Cox Communications, yesterday offered $7.9bn (\u00a34.3bn) to take the company private. </p> <p>Cox Enterprises, which holds 62% of the firm, said it hoped to take the business off the New York exchange to relieve the short-term performance pressures applied by Wall Street. Barbara Cox Anthony and Anne Cox Chambers, both daughters of founder James Cox, control the Enterprises business. The two women have a combined net worth of $11.2bn, ranking them at number 23 in the latest Forbes rich list. </p> <p>The family has repeatedly rebuffed takeover offers and only listed the cable company shares in 1995. </p> <p>Shares in cable companies have fallen steadily this year under the threat of a revitalised satellite industry, led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which now controls market leader DirecTV. Both the satellite firms and phone companies offering high speed internet access have cut prices and eroded the cable industry's share. </p> <p>DirecTV yesterday said it had agreed to pay $875m (\u00a3479m) to buy the bankrupt assets of Pegasus, the largest independent distributor of satellite TV in the US. Pegasus had filed a lawsuit against DirecTV, alleging that its aggressive tactics had put it out of business. It delivers DirecTV to more than 8.4m homes in 41 states. </p> <p>Cox and its rivals Comcast and Time Warner last week announced a slide in basic cable subscriber numbers. Cox operates in 15 states and is in around 6.3m homes. </p> <p>The family is offering $32 per share, 16% higher than the close on Friday and valuing the business at $20.8bn. </p> <p>James Kennedy, chief executive of Cox Enterprises, said in a statement: \"An increasingly competitive environment convinces us that future investments in the cable industry are best made through a private company structure.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lecturers are threatening a global academic boycott of Nottingham University in a row over a new pay structure. Both the university and the Association of University Teachers accuse each other of refusing to negotiate.</p> <p>The disagreement, which has been simmering for months, follows a hard-won national framework for pay and conditions for all staff in higher education. This now has to be worked out at local level and the union and Nottingham management are at loggerheads over how much flexibility should be allowed under the national deal.</p> <p>The AUT, which insists the university has backtracked on the national agreement, has threatened to \"greylist\" Nottingham from September 20. This would mean academics at other universities in the UK and abroad would not attend conferences at Nottingham or collaborate on research with academics at the institution. Such a move has not been implemented by the AUT for more than five years.</p> <p>The association's general secretary, Sally Hunt, has written to Sir Colin Campbell, vice-chancellor of Nottingham, demanding he stick to the national agreement and stating that the union stands ready to negotiate to resolve the differences between them. </p> <p>The university, for its part, has said it will refuse to negotiate with the threat of greylisting hanging over it.</p> <p>Ms Hunt said: \"University staff have shown the patience of saints in their dealings with Nottingham University. Sadly the management have consistently ignored and undermined the national agreement on pay. Their latest backtracking on a previous commitment is the last straw.</p> <p>\"Triggering a global academic boycott of a leading university is a serious step for us to take. Greylisting is something we rarely threaten to use and because of this it is a step that academics and our sister unions across the globe will support vigorously.\"</p> <p>Nottingham University today expressed deep regret that the possibility of greylisting had been brought into the equation and said the management wanted to settle the new pay structures through negotiation. </p> <p>\"We are willing to negotiate but not under duress,\" said a spokesman. \"A threat of this nature is something no responsible organisation could possibly accept and we advised the AUT of this in March. Meaningful negotiations are impossible while the threat is in existence. We believe that by adopting such a negative approach, the AUT has decided to break off negotiations.\"</p> <p>The university said almost all staff in support roles, such as librarians and technicians, had already chosen to accept a new pay, grading and reward structure. These included a number of AUT members. The university had spent \u00a3800,000 on one-off payments and incurred \u00a31m recurrent costs through assimilating these staff to the new nationally agreed pay spine, added the Nottingham spokesman.</p>",
  "George Mallalieu, who has died of a pseudomonas infection, aged 62, played a significant role in the visual arts in his adopted city of Stoke-on-Trent, and in the lives of many emerging artists nationally. <p>From 1971, he was a driving force in the painting department of North Staffordshire Polytechnic (now Staffordshire University), during a period of considerable upheaval and change in art education. He became departmental head in 1985, and was a generous teacher, perceptive and wise in the analysis of his students' work. A teaching colleague said of him that he was a \"charismatic and inspiring risk-taker, an innovator in fine-art education\". </p> <p>His charm and rhetoric infected the bars of Burslem and the boards of academe. He relished these worlds, and was influential in both. He was accused of being an \"intellectual thug\" by a member of the polytechnic academic board - an epithet he loved. </p> <p>Born in Oldham, Lancashire, of Huguenot descent, George spent much of his early life in minor stately homes, his father working in service as a kitchen gardener. The family moved several times while George, an only child, was growing up, and he went to the King's school, Macclesfield. Eventually, they settled in Stoke-on-Trent. </p> <p>In 1958, George was a cepted at Stoke College of Art, where he studied for three years, supporting himself by working in the footrails, the small mines around Mow Cop, Staffordshire. After gaining a teaching qualification from Manchester College of Art in 1961, he began his career lecturing at Great Yarmouth College of Art, returning to Stoke a year later to teach aesthetics. After marrying in 1966, he took up a teaching post at the University of Kumasi, in Ghana, where he taught for four years. </p> <p>A socialist all his life, George was a principled and practical man, attributes invaluable to an artist who saw his role as a political and social mirror on a world full of unfairness. His paintings drew heavily from other artists, notably Picasso, Goya and Dix. His themes, like theirs, were often political and confrontational. A social and moral stance pervaded all his work; he had a real ability for seeing and depicting global and universal issues in an unpatronising but provocative way. </p> <p>George shunned the commercial gallery world because of its conceit and exploitation, and found much contemporary work shallow and lacking the depth of knowledge and study that he gave to his own. However, he exhibited widely in the non-commercial sector, with one-person exhibitions in Africa and the UK. </p> <p>In 1982, he won first prize in Midland View II with his large painting Massacre Of El Salvador, which continued his use of political themes in his work. These were further demonstrated in his commissioned work for an Amnesty International touring exhibition that travelled from London to Stuttgart and Paris during 1984-85. </p> <p>However, George's type of vivid social commentary was out of favour for much of his later working life, and consequently he did not get the critical acclaim that he deserved. It is a tragedy, too, that because of a devastating studio fire that eradicated most of his work in August 2000, there are so few of his large canvases left to demonstrate his graphic and painterly skills. He never truly recovered from this disaster, and never painted again. </p> <p>George had suffered from arthritis from his early 30s. This became progressively worse through the late 1980s, and forced his early retirement from education in 1991. Afterwards, however, he found a new voice in writing for and developing the visual arts page in the Sentinel, the Stoke-on-Trent daily newspaper. This became his platform for supporting artists and the arts in the town, as well as critiquing national and international art events. </p> <p>He is survived by his first wife, Shelagh, their two children, Karl and Janine, and his second wife, Pam, whom he married in 1992. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>George Frederick Mallalieu, artist, lecturer and arts journalist, born August 16 1941; died July 7 2004</p>"
