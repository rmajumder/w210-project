  "The rising sun is burning off the early morning mist, revealing the lush, green, mountainous border terrain. As I write, the south Armagh landscape is slowly slipping past while the Enterprise train picks up speed again en route to Dublin. Some of the hillsides and mountains appear like semi-shaved heads, with vast tracts of woodland and vegetation clipped away to allow cattle and sheep to graze. <p>To my right, you can make out one of the hilltop fortresses that give the British army a commanding view of what was once their most dangerous frontier region. There are traces of times past when even the main road south was like passing into a war zone with only the CCTV cameras at the Kileen crossing point a reminder that this was once a near permanent military checkpoint and the target of republican sorties. </p> <p>It is all slowly but surely turning back into a normal, picturesque mountainous corner of Ireland - too slowly for the majority living there, too quickly for a declining minority who looked up towards the peaks and were somehow reassured at the presence of those spy posts perched on the high ground of south Armagh. </p> <p>As with the pronunciation of the letter 'H', the name of a certain city in the north-west and even the nomenclature for the State itself, there is discord over how to describe the de-escalation of the military presence in Northern Ireland. Republicans prefer the term 'demilitarisation', probably because it implies some form of retreat by the British armed forces. British ministers prefer the phrase 'normalisation', in all likelihood because it points towards a society similar to any other region of the UK free from any vestige of overt military occupation. </p> <p>Somewhere in the middle of these two lies the unionist interpretation of this process, coloured as ever, when it comes to change, with fear and suspicion. </p> <p>Whichever phrase you choose, one thing is certain: movement towards scaling down the British armed forces' presence in Northern Ireland is inexorable as the terrorist threat wanes; the status quo is no longer an option. </p> <p>That is certainly the view of senior British officers serving in the Province. Over lunch in central Belfast last Tuesday, one army officer made it crystal clear that the reduction of troops and the dismantling of the military apparatus would continue regardless of what may emerge at Leeds Castle, Kent, next weekend. He insisted that whatever the outcome, even if the Ulster parties, as is highly likely, fail to reach a deal to restore devolution, the demilitarisation/normalisation process would go on. </p> <p>The most fascinating aspect of our lunchtime conversation was the officer's exasperation over the attitude of unionist politicians towards this process. 'Surely everyone would welcome steps to normalise life in Northern Ireland, especially the unionists,' he kept repeating in a bewildered tone. </p> <p>He has a point because, for more than a quarter of a century, republicans sought to portray Northern Ireland as abnormal and, therefore, an unviable statelet. The IRA's political leaders and their allies often highlighted the existence of a massive and intrusive military presence as physical evidence that the state was not and could never be a normal entity/society. </p> <p>Now that the Provos' 'war' is over, suddenly it is the unionists who are demanding that all those 'abnormal' aspects of militarism - the watchtowers, the spy posts, the permanent vehicle checkpoints - be retained. </p> <p>For decades, it was the unionists who drew comfort from Margaret Thatcher's tenuous assertion that Northern Ireland was as British as Finchley. Now it is the unionists who appear to want 'war-zone Northern Ireland' to be maintained, while republicans steal the glory for helping to transform the State they once tried to destroy into being as near to 'normal' as Thatcher's former constituency. </p> <p>There are 12,000 British servicemen and women under the command of the GOC in Northern Ireland. The normal peacetime garrison is around 5,000 troops. For uncompromising republicans, that would be 5,000 too many but why is it that for unionists it would not be enough? </p> <p>Ask yourself where, barring Ardoyne on the Twelfth, there was a major military deployment anywhere in urban Northern Ireland and the answer is the leafy, prosperous and solidly unionist North Down during the UVF-LVF feud earlier this year. In fact, the last three major military deployments since the start of the century - the Shankill 2000, Holy Cross 2001, North Down 2004 - have all involved the security forces squaring up to loyalist terrorists and their supporters. </p> <p>'Stable' and 'normal' were never adjectives republicans wanted to see used to describe Northern Ireland. So why are unionists running away from them now, at the very moment in history when it is possible to lay to rest the tradition of physical-force republicanism and thus secure a society no longer under violent, existential threat? The paradox couldn't be greater. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk </a><br><br></p> <p>Due to a production error Henry McDonald's column <a href=\"http://observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1302922,00.html\">The death of football</a> did not appear online last week.

  "<p>The next few days will be uncomfortable ones for scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico. They are about to spend the week on their hands and knees scrabbling over the Utah desert. </p> <p>Their goal is simple: they are seeking intact fragments of cargo from the $150-million Genesis spacecraft that plunged out of the sky last week and buried itself in a large sandy crater outside Salt Lake City. </p> <p>It was an ignominious end to a mission that had promised so much. For two years, Genesis - carrying suntraps made of wafers of gold, diamond and sapphire - had been hovering a million miles from Earth, gathering billions of atoms of primordial material as they streamed from the sun. This payload was to be used by scientists to gain key insights into the formation of the sun and the planets - our own world included. </p> <p>It was not to be. A parachute failed and Genesis, filled with its precious particles, hit the Utah desert, as dismayed scientists looked on. </p> <p>'There was a big pit in my stomach. This just wasn't supposed to happen,' Roger Wiens, Genesis's flight payload chief, said yesterday. 'On the other hand, we are still hopeful. We can see that some of the solar wind wafers still look intact.' </p> <p>It remains to be seen if these fragments are too contaminated to provide useful data. Most scientists remain gloomy. Indeed, it was noticeable that before the Utah sands had even settled over Genesis's wreckage, scientists were calling for a replacement mission. </p> <p>Such hopes may be naive, but they also reveal an intensity of commitment, not just for space science in general, but for solar research in particular. And this is a crucial point: Genesis was no one-off probe to the sun, but was one of a flotilla of spacecraft and ground-based missions that have recently transformed our knowledge of our nearest star. </p> <p>'This is the golden age of solar science,' said Professor Eric Priest, of St Andrews University. 'Losing Genesis was a blow, but there is so much more we are learning about the sun - and it is going to have a profound impact on all our lives.' </p> <p>In mines deep below the ground, scientists have created lakes of detergents which they use to trap phantom-like particles called neutrinos emitted by the sun; in orbit, satellites like Soho (the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) monitor magnetic sun storms big enough to swallow the Earth; and on mountain peaks in Hawaii and Chile, astronomers are studying the sun in unprecedented detail. </p> <p>And after all, no other object in the universe, outside our own planet, is more important to our well-being. The sun's emissions drive our weather and climate. It is our closest connection to the basic forces that control the universe. And of course, without the sun's warming rays, life would be impossible. Virtually every source of energy we possess - with the exception of nuclear power - is derived from solar radiation. Coal and oil are by-products of plants and animals that once thrived in ancient sunlight. </p> <p>Yet we now know the light that provided this precious sustenance has taken a very long time to reach us. The sunbeams that shine on us today began their journey before the last ice age and needed hundreds of thousands of years to push their way through the maelstrom of activity below the sun's surface. </p> <p>'It is incredibly hot and dense down there,' said Professor Richard Harrison, of the Rutherford Laboratory. 'Light is generated by particles and is then absorbed and re-emitted by other particles. The process goes on for aeons before light can reach the surface.' After that, it is a mere eight-minute skip across the 93-million mile gap to the Earth. </p> <p>'The sun is not a simple ball of incandescent gas in which hydrogen is quietly being transformed by nuclear fusion into helium,' he added. 'It seethes with activity. Satellites images make it look more like a great plate of writhing spaghetti. Great loops of energy shimmer and twist and occasionally break, hurling huge globs of matter, made up of millions of cubic kilometres of plasma, into space.' </p> <p>And when these coronal mass ejections, as they are known, strike Earth, we feel the impact. Powerful aurora displays appear over the poles, the electronics on satellites are fried, and entire power grids are disrupted. In 1989 a solar storm plunged Quebec into darkness, leaving seven million people without electricity. </p> <p>'Basically, when the sun sneezes we all catch a cold,' said Cambridge astronomer Paul Murdin. </p> <p>In an attempt to understand this solar influenza, a flotilla of four European satellites called Cluster is now swooping around the sun, analysing the streams of particles that pour from its surface. The aim is to predict storms that could otherwise devastate our modern electronically dependant world. </p> <p>But the sun does more than merely disrupt communications and power. Scientists have found that during the 17th and 18th century, sunspots completely disappeared. At the same time, the world plunged into a period called the Little Ice Age. Inuit paddled kayaks from Greenland to tour Scotland's icy coastline, snow fell in summertime, while crops failed and famines killed millions. Scientists believe the two phenomena - cold and lack of sunspots - are closely connected. </p> <p>'We still do not exactly understand the correlation, but it is clear that the sun does not behave in a static, unchanging manner and these alterations have a major impact on our climate,' Priest said. 'Given humanity's role in triggering global warming, it is vital we discover if the sun is going to mitigate or enhance man-made global warming.' </p> <p>Such interest explains the armada being sent, or about to be sent, to study the sun. As well as Soho and Cluster, new missions include Stereo - in which one spaceship will fly ahead of and another behind Earth as it orbits, creating 3-D images of the sun - and Solar Orbiter, which will swoop close to the sun's surface to gain a detailed view of its surface. The lessons learned will be of critical importance not just to understanding our own planet but in providing a key to the rest of the universe. </p> <p>'The sun gives us our only chance to study another star,' said the Open University's Professor Colin Pillinger, one of the scientists who had been hoping to study particles returned by Genesis. </p> <p>'The planets were all created from debris left over from the sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. We also know that the moon and Earth are isotopically very similar and must have a common origin. Mars is different, however. So we want to know which - Earth or Mars - is more like the sun. If Earth is different, we will then want to know why. Perhaps we are made of material left over from an earlier part of the universe's history.' </p> <p>It is a fairly dramatic prospect, and explains why astronomers are so fascinated by the sun. It also explains why scientists will be spending all that time and effort, scrabbling on their knees looking for fragments of Genesis's cargo on the Utah desert floor this week. A little bit of sunshine could tell us an awful lot. </p> <p><strong>Light of our lives </strong></p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The sun is 70 per cent hydrogen and 28 per cent helium. The rest mainly carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> It is 6,000C at its surface; 15,000,000C at its core. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Its diameter is 870,000 miles, 109 times larger than the Earth's. Over a million Earths can fit in its volume.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Average distance from the Earth is 93 million miles. The next nearest star is 24 billion billion miles away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Wayuu people of South America believe the sun and moon are procreating during eclipses and so avert their eyes.</p>",
  "<p>Broxburn industrial estate, under the flight path of Edinburgh's busy international airport, is not where you'd expect to find tranquillity, but that's where Glenmorangie - Scots Gaelic for 'vale of tranquillity' - is based, and from where the company is running a \u00a3300 million global auction of its business. </p> <p>This is a big thing in Scotland, and in the drinks industry, where good brands - and Glenmorangie is up there with the best - do not come on the market so frequently. And when one is sold, there is often an outburst of national indignation that another great Scots brand is being handed over to the global giants. </p> <p>So far, that has not been the case with Glenmorangie, although news of its sale - prematurely broken in the business pages a few weeks back - sent a temporary shock through the 111-year sold company. Paul Neep, chief executive for the past seven years, admits: 'It was a surprise to the board, but it was obviously a family decision.' </p> <p>The family in this case is the Macdonald clan, who founded Glenmorangie in 1893 and who have a holding equivalent to just over 50 per cent of the voting shares and one third of the value - making the the 15 or so family members worth something over \u00a3100m. </p> <p>David Macdonald, the 71-year-old family patriarch, could have been portrayed as a betrayer of Scotland's whisky heritage, but in fact he has had a largely sympathetic press. Old hands at Brox burn regret the need for change, but understand why it had to happen: 'If I had the chance of \u00a3100m in the bank I'd sell too,' said one long-term employee. </p> <p>Neep, and his deputy and finance director Iain Hamilton, recognise the reality of the situation: 'At the end of the day, the shareholders decide. And I can see why they'd want to sell now,' says Neep. </p> <p>It was no sudden decision by the Macdonalds. David, who retired as chairman 10 years ago, was the last of the male line of the family who wanted any executive role with Glenmorangie. Of his four daughters, two work for the firm, but not at an executive level. 'He had reached an age where he had to think of how the family wealth would be passed on,' says a financier close to the auction process. </p> <p>With family shareholdings becoming increasingly unpopular with City investors (see below), the Macdonalds really had only one option - to sell their stake - and this would inevitably trigger a change of ownership. </p> <p>Commercial considerations, of course, were high up the Macdonalds' priorities. The shares were approaching all-time-high levels as the markets got the message that Glenmorangie had been transformed under Neep and Hamilton, and was close to achieving 'superbrand' status within the multi-billion-pound Scotch whisky market. </p> <p>It is important to clarify from the outset that Glenmorangie is not just any old whisky, something to have with Coke or lemonade, or to add to the post-prandial coffee. It - and the other big brands in the portfolio, Glen Moray and Ardbeg - are single malts made with loving care at the Tain distillery in Ross-shire. According to the legend, the 16 'men of Tain' still hold the secrets of the distillation process that gives the whisky its characteristic flavour, highly praised by malt aficionados. </p> <p>Malt sales have been rising as 'ordinary' - blended - Scotch sales fell back in the Nineties. With the average age of drinkers getting higher, Scotch had an image problem: it was the drink your parents had in the cabinet, and therefore was not likely to appeal. </p> <p>The marketing slant of the malt whisky makers changed to reflect the unique 'matureness' of the product, and the customer. If you knew your single malts, you were a creature of serious sophistication. Discerning the subtle variations on the malt distilling process - ageing in different kinds of wood and for longer periods before bottling - became a skill similar to that of a wine expert in telling different grapes and vineyards. </p> <p>Take a look through the Glenmorangie annual report to appreciate the marketing technique. The happy-looking drinkers are thirtysomething metropolitans, discerning professionals who appreciate the heritage of single malts and the prestige of the brand. </p> <p>This upmarket strategy was the brainchild of Neep and Hamilton. 'We are focused and brand-driven, and there is a passion and belief inside the company that the brands can work for you,' says Neep. </p> <p>Under their regime, it certainly has worked for Glenmorangie. The eponymous brand this year replaced Glenlivet as the number one single malt in Britain, and it is making serious inroads into foreign markets - the US, Canada, Germany and Scandinavia all have a taste for the malt, while drinkers in Japan and Taiwan are also beginning to develop a liking for it. </p> <p>The Far East was the growth engine for the last great wave of expansion in whisky sales in theNineties, and Neep sees it as the big opportunity for malts too. 'A lot of young Taiwanese are drinking malts - it's an increasingly important area,' he says. </p> <p>So, under new management and with the hiccup of the Nineties behind it, the future looks good for Glenmorangie's business. It looks an attractive asset that in most sectors would command a queue of potential buyers - from the trade, venture capitalists, even management buyouts. </p> <p>But the se rules do not apply to the drinks business. The global spirits industry is dominated by the big international groups - Diageo, Allied Domecq, Brown Forman, Bacardi Martini, Pernod Ricard, and LVMH. Smaller groups such as Glenmorangie need to do deals with these giants to ensure all-important distribution overseas, and this is a decisive factor in the financing of a disposal. </p> <p>Put simply, non-trade buyers - including the management - cannot produce the synergies to make a deal work at the suggested \u00a3300m price-tag. So, despite all their experience and acumen, Neep and Hamilton will not get a chance to mount an MBO. 'It was obvious early on that a management buyout was very unlikely,' says Neep, 'so the priorities became getting the best deal for shareholders, and protecting employment.' </p> <p>There is some uneasiness among Glenmorangie's 360-strong workforce that a big multinational would axe jobs in Scotland and destroy the special relationship has with its workers - the firm was recently voted the second best company to work for in Scotland. </p> <p>But it is not inevitable this would happen. Brown Forman, for example, the American producer of Jack Daniels that has a 10 per cent stake in the Scots firm and distribution agreements all over the world, would not want to destroy the brand value by hacking back its Scots heritage. </p> <p>Of the other possible bidders, Diageo, which dominates the Scotch whisky industry, is probably out of the frame because of its huge market position; Bacardi could emerge as a serious challenge to the giant American, but industry observers believe Allied, LVMH and Pernod are less interested. The outside money is going on CL Financial, a big financial conglomerate that recently moved into wines and distillers. </p> <p>As for price, Glenmorangie's advisers are coy, but \u00a3300m seems eminently achievable. Hamilton is quick to point out that the company's stock of malt and other whiskies - carried on the book at historic cost of \u00a383m, but insured for closer to \u00a3500m - would be worth \u00a3230m on its own if sold on the bulk market. </p> <p>And that leaves out the value of the brand. 'Nobody else in the world can produce Glenmorangie,' says Neep, 'and it's taken us and the Macdonalds 40 years to build the brand. That must be worth a premium.' </p> <p>And what will happen to the duo when the new owner is named? 'We've both got a passionate affection for the business, but we're just employees, like everybody else. We'd love to stay on, but it's not up to us,' says Neep. Hamilton is in full agreement.</p> <p><strong>Why the Macdonald clan want to sell their heritage</strong></p> <p>The Macdonalds, benevolent owners of the Glenmorangie business for 111 years, are the latest example of a trend that has changed the face of British business over the past three decades, and which promises to lead to further transformations in the near future. </p> <p>The City does not like family-controlled companies. And it likes even less family companies with split share structures.</p> <p>For decades, family businesses dominated the stock markets. The Bernsteins, the Pearsons and the Fortes are all examples of families that started firms, floated them, and finally came under pressure to reduce their hold. The Sainsbury family is now feeling the same pressure.</p> <p>Some of them - like the Macdonalds - developed a weighted share structure in which different classes of shares had different voting strengths. At Glenmorangie, the class B shares have five times the voting strength of the more heavily traded class As, giving the Macdonalds majority control. In theory, this could have led to a conflict of interest with the senior management. If the executive board wanted to raise capital or make an expensive acquisition, it would have to go to the market for approval. But the City would be likely to insist on structural changes as a pre-condition of opening the purse-strings.</p> <p>There were other factors peculiar to Glenmorangie, however. David Macdonald, who ran the business until 10 years ago, is father of four daughters, but it appears that none of them wanted an executive role in the traditionally male-dominated Scotch business.</p> <p>At the same time, as advisers explain, he was conscious of his advancing years, and of the firm's advancing share strength. Earlier this year, on behalf of the 15 or so other family members who held shares, he decided the time for a sale had come.</p> <p>It may not be just the Macdonalds who get the benefit of the Glenmorangie windfall. The family's trust, which holds the majority of the shares, is a real charitable institution and may be able to make significantly bigger donations to its favoured causes - mainly cancer research organisations - on the back of a \u00a3100 million sale.</p> <p>As for the Glenmorangie workers, it is still unclear whether or not they will share in the Macdonalds' good fortune - but such an idea has not been ruled out.</p>",
  "<p>It might be a glass 'Gherkin', or perhaps even an original 1960s Twyford toilet roll holder at the Barbican, that catches your eye. Either way, there's a wealth of inspiration to be had at next weekend's Open House London - from white rendered Bauhaus semis in Ruislip, to multicoloured metal shipping containers- turned-artists' studios at Tower Hamlets. </p> <p>Back for its twelfth year, the event will be the biggest ever, with nearly 600 buildings open free of charge. Forget makeover shows on TV - this weekend offers a rare first-hand glimpse of some of our finest architecture and interiors. </p> <p>New this year is 30 St Mary Axe (aka the 'Gherkin') in the City; a U-shaped house with cascading glass atrium in Highgate; and the wooden-clad new-build 'Big House' in Mortlake. Old favourites include Erno Goldfinger's monumental Trellick Tower, the Foreign Office, and - for the last time before its refurbishment - Sir George Gilbert Scott's St Pancras Chambers at the former Midland Grand Hotel. </p> <p>Further afield you can visit a golden-domed Sikh temple in Southall, or go on a tour of the Becontree Estate in Dagenham, built in the 1920s and 1930s and once the largest estate in Europe, with 25,000 houses. For something more unusual, visit the disused Kingsway Tram Subway, built in 1906 as the link between the northern and southern sections of the tram network. </p> <p>'It's not a static exhibition - there are always new buildings being added,' says Victoria Thornton, founding director of Open House London, who admits that choice can be overwhelming. 'It's like when you go to a big art exhibition - you don't know where to start.' The advice is to plan ahead (get a list of buildings from local libraries or the website) and be prepared to queue. </p> <p>The owners of more than 70 private residential houses are taking part in the event. 'They're sharing their home with strangers for the day - that openness is incredible,' says Thornton. </p> <p>'It's not a very British thing to do - in some countries you can knock on someone's door and they'll let you in and show you around.' </p> <p>One of Thornton's favourites is 'Glass House One' in Forest Hill. Built by architect-owner Chris Firth, it is one of two live-work units on the cobbled mews and artists' enclave Havelock Walk. The three-storey steel and glass house has an innovative curved glass roof to provide light (the building is attached on three sides). 'We got so many requests from people wanting to have a look around,' says Firth. </p> <p>Columbian architect-designer Lucho Brieva is also partaking in Open House for the first time. His Kensal Rise live-work space, a former Victorian stables and railway depot, has a metal workshop and gallery on the ground floor, with a living space above. </p> <p>On the second floor is a recording studio in which Brieva, who was formerly married to Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde, is recording an album in collaboration with former Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera. </p> <p>Brieva's living space is a lesson in minimalism. 'It's important to have a place that is sacred, where you can recharge,' he says. He has a very emotional connection with his living space - although he doesn't mind opening it to the public. 'I thought, why not? It is a way of promoting my work and I like to see people's faces when they walk into the house.' </p> <p>Fans of Grand Designs should visit 'Seven-and-a-half Trouville Road' in Clapham. The show documented Anjana and David Devoy's brave attempt at a self build with - in presenter Kevin McCloud's words - a 'tight schedule, a tight budget, and no experience'. Designed to curve around a protected chestnut tree, and turning its back on the surrounding housing estates, the build was problematic and unfinished when the programme was broadcast in February.</p> <p>Next year, five new residential buildings inspired by Open House will themselves be open for the weekend. 'It directly encouraged [these self-builders] to have a better dialogue with their architects,' says Thornton. 'That's the main aim: to help people understand and enjoy their environment. Once you do that, you can demand better buildings.' </p> <p>The President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, George Ferguson, praised Open House and its associated event for children: 'We're visually illiterate as a nation, compared with other European countries... If one can get the young interested in architecture, the parents get involved too.' </p> <p>Open House has sparked similar events across the country. This weekend's national Heritage Open Days scheme, co-ordinated by the Civic Trust and largely funded by English Heritage, has highlights including Elizabeth Gaskell's regency-style house in Manchester and - open for the first time in 20 years - the Small Concert Room at St George's Hall, Liverpool, where Charles Dickens read extracts from his works.</p>",
  "<p>Journalism scrambles to keep up with the muddled, messy happenings of the day; history arranges the snapshots into a picture, or into what used to be called a history painting. Napoleonic soldiers gunned down Spanish protesters on 3 May 1808. Goya, painting the scene, organised the resistance into a martyrdom, with one victim stretching out his arms in a crucified pose as the bullets jolt him. German planes bombarded the Basque town of Guernica in April 1937. Picasso's grandiose mural treated the calamity as a classical tragedy, with tormented statues grimacing at the sky as mythic monsters rampage through the streets. Between the event and the representation there was, traditionally, a pause for thought. The images that commemorated such disasters, or the stories told about them, consciously took sides and pointed morals. They did so in retrospect, reviving a moment from the past in order to ponder its significance. Today, the technologies of news-gathering have accelerated the cycle and garbled it; the event is interpreted for us while we're watching it happen, and the interpreters are participants. In Beslan last week, photographers raced into the besieged school along with the rescuers, and reporters quizzed traumatised children on their way to hospital. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a continent away, erstwhile SAS officers who had been plucked from lunch and taxied to television studios opined about a story that was still taking place, pretending to see through the smoke and the agitated crowds. Picture editors scanned a gusher of digital images, and made impromptu choices about which incident to pick out of the affray and what meaning to attach to it. No one had time to wonder about the ethics or even the aesthetics of what they were doing. </p> <p>Should the hunters and gatherers of news have thrown down their equipment and helped the rescuers? However gamely they dodged bullets, they seemed unaware of the moral dangers that beset them. On the one hand, they were abetting the hostage-takers, who had made their own video record of the siege and expected the media to publicise their cause. </p> <p>On the other hand, they were entertaining a public at home that could watch the anguish of all these Caucasian strangers with a sort of theoretical sympathy, as if at a disaster movie: of course it was terrible, but - like fiction - it was situated at a safe, comfortable distance from our reality. The news has become another consumer item.The satellite receivers on our roofs are called dishes, and they feed us images. Have we developed an appetite for horrors like this? Susan Sontag, in her recent meditation on the pleasure we derive from reading about and watching the pain of others, contends that photojournalism was a product of war, and accuses it of being hungry for conflict, thirsty for gore. The US army shrewdly exploited this craving when it 'embedded' reporters with troops on the front line in Iraq. Closeness to the action makes the observer a combatant, and eliminates critical distance. It can also provoke a mad, self-dramatising bravado. The Life photographer Robert Capa waded ashore with the troops on D-Day, and played hide and seek with snipers during the Allied liberation of Paris. Was he supplying the magazine's readers with information, or with vicarious thrills? If war correspondents are heroic figures, that means that war itself is accorded a swaggering, reckless heroism. It's interesting that Sky News dispatched a female reporter to Beslan. Perhaps the aim was to neutralise Sontag's claim that war is a thing for guys, and to forestall butch attitudinising; certainly, as she hyperventilated her way through the commentary, Rachel Amatt sounded terrified. But there may have been another, more cynical calculation behind her assignment. The story was about children and their agonised, grieving mothers: did the bosses think that a woman would be a more emotionally ingratiating witness? </p> <p>For the people of Beslan, it made little difference. Unedited, unmediated, Sky's live reports couldn't help revealing what the locals thought of the contingent of electronic voyeurs who had descended on them. A rescue worker gruffly pushed a camera out of the way; a woman deranged by sorrow battered another lens as if blaming it for what had happened. If the journalists were present as extensions of our eyes, these gestures warned that we had no business to be looking at any of this. </p> <p>As the coverage continued on that Friday afternoon, I began to realise that the documentation on offer was not to be trusted. News doesn't unstoppably happen 24 hours a day. Only a few minutes of live footage was transmitted from the scene as the hostages escaped; looped, the same shots of children in their underwear fleeing down a smoky alley were endlessly repeated, like action replays of goals in football. On the soundtrack, ownerless and irresponsible voices confidently relayed what we were asked to accept as facts. </p> <p>A boy rushing out was asked whether there were any dead bodies inside. He mumbled something and ran on; he was said to have answered 'No, there aren't.' Later, an invisible reporter announced 'We are assured that all the children are safe.' Everyone was anxious to sort out the confusion into a story, and if possible to give it a happy ending. Hence this peddling of false, premature consolation. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon, as it became clear that the outcome would be grimmer, Sky produced another version of the story. One of its hourly news bulletins accompanied the same flustered, incoherent footage with a musical commentary: a Mahlerian threnody, as if a symphony orchestra had been sent to Beslan to assist the journalists. That mournful music exposed the purpose of such reporting. </p> <p>Rather than transmitting facts, it exists to stir up emotions - literally to orchestrate them. And those emotions, despite the misery that provokes them, are bound to be pleasurable, allowing us to congratulate ourselves on our capacity for fellow-feeling (and on our good fortune on not being Caucasian). </p> <p>Over the weekend, the newspapers defined themselves by the images they selected to encapsulate the story. The Sunday Times devoted its front page to three frames recording the fate of one victim. A little girl is ejected from the gym by an explosion, rocketed to safety by the blast. In the next frame, she picks herself up and - wretchedly skinny, stripped, with scratched and bruised legs - climbs back into the building. (The caption, with fussily intrusive empathy, attributed a motive to her irrational, disoriented act: 'perhaps she was seeking her relatives'.) The third frame has the brash eloquence of one of those cartoons that screech CRASH! BAM! POW! as Tom pummels Jerry. It simply shows a furnace inside what used to be the gym: blown free, the anonymous child returned just in time to die. </p> <p>Photographs have no fixed meaning until they are interpreted. That interpreting is an insidious process, because the decisions being made - how to crop an image, what text to underpin it with - remain out of sight. Hence the distress I feel when looking at and thinking about an image in last weekend's edition of the Paris paper Lib\u00e9ration. It's a photograph that is truly pictorial - almost a Nativity scene, just as Goya's painting of that political execution in 1808 was a crucifixion. A young, beautiful woman in black kneels on the grass and lays a soothing hand on the brow of her baby, wrapped in white on a stretcher. This woman had obviously emerged as one of the photogenic protagonists at Beslan: she can be seen from another angle in the Spanish paper El Mundo, so she must have surrounded by snappers, like Mary in the manger with her attendant wise men and genuflecting cattle. </p> <p>It looks like a tender vignette until you read the Lib\u00e9ration caption: 'Une femme devant le corps de son enfant mort' ('Woman with the body of her dead child'). That surely orders us, too late, to look away. Yet when the same photograph appeared in Aujourd'hui en France, the caption didn't declare the baby to be dead. How could it be, since its face is uncovered? If it were, wouldn't its mother have been cradling it rather than extending that soothing hand? Perhaps I am fondly clinging to a delusive hope. Still, I can't help wondering whether the picture editor at Lib\u00e9ration simply killed off the child in the caption to increase the photograph's payload. </p> <p>On the cover of that issue, Lib\u00e9ration at least had the delicacy to crop the close-up of another small girl - her face paralysed in a rictus of terror - being rushed away in the arms of a rescuer. The Russian newspaper Argumenty i Facty included some extra, subliminal details, censored by the placing of the frame in Lib\u00e9ration: the rescuer grabs the girl under her knees, so her bottom sags close to the camera, which unforgivably stares at her panties. The sexual flagrancy of the image is contradicted (or, if you like, intensified) by the way her bare feet are locked into position, as if frozen, like her face, by fear. I'd call the bottom half of this photograph obscene: it is, quite literally, something we should not be allowed to see. </p> <p>The image on the cover of Izvestia, whose reporting so angered Putin that he had the paper's editor sacked, is disturbing for similar reasons. What enraged the apparatchiks in the Kremlin was the visual evidence of mismanagement and confusion, grainily captured inside Izvestia by stilled frames taken from CNN and BBC World. Chaos is the natural condition of live coverage; it also damagingly demonstrates that no one is in charge. Yet the photograph on the cover of the paper could be posed, because it teasingly alludes to scenes of exotic carnage and blowsy carnality painted by Titian, Rubens and Delacroix. This woman is an adult: the tableau might be a rape not a rescue. Izvestia observed the decorums by air-brushing her nipple, though it's still visible as a bud of pixels. But why did they leave in the thin black tracery of the thong she's apparently wearing? Morgen in Hamburg ran a variant, with another grizzled rescuer leading out another nubile woman. Her hair is wet, tousled; she is wearing a denim skirt and a lacy bra. The German caption excused our salacious gaze by scanning her exposed body for information. 'Because of the heat inside,' it said with leaden Teutonic obviousness, 'she is half-naked.' Jean-Luc Godard once sourly remarked that all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun. Beslan, seen like this, was ripe for exploitation. The headline above the photograph in the Hamburg paper referred to the siege as a drama, and broadcast a line of dialogue in loud, bold type: 'We drank urine.' </p> <p>The other side of this brazen titillation is a sanctimonious sentimentality. The Italian paper Il Messaggero found it only too easy to classify the images it ran as specimens of baroque religious art, operatically distraught but piously uplifting. A naked boy in one photograph is clutched by a commando, who presses his rifle to the child's vulnerable, shivering flesh. Perversity into magicked into something more mawkish by the caption, which is 'Il Bambino ed Il Soldato'. You don't need the words to tell you that you're looking at a boy and a soldier; they're not informative but manipulative, since they turn the scene into another allegorical tableau, equating grace and goodness with the possession of a weapon. </p> <p>Ethical scruples may make us avert our gaze from such images. But are we then colluding with the politicians who want to suppress them because of the inconvenient truths they tell? Bush's aides scheme to keep the cameras away from the coffins of GIs killed in Iraq, believing that death has not really happened unless it is photographed; Putin, railing at Izvestia, hoped to make the problem of Beslan disappear by regarding it with blind, official eyes. </p> <p>Brought to heel on 7 September, Izvestia replaced broken bodies with a minimal list of names and faceless numbers. Its evasively artful front-cover photograph - cramped into a corner and surrounded by tracts of extenuating print - had two silhouettes pointing to some sheets of paper that tallied casualties. The shadows belonged to bodies that remained outside the frame; the names were unfocused and therefore unreadable. The human tragedy had been effaced. </p> <p>On an inside page, Putin was seen touching a child in a hospital bed. But photography is tactless and coldly candid; even tyrants (who prefer portrait painters) can't ensure that it flatters them. This image assaulted Putin more scurrilously than any caricature could have done. His hand cursorily rests on the sheet; there is no contact, because the sick child, perhaps unconscious, is facing the other way. And the uncropped version, which appeared in El Pa\u00eds last Sunday, included an additional snub. Beside the bed is a black-clad relative, a generic Russian babushka, who turns her back on the President and supports her face with her weary hands, lost in a private, incommunicable despair. This photo-opportunity proved inopportune. </p> <p>First impressions - as the children gulped water or were bundled onto makeshift stretchers and driven to hospital in derelict cars - were of mayhem and panic, conveyed with raw verisimilitude by the news channels. 'LIVE' in the corner of the screen means shapeless, anarchic. By Tuesday, when the funerals began, the story was tidied up, ennobled and beautified. The photograph by Sergei Chirikov on the cover of the Times that day could not have been further from those initial blurred, unintelligible documents of people running through rubble. The heads of two female mourners on a bus leaving a cemetery lean together, pressing cheek to cheek like one face duplicated by a mirror; between black scarves and black dresses, their skin is drained, pale. They are seen through the bus window on a wet day, so the blotched pane of glass is a veil of tears. The window muffles the siren song of their wailing, and the raindrops merge with the soft, liquid-looking beads of a necklace. The photograph's effect is intolerably decorative: its prettiness, I suppose, announces closure, since Chirikov was more worried about composition than commiseration. </p> <p>The reporters had now turned into narrators, laying the event to rest as if interring it. On Wednesday morning, Jonathan Charles in a BBC News broadcast referred to 'last Friday's denouement'. Debacle, I'd have thought, might have been a better word; a denouement is the untying of a knot, sorting out the snarled complexities in a literary plot. That same day a Times journalist came up with an anecdote that read like an excerpt from a novel. The hostage-takers had told one woman that she could leave the school with her two-year-old son if she left her six-year-old daughter behind. Bargaining was not possible: the only alternative was for all three to stay. </p> <p>Zalina Dzandarova agonised, then chose to save her little boy; as she walked out, her deserted daughter screamed at the betrayal. This is, of course, the situation examined by William Styron in Sophie's Choice. But art, as always, is more satisfactory and orderly than life. Sophie lets the Auschwitz guards take her daughter off to be gassed, and by her choice earns a reprieve for her son. Still she cannot forgive herself, and her suicide is a belated atonement. Zalina's daughter escaped, but it remains unclear whether this story will end happily. She will know for the rest of her life that her mother, in an emergency, chose to sacrifice her. </p> <p>Watching all this, I came to feel ashamed of my own tendency to see things aesthetically - the way I admired the weightless balletic elegance with which a fleeing woman, rendered legless by fatigue and fear, collapsed onto a stretcher, or my wincing reaction to the carious teeth and violently hennaed hair of the mourners. The truth is ugly, aesthetically irredeemable. Twisted, fragmentary bodies in Argumenty i Facty, sprawled beneath a pile of broken furniture. An open-air morgue in El Pa\u00eds, with corpses stuffed into transparent bin-liners, allowed no posthumous privacy. I derived some hope, however, from the cheerful resilience of two boys caught in the corner of the BBC camera's promiscuous eye during a bulletin on Tuesday. </p> <p>While adults placed candles in the burned-out gym and sobbed as they searched for the spot where their loved ones perished, this pair gambolled in the wreckage, jumping over a hole blasted through an upper floor. They didn't know that their town was the setting for a tragedy: how could they, since they hadn't watched Sky News or read the foreign press? For them, the siege was an adventure story, and the bombs had transformed their school into an excitingly perilous playground. </p> <p>Their nonchalance was as much of a rebuff as the anger of the woman who beat a camera with her fists the previous Friday. It served as a reminder that, whether we were watching these people live or die, we had no right to be there. At best, journalists in such circumstances are irrelevant. At worst, they act as publicists for the terrorists, guaranteeing them global coverage to the spectacle they stage. It is time we stopped looking at the agonies of others and began to scrutinise our own motives.</p>",

  "<p>Merrill Lynch has been forced to abandon a key part of its defence against Stephanie Villalba, the former executive bringing a high-profile sex discrimination claim against the investment bank.</p> <p>Raymundo Yu, Villalba's former boss, admitted last week that Villalba was not solely responsible for $46 million of losses sustained by her division in 2002. The admission appears to undermine one of Merrill's stated reasons for removing her. </p> <p>Yu told the employment tribunal at Croydon that the bank's European private client business was losing money even before Villalba was appointed to run it. 'A large part of the financial conditions [was] way beyond her control, and therefore I cannot completely attribute that to her,' he said. </p> <p>Villalba had denied that she was losing Merrill almost $1m a week by the end of 2002. </p> <p>Her lawyers have argued that the department's losses should be seen in the context of depressed markets, and were, anyway, not as heavy as the bank claimed. </p> <p>Villalba, who left Merrill last year, accuses the bank of sex discrimination, victimisation, unequal pay and unfair dismissal. She claims Merrill is 'institutionally sexist' and is demanding compensation of around \u00a37.5m. </p> <p>Merrill strongly denies her allegations and is presenting more than 20 witnesses to the tribunal in its defence. </p> <p>Yu, the bank's global private client chief, criticised Villalba's management last week, claiming she was not the 'strong leader' her division needed. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>Debt-laden <strong>Regent Inns</strong> caused some raised eyebrows yesterday with the surprise departure of chief executive Stephen Haupt and his finance director, Simon Rowe. </p> <p>No one from the company would comment but chairman Peter Savage, who will take on a role as \"part-time executive chairman\", said in a statement that the group was not in danger of missing market expectations when it reports full-year results on Tuesday. </p> <p>Few among Regent's shareholders are likely to mourn the loss of Messrs Haupt and Rowe, who persuaded many to back a share issue last November at 92p a share. Some investors felt mildly indignant that the issue was only at a small discount to the then share price. </p> <p>Investor confidence was further dented by profit warnings and share sales by founder David Franks. </p> <p>While the rest of the high street bar sector has been slashing prices, Mr Haupt, for far too long, spent vast sums on new sites - ratcheting up debt levels and adding to a clearly overcrowded market. </p> <p>Yesterday shares dipped as low as 35p before recovering to close flat at 37p on news of the two men's departure. The group, which has a market capitalisation of about \u00a340m, struggles under \u00a370m of debt. </p> <p>A spokesman for Regent said there were no accounting errors or breaches of banking covenants behind the departures. Their exit does leave a gaping hole at the top - particularly because it comes five months after the resignation of operations director Michael Thiele. </p> <p>Regent is not the obvious target for venture capital companies which are believed to be casting an eye over struggling high street bar chains. Its debt levels are high and it does not enjoy the cushion of property assets. It is nevertheless among the most cash-generative of chains and some analysts believe it could prove attractive as part of a consolidation package of the kind that US group GI Capital is said to be building following its recent acquisition of Yates Group. </p> <p>On a quiet day for blue chips, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> had a slight bounce from Thursday, closing up 7 points at 4545 after peaking at 4565.1 in the morning; 2.68m shares changed hands across the wider market, in line with an average Friday. </p> <p><strong>BSkyB</strong> led FTSE 100 gains, up 17p at 514p, following favourable comment from Citigroup Smith Barney, suggesting that the satellite broadcaster was well positioned to meet challenges posed by new distribution platforms and by Ofcom. </p> <p>Highly speculative <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> takeover rumours continued, with Philip Green and GUS among the names being linked to the supermarket chain. Its shares, which have been rallying since the start of the month, were up 6p at 283p. </p> <p><strong>Compass</strong>, which had \u00a31.7bn - a quarter of its value - wiped out following a profit downgrade on Thursday, again led the FTSE fallers. Shares closed down 8.75p at 230.5p, with Merrill Lynch said to have placed 15m shares at 233p. </p> <p>Compass non-executive director Peter Cawdron saw value buying 12,600 shares at 234p, following chief executive Mike Bailey who purchased 100,000 on Thursday. </p> <p>Reports that Compass had been forced to switch one of its big distributors in Europe spooked some investors in logistics group <strong>Exel</strong>, which closed down 95p at 695.5p </p> <p>Beyond the blue chip stocks, <strong>Aga Foodservice</strong> was up 6p at 234p on the back of first-half sales that exceeded analysts' estimates by \u00a34m. Particularly impressive were the British and European consumer businesses Aga-Rayburn, Rangemaster and Fired Earth, which showed strong margin gains. </p> <p><strong>GW Pharmaceuticals</strong> rose 18.5p at 125.5p after independent research from Exeter University suggested the benefits of cannabis-based therapy for multiple sclerosis - of the kind being developed by GW - could be seen over a treatment period of a year. </p> <p>A previous 15-week study from the university, which was published in the Lancet last year, proved inconclusive after patients' claims of relief from muscle stiffness could not be verified by physiotherapists.

  "In this job, it's your fingers and toes that are the first to go. Without gloves, Piers says, he'd only last five minutes and two hours at a time. \"It's pretty much the maximum. Our freezer sits at minus 10 - the optimum as far as the ice goes.\" <p>Which is why he's happy to dress up for the job. \"I wear snow boots and thermal socks. But I also have some lovely tights. I think they're meant for mountaineering. Over those, I wear ski trousers, which, without tights, can get quite scratchy. Although really it's because I just like wearing tights!\" </p> <p>He uses dubbin on his gloves to keep them soft and a big jacket designed for people who work in freezers. </p> <p>The ice comes by ship from Canada. \"We get 180 blocks at a time, which is about 10 tons of ice in one container. It takes three weeks to get to Dover and we pay around \u00a350 for a block.\" </p> <p>December is the busiest time for Piers when he and his co-carver can chip away at 100 blocks a week. </p> <p>The Ice Box started as a delivery cube business before the founders went to America and discovered the delights and potential of the vodka luge market. It's based in a couple of units in the New Covent Market in Vauxhall, south west London where there are three fridges: one for blocks, one for cubes and one to work in. </p> <p>Piers originally studied horticulture, then worked as a landscape designer in Blackburn. When he came to visit his sister in London, seven years ago, he got a job driving and delivering cubes and sculptures for the Ice Box. \"I was moving blocks around and there was this sculptor who was really under pressure. I was fascinated watching him work. My perception was it was all swans, cupids and cheesy stuff.\" </p> <p>In fact, it's now full-size Polos, something Piers made for VW to help them advertise their air conditioning. </p> <p>He starts with a raw block of ice and a chainsaw. \"It removes the largest quantity of ice in the shortest time,\" he says. He imagines that his skills might be transferable to stone, although he prefers working with ice because it's so much quicker. His toolbox contains sanders, drills, irons and a blow torch. </p> <p>He usually works from pictures and drawings, but sometimes he makes a template out of wood. \"I don't regard myself as an artist but I love making things.\" </p> <p>Many of Piers' sculptures end up at corporate parties where they are only good for one night but just in case you're thinking that you could end up swimming with the swans, each sculpture actually sits in a drip tray which has a tube running down into a bucket. \"Being cold is good for productivity,\" says Piers. </p> <p>\"I work with another carver and we're both in the same freezer but we don't go in there for a chat.\" </p> <p>Lots of short breaks are the best. \"Even breathing in warm air is good,\" he says. He always eats hot food at lunchtime. </p> <p>He says he tends not to shave very often because one of the hazards of the job is that he is constantly being covered by a spray of snow. </p> <p>\"Everything that comes off the block stays frozen but we're constantly brushing out snow,\" he says. \"I never take hot drinks in there. There are no industry standards about how long you can stay in the fridge, but if you stay in too long you get so cold that it takes you an hour to get warm again.\" </p> <p>He says the cold agrees with him and the environment appears to be healthier than the average over-heated germ-ridden office in winter. </p> <p>\"I haven't had a cold for five years: I think it's doing me good. I don't know whether I'm actually being naturally frozen. Maybe it's the cryogenic thing and I'll live 'til I'm 180.\" </p> <p>He says that he went into horticulture because that's what his dad used to do, but now he's doing something for himself and has fallen in love with ice. \"Ice has such a wow factor; it's tactile, it's ephemeral.\" </p> <p>Only on the loveliest of summer days does he think about gardening. \"In the winter I think I could be out there in the wet and cold,\" he says. \"Now I'm just getting cold!\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theicebox.com\">theicebox.com</a></p>",

  "Rubbishing cities is a popular sport. Not simply because of the garbage, graffiti, pollution, congestion and crowds people complain about - there is something about the very essence of cities and their inhabitants that offends. too. When Brighton and Hove succeeded in its bid to become a Millennial city, for instance, Julie Burchill declared that wanting to be a city was \"about as sensible and life-affirming as wanting to be a wart\". <p>Surveys have shown that, while around three-quarters of Britain's town- and country-dwellers are satisfied with their quality of life, only about 10% of urbanites are happy. According to Burchill, that's why you see so many of them on the Brighton seafront every weekend - \"thousands of Londoners set free for the day, blinking and smiling with surprise at all this light and space, poor mole-people above ground at last.\"</p> <p>But whatever people say about cities, their behaviour tells a different story. More people live in cities now than ever before. In the 1700s less than 10% of the world's population were city-dwellers. By 1900 the proportion had reached 25%; today it stands at around 50% and the trend is set to continue. Soon, two out of every three people on Earth will be living in a city. Will they all be complaining, or will the city have become a better place? </p> <p>At the very least, life in cities should offer more variety and be more fulfilling than a life spent scratching a bare living direct from the soil; it might even be more fun. But as cities have severed the ties that once bound people firmly to the land, so the links between urban and rural environments have become more important than ever. The inhabitants of today's cities are more utterly dependent on the services of nature than at any previous time in history. We tend to forget that, while London, Paris, Venice, New York and numerous other cities sustain and entertain millions of us, cities are monstrous parasites, consuming the resources of regions vastly larger than themselves and giving very little back. In fact, though cities today occupy only 2% of Earth's land surface, they consume more than 75% of its resources. The implications of that are powerfully illustrated by a concept environmental scientists developed during the 1990s: the ecological footprint.</p> <p>Question: \"What is 120 times the size of London?\" Answer: \"The land area required to supply London's needs.\" Having analysed the workings of London as though the city were a giant machine, consuming resources and spewing out wastes, researchers found that although the city itself occupies an area of only about 1,500 square kilometres, London actually requires roughly 20 million square kilometres of territory for its supplies and waste disposal. This is London's ecological footprint. Though the city is home to just 12% of Britain's population, it uses the equivalent of all Britain's productive land. In reality, of course, the horizons that supply London extend beyond the British Isles to the wheat prairies of Kansas, the soybean fields of the Mato Grosso, the forests of Scandinavia - and thousands of other locations.</p> <p>The ecological footprints of many cities have been assessed in this way, and the results are uniformly alarming. Vancouver, for instance, though rated highly in terms of the quality of life its half a million residents enjoy, has an ecological footprint more than 200 times the size of the city. The 29 largest cities of the Baltic Sea drainage system appropriate the resources of an area 565 times larger than the land they occupy. </p> <p>Furthermore, the assessment of ecological footprints puts a measure on the enormous disparities in resource appropriation that have opened up between the world's developed and developing regions. For example: each of North America's 300 million inhabitants consumes the resources of about 4.7 hectares (11.75 acres) per year on average - the equivalent of almost 10 soccer pitches. That is a huge, disproportionate chunk of Earth's surface, especially when compared with the average of just 0.4 hectare (about half the size of the centre court at Wimbledon) that each of India's one billion inhabitants manages on. And consider this: 80% of North Americans live in cities - many without even a windowbox, never mind a productive garden the size of 10 soccer pitches. In India only 30% of people live in cities; the remainder are sustained entirely by their notional half a tennis court.</p> <p>Meanwhile, of course, global resources have remained finite. Ominously, as the human population has risen above 6 billion, and cities have grown to accommodate an ever larger proportion of them, the ecologically productive land \"available\" to each person has decreased, from about 5.6 hectares per person in 1900 to three hectares in 1950, and down to no more than 1.5 hectares now. That means that the ecological footprint of the average North American (4.7 hectares) is more than three times his or her share of Earth's resources. So, if living standards everywhere were raised to levels that the average North American enjoys, we would need three planets to provide for them all. That's not an option, but redressing the balance between urban and rural environments could help.</p> <p>Given the success of the evolutionary trajectory humanity pursued for the first few million years - no other species has achieved such total dominance of the global environment - cities are a complete contradiction. It is biology that drives evolution and, from a biological point of view, cities are a seriously bad idea. The dangers of disease multiply when people are crowded together, and our aversion to squalor and unpleasant odours is a measure of the depth at which an innate acknowledgement of those dangers is set in our evolutionary history. We are social animals, true enough, but there are limits, and our hunting and gathering ancestors probably had the numbers about right. They were nomadic, moving around in groups of up to 40 or so, and never staying long enough in one place for pathogens to build up to potentially deadly levels. But cities have been - quite literally - the breeding grounds of disease.</p> <p>Bacterial and viral diseases are the price humanity has paid to live in large and densely populated cities. Virtually all the familiar infectious diseases have evolved only since the advent of agriculture, permanent settlement and the growth of cities. Most were transferred to humans from animals - especially domestic animals. Measles, for instance, is akin to rinderpest in cattle; influenza came from pigs; smallpox is related to cowpox. Humans share 296 diseases with domestic animals. </p> <p>Thus, until comparatively recent times, cities had a well-earned reputation for being unhealthy places. In the early 19th century half the children born in Manchester died before they were five years old; in London half died before the age of three, and conditions were even worse in Vienna and Stockholm, where half died before they were two. No wonder demographers and historians write of the \"urban graveyard effect\". Deaths exceeded births in all great cities. The amazing thing is that cities continued to grow. Despite their deathly reputation, more and more people wanted to live in them.</p> <p>Between 1551 and 1801, for instance, the population of London grew more than tenfold, from 80,000 to 865,000, even though deaths consistently exceeded births throughout those 250 years. Left to its own reproductive capacity, London would have died out. It survived and grew by attracting thousands of migrants from the countryside, where death rates were generally 50% lower than in the cities, and birth rates 13% higher. Clearly, living conditions were healthier in the countryside. But, as agriculture and cottage industries such as spinning and weaving were mechanised, redundant labour had no choice but to seek employment elsewhere - and the industrial cities beckoned. </p> <p>In the 30 years to 1910, Vienna's population trebled to more than 2 million in this way; the population of Paris soared from 2.25 million to 4.8 million during roughly the same period, and London gained 3.5 million new residents. New York grew from a city of 1.9 million in 1875 to become the home of nearly 8 million people by 1925, making it the world's largest city. New York was still leading in 1950, with 12.3 million inhabitants; and again in 1960, with 14.2 million; but by 1970 the greatest growth had moved around the globe. Japan's postwar economic achievements had pushed Tokyo into first place, with 16.5 million inhabitants, a position it still holds. At the time of writing, second place is taken by Mexico City, an ascendancy indicating that economic vitality is no longer a primary determinant of city growth. Huge cities have been appearing in all parts of the world - in poor countries as well as in the regions of greatest wealth. In 1970 only three cities - Tokyo, New York and Shanghai - had 10 million or more inhabitants; 30 years later there were 19 of them, 14 in the developing world. And the trend is set to continue: by 2020 at least 23 cities will have passed the 10 million mark, all but four in developing countries. By then, several cities in the developing world are likely to have populations of more than 20 million. In all, nearly 600 cities will have a million or more inhabitants by 2020. Of those, more than 400 will be in developing countries.</p> <p>The quality of life for many in the cities of the developing world is desperately low, with squatter or slum housing being the norm rather than the exception. But, contrary to the idealised western view of the countryside as a haven to which city-dwellers yearn to escape, conditions are far worse in the rural areas. The cities may be poor, but the countryside is poorer still.</p> <p>The brutal fact is that, while one-third or more of city-dwellers in the developing world live on or below the poverty line, only about one-third of the rural population lives above it. A typical study of urbanisation in the developing world concludes that despite appalling housing conditions, lack of fresh water and services, minimal health care and few chances of finding a job, the urban poor are on average \"better off than their rural cousins, on almost every indicator of social and economic well-being\". </p> <p>Better off? Well-being? Don't ask how the lives of these impoverished city-dwellers compare with those of the 90% of British urbanites who are dissatisfied with their quality of life. Only note that, for many millions of people, cities are the solution, not the problem.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>John Reader is the author of Cities (William Heinemann, \u00a320)</p>",

  "<p>Sebasti\u00e3o Ribeiro Salgado was born in Brazil on February 8, 1944, in a small town of 16,000 inhabitants, Aimor\u00e9s, in the state of Minas Gerais. In the 1940s more than 70% of this region was still covered by the foliage and trees of the Atlantic Forest, one of the 25 environmental \"hot spots\" on our planet. At that time this coastal Brazilian forest was twice as big as all of France; today it is reduced to only 7% of what it is was then, and in Sebasti\u00e3os birthplace the forest is even more sparse, at 0.3% of its initial size.</p> <p>When Sebasti\u00e3o was young, the town of Aimor\u00e9s offered only the first part of secondary school, so he left in 1960 to live in Vitoria, a coastal town 185 kilometers away that was the capital of the state of Espirito Santo. There he completed his secondary education in 1962. The next year he went to the university to study economics and finished in 1967, the year he married L\u00e9lia Deluiz Wanick. They are the parents of two boys, Juliano, 28, and 23-year-old Rodrigo who has Downs Syndrome. They are also the grandparents of a six-year-old boy, Flavio.</p> <p>They left for S\u00e3o Paulo where Sebasti\u00e3o received a Masters in economics and L&amp;eacure;lia finished her twelve years of conservatory training in piano. In 1969 they moved to Paris, and Sebasti\u00e3o studied for a doctorate in economics while L\u00e9lia began her architectural studies at the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts.</p> <p>In 1971 they moved again, to London, where Sebasti\u00e3o worked as an economist for the International Coffee Organization. He travelled often to Africa on missions affiliated with the World Bank. It was then that he first began taking his first photographs. On his return to London these images began to preoccupy him, and he abandoned his career as an economist. At the beginning of 1973 he and his wife returned to Paris so that he could begin his life as a photographer.</p> <p>At first Sebasti\u00e3o worked as a freelancer and joined the Sygma photographic agency in 1974. During the few months he remained at Sygma he photographed stories in Portugal, Angola and Mozambique. He joined the Gamma photographic agency in 1975 and worked on many stories throughout almost all of Africa, Europe and Latin America. In 1977 he began a long photographic essay on the Indians and peasants of Latin America. During this period L\u00e9lia also finished her architectural studies and continued her post-graduate work in urban planning.</p> <p>In 1979 Sebasti\u00e3o left Gamma and joined Magnum Photos, where he would stay for 15 years. Along with many reportages in several countries for a variety of European and American magazines, in 1984 he finished his work on the Indians and peasants of Latin America. This work was published as his first book, Other Americas, in France, Spain and the United States.</p> <p>From 1984 to the beginning of 1986 he worked, along with the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, on an 18-month project documenting the African famine. He published two books, Sahel, l\u00c0homme en d&amp;eactute;tresse (Sahel: Man in Distress) in France and Sahel el fin del camino (Sahel the End of the Road) in Spain. The two books and a number of photographic exhibitions were created specifically to support the efforts of Doctors Without Borders.</p> <p>From 1986-92 Sebasti\u00e3o travelled to 23 countries to create a series of photographs on the end of the age of large-scale industrial manual labour. In 1993 he published the book Workers: an archeology of the industrial era in eight countries. More than 100,000 copies of the book were printed, and a large exhibition has been circulating throughout the world to more than 60 museums so far.</p> <p>In 1993 Sebasti\u00e3o began another series of photographs, inspired by Workers, which would be called Migrations. This project would bring him to 43 countries, on every continent, to document the peoples who abandoned the countryside for the cities. As part of the project, for example, he photographed nine megalopolises which had experienced enormous increases in population during the last two decades due to various forms of migration. The books, Migrations, and Portraits of Children of the Migration, were also published in 8 countries with more than 220,000 copies in print. Eight sets of a large exhibition were simultaneously produced to be shown throughout the world. As well, more than 3,000 sets of 60 posters were created to be shown in union halls, churches, cultural centres, schools, etc. An educational program also was produced to accompany the exhibition in several countries. More than 3 million people are estimated to have seen this work.</p> <p>During this time other books have also been published: Les cheminots (France, 1989); An Uncertain Grace (USA, Great Britain, Japan, France, Portugal, Italy, 1990); The Best Photos (Brazil, 1992); Photopoche (France, 1993); Terra (Brazil, France, Portugal, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, 1997); Photopoche Serra Pelada (France, 1999).</p> <p>Almost all of these books, as well as most of the exhibitions, were conceived and created by L\u00e9lia Deluiz Wanick. L\u00e9lia and Sebasti\u00e3o also formed Amazonas Images in 1994, the year when Sebasti\u00e3o left Magnum Photos. Amazonas Images is a press agency which may be the smallest photographic agency in the world, representing only one photographer. L\u00e9lia and Sebasti\u00e3o also have worked together since 1991 on the restoration of a small part of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil to its natural state. In 1998 they succeeded in making this land a nature preserve and created Instituto Terra, which includes an educational centre for the environment. More than 500,000 trees have been planted, and the project is at the heart of a much larger community effort focusing on sustainable development in the Rio Doce valley.</p> <p>Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the USA. He has received numerous prizes, including several Honorary Doctorates and many other accolades for his photographic work.</p>",
  "<p>The world is in peril, both nature and humanity. Yet this cry of alarm is heard so often that it is now largely ignored. International conferences are routinely organized to debate global warming, sustainable development, water resources, destruction of forests, endemic poverty, the AIDS epidemic, housing needs and other facets of the global crisis. But the daily struggle for survival of the majority of humanity and the appetite for comfort and profit of the minority mean that, in practice, these fundamental problems are tackled only superficially. We have lost touch with the essence of life on earth.</p> <p>The modern notion that humanity and nature are somehow separate is absurd. Our relationship with nature - with ourselves - has broken down. As the most developed species, humanity may have a special, often dominant, relationship with nature, but it is no less part of nature. Indeed, we cannot survive outside it. And yet accelerated urbanisation over the past century has distanced humanity from the very animal and plant sources of life itself. We are living in disharmony with the elements that comprise the universe, as if we too were not similarly formed, as if we were purely rational beings. We are disregarding the spiritual and instinctive qualities that until now have ensured our survival. We assume grave risks when we distance ourselves from our natural roots, roots which in the past always made us feel part of the whole.</p> <p>Only recent generations have come to recognize the real possibility of nature's collapse. We live today on a planet that can die. We use nuclear energy in various fields, in our daily life and in scientific programs, but we do not fully understand the risks posed by secondary effects and by nuclear waste. And yet, we have accumulated unthinkable numbers of nuclear weapons that can be used in war or by terrorists. We are also threatened by environmental disaster. Industrial farming and large-scale cattle ranching are using techniques that decimate wildlife habitats, while soil and water are poisoned by excessive use of chemicals. What we produce is now merely a commodity to be traded. We are damaging the stratosphere and destroying the last portions of the tropical forests, with the parallel reduction of the photosynthesis that assures our survival. Our very existence is in danger.</p> <p>This is tragically mirrored in the current state of humanity. Immense wealth has been created through the labour of the entire world's population, but it is concentrated in the hands of all too few people, spawning tensions both within affluent societies and between a handful of rich countries and the rest of the world. We produce more food than ever and yet millions die of hunger. And in recent decades we have witnessed the worst acts of genocide of our history .</p> <p>Throughout the 20th century, accelerating population growth and economic development destroyed the natural habitats of most of temperate zones of the northern hemisphere. Now the focus of destruction has shifted to mega-diverse tropical regions. The 25 regions of the world (or \"hotspots\", a concept developed by the British ecologist Norman Myers in the late 1980s) that account for more than half of the planet's species have already lost around 90% of their natural habitat; this extraordinary biodiversity is now facing its last stand in a mere 1.4% of the world's land surface.</p> <p>Only in wilderness zones does biodiversity still flourish. These drylands, coldlands and tropical forests, which represent around 46% of earth's land area, contain as endemic only a tiny 1.6% of the world's plants and 2.3% of non-fish vertebrates. But they are crucial to maintaining regional ecosystems (such as water cycles) and even global ones (for example, carbon sequestration). These are also the last places on earth where we can understand our origins as a species and find biological diversity in a pristine state.</p> <p>Thus, for all the damage already caused to the environment, a world of purity, even innocence, can still be found in these wilderness areas. As an attempt to reconnect our species with our planet, I now intend to explore this world in order to record the unblemished faces of nature and humanity: how nature looked without men and women; and how humanity and nature long coexisted in what today we now call ecological balance.</p> <p>This project is designed to reconnect us to how the world was before humanity altered it almost beyond recognition. It is a project that follows on from the long photographic research that led to my books and exhibitions, Other Americas, Sahel: L'Homme en D\u00e9tresse, Workers and Migrations. In these early undertakings, I did not focus specifically on the environment, but I was constantly confronted by dismaying evidence of the dramatic deterioration of humanity's relationship with nature. All too often, extreme poverty and migration were both a cause and a result of the degradation and pollution of nature's resources.</p> <p>This is also a project born of an initiative that my wife, L\u00e9lia Deluiz Wanick, and I took to reforest 1,500 acres of land that we own in Brazil with the original species of the Atlantic Forest, one of the 25 \"hotspots\" of the planet. From the beginning, the idea was to create a pilot project that could serve as a model for re-greening deforested and depleted land across Brazil. To ensure that our experience was shared, we also founded the Instituto Terra to provide a practical environmental education to municipal officials, teachers, farmers and students. We have already planted half a million trees, while our school has graduated its first generations of students. We believe Instituto Terra is demonstrating that it is possible to turn back the clock and recover what seemed lost forever.</p> <p>I conceive this project as a potential path towards humanity's rediscovery of itself in nature. I have named it Genesis because, as far as possible, I want to return to the beginnings of our planet: to the air, water and fire that gave birth to life; to the animal species that have resisted domestication and are still \"wild\"; to the remote tribes whose \"primitive\" way of life is largely untouched; and to surviving examples of the earliest forms of human settlement and organisation. This voyage represents a form of planetary anthropology. Yet it is also designed to propose that this uncontaminated world must be preserved and, where possible, be expanded so that development is not automatically commensurate with destruction.</p> <p>My photographs will be divided in four chapters. But since this will be a journey of exploration and discovery, I have a better idea of where I will look than what I will find.</p>",
  "<p>Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado is talking about the marine iguanas with which he spent three months, and he can barely contain himself. They are giant lizards, or tiny dinosaurs, with claws like diamant\u00e9 gloves. \"Oh boy!\" he says. \"They were so incredible, and they're completely different from one island to another, and some places there are thousands of them, and when you see these guys, it probably took them hundreds of thousands, millions, of years to be what they are: at first they were land iguanas, then they learned how to swim and how to dive and drink salt water, and they developed glands to eliminate salt water - incredibly sophisticated.\" He finally takes a breath. \"Soooo sweet! There is a picture of one iguana embracing another.\" </p> <p>Salgado has just spent three months in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where Darwin visited 169 years ago and refined his theories of evolution. For Salgado, this is the first stop on an eight-year project called Genesis, all of which will appear in Guardian Weekend. He says it is the last project he will undertake on such a scale. </p> <p>The great Brazilian photographer, now 60, has given his life to long-term projects - workers, landless peasants, children, migrants. He took his camera where few photographers bothered or dared to go. His most famous photographs are of the garimpeiros, the mud-soaked prospectors who climbed up and down open-cast Brazilian gold mines, hoping against hope to find a nugget of gold in their buckets of dirt. These pictures, taken in 1986, look like stills from a Cecil B DeMille movie of Dante's Inferno - an epic vision of hell with 50,000 extras and no stars. </p> <p>His last major project was Migrations, or Exodus, as he prefers to call it. Over seven years, he took photographs of migrants from Africa, Asia and South America, many of whom had fled ethnic and religious conflict and genocidal regimes. Often his subjects, particularly the children, stare at the camera - strong, confrontational, giddy, laughing, heroic, even in their despair. Sometimes they are too ill or frightened to do so. Arthur Miller called Salgado's photographs an act of deep devotion. </p> <p>But Exodus left him questioning his faith in humanity. He had seen so much man-made suffering. The idealist began to have his doubts about our essential goodness. \"I was injured in my heart and my spirit. For me, it was terrible what I saw. I came away from this with incredible despair.\" He was desperate to find something that would restore faith. </p> <p>Hence Genesis. Yes, we may already have destroyed 50% of the planet, but Salgado wants to show us what we have left, and what we stand to lose if we don't take care. \"In the end, the only heritage we have is our planet, and I have decided to go to the most pristine places on the planet and photograph them in the most honest way I know, with my point of view, and of course it is in black and white, because it is the only thing I know how to do. I want to see if I can put a kind of virginity in these pictures, if you can say that, and to show 100% respect to nature and the animals.\" </p> <p>Salgado was given permission by the National Park of the Gal\u00e1pagos and the Darwin Foundation to go anywhere on the islands. Although tourism is allowed and fishing permitted in the surrounding waters, both are heavily regulated. He hired a boat and spent most of the time with only the birds and animals for company. After a lifetime photographing humans, it was a radical departure. In these pictures, you can almost hear the silence, and feel the heat rising from the lava. </p> <p>His work has always been about identity and belonging (or not belonging). Salgado is a half-Jewish Portuguese Lithuanian Brazilian, and himself a migrant. He was born in a rural community in Brazil, the sixth child of a cattle rancher, moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, where he studied to become an economist, and finally fled to Paris in 1969 to escape Brazil's military dictatorship. He did a PhD in economics, then worked as an economist for the International Coffee Organisation. After decades away, he is now back in Brazil. </p> <p>He was almost 30 when he took up photography. He started playing around with his wife's camera on a trip to Africa in 1973. That was that - he decided to change careers. He was invited to join Magnum in 1979. Now he has his own agency, Amazonas Images. </p> <p>His work is fearlessly political - life is political, so of course photography will be, too. He has never shied away from bullets or death. Some of Salgado's most haunting photographs document a demonstration by landless peasants in 1996 that resulted in the police killing 19 protesters. Other pictures belonging to the same series show 12,000 marchers breaking open the paddock to a vast estate and reclaiming the land from an absentee landlord. </p> <p>Genesis is also about land and belonging - this time, to the planet. It seems ironic that he has begun Genesis on the Gal\u00e1pagos. After all, it is on this archipelago off the coast of Ecuador that Darwin's work pretty much did for creationism. I ask him if he has belatedly found religion. \"No,\" he says. \"I'm not a religious person. The language of photography is symbolic.\" As is the title. </p> <p>His own spiritual regeneration has been aided by another long-term project, the Instituto Terra. Back home in Brazil, Salgado has spent 13 years rebuilding a rainforest where his father's cattle used to graze. \"All the birds are coming back, the river is flowing again, the environment is working, and all this has made such a difference to my relationship with nature. My life has completely changed,\" he says. Sometimes friends visit him and are shocked by what they see - the snakes and scorpions and crocodiles. \"We have become so far away from our planet. We see nature as something that has to be tamed or eradicated. We think we are superior beings, completely rational. And, my God, the next generation, what kind of planet are we leaving them?\" </p> <p>His work has often been called cinematic, and perhaps following Exodus with Genesis can be seen as another modern-day movie convention - the prequel. This is the world before we conquered it. Some of the pictures of the iguanas and the tortoises look as if they could have been conjured up by the props department for an Ed Wood B-movie. The creatures look so prehistoric, so Jurassic Park, comically unreal. But Salgado's point is that they are real and they have survived where we haven't meddled. </p> <p>His three months in the Gal\u00e1pagos were wonderful, he says. \"I was in front of one giant tortoise I am 100% sure was there when Darwin came 170 years ago. And as I photographed this giant tortoise, it looked at me with the experience and authority of 200 years. Oh boy! What a privilege. It gave me so much pleasure to be alone with these animals, just looking at them. They - the cormorants and iguanas and sea lions - allowed me to participate in their space, and that is something fantastic.\" </p> <p>He talks with awe of the resilience of the green sea turtles, the albatrosses that show such kindness to their life companions, and the sea lions so curious and affectionate that they lie down next to you, their body touching yours. He has already visited gorillas in Africa for the second stage of his project, and is about to spend time with whales in Argentina. I tell him that there seems to be so much hope in this project and he is pleased. \"This is the point for me, that there is a hope. So many times I've photographed stories that show the degradation of the planet. I had one idea to go and photograph the factories that were polluting, and to see all the deposits of garbage. But, in the end, I thought the only way to give us an incentive, to bring hope, is to show the pictures of the pristine planet - to see the innocence. And then we can understand what we must preserve.\"</p>",
  "It won't be as bad as you think. There is no need for the world in 2020 to be one in which nation fights nation over the contents of a drying river bed. There is no need for the world's poorest people to be dying for want of clean water, nor for droughts to cause mass starvation as whole regions see their food supplies wither away in waterless heat. That might happen, but if we can summon the political and economic will, we can avert it. <p>In fact, we can address the most crucial area of water scarcity - finding enough water to feed the world - without ever getting our hands wet, thanks to the concept of \"virtual water\", which has nothing to do with computers. We will be helped in getting water to the world by social trends that are already underway, such as the flight from the country to the cities. And the rich - that's us - will probably not be as selfish with water as one might fear. We are likely to continue to adapt our usage of the water we are endowed with, and we are likely to be putting water back into the environment - by using less fresh water in farming, for example.</p> <p>Water shortages don't pose serious problems to gardeners in Hampshire or to Californian homeowners with pools to fill. The rich can find a way through. Their water suppliers can build a desalination plant; they can use their water more carefully; they can sometimes even get farmers to stop using water for a while.</p> <p>The people who suffer when water is in short supply are the poor. About one in six of the world's 6.5 billion people do not have a safe and secure water supply, and most poor families are short of water for the daily needs we take for granted. But the water-saving measures open to the rich are not open to them. If you get your water from a well you cannot stick a brick in the toilet cistern to use less water when you flush. Farmers in poor countries cannot stop farming. If they did, their families would die. And because poor communities cannot change the way they manage water, they are the ones who will suffer if water is scarce in 2020.</p> <p>The key to avoiding catastrophic water shortages is bringing people out of poverty, and the world is getting richer. At the moment there are between 1 billion and 1.5 billion rich people in the world; by 2020 there could be 2 billion to 2.5 billion. That would not have the desired effect if the world's population was expanding at the rate the \"scary science\" of the 1970s postulated. Fortunately, it is not. In 1994, demographers at the UN population conference in Cairo argued that the world's population would level off in the second half of the 21st century at around 50% higher than the current level. While this increase might sound like a great deal, it is within our capabilities to make sure the world has the water it needs. Food production accounts for 90% of water consumption, but there is sufficient water in the global system to meet the food needs of a world population at that level, and farmers have shown over the past century they can mobilise the world's natural resources - including water and energy - to meet huge increases in demand for food. </p> <p>Energy, in fact, is likely to be a far more crucial factor than water in slowing down production, even in agriculture. Water will not be such a problem because we will have achieved major economies in water use, which will mean more production per drop. Production in regions that currently can manage only low yields is likely to improve by between 50% and 100%.</p> <p>Why, then, do headline writers insist on the notion of water as source of crisis and conflict? In part, because it is easier to see water as a geographic feature, a seemingly static resource: we think of water as being lakes and rivers. In fact, water is everywhere, in many forms. In the past half-century, for example, we have discovered that the industrialised economies in temperate regions, such as Europe and North America, have surplus soil water resources. Soil water is the effective rainfall used to produce a wide range of rainfed crops, and especially the staple grains that are needed to meet the world's food needs. Though it rarely comes up in discussions of water crises, soil water is what makes possible well over half the world's crop production. Water is present in the food we produce, as well: not as an ingredient, but as an element in its production (remember, 90% of water consumption takes place during food production). </p> <p>To understand the full implications of that, take the case of the desert regions of the Middle East and North Africa. Those areas entered a period of dangerous strategic water deficits in the early 1970s. If ever there was a good time to suffer a severe water shortage, that was it. </p> <p>The early 1970s saw the farmers of North America and Europe putting staple grains on the world market at half their production cost. They are still doing that, aided by production and export subsidies that will be difficult to unpick within the next 20 years. It takes so much water to produce those vast mountains of grain that when they are exported they amount, in effect, to a global trade in water. That process can spectacularly fix water shortages. It takes 1,000 tonnes of water to produce a tonne of grain, so by importing grain, water-scarce economies can avoid the stress of trying to develop their own water sources for food production. And because 20% of the world's agricultural production is traded internationally, farmers and traders can move this \"virtual water\" in volumes and over distances beyond the wildest imaginings of engineers.</p> <p>The trade in virtual water addresses the biggest water challenge for both individuals and nations facing water scarcity: how to use water to produce enough food. Virtual water also eases the pressure that irrigated agriculture places on water in the environment. It is true that large-scale irrigation is an inefficient use of water, but the trade in virtual water means those regions where irrigation is crucial can put water back into the environment.</p> <p>What of the 10% of water used for activities other than agriculture? Come 2020, domestic water will still be in short supply for the very poor, who will have neither the resources nor the quality of government to address their problems. But the issue is not that there is too little water, rather that too little effort has been expended on finding economic solutions to the problem. If strong, diverse economies can be established in the poor countries, that will enable investment to ensure the necessary supplies of fresh water for non-agricultural use. And virtual water will account for the volumes needed for food production.</p> <p>Technology will also help the world make water available for domestic and commercial use. Desalination costs, for example, have fallen over the past five years, and the process can provide affordable water for the 70% of the world's population that lives close to major bodies of water. At a cost of around 30p per cubic metre, desalinated water is well within the price range of those living in industrialised economies. At present, the poor can pay nearly \u00a32 per cubic metre for water that is not even safe to drink.</p> <p>The problem with desalination is that it depends on a secure energy supply, and energy futures are much more uncertain than water futures. The water future could be constrained by the availability of affordable energy. So although we can project that by 2025, and certainly by 2050, a significant proportion of the world's population will be augmenting their freshwater supplies using desalination technology, the possible brake on the process is that energy prices will rise as the economies of east and south Asia expand in the next two decades, exerting new demands on the global energy supply. It is impossible at this point to guess how high a priority of water manufacture will be in an energy-short world. </p> <p>As an optimist, I believe the manufacture of fresh water is such a huge imperative that the world's leaders will have to address it. I do not believe the politics of allocating energy to water creation will be a problem. And desalination is not the only option. Each drop of London tap water has been through several people; there is no reason why domestic water cannot be reused in the developing world, where economies facing water scarcity are increasingly treating waste water. Some countries gain 20% of their supply from reuse. </p> <p>Only 10% of water is for non-agricultural use: we could, in theory, get 70% of that back by treating waste water (although there are social problems with water recycling - some people will not drink water that has already been drunk by someone else). So there is no need for a global water shortage. And there is no need for conflict over water. But still we find it difficult to understand the issues surrounding water scarcity, and because we do not understand them we find it difficult to address them all. We do not include soil water in our reckonings, even though it is the major source of water for rural economies. We forget the equalising role of virtual water, which moves commodities that require huge amounts of water to produce from the water-rich to the water-scarce economies. And there is too little understanding of the role of socio-economic development in giving the water-short access to virtual water. </p> <p>The problem is that what we need to do to supply water to all runs counter to one of the most deeply rooted human needs: the desire for familiarity and security. Most people - western consumers of expensive foreign bottled waters and imported delicacies aside - feel intuitively insecure if they cannot drink local water and eat locally produced food. Across the world, the hundreds of millions who comprise the rural poor do not have the levels of consumer and economic sophistication that are second nature to people in the industrialised world. As a result they are uneasy about accepting any dependence on what they regard as a complex and unfathomable economic system.</p> <p>But surely it is easy to inform people they have nothing to fear and everything to gain? Sadly, no. The politicians responsible for more than half the world's rural population do not have the resources or political capital, nor the economic policy options, to confront the beliefs of the rural poor. For those people, new ways of thinking and new approaches to water are not an option. There are no other jobs. Once again, however, there is a bright side. It has been estimated that by 2025 two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities, where life is more water efficient. The policeman in Nairobi, the call-centre worker in Mumbai and the teacher in Mexico City will use negligible volumes of water each day but can be far better paid than their counterparts in the fields.</p> <p>A building occupying a site of a hectare could accommodate 1,000 workers. Those people could generate an annual turnover of \u00a330m, but would use only 10,000 cubic meters of water each year. If that hectare were to be used as a wheat field, it might use the same amount of water, but would generate a turnover of less than \u00a32,000 per year and would only support one tenth of one job. So the key to efficient use of water, through the deployment of virtual water, is job creation and removing people from poverty.</p> <p>The challenge facing the world between now and 2020 is making sure poor people have access to small volumes of safe water - the 10% needed to keep families healthy and employable. And the best way to do that is to develop diverse economies. That is the powerful invisible process that will enable the water rich to improve the lives of the millions of people living in economic and water poverty.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Tony Allan is professor of geography at SOAS in London.

  "China's rise through America's eyes: \"When a speeding freight train is heading towards you, you either get on board or you get out of the way. We want to get on board.\" The locomotive is China, whose economy is forecast to become the second largest in the world by 2016 and to have overtaken America by 2041. \"We\" are the people of South Carolina, the southern US state whose textile-based economy is under increasing threat from cheap labour in the People's Republic. And getting on board means trying to get the Chinese to invest in the state rather than trying to keep them out by erecting protective trade barriers. <p>The speaker is Mark Sanford, South Carolina's Republican governor, who has travelled to Beijing to attract Chinese investment to revive its beleaguered economy. He is speaking at a private dinner in a club so exclusive that it doesn't have a name, just an unmarked red door in a windowless wall. The late Deng Xiaoping used to come here to relax, but today the mix of privacy and transparency has become an irresistible magnet to China's nouveau riche. </p> <p>In his Southern drawl, Sanford speaks elegiacally of a knitwear factory that closed in his neighbouring state of North Carolina. This closure, and others like it, have led to a heated debate about attempts to restrict \"off-shoring\". Sanford explains that his goal is to attract investment from Chinese companies such as Haier, which built a fridge factory in South Carolina in 2000, completing an integrated system of production and sales with its design centre in Los Angeles and trade centre in New York. He speaks about turning his state into a \"poster-boy\" for globalisation, a Chinese gateway into America, reversing the sense of an inexorable flow of jobs and business from the US to China, and creating a \"win-win\" scenario. The Chinese roar with approval at his speech: they like this new face of America, as supplicant rather than bully. </p> <p>But Sanford is a lonely voice in preaching the need to woo China, despite the overwhelming force of the statistics: China has a population of more than a billion, an economy that is growing year-on-year by more than 8%, and had a trade surplus with the US of $124bn in 2003; Chinese imports into the US are outpacing American exports to China by more than five to one. More typical, perhaps, are the words of Roger W Robinson Jr, the former chairman of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the official body charged with assessing the security implications of the trade between the US and China. \"The US-China economic relationship is heavily imbalanced and undermining our long-term economic health,\" he said at the launch of the commission's last report. John Edwards, the vice-presidential nominee who represents the neighbouring state of North Carolina in the Senate, has taken a much tougher line than Sanford: he promises to review US trade agreements and investigate workers' rights abuses in China.</p> <p>China's growing economic power is doing much more than harming America's trade figures. Its development needs huge quantities of oil, forcing up prices on the world market. That is another big campaign issue in the world's most oil-hungry nation. According to the International Energy Agency, China will generate one-third of global incremental demand for oil between 2002 and 2004. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times has argued: \"As Asian growth continues, the global balance between demand and supply will continue to be tight, unless (or until) a vast increase in investment takes place. With such tight markets, relatively modest disruptions could lead to explosive jumps in oil prices, as happened twice in the 1970s.\"</p> <p>If the US Democrats are exercised by China's economic threat, the Republicans have focused on its military one. President George Bush's first intelligence briefing from the CIA listed China as one of three strategic threats, along with terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The thin red mist descends and China becomes, in the neo-con imagination, a Soviet Union of the east, intent on establishing puppet regimes, governed by a modern mandate from heaven. Though not all would go as far as denouncing Deng Xiaoping as a \"chain smoking communist dwarf\", as the rightwing firebrand Pat Buchanan did, there is a segment of the US political class that recoils at reports of double-digit increases in Chinese military spending, an intense focus on military modernisation and the simmering tensions over Taiwan. </p> <p>Back in 1997, Paul Wolfowitz, the neo-conservative flag-carrier who is now deputy defence secretary, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs that compared the rise of China at the dawn of the 21st century to the rise of Germany a century earlier. He characterised China as \"a country that felt it had been denied its place in the sun\", that believed it had been mistreated by the other powers, and that was determined to achieve its rightful place by nationalistic assertiveness. He warned there may be another world war. But rather than a hot war, the two have engaged in a competition for influence in the Asian region.</p> <p>The establishment of US bases in central Asia, America's tightening defence ties with Japan and Australia, and its growing relationship with India are all seen by China's elite as part of Washington's design to keep them in check. China's response has been to bend over backwards to prove it is no threat either to the US or its neighbours. Li Junru, the vice president of the Central Party School, one of the Communist part institutions, has said the policy of heping jueqi (literally \"merging precipitously in a peaceful way\") means other nations need not fear. \"China's rise will not damage the interests of other Asian countries,\" he told the Beijing Review. \"That is because as China rises, it provides a huge market for its neighbours. At the same time, the achievements of China's development will allow it to support the progress of others in the region.\" He talks of the Chinese developing free trade areas and security organisations for the region on the model of the European Union and Nato. As part of this strategy, Beijing has resolved virtually all its land border disputes with its neighbours: it has signed a non-aggression pact with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean); it is working to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue; it is signing a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Asean which includes free trade agreements and economic aid; and it is conducting joint military exercises with Russia, Kyrgyzstan, India and Pakistan. </p> <p>The American analyst Robert W Radtke, writing in the Christian Science Monitor, argued that China's soft sell appeals to America's allies in Asia: \"China's peaceful rise was introduced to Asia by Chinese President Hu Jintao on his tour of south-east Asia in October - on the heels of President Bush's visit to the region that month. The contrast in tone between the two leaders couldn't have been more striking. In short, China's message was, 'We're here to help,' while the US message was 'You're either with us or against us' in the war on terror. It's not hard to imagine which was the more effective diplomatic strategy.\"</p> <p>But the Chinese will not push this competition too far: their biggest fear is that the neo-cons in Washington will encourage Bush to ratchet up the pressure over Taiwan, whose government has been making noises about declaring independence from the mainland, to the displeasure of the Beijing administration. Since the spat early in Bush's term when a US spy-plane crashed into a Chinese fighter, relations between the world's two leading powers have thawed. Beijing has provided Washington with useful intelligence and, like Russia, used the war on terror as an excuse to damn its own separatist movements. Even over Iraq, the Chinese supported the first UN resolution and kept a low profile over the second. During Kosovo, by contrast, Chinese spokesmen were on a 24-hour rota condemning Nato's illegal action. This time the risk of causing a rift with the Americans was judged too great. </p> <p>American policy towards China is trapped between an imperative for engagement and a preference for containment. Earlier this year US policymakers welcomed a Chinese trade delegation for a multi-billion dollar buying and spending spree, during which the Chinese were to look at making investments. Within days of the delegation's departure, however, the US threatened sanctions that would make the purchases impossible. And in the security sphere the US is seeking the People's Republic's help on the proliferation of WMD in North Korea at the same time as pushing a missile defence shield that could launch a new arms race between the two nations. </p> <p>What is becoming clear is that the Chinese are no longer easily manipulated. China's welfare is so intimately woven into the international order that its welfare affects the hope and dreams of others across the world. China is already on its way to becoming America's chief banker: the $400bn of foreign reserves it has accumulated allows the US to sustain its astronomical budget deficit. If Beijing stopped buying dollars, the US currency would collapse. The security analyst Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg has even compared the Chinese hold on the dollar to a nuclear weapon: \"Breaking the dollar would be the functional equivalent of using a nuclear weapon,\" he wrote in 2003. \"The possession of such a capability cannot be ignored by the weaker party.\" </p> <p>Because of this mutual dependence it is unlikely that Wolfowitz's predictions of world war will come true. But as China rises, the balance of power will continue to shift to the east and more and more Americans will follow Sanford's example: approaching China with a begging bowl rather than a stick. China itself will face intense pressures over the coming years - unemployment, labour unrest, environmental problems and financial problems - but any problems in the People's Republic will also threaten American interests. </p> <p>Maybe the neocons have got it wrong. Perhaps the only thing worse for the US than a China that is too strong in 2020 will be one that is too weak.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Mark Leonard is director of the Foreign Policy Centre (<a href=\"http://www.fpc.org.uk\">fpc.org.uk</a>)</p> <p><b>How China is wooing the world</b></p> <p>In my local curry house I was greeted like a long-lost friend. A huddle of young waiters gesticulated excitedly towards me. Eventually I realised they were pointing at my bag, picked up during a recent trip to China, and emblazoned with the Chinese script for Shanghai. \"You've been to China,\" they said, \"China have just put a man in space - they're taking over from America.\"</p> <p>These young Bengalis are not just motivated by regional passions. Everywhere in the developing world people are sitting up and taking notice of the Chinese juggernaut. As a model for development it is a source of inspiration, its giddy growth rates of over 8% a year lifting millions of people out of poverty. </p> <p>But even more exciting is the prospect of a new superpower that might challenge US hegemony and the American way of doing things. In a paper for the Foreign Policy Centre, Joshua Ramo, a former foreign editor at Time who is based in China, laid out the elements of a new \"Beijing consensus\", which he sees as a direct challenge to the \"Washington consensus\" that defined attitudes towards the development debate in the 1990s. Beijing is \"driven not by a desire to make bankers happy, but by the more fundamental urge for equitable, high-quality growth\", he wrote. </p> <p>China treats the ideas of privatisation and free trade with caution rather than pursuing them with zeal; the country is defined by its ruthless willingness to innovate and experiment and has created a series of \"special economic zones\" to test out new ideas. Its foreign policy is driven by a lively defence of national borders and interests (see its attitude towards Taiwan) and an increasing commitment to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, which it hopes will pin the US down. Together these policies have allowed China to grow without surrendering its independence to such financial institutions as the World Bank and IMF, global companies, or the Bush administration. </p> <p>This recipe for success is so intoxicating that, on visits to countries as diverse as Iran and South Africa, I have been drawn into discussions about the \"Chinese model of development\". China's model is seducing leaders in countries as different as Vietnam (which is taking business tips from the thoughts of the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin), Brazil (which is sending study teams to Beijing), and India (Ramgopal Agarwala, an eminent sociologist, observed: \"China's experiment should be the most admired in human history. China has its own path.\").</p> <p>Few in the west have picked up on this excitement, because they have looked at China's power simply by measuring the size of its economy or the technology of its army. But by focusing on Chinese hard power (its ability to use military force or economic might to get its way) people are missing the extraordinary rise of the country's \"soft power\" - the ability of its ideas and values to shape the world. It is an unwritten rule in the minds of the west that though China might become wealthy, it is western values and culture that will continue to define the rules of the world. </p> <p>That is already changing. For the first time there is an emerging pole that is strong enough to change the way things are done on the global stage. Japan was too small and inward-looking; India is too protectionist; Russia too weak. As China emerges as a superpower, it is desperately trying to present itself as a force for good in the world. The past few years have seen a successful Olympic bid, the creation of an English language international TV channel, a series of high-level visits by President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to key countries, and a concerted attempt to befriend not just China's neighbours but other countries as far afield as Africa and Latin America. Two centuries ago Napoleon warned China was a \"sleeping giant\" that \"once awake would astonish the world\". That prediction looks like it is about to be fulfilled.</p> <p><b>Rise of the east</b></p> <p>The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, laid down a marker for the world in April when he outlined China's ambitions in a speech to the Boao Forum for Asia. \"We will quadruple the 2,000 GDP to $4 trillion with a per capita GDP of $3,000, and further develop the economy, improve democracy, advance science and education, enrich culture, foster greater social harmony and upgrade the texture of life for the people,\" he said. </p> <p>Some in America responded positively to the remarks - former president George Bush Sr said China's peaceful rise was \"very reassuring and very, very important to the Asian horizon and Asia's landscape\" - but there are many in America who are disquieted by China's rise. Its military expenditure is rising, though it will still not compete with US defence spending and it has become increasingly bullish over Taiwan. In July, Jiang Zemin - the former president who heads China's armed forces - said China would have recovered the island by 2020. </p> <p>His remarks coincided with military exercises involving 18,000 troops, designed to demonstrate China's air superiority in the Taiwan Strait. It is also seeking to compete in space: Luan Enjie, the head of the national space programme, said last November that China intends to land a man on the moon by 2020.</p> <p>One motor of China's growth is its increasing population but with such rapid expansion come problems. Some relate to China's programme of population planning. The one-child policy has created a shortage of female babies, and the government has admitted that by 2020 China might have as many as 40 million single men, which could pose a threat to social stability.</p>",
  "<p>\"Good morning. Here is the shipping forecast for midday, June 21 2020. Seas will be calm, and visibility will range from good to excellent for the next 24 hours. The sea lanes from Bergen to Tokyo via the north-east passage will largely be free of ice, but occasional small floes may drift near the Siberian coast. The north-west passage from Europe to Fairbanks, Alaska, and Vancouver will also be clear, although iceberg hazards cannot be ruled out between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. The Bering Strait was, for the fourth time in the past decade, free of ice for the entire winter and will remain open for the rest of the summer.\"</p> <p>That's just the Arctic. By the summer of 2020, global warming will have had such devastating effect on the northern icecap that European ships may routinely cross the high latitudes to take the short routes to Asia and the Pacific. The Arctic Ocean, once frozen solid all winter and choked with hazardous floes for most of the summer, could be one of the friendlier seas. The perilous shortcuts that defied the heroic attempts of the Englishman Martin Frobisher and the Dutchman Willem Barents more than 400 years ago may soon become not just plain sailing, but the standard summer sea route from Europe to the Pacific.</p> <p>Cruise tourists and shipping magnates might wish to thank global warming. But the chances are they will not. That is because one of the Arctic's great spectacles, the polar bear, will have taken a dive: they need the sea ice to survive. For them, the ice is the way to a diet of seals, walruses and small whales. When the floes go, ursus maritimus will be on the road to extinction.</p> <p>The polar bear's base of operations has been shrinking inexorably as the planet warms. Over the past 40 years, the sheath of ice that covered the Arctic Ocean has thinned by 40%. The area covered by ice has also shrunk by more than 25%. Although much climate science is necessarily based on indirect evidence, the state of the Arctic Ocean has been monitored directly by people whose lives depend on the accuracy of their measurements. US, Russian and British nuclear submarines began charting the thickness of Arctic ice at the height of the cold war, and satellite cameras have been recording seasonal changes in ice cover for more than three decades. The conclusions are beyond dispute and the process is unstoppable. By 2020, according to the US Office of Naval Research, the north-east and north-west passages should be navigable. By 2050, according to the UK Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction, the Arctic Ocean could be free of ice in summer. </p> <p>That will happen because although the planet as a whole is warming perceptibly, the Arctic is warming eight times faster - largely because of a phenomenon called the albedo effect.</p> <p>Put simply, white reflects light, but dark absorbs it. So the sunlight crashing on to the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, the Alpine and tropical glaciers, and the snows of the great mountain chains bounces back into space. In effect, ice is its own insulator: glaciers tend to keep themselves glacial even in the summer. </p> <p>But once ice starts to melt, dark ocean or rock is exposed. That absorbs the heat, and begins to accelerate the melting process. As long as the average temperatures stay low, there is a natural brake: in high summer, snow evaporates but falls again in winter, to replace the melting ice and to keep conditions more or less stable. The problem is that things have begun to change. Glaciers in Alaska and the mountains of tropical Africa are in retreat, and climate scientists have predicted that by 2020 the snows of Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya will have vanished. </p> <p>In Europe, Alpine economies built on skiing and other mountain sports will have begun to fail. In south Asia, for at least part of the year, snow melt is the only source of water for millions of farmers. </p> <p>Adventure tourists will lose their holidays. Others stand to lose rather more. On the Indian subcontinent, half a billion people depend on the Indus and Ganges rivers, whose sources lie among melting snows of the the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram and the western Himalaya. But these great snowfields, too, are disappearing. </p> <p>All this is on the basis of an annual global average temperature rise of 0.1C a decade up to now. But it wouldn't take much to make things change faster, and those changes would be irreversible. If global average temperatures rise by more than 2.7C, according to calculations published in Nature in April, then the great sheet of ice that covers Greenland will start to melt faster than it can be replaced. The Geological Survey of Greenland and Denmark warned this summer that the ice sheet, which covers 772,000 square miles and is up to two miles thick, is melting 10 times quicker than previously thought. The sheet is thinning at 10 metres per year, not one metre. It could take 1,000 years for the sheet to completely disappear, but as it does so, sea levels will begin to rise by about 7mm a year. Once all the ice has gone, the world's oceans will have risen by around seven metres. </p> <p>This will happen, because global temperatures seem likely to rise by far more than 2.7C. Ten years ago, the UN's Intercontinental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set up to study global warming proposed a maximum temperature rise of about 3C by 2100. Three years ago, IPCC revised that prediction. The maximum temperature rise during the present century is set at almost 6C. And the predicted maximum temperature rise for Greenland is put at up to 8C. </p> <p>That is not the only danger posed by the thawing of the world's cold places. The Arctic regions are rimmed by permafrost: regions of tundra that enjoy an urgent spring, a brief, brilliant summer and then a long, hostile winter. These landscapes hold stores of ancient carbon and methane in the form of decaying vegetation imprisoned for 10,000 years or more. Once the permafrost starts to melt, awesome quantities of carbon dioxide and methane - two potent greenhouse gases - will be released from thawing peat bogs to accelerate the warming process yet further. This climate phenomenon is known as \"positive feedback\". </p> <p>By 2020, then, the Arctic will have begun to change for ever. The adventure tales of the past will be distant history: stories of explorers fighting their way by sled across the perilous frozen seas will be science fiction to young readers and nostalgic yearnings for a lost world to their parents. </p> <p>\"Here is the long-term weather forecast for the tropical and temperate zones at midday, June 21 2020. After a series of increasingly wet winters, northern Europe could once again be at risk of a lethal heat wave. Forest fires are raging in the Iberian Peninsula, southern France and the Balkans. Water rationing has once again been imposed in California. Relief agencies have warned that late rains raise the spectre of widespread hunger in the Sahel and southern Africa. Bangladesh, however, is once more preparing for catastrophic floods.\"</p> <p>It's a matter of simple physics: a warmer world means a rising sea level. Warm water is less dense than cold, so some of the sea level rise will happen just because the water already in the oceans has begun to expand. But sea levels have begun to rise still further with the melting of continental ice and the retreat of the glaciers. The effects of the rise will only slowly become apparent - even the most pessimistic predictions suggest that by 2100 the sea level will only be a metre higher - but even at that slow rate many millions of people will be imperilled. Sea level rise is a threat to anybody who lives at or a fraction above sea level, and especially to citizens of those countries classed as developing. That, of course, means poor. </p> <p>For such people, the future looks very bleak. There are 54 members of the Commonwealth. Only six of these are classed as developed nations. Around 93% of the Commonwealth lives in the other 48. Some of these countries may have no future at all. \"If the scientific forecasts prove correct, then by the end of the century membership of the Commonwealth will have declined because two or three nations will have disappeared,\" warned Clive Hamilton, director of the Australian Institute, in September 2003. Two Commonwealth states - the Maldives and Tuvalu - are at risk of complete submersion by 2080. Two other groups of islands - Kiribati and the Bahamas - will be in a bad way, because almost all their territories lie below the four-metre mark. </p> <p>Each of those states will already be facing periodic devastation and permanent crisis by 2020. The bedrock of many of the islands is coral limestone. Coral is a living thing, so if sea levels were to rise slowly enough - over 1,000 rather than 100 years - then coral could grow to keep up with the water levels. But coral is extremely sensitive to rising temperatures: the corals that make up most reefs and atolls are already at the limits of their temperature tolerance. Those reefs near human settlements are choked by man-made pollutants, and their ecologies have been permanently altered by intensive fishing. </p> <p>Any increase in ocean temperatures means death by bleaching - the corals turn white and die. This has happened a number of times in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Great Barrier Reef near Australia, with cyclical rises in water temperatures. Those rises have been followed by cyclical falls, so the corals have had the chance to recover. But global warming means permanent heating, and the living corals that support life - both human and non-human - in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are expected to perish on a massive scale. </p> <p>The coral won't be the only thing to suffer. The oceans will seep into the bedrock, polluting the subterranean fresh water. Agriculture will become impossible, supplies of drinking water will be minimal and as the waters rise the islands will start to drown in seawater.</p> <p>Island dwellers, of course, will not be the only ones at risk. Hundreds of millions of people in densely populated countries with low-lying coastal plains or vast estuaries will come under threat from rising sea levels. According to Sir John Houghton, a former director of the UK Met Office and author of Global Warming: The Complete Briefing, a sea level rise of half a metre could sweep away or make uninhabitable about 10% of the habitable land of Bangladesh. That land is currently home to at least six million people. Sea levels will not need to rise by half a metre worldwide to make this happen: the delta region of Bangladesh is subsiding, partly because groundwater is being abstracted for agriculture to feed the nation's 140 million citizens. </p> <p>By 2050, waters could have risen by a metre, claiming 20% of Bangladesh and displacing 15 million people. By 2100, the ocean may have encroached up the rivers almost as far as Dhaka, one of the world's fastest growing cities, and across the Indian border to the edge of Calcutta. </p> <p>A glance around the world shows the same pattern being repeated again and again. In Egypt, a metre rise in the Mediterranean will mean the fertile lands of the Nile delta will disappear beneath the sea, claiming 12% of the country's arable land and displacing seven million people. A sea level rise of half a metre would also cause havoc in the Netherlands and in the Mississippi delta. But the difference between those two regions and those in the developing world is that the Dutch and the Americans already spend money on sea defences and can afford more. In China, a half-metre rise in the sea level could inundate the alluvial plains of the eastern coast, covering an area of land the size of the Netherlands, leaving 30 million homeless. </p> <p>And if the sea doesn't get you, the storms will. Hurricanes and cyclones are freak events whose existence is controlled by sea temperatures. If the surface temperature of the ocean is below 26.5C, typhoons, tropical cyclones and hurricanes hardly happen. But with each rise of the mercury beyond that point they become more frequent and more ferocious. Savage storms, and the sea surges they bring, will pose huge threats to small island states and could scour low-lying land completely clear. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, climate scientists warned that in a greenhouse world, the kind of fierce storms that had been once-a-century occurrences would come around every decade. The fatal combination of very high tide and tropical cyclone has hit Bangladesh and the Bengal coast of India many times. In 1991, one such storm surge claimed an estimated 139,000 lives. In 1970, another killed 300,000 people. UN researchers warned in June that an estimated one billion people live in the path of the kind of flood that used to occur every 100 years: by 2050, the number of potential victims could reach two billion.</p> <p>If two billion people are at risk of dramatic inundation in 2020, around 2.3 billion others living in the world's water-poor nations could face an even more wretched future. They will see increasingly parched landscapes, empty wells, polluted lakes and rivers that run dry. UN experts calculated that in 2000, people in 30 nations faced water shortages. By 2020, they predict, that number will have risen to 50 nations. </p> <p>As temperatures rise, more water will evaporate, but rainfall will remain capricious. Countries in the monsoon belt will face more severe droughts in the dry season but could also have to deal with more catastrophic flooding. Other regions - the southern Mediterranean, north Africa, southern Africa and the Sahel - could become even more arid, with olive groves succumbing to desertification. The great plains of North America, the breadbasket for the planet, could turn again into a dustbowl, delivering less and less grain to a world that acquires an extra 240,000 mouths to feed every single day. </p> <p>The pattern of falling crop yields will be seen all over the planet. They are expected to decline by at least 10% in most African Commonwealth countries, and by even more in Mozambique, Tanzania, Botswana and Namibia. There could also be dramatic falls in food production in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, although harvests could increase by 10% in Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Papua New Guinea. Canada and New Zealand could also see dramatic increases in crop yields but Australia, already largely arid, will be one of the economic losers. </p> <p>And forget the glib remarks about the one good side-effect of global warming being decent summers. In 2003, more than 20,000 people died in northern Europe because of a heat wave that saw Germany roasting in its hottest temperatures for 450 years. Climate scientists believe that if atmospheric warming continues unchecked, such heat waves can be expected every 20 years or so - so expect summer 2020 to be every bit as oppressive as last year. </p> <p>\"The summer of 2003 was a summer of the future,\" said Gerhard Berz, head of natural risks research at Munich Re, one of the insurance giants that has to calculate hazard and pick up the bill for floods, heat waves, ice storms, hurricanes, forest fires and droughts. </p> <p>Global warming is expected to bring good news for some. But right now it looks like it will be delivering bad news to most people by 2020. The IPCC, the international consortium of climate scientists that has delivered increasingly urgent warnings since it was established in 1988, is that rare thing: a group of scientists who would love to be proved wrong. Their predictions have been made in the hope that governments will take action, and in doing so direct the planet towards a less fearful future. There is evidence that governments have been listening. </p> <p>Action, however, has been slow. Acting now would be too late to avert the challenges of 2020. We are starting to see the effects of carbon emissions of a few decades ago: your fuel-efficient small car is an investment in the future, because we're currently paying for that great gas guzzler your family was driving in the 70s. Every cook who knows a bit about science understands a concept called thermal inertia: the gas is on full, but the kettle takes a few minutes to boil, and though the gas is off, it takes a while to cool down. We're still waiting for the earth to start simmering, but by 2020 the bubbles will be appearing, whatever we do today. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tim Radford is the Guardian's science editor</p> <p><strong>Can we predict the weather?</strong></p> <p>As Sam Goldwyn said, prediction is always difficult, especially of the future. There are huge uncertainties in climate forecasting. The planet is a complicated place: its climate is influenced by the interplay of sunlight, atmosphere, dust, ocean currents and rainfall; by the temperature gradient between the tropics and the poles; by the topography of continents; by the balance of forests, wetlands, deserts, savannahs and oceans, as well as by the chemistry and biochemistry of the seas. </p> <p>To grasp the patterns of the future, climate scientists have to know the pattern of climate change in the past. That means they have to examine the indirect evidence provided by ice cores, tree rings, coral growths, and mud samples from oceans and lakes in order to estimate greenhouse gas levels and average temperatures in the distant past. Then they must monitor the oceans, the upper and lower atmosphere, and weather patterns around the whole planet to understand the mechanics of climate now. Only then can they start composing computer models of what might happen the day after tomorrow. So when politicians - and, sometimes, other scientists - make accusations of uncertainty, speculation and possible error, they have a point. There is no doubt the planet is warming, but how much of that is caused by some natural cycle nobody yet understands? And how much is the result of human interference? And what will humans do in the future that might make conditions better or worse? </p> <p>Atmospheric chemists say they understand the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, quite well. But methane, though shorter-lived, is an even more potent greenhouse gas: what role could it play in the future? Water vapour, too, is a greenhouse gas: a warmer world means more water vapour in the atmosphere. Will it make the world an even hotter place? Or will it mean greater cloud cover, which might then act as a brake on global warming by cutting out more sunlight? Those questions are unanswered and the debate goes on. </p> <p>Through 15 years of intensive climate study, however, the broad message from the scientists has remained much the same. They are now convinced that indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels is steadily increasing the global average atmospheric temperature. And the only way to halt or at least slow global warming would be to make dramatic cuts in carbon emissions. Which leads to the other great unanswered question: can we meet that challenge? <strong>TR</strong></p> <p><strong>Earth blows hot and cold</strong></p> <p>Earth's climate has always been subject to ups and downs, and there is nothing novel about a warm Arctic. Ninety million years ago, during the Cretaceous era, deciduous forests stretched into the Arctic circle, and carnivorous dinosaurs roamed Antarctica. Five years ago, palaeontologists uncovered the bones of an eight-foot champosaur, a reptile with a crocodile-like snout and razor-sharp teeth, under the Alaskan snows. Such a creature could only have survived in a warmer world, and experts calculate that the average annual temperature in Alaska must have been 14C. That is, it may never have frozen, even in the coldest winters. </p> <p>The globe can blow both hot and cold: much earlier, glaciers reached almost to the equator. Some climate scientists have hypothesised a \"snowball Earth\" - a completely frozen world - for at least four spells between 750m years ago and 580m years ago, before things warmed up again. </p> <p>Human civilisation is generally adapted to a cooler world. Around 21,000 years ago, during the height of the last ice age, sea levels were 135 metres lower than they are today, and the continents were covered by an extra 52 million cubic kilometres of ice. The interglacial thaw that took place 11,000 years ago gave agriculture, metalwork and urban civilisation its kickstart. </p> <p>For a while back in the 1970s some climate scientists wondered about the possibility of an imminent return of the ice age. And earlier this year, European scientists drilling in the Antarctic settled an answer to that question. The evidence from the ice cores suggests that, even if carbon dioxide levels were normal, there could still be another 15,000 years before the glaciers return to southern England. </p> <p>But carbon dioxide levels are not normal. They're rising and they're rising fast. The evidence from the same ice cores confirms that both temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are now higher than at any time in the last 400,000 years. The evidence from fossil plankton drilled from the seabed tells an even more ominous story: carbon dioxide levels are higher than at any time in the last 20m years. And they are expected to double in the coming century. That means higher temperatures, for longer - and it means that any existing forecasts of a new ice age are likely to be way off course. <strong>TR</strong></p>",
  "<b>Central Africa</b> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>Over recent decades, central Africa has seen a series of bitter and bloody civil wars and a genocide, with millions dying or uprooted. Because the roots of these conflicts spill over national boundaries, the security of the central African nations is interlinked; any dramatic deterioration in this interlinked security during the next 20 years could mean the virtual collapse of central governments in the region. If that happens by 2020, anarchy could have spread through the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda and Congo. </p> <p>The neighbouring countries will then also face deepening insecurity as refugees pour over their borders. Expect more of the same chilling stories we have seen in recent years: reports of mass rape, kidnapping, and forced recruitment drives taking men and boys off the land and into armed rebel factions.</p> <p>The DRC would be the centre of this regional political and security vacuum, but intervention would be impossible. Given the level of lawlessness, forces under the mandate of the UN, the EU or the African Union would become targets of ambushes or kidnappings by increasingly reckless and confident armed groups. As a result central Africa could become, as parts of eastern DRC and Sudan are now, a no-go area for outsiders, making it impossible to deliver the humanitarian aid that would be desperately needed.</p> <p>A circular process of dedevelopment could engulf the whole region. If war becomes a permanent state, it will destroy hopes of improved health and education, and reverse the gains of the post-colonial years of the late 20th century. If millions are unable to access any sort of modern healthcare, rampant malaria will run unchecked and could kill tens of thousands, especially babies and small children. Dengue fever and sleeping sickness would attack all sectors of the population, while the failure of inoculation programmes for children would mean epidemics of measles and the probable re-emergence of diseases such as polio. The constant war would also have the side effect of causing HIV/Aids to spread faster than ever: it would be transmitted through the migration of impoverished people forced into refugee status and through the use of rape as a weapon of war (this would be a militarised culture in which powerless women are despised and men live outside any traditional community except their shifting armed groups). The most productive section of society would be hardest hit by deaths from Aids, which in turn would tighten the cycle of poverty. With health disasters piling on the population one after another, life expectancy could drop as low as 30 to 35, and households headed by children or old men and women would be the norm. Those kind of family groupings do not have the strength to cultivate land, and they will be forced into the most marginal subsistence agriculture, or, in some places in DRC, dangerous artisan mining of diamonds, gold and coltan. Girls would be compelled to join the sex trade to survive in the corrupt, swollen mega cities. </p> <p>After years of warfare, a generation of uneducated youth would know only the brutalised life of the gun, meaning that the gulf between the political elite of the countries and the rest of the population would be wider than ever. The possibility of moving any part of the region towards democracy might disappear for generations. The civilian brain drain would worsen, depriving the civic culture and leaving the military in the ascendant. That would set the stage for new dictatorial regimes as debased as those of Idi Amin in Uganda, or Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire. Africa's standing in the rest of the world would be completely debased, and African writers and artists would no longer be portraying life in the continent, only life in exile. </p> <p>Would the US seek to make its presence felt to help guarantee security? Yes, but only out of self-interest. With regional war on the horizon, the US would quickly upgrade its warm relations with Uganda and establish a permanent military base for the region, in order to maintain access to the oil reserves of southern Sudan. Like other western governments, however, it will have given up on the people of the region.</p> <p> <b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>In 2020 central Africa could be a completely different place, where the warlords and kleptocrats of the present day would be nothing but historical curiosities, and where new visionary leadership, much of it female, could lead the continent in transformed relations with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Under this leadership, arms sales to Africa would be banned by the newly invigorated African Union, and the war zones of central Africa would begin to hold regular competitions for the biggest and longest burning bonfires of small arms. The spark for this would be a major western political figure - perhaps Gordon Brown - taking the initiative in the very near future and persuading the G8 to cancel Africa's debt and remove all agricultural subsidies in Europe and the US, providing equal access to EU and US markets. The 2004 annual global figure of $300bn in subsidies to farmers in the rich nations would be abolished. And if the European leaders would make the leap to fight terrorism by first fighting poverty and injustice, that money could be put into the weakest states in the world - many of them in central Africa.</p> <p>Massive funding for health and education would then pour into the continent, especially into central Africa's former war zones. New HIV/Aids vaccines could prevent a disastrous shift in the demographics of Africa and successfully arrest the decline of the productive age group, ensuring the the region would not lose their farmers, teachers and nurses.</p> <p>Education funding on an unprecedented scale would be a priority. By 2020 it might at last be recognised that UN and aid agency piecemeal projects to eliminate illiteracy have failed postwar societies. What Africa's new generations really need is tertiary education if they are to create both civil societies and a political class able to make an impact in the wider world. That could be achieved with a mass of new initiatives planned in the region and funded from outside. Devices such as twinning African universities with western universities and increased use of distance learning for African students could be the fashionable causes for western academic institutions. The judicious use of targeted funding could also address the long-standing problem of the brain drain. The combination of political stability and money could lure back those who have left and keep those who had planned to leave. If that can be achieved, by 2020 central Africa would have leaders capable of transforming the region. With secure, democratic governments free of corruption, the rule of law could become a priority. Warlords would be delivered to the International Criminal Court to stand trial for their war crimes. At home there would be trials for corruption, truth commissions would be established, and governments would be able to compensate survivors.</p> <p>If Africa, aided by resources from the rich countries, can manage two decades of building skills, free and open communication, and pluralist politics, we can hope by 2020 for the growth of a confident political class unlike any since the first years of independence from colonialism, when Congo's Patrice Lumumba was the region's hero. The impact of these leaders on international bodies such as the UN, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF could help produce by 2020 the new world order so elusive over the previous half century.</p> <p> <b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>By 2020 central Africa will be divided into two types of country. In failing states, such as DRC, large areas of the country will be out of contact and control of the weak central authority. But two decades of strong and visionary leaders in states such as Rwanda and Tanzania will lead to huge investment in education and technology in those countries, which will have emerged as regional leaders. They'll also be recognised across as the first countries to transcend ethnic politics, which will be widely considered old-fashioned and destructive.</p> <p>In these flourishing countries the population will be moving out of poverty. New computer-based industries will provide work for the educated, as has already happened in Bangalore and Chennai. Ecotourism will be a magnet for high-spending foreigners and bring infrastructure and income to rural areas. The brain drain to the west will be a forgotten phenomenon, and the universities will be linked to the best specialised departments across the world.</p> <p>The west will have long since cancelled Africa's debt, and vastly increased aid will flow to the continent. And the agricultural subsidies to western farmers that used to be thought an essential part of European and American domestic politics will seem a curious piece of old history. But in places where the leadership is weak and lacks vision, the new external resources will not have been enough to break the cycle of poverty.</p> <p>Violence will still hold sway, and poor education and poor health - especially the scourge of HIV/Aids - will still cripple the population. In these countries, life expectancy will be the lowest in the world. Ethnic loyalties will still be the determining factor in politics, and a ready supply of small arms into the region means armed factions will still control many areas in shifting alliances with each other, leaving the populations as desperately insecure and poor as they are now. The rich natural resources of those countries will not enable them to escape this bleak future. Outsiders will control the rich mining areas of DRC and the oil wealth of southern Sudan, and the profits will flow out of Africa as they have for centuries.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Victoria Brittain has worked on Africa since 1975 and lived in several African countries, some as the Guardian's correspondent</p> <p><b>Middle East</b></p> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>The US will blame Iranian interference for the turmoil in Iraq and will launch military strikes against the Tehran regime. Resistance to the US will stiffen in Iran and among Shia Muslims across the region: Shia rebellions could break out in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Anarchy in Iraq will give Kurds the excuse they need to declare independence and foment a Kurdish uprising in Syria.</p> <p>The \"war on terror\" will destroy al-Qaida as an organisation but it will not dampen Islamist militancy. Its greatest effect will be to spawn hundreds of small autonomous groups that prove impossible to monitor. </p> <p>The Yemeni elections of 2009 will prove to be the last in the Arab world as governments backtrack on democracy, blaming the deteriorating security situation. The EU will deal with that same problem by approving a Middle East stability pact that lifts all restrictions on weapon sales to regimes that are deemed to be combating terrorism.</p> <p>The threat of Islamist terror will continue to spread beyond the Arab world. London will face its gravest threat when an Islamist group threatens to explode a dirty nuclear device unless Britain stops supporting \"Arab lackeys of Zionism and Crusaderism\". There will be no progress towards peace with Israel, so the Palestinians will abandon their claim for a separate state and demand equal rights with Israeli citizens. </p> <p>By 2015, the UN will have accepted a plan to divide the whole of historic Palestine into a series of Jewish and Arab cantons, but it will not end the conflict. By 2020, Nato forces sent to implement the plan will still be struggling to impose peace in the face of stiff resistance from extremists on both sides.</p> <p><b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>The Arab-Israeli conflict will end by 2008 with the creation of a viable Palestinian state, and a peace treaty between Israel and Syria. All the Arab states, plus Iran, will then recognise Israel and exchange ambassadors. Talks can begin on ridding the Middle East of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and by 2012 UN inspectors will be able to declare the region a WMD-free zone.</p> <p>Peace with Israel would remove one of the main driving forces behind Islamic militancy in the region, which would in turn lead to a decline in terrorism. Political reform throughout the region would also follow peace, since Arab leaders would no longer be able to blame Israel for their countries' problems.</p> <p>Iraq will avert civil war and stay in one piece - but only just. Amid the chaos left by its elected civilian government, the return to military rule later this decade will be greeted with widespread relief. By 2020, the Iraqi regime will still be promising elections \"next year or as soon as the situation permits\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, the strategy of gradual but steady reform is largely successful. By 2020, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states will have become constitutional monarchies, while Yemen, Egypt and Syria will have all held elections that - for the first time - result in changes of government. In Africa, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia will be readying themselves to join the EU, probably by 2030. Libya, which could be the Mediterranean's fastest-growing tourist destination by 2020, will remain politically eccentric: all government decisions will be made by citizens voting on the net.</p> <p><b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>How will Iraq be faring in 2020? It will be a toss-up between rule by Saddam Lite (authoritarianism with American blessing) and the fragmentation of the state. The underlying conflicts over religion and ethnicity will take years to play out - probably through violence, unless a strong national leader emerges. Continued instability in Iraq will harm all its neighbours.</p> <p>But that does not mean the region will have been dragged into continual conflict. By 2020 there will be a new generation of Arabs who have known satellite TV and the internet all their lives; the significance of that should not be underestimated. So far, globalised media has achieved three things in the Middle East: it has engaged ordinary Arabs in international politics in a way that was impossible before; it has given them a view of western lifestyles that some covet and others reject; and it has given them a sense of common Muslim/Arab identity that cuts across borders and the nationalism of individual states.</p> <p>The belief that Arabs and Muslims are victims of American and Israeli designs is almost universal in the Middle East, as is the feeling that the current leaders are powerless to do anything about it. One response - the dominant one at present - is Islamist militancy, but there are others, especially among the urban young, who want to be like the rest of the world. Among religious believers, too, there are many who privately question the confrontational, backward-looking interpretations of Islamists.</p> <p>There is a chance that, by 2020, the fundamentalist trend will have peaked and that new, more progressive interpretations of Islam will have begun to emerge. The idea that Arab/Muslim societies can survive as islands of cultural authenticity or religious purity in a globalised world is nothing but pure fantasy. Today, Saudi censors go through every imported newspaper, obliterating \"undesirable\" material while millions of Saudi citizens are able to watch whatever takes their fancy on satellite television. </p> <p>Moves towards a form of Islam that is more compatible with modern life will also be reflected in social and political changes. The need here is not for cosmetic democracy but for ideas of tolerance and openness to take hold, for accountability and transparency in public life, and for political parties based on policies rather than tribal, ethnic or religious allegiances.</p> <p>It's a tall order, but it will have to happen sometime. The two factors most likely to hold it back are American policies towards the region and continued conflict with Israel. It is difficult to imagine that Israeli voters, at some point before 2020, will not weary of the strategy pursued by their present government and decide that there has to be a better way. </p> <p>Whether American voters will reach the same conclusion is more doubtful. The old, confrontational cold war themes play well with American voters when reapplied to the Arab and Muslim world, but don't really serve American interests. The best thing the US can do for the Middle East over the next 16 years is stop prescribing solutions and ask: \"Is there anything we can do to help?\" It should also not be too offended when the reply is \"Yes. Please go away.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Brian Whitaker is the Guardian's Middle East editor</p> <p><b>Kashmir</b></p> <p><b>What's the worst that could happen?</b></p> <p>India and Pakistan's rivalry over Kashmir could, by 2020, have finally have erupted into a nuclear exchange that might leave 100 million people dead and lay waste to half a million square kilometres of rich agricultural land in Asia. The roots of such a disaster would lie in a series of political miscalculations and in chronic economic mismanagement.</p> <p>The main problem will be the two neighbours refusing to make the tough decisions required for peace. Political misjudgments would see India failing to realise its potential as an economic powerhouse, with successive governments introducing policies that favour the rise of a small urban elite, rather than lifting the fortunes of the rural poor. This could spark armed insurrection among the poor of northern and eastern India. The Maoist rebellion in Nepal would exacerbate the problem, providing ideological coherence from the Himalaya to the plains of India.</p> <p>Governance will be a thing of the past in many of India's large northern and eastern states. The country's southern regions, which have their own distinctive culture and languages, will begin to agitate for a form of independence. The north will react differently to the political chaos, electing a hardline Hindu nationalist leadership that would stress national unity. Its plea would fail. The Indian union will unravel if a south Indian fiscal union is formed between Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andra Pradesh and Karnataka. These four wealthy states, with close ties to the hi-tech US defence industry and burgeoning software industries, might refuse to subsidise the central government and the north, leading to a major political crisis.</p> <p>In Pakistan, the modernisers will lose out to the religious zealots by 2010 after Nato ends all its operations in Afghanistan. The military, in effect, will become the armed wing of a theocracy - one armed with a nuclear bomb. This fundamentalist state would begin to neglect education and would do little to stem the rise of Islamic institutes, preferring instead to produce an army of willing volunteers for jihad in Kashmir and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Religion would not be a strong enough glue for the nation. The simmering tension between the states of Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab would begin to boil over. The argument will be that Punjab's plains soak up most of Pakistan's water and its industry consumes most of the country's coal, depriving other states. Militant groups would declare independence in Sindh and Balochistan and begin targeting Punjabi officials. Pakistan's civil war would have begun.</p> <p>In Kashmir, the issue of water is going to be crucial. The three rivers that feed Pakistan - the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - run through Indian Kashmir. With the water table of Pakistan decreasing and north-west India facing shortages, the two nations will abrogate their mutual water treaty by 2015. America might by then have decided that an independent Kashmir is the answer and arm insurgency groups via China. And by then Kashmir will have become a killing field, with Indian and Pakistani-backed fighters engaged in open warfare. This war in Kashmir, Pakistan's anarchy and political chaos in India will turn the region into a live bomb: all that would be needed is someone to light the fuse. Kashmir will be the excuse, not the reason. But by this point apocalypse will be inevitable; the world will have seen its first case of mutually assured destruction.</p> <p><b>What's the best that could happen?</b></p> <p>By 2020 no one will believe that almost 20 years before, Pakistan and India were poised in a nuclear stand-off over the then restive Kashmir, which will have become the tranquil tourist haven of Kashmir Autonomous Region.</p> <p>The turning point was the summer of 2002, which marked the end of history for the region. Not long after, the leaders of the two nations began to escape from the prison of the past. India and Pakistan made the commitment to develop friendly relations and leave the settlement of the Kashmir question to the diplomatic process which began this year. </p> <p>The factor that will lead to peace is the realisation of the leadership of both countries that neither can win militarily. That, and the emergence of a new South Asian Union (SAU) as a single economic area, which will grease the development of sound bilateral relations. Instead of Hindu nationalism and Islamic chauvinism, leaders in both countries would then opt for good governance and development.</p> <p>The simple fact is that to house, feed and provide jobs for ever-growing populations, both India and Pakistan need to start working together. By making social and economic policies the priority for government, rather than nurturing nationalism, both will lift tens of millions out of poverty. Trade will be the proving ground of the new relationship. If the energy-hungry metropolises of the subcontinent can be supplied by pipelines from Iran and Turkmenistan, then both countries will stand to benefit. Islamabad will gain wealth from transit fees while India will be able to buy cheap energy. The two countries will discover that trade is a game of mutual interests, where both will be able to seek and gain benefit. Delhi will allow Pakistani goods to travel by road to reach south-east Asia. In return Islamabad will open transit routes to central Asia for Indian wares.</p> <p>The cultural and religious antagonisms between India and Pakistan will then fade, reducing the need for perpetual war-footing. No longer will their people consider each other to be in the grip of obscurantist preachers and zealots. They will be too busy setting up factories, rediscovering lost relatives and friends on the other side of the border, as well as taking holidays in hill stations and balmy sunspots. The signing of a nuclear-arms reduction treaty between India and Pakistan will also reduce tensions, and China will play a key role, aware that nuclear war in its backyard will hamper its own peaceful rise.</p> <p>In Kashmir, under the guidance of an American peace envoy, a ceasefire will be in place by 2007. The Indian army will finally withdraw from the Kashmir Valley and Delhi can then address the human rights violations perpetrated since the insurgency began in 1989. Pakistan, too, will end its shadowy intelligence operations and close down militant camps in Kashmir. Home-grown armed separatists can then move towards the use of the ballot box, not the bullet.</p> <p>If a settlement is reached, the pace of change could be so fast that the problem will be not peace, but deciding what follows peace. Kashmir's complicated geography and the fact its territory is fractured along the fault lines of national identity and state allegiance mean there would be no easy answers. There are minorities who would fight for the status quo as viciously as they would for independence.</p> <p>To defuse these tensions will require a peace plan that first devolves power from Islamabad and Delhi to the state capitals of the two halves of Kashmir. Also elections in Pakistani and Indian Kashmir would allow representation from all political shades. The border would remain but crossing it would require no travel documents. By 2020, a single Kashmir political entity could be a reality, in one of the world's most tense and bitter rivalries.</p> <p><b>What's likely to happen?</b></p> <p>The concept of a separate Kashmiri identity is going to disappear over the next 16 years, as the independence movement is submerged by the crashing waves of Indian and Pakistani nationalism. Kashmir will be simply carved into two by both countries, with China being handed the mountainous portion its army has occupied for decades. India and Pakistan will accept the deal, and the people of Kashmir will pay the price. Lacking an inspirational leader, Kashmiris will be unable to tell the world of their plight.</p> <p>The likely sop to the Kashmiri people will be a form of travel documents which both India and Pakistan will pledge to upgrade, eventually, into passports. Talk of a cross-border Kashmiri parliament will come to nothing: all that is likely to happen is a regular meeting of Indian and Pakistani-appointed politicians. Such a Kashmir settlement would not be accepted by separatists on either side of the border, but they will be unable to mobilise resistance. A joint Indo-Pakistan covert military operation will pick off the militant leaders and simply repress all forms of dissent. </p> <p>The reason for the diminishing importance of Kashmir in both national psyches is that both countries simply have more to lose than to gain over the issue. Pakistan will in time come to realise its primary advantage over India lies in its geopolitical location, which gives it access to the huge and growing market across the border. It will be in both countries' interests to agree a nuclear no-first-use pact, probably sponsored by the Americans</p> <p>The two countries will also be brought closer by the movement towards a south Asian common market. When an agreement to establish a SAU is finally signed in 2015, the region's legal and economic institutions will be forced to improve their services and, to some extent, harmonise their activities. The SAU would have to grant Kashmir special status, but to tempt investors restrictions on land acquisitions will be lifted, leading to a buy up by big business. That will mean the arrival of a migrant workforce for Kashmir's new industrial sector. The distinctive character of the region will start to fade, just like Tibet since its annexation by China.</p> <p>A less confrontational relationship between India and Pakistan will mean that by 2020 the shadow of conflict will no longer hang over south Asia.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Randeep Ramesh is the Guardian's south Asia correspondent</p>",
  "What will happen when the gas runs out, when the deepest oil well of the Arabian peninsula finally runs dry, when the giant drills of the offshore platforms reach nothing but dry rock? Will we face a future of blackouts and electricity rationing, or will we find a way to avert the doomiest scenarios and continue living lives in which energy consumption is crucial to everything we do. <p>Think of the electricity you use in a day. You are woken by the clock radio buzzing into life, and you turn the bathroom light on as you climb into your power shower. After dressing you head downstairs, where you turn on another radio, put some bread into the toaster and turn on the kettle, getting the milk from your fridge to put in your tea. After breakfast you head to work, where the lights are burning - and on go the computer and desktop fan. </p> <p>Those are just the most obvious of personal uses and the day has barely even begun. How can we possibly sustain such a level of usage? In short: renewable energy sources. </p> <p>There is no longer any doubt that renewable energies will play a large part in the future of mankind. If politicians show sufficient will and intelligence, and invest in a raft of new technologies, then we should be able to maintain our electricity supply and, as a beneficial side-effect, avert the disaster of rapid global warming.</p> <p>But as with the debate about nuclear power in the 1980s, it will not be environmental arguments that win the day, but economics. </p> <p>Nuclear power lost out not because of the vexed question of radioactive waste but because the truth finally emerged that it was a very expensive way to keep the lights on.</p> <p>When oil and natural gas begin to run out - and, more importantly, when demand exceeds supply - their prices will escalate and the cost of using them to generate electricity will become prohibitive. Continuing to use coal or, worse, increasing the quantity we burn will be more and more unacceptable, because it will add to the excessive quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Those factors make both renewables and nuclear more and more competitive.</p> <p>The renewables revolution has begun already, because researchers are anticipating the moment when renewables become economic. Although there are a range of renewables already in use, the contribution to world energy production - hydropower aside - remains relatively minor, at less than 1%. But there is a large selection of new renewables under research and development.</p> <p>Hydropower is already one of the largest and most established forms of renewable energy, providing 19% of the world's electricity. Of the others, geothermal is a long established and growing energy resource, and wind power is already a mainstream technology. A variety of other smaller technologies are also already economic, the best of which involves using methane from landfill sites. Across the world a mixture of other fuels from specially grown trees, forest offcuts, pig slurry, straw and even chicken litter are generating power. And there are others that are, as yet, underexploited but with great potential: solar is growing fast, and tidal, ocean currents and wave power are also undergoing rapid development. Further ahead, though not before 2020, lots of other possibilities exist - the prospect of the hydrogen economy and completely clean energy production has led to much excited speculation.</p> <p>In Europe, money is being poured into wave and tidal power. Undersea turbines, working on much the same principle as wind turbines, are already in operation in the UK and Norway. Their potential is huge, particularly because all along the Atlantic coast with its large tides, and many inlets and islands, there are countless sites for exploiting the power of the sea. And unlike the winds, tides are completely predictable.</p> <p>Wave power has great potential in exactly the same areas, and although the technical difficulties already encountered in its development means it has been expensive, there are many companies confident they can make it work. </p> <p>There is a race among developed countries to become leaders in these new technologies because of their vast potential to create jobs and exports.</p> <p>Geothermal technology is increasing in regional importance, particularly in countries that do not have a wind, tidal or wave resource. This heat is as inexhaustible and renewable as solar energy and comes from hot rocks near the earth's surface. Water is pumped into the hot ground and used on its return to the surface to create electricity and for district heating. The main geothermal areas of this type are located in New Zealand, Japan, Indonesia, Philippines, the western coastal Americas, the central and eastern parts of the Mediterranean, Iceland, the Azores and eastern Africa.</p> <p>But while all that sounds very exciting, leading environmental groups and engineers to take on the challenges of developing energy technology, mainstream organisations such as the World Energy Council still see fossil fuels dominating the agenda in 2020. That is mainly because the worldwide demand for electricity is escalating so fast they cannot see renewables catching up with the demand. The council is first to admit it could be wrong. It all depends on how quickly the oil and gas begin to run out.</p> <p>And then there is the nuclear question. It is not only the renewable industry that sees opportunities in the coming energy crisis and in our fears about the devastating effects of global warming. The nuclear industry rightly claims it provides a reliable source of energy that does not produce the carbon dioxide that fossil fuels do. But nuclear power is still dogged by the old, familiar problems: it takes a long time to take a nuclear power station from the drawing board to production; nor has anyone yet come up with a satisfactory method of disposing of nuclear waste. Neither of those disadvantages are attached to the new renewables.</p> <p>Currently there are 444 nuclear reactors worldwide, producing 16% of the world's electricity. Some countries rely on nuclear power for most of their electricity. France is the top of the list, generating 75% of its electricity in nuclear power stations. But most of the countries that have a lot of reactors - particularly in North America and Europe, with Japan also on the list - have stopped building new ones or have curtailed their programmes. As a result the closure programme is exceeding the rate of new building.</p> <p>But that does not mean there will be no nuclear revival. The nuclear industry is looking to expand into the growing economies of Asia, particularly in China, South Korea and India. China has just ordered four new stations and may confirm another four before Christmas. There are said to be plans to build two a year but even that expansion would only account for a tiny part of the massive need for power in that vast and fast-growing economy. Even the fourfold increase in the rate of Chinese nuclear expansion which the industry hopes to see by 2020 would provide less than 20% of the country's power. Other solutions are needed.</p> <p>The nuclear industry's other hope for a big push is the United States, not only because it is the world's largest economy but also because it is the one most dependent on oil and gas, and the one that wastes most of both. The energy crisis, when it comes, is going to hit first, and worst, the US. It is from there that the political push to make the world change course may come.</p> <p>The current administration does not give the world many reasons to hope. President George Bush was the man who repudiated the Kyoto protocol, which was designed to reduce greenhouse gases. Kyoto was one of the drivers of the renewable revolution and the fact that it has stalled because of the objections of the US and indecision of Russia has slowed progress towards their greater use. </p> <p>Despite his links to the oil industry, Dick Cheney, the vice president, pushed hard at the start of Bush's four-year term for a revival of the nuclear dream. So far nothing has happened, partly because of continued public resistance in the US and partly because of the lack of private investment. But the main barrier still remains the large capital cost of building a new nuclear power station. If you forget the costs of the pollution caused by fossil fuels (which is what the US does in its energy planning) then new coal or gas stations are far cheaper.</p> <p>But part of America's charm is its diversity of view. In August, California announced a plan to subsidise solar power for one million homes by surcharging consumers about 15 pence a month. The state aims to rival Japan and Germany in being a world leader in solar power.</p> <p>This debate about whether nuclear power is a viable energy source for the future has also started to grip Europe. Despite the heat being generated in the debate, expansion does not seem a viable option, mainly because of public resistance. Instead, many of the countries of western Europe have invested heavily in wind power, particularly Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark and Germany. </p> <p>In the UK, where nuclear stations are closing on a regular basis as they reach the end of their lives, about 20% of electricity still comes from reactors. However, there would be serious obstacles to building a new station, as a minority demands. It is estimated it would be 2020 before a new station could be finished, even if planning began now. By that time wind power will be producing about 15% of the UK's power, replacing the lost nuclear production.</p> <p>The opponents of the nuclear option say the future lies in the new breed of renewables, the potential of which is only now being fully understood. Although there is still room for more hydropower, it is the new technologies that hold out most hope.</p> <p>The new generation of energy, then, is likely to lie with forces as old as the earth itself: the elemental powers of the wind, waves and sun. The very things that have shaped so much of our past will also, with the application of the human factor of technology, help shape our future.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Paul Brown is the Guardian's environment correspondent</p>",
  "The oil jitters we saw this summer are likely to become commonplace as this decade progresses. This year, oil prices became news when the price of a barrel approached the $50 barrier. The knock-on effects were huge. For motorists, the prospect of the price of a litre of petrol rising towards a pound edged closer. For the stock markets, however, rising oil prices spelled panic. <p>Energy prices affect the world economy more than any other single factor. A stable economic future depends on the oil supply always keeping pace with worldwide demand. But an increasing number of experts believe that stability will soon disappear. This is known as the tip-over point, the moment at which demand exceeds supply and prices begin to rocket. The result, apart from the possibility of a worldwide recession, will be to spur investment in alternative energies. But will they be sufficiently developed to take the strain? </p> <p>The problem is who to believe. Oil is still being discovered, but consumption is rising at around 3% a year and oil wells elsewhere are running dry. Oil production is well past its peak in the US, and is running out in the North Sea - just 30 years after it was first exploited. Most of the world's reserves remain in the Middle East. The amount Iraq and Saudi Arabia pump into the world economy over the next 10 years will make a decisive difference to whether the tip-over point is reached.</p> <p>Some experts believe it will be reached by 2007. Dr Colin Campbell, a founder of the Association of Peak Oil, says the number of new oil discoveries has been declining since 1964. Given the need for continually increasing production, he believes oil supplies won't be able to keep pace with demand within three years.</p> <p>Traditionally inclined experts, including the World Energy Council, expect discoveries to continue, and shortfalls to be made up by new extraction technologies that will allow oil to be taken from shale deposits. But these predictions rest on a lot of assumptions. </p> <p>What is clear is that everyone is guessing, even if everyone claims their guess is better informed than anyone else's. One point they all agree on is that the oil and gas will run out: the arguments are about when, and how soon demand will exceed supply. But for now, the world carries on as if oil was going to last for ever. Everyone must accept that the more oil we use, the quicker tip-over point will be reached. </p> <p>At the present rate that could be well before 2020, which will not be good news for the global economy.</p>",
  "The woman was beloved in her town, a landlocked hamlet where she'd lived for many years. Everyone knew her name there, everyone waved when she walked or pedalled by on the tandem bicycle she rode alone, wearing a fedora once owned, she insisted, by Peter Lorre. <p>All was good for her in this community, and the community considered her essential. One day, though, she decided it was time to move to a town with a foghorn. She had been born, many decades earlier, in a seaside village where ships would be warned when the fog was thick and the surf unruly. </p> <p>She heard this sound - a gentle warning, like the wail of a whale or the bleat of an elephant - while in school, while in bed, while eating ribs outside on the deck, with her father, who'd been a longshoreman.</p> <p>And now, 35 years removed from the village of her birth, she missed the sound, or believed that she missed the sound, and believed that moving back to a place featuring fog and horns and water and ships would shake her from the slump, the funk, the valley - whatever it was in which she currently found herself. The rest of this story is about the Bush administration. </p> <p>You will have heard, friends in England, that John Ashcroft, our attorney general, authorised the FBI to visit the homes of those planning to protest the recent Republican convention. The FBI arrived on the doorsteps of college students, of middle-aged hippies, of people with no criminal records whatsoever. In the US this made the news, but in a very quiet way, buried in the back pages of our periodicals. </p> <p>But good lord! This is truly, absolutely the last straw, wouldn't you say? This is the stuff of totalitarianism - the intimidation of dissenters. Bejeesus and holy fuck! If your own monkey boy Tony B doesn't stand up against this sort of thing - it being a clear violation of the human rights understood by our armlocked nations - doesn't that make him complicit? I guess it's far too late for him to care. The saddest thing about this, and also the most pragmatically advantageous, is that it very well might turn a few of our 4% undecided finally against GW. </p> <p>Not that Iraq moved them, nor Guantanamo, nor Abu Ghraib, nor the gutting of the environment and rollback of all science and light and intellectual curiosity. Maybe this will, and though it's a terrifying price to pay, it will, in the end, be worthwhile. As for the woman of the foghorns, she actually got hit by a bus before she could move away. It was so sad.</p>",
  "<p>Barely a week into the new school term, and the artwork is already beginning to pile up. A haphazardly woven wallhanging, a dinosaur made from cereal boxes, and some sort of collage spewing string, glitter and polystyrene offcuts are in a heap on the kitchen table, awaiting display. But several days have now passed and still they lie there. Soon suspicions will be aroused and questions asked. Balled-up gobs of ancient Blu-Tack will be proffered and the children will point out the acres of empty space on the kitchen walls just waiting to be cheered up with their creations. Why the delay? </p> <p>The brutal truth is that, since I had the kitchen refitted, my children's pictures just don't go with the decor. In the time it has taken to paint over the horrible wallpaper and garish pine with a medley of subtle off-whites from Farrow &amp; Ball, I have turned into the sort of uptight monster who is extremely reluctant to have her pristine walls violated by anything as upsettingly slapdash as a clown's face made from pasta shapes glued on to school-issue sugar paper. </p> <p>It is, I admit, an ugly state of affairs when a craving for minimalism overrides a parent's desire to show pride in their children's creativity, but still I am torn, and cannot quite bring myself to display that Plasticine lizard fashioned from a wince-making medley of Day-Glo orange, green and pink. </p> <p>While wrestling with my conscience, I have attempted to shift some of the blame on to the twisted workings of the key stage two curriculum. I am convinced most primary school teachers are driven by a sadistic streak that leads them deliberately to sabotage parents' decorating schemes by encouraging children to make free with neon fake fur, glitter that drops all over your neutral sisal flooring, and scrunched-up tissue paper in shades selected to contradict this season's colour palette. So unless my nine-year-old can dream up a firework night scene without resorting to hackneyed oranges and reds, or devise a piece of weaving that picks up at least one of the soft neutrals in my magnificent new curtains, then, frankly, his work doesn't stand a chance of making the final cut. </p> <p>But there is no kind way of saying this to a child, so I am continuing to ignore the burgeoning collection of art on the table, now disappearing under a drift of bills and junk mail, and stalling the children with talk of buying, in the very near future, a proper cork noticeboard that will show off their work to optimum effect. But as sure as old Pringles tubes will be made into wonky pencil pots, there will be no noticeboard. Not in the kitchen, at any rate. I know that its role is to function as the throbbing, chaotic heart of the house, but at the moment mine looks more like an exceptionally clinical hospital sluice room, and that's the way I would like it to stay. I am proud of my children and love their artistic expressiveness, but at the moment what I love more is being complimented, by adult visitors, on my new, spacious kitchen. </p> <p>This isn't to say there is no child art on show around the house; there is plenty. Some pieces are mounted in maple frames, others transposed on to Perspex, at considerable expense, courtesy of a fancy London design company. This way both parties are kept happy: the children think their work is being granted lavish treatment because of its skill of execution, when, in truth, anally retentive parental quality control insists that it be spruced up and formalised in order to be acceptable for general display. </p> <p>There are, of course, some forms of junior creativity that are waved through with no deliberation whatever. Collections of tasteful stones arranged in attractive circles on a coffee table? Spot on. Organically shaped pieces of driftwood placed artfully on mantelpieces? Just the thing. Keep it natural, keep it neutral, I want to tell the children, and there will be no more nasty standoffs about clashing primary colours and questionable choices of wool offcuts for those homemade pompoms. </p> <p> Am I such a wicked parent? The evidence against me seems to be mounting up. I have become convinced that, with children aged nine and 12, we are far enough away from the hellish pre-school days of potato prints to consider reclaiming an adult environment. So much so that a white carpet has been laid and pale covers put on the sofas. As a result, I have become the kind of harridan who instigates a strict no-shoes policy and emits pained screams every time a visiting snot-nosed toddler comes within 50 metres of the living room. </p> <p>Perhaps it's asking too much to expect sympathy, but a little understanding would be appreciated. As a self-confessed sufferer from child art stress syndrome, I am about to enter the worst possible season. If the thought of autumnal dried leaf-and-twig collages isn't bad enough, there is the run-up to Christmas to consider - all that glitter, general garishness and an endless succession of wintry scenes featuring cotton-wool balls. On the plus side, snow is at least white and, should I defrost a little, it may yet merit a square metre or so of prime kitchen wall space.</p>",
  "In 1982, I was down at an interfaith centre in the West Country. A friend, an Anglican priest, suggested we went to meet his bishop. Since this particular bishop lived in a proper palace, I was really up for the visit and spent a lot of time gawping at the moat, crenellated walls and power-portraits. <p>The bishop was charming but suggested, en passant, that the massacres at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps did not represent Judaism's finest hour. Being a small but bolshy Jew, I pointed out that the massacres had been perpetrated by Lebanese Christian militia and what did he have to say about that? He looked at me with genuine bemusement and said: \"Obviously they weren't Christians because Christians don't do things like that. So I suppose we say, 'the blighters'.\" </p> <p>I didn't think it was a terribly adequate response but it was only a couple of sentences in a long exchange about the common problems faced by Christianity and Judaism in Britain. </p> <p>Even in the 1980s, Matthew Arnold's 150-year-old Dover Beach poem about the tide of faith receding still deafened us all. We worried about the death of God, being honest to God, and religion evaporating into the secular air. Perhaps that's why it didn't seem to us to play a significant part in most of the troubles of the world - with Belfast and Jerusalem as only partial exceptions. I remember giving sermons about the derivation of the Hebrew word for war - milchamah - which is from the word lechem, bread. The Marxists, I said, had a point when they saw economics as the basis for all struggle. It's poverty, not religion, that is the problem \"out there\". But the real problem, here where it matters, is the receding tide of faith. </p> <p>With hindsight, I can see what a staggeringly insular perspective it was. Because faith is not on the retreat from most of the beaches of the world, only in northern Europe; because religion continues to be a hugely significant factor in global conflict. What is happening today isn't new, it's just that we faith leaders in this country didn't see it, didn't see what was coming and didn't have a clue as to our part in it all. </p> <p>Nineteen years later, Tony Blair consulted 25 faith leaders at Downing Street shortly after September 11, but before we went into Afghanistan. It was a touch harder to be blind to global realities. Indeed, I did wonder out loud why he was wasting his time on religion, which seems to me to have come far too close to discrediting itself for anyone's comfort, let alone God's. </p> <p>We have singularly failed to face up to the inescapable truth that faiths only exist relationally. That is that they simply cannot continue posturing as monopolistic corporations, smugly proclaiming themselves as the finished article, the last word and the ultimate truth. They surely should have discovered by now their own provisionality, fragmentary nature and deep flaws. </p> <p>It is bizarre that we should still affirm a God who would bestow the totality of Her truth on any one group of human beings, and still more bizarre that we should believe in groups of human beings as being capable of grasping the totality of God's truth. Yet when my great friend Rabbi Jonathan Sacks tried to say this in a very, very mild and cautious form the outcry within a section of his own constituency almost overwhelmed him. </p> <p>We have made desperately poor progress on the practical agenda of pooling what is best in our respective traditions for the good of humanity and the globe because we cannot bring ourselves to face up to the theological disclosure implicit in our diversity. </p> <p>In fact, though most religious traditions are big on humility in theory, we do not seem to have a clue what it means. I half-expect to be invited to an international conference on humility and religion in which there are endless papers seeking to demonstrate in which faith the concept of humility originated and who should be awarded the gold medal for being the most humble. </p> <p>But clinging to old imperialistic and triumphal notions in the face of glaring reality is not the only charge against us. We have utterly failed to stand up against the fearful, exploitative and reactionary forces - to be labelled for shorthand and convenience purposes only as \"fundamentalist\" - and allowed them to dominate each of us and the world stage perhaps as never before. I hope it is sufficient to say \"settlers\", \"far-right churches in America\", and \"Islamic extremists\" for us to be clear about whom I am talking. </p> <p>The alibis and excuses - they are not really Christians or Muslims because proper Christians or Muslims do not believe/do those things; you mustn't tar everyone with the same brush, some of them are nice, sincere, peace-loving people; people are entitled to their beliefs, you should listen to them; or, worst of all, \"What can we do?\" - simply underline our moral and spiritual bankruptcy. Wimps, the lot of us. </p> <p>In fact, the situation is getting worse and worse. Except in northern Europe, both Christianity and Islam are growing at a rate so staggering that Matthew Arnold must be spinning. What is emerging is a phenomenon that the Anglican theologian John Bowden has described as \"terrifying\", forms of faith that are \"very hostile to other faiths and driven by a sense of malevolent activity by hostile powers that have to be combated\". Religion which is aggressive, triumphalist and thrives on conflict. </p> <p>Even in Judaism, which is far too small to consider converting Africa or the Far East, it is the \"born again\" proponents of inerrancy who read the texts as divine licence to advance and impose their views by whatever means are necessary. </p> <p>I look at Indonesia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, the Balkans and Sudan, and each instance of bloody conflict has a strong religious dimension. The people involved are Muslims, Christians and Jews, however much they may be behaving in a way that the best or main thrust of their respective traditions contradicts. </p> <p>Lest you jump to the conclusion that I am a naive pacifist, I am not. My Jewish experience tells me that oppression and subjugation don't go away if you acquiesce. Nor am I a self-hating anti-Zionist. I am a Zionist who believes that unless two, viable states are established in Israel/Palestine, the very future of Judaism is threatened and time is rapidly running out. </p> <p>What I do argue is that all faiths, particularly the embarrassingly dysfunctional Abrahamic family, have to acknowledge that no faith tradition is supreme, that no one has a monopoly on God or truth, and that the reality of pluralism discloses a theological obligation to be humble and self-critical, to pool resources, to work together for the good of humanity and the globe rather than fuel its blight and destruction. </p> <p>If only we were able to assert a shared platform that transcended the platitudinous, to stand up to those who pervert our traditions, and to work together for a justice that involves compromise and humility, we might even end up stemming the decline of faith in northern Europe. By demonstrating that religion still offers meaning, purpose and human values, rather than being at best an irrelevance or at worst a bloody disgrace. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Rabbi Tony Bayfield is the head of the Movement for Reform Judaism </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk\">www.reformjudaism.org.uk</a></p>",
  "Money, Great Uncle Funny Money has told me on many occasions throughout my brief and thus far undistinguished life, is the root of all evil. Actually, he may have said \"women\", rather than \"money\", but that's less appropriate to the theme of this little discussion, and is probably just a generational thing. <p>As it happens, I'm not convinced that his thesis stands - money itself has its roots in the need for a convenient way of regulating the exchange of goods and services. Thus, if Great Uncle Funny Money was right, then ultimately convenience is the root of all evil. And that just doesn't have the right ring to it. </p> <p>Anyway, I was reminded of this, as I often am of Great Uncle's opinions, during a conversation with a drunken friend. She was suggesting that The Problem With Society is that we've forgotten how to be idle. That this notion was ventured while lolling in the smooth embrace of a leather couch, through the fumes of a decent Viognier seemed not to strike her as ironic. </p> <p>My first reaction was that as someone who is quite prepared to spend entire mornings attempting to divine accurately the cubic volume of his own navel with the aid of a pipette and a doll's house measuring jug, I couldn't find it in myself to agree. </p> <p>Warming to her theme (or at least going pink in the face - it could have been the Viognier) she put forward the idea that the problem is our obsession with earning money, which is all to do with the protestant work ethic. </p> <p>Personally, I'd say it has more to do with the fact that we have relatively unkind winters in this part of the hemisphere and therefore it's handy to be able to pay the fuel bills, but since her increasingly energetic gesticulating was already threatening to coat me in wine, I forbore to argue. </p> <p>What we need, she'd decided by this point, is a society in which people are provided with enough money to live on and only have to work if they feel like it. (The fact that she didn't think this situation is already in effect is at least proof that she's never picked up a copy of the Daily Mail in her life.) </p> <p>I don't know, though. Is that really something we would want? How long do you think you could be idle before you snapped and they found you licking the telly? After a few days of jumping round the TV channels, fruitlessly seeking programmes that weren't like trying to eat porridge through your eyes, wouldn't you yearn for a bit of photocopying? </p> <p>When you'd read enough magazines to convince yourself once and for all that famous people look a bit ropey with no slap on, wouldn't you start hanging round Companies House, seeing if they had got any small businesses going spare? Being idle's nice, but only because we have to work the rest of the time. </p> <p>Anyway, I distracted her with a copy of Heat and went home to find a pipette.</p>",
  "For a cleric who refuses to talk to, let alone buy the Sunday papers on the grounds of deep religious conviction, Ian Richard Kyle Paisley still gets exercised over what newspapers on the Sabbath day have to say about him. <p>Leaning towards the microphone with a combative eye on the gathering press corps at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, last Wednesday he launched into a blistering attack on the Sundays for daring to suggest he is terminally ill.</p> <p>'Look at me, look at me,' he bellowed as one reporter asked after his health. </p> <p>'I hope to take a few thousand pounds off some newspapers who lied about me. And I would it is just because I happen to be a Protestant and journalists happen to be Romanists that they think they can take it out of me,' Paisley roared. </p> <p>In fact the two 'Romanists' - Paisleyspeak for Catholics - he was referring to are not even Catholics. Alan Murray is an East Belfast Protestant; Liam Clarke is the son of a Presbyterian Minister. They raised questions last weekend about Paisley's participation in talks aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland, scheduled to start on 16 September given the state of the 78-year-old's health.</p> <p>If Paisley ever pursues the journalist's respective papers through the libel courts it will make for a fascinating contest. </p> <p>Both newspapers would request under the rules of disclosure Paisley's medical notes over the last few years. </p> <p>Although pale and gaunt, his dark suit hanging loosely off his shoulders, Paisley made it clear that he would be there to effectively rain on Tony Blair's parade.</p> <p>The Prime Minister's bid to shift the focus away from Iraq and onto the domestic agenda this autumn includes re-engaging with one of the major achievements of his two terms of office - peace and stability in Northern Ireland. Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern will co-chair the final session of talks at Leeds Castle in Kent which are set to run over three days. </p> <p>Downing Street hopes that by 'hothousing' the parties together in a closed environment progress can be made towards bring back powersharing government between unionists and nationalists. The two Premiers and their officials, including Number 10's key negotiator and Blair's chief-of-staff Jonathan Powell, cannot underestimate Paisley's apparent determination to break the talks on the wheel of the IRA's continued existence. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours after Paisley's 'Romanist' outburst the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party appeared to move even further to the right. He intimated that even if the IRA were to disarm and disband his DUP would still not share power with Sinn Fein. Paisley would not even talk directly to Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein President, if the IRA were to decommission. 'Not as a Sinn Feiner,' Paisley said as he stood alone at his solo press conference. </p> <p>Over the summer officials at the Northern Ireland Office and their colleagues in Dublin's Department of Foreign Affairs have tried to talk up the prospects of an autumn deal. </p> <p>They pointed to the seemingly pragmatic noises coming from Paisley's able deputy the East Belfast MP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dodds, arguably the most talented of the DUP's front-bench team who stressed there could be a deal done before next year's Westminster elections. There was even an unspoken hope at Stormont Castle that Paisley's alleged illness would force him out of the talks allowing the younger, ambitious and eager DUP young guns to dictate the party's agenda at the negotiations. Paisley's theatrics and the choreography of his first press conference in months suggest the 'Big Man' is still very much in charge.</p> <p>Before his confrontation with reporters on Wednesday Paisley was surrounded by a cluster of the DUP old guard, all of whom such as the Reverend William McCrea are members of their leader's fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church. </p> <p>The subliminal message transmitted from Paisley's choice of cadres to surround himself was that the party's traditional hard-line on republicanism, its no-compromise unionism, would not be diluted this side of a general election, or perhaps even beyond it. </p> <p>Middle class unionist voters normally turned off by Paisley and his party's fire and brimstone biblical rhetoric abandoned the Ulster Unionists at last November's Assembly elections for the DUP because they were fed up with the outworkings of the Good Friday Agreement. </p> <p>They were frustrated at the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries' refusal to end all violence and they were horrified that a former IRA chief-of-staff, Martin McGuinness, was in charge of their children's education in the now suspended powersharing executive. These are the main reasons why the DUP supplanted the UUP as the leading force in unionism and became the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p> <p>While Paisley was warning journalists at Stormont that some of them 'would be in coffins before I am', his rival David Trimble was being feted several thousand miles away by the US Republican Party at George W. Bush's convention in New York. Trimble has told his party colleagues that all the UUP has to do is sit and wait for the DUP to make the inevitable compromises the Ulster Unionists were forced to make with republicans six years ago.</p> <p>In the words of one key Trimble aide: 'His strategy regarding the DUP is basically \"give them enough rope\". DT thinks that the voters will see the hypocrisy of the DUP saying one thing in opposition and doing the opposite because they crave power.' </p> <p>Northern Ireland's former First Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner is likely to be entering his final year as leader of the UUP. Next year marks the 10th anniversary of Trimble taking control of his party and even some of his closest supporters admit he will use that date to bow out. 'I think David wants to see out his 10 years as leader and then retire on the anniversary, which will coincide with next year's talks. Then a new leader will come forward who will make it easier for the DUP to co-operate with our party,' said one of Trimble's most loyal friends inside the UUP. </p>",
  "<p><strong>Countdown to open access</strong></p> <p>After years of campaigning, ramblers are lacing up their walking boots in anticipation of new countryside laws that will allow greater access to rural land later this month. </p> <p>On September 19, the first phase of the controversial Countryside and Rights of Way Act will open up previously restricted areas of countryside on mountain, moor and common land in the south-east and lower north-west of England. </p> <p>The Peak District will be the first national park to benefit from the new legislation, as 400 new gates and stiles have been installed as well as 250 new signs to show walkers where they can go. </p> <p>According to Nick Barrett, chief executive of The Ramblers Association, the significance of the new \"right to roam\" isn't just about vast areas of land being opened up, but a fundamental shift in the presumption surrounding access to rural areas. \"After centuries of landowner dominance, the new law tips the balance in favour of the general public's access to the countryside,\" he said. </p> <p>But landowners fear for their right to privacy and the safety of livestock, as well as that of walkers who stray into areas near shooting businesses. Caroline Bedell, a surveyor for the Country Land and Business Association, said she has been \"swamped with queries from farmers and land managers who are concerned people view the new act as a general right to roam and not as a restricted right of access to mapped areas.\" </p> <p>The new \"open access areas\" are marked on 32 new ordnance survey maps - the first of which are due out this week - and information about where walkers can go is available from local tourist information centres. The first open areas include parts of Surrey, Kent, Sussex and nine London boroughs, plus parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Merseyside, Great Manchester, Cheshire, Cumbria, Staffordshire and Derbyshire. </p> <p>Walkers will have to wait until the end of 2005 until the \"right of open access\" is rolled out throughout England and Wales. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Further information: <a href=\"http://www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk\">countrysideaccess.gov.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ramblers.org.uk\">ramblers.org.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bulgaria's eco push</strong></p> <p>Bulgaria has identified eco-tourism as a cornerstone for future tourism development. </p> <p>Although there has been huge investment in the package-holiday resorts around the Black Sea, Bulgaria tourism specialist John Todd said the country wants to develop ecotourism in the hinterland, away from the resorts, where there is an enormous amount of pristine countryside. </p> <p>'Bulgaria already has a well-developed network of national parks and protected areas and supports some of the richest biodiversity in Europe,' he said. 'If you add to this an agricultural system based primarily on small organic farms, over 2,000 hot springs, numerous monasteries and roman ruins, it has great potential for developing eco-tourism in the rest of the country.' </p> <p>Bulgaria has nine Unesco world heritage sites, including Pirin National Park and the Rila monastery.</p> <p><strong>Slumber in the jungle </strong></p> <p>The hotel chain Hilton International is planning to build a luxury eco-lodge in the Amazon. The five-star, 196-bed lodge is due to open in 2006 in the Brazilian municipality of Novo Air\u00bfo, an area under environmental protection. </p> <p>It is being developed in consultation with environmental agencies and Indian communities. Local people will be employed as guides to introduce visitors to the sensitive ecosystem and tribal heritage. </p> <p>However, environmentalists are concerned the word \"eco\" is being misused. \"Hilton is using the word in the wrong context,\" said sustainable tourism expert Rachel Dodds. \"It can't be an 'eco' hotel unless it is small scale, has a very limited impact on its surroundings and gives back to the local community.\" </p> <p>Hilton has pledged to donate 2% of gross operating profit to the Amazon Preservation Fund. </p> <p><strong>All aboard that train </strong></p> <p>If you're worried about the contribution flying is making to global warming or just plain worried about flying, why not take the train?

  "<p>Airports operator BAA said it enjoyed its busiest August last month with 14.2 million passengers using its seven airports, an increase of 3.7% on August last year. </p> <p>The figure was only slightly below July's all-time high of 14.21 million and came in spite of British Airways' problems at Heathrow. </p> <p>BAA said the rise, which continued a trend going back several months, brought all sectors of aviation to the same or higher than they were prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001. The recovery in air travel was delayed by the Sars outbreak, the Iraq war and a weak global economy which is only now in robust recovery. </p> <p>BAA said the latest rise was due to surging long-haul and scheduled European flights, which rose 8.3% on the year while European charter flights remained weak, falling 11.2%. </p> <p>Heathrow traffic was up 2% on August last year, at 6.3 million people, Gatwick was up 2.1% while Stansted saw a 9.4% gain to 2.2 million and Southampton an 8.4% increase to 152,000, the last two thanks to increased budget airline flights. </p> <p>Separately, US-based OAG, which monitors global volumes, said world passenger numbers had returned to pre-9/11 levels.</p>",
  "Car bombs, chaotic airports and the prospect of evening tea with a warlord might make most tourists a little queasy. Not, however, 84-year-old Gertrude Lysinger. <p>\"It's been interesting\", said the grandmother from Philadelphia as her tour bus whizzed through western Afghanistan, passing murals of mujahideen martyrs and an abandoned fighter jet. </p> <p>While thousands of American soldiers are scouring Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, for the past fortnight a dozen US tourists with an average age of 74 have been touring the country, after spurning warnings from their friends, family and the state department. </p> <p>\"My kids think we are nuts,\" admitted Richard Glenn, a 79-year-old retired college principal from Ojai, California. </p> <p>Mary Lloyd, a housewife from Phoenix, Arizona, added: \"My daughter said, 'You're flying into a war zone. I'm never going to see you again'. She asked for my last words.\" </p> <p>Challenging the perception of Americans as a stay-at-home nation, the 12 are seasoned travellers. \"We want to see Afghanistan before they start putting up Hiltons and McDonald's. We want to get out and smell the land,\" said Dr Glenn. </p> <p>The tourists have encountered only generosity from ordinary Afghans. \"We make quite a stir wherever we go,\" said Dick Bogart, a retired computer salesman from San Francisco and grandfather of 10. \"It's been very touching.\" </p> <p>On their second day of their tour, however, a car bomb exploded half a mile from their Kabul guesthouse, killing three people. \"That was scary,\" admitted Mrs Lloyd. </p> <p>Later they travelled west to Herat, where they discovered the city had nearly been engulfed in a battle between the governor and a rival warlord two weeks earlier. Undeterred, after touring the city, they had an audience with the governor, Ismail Khan. </p> <p>\"He told us he didn't want to be called a warlord,\" said Mr Bogart. \"It was a very powerful experience.\" </p> <p>Transportation, not terrorism, has been the greatest challenge, said the tour leader Gary Wintz, 57, who last visited Afghanistan in 1978. </p> <p>\"This is one of the most difficult countries on earth,\" he said. \"But I think this is an exceptional group.\" </p> <p>The tour also prompted reflections on America's image abroad; many were openly anti-Bush. </p> <p>\"My main object in life is to get Bush out of the White House,\" said Connie Pencall, a retired teacher. \"He is a terrible, terrible man. We are not welcomed anywhere any more.\" </p> <p>Janet Moore, an Englishwoman who runs a tour company in California, had the idea of bringing the first Americans to tour Afghanistan. </p> <p>Her stepfather, Peter Sanders, was a colonial officer who lost an army to Pashtun tribesmen in 1939. After his death last year she travelled to Afghanistan, accompanied by her 70-year-old mother and five-year-old daughter. They were overwhelmed by the hospitality of the people. </p> <p>After initially filling 20 places for the Afghan tour, at $6,340 (\u00a33,562) each, eight people dropped out after violence escalated in the run-up to next month's Afghan presidential election. </p> <p>The travellers' adventure ends today when they cross the Khyber Pass into Pakistan's North-west Frontier province. \"Don't worry\", joked Mr Wintz. \"We'll be okay.

  "<p>Two clich\u00e9s are indulged today. One is chardonnay, the other shiraz (as the New World calls the grape, France having stuck with syrah). Chardonnay is a village in Burgundy, and for many years that region's white wines were considered the exemplary expression of the grape. But while a few white burgundies are marvellous (though often hugely expensive), the grape can express itself more fully elsewhere. Sicily, for example. <strong> Inycon Chardonnay 2003</strong> is probably its best ever vintage. The oily texture makes the liquid impressively complete and classy. Waitrose has it reduced from \u00a34.99 to \u00a33.74 until October 3, and at that price it must rate 17.5 points out of 20. The wine is also at Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons/Safeway, Somerfield, Booths and the Co-op. The 2002 vintage rates 16.5 points. </p> <p>Chile also turns out toothsome chardonnays. <strong> Anakena Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (16 points, \u00a34.96, Asda) has subtle melon/lemon fruit with a smoky undertone. <strong> Misiones de Rengo Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (15.5 points, \u00a34.47, Asda) is slightly spicier. <strong> Cono Sur Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (16 points, \u00a34.99, Morrisons) has dry peach, lemon and apple. <strong> Casa Leona Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (16 points, \u00a34.99, Marks &amp; Spencer) shows underripe ogen melon. <strong> Casa Lapostolle Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (17 points, \u00a36.49, Booths) combines dryness and finesse with exuberance. Argentina has <strong> Argento Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (16.5 points, \u00a34.99, Co-op, Budgens, Somerfield), which is oily and tangy. From Hungary there is the gooseberryish and melony <strong> Jon Josh Estate Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (15 points, \u00a33.99). </p> <p>The Cape, too, turns out some fine chardonnays. <strong> Somerfield South African Limited Release Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (16 points, \u00a35.99) is creamy, with spiced pear, citrus and pineapple. <strong> Hill &amp; Dale Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (16 points, \u00a34.99, Morrisons) has a tailored elegance. <strong> Jordan Estate Chardonnay 2003 </strong> (16 points, \u00a38.49, Booths) is a classic of creamy lemon, peach and melon. The Cape's master of chardonnay, however, is Danie de Wet, and Somerfield has three of his finest: <strong> Danie de Wet Chardonnay Sur Lie 2004 </strong> (16 points, \u00a34.49; silken, textured, unwooded fruit), <strong> Danie de Wet Barrel Fermented Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (16.5 points, \u00a35.99; leafy citrus with gently smoky ogen melon) and <strong> Danie de Wet Limestone Hill Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (16 points, \u00a36.99; chalkiness with ripe melon and pineapple). </p> <p>California's chardonnays are among the most unguent. The most sumptuous bargain at the moment is Majestic's <strong> Sonoma Creek Chardonnay 2000 </strong> (16 points, \u00a37.99, buy one, get one free). <strong> Sainsbury's California Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (16 points, \u00a33.99) is classy enough to make many a white burgundy at five times the price seem jejune. <strong> Father Oak Paso Robles Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (16 points, \u00a37.99, M&amp;S) is like a creamy lemon balm. <strong> Ravenswood Chardonnay 2002 </strong> (16 points, \u00a36.99, selected Somerfields) offers smoky vegetality, leafy melon and citrus. And <strong> 7th Moon Chardonnay 2001 </strong> (16 points, \u00a35.03, Tesco) has lemon, gooseberry and oily melon. </p> <p>If Burgundy struggles against such competition, Languedoc keeps up smoothly. <strong> Bellefontaine Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc 2002 </strong> (16 points, \u00a33.89, Booths) unites opulence and fine citrus. <strong> Gold Label Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc 2003 </strong> (15.5 points, \u00a34.99, M&amp;S) offers unhurried melon and citrus. </p> <p>Shiraz has swept all before it, much like chardonnay. Again, we head first to Sicily, and <strong> Inycon Shiraz 2002 </strong> (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), which releases its fruit by degrees, so the palate first gets toasty berries, then molten tannins. It's \u00a34.99 at Sainsbury's and Waitrose, but the latter is flogging it for \u00a33.74 until October 3. It must rate 17 points - as does <strong> Casillero del Diablo Shiraz 2002 </strong> (\u00a35.49 at Somerfield, \u00a35.47 at Asda), from Chile, in which earthy herbs merge with the tannins. </p> <p>Chile has other tasty shirazes, too. <strong> Errazuriz Syrah 2001 </strong> (16 points, \u00a35.99, Budgens) has juicy chutzpah, while <strong> Condor Chilean Shiraz 2003 </strong> (16 points, \u00a33.99, Morrisons) has lingeringly tangy tannins. </p> <p>Argentina has <strong> Trivento Reserve Syrah 2001 </strong> (16.5 points, \u00a34.99, Somerfield), which pulsates with chocolate and tobacco nuances. Majestic also has a syrah, the red partner of the chardonnay above, and on the same deal <strong> Sonoma Creek 1999 </strong> is a soft, handsomely mature red that, at two for \u00a37.99, rates 16 points. </p> <p>The Cape has several entries in the shiraz race. We have room here for two: <strong> Douglas Green Shiraz 2003 </strong> (15.5 points, \u00a34.92, Asda), which is juicy, but has some backbone from the tannins; and <strong> Riebeck Cellars Shiraz Reserve 2003 </strong> (15.5 points, \u00a35.98, 40 branches of Asda), with its lively berries and pert tannins. </p> <p>Other southern French areas than the Rh\u00f4ne (where syrah hails from) are now syrah-serious. Booths has the splendid <strong> Domaine la Bastide Syrah Vieilles Vignes Vin de Pays d'Hauterive 2001 </strong> (16 points, \u00a34.99), which has a tobacco-tinged opulence that finishes searingly dry. But it is the Aussies who have made shiraz their all-conquering grape, and you can get your daily dose for 58p a glass with <strong> Tesco's Australian Shiraz </strong> three-litre winebox (15 points, \u00a314.15) - it is like brisk jam, with the occasional pip adding texture. Going up a class, and a few bob, <strong> Chteau Reynella Basket Pressed Shiraz 2001 </strong> is worth acquiring for its gloriously accommodating complexity - down from \u00a313.99 to \u00a310.49 at Waitrose, until October 3, it rates 16.5 points. </p> <p> <strong> Visit <a href=\"http://www.superplonk.com\">superplonk.com</a> for hundreds more chardonnays and shirazes.</strong></p>",

  "<p>For some people, loafing is a full time occupation. For others, the need to make money and pay the bills restricts their loafing to a part-time occupation. Think of actors like Love Actually star Bill Nighy, who confesses that between films he loafs at every opportunity. Likewise, Capital Radio DJ and occasional chat show host Johnny Vaughan, who is a champion of the art. Like the staff of the Idler magazine, they deplore the Protestant work ethic that marries virtue to hard work. </p> <p>The people who wrote in to the Idler last year to tell readers of the jobs they accepted between loafing, fared much worse. Their stories have been compiled in Crap Jobs, a 157-page book filled with stomach churning tales. </p> <p>Editor Dan Kieran says he was surprised by the number of people who said their high-flying, full-on career was, in fact, mundane and should, more accurately, be described as a crap job. </p> <p>\"All jobs seem to be crap, whatever they are,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I think the concept of a job is completely outdated. It is a 19th century construct - selling your labour by the hour. Some people had a job for life, but even that's gone now. I think we need to reassess our relationship with work because the way we live doesn't make sense,\" he says </p> <p>\"For instance, you don't need people watching ready meals go along a conveyor belt. They are working because other people are working too hard, and don't have the time to cook. It's part of the western system of over-work and over-consumption.\" </p> <p>He argues we should end our fixation with careers and accept the need for a little loafing. \"It's the lazy who make life more interesting.\" </p> <p>Crap Jobs documents 100 of the worst occupations picked by readers. Here we choose some of the worst stinkers. </p> <p><strong>Night petrol cashier: </strong>It's tedious, soul destroying work, says one contributor. \"You're locked in, there's no escape. You're made to feel like a terminally bored zoo exhibit. </p> <p>\"Even Jesus would have lost patience had he been forced to hunt down snack foods and dairy products all night. </p> <p>\"Of course there was more to the job. I had to contend with dodgy scallies trying out newly stolen credit cards, those doing runners after filling up, and those who fling bottles and bags of coal around the forecourt. There were also the nightly thrills of the two-hour stock-take and floor mopping.\" </p> <p><strong> Phone sex-line operator: </strong>One of the best paid jobs highlighted in the book, a contributor says the manual given to new staff was the highlight. \"It contained gems such as 'phrases men like to hear from you', with 'I'm separating my arse cheeks' in the top 10. Also there was an excellent 'dictionary of filth', scripts for 'Lesbian Watersports' and a 'Guide for the Dominatrix'. </p> <p>Yet the initial fascination with guiding male callers to a sexual climax wore off quickly. \"It is quite shocking how this all very quickly becomes mundane,\" she says. </p> <p><strong> Battery breaker: </strong>Not your average torch battery - they just go straight into landfill sites. These monsters are industrial strength batteries from trains. In a hangar somewhere there are blokes (and they are all men) breaking open batteries to retrieve the lead core. \"You'd drain the acid, slam the battery at an angle to break the pitch seal, and then the lead core would fly out,\" says Stephen Murray. The acid was always a problem. \"It always found a way in,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Pea checker: </strong>This is Mr Kieran's favourite...standing by a conveyor belt picking out discoloured peas. Like many workers on conveyor belts, a glance away and \"you feel as though everything around you is moving\". </p> <p><strong> Kebab shop assistant: </strong>Much worse than pea checking. \"You take about 10Kg of defrosting lamb mince and mix it with 'secret ingredients' (spices salt, pepper and volume-increasing 'grit'). Then you grab a huge handful of the freezing mixture, form it into a doughnut shape and then push it over a three-foot pole that is welded to a metal base.\" Repeat the process until you have the fully-fledged \"tower of meat\". Then make another one...and another one. </p> <p><strong>North Sea ferry cabin cleaner: </strong>Let's face it, the North Sea is never kind. So working in the bowels of a ferry with a cargo of fat truckers can only make worse. Just a snippet from this long tale of woe is enough to turn off most jobseekers. </p> <p>There are some benefits, apparently. \"At night ... we would all pile into one of the crew cabins and get slaughtered on duty free. There were more girls than geezers and, needless to say, in the absence of DVDs, Playstations and good TV, there were lots and lots of sexual relationships: three, four, five in a bed - you name it.\" </p> <p>Vomit and worse, however, was never far away. </p> <p><strong>Maggot farmer: </strong>It goes without saying that anything to do with maggots is not for the squeamish. </p> <p>In this case, there was an Olympic-sized swimming pool squirming with millions, if not billions, of maggots feeding on rotting animal carcasses and fish. The carcasses must be turned regularly. Nice. </p> <p>Then there is the other hangar with \"breeding\" flies that must be cleaned out and the babies - or maggots - transferred to the swimming pool. Lovely. </p> <p><strong>Trainee solicitor: </strong>It's not just the grubby and monotonous jobs people hate. They also despise jobs that make up the first stages of a glittering career.

Those wanting to study a postgrad course in port management in Europe have two choices - a course in English is offered in Antwerp, or for something a bit closer to home there's one offered by Plymouth University. </p> <p>Its MSc in port management sits neatly alongside two sister courses in international shipping and international logistics, and while it's not the biggest of the three, it's the fastest growing. </p> <p>However, according to the man who runs the course, Michael Roe, port management doesn't attract many UK students for the simple reason that getting funding is so difficult. \"We aren't keen on taking recent graduates unless there are really, really good. Most of our students are young professionals in the 25-35 age group who have been working in a port or related environment since graduating.\" </p> <p>By that he means freight forwarding or logistics - one thing he makes very clear is that he will not accept anyone with anything less than a 2:1 unless there are exceptional circumstances. If you can persuade him to give you a place the course divides into three main areas - two taught terms and a dissertation. The winter and spring terms are spent learning standard business modules such as law, economics and IT but, according to Michael, they are all taught from a ports perspective. </p> <p>\"Students won't be working their way through oceans of English law - everything is examined on the basis of how it relates to the business of running a port.\" </p> <p>Students have the option of studying some of the modules offered on the syllabuses of the two related courses, and there are plenty of lectures by speakers from the ports and closely related industries that students are required to attend. </p> <p>\"When it come to the dissertation most of our students seem to disappear off to one of the big ports to conduct their research. While it's not required, we do encourage students to conduct some research within the industry that they will go on and work in,\" he says. </p> <p>The port business is very much an international business and lots of jobs available to those who have completed the course will be outside the UK. That said, Tilbury, Southampton, Felixstowe and Immingham on the Humber are thriving and need senior mangers.</p> <p>Fees for the course are around \u00a33,500. The course has 30-40 students studying full-time, over one year, and there are places available for 'exceptional candidates' - but you'll have to move fast.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",

  "<p>Reformation: Europe's House Divided, by Diarmaid MacCulloch (Penguin, \u00a39.99) </p> <p> MacCulloch's heroic 800-page exploration of the major theological, political and social revolutions that convulsed Europe from 1490 to 1700 is a genuine pleasure from start to finish, thanks to his wise and amiable stewardship. He begins with a carved figure in a Buckinghamshire church \"displaying his ample buttocks towards the high altar\" and ends with an Elizabethan gentleman's beautiful meditation on the folly of Christians being \"miserably divided about Christ\". In between,he covers the development of the printing press, the counter-reformation and the mass slaughter of the Thirty Years war (1618-48). He also provides so many informative biographies - from Erasmus, Luther and Calvin to Cranmer, Ignatius Loyola and Spinoza - that no review could do justice to his awesome scholarship. Without doubt a worthy winner of this year's Wolfson prize for history. <strong>IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Rifles: Six Years with Wellington's Legendary Sharpshooters, by Mark Urban (Faber, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> The introduction of the rifle in warfare gave the military a headache: should they grant the rifleman power to kill on his own initiative or rein him in to a formation, thereby slowing him down? The 95th Rifles were unusual in emphasising individual initiative, and Urban skilfully recreates the lives of six members of the regiment as they leave Dover in 1809 and are force-marched through the Peninsular campaign to the battle of Waterloo. This is Sharpe territory, and the cover bears a comradely puff from Bernard Cornwell, but Urban's access to private letters and journals gives his account an authentic voice. The narrative is nothing short of cinematic, and the battle scenes are gripping stuff. Urban's journalistic instincts (he is diplo-matic editor of Newsnight) impel him to confront the less glorious deeds of some of the men, but on the whole this is a celebration of the legendary sharpshooters. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Victorian Sensation: Or the Spectacular, the Shocking and the Scandalous in Nineteenth-Century Britain, by Michael Diamond (Anthem, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> The Victorians delighted in sensation (defined here as \"a condition of excited feeling produced in a community by some occurrence\"). In the mid-19th century, daily newspapers became more affordable and the development of the railways meant they reached a wider public. People lapped up stories of royal sex scandals and assassination attempts and were able to read every lurid detail of a murder trial or divorce case. The undoubted stars of the era were Oscar Wilde, Charles Parnell and Jack the Ripper, but Diamond has also unearthed some lesser-known sensations, including Ernest (\"Stella\") Boulton and William (\"Fanny\") Park, who were arrested leaving the Strand Theatre wearing women's clothes \"padded at the breast\". Diamond demonstrates that the Victorians pretty much invented our celebrity-obsessed, sensation-seeking modern media. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> My Life, by Giuseppe Garibaldi (Hesperus, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Introducing these memoirs, the novelist Tim Parks refers to them as \"incendiary material\". This can only be because they are rather dry, illuminated by occasion sparks of incandescent rage and patriotic zeal. A soldier is not given to introspection, and Garibaldi's rather utilitarian prose comes alive only when he gets angry, usually with priests and policemen, but also the papacy. \"None of the wounded complained,\" he writes after one battle, \"the only cry that could be heard from those under the surgeon's knife was 'Long live Italy!' When a people reaches this point, it is time for the Pope with his tiara, the foreign bullies and the dom-estic tyrants to leave.\" This is the first English translation from Garibaldi's manuscripts, written between campaigns. He comes across as a shrewd judge of character and is rightly dismissive of the \"meaningless civilities\" of politicians, who prefer to do nothing and \"keep their snouts in the trough of the public exchequer\". Plus \u00e7a change. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Adventure of English, by Melvyn Bragg (Sceptre, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Underpinned by the research behind the TV series of the same name and Radio 4's 25-part Routes of English , this \"biography of a language\" displays the benefits of its lengthy genesis as it advances with captivating assurance and enthusiasm across 15 centuries, bringing a remarkable wealth of telling examples, from the lexical legacy of fifth-century Germanic warriors to today's Caribbean patois or Singaporean \"Singlish\". Bragg shows that the language narrowly survived potential extinction by Viking and Norman invaders, broke out of marginality thanks to such heroes as King Alfred, Chaucer, Tyndale and Shakespeare, and thereafter travelled to every continent with results that leave standard English ambiguously poised - supreme in commerce and international bodies, yet now just one of a plethora of versions described in the later chapters, and soon likely to be the tongue of a minority of English-speakers. <strong>JD</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Broken Music: A Memoir, by Sting (Pocket, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> A former English teacher as well as a singer-songwriter, Sting writes with far more verve than your average reminiscing rock musician and takes care to jazz up the linear structure a little as he chronicles his childhood in a doomed Tyneside shipyard town, his scuffling years of donning a suit by day and a bass guitar at night, and the move to punk-era London that led to global fame. But his past and present careers have disadvantages too, resulting in pretentious allusions and images (writing of his multi-stranded early-70s life as a \"chaotic fugue\", for instance). And though his memoir has been praised for candour, that has its limits: while openly remorseful about shunning his parents' funerals, he tidies away the enigmatic break-ups of both the Police and his first marriage in a terse single paragraph. Still, the book effectively ends when he turns 30, leaving scope for a second volume covering those splits more fully. JD</p>",
  "<p><strong>Around the World in 80 Days, by Jules Verne (2 hours, CSA Word, \u00a312.99 CD)</strong></p> <p>The upside of global travel these days is that it is no longer the preserve of the rich and privileged. The downside is that it has lost all the glamour, romance and excitement that it had when only wealthy eccentrics such as Mr Phileas Fogg, hero of Verne's classic, could afford to globetrot. Even if you have seen cinema versions of the novel, you will be as enchanted by the elegance and wit of the original story as you were dazzled by the extravagant visual effects of the films.</p> <p>To win a \u00a320,000 bet, the unflappable Fogg and his eminently flappable French manservant, Passepartout, set out to girdle the Earth as fast as is humanly possible in 1872. This has to be the golden age of travel if your idea of bliss includes hackney carriages, Pullman trains and steamships, supplemented with the occasional howdah, sedan chair or sail-driven sledge. There are adventures round every corner: a beautiful Parsee widow is rescued from death-by-suttee; Passepartout loses his master and is forced to join a team of acrobats in Yokohama; the American transcontinental train is ambushed by Sioux; and, with their destination in sight, there's a spectacular fire at sea. Fogg remains cool to the end.</p> <p>Reader Andrew Sachs is a one-man cast of thousands; his compendium of accents, characters and moods is both inexhaustible and breathtaking. My only gripe is that it has been abridged - it's such a short book, was this really necessary?</p> <p><strong>Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift (2hrs 22 mins, Furicano, \u00a312.99 CD)</strong></p> <p>Most of us remember Gulliver's Travels part one as a school textbook, but apart from Eng Lit anoraks few people come back for a second helping. This is a pity because even if you know nothing about the contemporary political and social issues Swift was poking fun at, it's an adventure story every bit as entertaining as Robinson Crusoe. Swift's prose is less pedantic than Defoe's, but in any case reader Daniel Philpott does all the hard work. What's more, he does it beautifully - no gimmicks, he just reads it simply and clearly, and at a stroke you find yourself observing the extraordinary miniature world of Lilliput with the same curiosity and fascination as the man-mountain Lemuel Gulliver.</p>",
  "<p>In 1492, Christopher Columbus \"discovered\" America. Six years later, a petty Portuguese nobleman called Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached India. These were, as Adam Smith called them, \"the two greatest events recorded in the history of mankind\". They marked the beginning of a great age of exploration and maritime trade, which resulted by the 19th century in complete western domination of the world. </p> <p>Or so the old story goes, still found in books that describe how the modern world was created by the west, Europe, Britain, even Scotland; how from 1490 onwards, brave and resourceful Europeans ventured out into the great unknown, and showed isolated and backward natives everywhere the benefits of free trade, science, technology, and democracy. </p> <p>Asia usually appears in such accounts as the passive beneficiary of some irrepressibly dynamic and uniquely gifted white people. But as the ambitious new exhibition at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Encounters: The Meeting of Asia and Europe 1500-1800, makes clear, Europeans were latecomers in the network of global trade and communications established by Arabs, Persians, Indians and the Chinese. While much of Europe lay torpid in the Dark Ages, Buddhism and Islam were travelling East through the Silk Route, and Arab, African and Indian merchants were crisscrossing the Indian ocean and the China seas. </p> <p>Much before the 1490s, Arab and Persian sailors had gone up the west coast of Africa and into the Mediterranean. A Chinese sailor sailed up the east coast of Africa in the early 15th century. In fact, Vasco da Gama had dared to aim as far as the East Indies mostly because of navigational technologies developed in China and the Islamic Middle East and then diffused across Europe; and it was an Indian Muslim sailor who led Vasco da Gama to India after the latter had lost his way and ended up in east Africa. </p> <p>Columbus, Vasco da Gama and their European successors come across in contemporary accounts and their own writings as cruel, even slightly deranged. Fortunately, the capacity for murder and pillage they displayed in the Americas was limited in Asia. In India, and then China and Japan, the buccaneers, missionaries, sailors, soldiers and diplomats of Europe faced rich and sophisticated states and societies, which wanted little from them and confined them to white ghettos on the coast. </p> <p>The world economy then was dominated by the luxury goods - silk, ceramics, spices - produced by Asia. Not surprisingly, Vasco da Gama provoked derisive laughter in India when he produced the gifts he had brought from Europe. The British and Dutch traders who successfully undermined their Portuguese rivals in Asia by the 17th century only entered Asian trade with the help of gold and silver extracted from Europe's American colonies. </p> <p>Personal contacts with Asian peoples were achieved fitfully by missionaries, mostly Jesuits, men of the Counter-Reformation hoping to make up in Asia for Catholic losses in Europe. The Jesuits also introduced Asians to western advances in cartography, astronomy and clockmaking. But the story of the Jesuit mission in Asia is largely one of naive hopes and disappointment. </p> <p>With an early agricultural and industrial revolution, and three path-breaking inventions (printing, gunpowder, and the compass) in its past, China was then a great economic and scientific power, if serenely self-absorbed. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci managed to get to know the country better than any European before him while trying to figure out why it was indifferent to Christianity. </p> <p>But for most Europeans who knew of China or Asia at all they were no more than the source of exotic furnishing, porcelain, cotton, silks and wallpaper. The V&amp;A exhibition displays many of these objects of European desire as well as the western forms of art and technology - clocks, guns, maps, lenses - adopted by Asians during the 300 years when economic and cultural globalisation wasn't the overwhelming phenomenon it later became under the aegis of European imperialism. In their introduction to the exhibition's catalogue, the curators claim that the \"boundaries between different cultures\" weren't fixed; and that until 1800 they were marked by \"fluidity and hybridity\". </p> <p>The concepts of fluidity and hybridity are much cherished today in our globalised, multicultural societies; and the V&amp;A has done well to attempt a contemporary spin on the early encounters of Asia and Europe. But, as with present-day globalisation, it is hard to marvel at the free flow and consumption of diverse commodities and artefacts without wondering whether they advanced understanding and sympathy across nations and cultures at the same time. </p> <p>The evidence from the past is only partly encouraging. The few Asians who met Europeans tended to treat them pompously and arrogantly, and they remained largely ignorant of Europe until they began to feel its new power. Steven Parissien notes correctly in the catalogue that \"the Asians responsible for the exotic imports remained an unknown quantity to most in the West, their homelands far-away countries about which most Europeans preferred to know nothing\". Dr Johnson described all Asiatics as \"barbarians\", and conceded only, when pressed by Boswell, that the Chinese were not bad at pottery. Visiting China in 1792 on a diplomatic mission, Lord Macartney observed that the British expatriates in Canton mixed rarely with the Chinese; they may have sympathised with Philip Larkin, who wanted to visit China only if he could return the same day. </p> <p>Lord Macartney also saw that China had grown militarily weak; and in the mid-19th century, the British called China's bluff. They had Indian opium to sell and found that they could bully the Chinese into buying it. Much of their confidence was due to unexpected success in India, where as the over-extended Moghul empire imploded in the 18th century, a vast subcontinent lay open to a multitude of warlords, both Indian and foreign. Swift British victories in India stoked imperial greed across western Europe. China was one of its victims, with Britain, France, Russia, and even Germany tormenting in turn and often together the once-invincible Middle Kingdom. </p> <p>By 1800, the east, with its great declining empires (Ottoman, Moghul, Qing), no longer appeared very mysterious or admirable to the British. In 1783, while accusing the British East India Company of ruining Indian society and economy, Edmund Burke had dealt impatiently with the suggestion that Indians were an uncivilised people. He asserted that Indians were \"people for ages civilised and cultivated - cultivated by all the arts of polished life, whilst we were yet in the woods\". Such regard for non-European cultures became rare in the 19th century, when mass industrial production and technologically advanced armaments made Britain the supreme military and economic power in the world, and led it to easy conquests in Asia and Africa. </p> <p>Lord Macaulay thought that Indian learning was mostly worthless, and even John Stuart Mill assumed that Indians had to first grow up under British tutelage before they could accept the good things - democracy, economic freedom, science - that the west had to offer them. </p> <p>This liberal paternalism rarely became as obsessive as the later rhetoric of the New Imperialism, which George Orwell described as \"a sort of forcible evangelising\" (\"You turn a Gatling gun on a mob of unarmed natives and then you establish 'The Law' which includes roads, railways and a court-house\"). The \"white man's burden\" - creating law and order, promoting the superior civilisation of the west - grew heavy only later in the 19th century. But then it was, as Orwell noted, always borne by the black and brown man. </p> <p>It was especially heavy in the slave colonies of the New World that helped fuel the industrial revolution in England. It grew onerous in India as the East India Company acquired control over the eastern provinces of Bengal and Bihar, and as extortionate British demands for revenue forced Indian landholders and peasants into debt and destitution. Ironically, as the British historian Percival Spear wrote, \"the days of corrupt Company officials, of ill-gotten fortunes, of oppression\" were \"also the days when Englishmen were interested in Indian culture, wrote Persian verses, and foregathered with Pandits and Maulvis and Nawabs on terms of social equality and personal friendship\". Such British officials as William Jones and Warren Hastings enquired into Indian religions, laws, customs, literature and art, inaugurating a British tradition of scholarship that was weakened considerably in the 19th century by men who shared Lord Macaulay's views of Indian learning. </p> <p>There were few white women in India; and, faced with prolonged celibacy, European expatriates had often acquired Indian wives and mistresses. A few British men continued to go native in this fashion even in the 19th century, when large numbers of eligible British women had begun to arrive in India, and the British in the coastal towns of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were already living racially sequestered lives. David Ochterlony, the British Resident in Delhi, went parading around the city every evening with each one of his 13 concubines on a separate elephant. Men like him, busy expediting British rule over India, were probably happy to escape the drab ghettos of the coastal towns, and to act out sexual fantasies which the envious bores at the church and the club would have denounced as Oriental decadence. </p> <p>But these \"Nabobs\" still differed from previous foreign ruling elites in India, such as the Muslims from Persia and Central Asia, who had blended into the general population, and fashioned gradually a distinctive Indo-Islamic civilisation, of which the Taj Mahal, Urdu poetry, and North Indian dress and cuisine are the more conspicuous examples. Most of the Nabobs hoped to make their fortune quickly, before the onset of tropical disease, and then return to Britain. </p> <p>No Taj Mahal was ever likely to emerge out of the Indo-British encounter. The hybrid art and architecture produced by it remained resolutely minor, occasionally rising to the pleasing kitsch of the Brighton Pavilion and Company School paintings. This was also the trend wherever Asians and Europeans worked together. Few of the objects built to appease European taste in Oriental luxuries, or the Asian artworks inspired by fantasies of Europe, match the glories of Renaissance Europe, Ming China and Moghul India. </p> <p>Ideas were more fruitfully exchanged, most importantly in the realms of military technology, law, administration and nation-building, with consequences that are still working themselves out. Cultural assimilation, as it is known today, was rare on either side. Few Asians wished, or managed, to travel to Europe. And understanding Oriental cultures seemed to have grown harder for many Europeans arriving in the east three centuries after Matteo Ricci. </p> <p>TE Lawrence, who went famously native in Arabia, confessed to being brought close to madness by his efforts \"to live in the dress of Arabs, and imitate their mental foundation\". They deprived him, he wrote, of his \"English self\" without helping him turn his \"Arab skin\" into anything more than an \"affectation\". </p> <p>It is not surprising that all the detailed and precise western knowledge about the East - the travel books, missionary accounts, administrators' gazettes - did not much help Lawrence in what was, essentially, an effort at empathy. Ruskin had despaired in the middle of the great age of British expansion and exploration: \"If only we English, who are so fond of travelling in body, would also travel a little in the soul!\" </p> <p>But then to explore the soul was not easy for the selfless and honest men serving the impersonal bureaucracy of empire, such as TE Lawrence, who managed to persuade himself that, as a British secret agent, he was bringing political independence to Arabs, only to realise later that he had been part of an imperial effort to secure the \"corn and rice and oil of Mesopotamia\". </p> <p>The white man's burden was always more trouble than it was worth - as was proved again recently by the Anglo-American misadventure in Mesopotamia. But men conscious of this burden would change the world for ever, subjecting its great diversity to their own singular outlook, and reducing in the process potentially rich encounters with other peoples and countries to monologues about the unassailable superiority of modern western politics, economy, and culture. </p> <p>They rarely noticed that western efforts, however sincere or altruistic, to modernise supposedly backward Asians incited more resentment than admiration or gratitude. Expelled from their old social and political order, and denied dignity in a west-dominated world, aggrieved natives wanted to beat the west at its own game. The Chinese intellectual in Andr\u00e9 Malraux's prescient novel The Temptation of the West (1926) says, \"Europe thinks she has conquered all these young men who now wear her garments. But they hate her. They are waiting for what the common people call her 'secrets'.\" </p> <p>Japan was the first to imitate western techniques, and aim at world domination. Modernising China now poses a formidable challenge to the west - more calibrated than the one presented by radical Islamists. Observing a humiliated country in 1889, Kipling had wondered: \"What will happen when China really wakes up, runs a line from Shanghai to Lhasa, and controls her own gun factories and arsenals?\" This old anxiety now has a strong basis as an aggressively nationalistic China rises swiftly, the words once used to dismiss its potential - \"insular\" and \"arrogant\" - are applied to its rival, the United States, and, with India waiting in the wings, the dominance of the west begins to appear yet another phase in the long history of empires and civilisations. </p> <p>Looking back at the journeys of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama, Adam Smith had written, \"What benefits, or what misfortunes to mankind may hereafter result from these great events, no human wisdom can foresee.\" The books that tell us \"How the west/Europe/Britain/ made the Modern World\" seem to imply that we know better now. Perhaps, it is time to congratulate ourselves, or at least to celebrate what the catalogue of the forthcoming V&amp;A exhibition calls a \"dynamic period of commercial, artistic, and technological exchange\". Certainly, the evidence for this would be compelling when the exhibition opens next week, even if the mute, obdurate beauty of lacquer and porcelain cannot express the melancholy truth that, as Walter Benjamin once put it, \"there is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\". </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pankaj Mishra's An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World will be published by Picador in October.

  "<p><strong>Cities</strong><br>by John Reader<br>400pp, William Heinemann \u00a320</p> <p>Polluting, parasitic, overcrowded and violent: cities have always been popular with humans. They've needed to be. From the 35,000 inhabitants of Sumerian Ur, 4,000 years ago, to the current chart-topper - Tokyo, home to 26 million - cities have consistently buried more people than they have produced. They also eat more food than they grow, drink more water than they collect and, the inevitable consequence, excrete more sewage than they know what to do with. But, for all their faults, we like these greedy, incontinent monsters. Half the world's population lives in cities, and that share is growing.</p> <p>In Cities, John Reader tries to explain how these people-swallowing beasts first took shape and then grew to become the complex, no less voracious entities of today, by taking \"an ecological point of view\". Cities are what they eat, and thus dependent on the rural hinterland which feeds them (or, which they exploit for their own unnatural purposes). By the same token, these robber-baron metropolises are more vulnerable than they seem. A city that fouls its own groundwater with salt, or builds roads too narrow to transport the grain it needs, or simply forgets to pay its respects to the local earthquake god, will find itself crumbling just as surely as Ur did, or as Rome did later, or as Los Angeles may yet do. Ignore the environment at your peril, is Reader's implicit counsel to cities then and now. Without a viable hinterland, a city is fit only for vultures and archaeologists.</p> <p>Reader's story begins on the alluvial flood plain between the Tigris and the Euphrates where the cities of ancient Sumer were founded 6,000 years ago. Fertile soil and the ease of digging irrigation canals allowed the production of an agricultural surplus, which, many experts argue, is the vital precondition of a city's existence. Many other experts argue that only cities could have enabled the production of that extra food in the first place. While the experts argue over this hill of beans, Reader separates chicken and egg by proposing a class of itinerant artisans whose technological know-how enabled villages eventually to grow enough food to support these skilled wanderers, who then settled within them, turning villages into skills-differentiated communities, or cities.</p> <p>But, once founded, cities had to feed themselves, and all cities tend to grow. Neither the cities of Greece nor Rome possessed Mesopotamia's bread basket. Both had to import. Rome at its peak consumed 5,000 tons of grain every week, a mere scattering on the floor of a modern bulk container, Reader observes, but enough to require 10,000 ox-carts (top speed: 3km/hr) travelling on roads which, although impeccably straight, were too narrow for two-way traffic. Feeding Rome was a daily logistical miracle achieved, as the city grew ever larger, only by the maintenance of a fleet of grain ships, the invention of temperature-controlled (and weevil-proof) grain silos, the construction of a new harbour and the annexing of crops from as far away as Egypt. But Rome outgrew even this formidable supply system, which collapsed within the larger catastrophe of her empire.</p> <p>An industrious infancy followed by middle-aged spread, leading to a gluttonous old age and sudden death by starvation would seem to be the life-cycle of the city. Reader lists the successive urban pretenders to the \"world's biggest\" throne. Changan, under the Tang dynasty, numbered more than 1 million people between 618 and 907, after which it was topped by Baghdad (currently the world's least desirable city, scoring 14.5 liveability points against New York's normative 100), then Cordoba and Constantinople, which shared the honour during the 10th century. Fez scrambled to the top spot around the end of the 12th century, but stayed there a scant 20 years before being toppled by Polonnaruwa, the then-capital of modern Sri Lanka, which managed about the same before beginning the long slide down to its present status: a collection of picturesque ruins and a Dutch-built visitors' centre.</p> <p>Cities, then, came and went until the beginning of the 19th century, when they began only to come. Cities sprang up everywhere, sometimes in the most inappropriate places. Tokyo's growth has not been checked by its lack of an adequate water supply, nor Los Angeles by the same lack, or even by the local surfeit of earthquakes. And throughout the 20th century, all cities everywhere have ballooned in size whether they possess the infrastructure to support their populations or, like Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, patently do not. A fascinating chapter on urban agriculture tells us that one in two Taiwanese families grow their own food and metropolitan Havana produces 60% of its own vegetables (organic ones too, thanks to the US embargo on artificial fertiliser) but these exotic versions of Britain's humble allotment system hardly explain why cities now thrive where once they would have died.</p> <p>Reader's ecological model cannot account for the success of modern cities, which is a disadvantage for his argument but perhaps an advantage for his book. Description and capsule explanations displace theory as we move briskly through the city-states of Renaissance Italy, the invention of double-entry book-keeping, bills of exchange and the beginnings of modern capitalism. This is familiar material, put together, as the whole book is, from a broad swath of secondary sources, but Reader's magpie eye still picks out gems. The high levels of urban violence in 16th-century Italy he links to the wide difference in marriage age (men: mid-30s; women: mid-teens), the corollary being that young Italian men had decades in which to do nothing but get into trouble. Such observations may lack methodological rigour, and perhaps strict relevance too, but they are never boring.</p> <p>This is just as well, for the remainder of Cities is a collage of case studies, anecdotes, statistics and potted histories marshalled under loosely themed chapter headings. The pleasure of the rest of Reader's book is sometimes in this very looseness. A chapter on the energy needs of modern cities begins, arrestingly enough, with the effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima but then, instead of the expected segue into nuclear power, Reader chooses to explain the excellence of Hiroshima's subsequent tomato crop, which was abundant and pest-free as never before. The blast had sterilised the soil and the ash had fertilised it. A chapter on sewage systems is more cogent, and just as entertaining, as its charts the progress down the Seine of \"huge vile rafts of lumpy chocolate mousse\" to their eventual separation into fertiliser (in which grew fruit and vegetables as paradoxically delicious as Hiroshima's tomatoes) and water pure enough to drink.</p> <p>Cities is, finally, a celebration of its subject's refusal to be explained or controlled. Hippodamus of Miletus first imposed the grid system on a city in 500 BC. Twenty-four centuries later, the United States Land Registry extended the system to a whole country, dividing virgin territory into neat township-sized squares. Reader concludes by evoking a city's \"ecological footprint\", or the total land necessary to support it, which may be scattered all over the globe. We modern city-dwellers eat prawns netted off the coast of Tanzania with forks made of cheap Chinese steel. Our cities are not checkerboards but shifting archipelagoes of appetite. They sprawl. They seethe. They're just as hungry as they always were and, as Cities demonstrates, there's no accounting for their tastes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lawrence Norfolk's novel In the Shape of a Boar is published by Orion</p>",
  "<p>In July 1924, the Borges family returned to Buenos Aires after a year in Europe. Now 24, Jorge Luis (\"Georgie\") had been writing poetry since his teenage years. In Spain, he had been influenced by a group of avant-garde poets known as \"El Ultra\", and aimed to bring their movement to Argentina. In October he read James Joyce's Ulysses, published in Paris the year before. He wrote a review, exulting in being, as he put it, \"the first Hispanic adventurer to have arrived at Joyce's book\". Joyce was a kindred spirit who had done for the Irish what Borges had himself, as yet vaguely, envisaged doing for the Argentines.</p> <p>At the same time, he was becoming fascinated by a 17-year-old writer, Norah Lange. On October 26 he told his friend Guillermo de Torre that he was thinking of translating a passage from Ulysses, and in the same letter referred no fewer than three times to Norah. A month or two earlier, he had undertaken to help her with the publication of her first book of poems, La calle de la tarde (Evening Street). He negotiated a price with Samet, the publisher, arranged for it to be reviewed and for a selection of the poems to be published in Martin Fierro magazine, together with his prologue, where he praised Lange in a high-flown lyrical style - she was \"illustrious for the double brilliance of her hair and her haughty youth\"; she was \"light and haughty and fervent, like a banner unfurling in the breeze\".</p> <p>A good part of Lange's attraction lay in the exoticism of her family background. Her father, Gunnar Lange, was Norwegian, while her mother, Berta Erfjord, though Argentine born, was the daughter of a Norwegian and an Irishwoman. Norah, the fourth of six children, was born on October 23 1906 and grew up in the suburbs of Buenos Aires in a cultured, liberal, multilingual environment.</p> <p>A particularly striking attribute of Norah Lange's was her mane of red hair, an exotic attribute in a Latin country and one associated in the Hispanic world with devilment and mischief. She grew up the tomboy of the family, notorious for her escapades and practical jokes - her favourite turn in early adolescence was to put on a poncho and a broad-brimmed hat and climb up on the roof, from where she shocked the neighbours by shouting out an incomprehensible stream of words in various languages, punctuated with insults and shrieks of laughter. Yet despite this apparently extroverted personality, Lange would remain something of an enigma to herself, and this inner mystery was to be the source of her creativity.</p> <p>Borges was extraordinarily susceptible to the romantic aura of men of action, and Lange's attachment to the memory of her father, a noted explorer who died when she was still a child, undoubtedly added to her mystique. In addition, the Langes were related to the distinguished Norwegian novelist and playwright Alexander Kielland and this meant that Norah, like Borges, could boast writers as well as heroes among her forebears. To cap it all, the two families were related by marriage, Norah's aunt being the wife of Borges's uncle Frank, a connection that made Norah and Georgie primos, or cousins, in the Hispanic tradition.</p> <p>Norah's, then, was a complex allure: her red hair spoke of passion, but her pale, Scandinavian looks called to mind the purity of an angel, and it was this tantalising blend of innocence and fire that she captured in dreamy poems charged with erotic anticipation. Her poems, moreover, depicted a landscape not dissimilar to Borges's, a favourite topic being the sun setting over the barrios bordering the pampas.</p> <p>In October 1924, at around the time Lange published La calle de la tarde, she began to invite Borges and a select group of friends every Saturday evening to a party at her house. There they would recite their work, discuss literary and other matters and dance to tangos played on the piano. These parties soon became the highlight of Lange's week: she would write that on Saturdays \"the evening is suddenly lit up\" by the presence of Georgie and his friends. And so it was, too, for Borges, for these parties would convert the house on calle Tronador into the inner sanctum of his literary group.</p> <p>In Lange, Borges believed he might have found a source of inspiration that would inject new energy into his writing. In January 1925 he published his own version of the last page of Ulysses - Molly Bloom's famous, erotic soliloquy - the first translation of James Joyce into Spanish. By the middle of the following year, Borges's relations with Norah Lange had reached an unprecedented intimacy. One of her poems of this period suggests an encounter that was as much erotic as emotional - she describes herself going to her lover like dew to a freshly opened rose; her heart aches with bliss as she anticipates the feast that awaits her in his lips; she can imagine him within her, plain as the moon in the silence of the night.</p> <p>This sense of communion in love was to exert a powerful influence on Borges's literary ideas. In June 1926 he published \"A Profession of Literary Faith\", in which he likened the transaction between an author and a reader to \"a confidence\" whose basis lay in \"the trust of the listener and the veracity of the speaker\". Writing was \"the full confession of a self, of a character, of a human adventure,\" and, correspondingly, readers had \"a lust for souls, for destinies, for idiosyncrasies\", a lust so sure of what it sought that if fictional lives did not satisfy it, it would \"lovingly probe the life of the author\". He conceded that the \"autobiographical substance\" of a work might be hidden at times under the \"accidents\" that embodied it, but it was present all the same, \"like a heart beating in the depths\". Writing was both creation and discovery, for an author remained open to a mysterious power that would reveal to him the essence of the self and its relation to the world.</p> <p>As far as Borges was concerned, the personification of that guiding power was Lange: it was she who had inspired his ultra-confessional poetics of the heart, and she who, he hoped, would bring to a harmonious fruition all the various elements that existed in contradiction and disarray in his conception of himself.</p> <p>On November 6 Borges accompanied Lange to a luncheon party at the restaurant by the Boating Lake in Palermo Park. The party was being held in honor of Ricardo G\u00fciraldes whose gaucho novel, Don Segundo Sombra, had been published to huge acclaim earlier that year. In a photograph later published in Martin Fierro, Norah Lange appears fresh-faced and dreamy, gazing upward, head to one side, as if lost in a girlish reverie; next to her is Georgie, wearing a faintly wry smile that gives him an air of relaxed, proprietorial satisfaction.</p> <p>At this time Norah Lange was known as a published poet and a literary protege of Borges, but her contact with other writers outside Borges's own circle had been very limited. It was at the party in Palermo Park that Borges introduced Lange to his chief literary rival, the poet Oliverio Girondo, and she was later to find herself sitting next to him. What struck her about Girondo was his voice - it was dark and resonant, \"like mahogany\" or something \"underground\"; at one point she knocked over a bottle of wine, whereupon Girondo leaned over and said to her, \"Blood will flow between us\". After lunch they danced together and then Girondo took her home. Lange had fallen head over heels for this stranger - \"Oliverio was vital, passionate. I was in love with him from that day on.\"</p> <p>Girondo was not handsome - he had protruding front teeth accentuated by a weak chin that he would mask in later years with a distinctive beard, but his pale complexion set off restless brown eyes; his hair was swept back from a high forehead to fall in wavy locks around his neck. He was very much a man of the world - privately educated in England and France, widely travelled, and currently resident in Paris. Oliverio liked to present himself as a rebel against the straitlaced mores of Argentine society, but he was, in fact, the scion of a powerful landowning family of Basque descent, and for all his bohemian airs he was not averse to reminding people of his kinship with the Arenales and the Uriburus, two of the most illustrious of the great criollo dynasties.</p> <p>To lose Lange to another man would have been disaster enough for Borges, but to lose her to Girondo was a desperate humiliation. His dislike of Girondo had arisen over a disagreement about the avant-garde, but there was also a marked difference in temperament - Borges was withdrawn, mild mannered, tentative; Girondo was a force of nature, brash and energetic, and a compulsive exhibitionist. Class resentment played a part, too. Though of patrician stock, Borges actually came from the urban middle class, whereas Girondo belonged to the ruling elite.</p> <p>Girondo turned up at the Lange house the following Saturday, having been invited by Norah. He was introduced to her mother Se\u00f1ora Lange, and he later claimed to have got on so well with her that they had ended up playing chess together under a table.</p> <p>Lange and Girondo began seeing each other almost every day. As she was to put it in a poem, her lover's voice promised to uncover life's possibilities for her, and as her feelings became more ardent, so did the insistent voice press her for something that she was too frightened to surrender in a society that placed such a premium on a woman's honour. But then Girondo announced that he was leaving Buenos Aires - \"He already had a ticket for Europe in his pocket\", Norah was to tell an interviewer - and on December 4, barely a month after the party at Palermo Park, he embarked for Paris, leaving Lange in a state of the most acute distress. She began writing to him almost daily, and decided to transform her letters into an epistolary novel, Voz de la vida (The Voice of Life), through which she might come to terms with her predicament.</p> <p>\"I suffered so badly my hair fell out,\" Lange recalled. \"For some time I had to wear a little bonnet to cover my head.\" Towards the end of 1927, she decided to go to Norway to spend a year with Ruthy, her sister, who was married and expecting her first child. On November 15, Martin Fierro announced a farewell party for Lange, whose Voz de la vida had just been published. Later that month she departed Buenos Aires on a cargo ship bound for Oslo.</p> <p>Borges's rejection by Norah Lange was to be one of the major reversals in his life. In March 1927, when Girondo was refusing to have anything to do with Lange, Borges had proposed marriage to her, but it seemed that the more Girondo made the girl suffer, all the more did she understand that she could not love Borges. In April she repudiated Borges's love with unexpected cruelty, publishing in Martin Fierro a review of his first two poetry collections, Fervor de Buenos Aires and Moon Across the Way, under the enigmatic title \"Thinking of Jorge Luis Borges in Something That Does Not Quite Manage to Be a Poem\". With a few well-placed qualifications, she distanced herself from the poetry of the man whom she had been happy to acknowledge as her mentor for the past three years.</p> <p>Borges's response to the critical review came just two weeks later, in the form of a brief essay on one of the greatest love poems in the Spanish language, the 21st of Francisco de Quevedo's \"Sonnets to Lisi\" in which the poet declares that his soul and veins and marrow have known the fires of love, and when he dies they will lose their form but not their will: \"Ash they shall become, but ash that shall yet feel, Dust they may be, but dust that loves you still.\"</p> <p>Quevedo's sonnet, according to Borges, was \"a most original argument for immortality\", an argument based on the proposition that \"intensity is the promise of immortality\", and not just any kind of intensity but the intensity of erotic desire. Still, his confidence in salvation had been profoundly shaken and his belief in the possibility of \"immortality\" would become ever more tenuous - in another essay written later that year he would insist that even though the particular feelings or thoughts of a writer might fade with time, his \"individuality\" would \"cling like a root\" to the souls of his readers, allowing his literary personality to survive if only as \"an echo\", \"a handful of shadows\", a mere \"wake in the absence of the word\".</p> <p>Borges had made his profession of literary faith at the very zenith of his love for Norah Lange, when it had seemed to him that the highest goal of poetry was a transparency of communication comparable to that between lovers. In the wake of his rejection, in a public lecture sponsored by the newspaper La Prensa that he gave in September 1927, he gave voice to a visceral mistrust of all language, declaring that it was the Devil - \"that mocking serpent, that inventor of equivocation and adventure, that core of the fruits of chance, that eclipse of an angel\" - who had baptised the things of this world.</p> <p>This outburst came only a few weeks after Lange had broken with him. In a poem called \"To the Doctrine of Passion in Your Voice\", addressed to an unnamed woman, he wrote: \"How to forget your voice of passion,/ when voices that once said 'I love you' have been forgotten,/ and yours holds us in thrall?\"</p> <p>And yet, despite this attitude of resignation, the poet looks toward a future in which it is conceivable that he might regain the woman's love. Borges evidently felt that all was not lost with regard to Lange: it was possible that in the year she planned to spend with her sister in Oslo she might get over her feelings for Girondo and he might then have a chance to win her back. Meanwhile, he had to face life in Buenos Aires without her - a bleak, comfortless prospect and a period in which the whole of his inner world would remain in suspense, waiting for Lange to return, waiting to discover whether he might yet find salvation as a writer or be damned forever to the nothingness of the self.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from Borges: A Life by Edwin Williamson, published by Viking, price \u00a325</p>",
  "<p><strong> Plague in Arab lands</strong></p> <p> Regarding your recent debate on the nature of the Black Death (Letters, September 4), I would suggest western historians study the Arab historians' very rational accounts of the plague that swept through the middle east on its way to Europe in 1346-7. They clearly describe both the bubonic and the pneumonic strains, together with a third (septicaemic) which produced death in a matter of hours. They did not identify the rat-flea-human transmission mechanism, but described the appearance of diseased animals, and one historian noted that the plague in Cairo was worst among the sellers of old clothes in the souk, who would of course have been very prone to flea-bites. </p> <p>Islam had a range of attitudes towards the disease: including the belief that Muslims should not flee from infection, and consequently the population of Cairo remained in the city. The death rate appears to have been about the same as in the west, where the population fled. This may be have been due to the high standards of cleanliness in Muslim cities. Also, the plague was not necessarily considered as divine punishment, but as offering a species of martyrdom for the faith, and death by the plague could be considered as death in \"jihad\", thus taking the sufferer straight to Paradise. </p> <p>The classic study of the plague in the Muslim world is The Black Death in the Middle East by Michael Dols (Princeton University Press, 1977), which would greatly assist western historians in their understanding of the disease.<br><strong> Jane Jakeman</strong></p> <p> Oxford </p> <p><strong> Freud wars</strong><br> </p> <p> The secular religion of the atheistic intellectual is beautifully demonstrated in Nicholas Lezard's review of Freud's Civilization and its Discontents , (\"Kindling the fire of knowledge\", September 4). Freud wrote the book partly as his attempt to explain the violence of the first world war which, for the first time, had engaged almost all nations of western civilisation. The Enlightenment belief in history as a record of human progress was stopped in its tracks by the terrible slaughter of that war. An atmosphere of deep intellectual pessimism prevailed in the 1920s. However, wars are not caused by civilisations lapsing into psychosis, each war has its many complex causes; but political and historical investigation no more interested Freud than did scientific analysis. </p> <p>Religions are incapable of showing intolerance; but individual Christians, Jews, Atheists, Muslims are. </p> <p>There is little scientific clarity in psychoanalysis, it is a philosophical position; and while I agree that Freud is a master essayist, he does not have Montaigne's openmindedness. Nor, apparently, do his disciples.<br><strong> Joy Neary</strong><br> by email </p> <p><strong> More Green ink, please</strong></p> <p> Ian Jack (\"Writers against... the weather\", August 28) gently mocks the idea of writers taking sides \"... on their Volvos, their second home, their EasyJet flights to Tuscany and their weekly drive to Waitrose\". But is it not time for authors to do just this - preferably in their work? The recent revival of political theatre in Britain and the US is much to be welcomed; but if such theatre remains confined to thinking about Guant\u00e1namo and Iraq, and not about global climate change and how to act locally with regard to it, it will be missing a big trick. Philosophers and literary theorists have begun to take up the challenge of addressing \"green issues\" in their work; let artists and literary authors do the same. </p> <p>And then let us all practice what we preach.</p> <p> <strong> Rupert Read </strong> (Green Party)</p> <p> Norwich </p> <p><strong> Plum and Sam</strong></p> <p> In his review of Wodehouse: A Life (\"Plum Pudding\", Septem ber 4) Nigel Williams misrepresents two powerful drives. Surely Bertie Wooster, rather than \"always chasing after some impossible girl\", was more often to be seen attempting to escape their clutches? And, as to the motive for writing, Boswell records Johnson not as speaking of \"no man but a blockhead writing for money\" but as asserting that \"No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money\" - a view more nearly akin to Wodehouse's. </p> <p>Wodehouse might also have concurred with the tone and substance of Johnson's reported observation that \"if he thought Boswell really meant to write his life he would prevent it by taking Boswell's\".<br><strong> Peter Griffith</strong><br>Droitwich </p> <p><strong> Translating Cavafy</strong></p> <p> Duncan Sprott (\"The naked civil servant\", August 14) writes of the difficulty of translating Cavafy, and, certainly, earlier translations often appear coy as well as clumsy. Readers will be interested in a new selection of Cavafy by the American poet George Economou (I've Gazed So Much, Stop Press, London, 2003). There is a freshness about these translations, and a direct confrontation with the erotic source of his inspiration which is often muted or academic in previous versions. They have echoes of Catullus and Whitman, and are complemented by the accompanying illustrations by the New York based Swiss artist, Dieter Hall. </p> <p>Comparisons with the earlier versions suggest that Cavafy has at last found a translator with a poet's courage and sense of diction.<br><strong> Malcolm Wiseman</strong><br> London </p> <p><strong> She's back</strong></p> <p> The most melancholy sentence in last week's Review was \"Posy Simmonds is away\".<br><strong> Peter Rawlings</strong><br> West Yorkshire </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send letters to Review, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. <a href=\"mailto:review@theguardian.com\">review@theguardian.com</a>.

  "I supervise undergraduates studying Chaucer and can imagine no better way of illuminating their minds to the wonder and vitality of the 14th century than by taking them into the Fitzwilliam and showing them the Macclesfield Psalter (Battle to save rare Psalter for the nation, September 9). That covers access and education; as for social inclusion, under-graduates come from all kinds of backgrounds, as do museum visitors, even in Cambridge, a fact the Heritage Lottery Fund clearly does not appreciate. <p>What kind of narrow-minded bigotry could refuse funding for such derisory reasons? The Psalter is a major part of national and East Anglian heritage, its illustrations overwhelming in their celebration of life; and, as such, its importance to art historians is obvious. </p> <p>Think of Chaucer's Reeve's Tale: northern students (complete with accents - social inclusion, 14th-century style), studying at Cambridge and taking highly non-PC revenge on an uppity and unpleasant local miller. The same sophistication and bawdry coexisting as in the pages of the Psalter. What access could any poor student have once this book is in the Getty? It belongs here, in Cambridge, in East Anglia. <br><b>Henrietta Twycross-Martin</b><br>Cambridge</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Spending \u00a310m in recreating lost churches in the sea off Dunwich (Village hearts sink at plan to raise churches, September 8) seems a wasteful idea when global warming will raise the sea level in the long run.

These structures really do have an impact on the east coast and deserve to be preserved not merely for the buildings' sake, but to commemorate the people who work in the fuel industries and who allow us a lifestyle our ancestors could never have dreamed of. </p> <p>Giving relevance to Christian roots is one thing. St Felix (d 647) might have had Dunwich (Domnoc) as his see. But on a political level, the concocting of regions for Britain is undermining real understanding and appreciation of place and history.

What is the point of these empty \"sculptures\", if there are too few people to inhabit areas that are not only beautiful, but which have the potential to create a 21st-century rural life that would lessen our dependency on oil and give back meaning to the art of living. <br><b>Cathy Raven</b><br> Cambridge </p>"
