  "<p>Today's emergency board meeting of the Football Association is unlikely to have much time for any other business. In the wake of the sexual shenanigans at Soho Square it will consider the future of Sven-Goran Eriksson, the England coach, begin the search for a new chief executive and, perhaps, discuss the position of the embarrassed FA chairman Geoff Thompson. </p> <p>That is a big enough agenda for one afternoon. So it can be presumed that the wider question, namely the point of the FA's existence, will not come up for discussion. </p> <p>Which is a pity because this is what many people who play, watch and organise English football, from the top of the Premier League to the humblest village team, must be wondering just now. A governing body that cannot keep its trousers on is hardly in a position to go on making sure that football in general continues to pull its socks up. </p> <p>Faria Alam, the woman in the case, may have given new significance to the term sweet FA but the joke has worn a bit thin. Headless and rudderless, the organisation which, for all its preponderance of buffers and duffers, at least retained a degree of dignity that the global game respected is now in danger of becoming an irrelevance. </p> <p>Well might the words of Oliver Cromwell to the Rump Parliament, echoed by LS Amery to the Chamberlain government in 1940, be repeated here: \"Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God go.\" </p> <p>It is a tempting thought but a chilling prospect. Leave the professional game in this country wholly at the mercy of the plutocrats of the Premier League, which would swiftly reduce the England team to the status of Guam? That would be throwing English football to the jackals. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the FA has been seriously weakened by an episode compared with which even the normal silly season seems a model of common sense. Mark Palios, one of its better chief executives, a sound financial administrator with football roots, has been forced to resign not so much because he dallied with the fair Faria but because of the efforts made to spare his blushes while throwing Eriksson to the News of the Screws. </p> <p>Eriksson will survive today's FA board meeting if it is convinced that he did not lie about his involvement with Alam but simply dismissed all the fuss as nonsense. Yet even if he stays, which seems increasingly likely, his position as England coach has been seriously holed, maybe not below the waterline but sufficiently close to it to require an urgent spot of bailing should the waves of World Cup qualification become choppy. </p> <p>As he prepares to announce his squads for the friendly against the Ukraine in Newcastle a week next Wednesday and next month's qualifiers in Austria and Poland, Eriksson knows, if he did not already suspect as much, that there are those on the FA board who feel he should go and would have felt the same even if his latest bit of skirt-chasing had not happened. </p> <p>Like most things in football management it is all down to results. Had Wayne Rooney not limped out of the European Championship quarter-final against Portugal just before the half-hour, had Urs Meier, the Swiss shopkeeper, not disallowed Sol Campbell's last-minute winner, had David Beckham remembered how to take penalties . . . well, Eriksson's \u00a34m-going-on-\u00a35m-a-year salary might now seem a bargain. </p> <p>As it is, those who believe that getting England to the last eight of a major tournament and coming home with a plausible hard-luck story is hardly a unique feat, let alone one worth \u00a35m a year, surely have a point. And unless the world goes flat and Brazil fall off the edge, nothing much will change in Germany in 2006. </p> <p>Yet surely little would be gained by removing Eriksson now, even if the lawyers and accountants could find a way of doing so without bankrupting the FA. That would leave England in a situation not dissimilar to the one Eriksson inherited after Kevin Keegan resigned when England lost their opening World Cup qualifier 1-0 to Germany at Wembley in 2001. Except that, thanks to their Swedish coach, the present squad is hardly in the same state of disarray. </p> <p>England managers and coaches have often borne the brunt of the public disaffection that invariably follows a disappointing European Championship. Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle were all savaged by the sports pages after their teams had flopped in the Euros, and Eriksson would anyway be in for a hard time should England falter in Vienna and Chorzow next month. </p> <p>If getting England to the next World Cup is a priority Eriksson should stay. Not that anyone will still be fooled by his air of professorial propriety. </p> <p>Like the wartime GIs, Eriksson is overpaid, oversexed and over here. In Wales he would now be known as Goran the Goat. But he has the support of the England players and that - FA board please note - is not lightly thrown away.</p>",
  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland tantalised the City yesterday by indicating it was getting closer to considering buying a major bank overseas. </p> <p>While Sir Fred Goodwin, the RBS chief executive, was careful not to be specific or suggest a deal was imminent, he did say the environment was changing. </p> <p>\"The climate in Europe has changed a little. There is a type of conversation that hasn't happened before.\" </p> <p>He said such a deal - which he used to consider \"too hard\" to do - was likely to take place in the \"middle distance\". </p> <p>Sir Fred added: \"US banks are getting bigger and bigger. You don't have to spend too much time looking in the crystal ball to think they will be turning their attention elsewhere.\" </p> <p>RBS is regarded as possible suitor for Abbey National but was careful yesterday not to answer specific questions about its intentions towards the mortgage lender, which has agreed to be bought by Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain. </p> <p>Sir George Mathewson, the chairman of RBS, sits on the Santander board and admitted for the first time yesterday that he had not attended the board meeting at which the Abbey bid was ratified. </p> <p>When asked whether he felt he could stay on the Santander board if the Abbey deal was completed, he said: \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\" </p> <p>He insisted that RBS had no role in the Santander offer for Abbey, despite a relationship that stretches back 15 years. Santander and Abbey have cross-holdings in each other and Santander has two executives on the RBS board. </p> <p>Sir George refused to predict whether the Santander offer for Abbey would go through. </p> <p>Analysts at Teather &amp; Greenwood said: \"RBS is not going to bid for Abbey because it is convinced it would not be allowed to.\" </p> <p>Abbey's shares fell 4p to 577.5p yesterday, remaining above the 555p a share at which the Santander bid values the bank. Santander is offering one of its own shares plus 31p in cash. </p> <p>RBS's shares fell 49p to \u00a315.10 on slight disappointment about its interim results which showed that pre-tax profits rose 17% to \u00a33.3bn and slight concern about its profit margins. </p> <p>Excluding goodwill amortisation and amortisation costs, the profits rose 12% to \u00a33.8bn. Its bad debt charge rose to \u00a3751m from \u00a3742m. </p> <p>The bank, which now generates more growth in profit each year than it used to generate in total before its takeover of NatWest four years ago, yesterday made another acquisition in the US. It is buying merchant acquirer Lynk Systems for $525m (\u00a3287m). </p> <p>RBS is in the process of integrating its latest acquisition Charter One, which is also expected to deter it from making any major acquisitions quickly. </p> <p>Sir Fred said the bank had embarked on a new drive to become more efficient internally. This had included saving \"18 miles of paper every night\" by only using electronic communication with branches.</p>",
  "<p>Polio is expected to be eradicated globally by the end of the year despite a recent major outbreak of the paralysing disease in Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said today.</p> <p>The WHO's claim follows the resumption of vaccination campaigns in parts of northern Nigeria, where doubts over the vaccine's safety led to the suspension of immunisation last year, and the largest polio epidemic in recent years.</p> <p>Vaccination campaigns resumed at the weekend in the Nigerian states of Kano and Kaduna, following efforts by health officials to tackle false rumours about the vaccine's safety.</p> <p>The suspension of immunisation in the two states led to polio being exported to 10 other countries in central and western Africa, bringing the total number of infected countries on the continent to 22.</p> <p>A spokesman for the WHO polio eradication programme said the recent epidemic in northern Nigeria was sparked by unfounded fears that the vaccine could affect female fertility. He said: \"Among some communities there was a rumour that the vaccine was laced with anti-fertility agents.\"</p> <p>This year Nigeria has reported 430 cases of polio, compared to just 58 across all of west and central Africa last year. Thirty of 37 states in the country are infected. </p> <p>The WHO global polio eradication initiative said the outbreak \"spread quite rampantly\" to infections in Botswana, the Sudan, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Chad, Benin, Togo, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, which were all polio-free in the previous year.</p> <p>A spokesman for the initiative said that it intends to carry out a huge synchronised national immunisation drive in all infected countries in October and November.</p> <p>But he warned that the programme faces a funding shortfall of several hundred million dollars and some of these campaigns may not be able to take place without more donations.</p> <p>Polio remains endemic in Nigeria, Niger, Egypt, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The WHO said that the governments of all these countries have reiterated their commitment to eradicate the virus by the end of the year.</p> <p>Polio was endemic in more than 125 countries when the WHO polio eradication initiative was launched in 1988.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell has removed a major obstacle to his pursuit of advertising agency Grey Global by persuading Procter &amp; Gamble, the US agency's major client to drop objections to a WPP bid for the company.</p> <p>The move will astound Publicis boss Maurice Levy, who last month ruled himself out of buying New York-based Grey reputedly because of objections from Procter &amp; Gamble - one of his key clients. The consumer goods giant was reportedly concerned that a takeover by Publicis would mean that all of its advertising around the world would be housed under one roof.</p> <p>But it is understood P&amp;G has no objections to a WPP bid despite a potential conflict of interest - Sir Martin's group is contracted to do the advertising for Unilever, P&amp;G's arch rival in the packaged household goods market.</p> <p>It is understood that Sir Martin received his assurances from Procter &amp; Gamble executives at a meeting in the US a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Sources say P&amp;G has told Sir Martin they do not believe a conflict of interest with Unilever would arise, as long as it had guarantees that Grey remained a separate operation.</p> <p>WPP refused to comment, referring all inquiries on the matter to Procter &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for P&amp;G at its global headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio said the company would not comment on the sale until Grey had issued further statements.</p> <p>If Grey's other clients take the same attitude as P&amp;G, the only obstacle to WPP buying the company will be the price it can agree with Ed Meyer, the 77-year-old chairman of Grey.</p> <p>Mr Meyer is in line for a \u00a318.6m cash payout if the sale goes through, the Times reported today.</p> <p>Some analysts believe Mr Meyer may not sell at all because he failed to attract as much interest in the company as he had first hoped.</p> <p>In the past major advertisers such as P&amp;G have refused the advertising agencies they use from doing business with companies that sell rival products, but in the past couple of years they have raised fewer objections to holding companies owning different advertising agency networks that service rival companies.</p> <p>Earlier this week Sir Martin confirmed he had \"discussed conflicts of interests\" with his major clients and had been told \"as long we keep it separate, it's fine\" - but he refused to elaborate any further.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch said today that if WPP's rival for the sale, French advertising group Havas, bought Grey it would be a good strategic fit - but a \"high financial risk\" for the company. Havas, the sixth largest advertising group in the world, has teamed up with US investment firm Quadrangle to bid for Grey.</p> <p>Analysts at Merrill Lynch released a report noting that Grey's margin, a measure of profitability, last year was 7.1%, while Havas's margin was 8.3% and WPP's 13%.</p> <p>\"We believe WPP's cost cutting experience and infrastructure implies less execution risk and financials are healthier,\" said the report, which noted that there was \"less strategic rationale\" for a WPP acquisition.</p> <p>It said that the companies could justify buying Grey if they could raise its margins to 13%.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Daniel Libeskind is in his studio in Zurich, having flown in from New York for a day and night. He is unsure what day it is, and when we pop back to his office after a coffee, he forgets what floor his studio is on. It's a bit like being on screen with Woody Allen. </p> <p>Aside from the Zurich studio, Libeskind has offices in New York and Hong Kong. His career is clearly on some global trajectory. As well as the master-planning of Ground Zero in New York, he has new commissions for important building projects in Milan, Seoul and Hong Kong. He is busy building in Denver, San Francisco, Bern and Tel Aviv. He has just completed a boat-like and uncharacteristically low-profile Jewish Museum in Copenhagen. In the Zurich studio, he shows me a model of a military museum planned for the centre of born-again Dresden. We get to talk (Libeskind in his inimitable thousand-words-a-minute way) in-between client meetings. </p> <p>Libeskind's ability to concentrate intensely on one project for the time needed before switching to the next with equal enthusiasm is remarkable. Here is a successful architect firing on all cylinders, and very much on form. </p> <p>Not that you would have gleaned this from newspapers over the past fortnight. Instead, you will have read that the government turned down a funding application from the Victoria and Albert Museum to build his Spiral Gallery, dedicated to contemporary design. And you will have learned that there is trouble in New York, too. The architect's design for the 1,776ft Freedom Tower at Ground Zero has been taken over by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), successful commercial architects. Now Studio Libeskind is suing the developer, Larry Silverstein. Is the sky-rocketing Libeskind falling to earth, his dramatic, zig-zag designs in tow? \"You've got to have faith,\" he says. \"And patience, too. Lots of it. </p> <p>\"When you're a kid with artistic yearnings brought up in the Bronx, you don't get fed up too easily. It took 10 years to build the Jewish Museum in Berlin [his first building; overall, a critical success]. Nearly everybody said it would never happen. It was too crazy, too unrealistic. But it did happen. And now we've been asked to build an extension to the museum because the number of visitors is growing each year. </p> <p>\"The Spiral Gallery may happen, too. It is not dependent on government funding. The museum has raised many millions of pounds, and a benefactor might still come its way. We've revised the project to bring it up to date. There is a possibility it will happen, and there is the possibility it might not, but you have to believe in what might be. I'm not Candide, nor Dr Pangloss, but we know that faith moves mountains.\" </p> <p>And raises Manhattan towers? Libeskind proves keen to emphasise the positive here, too. \"SOM has taken over the design of the Freedom Tower, but we're in charge of the overall masterplan for Ground Zero. This includes the tower, but far more besides. We're dealing, simultaneously, with the commissioning and construction of 10 million sq ft of offices, the 9/11 memorial, entire new streets, a new park, seven storeys of infrastructure below ground, transportation, security ... It's like running a marathon several times over. I don't get to sleep when I'm in New York. Really. I'm living on adrenaline.\" He must be. It's getting on for two o'clock and he clearly hasn't had a chance to even think about lunch. </p> <p>\"This is a huge project,\" he continues, \"the rebirth, effectively, of Lower Manhattan. It involves so many players and will take several years to complete. We're in this for the long run. Our office is on Rector Street with a great view of Ground Zero, Federal Hall, the Hudson and the Statue of Liberty. Every time I look out of the window, I'm reminded of what I'm doing.\" </p> <p>So what is the problem between Libeskind and Silverstein, the Mr Big of New York's property world and lessee, from the Port Authority, of the World Trade Centre site? \"It's a straightforward legal issue,\" says Libeskind. \"Larry wanted us to reposition the tower. We wouldn't, and won't. He's been holding back our fees. We want to get paid. And that's it. It'll get solved and we'll carry on with planning Ground Zero.\" </p> <p>Planning, but not building. Libeskind admits: \"It's been hard to hand over the working design of Freedom Tower to another architect - although we're still a part of the team, and so is Larry. And, yes, I love the process of building. But maybe it's good for architects to have their egos kept in check once in a while. Anyway, we're building so much around the world, I can hardly complain.\" </p> <p>New York, though, is a very special case, and place, for Libeskind. This is where he came, by ship, aged 13, with his family from Lodz in Poland in 1959. The sight, and promises, of the Statue of Liberty, the experience of immigration procedures on Ellis Island, and the sheer drama of the anyone-can-make-it-here city, made indelible impressions on the budding architect. He is an American citizen, and proud of it. His twisting design for the Freedom Tower is a play on the stance of the nearby Statue of Liberty. He finds nothing corny in designing a building 1,776ft tall, nor in the decision to lay the foundation stone on July 4. </p> <p>\"Right now, the rest of the world confuses American notions of patriotism and nationhood with the actions of a specific administration,\" he argues. \"But the US is a democracy, and when a government is voted out, these humanist notions of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness continue.\" </p> <p>Libeskind still recalls the construction of the World Trade Centre in the late 1960s and early 1970s; at the time he was a student at the Cooper Union school of architecture in New York. \"I remember vividly the huge holes in the ground excavated for their foundations. Yamasaki's towers were exciting in terms of their sheer scale and daring, but they were never my favourite buildings. Most people only really expressed a fondness for them after their destruction. I found them pretty frightening, and the whole area around them a case of the classic windswept plaza. </p> <p>\"Now, for the worst of reasons, we have a chance to make this area really special - and this is happening even before any of us gets to build. There are more people living in Lower Manhattan now than before the terrorist attacks. That's faith for you. There's such a strong spirit here.\" </p> <p>So strong, in fact, that everyone seemed to have a view on how to redevelop the site. One difficulty for the architect has been the number of people who have a say in the redevelopment - \"everyone from federal, state and city governments to those who live and work here. Remember,\" he says, \"it was the people of New York who rejected the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's plan for the site. They said we want something incredible, not just more real estate.\" </p> <p>And of course, fascination with the site wasn't limited to the US. Libeskind points out that in the final two weeks of the competition to find a master-planner for Ground Zero, the official website had eight million hits. \"The level of global interest was amazing. But the press reported the story in a way that was all about the egos of duelling architects. And we were all caught up in the act. We had to address huge audiences through the media and on public stages. The press were writing about our clothes, our haircuts and glasses. It was nerve-wracking. </p> <p>\"Perhaps we were over-sensitive to criticism and maybe everyone got a little too hot under the collar. Now it has settled down. We have some great architects collaborating with us today, like Santiago Calatrava, who's designing the new subway station and interchange. You'll be able to see right up from the platforms several stories below pavement level to the 9/11 memorial, to the 70-storey Freedom Tower and to the sky above.\" </p> <p>The more Libeskind talks, the more keen he seems to deflect attention from the Freedom Tower. \"The foreign press seems obsessed with the Freedom Tower, as if it was the only thing going on here. In fact, we're trying to keep a huge juggling act in balance, with the tower as just one of the many balls in play. There will be several new cultural buildings here; sure, it would be great if we could design one of them. I remain optimistic. </p> <p>\"I'm also positive we'll end up with a part of New York that is very different to, for example, the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. That was crazy. Really good architects, like Renzo Piano, Jos\u00e9 Rafael Moneo and Arata Isozaki, were working there, yet you ended up with a cultural and commercial dead-end. The plan for Lower Manhattan is very different; it's very much a part of the old city, a new and exciting part, but it will have the spirit of New York written all over it. </p> <p>\"In the process,\" Libeskind concludes as the Dresden party arrives, \"you have to be prepared to be beaten up a little. But, this shouldn't shake your faith. And, even then, you can always punch back.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cable giant NTL has announced an upbeat second quarter, showing customers and revenues on an uphill trajectory. </p> <p>It unveiled a new target of winning 4 million customers by 2008, fuelling speculation that if it merges with Telewest it could become a formidable rival to BSkyB.</p> <p>In its fourth consecutive quarter of subscriber growth, its NTL Home service exceeded expectations - the cable company notched up 60,500 new signings, well above the 50,000 it needs if it is to hit its target.</p> <p>The latest subscriber number put NTL within reach of Sky growth rates - today the latter announced it had signed up 81,000 in the same quarter. </p> <p>NTL's chief executive, Simon Duffy, said that Sky's bullish 10 million subscriber target by the end of the decade showed there was still plenty of potential for growth in pay-TV - one of the cable outfit's key revenue generating services along with telephony and broadband internet. </p> <p>\"Assuming Sky is correct then that's good news for us as well. I don't think that the competitive environment in pay-TV has got tougher,\" he said. </p> <p>NTL, which currently has 3 million subscribers - 2 million of them signing up for its pay-TV service - aims to add another 1 million by 2008. </p> <p>But Mr Duffy refused to be drawn on any potential merger with Telewest. </p> <p>Analysts agree that NTL's only option to rival Sky's digital satellite pay-TV platform is to join forces with its cable rival to cut costs and increase profitability. NTL and Telewest are being urged by shareholders to kick off merger negotiations which will see the debt-laden cable industry join forces in a \u00a37bn union. </p> <p>But NTL's negotiations with Sky over the prices the satellite broadcaster charges for channels remain unresolved. Mr Duffy said that NTL was still unhappy with its margins for Sky's premium packages. When customers switch from NTL basic to premium Sky packages the cable outfit does not make money. </p> <p>NTL is to ramp up the prices of its TV packages by \u00a31 next month in a bid to boost revenues but cut the cost of telephone and broadband packages because of the intensity of competition from BT and others.</p> <p>This quarter the cable outfit's revenues were up 6% to \u00a3584.4m. The revenue increase was mainly due to the net addition of 324,500 broadband customers and 139,800 telephony customers. Overall the company recorded a second quarter operating loss of \u00a37m. </p> <p>The cable outfit also revealed that it has increased the number of \"triple play\" customers who take TV, telephony and broadband to 22%. </p> <p>Mr Duffy said: \"NTL continues to achieve substantial progress on its stated objectives of increased market penetration, revenue growth, margin expansion and cash flow.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Heartening though it is to see American pundits and public alike gradually, grudgingly warming to the marvellous Teresa \"Shove it\" Heinz Kerry, it's even more gratifying to note that for once the land of the free is merely following where Britain has led, rather than the other way round. For here, the battleaxe has long been a cherished, almost revered figure, and is currently undergoing something of a renaissance. </p> <p>I grew up surrounded by them. Multitudinous aunts of northern extraction, zaftig dimensions (it wasn't until I hit puberty that I realised that brassieres didn't have to be made by Govan steelworkers) and indomitable will have swept, stately as galleons, through my life. They quelled infantile riots, dispensed orders, enforced discipline and clouted you into the middle of next week if you disagreed with them. They thought Coronation Street was a documentary and traced their ancestral line from Ena Sharples, through Rita Fairclough and Vera Duckworth and were last heard - over the rustle of HRT patches and dry crunching of osteoporosis - debating whether Fizz, Tracy Barlow or Karen MacDonald should inherit the crown. </p> <p>The newer breed of battleaxe, however, has moved beyond domestic confines. Modern specimens have cannily extended their sphere of influence by infiltrating the television schedules instead. Battleaxedom is a state of mind, comprising a substantial measure of misanthropy, impregnable self-confidence and a deeply rooted desire to remake the world in accordance with your own personal convictions, so it is no surprise that the current crop tend to be found firmly embedded in makeover programmes. </p> <p>Kim Woodburn, the buxom half of the How Clean Is Your House duo, is undoubtedly the leader in the field. The ring of steely contempt beneath her \"Do you see what a difference a spot of elbow grease makes, lovey?\" can, in the best tradition of the battleaxe regiment, transform even the most encouraging words into a damning indictment of her fellow man's inability to adhere to civilised standards of behaviour. </p> <p>Naomi Cleaver from Honey, I Ruined the House flies the flag atop her ability to walk into someone's home, strip it of every vestige of the occupant's presence, replace it with her own vision of what is right and proper - and still convince the victims that she's done them a favour. Most recently, there's Supernanny's Jo Frost, who looks on with appalled fascination as semi-feral children run rings around their lily-livered parents, before taking 10 minutes out of her day to transform the errant anklebiters into paragons of virtue. </p> <p>Why this proliferation on screen of battleaxe women? Perhaps because there's something undeniably exhilarating about watching people who deal only in absolutes, and are untouched by the doubts and questions that plague the rest of us. They steam implacably ahead while the rest of us flail about in a sea of moral relativism and get nothing but mental cramp for our trouble. </p> <p>And I suspect that while our other public figures fight to abdicate as much responsibility for their foul-ups as possible, while politicians gyre and gimble like the slithy toves they are, our appetite for these benignly authoritarian figures on screen will increase. </p> <p>In the meantime, the battleaxe (and I hope it's clear by now that I do not use the term pejoratively) in private life is becoming a rare thing. It may be because the advent of sexual parity and greater opportunities for women have dissipated the frustrations that once fuelled their domestic tyranny. Maybe it's due to the appearance of New Men and contraception - it's hard to hone the necessary skills on just one or two offspring and a husband who wants to help rather than hinder. It may be for the same reasons that it's so hard to find a bona-fide bitch these days. Women are too frightened of not being liked. The gains we've made, the rights we've won are too recent, too insecurely held for us to jeopardise it all by not looking deliriously happy the whole time at our good fortune. </p> <p>Whatever the reason, I hope that the fact that on-screen battleaxes are in the ascendant is a harbinger of an imminent private resurgence. I don't want my future children growing up without knowing the power of an unsmiling nod of approval, the inimitable sting of a clip round the ear or the best way to blacklead a stove. And I can't do it all myself.</p>",
  "Fire-breathing dragons and deadly scorpions may seem strange subjects for prison art. Perhaps less so given their role in an innovative project involving tattoos. <p>A \u00a36,000 grant from the Koestler Award Trust, which provides art and craft courses in prisons, young offender institutions and psychiatric hospitals, has enabled artists Moira McCarthy and Gino Ballantyne to produce tattoo-inspired art in partnership with prisoners at Wormwood Scrubs.</p> <p>\"Tattoos are cool, and they appeal to both sexes,\" explains McCarthy. \"They're also part of the culture of being an outsider.\" Using a mixture of textile dyes, acrylic paint and felt-tip pens, the prisoners created the images on large canvasses, which are displayed along the prison wings. They make the Scrubs seem more like a fashionable warehouse gallery than a secure facility.</p> <p>The aim of the five-week project was to brighten up the environment, using a subject that both officers and prisoners could relate to. It was targeted particularly at inmates felt to be excluded or marginalised, often with little access to education or with a learning disability. Of the 14 who enrolled, 10 completed the project.</p> <p>Angela Herbert, head of learning and skills at the prison, was convinced of the project's potential benefits. \"Art is a catalyst, and it has enabled the prisoners to develop self-esteem and take pride in their achievements, in what is essentially a 'negative' environment,\" she says. \"It has also been good for the prison officers to get involved. It has been an integrating experience all round.\"</p> <p>Trevor Russell, who produced a dragon banner, says: \"It's the best thing I've ever done.\" Other prisoners were similarly enthused. McDowell Morris says: \"I've never done anything like this. Moira really inspired me, and helped me to continue. I love it. It has increased my confidence and concentration.\" Chris Schautsen adds: \"I've enjoyed the interaction with people who know about art and could teach us about new materials. I could focus on the picture and lose myself. It's very liberating.\"</p> <p>However, the prisoners' attitude at the start of the project was very different, recalls McCarthy. \"They started out angry and cynical,\" she says. \"But as we progressed, they could see we were professionals who took what they were doing seriously, and communication skills and mutual respect developed.\"</p> <p>The artists hope to roll out the project to other prisons across the country. But in common with most worthy causes, funding is a problem.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> The banners will be on public display at Wormwood Scrubs on October 19.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Email <a href=\"mailto:salmon@koestler.freeserve.co.uk\">salmon@koestler.freeserve.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Mont Blanc may still be Europe's highest mountain, but it is not quite as high as it was last year. </p> <p>Glaciologists say the dimensions of the mountain, drilled into French schoolchildren, have shrunk: 50cm have gone over the year, making it 4,807.5m (15,772ft) high. More frustrating still, particularly for expeditions, there is uncertainty about where the precise summit now lies, and a serious risk that the recognised peak may be soon be overshadowed by a second, rockier tip 500m to the west.</p> <p>If you judge according to the rock formation, this western tip is the tallest point at 4,792m, with a snowy precipice a further 14m on top. The traditional summit can only claim to be the highest point if its 27.5m of ice is taken in to account.</p> <p>Much to the irritation of geography book editors, the mountain's height is constantly fluctuating. In 1894 it was deemed to be 4,807m. By 1986 it had gained another metre, by 2001 it had crept up to 4,810.4m.</p> <p>The recent shrinking has as much to do with gusts which have blown away the snow on the tip as with global warming, according to French scientists investigating climate change through ice samples on the mountain.</p> <p>Even last year's heatwave is thought to have melted only a few centimetres off the summit.

  "Think pink, or purple, or starfish-shaped: the time has come for anyone with dreams of building a truly radical country house. Forget classical columns and a nice gravelled drive: something spangly and blobby like the Selfridges building in Birmingham, something jaunty like Will Alsop's Peckham Library, or even something shiny and silvery like Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim is more likely to win planning permission. <p>The government yesterday announced the drastic tightening up of a planning guideline intended to promote \"exceptional quality\", but which has been blamed for scattering the countryside with neo-Georgian monstrosities. The measure is not being entirely scrapped, as many architects had feared. The revised guideline says new buildings will be allowed in the countryside if they are \"truly outstanding and groundbreaking\" in design and construction. </p> <p>The news was greeted with relief by architects, who may earn most of their livings from office blocks and attic conversions, but whose dream client has an untrammelled imagination, rolling acres, infinitely deep pockets and a sympathetic planning authority. </p> <p>The Royal Institute of British Architects, which was expecting the measure to be abolished, was delighted. George Ferguson, the president of Riba, welcomed \"a brave and vital endorsement by government of the value of excellence in design\". Although better known as a champion of urban development - he has backed a movement dubbed New Urbanism - he said the country house was one of Britain's most significant architectural traditions. \"The country house has through the ages been one of the defining elements of our architectural and social history,\" he said. \"It has embraced all styles and types, and should continue to be characterised by its excellence rather than an adherence to any one architectural movement.\" </p> <p>Lord Foster, whose curvaceous \"Erotic Gherkin\" now dominates the London skyline, and who recently created the even blobbier Chesa Futura, a cheese football-shaped apartment complex on the slopes above St Moritz, said: \"It is wonderful news that the government has recognised the role that good design can play in shaping the way we build in the countryside. This is a very progressive initiative.\" </p> <p>The government's announcement may mean curtains for fibreglass corinthian columns, however. The planning measure, introduced by former environment secretary John Gummer in 1997, and nicknamed \"Gummer's Law\", rapidly became seen as a developer's greenfield charter. It was always intended to confine permission for new country houses to applications of \"exceptional quality\", but resulted in a rash of buildings more like sets for Footballers' Wives. </p> <p>Landowners including Owen Inskip, whose 18th century-style mansion is now rising in the Cotswolds, or the many clients eager for neo-classical houses by Robert Adam, succeeded in convincing some local authorities that traditional brick and stone construction, tiled roofs, pillared porches, and sash windows constituted \"exceptional quality\". </p> <p>The latest modern country house to be granted planning permission, St John's House in Oxfordshire, is determinedly and unusually modern, designed by Adrian James with curved ground floor openings which reminded some of the hobbits' houses in The Lord of the Rings. </p> <p>But most successful applications have been far more traditional. The first completed under Gummer's Law was Wootton Hall in Staffordshire, a 12,000sq ft mansion designed by Digby Harris for the brewery heir John Greenall, which includes a dome, neo-Palladian ground floor, raised terrace, and a curved colonnade which would not disgrace a Regency terrace in Cheltenham. </p> <p>Viscount Rothermere, of the newspaper dynasty, has just moved into a \u00a340m resolutely traditional house by Quinlan Terry in Dorset, and millionaire Wafic Said's new home in Oxfordshire incorporates a portico with six-metre (20ft) pillars. The largest house under construction in Britain, Hamilton Palace in Sussex, was still only half built when its controversial owner, the property developer Nicholas van Hoogstraten, was jailed. He originally sketched out the design for it himself on a paper napkin, based on a combination of Versailles and Buckingham Palace. Mr Hoogstraten's conviction for manslaughter was quashed in December 2003, but it is uncertain whether the house will ever be finished: if it is, he intends it to incorporate his own mausoleum. </p> <p>The revised planning provision demands \"the highest standards of architecture... significant enhancement of its immediate setting, and sensitivity to the defining characteristics of the local area\". The planning minister, Keith Hill, is also keen to encourage experimental building, including prefabricated pods. </p> <p>Since the V&amp;A is unlikely ever to afford to build Daniel Libeskind's Spiral as a museum extension, and Will Alsop's blob-shaped \"Fourth Grace\" has just been turned down for Liverpool's waterfront, perhaps both could be recycled as country houses: plenty of room for the labradors, and no need to worry about muddy wellies.</p>",
  "<p>Growth in Britain's services sector slowed for the third month running, a key survey showed today.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply index, which measures activity in the sector that accounts for around two thirds of the economy, fell to 56.2 in July, from 56.8 in June. Economists had expected a reading of 56.5. A reading above the 50 mark signifies expansion. </p> <p>Despite the slowdown in growth, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee is still expected to raise interest rates tomorrow, its fifth increase since last November. </p> <p>All but one of the 45 economists surveyed by Reuters last week said the MPC will increase rates by 25 basis points, after keeping them on hold last month at 4.5%. </p> <p>\"The survey reinforces our belief that the Bank of England will raise interest rates by 25 basis points tomorrow, rather than by 50. However, we expect the minutes of the MPC meeting to pave the way for another 25 basis point hike as soon as September, unless there is clear evidence over the next month of a slowdown in consumer spending and borrowing, and in housing market activity,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>In its monthly survey on house prices, the Halifax bank today reported that property prices rose by 1.3% in July, bringing the value of the average property to \u00a3161,831.</p> <p>Martin Ellis, chief economist at Halifax, said: \"The house price gains in June and July [an increase of 1.2%] represent a clear step down from the 2% plus monthly price growth seen, on average, in the preceding six months. These figures, along with other housing indicators, suggest that the market may be slowing.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, Halifax said that house prices had increased by more than 22% over the past 12 months and that property values had doubled over the past five years. </p> <p>Rising house prices have been an area of major concern for the Bank of England, which is relying on a policy of gradual interest rate rises to take the property market off the boil.</p> <p>In today's survey on the service sector, the sharpest increases in business activity were recorded by hotels and restaurants, boosted by the holiday season, transport companies and business-to-business services firms. </p> <p>Service providers reported an increase in new business in July, boosted by the strong economy and a high degree of business confidence, although the rise was less pronounced than in the previous month. </p> <p>Companies said it had become harder to secure new business in certain markets, as competition was strong and consumer spending was also being tempered by higher interest rates. The new business index fell to 56.5, its lowest level since July 2003, from 57.1 in June. </p> <p>On Monday a CIPS survey on manufacturing showed the sector expanding at its fastest rate in 10 years.</p>",
  "<p>Green goddesses may appear on the streets again soon as the army is placed on standby in case firefighters go on strike.</p> <p>Government sources said the armed forces were expected to be told later today to prepare for walkouts by firefighters, which could happen as soon as next month. </p> <p>Balloting will begin next week after efforts to end a long-running pay dispute with local authority employers ended without agreement. </p> <p>It had been hoped that the two sides would sign a proposal to pay the final two stages of the deal, which ended the bitter strikes of 2002 and 2003. </p> <p>Firefighters would have received a 3.5% pay rise outstanding since last November and a second 4.2% rise, which was due to be enforced on July 1 dependent on changes to modernise the service. </p> <p>Both parties later blamed each other for the breakdown of talks, with the Fire Brigades Union responding with plans for a national strike ballot. </p> <p>During the last firefighters' strike, about 19,000 troops were used to provide emergency cover and it is believed it will take around eight weeks to make arrangements for any new walkout. </p> <p>FBU assistant general secretary, Mike Fordham, claimed some on the employers' side had acknowledged the pay deal had been deliberately scuppered. </p> <p>The union also hinted that the local government minister, Nick Raynsford, had put pressure on councillors not to agree to demands from firefighters. </p> <p>But Sir Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, the Local Government Association chairman, denied claims of a \"wrecking\" pact. </p> <p>He said: \"The reason we couldn't reach a deal with the FBU was simply down to the sticking point of bank holiday working. </p> <p>\"In return for double time and a day off in lieu, we expect firefighters to work normally on public holidays. It is as simple as that.\"</p>",
  "<p>A sodden occasion this may have been but Manchester United did enough to have opponents from Romania and Slovakia casting anxious glances towards next week's Champions League qualifier. Sir Alex Ferguson's side are purring into form and fitness; Dinamo Bucharest and Zilina have reason to be nervous. </p> <p>This was never more than a pedestrian fixture to ease United into the four-team tournament but there were still distinct signs of promise. Ruud van Nistelrooy and Louis Saha had their first football of pre-season and Alan Smith enjoyed an enthusiastic home debut. \"We were a bit short in terms of sharpness and penetration, but it's coming,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. \"It was important they got this under their belts and it'll bring them along to the level we'll need them to be next Wednesday.\" </p> <p>News of Paul Scholes's international retirement was filtering through the drenched arena as the fans watched Boca Juniors trounce the Japanese Urawa Red Diamonds 5-2 in the opening fixture. The home partisans among a crowd of 29,479 were disappointed that the midfielder was rested, however, confined to the directors' box flanked by Rio Ferdinand and Tim Howard. </p> <p>Scholes's pre-season has amounted to an hour against Milan in New Jersey but he will play against Red Diamonds tomorrow. In his absence United emerged intact from the scrappy opening exchanges despite attempts from Theo Lucius and John de Jong, for Mika\u00ebl Silvestre to leap gracefully and flick in Ryan Giggs's corner midway through the half. The lead sparked United, Chris Eagles busy in midfield with Saha and Diego Forl\u00e1n buzzing off Van Nistelrooy. </p> <p>The Uruguayan's presence was something of a surprise if only because the sporting director of the newly promoted Primera Division club Levante claimed yesterday that he was close to securing Forl\u00e1n on a season-long loan, with talks apparently scheduled with the player's agent today. \"We have already had the green light from Manchester United,\" Manuel Salvador reportedly said. \"Now we must agree terms with the player, and that is never easy.\" </p> <p>United were quick to stress that no deal was in place, and they will seek a fee for the striker. \"I'm sure they do want him on loan, but they won't be getting him,\" added Ferguson, who suggested the quartet of strikers on display here had left him \"plenty of options\" for the season ahead. </p> <p>That will encourage Forl\u00e1n, who forced Heurelho Gomes to tip a toe-poked attempt aside, the PSV goalkeeper doing even better to turn away Saha's fizzing 20-yard drive just before the interval. </p> <p>Smith was introduced at half-time and might have scored with his first touch but collided with Saha as he attempted an extravagant scissors-kick. The former Leeds striker was as spiky as ever, launching himself into challenges, though his side might have surrendered their advantage had Ricardo not turned aside Otman Bakkal's crunched near-post shot. </p> <p>The Spanish goalkeeper was helpless when Alex thumped a blistering free-kick on to the underside of the bar from 30 yards, however, but United escaped. Next week's Champions League opponents may not be so fortunate. </p> <p> <strong> Manchester United</strong> (4-3-2-1): Ricardo; G Neville, Brown (Richardson, 74), Silvestre, O'Shea; Eagles, P Neville, Giggs (Bellion, 82); Forl\u00e1n, Saha (Djemba-Djemba, h-t); Van Nistelrooy (Smith, h-t). <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Carroll, Spector, Bardsley. </p> <p><strong> PSV</strong> (4-2-3-1): Gomes; Colin (Lamey, 66), Ooijer (Alex, h-t), Bouma (Smit, 78), Bogelund; De Jong, Lucius; Bakkal (Vonlanthen, 66), Feher (Takak, 55), Beasley; Sibon (Vennegoor of Hesselink, h-t). <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Zoetebier. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> M Messias.</p>",
  "<p>Biology teaching is badly out of balance, with students spending too much time in the lab and not enough in the field, according to a report published by two respected charities.</p> <p>The shift towards laboratory-based cellular biology as opposed to the teaching of skills and techniques in practical situations has become so pronounced over the last two decades that the subject is very different to the biology that was taught in the 1980s, according to the Field Studies Council (FSC) and the British Ecological Society (BES).</p> <p>The May report, Creating the right balance, is the result of a workshop held in October last year which was attended by members of the awarding bodies, sixth form teachers, teacher trainers and representatives of learned societies and fieldwork providers. It comprises one of the most comprehensive reviews of biology teaching for 16-19 year olds and included proposals agreed by examiners and moderators from the major awarding bodies. </p> <p>The report argued that biology is becoming increasingly lopsided towards \"chalk and talk\", and expressed concern that schools and colleges are taking the easy option rather than promoting off-timetable activities, which can be vital to show students the implications of their work.</p> <p>\"Within biology, over the last 20 years or so, there's been a shift towards cell biology, so there's a concern that whole-organism biology has suffered as a result,\" said Steve Tilling, director of communications for the FSC. \"If there is this over-emphasis on cellular biology, many would question whether that's really teaching biology.\"</p> <p>The report emphasised the importance of fieldwork for familiarising students with the messy, \"real\" world, where they can appreciate the relevance of scientific method to an environment very different from the controlled, school science lab. </p> <p>\"Fieldwork will help students to... understand that books do not have all the answers\", and that \"bunnies aren't people\", stated the report, in response to the excessive degree of anthropomorphism which is characteristic of some students' work.</p> <p>Tilling agreed: \"Fieldwork helps people to understand why scientists can't always say things definitely will or will not happen.\" </p> <p>David Slingsby, chair of education, training and careers committee of the BES, emphasised the importance of fieldwork to the study of ecology:</p> <p>\"Ecology taught in the field provides outstanding opportunities for good practice in science teaching and for genuinely investigative, creative and open-ended course work.\"</p> <p>Mr Tilling added: \"Geography is the only subject where there's a statutory requirement for students to do fieldwork. If you ask a geography teacher why they teach fieldwork, they think it's part of the ethos of the subject... it should be the same for biology.</p> <p>\"The feeling is that fieldwork, especially ecology, has a strength that will bring together all elements of biology. But that can be lost if there's just an emphasis on skills and techniques... and students will also question why it's important, because they can't see the links themselves.\"</p> <p>The two bodies are hoping that more imaginative resources can be developed if schools can be persuaded to integrate fieldwork into the curriculum.</p> <p>\"One [way] is to develop materials which make a more intimate link with the students themselves, and [another] is to think more imaginatively about how students can be assessed in the field,\" said Mr Tilling.</p>",
  "On Friday, the people of Hiroshima will come together to remember the morning of August 6th 1945, when their city became the target of the first atomic bomb unleashed on a civilian population. <p>Gathering within sight of the burned out shell of the former industrial promotion hall near the epicentre of the blast, they will remember the 200,000 people who perished in the immediate aftermath or who died later from the effects of exposure to radiation.</p> <p>Remembering the A-bomb, though, is becoming an increasingly local affair. Representatives of just two of the world's seven acknowledged nuclear powers - Pakistan and Russia - will attend.</p> <p>Almost six decades after the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, collective horror at their consequences is being replaced by collective amnesia. And to forget, say those who survived, is to invite the prospect of a disastrous repeat of the radioactive infernos of the summer of 1945.</p> <p>The hibakusha - the Japanese name for those who survived the bombings - are falling victim to the passage of time and shifts in the geopolitical environment that are concentrating minds on terrorism and regime change at the expense of more traditional threats, such as nuclear war.</p> <p>In Japan itself, the anti-nuclear movement has been marginalised. What was once a mass movement - a largely silent but powerful majority committed to upholding the country's pacifist constitution and non-nuclear principles - has become too closely associated with the impotent political parties of the far left.</p> <p>To many, the rallying cry of \"No More Hiroshimas!\" sounds cloying and hopelessly out of date.</p> <p>It is little wonder, then, that the voices of the hibakusha are being drowned out amid the din of real politik, especially in a region that is coming to terms with a North Korea emboldened by a nuclear weapons programme.</p> <p>Inevitably, age, too, is an obstacle. Most of the survivors are in their 70s, 80s and 90s. Many are in poor health.</p> <p>Yet they are determined not to be written off as mere unfortunates in a singularly tragic event. They still have battles to be won - for recognition and to secure their rightful place in history, lest, they say, it be repeated.</p> <p>\"They are not forgotten, but they have been forced to exist in a historical file labelled 'A-Bomb',\" said Kazumi Mizumoto, an associate professor at the Hiroshima Peace Institute.</p> <p>\"At the same time, they are the only people to have experienced the effects of the military use of nuclear bombs. Whenever the world faces the danger of nuclear weapons, they alone can tell the world what the result will be. In that sense they are still important, and I think the world understands that.\"</p> <p>The community of atomic bomb survivors is now a diaspora spread between Japan, North and South Korea, China, the United States and Brazil - separated geographically, but united in their experience of coming under nuclear attack and by fear that many are not getting the official assistance that they deserve in their old age.</p> <p>The subjects of numerous books, magazines and recordings, their recollections will survive long after they are gone.</p> <p>In one of the biggest such projects, conducted just over 40 years after the attacks, NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, and the Hiroshima Peace Cultural Centre, asked 100 survivors to talk about the day their world fell apart.</p> <p>Among them was Toshiko Saeki, a 26-year-old-woman who rushed to Hiroshima from her home in the suburbs on the afternoon of August 6 1945 to search for her mother and other family members.</p> <p>Saeki, who lost 13 relatives in the attack, made perhaps the most eloquent case for not allowing the voices of the A-bomb survivors like her to fade into obscurity.</p> <p>\"Our experience must not be forgotten,\" she said. \"What we believed in during the war turned out to be worth nothing. I went through hell on earth [so that] Hiroshima should not be repeated again. That is why I keep telling the same old story over and over again. And I'll keep on repeating it.\"</p> <p>Hers is just one of countless similar experiences that Mizumoto believes will remind the region and the world of what they stand to lose should they ever be pushed to the brink of nuclear war. Simply rationalising the political consequences, he says, is not enough.</p> <p>\"People are often motivated more by emotion than by logical discussion,\" he said. \"That is where the meaning behind Hiroshima and Nagasaki plays a part, and will continue to play a part.\"</p>",

  "The high-riding Liberal Democrats are set to be shaken by a controversial call from the party's young Turks to adopt new \"tough liberal\" policies which are pro-market and more Eurosceptic and place new responsibilities on persistent offenders. <p>The proposals include a social insurance system in health, reining back the regulatory state and greater use of market forces to address the global environmental crisis. </p> <p>The highly liberal prescriptions, in a book written by party frontbenchers, will be controversial among the Liberal Democrats, enjoying their best persistent showing in the polls for decades. </p> <p>They also reflect concern that the party is becoming a \"one instrument orchestra\", attacking the government over Iraq but with little distinctive to say on domestic policy. </p> <p>The party's home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said yesterday: \"As a third party you are necessarily a guerrilla army. We have a popular leader and we have made the right decisions on Iraq, but when you are on 24 -25% in the polls and serious about forming a government or replacing the Conservatives [as the main opposition party], we have to have bigger depth to our policies. We are growing up as a party.\"</p> <p>There has been hidden tension within the party over the pro-competition stance of its radical Treasury team. The group had to work hard to ensure Charles Kennedy did not reject the role of choice and markets in improving public services in a keynote speech on public service reform.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy's aides had been tempted to reject choice, partly because both Labour and the Tories had embraced the concept. </p> <p>The book, due to be published this month and called The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism, has been edited by the party shadow chief secretary, David Laws. It contains contributions from many rising stars, including Nick Clegg, trade and industry spokesman in the European parliament and prospective parliamentary candidate for the safe Lib Dem seat of Sheffield Hallam. </p> <p>The book will stress the importance of voluntarism, self-help and self-government above that of the state. </p> <p>The aim is also to show that the Liberal Democrats are now a grown-up force in British politics with a front bench that is the intellectual match of the Conservatives. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are likely to make gains at the next election from both parties, but most winnable seats are Tory. </p> <p>Mr Clegg will admit that in some respects Liberal Democrat European policy has lost touch with the Eurosceptic mood of the country. </p> <p>He will suggest that social and labour market policy powers should be returned to the nation state. </p> <p>The Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, will condemn the common agricultural policy as \"an economic, moral and environmental disaster\". </p> <p>Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten is to advocate what he describes as tough liberalism in penal reform. He said yesterday: \"Current penal policy is to let people sit around in cells 24 hours a day reading magazines and watching TV.\" </p> <p>A really tough liberal policy, the book argues, would require prisoners to get out of their cells, study English and not be allowed out of jail until they can fill in a job application and have basic vocational skills. </p> <p>Steve Webb, the party's work and pensions spokesman, will also look at the role of the state in helping the family, arguing that even liberals cannot regard the family as a totally private matter. </p> <p>Criticism of Mr Kennedy's stance on choice is reflected in the current newsletter of the Liberal Future thinktank. This warns that although the party may \"ride the crest of Labour's unpopularity\" at the next general election it risks being damaged by current policies \"inconsistent with our principles\". </p> <p>It calls on party leaders not to \"promise what cannot be delivered using rhetoric that seems designed to gain a temporary boost in popularity\".</p>",
  "<p>\"Graffiti is not art, it's crime.\" So say 122 MPs including Tony Blair, who all signed Keep Britain Tidy's drafted statement (Graffiti blamed on 'cult of cool', August 2). But graffiti has been with us for centuries, and I hope it will stay. It would be some sort of hell to live in a world without character, without evidence of having been lived in - a sterile world of new corporate buildings, slick clean brick and metal and no sign of any urban culture. </p> <p>Walk down most high streets these days and they all look the same; perhaps only the graffiti and flyposters sets each city apart. </p> <p>I feel a rush from coming across a plain old door marked with a kind of calligraphic flourish, from seeing layer on layer of peeled and scrawled paint sitting and half-torn fly posters - there's a whole story behind that. The wall becomes a canvas, built over time by many incidents, a composition of colour, shape and line. Now take a look at the new clean wall with no character and no sign of life.<br> <strong>Sean Rorker</strong><br> Loughborough, Leics </p> <p>London's boroughs and communities not only support the Keep Britain Tidy group's drive to highlight the misery caused by graffiti, but are taking action to rub the problem out in the capital. Graffiti costs boroughs nearly \u00a37m a year to clean up. It also blights communities, leaving some people feeling threatened by unsightly and offensive images and words. </p> <p>As a result of the Association of London Government's lobbying, the government's Anti-Social Behaviour Act also includes a ban on the sale of spray paints to people under 18, and the power for boroughs to remove graffiti from post boxes, telephone boxes and other street furniture owned by utility firms. Graffiti not only makes areas appear run down but also inflates people's fear of crime.<br> <strong>Cllr Phil Portwood</strong><br> Chairman, Association of London Government's Transport and Environment Committee </p> <p>Tony Blair and his 121 parliamentary colleagues may enjoy the sanitised, squeaky-clean environment commended by the Keep Britain Tidy campaign. I prefer one where public creativity is welcomed rather than criminalised, and where spaces are provided for street artists to express it.<br> <strong>Kurt Paulus</strong><br> Bradford-on-Avon, Wilts </p> <p>Sue Nelson is right to point out that \"evil thrives when good men do nothing\". That's the very reason artists such as Banksy are risking prison to put out alternative messages and images and reclaiming our urban spaces from global corporations and big business. </p> <p>A lot of graffiti is unsightly, but we are living in a frightening time when artists, environmentalists, animal rights campaigners and any individuals who question and challenge the state are in danger of being labelled \"evil\".<br> <strong>Carrie Reichardt</strong><br> London<br></p>",
  "<p>ITV has suffered its worst ever month after being caught in a pincer movement between BBC1 and Channel 4, which enjoyed record audiences thanks to cricket and Big Brother and other reality shows.</p> <p>ITV1 has been hit by a double ratings whammy - registering its lowest ever weekly audience share last week and lowest ever monthly share in July.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Channel 4 enjoyed its best month for ratings since July 2002, when the antics of Big Brother 3 contestants, including Jade Goody and Kate Lawler, shot the reality show to its biggest ever audiences.</p> <p>Last month ITV1 was hit by a combination of Channel 4's reality hits, such as Wife Swap, Supernanny and Big Brother, along with its own underperforming dramas, Making Waves, Rose and Maloney and Island at War.</p> <p>ITV1's ratings performance in July also suffered because of live sport on rival channels, with Euro 2004 and Wimbledon luring viewers to BBC1 at the start of the month and England's back to back Test cricket victories last week boosting Channel 4's audience figures.</p> <p>Executives at ITV will be hoping its new property reality show, The Block, which started on ITV1 last night, can help improve its fortunes.</p> <p>The Block comes with impeccable credentials - the format has already been a big hit in Australia and the UK version is being made by RDF Media, the independent producer behind Channel 4 reality hits such as Wife Swap and Faking It.</p> <p>ITV bosses will also be banking on a strong showing from its autumn schedule to turn round its ratings performance before the end of the year.</p> <p>The network's autumn season includes Simon Cowell's new talent show, X-Factor, plus the return of entertainment hits I'm A Celebrity...

  "<p>The Squirrel Fun Park is one of 11 Park Products available from a stall that will be roaming London's Kensington Gardens until the end of September. The project was developed by the Serpentine Gallery's artists-in-residence, Kathrin B\u00f6hm and Andreas Lang. If I can entice a trick from a squirrel, I win the hoop - and the nut-dangler that comes with it. </p> <p>Other prizes include the Chompost Bar, top-dollar royal compost in the shape of a slab of Dairy Milk, a reward for helping the gardeners; the Hand-Bag, \"a bio-degradable plastic sack with an integrated arm and glove\", to be filled with litter in exchange for a selection of seasonal plants and bulbs; and the Tray for Two, a one-handed drinks holder - yours for waiting on a stranger, and engaging them in conversation. </p> <p>It may sound like simple summer fun, but this is art with a purpose: to trick passersby into caring for their environment. And a critic informs us in the accompanying booklet that B\u00f6hm and Lang have \"engaged the intersection between art as a critical venture, design as a problem-solving exercise, and architecture as a social process\", just in case we hadn't realised how clever it all was. </p> <p>But what eco-purpose is served by making squirrels jump through hoops? It tempts them away from digging up the gardeners' bulbs, says stallholder James. And, ingeniously, the squirrels even become gardeners themselves. By burying their hard-won peanuts and seeds for later, they inadvertently plant peanut trees and sunflowers for the public to enjoy. I am told that any sunflowers you see in Kensington Gardens from now on will have been planted by squirrels. </p> <p>So, with years of practice tempting mice to their deaths, I fancied my chances with Kensington's pampered rodents. And I came very close. One small animal stood in front of the hoop for more than a minute, staring at the nut suspended on the other side just an inch in front of his nose - until a larger creature chased it away. For all B\u00f6hm and Lang's virtuous inventiveness, in this event at least, greed prevailed.</p>",
  "<p>Over the next few years there is going to be a boom in the business of making money from Ministry of Defence (MoD) castoffs. The government review announced last month will see massive reductions in equipment. The Royal Navy will scrap 15 vessels by the end of 2005, the army will have four fewer infantry battalions and the RAF will be down four aircraft squadrons and at least one air base. </p> <p>The government wants to ensure that every piece of equipment no longer needed does not go to waste. </p> <p>The MoD's disposal services agency (DSA) and its 80 staff are responsible for everything from boots to battleships. Items not mothballed or picked over for spares will be sold for reuse if possible, or recycled. You can at present pick up armoured personnel carriers, fire engines, motorbikes and bullet-proof Ford Mondeos. </p> <p>The big money deals of the past involve items such as the Hercules aircraft sold to Austria, the warships that went to Bangladesh, Romania and Chile and the long-term Al Hussein Project, which has earned Britain \u00a312m by selling Challenger tanks, ammunition and training to Jordan. </p> <p>The obvious benefit for the UK is that it gets to make money out of equipment it no longer needs and might otherwise have to expensively scrap. It creates a future market for spares and can give the defence industry a foot in the door where it previously may have had little presence. </p> <p>Commodore Sym Taylor, the DSA's chief executive, says: \"The sale of surplus equipment gives UK exporters a marketing edge. The UK will be well placed to secure repeat orders. These orders are likely to be for new rather than secondhand equipment and therefore of much greater value.\" </p> <p>But the Campaign Against the Arms Trade takes an alternative view. A spokesman says: \"It doesn't really matter if the bullets are secondhand; weapons exports, especially to regions where there are conflicts or the countries are desperately poor, do not help.\" </p> <p>If the frigates earmarked to be made redundant do end up heading overseas then they will require a licence from the Department of Trade and Industry. These are designed to ensure that such exports are sold to appropriate governments, although campaigners say this is no more than fig leaf protection. </p> <p>The range of military equipment that needs to be dealt with presents the DSA with some challenges. Only when resale to other armed forces has failed are other options considered. When no government wanted to buy the frigate HMS Scylla, it was eventually sold to the National Marine Aquarium, and in March was scuttled off the Cornish coast to be used by divers. </p> <p>Most items are handed over to a select group of outside contractors, such as vehicle specialist Witham. It refurbishes hundreds of vehicles and sells them on, either through auction or private sale. Managing director Paul Foutherington says: \"We never know what we are going to get. In the last auction we sold a Chieftain tank for \u00a317,200 to a company that is going to use it as an advertising hoarding. </p> <p>In total, DSA contractors made more than \u00a35m in the last financial year from selling some 2,250 vehicles. </p> <p>The agency sells other items directly, and on its website you can find inflatable bridges, portable laundry units, radar and helicopters up for grabs. One of the most successful areas has been the sale of unwanted computers. Later this year the DSA plans to set up its own version of eBay - eTrade Exchange - which will put the agency, customers and contractors in touch with each other. </p> <p>When redundant equipment cannot be sold the DSA's official strategy is: \"Whenever possible ... to recycle equipment and material and contribute disposal policies aimed at protecting and enhancing the environment.\" It has a network of contractors that can strip items of anything that can be recycled. </p> <p>Taylor says: \"The DSA takes all environmental issues very seriously not just because of legislation but also simply because it makes economic and commercial sense. </p> <p>\"We know that disposal is a key part of the procurement cycle and managing this aspect sensibly produces a host of real benefits. On the other hand, neglecting it costs time and money and creates additional problems, not least a bad public image.\" </p> <p>There is now even an MoD Environmental Protection Training School. So far 1,300 civilian and service personnel have graduated from its three-day course on waste management. </p> <p>Barry Teideman, the DSA's business development director, says: \"The disposal of redundant or obsolete equipment may not seem particularly exciting, but no one, especially those in the defence sector, should ignore the subject, nor believe these issues will go away.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The disoposal services agency is at <a href=\"http://www.disposalservices.agency.mod.uk\">www.disposalservices.agency.mod.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Friends like these </strong><br> Peter Harper and Paul Allen from the Centre for Alternative Technology, talking at the Gaia and global change meeting at Dartington Hall, Devon, started with the premise that: \"The worst possible nuclear disasters are not as bad as the worst possible climate change disasters.\" Much later they said: \"What we suggest now (at the risk of becoming pariahs in the official green community) is to debate the following scheme: that we start with a modest revival of nuclear energy in sites where there are already nuclear installations, where local jobs make people sympathetic to the idea. Say 10 1,200MW pressurised water reactors or equivalent, with a 40-year design life, and no replacements. Use converted military uranium as well, and gradually run down the UK's military-nuclear capacity, as a way of promoting non-proliferation. This will help to sell the idea to the sceptics.\" It might take more than that lads, and some wag asked if they would be joining David Bellamy in an anti-wind protest next. </p> <p><strong> Sand storm </strong> </p> <p>To conform with the EU habitats directive that sand dunes should be allowed to revert to their natural state, the Forestry Commission, Wales is planning to clear-fell the trees at Newborough on the Isle of Anglesey that were planted on the dunes.

Squirrel fans are making urgent representations to Brussels. </p> <p><strong> Alien invasion </strong> <br>A battle is going on in Kenya over the introduction of biotech trees, a scheme apparently backed by the UK-based Gatsby Charitable Foundation and Mondi Forest of South Africa, which is part of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification scheme. GM eucalyptus is to replace the country's forest cover. Some Kenyans who want to plant native trees have vowed to fight the initiative, and international campaigners who have been muttering \"outrageous\" and \"unbelievable\" will be asking questions about the FSC's credentials. </p> <p><strong> Down on the dump </strong><br> It was party time on Saturday at Crich, in Derbyshire, home of the National Tramway Village but also, for 38 years, Rolls-Royce's dump for radioactive materials such as enriched uranium, Cobalt-60 and Carbon-14.

Now the waste will go to Drigg in Cumbria and the site, at Hilts Quarry in the village centre, will be restored.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Equal measures</strong><br> Stephan Cross levels various charges at Unison (Cross purposes, July 28) that are simply not true. Unison takes pay inequality seriously, and has used the law on many occasions to challenge employers and governments. Our strategy is to negotiate pay arrangements that deliver equal pay, and to litigate where this does not deliver. </p> <p>It is outrageous for Cross to claim that Unison has done \"bugger all\" to push single status forward. It was Unison and other unions that negotiated the single status agreement, not some no win, no fee lawyer. </p> <p>Cross says that if branches will do deals with him he will drop his costs to 10%. We would prefer our members to get the money, not a lawyer. Unison does not do backdoor deals. It is a democratic organisation. </p> <p>Cross \"accuses\" us of defending two branch secretaries. Unison will do its utmost to resist any attempts to intimidate hardworking branch officials who are doing a very difficult job. In addition, Unison has no understanding, tacit or otherwise, to downgrade men's pay rather than lift women's. </p> <p>Finally, the simplest way to achieve equal pay is through direct negotiation with employing authorities. This is what Unison does. Litigation can take years, and while this is happening pay inequlaity continues. <br><strong>Dave Prentis</strong><br>General secretary, Unison </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong> Unlike private lawyers, the GMB union has to balance its strategy to deliver equal pay, prevent detriment to workers and protect future jobs and services. We will continue to pursue this strategy long after private lawyers have banked their cash and moved on to find the next \"window of opportunity\". Every penny that is paid to a lawyer is a penny less for single status and for low-paid women workers. </p> <p>To date, we have lodged 1,500 equal pay claims in the northern region. We have gained around \u00a314m in compensation for female members and achieved pay increases from 10% to 40% in some cases for those members. We are collating information from more than 2,000 completed equal pay questionnaires, and in the absence of proposals from employers to deal with past inequalities and the implementation of single status we will lodge further equal pay claims. </p> <p>We are driven in this process by our desire to do the best we can for our members, not for a pot of cash. We care about the future jobs and services that may be under threat from the costs of mass litigation, unlike certain lawyers who have only one agenda in mind, in our view, personal profit from the litigation process. </p> <p>We will not be diverted from our policy to achieve equal pay for all our members in the public services. <br><strong>Colin Smith</strong><br>Senior organiser, GMB northern region </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The issue of regrading staff in local government is much wider than gender inequality. </p> <p>I worked for four different Labour-controlled councils. With the exception of Greenwich, all delayed processing the regrading claims of lower paid white collar staff. </p> <p>Usually staff left in frustration before their appeals could be held. Delays of five years or more were not uncommon. The councils sincerely believed that they upheld workers interests, but the delays in processing claims for lower-paid workers contrasted with the remarkable speed with which senior management salaries were increased. <br><strong>Roger Blackhouse</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> On your bike</strong><br> Ken Worpole's analysis of the failure of cycling to grip the public imagination in the UK misses the point (Chain reaction, July 28). The national cycle route is not filling up because Britain does not have a cycling culture. The work of Sustrans does make a contribution to the creation of such a culture, but the main driver has to be cycling as an alternative to private motor transport rather than as a recreational activity. </p> <p>I know several keen recreational cyclists who would not consider cycling (or using public transport) to travel to work. While cycling of any kind has undoubted health benefits for cyclists, the real environmental benefits will only occur when cycling is used for the multitude of regular short journeys that we undertake, principally commuting to work, but also shopping and attending social events. For these trips the national cycle route is of no direct relevance, unless you live near part of it. </p> <p>What this country has lacked is a concerted and consistent cycling policy from national government down to the level of local authorities, with resources to match. Worpole is right when he says that we need to work towards a \"tipping point\" - when cyclists become so numerous that their needs will be taken seriously - but visibility will only be achieved if it happens on our commuting and shopping routes. <br><strong>Ralph Mackridge</strong><br>Research student, faculty of the built environment, University of the West of England, Bristol </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> I recall great convoys of cycling workers going to and from the Vickers Armstrong factory at Brooklands. No motorist had much chance of getting past, they would have to travel at 10mph. However, in the late 1950s it became the fashionable thing to be a motorist. Now the problem is not so much the lack of cyclists, but the mass of cars and lorries. </p> <p>To get to a cycleway, many like me would have to brave sharing long miles of ordinary roads with the significant majority of drivers who make little concession to the cyclist. </p> <p>As Worpole points out, in parts of Europe they have \"joined up\" cycleways - many can wheel straight out of their front door on to one. <br><strong>David Mills</strong><br>York </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Write to: SocietyGuardian 119 Farringdon Road London EC1R 3ER or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\">society@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The millennium may not be very old, but there's no doubt which news story has dominated it thus far. Since the attacks on the twin towers on September 11 2001, terrorism has remained at the top of the news agenda. Whether it is terrorist incidents, arrests, warnings from politicians or coverage of the actions carried out in the name of the \"war on terror\", we have seen more sustained coverage of the issue than at any other time in the modern era. </p> <p>This is true even if we exclude the peak year of 2001. Since January 2002, the Times, Financial Times, the Guardian, the Mail and the Mirror, have, between them, run an average of 400 stories about international terrorism every year. And the trend is upward, not downward. If we compare that with a four-and-a-half-year period before 9/11 (from 1997 to mid 2001), this amounts to a five-fold increase in news coverage. </p> <p>Conventional wisdom - informed by a steady stream of political rhetoric - says that this is a response to the increasing risk posed by global terrorism since the attack on the twin towers. Indeed, the British government's recent leaflet advising citizens what to do in the event of an attack - together with a succession of warnings from the US government - imply the risk has reached unprecedented levels. And yet what is strikingly absent from both public discussion or news coverage is that there is little concrete evidence to support this view. </p> <p>The US government's own figures on international terrorism - which it defines as the targeting of non-combatants or property by non-state agents and includes the actions of groups like the IRA, the UDF and Eta - suggests that the most active period of international terrorist activity was the mid-80s. With occasional blips - such as 1991 and 1999 to 2001 - the annual number of terrorist attacks has been in general decline since then. </p> <p>The evidence suggests that the attack on 9/11 was not the dawn of a new era of global terrorism, but a devastating one-off. Indeed, the years since then have seen fewer incidents per year than at any time in the last 20 years. The recent annual rate is only a third of the level reached between 1985 and 1988. </p> <p>But surely the attacks in the US, Bali and Madrid show that the scale of terrorist attacks has escalated, even if there are fewer of them? Well, again, the figures tell a different story. In terms of the number of casual ties of international terrorism from 1998 to 2003, the peak year was not 2001, as most people might assume. Despite the 4,465 casualties on 9/11 (which alone accounted for 77% ofcasualties that year) there were more victims from international terrorist attacks three years earlier, in 1998. </p> <p>The fact that 80% of the casualties that year were in Africa might partly explain (though by no means excuse) the lack of political and media interest. But this explanation only goes so far: after all, many of the 1998 incidents involved attacks by al-Qaida on US targets, and there were also a comparatively high number of casualties (405) that year in western Europe. </p> <p>Indeed, a closer look at the last 20 years of media coverage of international terrorism reveals that there is little relation between the number of international terrorist incidents in any given year and the use of the term in the press. </p> <p>If we take the Times, Financial Times and the Guardian, for example, we see fluctuations in media coverage that bear little relation to global trends. International terrorism became highly newsworthy in 1986 (receiving more mentions than any of the last 20 years except 2001). This was the year in which Libya became the b\u00eate noire of international terrorism, and President Reagan ordered the bombing of Tripoli. But while the US data shows an increase in the number of terrorist attacks in 1987, news coverage that year dropped significantly, to less than a quarter of the 1986 level. </p> <p>But the biggest mismatch between the coverage of terrorism and terrorist incidents is, without doubt, the period from 2002 to the present day. News coverage is at its highest-ever sustained level, while there have been fewer terrorist attacks than at any time in the last two decades. </p> <p>How to explain this discrepancy? Well, unfortunately, it's not unusual to see media coverage bear little relation to actual levels of risk. Media research on agenda-setting shows that - whether the topic is crime, drugs, war or the environment - there is often little relation between the volume of coverage and real-world trends. </p> <p>In many instances, what the media are responding to is not an increase in the problem but an increase of political rhetoric. Both the war on drugs and the war on terror boosted media coverage which, in turn, justified a series of political initiatives. </p> <p>This, combined with the US-centric nature of British news media, meant that the idea that \"the world changed\" on 9/11 became a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, just as the war on drugs in the US in the late 80s led to a massive increase in news coverage about the issue - while drug use remained fairly static - so the war on terror has made every act, threat or worry about terrorism far more newsworthy than hitherto. </p> <p>This kind of coverage distorts our perception of risk. So, despite the government's chief scientific adviser's warning that global warming is a much greater threat to life than global terrorism, terrorism ranks high on the public's list of concerns, while climate change scarcely registers. Worse, it creates a news climate - in the US at least - where politicians can expend considerable energy and public money on the war on terror while issues like global warming can be brushed aside. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:lewisj2@cardiff.ac.uk\">Justin Lewis</a> is professor of communication at the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies.</p>"
