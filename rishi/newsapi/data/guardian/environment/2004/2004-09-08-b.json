  "<p>Just as the financial markets are convinced that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold today, they are certain that the United States Federal Reserve is going to put up its Fed funds rate again in two weeks' time. </p> <p>Often our economy follows a similar path to that of our American cousins, but things seem to have moved out of synch during recent months. </p> <p>The Bank of England raised rates rapidly from 3.5% late last year to 4.75% in July as the economy steamed along at well above its long-term trend rate, threatening to stoke inflation in the not too distant future. </p> <p>But suddenly signs are emerging that the dearer money is having a dampening effect here - especially on the housing market but also on retailing and in the manufacturing sector. Most City economists now expect the second half of the year to be distinctly less whizzy than the first. British rates, like growth, may already have reached a peak in the cycle, some argue. </p> <p>Not so in the US. The Fed started raising rates only in June - and then from a 46-year low of 1%. With growth roaring ahead and inflation appearing to rise, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan looked distinctly late in raising rates from such a low base. </p> <p>When he did lever them up to 1.5% last month, the US economy promptly entered a soft patch, apparently because of surging oil prices and in spite of what are still rock-bottom borrowing costs. </p> <p>If the sluggishness continues, the Fed has precious little room to move rates back down again. </p> <p>No wonder Mr Greenspan sounded re lieved yesterday, announcing that the US economy has \"regained some traction\". </p> <p>No wonder, too, that the rate-setters at the Bank of England sound so pleased when they talk of borrowing costs being more or less where they want them: they have some room to cut if and when the housing market slumps. </p> <p><strong>Head in the clouds</strong><br> </p> <p>British Airways has developed something of a communication problem in recent times. It has upset its workforce, the unions, the customers - and now seemingly the City. </p> <p>What should have been a good news story about paying down debt with the raising of much-needed cash in Australia yesterday turned into a panic among investors about what BA was planning to do with the money. </p> <p>Chief executive Rod Eddington insisted the sale of the Qantas stake would be used to cut into the company's \u00a35.6bn mountain of debt. </p> <p>But instead of leaving it at that, he muddied the water by announcing the sale would make BA fitter for future European consolidation. </p> <p>Consolidation? With all the recent speculation suggesting BA might bid for Ireland's Aer Lingus and/or Spain's Iberia, this was not very wise. The shares slid 3% as investors fretted about the BA boss embarking on a spending spree. </p> <p>Mr Eddington insists he does not want to do cross-border mergers until the regulatory skies are clearer and there is precious little sign of that. </p> <p>Longtime BA watchers such as Chris Avery at JP Morgan believe him and say there will be no move on Iberia in the near future. </p> <p>If that is true then we have a storm in an airline cabin cup. Yet it dents the Australian's image as a straight talker - as does continual speculation that Mr Eddington will step down next year. He keeps denying it and yet those who claim to be in the know continue to insist it is true. </p> <p>At least over at Ryanair we can be sure Michael O'Leary will always tell it like it really is. </p> <p><strong>Cook's tour</strong><br> </p> <p>The recent Guardian survey of Britain's top 100 companies found that just 114 of the 1,400 or so board directorships are held by women and only 17 of these are full-time positions. </p> <p>The vast majority of female representation in company boardrooms is in non-executive roles. </p> <p>One of those who figured in last year's survey - which primarily covered the 2003 financial year - was Karen Cook in her capacity as a non-executive at electrical retailer Dixons. </p> <p>She left Dixons in 2003 but will appear once again in next year's numbers thanks to her appointment yesterday as a non-executive of Tesco, the country's largest supermarket chain. </p> <p>Ms Cook is a managing director of investment bank Goldman Sachs, where she advises companies on mergers and acquisitions. Prior to joining Goldman she was co-head of corporate finance at Schroders, and advised on deals such as the break-up of the Burton group. </p> <p>She is now joining the most expensive board in Britain (all of Tesco's executive directors earned more than \u00a31.8m last year) and a company that is a genuine global success story. </p> <p>But her appointment has immediately triggered all the usual media cliches about \"Superwoman\" raising six kids, etc, and still finding time to bustle her way into a top British boardroom. </p> <p>It's very tedious and it offers another illustration, perhaps, as to why women are so difficult to find at the top of the corporate ladder.</p>",
  "<b> Sporting life</b> <br> <b> United, we stand; City, we fall</b> <br> According to a new study by Staffordshire University, supporting a losing football team is bad for your health, causing sleeplessness, anxiety and headaches. It's hardly surprising. After all, only last year there was another report saying that watching your team lose at home increased your chance of a heart attack by 30%. But is it all true? <p>Let's explore this scientifically. According to a 30-year-long survey carried out by the esteemed research organisation SIMON, Manchester City fans are far more likely to be bald, fat and unhealthy than Manchester United fans. SIMON says that while City fans are more likely to have high blood pressure and heart attacks than United fans, this is not a poor performance indicator - it is a reflection of class, wealth and breeding. City fans fulfil every northern cliche: we love our fish, chips, mushy peas, gherkin on the side, four slices of bread and butter, and bucket of ale to wash it down. United fans are less likely to fulfil the classic northern cliche because they are less likely to come from the north. </p> <p>Another measure of football health is celebrity supporters. Now, at City we have more than our fair share of famous fans, and they tend to back up the Staffordshire thesis. Kevin Kennedy, who played Curly Watts in Coronation Street for so many years, blamed his alcoholism on being a City fan. Eddie Large, half of the legendary comedy team Little and Large, is appropriately large and unhealthy. Bernard Manning would doubtless be svelte, fit and politically correct were he not a City fan. </p> <p>And yet anecdotes - even anecdotes supported by fact - do not tell the full story. Let me tell you the tale of my Uncle Maurice from Southport. You couldn't have met a finer man than Uncle Maurice, even though he was a mad United fan. Uncle Maurice was getting on a bit, had a slightly dicky ticker, and United were playing Everton in the FA Cup Final. Uncle Maurice told Auntie Bess that he couldn't face watching the match because it gave him all sorts of stresses that he could well do without. Now Bess, who loved Maurice like nobody's business, told him he was being a daft bugger and that he shouldn't deny himself one of life's great pleasures. So she turned the telly on for him with a few minutes to go. The score was 0-0. United broke away, Norman Whiteside scored one of the great cup final goals, and Uncle Maurice had a heart attack and died on the spot. Which only goes to show that supporting a successful side can be equally bad for your health. </p> <p>Perhaps the solution is to support mediocre clubs that never do much either way - Villa, say, or Spurs, or Southampton. Then again, we would probably die of boredom.<br> <b>Simon Hattenstone</b> </p> <p><b> Visual arts</b><br> <b> Tracey goes to the Tate</b><br> This week, Tracey Emin was given a room of her own at Tate Britain. The gallery has bought eight of her works in a rare bulk deal, thus placing her among the greats of British art. </p> <p>The night before last I was at Tate Britain, surrounded by my friends, surrounded by my work, and I felt quite good about the situation. I am 41, I am 100% alive, and I am extremely well represented by the Tate. I know my work is going to be well looked after long after I am gone. This is a very safe, cosy feeling. Even though the work is a permanent collection, the works selected have a curatorial impact. A result of the sharp eye of Gregor Muir, the curator. There are works there that I would never have parted with, for example My Nan. I really love the lavender doll, because the smell reminds me of my nan. It is fantastic - if I miss her, I can just pop down the Tate. </p> <p>People have used the word establishment, well why not, why is the establishment always associated with conservative? I think it is amazing that the Tate is showing my neons \"Is Anal Sex Legal?\" and \"Is Legal Sex Anal?\", which actually, up until recently, was illegal between men and women. The blanket \"Hate and Power What A Terrible Thing\", isn't only about Thatcher, it's about all the kinds of women in the world who behave in a cruel way, who hurt other women and other women's children. I remember being horrified at a rape case where a young girl had held down the victim while egging on her male friends to commit rape. It seemed worse that it was a woman. </p> <p>It is great publicly to be able to get your point across. For me, art has always been about communication. Whether it's film, video, text, neon, sculpture, I am always trying to get a message across. Tate Britain, what a great environment to be in.<br> <b>Tracey Emin</b> </p> <p><b> Mind your language</b><br> <b> Nice boys don't say 'gift'</b><br> Newspaper articles in which Tory MP Nicholas Soames features as a pompous toff are many and pleasing. Yesterday's Independent offered us another. It reported that Soames was \"apoplectic\" about a hoax letter circulated in his name. Purporting to be addressed to a Tory colleague, it contained details of an apparent political scandal. It also contained the sentence, \"The gifts were most generous and I attach a letter of thanks.\" There is the evidence that it is a fake, said Soames. \"I've never in my life used the word gift. It's rather like saying toilet. It's a 'present', and everyone associated with me knows that.\" </p> <p>Will there not be some Guardian readers who, to use a phrase that is beyond the pale, know where he's coming from? Who does say gift (except as in \"You get a free gift with each purchase\")? Are there not words that even the middle classes avoid - not for being imprecise, or slangish, or American, but because they are non-U? Some of them have been with us for decades. If you refer to a room in your house as the lounge, you are revealing something about your class origins. The middle classes (and above) have lunch (not dinner) in the middle of the day and supper (not tea) in the evening. They use napkins, not serviettes, and end the meal with pudding, not sweet. </p> <p>Many of these usages were recorded in 1955 in Nancy Mitford's \"The English Aristocracy\", the essay that first popularised the idea of U and non-U vocabulary. Some of her stipulations now seem archaic: dentures is non-U (say false teeth); glasses is non-U (say spectacles). Bye-bye (rather than goodbye), she advises, is \"dreadful\". </p> <p>Other non-U words that she records have shifted in recent years. Pace Nicholas Soames, toilet is surely one example. Once incorrigibly working- and lower-middle-class, the word has been brought home from nurseries and primary schools by so many children as to become embourgeoisified. And isn't the once irredeemable patio now nudging its way up the social ladder? </p> <p>Classless we may fancy ourselves, but not in our words. What of newer non-U words, unrecorded by the blessed Nancy? Scent for perfume? What about bum (rather than bottom)? The exclamation \"Bless!\" in response to infant sweetness is both recent and utterly non-U. Several such usages cluster around children. I confess that I flinch from the word kids, though middle-class parents do use it in order to sound demotic. </p> <p>Class still speaks through us. Nicholas Soames added to his comment about diction a further protest, that he would never write a letter of thanks \"to be circulated\". \"I'm not that fucking rude.\" \"Fucking\", of course, is as U as can be. <br> <b>John Mullan</b></p>",
  "<p>BMW, the German premium car group, is on course to overtake annual sales of arch-rival Mercedes for the first time in almost a decade, new figures showed yesterday. </p> <p>The day after the Mercedes group said its global sales had fallen just under 5% so far this year to 760,300, its Munich-based competitor posted an 8% jump in the first eight months of 2004 to 769,086. </p> <p>The mixed fortunes enjoyed by Germany's leading upmarket car makers were highlighted by sales last month in their domestic market, with Mercedes down 18% to 24,500 and BMW up 20%, despite the sluggish economy. </p> <p>Mercedes, part of Daimler Chrysler, has been hurt by fallout from this summer's dispute with unions over its now agreed plans to cut \u20ac500m (\u00a3340m) in costs amid threats to transfer up to 6,000 jobs overseas. </p> <p>The group, which includes the Smart small car series, said Mercedes sales had been hit - down 9% in August - by the forthcoming change of models, but the launch of the A-class this week would bring a \"significant boost\" in the fourth quarter. </p> <p>But BMW, which includes Mini and Rolls-Royce, suggested Mercedes had also been damaged by the problems surrounding Daimler's ill-starred investment in Japanese car maker Mitsubishi. The German group also offloaded its 10.5% stake last month in Korean company Hyundai. </p> <p>Industry sources indicated that Mercedes suffered because its parent, still struggling to overcome losses at its American group Chrysler, continued to build and market premium and volume cars under the same roof - unlike BMW, which ended its experiment in the same guise by selling MG Rover for \u00a310 four years ago. </p> <p>\"Customers don't want to buy a Mercedes if they think it's got components from a Chrysler or a Mitsubishi; they want a 100% Mercedes and no loss of quality,\" they said. </p> <p>Even though Mercedes sales fell in August for the seventh month this year, the firm said its global sales should approach last year's 1.1m. But BMW said it expected to surpass last year's total by just under 10%. </p> <p>The last time BMW outsold Mercedes was in 1995.</p>",
  "<p>The French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn sought to strengthen its green credentials yesterday with the launch of a new system that cuts petrol consumption and emissions by automatically switching off the engine at traffic lights or in queues. </p> <p>PSA says the \"Stop &amp; Start\" system cuts fuel consumption by 10% in normal city driving and by up to 15% in traffic jams. </p> <p>The system, which works with a semi-automatic gear box, cuts in as the driver brakes. As the car stops the engine is switched to stand-by mode, where it remains as long as there is pressure on the brake pedal. The engine restarts once the accelerator is depressed. </p> <p>PSA says CO2 emissions, which the company describes as \"the greatest threat to the environment\", are cut by similar levels to fuel consumption and that noise levels are also reduced. The first model to be fitted with the system will be the Citro\u00ebn C3. Other models will be equipped with the system at a later date. Stop &amp; Start will be available in the UK next year. </p> <p>Jean-Martin Folz, PSA chief executive, said: \"Judging by some of the traffic conditions in some British cities, I would say there are going to be interesting savings in fuel costs.\"</p>",
  "Two simultaneous reshuffles tonight saw Alan Milburn return to the cabinet and Alan Johnson appointed as work and pensions secretary, while Michael Howard reordered the Conservative frontbench in a surprise spoiler move, which saw John Redwood return to frontline politics. <p>At 8.45pm, Downing Street finally announced a replacement for Andrew Smith, who resigned on Monday, after the former higher education minister Alan Johnson was seen smiling broadly as he left No 10 where he had an early evening meeting with Mr Blair.</p> <p>But the bigger sensation was the return of the former health secretary, who resigned less than two years ago to spend more time with his family.

  "Alan Milburn's return to frontline politics will further fuel speculation that he will one day challenge Gordon Brown for the leadership of the Labour party. <p>Before that, however, he will have to work with the chancellor on general election planning and policy for Labour's likely third term, both issues that his potential leadership rival believes he should have a key role in.</p> <p>The two men fell out when Mr Milburn pursued a belligerent Blairite agenda as health secretary. His proposal to establish semi-autonomous foundation hospitals infuriated the chancellor, who opposed allowing them to undertake their own borrowing, as well as alarming many Labour backbenchers.</p> <p>It was, however, left to John Reid to take the plans through the House of Commons, when Mr Milburn abandoned high office 18 months ago to spend more time with his family.</p> <p>On the backbenches, he renewed his partnership with fellow ex-cabinet minister, Stephen Byers, acting as ideological outriders to the Blairite project, urging greater reform of public services. In that role, he took on the chairmanship of Progress, the New Labour loyalist pressure group, and contributed ideas to the party's manifesto. </p> <p>But despite his New Labour credentials, Mr Milburn's background was on the hard left - he was even rumoured to have been a member of Tariq Ali's International Marxist Group. He ran a leftwing bookshop, Days of Hope (nicknamed \"Haze of Dope\") after he abandoned his PhD on 18th century radicalism in the north-east.</p> <p>Born on January 27 1958, Mr Milburn was brought up single-handedly by his mother, a secretary in the local NHS, in the County Durham mining village of Tow Law, which has since been described as a \"staunch Labour environment\". He attended state school in Newcastle and Cleveland before going on to Lancaster University for his BA in history. His uncompleted PhD was begun at Newcastle University. </p> <p>His modest background is said to have influenced his determination to reform the welfare state. \"I grew up on a council housing estate in the middle of County Durham, and it isn't a very nice thing when you come home from school and find your door, which was red in the morning, has been painted yellow,\" he said. \"My mum had not agreed for it to be painted yellow, someone from the council did.\" </p> <p>Active in politics in the north-east, Mr Milburn edited a trade union-sponsored tabloid newspaper, Rostrum as well as chairing Trade Union CND. Milburn landed a job with the county council-backed trade union studies information unit, and masterminded the campaign to save shipbuilding in Sunderland. </p> <p>Though unsuccessful, the experience of high-profile campaigning is understood to have convinced the young activist that he could make it in national politics. The long hair and the beard had already gone, and the search for a safe seat was soon to begin. </p> <p>Mr Milburn landed the seat of Darlington in 1992 and soon became a well-known backbencher. With his office-mate and fellow north-east MP Mr Byers, he repeatedly embarrassed the then Conservative government with a string of probing parliamentary questions; the answers to which were inevitably countered by reams of press releases. </p> <p>His success in generating media attention meant he was marked out as a high-flyer from virtually the moment Tony Blair took over the Labour leadership in 1994. </p> <p>Once Labour took office in 1997, Mr Milburn was appointed a junior health minister in charge of promoting private finance initiative (PFI) projects to build new hospitals with the controversial public-private partnerships. In 1998, he joined the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury, working under his future rival, Mr Brown. A year later he succeeded Frank Dobson as health secretary. </p> <p>His vision of the 21st century NHS, involving increased involvement for private contractors and greater freedoms for local managers, chimed very closely with the ideas of the prime minister himself. Mr Milburn's commitment to NHS reforms - including PFI and foundation hospitals - made him a controversial figure on the left of the party, and he clashed with consultants over pay, when they rejected the new contracts he offered them. </p> <p>Mr Milburn's family life has not always been so happy. He split with his first wife, Mo O'Tool, who is now an MEP. He is now, however, happily settled with psychiatrist partner Ruth Briel, with whom he has two sons. Domestic bliss, and the desire the see his children grow up, have not however stopped him answering the call of a return to office.</p>",

  "MPs are to be given a free vote on a bill to ban hunting of foxes with hounds and hare-coursing, the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, announced today. <p>Mr Michael said a date for the Commons debate would be announced tomorrow by the leader of the house, Peter Hain. It is widely expected to take place on Wednesday next week, with a vote the same day. </p> <p>Announcing plans to reintroduce the hunting bill, which was blocked by peers last year, Mr Michael stressed that outlawing hunting was not a priority for the government. </p> <p>But he said the government intended to fulfil its manifesto commitment to enable parliament to settle the issue before the next general election. </p> <p>Mr Michael will ask MPs to agree to postpone the implementation of the foxhunting ban for two years after the bill - which applies only to England and Wales - is passed, in order to minimise the impact on rural communities. But he said it was intended that the hare-coursing ban should come into effect three months after the bill received royal assent.</p> <p>The minister made it clear that the government was ready to invoke the Parliament Act to force the bill through if the House of Lords attempted to block a vote in favour by MPs. That would mean the law would most likely be in place at the time of the next election.</p> <p>The Conservatives immediately signalled their intention to repeal the law if they form the next government.</p> <p>Countryside Alliance chief executive Simon Hart said the news would \"signal an outright assault on everyone who believes in freedom and tolerance\". </p> <p>He added: \"The alliance, its members and supporters, having always acted in good faith, are furious that the government has abandoned its promise to resolve this matter on 'evidence and principle' in an act of political vandalism. </p> <p>\"The wider public will ask how a prime minister who last week pledged that his policies would benefit hard-working families can justify this vicious, prejudiced attack on families across the country. </p> <p>\"The government - and the prime minister in particular - has caved in to the vindictive obsession of its backbench and put hunting above schools, hospitals and pensions in a way that will haunt it up to and beyond the general election. </p> <p>\"A government using emergency legislation to appease its backbenchers is a government in crisis.\" </p> <p>Douglas Batchelor, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the hunting bill is coming back to the House of Commons. </p> <p>\"This heralds the high point of our 80-year campaign to expose fox hunting as a cruel sport and to get it banned. \"We are very concerned, however, at the suggestion that the Government might be asking MPs to vote to delay implementation of the ban by a further period. We simply cannot see any good reason for a delay.</p> <p>\"MPs have made the moral decision that hunting with dogs is unacceptable in a modern society, and this decision should come into effect as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"Hunts do not need a longer lead-in period. They can carry on hunting as long as they take the fox out of the process. </p> <p>\"They can switch very quickly to drag hunting, following an artificial scent. A longer delay than the three months in the original Hunting bill is unnecessary and disproportionate.\" </p> <p>Shadow environment secretary Tim Yeo stiffened the Conservatives' opposition to the government's apparent move to speed through a ban on hunting. </p> <p>He committed a future Conservative administration to reversing the ban. </p> <p>Mr Yeo said: \"If Labour railroad through a bill to ban hunting using the Parliament Act we will introduce a government bill to reverse Labour's ban. </p> <p>\"All Conservatives, front- and backbench, will be allowed a free vote in both houses. The vast majority of Conservatives believe a ban is an infringement of civil liberties and damaging to the countryside.\" </p> <p>Explaining the plan for a two-year delay in implementation of the foxhunting ban, Mr Michael said: \"This period will give those involved in hunting more than adequate time to cease the activities which are to be banned, for humane arrangements, like the dispersal or re-homing of dogs, and for refocusing any business activities on alternatives like drag-hunting or disposal of fallen stock if they wish to do so. </p> <p>\"These welfare considerations do not apply to hare coursing events. Violence and intimidation associated with illegal coursing events is a real and pressing problem in many areas of the countryside today. </p> <p>Mr Michael added: \"The government has condemned threats of illegal action by some supporters of hunting and believes that most people involved are law-abiding people who are prepared to respect the will of parliament. </p> <p>\"Extra time for implementation will make it even clearer that illegal actions and threats or intimidation are totally unjustified. If people wish to continue their opposition to legislation, they have the option of the ballot box through which to express their views.\"</p>",
  "<p>I've just been reading about EA's forthcoming first-person shooter <a href=\"http://www.eagames.com/official/goldeneye/rogueagent/us/home.jsp\">GoldenEye Rogue Agent</a> and have been truly amazed by the developer's efforts to literalise the game title. If you haven't caught the pre-publicity surrounding this game, it works like this: you control a rogue MI5 agent who has lost an eye in a fight with legendary baddie Dr No. Luckily, however, Scaramanga \u2013 the one with three nipples in The Man With The Golden Gun \u2013 rescues the blinded agent and equips him with a robotic cyber-eye, made of gold. Hence\u2026 GoldenEye.</p> <p>But the literal thinking doesn't end there.</p> <p> </p> <p>It turns out that this eye gives your character a range of special psychic abilities, allowing you to chuck baddies around the room with the power of thought alone. But as a necessary gameplay mechanic to limit use, there's an energy bar that runs down whenever the feature is in operation, and you can only renew the bar by performing skill moves. To explain <em>this</em> the designers have come up with the idea that the eye draws on brain energy that is omitted when such moves are performed.</p> <p>This naturalistic approach to game design is admirable, but it runs counter to the 'it just does, okay?' philosophy that quietly underpins videogaming. I'm not just talking about the highly abstract early years \u2013 the hungry yellow circles being chased round mazes by ghosts \u2013 I'm talking about the way games, even today, simply <em>have</em> to break a few rules to function as interactive experiences.</p> <p>Take for example, the abundant health and ammo packs that litter the environments in first person shooters. When a developer tries to really deal with the unreality of this situation, they often end up looking silly. In Resident Evil for example, you were forced to pick up green and red herbs for health \u2013 fine, you might think, herbs are more likely to be littered around an old manor house than first-aid kits. However, how many herbs are there that instantly heal gaping zombie attack wounds?</p> <p>Better still, in Sony's action adventure The Getaway, the player had to recover from bullet wounds by leaning against a wall and having a bit of a rest. Again, it was no more realistic than coming across a magical health pack \u2013 it simply drew more attention to the artifice underpinning the notion of universally available panaceas.</p> <p>GoldenEye looks like it might be a very entertaining game, and EA's decision to let you play as the bad guy is pretty brave for such a mega-corp. But someone needs to tell the marketing chaps to lighten up. No one cared <em>why</em> the original movie was called GoldenEye, and no one will care <em>why</em> the agent they're controlling has a robot eye that must be regularly juiced up by performing special moves. This is the kind of crazy stuff that games ask us to do all the time. If the game is good enough, we'll do it without question. It's best not to draw attention to the absurdities of the videogame universe \u2013 the whole thing might unravel.</p>",

  "<p>When two penniless environmental activists, David Morris and Helen Steel, were sued for libel by the fast-food giant McDonald's, the 313-day trial turned into the longest court case in English legal history. </p> <p>Yesterday, seven years after the action ended in 1997, they took their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg to argue that English libel law and the lack of legal aid for defamation cases - which forced them to represent themselves against a global corporation - denied them the right to free speech and a fair hearing. </p> <p>This time, though, their case, brought against the UK government for breaching the European convention on human rights, was over in little more than two hours, though they will have to wait several months for judgment. For this battle, they had legal aid from the Strasbourg court and a lawyer to put their case. </p> <p>Keir Starmer QC, representing the McLibel Two, told the Strasbourg judges: \"This case is about the rights of two ordinary people without power or wealth to engage in a public campaign on matters of public interest and importance.\" </p> <p>He said English libel law breached the human rights convention because of the stark inequality between ordinary individuals and a massive corporation. </p> <p>McDonald's employed the most expensive lawyers and deployed all the resources of a multinational, while Ms Steel and Mr Morris struggled to argue their case without legal aid or the money to buy the legal expertise they required. </p> <p>Ms Steel, 39, and Mr Morris, 50, were sued by McDonald's for handing out leaflets, which they did not write, titled: \"What's wrong with Mc-Donald's?\" </p> <p>The high court in London ruled that McDonald's had been libelled, and awarded the company \u00a360,000 in damages, later reduced to \u00a340,000 on appeal, which was never paid. </p> <p>The case turned into an expensive public relations disaster for McDonald's when the judge also ruled that the leaflet had correctly accused the corporation of paying low wages, being responsible for cruelty to some of the animals used in its products and exploiting children in advertising campaigns. </p> <p>Mr Starmer told the Strasbourg judges that English defamation law was heavily weighted against the defendants, who had to establish the truth of every statement in the leaflet. This differed from libel law elsewhere. </p> <p>The inequality between the opponents \"could not have been starker\", he said. When the McLibel trial began in 1994, global McDonald's sales were valued at about $18.75bn (\u00a310bn), rising to about $30bn (\u00a316bn) by the end of 1995. </p> <p>\"By way of contrast, during the same period, Ms Steel's maximum income was \u00a365 a week when she was employed as a part-time bar worker, and Mr Morris, a single parent, was unwaged and entirely dependent on income support. The result was that, without legal assistance, the case was under-prepared, unready for trial and was advanced by two inexperienced, untrained and exhausted individuals who were pushed to their physical and mental limits. In short, it was patently unfair.\" </p> <p>Mr Starmer said that to require strict proof of anything contained in social campaign literature \"strikes at the very heart of pluralism, which is the hallmark of democracy\". </p> <p>Philip Sales, for the government, told the judges that the fact that the pair lost their libel battle was not evidence that they had been let down by English libel law or by rules on assistance and access to justice. \"They were given every possible latitude in the presentation of their case.\" he said. \"Indeed, the trial judge went out of his way to a quite extraordinary degree.\" </p> <p>He said campaigning organisations should not be permitted to engage in \"one-sided campaigns of vilification\" beyond the limits of the libel laws which applied to others. </p> <p>Afterwards Mr Morris said he was satisfied with the hearing, claiming the government had been forced to acknowledge that legal aid could be made available for libel cases in exceptional circumstances.</p>",
  "<p>German media giant Bertelsmann, the owner of Europe's largest commercial broadcaster RTL and a potential bidder for the BBC's commercial assets, has built up a \u00a31.35bn war chest and is eyeing acquisitions. </p> <p>Chief executive Gunter Thielen refused to comment on talks with the BBC, which today confirmed it had spoken to Bertelsmann, Disney, Time Warner and other media groups about the future of its BBC Worldwide arm.</p> <p>But he said the company had a \u00a31.35bn war chest at its disposal for potential acquisitions. </p> <p>\"Bertelsmann is steadily increasing its scope for investments to strengthen our core businesses and expand in new growth markets,\" he said. \"We will pursue appropriate opportunities when they become available.\"</p> <p>Mr Thielen's comments came as the German media group, the fourth largest in the world behind Time Warner, Viacom and News Corp, announced its profits had tripled.</p> <p>Profits before interest and tax reached 596m euros in the six months to the end of June, up from 186m euros the previous year. </p> <p>After years of declining sales at the group, revenues at its music unit BMG and television arm RTL Group rose strongly, while cost cuts across the group also helped boost profits, Bertelsmann said. </p> <p>\"In the past two years, Bertelsmann has increased its operating profitability considerably. Our recent consolidation efforts are paying off, and we are back on a growth track,\" said Mr Thielen. </p> <p>The surge in profits will be seen as a vindication of Mr Thielen's \"back to basics\" policy since replacing dotcom visionary Thomas Middelhoff in June 2002. </p> <p>Following the departure of Mr Middelhoff, who cost the company hundreds of millions of pounds pursuing his vision of media convergence, there were a series of divisive management rows over the strategic direction of the family-owned company. </p> <p>Mr Thielen has since promised to concentrate on the group's core publishing, music and television assets, which include a 65% stake in channel Five through its ownership of RTL. </p> <p>Bertelsmann's music division, BMG, which last month merged with Sony Music, had 74m euros in earnings, up from a loss last year, as sales of rose 10% despite the continued weakness of the global music market. </p> <p>Sony BMG, in which Bertelsmann owns 50%, is now the world's second-largest record label, featuring artists including rapper Usher, Britney Spears, Bruce Springsteen and Christina Aguilera. </p> <p>Bertelsmann's Random House unit, the largest US book publisher, got a boost in sales from former US president Bill Clinton's autobiography, and almost tripled earnings to 31m euros. </p> <p>Revenues were also boosted by the popularity of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, which became the biggest-selling adult fiction hardback ever after shifting 2.7 million copies in six months. </p> <p>Magazine publisher Gruner + Jahr lost sales and earnings due to asset sales and spending on new magazines in France. </p> <p>In a Guardian interview today, BBC director general Mark Thompson played down the likelihood of a wholesale sell-off of Worldwide as part of the review of the corporation's commercial activities he ordered in June.</p> <p>However, the fact that the BBC is canvassing views about the future of Worldwide from Time Warner, Disney and Bertelsmann - as well as a number of investment banks - can only fuel speculation the review could lead to a major shakeup of the commercial subsidiary.</p> <p>Among those assets most likely to be put up for sale are the magazines and other ventures that have only a tangential connection to BBC programmes. </p> <p>\"People understand how Top Gear the programme relates to Top Gear the magazine. There's a bit more of a question mark over free-standing enterprises,\" said Mr Thompson. Analysts suggest this could include magazines such as Olive and Eve. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p><strong> March 18 2004 </strong><br> </p> <p> One of the unsettling things about cellular living is that the jail authorities can randomly uproot an inmate at any time and transplant him into a new environment. During my two-year stay at the jail, I have been rolled-up (moved) several times. A new cell equals a new garrison of cockroaches to battle and I have learned to travel armed with AmerFresh Fluoride toothpaste, which blocks cockroach entry points very effectively. </p> <p>On Tuesday our whole pod was moved to a different floor and I used my entire stock of AmerFresh to seal the numerous cockroach-launching points. The new cell was quickly and expertly fortified against the enemy. That night I slept soundly. Little did I know that the jail was about to sabotage my hard work. </p> <p>On Wednesday I was moved back to my original floor and into one of the most cockroach-infested pods in the building. I was completely unarmed and helplessly watched the insects size me up from myriad cracks in the walls. The lights were still on, but I knew that by night time I would be doomed. My new cellmate and I didn't get much sleep, but lay awake watching the legions of cockroaches conquer the room. Whirling around us, they swarmed the floor, the walls, the ceiling, our commissary bags and, finally, our bunks. </p> <p><strong> March 25 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am allowed out of my cell for one hour each day to make a phone call and to take a shower. During my first \"hour out\" in the new pod, I was serenaded by the inmates, who performed a husky version of Yellow Submarine. I was touched by their vocal efforts and their demonstration of high spirits. </p> <p>My new co-habitants are enduring the twin evils of a broken swamp-cooler and a cockroach infestation. They are proving to be the creme de la creme of good sufferers. A neighbouring asthmatic inmate happily described how he inhaled a cockroach that had crept into his nebuliser. He could feel the insect crawling around inside him and promptly vomited his stomach contents. Unfortunately the cockroach was not ejected, as it was lodged in his lung. He was subsequently awarded \"sufferer of the week\" without any real competition. (\"Sufferer of the week\" was an idea of mine that has delighted and distracted my fellow inmates. The title is given to the inmate whom the rest of the pod feel has suffered most.) </p> <p>My cellmate and I have used six tubes of AmerFresh toothpaste and six ounces of Razorless Beard Remover cementing cracks in the walls. The cockroaches still flood our cell every night and I have awoken several times this week to observe my body hair stood up on end and a cockroach crawling on my person. I had previously considered my ape-like fur coating as one of nature's cruel jokes, but now I have discovered that it is a useful defensive shield. </p> <p><strong> April Fool's day </strong><br> </p> <p> My cellmate Mark is stuck at the \"unable-to-eat-the-jail-food\" stage. Approximately three months ago, Mark suffered his first ever arrest, and he has shed 30lbs while in the hoosegow [jail]. His main source of sustenance is the inmate canteen order form, from which he mostly orders Cheez-its, chips (assorted), Granola bars and mixed nuts. Slimmed-down-Mark no longer resembles his booking photo, because he barely touches the jail offerings. </p> <p>Prison inmates who get transferred to the jail joke about how luxurious prison food is vis-a-vis jail meals. (Jail is where unsentenced prisoners are housed and prison is where you go when you are sentenced.) In jail, chow is served twice each day. Breakfast arrives at 8.30am and consists of six slices of stale white bread (the probability of colourful mould growing on a slice is 33%), raw breakfast meat (the probability of it being bologna is 50%, green bologna is 25%), grapefruits or oranges collected during neighbourhood refuse clean-up campaigns (the probability of them being rotten is 50%), one packet of stale and bright orange-coloured, bordering on luminous, cheese crackers, and a beverage, which is a half-pint of fat-free milk. </p> <p>The evening's below-lukewarm culinary delights consist of unsalted boiled potatoes (the probability of receiving a mound of potato peel encrusted with dirt is 25%; of human hair being discovered in the spuds is 25%), mystery meat slop (the probability of a dead rat in the stew is minimal, though I did see a rat's head served in 2002), a vegetable (the probability of leathery eggplant is 25%), a small, undressed salad, more stale bread and a cup of brightly coloured juice, which, if spilled, makes a permanent stain on the table. As I am a yoga-practising vegetarian, I receive peanut butter and veggie burgers as substitutes for the meat. </p> <p><strong> April 15 </strong><br> </p> <p>I received lots of eggs on Easter Sunday: cockroach eggs. I noticed something that looked like a piece of a worm glued to my dictionary. It was full of cockroach larvae. I discovered two more empty egg containers nearby. More nests were discovered in my legal file, and my commissary bag. I poured the contents of one envelope into the toilet, but in the time it took to press the flush button, las cucarachas had scurried out of the toilet bowl and were scrambling around my feet. </p> <p>They were none too happy about their encampment being besieged on a Holy Day, and as darkness came they began to rebel en masse. Numerous baby cockroaches, tinier than ants, started a demonstration. They zigzagged on every wall like minuscule bumper cars. They were soon joined by adult members of their community. One about the size of an almond crawled on to my foot. Several larger ones appeared on the blanket near my right shoulder, and I had to sleep with a sheet wrapped around my head because I feared they had performed a reconnaissance of my upper-body orifices. </p> <p>Mark (my celly) was very disturbed. He stayed awake for most of the night, but when his eyelids finally closed, he dreamed that they were crawling all over him and woke in a terrible sweat, scratching at his body, only to discover that his dream had come true. </p> <p>The law clearly states that \"pre-sentence detainees\" have the right not to live in an insect-infested environment, but the jail continuously flouts the law by showing the external referees their insecticide-spraying records. In fact, the insecticide is sprayed on the inmates and the only effect it has upon the roaches is as a temporary intoxicant. On spray day they act like drunkards stumbling home from the pub, but they quickly sober up. </p> <p>I placed a whole green onion from my dinner tray into a polystyrene cup. I half-filled it with water and, to my delight, it started to grow roots. Now I have a plant of my very own to love and care for! I haven't seen a plant for years! Mark is starting to suspect I've been here too long. </p> <p><strong> April 22 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am a bibliomaniac! I have read 29 books in the last three months, some of which were more than 1,000 pages long. I read for up to 12 hours every day. There are two difficulties associated with being a jailhouse bookworm. The first is bleeding bedsores - I currently have one on my left buttock - and the second is dealing with the mailroom. </p> <p>My first run-in with the mailroom occurred last year when they rejected Security Analysis, a hardback book containing more than 1,000 pages. The mail rejection notification stated that the book was not a book, but actually a \"weapon\". Then last autumn I was denied some Karl Marx. The mail rejection notification stated that I was \"jeopardising the safety of the jail operation\". This past week, I was denied three books that were ordered from <a href=\"http://www.traderspress.com\">www.traderspress.com</a>. The mail rejection notification stated that \"books must be delivered directly from the publisher or online dist [sic]\". As traderspress.com is both a publisher and online distributor, I lodged a complaint, using an inmate grievance form. I was visited by a friendly hearing officer who stated that the mail room officer had made an error and that the jail would accept redelivery. I reordered the books at the cost of an additional redelivery fee and I thought that would be the end of the matter. Unfortunately, the mail room officer had been offended by my complaint and I received a retaliatory, threatening note taped to my Wall St Journal. The note stated: \"You need to contact the Wall St Journal and advise them of your new facility/bunk no. All papers from now on will be thrown away . . . Mail Officer.\" </p> <p>Upon analysing these notices, I have concluded that the mailroom has determined that I am a weapon-seeking revolutionary. The threat to throw away my newspapers seems to be a call to arms. </p> <p><strong> May 13 </strong><br> </p> <p>Frankie, an alleged Mexican mafia contract killer, is the source of most of the hullabaloo in our pod. Last month Frankie was calmly playing cards in a maximum-security pod when an eight-inch shank was suddenly plunged into the back of his neck. Unfazed, he extracted the shank, and was about to return the gesture, when guards pepper-sprayed him, causing temporary blindness. He was consequently promoted to our pod - a super-maximum area, where inmates are confined to tiny two-man cells for 23 hours every day. </p> <p>Frankie looks and acts like Joe Pesci in a mobster movie. He wears his thick, black hair slicked back, and his arms are heavily prison-tattooed. He overcompensates for his Napoleonic height with a cocksure manner, but the inmates have warmed to his lewd wittiness. He has previously served a 17-year sentence, and during that time he became a chess heavyweight. During my one hour out, I usually play a game of chess with him, through his cell window. His piercing hazel eyes and fiendish grin animate his attempts at psychological warfare . . . </p> <p>\"Eat dat fuckin' pawn!\" </p> <p>\"Let me fuckin' teach yer somethin'!\" </p> <p>\"Eat dat fuckin' bishop!\" </p> <p>\"Watch dis! Check! Trick move! What'd fuckin' tell ya!\" </p> <p>\"Don't do it!\" </p> <p>\"Move my bitch (queen) all da way up!\" </p> <p>\"Check-fuckin'-mate! Boo yah!!\" </p> <p>\"Nobody fucks wiv da champ!\" </p> <p>My green onion plant, which had sprouted six inches, suddenly wilted and died. </p> <p><strong> May 20 </strong><br> </p> <p>Hue and cry outside the jailhouse on Saturday morning - a public protest to bring attention to the jail's \"character-building\" conditions. The sheriff's [Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio] swift response was to serve us with tasty mashed potatoes instead of the usual boiled potato peelings. On Sunday night we actually received a scoop of ice cream. Unfortunately, the ice cream was served on top of warm cabbage, causing it to metamorphose into cabbage soup. No matter, we appreciated the gesture, and we are still being served the delicious mashed potatoes. </p> <p>The daily temperatures are now in excess of 38C (100F) and rising. The air is stale and debilitating. On Monday an inmate told a guard that he felt ill and requested medical treatment. The guard told him to drink plenty of water and to lie down. The inmate persisted, stating that he was a diabetic and really needed to see the doctor, but the guard continued to fob him off. On Monday night the inmate slipped into a diabetic coma and was rushed to the hospital. He has not been seen since. </p> <p><strong> May 27 </strong><br> </p> <p>Two more inmates collapsed and were taken to the medical unit. Rumours abound that the diabetic who entered a coma last week may have died, and that the jail is under investigation. We have been told for the past three months that the swamp cooler is \"broken\" and that a \"work order\" has been entered, but, lo and behold, when the county health department inspected the jail on Tuesday and Wednesday, the air was miraculously blowing at gale force and our shower water was running hot enough to redden my skin. When the inspectors left the building someone immediately switched the air back to the \"broken\" setting. </p> <p>I received a large photograph in the mail. It exceeded the 4 x 6 inches allowed by the jail, so I was pleasantly surprised that it was not rejected by the trigger-happy mailroom. It was a picture of a bespectacled President Bush signing some important-looking documents. In the lower margin was a personalised message with my name on it. It read: \"Thank you for your support of the Republican National Committee. Grassroots leaders like you are the key to building a better, stronger, more secure future for our nation and all Americans . . . Best Wishes, George W Bush.\" </p> <p><strong> June 3 </strong><br> </p> <p>In this Hades, intravenous drug use is the hobby of the majority. Dozens of haunted men eagerly play Russian roulette by sharing one \"rig\" (syringe). Deadly diseases, including hepatitis C and TB, are common. The illegal drug use is only half of the story. Three times a day, a crotchety nurse goes from cell to cell dispensing \"meds\". Roughly one-third of the inmates are recipients of these pill cocktails. The most heavily pushed prescriptions are for Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Prozac, Paxil, Haldol, Elavil and Seroquel. </p> <p>The inmates snigger at how easy it is to obtain free drugs. They simply tell the psych doctor that they are \"hearing voices\" or are \"unable to sleep\". The jail's Big Kahuna [Arpaio] regularly appears on TV boasting that it costs the taxpayer a pittance to feed society's refuse, but he never mentions the millions of dollars being spent on expensive \"meds\", which the drug companies are profiting from handsomely. </p> <p>It's been an infernally \"normal week\". Outdoor temperatures are approaching 110F, and we are slowly being brought to the boil. Mark and I now catch one another chasing imaginary cockroaches. </p> <p>The dirty potato peelings are back as the main course among the diarrhoea-inducing expired eatables. Bone-dry citrus fruits are the new additions to breakfast. The stench of filth and sweat pervades the air. The bedsore on my left buttock is blistered and bleeding. My mouth and tongue are ulcerated. This joyless maltreatment is clearly designed to chafe one's happy-go-lucky disposition. The allure of being consigned to the grave can become an unremitting thought, as evidenced by the periodic suicides. </p> <p><strong> June 17 </strong><br> </p> <p> On Friday morning, the guards thwarted an escape attempt by two inmates. Despite the fact that they had botched the job, the jail administration decided to punish everyone. We were placed on \"Security Override\" for four consecutive days, during which we were confined to our cells, unable to shower, make phone calls or dispose of our trash and dinner trays. Soaring temperatures and a purposefully low trickle of swamp-cooled air quickly caused us to stink like wet dogs. </p> <p>Las cucarachas launched the most aggressive offensive that I have ever witnessed. I observed several divisions besiege our cell, consisting mostly of large, brown foot soldiers, a few white colonels, and one pregnant queen, carrying a dreaded baby capsule. </p> <p>The conditions have tipped Eric, a 50-year-old inmate, into a nervous breakdown. Early Monday morning, he started yelling, \"Get me outta here!!!\" repeatedly for 15 minutes. His voice inflection ranged from a demonically possessed adult male - worse than the Exorcist! - to that of a sobbing young child. </p> <p> <strong> June 24 </strong><br> </p> <p> My right shin looks like I have spilled battery acid on it. A skin infection formed last week when we were denied showers and a cluster of approximately 30 bright-red sores has appeared. Some of them are bleeding. </p> <p>Half of the shower area is refusing to drain. Hair matted with semen has clogged it up. To shower I have to step through the odoriferous scum floating in the water. This disturbs a multitude of tiny jet-black flies and they form a cloud around my person. Fortunately they bolt when the shower is turned on, and migrate to the dried fruit peel in the trashcan. When the shower is turned off they return to the shower. They prefer the semen. </p> <p><strong> July 2 </strong><br> </p> <p>Final entry. </p> <p>Periplaneta Americana, more commonly known as the American cockroach, has an average lifespan of 440 days. As of today, I have been a resident of this crowbar motel for almost two cockroach lifespans. I have endured sufficient suffering, and, following in the footsteps of most pre-sentence detainees, I have signed myself over to the prison industrial complex. Shortly, I will be shipped to a Department of Corrections processing facility, where they will decide which state penitentiary is to become my new abode. </p> <p><strong> July 13 </strong><br> </p> <p>I am still at the jail. A sudden spate of tragedies has occurred, compelling me to write this entry. At the weekend two inmates on my floor attempted to commit suicide. One threw himself off the balcony and survived. The other was discovered trying to hang himself. Sadder still, an inmate housed in a medium-security pod was found dead in the shower. Inmates are often \"smashed\" in the shower area because it is out of view of the cameras. The jail has refused to release the cause of his death. </p> <p>The temperature outside is currently 114F. The trickle of air into our cells feels like hot air blowing from a hair-dryer. We are soaked in sweat all day and night. It is difficult to write on this sweat-moistened paper. The majority now have skin infections and rashes, which persistently itch. My skin is so soggy from perspiration that when I scratch it the skin detaches and I end up with clumps of skin under my fingernails. Between the sweat trickling down my body and the cockroaches tickling my limbs, it is impossible to sleep properly. Last night, while sleeping on my side, my ear filled up with sweat, and when I moved my head, the sweat poured out on to my face. I woke up, startled. It felt like someone was touching my cheek. </p> <p>When I was a small child, I imagined that hell consisted of caves in which the damned were trapped, tortured and burned. I imagined serpents and indescribable creepy crawlies tormenting the captives. I never imagined that man's nature could be so hateful as to recreate these conditions on earth. </p> <p>In June, Shaun Attwood pleaded guilty.

  "<p>Air pollution will continue to claim lives in Britain because the air quality targets set for 2005 and 2010 will not be met, Mike Pilling of the University of Leeds told the British Association meeting.</p> <p>London will remain polluted with nitrogen dioxide and particles from traffic and other fossil fuel burning. </p> <p>Roads and main urban centres are likely to remain unhealthy environments. Further problems will blow in from abroad, according to aircraft studies of drifting pollution. </p> <p>He added: \"There are also other changes occurring. Temperatures will increase. </p> <p>\"We saw a big episode during August 2003, a heat wave, and there were something like 2,000 deaths ascribed to that heat. It is clear that perhaps 700 of those were due to the reduction in air quality. </p> <p>\"Changes will take place in the chemistry in the next 60 to 70 years, and in addition we will see increases in the incidence of these heat waves. </p> <p>\"So by 2070 we will be seeing something like a 10-fold increase in heat waves of the sort we saw last year.\" </p> <p>The government aimed to reduce concentrations of small particles of soot and oxides of nitrogen as if they were separate problems, but they should be treated together, he said: the pollutants interacted with each other, and even the abatement measures could interfere with each other. </p> <p>Some measures to reduce nitrogen oxides might lead to increases in ozone, a toxic form of oxygen important in the stratosphere, but a health hazard in the lower atmosphere. </p> <p>\"We need to take these into account as we frame legislation,\" Professor Pilling said. \"There are some complex processes occurring in the atmosphere.\" </p> <p>Moreover, pollution was no longer a local problem: British environmental researchers on a flight in July recorded plumes of carbon monoxide from forest fires in Alaska. </p> <p>\"It's going all the way round the globe,\" Prof Pilling added. \"The Americans suffer pollution from Asia, and we get pollution transported from the US to us. We are exporting to Asia. </p> <p>\"We are not just recipients, but it is clearly affecting the pollution that we experience in this country. We are still at an early stage of understanding what the effects are going to be.\"</p>",

  "When Tony Blair visited Chicago during the Kosovo war in 1999, it was his speech about \"the doctrine of international community\" that attracted the headlines, laying out as it did the framework for a new kind of interventionist foreign policy. But behind the scenes, the trip gave an equally powerful impetus to education policy at home. <p>The words of Chicago's chief education officer, who explained how schooling strategy shaped the city, made a particular impact. \"Where we develop good schools, people want to live,\" he told the prime minister. \"Education drives housing drives retail drives leisure drives environment.\" It was a lesson in sustainable civic regeneration that put new drive into Britain's urban education and the government's Excellence in Cities programme. </p> <p>As schools re-open across Britain, we can celebrate a historic achievement by teachers and pupils. Urban education is improving faster - in some cases much faster - than the national average. The link between class and achievement is being weakened, and in some cases broken. Encouragingly, some of the toughest schools are getting better fastest. The percentage of pupils gaining five or more GCSEs at A-C grades has risen from 13% to 27% at Henry Mellish school in Nottingham, for example, and from 9% to 32% at Birmingham's International School and Community College, which has been taken over by Ninestiles Technology College. At least 40% of students now reach that level in every London borough, compared to as few as 25% in 1997. </p> <p>This is an education revolution, but also a new start for urban policy. Historically, it has been the domain of planning professionals: architects, engineers, designers. Traffic management and shopping centres came first, not the quality of public services. It was this intellectual flaw that fostered those terrible crimes of postwar town planning, the flyovers, dual carriageways and bleak housing estates which devastated Britain's civic fabric. </p> <p>Today, the worst excesses of modernism are receding. The \"new urbanism\" rightly emphasises walkable neighbourhoods, mixed-use environments, high housing densities and historic restoration. But while physical infrastructure is important, human capital is the key to creating vibrant cities. </p> <p>After decades of postindustrial malaise, Britain's cities are finally turning the corner. Although some major cities still lag behind their European counterparts, our urban base has put the nadir of the early 80s behind it. Inner-city residency is now climbing, wages are rising, and there is a tangible sense of civic pride on the back of successful sporting events and cultural redevelopments. But to ensure this renaissance is sustainable, regeneration needs to extend beyond cityscapes and culture to communities and schools. </p> <p>It is a lesson we can learn not just from Chicago, but our own history. Joseph Chamberlain, who helped to transform 19th-century Birmingham into \"the best governed city in the world\", regarded schools as fundamental. His first election was to the local school board. </p> <p>National education reform would have to wait. But after the 1870 Education Act, cities filled the vacuum with infant and \"higher grade\" schools, evening classes and civic universities. These experiments didn't have the power of Germany's commitment to national educational progress, but new forms of teacher training, new syllabuses and keenly fought elections to school-board posts created a powerful system of democratic education. </p> <p>Classrooms became a key part of civic pride. In Birmingham, the architect JH Chamberlain built more than 40 schools in his distinctive gothic styling; London county council progressives favoured a Queen Anne style; the writer Alan Bennett, growing up in 1940s Leeds, recalled seeing \"the arms of the City of Leeds embossed on public library books and on the exercise books we write in at school\". </p> <p>But in the postwar period, educational pride became detached from urban identity. Urban schooling, sometimes unfairly, became a byword for underachievement. By 1994, seven in 10 pupils in our leading cities failed to get five or more passes at higher grades. The curse of underachievement extended to the cities. Low-performing schools led families to leave for the suburbs to secure their children's future. In the 90s, Newcastle lost 5% of its population and Liverpool 7%. </p> <p>None of this is inevitable, as many cities naturally contain unique educational resources - notably in business and culture. But poverty is also higher than average, and there are more families where English is a second language or one parent struggles alone. And in the past, a culture of \"compensation\" rather than ambition was the experience of too many inner-city students. </p> <p>We need, instead, greater urban aspiration. This will require a shift in local government, from being on the back foot explaining poor provision to getting on the front foot as champions of the pupils' interests. That is what Sheffield is doing with its plan for every secondary school to have a specialism. </p> <p>It will mean a shift for central government, too. Its role is not to substitute for school-level decisions, but to ensure there is accountability for those decisions, and effective intervention if things go wrong, or are not going right fast enough. This is the heart of the government's five-year plan, with three-year budgets for every school, enhanced teacher support and wider opportunity for parents and pupils. </p> <p>The culture of aspiration needs the major investment now being committed. But it also demands a culture of no excuses. The case for national testing, for Ofsted inspections, for publication of results, is that objective assessment of school performance is a vital part of the drive to tackle inequalities. If the poorest children get the worst results, that is a reason to change and improve the provision, not avert our gaze. </p> <p>In addition, we need radical innovation in school structures. This is the argument for academies. For the poorest students, in the areas of greatest disadvantage, a new block or a new head or an extra lesson after school is not enough. They need all of this at once: the commitment of resources to change a school's culture, with sponsors ready to bring expertise to the task. Academies are not a threat to the system; they are a source of strength and renewal. </p> <p>The unnatural isolation of schools also needs to be broken down. It means our most successful schools taking over other schools, or being paid to share expertise and teachers. It requires crossing the primary/secondary divide: that is why every specialist school has partnerships with six primaries. It means joining with the wider community to provide new opportunities after school and in holidays. </p> <p>This year, eight cities have improved the percentage of those gaining five or more high grades at GCSE by five or more percentage points, compared to national increases in performance last year of just over 1%. Last year more than 110 schools got fewer than one in five pupils to reach five A-C grades at GCSE; this year that number is expected to halve. </p> <p>Cities rise and fall not on their buildings, but on the fears and ambitions of those who live in them. If our urban regeneration is going to be more than a blip in an inevitable suburbanisation, strong inner-city schooling is vital. Get the schools right, and the rest will follow. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Miliband MP is minister of state for schools; Tristram Hunt is the author of Building Jerusalem: the Rise and Fall of the Victorian City </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ministers@dfes.gsi.gov.uk\">ministers@dfes.gsi.gov.uk</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:tristramhunt@btopenworld.com\">tristramhunt@btopenworld.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When the health secretary, John Reid, gave the go-ahead for a \u00a31bn NHS private finance initiative scheme in north Merseyside last month, he unleashed the largest and most radical transformation of mental health services in the country, a shake-up that tramples all over traditional views that treating mentally ill patients in hospital is good for them.</p> <p>Mersey Care Trust, which provides mental health services in north Merseyside, has a \u00a3147m share of that deal. It plans to use the money to shut all its inpatient psychiatric wards (many of them old and dilapidated) and move services into five new community mental health resource centres.</p> <p>The proposals are nothing if not bold. As Andrew McCulloch, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, says: \"There is no evidence that traditional acute psychiatric inpatient care is good for your mental health, and there is plenty of evidence that it is expensive and ineffective. North Mersey is right at the cutting edge, taking modernisation of mental health services to its logical conclusion.\"</p> <p>Though not everyone in the mental health world is entirely convinced by the plan, it is accepted that the redesign of psychiatric services and buildings is urgently needed, in Merseyside and elsewhere. A report by the mental health charity Mind, published this week, concludes that a high proportion of mental health inpatients in England and Wales experience \"woeful\" hospital conditions, often to the detriment of their health.</p> <p>Mersey Care got a poor rating for the quality of its buildings in the July NHS performance ratings. More than half of its 35 facilities pre-date the NHS; one adult mental health inpatient unit, Windsor House in central Liverpool, is more than 200 years old; and 75% of adult mental health services have been assessed by clinical staff as being so unfit for purpose that only a complete replacement would solve the problems.</p> <p>Elaine Winterbottom, director of service development at Mersey Care, says the design of a building is essential to getting everything else right about people's care. \"Inpatient psychiatric units have inherent design problems that mean staff have to spend a lot of their time trying to avoid risk to patients,\" she says. Putting it bluntly, she says staff spent a lot of time monitoring ligature points to avoid patients attempting suicide.</p> <p>The new buildings will remove these risks, freeing up staff time that will be more productively spent on therapeutic activities and building better relationships with patients.</p> <p>Winterbottom says the main catalyst for change came from service users, carers and other stakeholders, including community organisations and the voluntary sector. She says: \"The messages came loud and clear that they wanted greater choice over methods of treatment, including alternatives to impatient care.\" She criticises traditional inpatient facilities for lacking a therapeutic environment and for being places of observation and custody. \"We are now moving away from the medicalised and hectic environment of the inpatient wards to offer a greater level of choice,\" she says.</p> <p>The establishment of 24-hour crisis resolution and home treatment services has been singled out as the \"single most powerful catalyst for change.\" This means that people in crisis can be supported in the home, where they can be given up to three weeks of intensive support, with three to four visits a day. This will avoid the most common tragedy of inpatient care - that patients are most at risk of suicide in the days following release from hospital, because they don't get enough support in the community. </p> <p>Where pressures in the home are the cause of problems, a secure overnight option - secure for patients, Winterbottom stresses - will be provided in crisis houses, where they will receive intensive support from staff. These will offer single rooms in residential settings. Winterbottom says single rooms are an expensive upfront cost, but they will pay off in the long term, with fewer people being readmitted or needing crisis resolution. Evidence from the US suggests that single rooms get people better faster, and for longer.</p> <p>To meet these new service requirements the trust is undertaking a retraining programme for existing staff and will recruit extra mental health professionals as well as people from the local workforce.</p> <p>Crisis beds in community-based facilities will be provided alongside community mental health teams, early intervention, assertive outreach and crisis resolution teams in order to develop team working across the community.</p> <p>McCulloch says the evidence against traditional inpatient care is too strong for alternatives not to be tested. \"The whole system is wrong because a lot of money is going into services that are poorly targeted,\" he says. \"It is exciting that Mersey Care is leading the way on reforming the system, and it is important we evaluate what it is doing.\"</p> <p>He adds that \"pure psychiatry does not amount to much except medication management in some of our less good inpatient units, and crisis intervention teams can do that at home\". But he accepts that inpatient facilities can still play an important role. \"In practical terms, I would be cautious about getting rid of such places completely,\" he says. \"Even in famous 'bedless' services, such as in Trieste, Italy, there are significant numbers of beds in mental health resource centres.\"</p> <p>McCulloch's view is that the Mersey approach is unlikely to gain immediate widespread acceptance. He says: \"Psychiatrists are the main force preventing us getting rid of our traditional countertherapeutic, expensive psychiatric hospitals, supported by politicians and the public, who believe that dangerous people might be released.\"</p> <p>The Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health is undertaking work to support acute services in developing their inpatient psychiatric services. While the charity was loath to criticise the project, a spokesman pointed out that making traditional inpatient services better was still a viable alternative.</p> <p>Mersey Care, however, is adamant that putting prevention and early intervention at the forefront of service delivery will pay dividends. Winterbottom believes it will allow the trust to get to people before they reach crisis and offer better support when they do. Ultimately, it will improve the mental health of the local community.</p> <p>People have asked for a choice and an alternative to inpatient care, says Winterbottom. It is something they wanted, and now they will get it on an unprecedented scale.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Ward Watch report by Mind is available at <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk\">www.mind.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Park strife (1)</strong><br> National parks are the jewels in the crown of England's fine landscapes, yet there are there 20 large, noisy and destructive quarries operating in them exempt from modern environmental conditions. Moreover, says a new report being launched today by the Council for National Parks, the Countryside Agency and Friends of the Peak District, there are also 33 \"dormant\" permissions that are \"ticking timebombs\". These quarries could be reopened at any time up to 2042, with potentially disastrous consequences for landscape, archaeology and nature conservation in some of the finest countryside. The three organisations are calling on the government to allow far stricter controls and for planning authorities to be able to impose tighter environmental standards.</p> <p><strong>Park strife (2)</strong><br> Meanwhile, the Peak District national park, preparing for the right to roam that is being introduced across more than 100 more sq miles next week, has done one of its regular audits. The second most popular park in the world finds it has a population of around 38,000; traffic has doubled over the past 20 years; native woodland is expanding, though grassland is still under threat; and 72% of its sites of special scientific interest are damaged from overgrazing, moorland fires and air pollution.</p> <p><strong>Unmentionable</strong><br> Guess how many mentions the word \"environment\" got at the US Republican party convention? Not one. And guess how much carbon dioxide Yale University alone emits? According to a new study, more than that of 32 developing countries.</p> <p><strong>Renewed concern</strong><br> The 1970s oil price shocks spurred governments' research into \"alternative\" energy, so how high must the oil price go these days before countries take renewables seriously? Andrew Oswald, economics professor at Warwick University, is not optimistic. \"You'd need to see prices running at $50-$60 (\u00a329-\u00a334) a barrel for over a year.\" According to a report from the International Energy Agency last week, the share of world energy provided by renewables such as hydro and wind power was 5.5% in 2001 - only slightly higher than 4.6% in 1970.</p> <p><strong>GM train derailed</strong><br> Last week, the prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra, took a leaf out of Tony Blair's book and strongly backed GM. \"If we don't start now, we will miss this scientific train and lose out in the world,\" he said. A few days later, his cabinet decided to keep a three-year ban on planting GM crops.</p>",
  "<p>Pick up a newspaper or magazine and it's hard to escape old and new friends of the nuclear industry pleading to be allowed a new start and for Britain to construct more stations.</p> <p>Coupled with this is an apparent softening of political attitudes. Tony Blair has stressed that the \"door isn't closed\" for nuclear, while Tory leader and wind power sceptic Michael Howard is expected to endorse more nuclear power in a speech on the environment next week.</p> <p>There are several reasons for all this activity, the most important being the imminent review of the government's climate change programme (CCP). The UK has ambitious targets to tackle climate change emissions. The energy policy white paper, published last year, recommended that carbon dioxide emissions should be cut by 60% from 1990 levels by 2050, largely through increased renewables generation and energy efficiency. It stated that new nuclear energy was to be put on hold, for at least five years (until 2008), and that any resumption of nuclear investment would need to be preceded by extensive public consultation as well as a further white paper on new-build nuclear power. The realistic earliest a white paper on new-build nuclear could then be published is 2008-9. Add in five years for licensing and planning debates, and another five to eight years for construction, and the earliest that new nuclear generation can be expected is 2018-21.</p> <p>But the white paper conclusions were a setback for the nuclear industry rather than a stake through its heart. Meanwhile, the industry has developed a dual survival strategy: highlighting perceived shortcomings in renewables and setting itself up as a key generator of carbon-free power. The industry wants the forthcoming review of the CCP to reflect these arguments but, since evidence is not on its side, it seems to have opted for a media campaign instead.</p> <p>The recent articles endorsing nuclear power put forward similar arguments. They say Britain needs to reduce its carbon emissions; that all but one nuclear power station will shut before 2020 leaving a gap in the UK's carbon-free electricity generation; that renewable energy is not developing quickly enough; that energy efficiency will not reduce demand sufficiently; and that our growing dependence on natural gas imports is insecure. They go on to say that the only way to ensure climate targets are met and to avoid the lights going out is to build new nuclear power plants.</p> <p>But these arguments do not hold water. Nuclear power may be largely carbon free, but it is not environmentally sustainable. The industry's climate change argument relies on ignoring the radioactive waste problem. More than 50 years after the start of the civil nuclear industry, there is still no clear solution. New nuclear power plants do produce smaller total volumes of radioactive waste than existing ones, but they produce a higher proportion of high-level radioactive waste. Building new stations would mean addressing one long-term environmental problem by exacerbating another.</p> <p>This is the clearest reason why the government should continue to treat renewables and nuclear power differently. Renewable energy has its own problem - in terms of perceived visual intrusion - but this can be managed, for example by appropriate planning guidelines, and is not long term or irreversible.</p> <p>Nuclear power was rejected by the energy white paper as being an \"unattractive option\" on economic grounds, although it's not always clear how expensive it is. To keep existing power plants in use, the government plans to pay for many of British Energy's nuclear waste liabilities, providing a subsidy worth billions of pounds. The deal is subject to approval by the European Commission, but as it stands, the estimated costs to the taxpayer range from around \u00a33.7bn (discounted) to \u00a312.6bn in total, to be spent over some 185 years. Meanwhile, taxpayers are already forking out for past nuclear mistakes, while the industry wants more subsidies to build new nuclear stations.</p> <p>Furthermore, nuclear generation does not fit with the UK's liberalised electricity system. It is inflexible - generating electricity at full power or not at all - and its electricity is expensive when compared with flexible gas or coal plants. New nuclear stations each cost several billion pounds and construction times are long. Investors are reluctant to take on the financial and political risks and any new stations will require direct government subsidy, leading to a move away from competitive electricity markets.</p> <p>Renewables, when compared with nuclear power, are already relatively cheap, and have the potential to become cheaper. The government's own energy models show that individual renewable technologies would be less expensive than nuclear power by 2020. In addition, the total cost of achieving the 60% carbon dioxide cuts would be much lower in a system based on renewables and energy efficiency.</p> <p>Some nuclear closures are inevitable in the short term - the Magnox reactors are already operating well beyond their design lives of 20-25 years. Calder Hall has finally shut down after 45 years. However, although British Energy has a timetable for closing its advanced gas cooled reactors (AGRs), there is nothing to force their closure by those dates. The lifetime extensions for the Magnoxes suggest that the operating lives of the AGRs will be extended too. Thus, the \"generation gap\" created by nuclear closures is not as absolute as the industry claims.</p> <p>Nuclear power has had a fair chance to prove itself over the past 50 years. Building new reactors will not solve the waste problems inherent in the technology nor will it help with meeting international carbon reduction targets. A rational, evidence-based approach is to encourage alternatives that can be cheaper, more flexible, less dangerous and more environmentally acceptable. These exist in the form of renewables and energy efficiency and the government, quite rightly, set those centre stage in the white paper. It must now stand firm behind its policy and ensure their delivery, something it is hoped will be recommended by the climate change review.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Catherine Mitchell is a research fellow at Warwick business school.

  "With its riot of colour in flower-filled borders and fine hanging baskets, coupled with perfectly kept lawns and exotic palms, the Kingston garden would not look out of place at the Chelsea Flower Show. <p>It is, however, enclosed within the 25ft-high walls of a category B prison near Portsmouth and tended by \"gardeners\" serving life sentences.</p> <p>\"A visitor's first impression is a nice sensation of depth, colour and calm,\" says Brian Doe, one of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) judges who have awarded Kingston the Windelsham Trophy for best kept prison garden in England and Wales, its third victory since the trophy was established in 1984.</p> <p>Ten prisoners, under the guidance of agricultural craftsman Jim Dampier, work six hours a day, five days a week, in the garden, which covers every available patch of land around the prison buildings and includes sculptured hedging, beehives and fish and wildlife ponds.</p> <p>While research stresses horticulture's therapeutic qualities, Kingston prison's governor, John Robinson, thinks it creates a pleasant environment for all prisoners and staff and gives the gardeners a sense of responsibility for what they do. \"That's something they've never had before,\" he says. \"And others respect what they've done.

A contract was negotiated with them and we did a lot of advanced technology to make the [enzymes] commercially viable.\"</p> <p>Hutton denies that the two enzymes were blockbusters. \"They have been on the market for four years,\" he says. \"We have sold them to lots of different companies, but the figure is single digit millions, not more.\"</p> <p>He says the biotech company did not pay the Kenyan government or agree to share the financial benefits because it was not the practice at the time. \"It was an in-kind exchange. A woman from Kenyatta University was also on the expedition and we provided the university with some computer and sampling equipment. We helped set up a microbiology department. We did what was customary at the time and what was asked of us by the authorities\", says Huttner.</p> <p>However, under the international Convention on Biological Diversity, governments and companies are committed to a \"fair, equitable sharing of the benefits accruing from ... genetic resources\". The US, which has not signed up to the treaty that came out of the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, is under increasing pressure to sign.</p> <p>There is anger in many developing countries that genetic material is being taken by companies and academics without compensation. \"People come here masquerading as tourists, only to end up taking away some of our valuable resources,\" says Richard Bagine, deputy director of the UN-funded International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology, which is working with the KWS to try to claim money from Genencor and other companies. \"We do not have records showing that the scientists had notified KWS, nor any indication that they had acquired a research permit.\"</p> <p>The research organisation has asked the New York-based Public Interest Intellectual Property Advisors to help find lawyers to represent Kenya.</p> <p>\"Bioprospecting is being carried out across all forms of life,\" says Patrick Mulvany, policy adviser with the Intermediate Technology Development Group. \"Micro-organisms are as valuable, if not more so, than plant genetic resources. It's crucial that there is a fair and equitable sharing of the benefits.\"</p>",
  "Iain Wright, Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for Hartlepool, gives a laughably inaccurate description of my NHS proposals in the recent Orange Book (Letters, September 6) - which does not entirely surprise me in the middle of a byelection campaign. <p>What is depressing is that, in the other letter, Tony Greaves appears to suggest that the agenda of the book is to water down or even throw overboard the social liberal traditions of our party. This is also a complete misrepresentation. When he has had time to read what we have written, he will see that the book wholly embraces our social liberal traditions. The difference between us is only that I believe our economic liberal and social liberal traditions are complementary - that economic liberalism can help to deliver a fairer society. </p> <p>I shall be sending Tony a (free) copy of our book.<br><b>David Laws MP</b><br>Lib Dem Treasury spokesman </p> <p>As a lifelong Liberal Democrat and NHS consultant for 20 years, I welcome David Laws's call for social insurance to replace the current tax-based funding of the NHS. Countries such as France, Germany and Switzerland have far superior health outcomes - negligible waiting lists, better cancer cures and real patient choice - than the UK. By 2007 Britain will be spending the same amount per capita on healthcare as the French - one of the most expensive systems in the world. We will soon see which system delivers more. </p> <p>The poor are reimbursed for the modest up-front charges for healthcare in France. Across the continent the poor receive the same access to high-quality care as the well-off. In the NHS, the least well-off receive the poorest care while the rich opt out. Simply arguing that higher spending plus a bit of tinkering will make the NHS better denies the elephant sitting in the room: a central healthcare monopoly does not work and will not work, even when it has half as much resource again.<br><b>David Wrede</b><br>Doctors for Reform </p> <p> The Lib Dems have enjoyed tremendous success in recent years by adopting a series of progressive and principled policies, which, whether they like the label or not, are to the left of New Labour. There is no other party to put these ideas forward. Fair taxation, free access to education, internationalism and continuing and sustained investment in public services for all people are popular with the majority, many of whom do not vote at present. </p> <p>But unadulterated economic liberalism puts all the above at risk. It links the party with the Tories and puts at risk the support of new found centre-left voters. Any party that appears to be suggesting the abolition of the founding principles of the NHS is doomed to electoral failure - ask the Tories.<br><b>Derrick Chester</b><br>Littlehampton, W Sussex </p> <p>What chutzpah for Iain Wright say Labour can defend the NHS. This government has PFI'd it half to death. New Labour has (with the Lib Dems and Tories) bought completely into the ideology of neoliberalism. It is only a matter of time before global big business tries, through Gats, to gobble up public health services as they already have transport, procurement etc. Who will defend the NHS against this threat? There is now only one serious party that opposes the gradual privatisation (in the name of efficiency and choice) of the NHS - and its name doesn't begin with an L.<br><b>Cllr Rupert Read</b><br>Green, Norwich </p> <p>Iain Wright: manifesto = general election policy commitments (the keeping of which New Labour regard as optional).

  "<p>The former Labour environment minister Michael Meacher yesterday accused a government committee he set up to assess the health effects of low-level radiation of suppressing a report on the possible cause of childhood leukaemia. </p> <p>He called the alleged suppression \"criminally irresponsible\", saying he had formed the committee so as to reflect all opinion on the contentious issue and so that a report could be published putting all the facts before the public. </p> <p>Instead the final report gave a one-sided establishment opinion, he said, which did not \"accommodate a full and fair representation of all views\". </p> <p>Mr Meacher was speaking at the launch of a minority report of the expert committee which says that radiation doses to children across Europe who developed leukaemia could have been up to 100 times larger than suggested by official estimates. </p> <p>The report says that inhaled, man-made, radioactive particles such as Strontium 90 or plutonium from Chernobyl or Sellafield can lodge in the body or foetus and bombard and damage cells. This, particularly in the unborn, would be enough for children to develop leukaemia or other cancers. </p> <p>The National Radiological Protection Board has always measured a tiny dose received by an individual as if it affected the entire body evenly - so the result was a dilution that appeared to do little harm. The possibility that the dose would lodge near a bone or in the brain and emit radiation inflicting localised damage leading to cancer had not been not accepted. </p> <p>Mr Meacher said: \"It is very worrying, for it is hard to conjecture that if the [child] leukaemia peak in Europe was real, anything other than radiation from Chernobyl could have caused it.\" </p> <p>The main report of the expert committee is believed to say that the risks from radiation for leukaemia could be up to 10 times the current estimate. But it failed to mention the theories of the committee members Richard Bramhall and Chris Busby, who examined cancer clusters and concluded that radiation from Sellafield and other nuclear plants could be responsible. </p> <p>Even before the row over the report one nuclear scientist, Marion Hill, who spent 30 years in radiological protection and was part of the committee's secretariat, had resigned alleging establishment bias and exclusion from making reports. She said the regulatory bodies were unable to offer impartial advice to the government on radiation dangers and should be disbanded. </p> <p>Dr Busby said dissenters had not been allowed to defend their views. \"The point is that if we are right then the issue of leukaemia in children caused by radiation is as important as... lead in water pipes and petrol. This should be examined especially if we are about to consider whether a new generation of nuclear power stations is to be built.\" </p> <p>Mr Meacher said: \"The idea was to examine all the questions, and where there was disagreement to recommend further research. It is criminally irresponsible not to allow all the evidence to come out so there can be a properly organised, informed public debate.\" </p> <p>Dudley Goodhead, the committee's chairman, said he was unable to discuss the issue yesterday but would do so at a later date.</p>"
