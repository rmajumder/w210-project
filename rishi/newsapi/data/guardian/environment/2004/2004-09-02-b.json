  "The Kremlin yesterday adopted a delicate approach to the hostage crisis in southern Russia as it attempted to square its fierce anti-terrorist rhetoric with the need to pander to a nation desperate for a bloodless resolution. <p>In his first public remarks on the biggest challenge of his tenure, President Vladimir Putin hinted at softly-softly tactics to defuse the explosive situation in the North Ossetian primary school, promising to put the lives of the more than 300 hostages first. </p> <p>\"Our main task is, of course, to save the life and health of those who became hostages,\" Mr Putin said. At the same time, he said, he would not allow the drama to destabilise further the precarious balance in the North Caucasus, a region home to myriad ethnic tensions. \"We understand these acts are not only against private citizens of Russia but against Russia as a whole,\" Mr Putin said in comments broadcast on Russian television. \"What is happening in North Ossetia is horrible.\" </p> <p>Security officials warned against expecting a swift denouement to the stand-off, while reassuring the public there were no plans for a potentially bloody military operation to storm the school. \"One should expect long and tense negotiations,\" the North Ossetian federal intelligence service chief, Valery Andreyev, was quoted by ITAR-TASS as saying. </p> <p>Mr Putin won support from the international community. The UN security council issued a statement expressing determination to combat \"all forms of terrorism\", a move that gives Russia a measure of support for its own fight against terror. The president may need it. Though Russia has suffered several mass hostage crises in the last 10 years, the Beslan drama is potentially the most catastrophic. \"President Putin faces the most difficult decision in the whole of his presidency,\" the daily Izvestia trumpeted yesterday. </p> <p>The vast majority of those held are children and television images have struck a raw nerve here. Parents across the country took part in similar back-to-school festivities on Wednesday. </p> <p>Few will want to see Russian forces storm the school, knowing how high the risk is that scores of children and teachers may die in the confusion. The effect could be especially grim politically for the Russian president. The last big hostage seizures, in the Dubrovka theatre in Moscow two years ago, and in a hospital at Budyonnovsk in 1995 took place in cities where Russians are in the majority. For all their anger at the high death toll (at Dubrovka 129 civilians died, at Budennovsk 130 civilians and 36 troops and police were killed), people reacted phlegmatically, accepting it as part of the tough environment in which they have always lived. </p> <p>Beslan is different. In the Caucasus, people are not so forgiving of official Russian blunders. If precipitate actions by Russia's special forces produced high casualties, the public mood could turn sour. It would not produce sympathy for the Chechens, but it could move Ossetians into an attitude of \"a plague on both your houses\". </p> <p>Using the knockout gas employed to end the theatre siege in Moscow is scarcely likely. The gas not only incapacitated all the hostage takers. It killed scores of their victims. </p> <p>One difference with the Moscow theatre siege could help Mr Putin, provided he was willing to negotiate. A key demand of the hostage takers is that Russia release the dozen or so gunmen arrested and imprisoned after a Chechen raid on several police stations and posts in and around Nazran, the capital of Ingushetia, in June. </p> <p>To release these people and let the Beslan hostage takers have safe passage out, if they end the school seizure peacefully, is feasible since they could be guaranteed safe travel to Chechnya within little more than an hour. </p> <p>The difficulty for the Russian president is that he continues to rule out all talks with the militants, trying instead to link the Chechen war with \"international terrorism\". </p> <p>If his aim is to get official western sympathy, he is successful. This week France's President Jacques Chirac and Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der publicly supported his line on Chechnya. President Bush has also muted all criticism of Russian tactics in Chechnya. But what makes for successful foreign diplomacy does not solve Russia's domestic problem - how to end a war which has gone on for five years under Mr Putin's presidency. </p> <p>Mr Putin has little to fear from a disastrous outcome to the siege. He has been elected to a second term in the Kremlin. But he could suffer damage to his image as a tough and competent leader.</p>",
  "For the second time in a week, Vladimir Putin was forced to interrupt his Black Sea holiday yesterday and rush back to Moscow to deal with a horrifying terrorist outrage linked to the crisis in Chechnya. <p>Like last week's bombing of two Russian passenger airliners, the school hostage siege in North Ossetia caught the Russian president on the hop. It follows closely on the heels of Tuesday's suicide bombing in Moscow and a string of other incidents in Chechnya and Ingushetia. </p> <p>This dramatic surge in Chechen separatist violence threatens to draw Mr Putin into what could become, in effect, a third Chechen war - with the alarming possibility of a wider Caucasus conflagration. </p> <p>His predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, miserably failed to suppress Chechen nationalism through military intervention from 1994-96. Three years later, Mr Putin, then prime minister, plunged into a second conflict which he used to boost his presidential credentials. </p> <p>Mr Putin declared victory in early 2000 and again in mid-2002 - but like President George Bush, who prematurely announced \"mission accomplished\" in Iraq, Mr Putin has been repeatedly made to look weak and foolish by the Chechen rebels. </p> <p>That is a dangerous way to treat the former KGB hard man and judo fan. Even at the best of times, Mr Putin's tolerance for opposition or dissent is limited. If provoked, he hits back. Yet now, despite his hurried return to base, it is unclear what he can do beyond resolving the immediate crisis in North Ossetia. Mr Putin refuses to countenance negotiations in Chechnya; the use of force has demonstrably failed; and his political machinations, including last weekend's bogus presidential election to replace an assassinated pro-Moscow placeman, are counterproductive. </p> <p>In July, in apparent exasperation, Mr Putin sacked three of Russia's most senior generals, including Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the general staff, over the setbacks in Chechnya. But this has simply led to the Kremlin being more intimately associated with continuing humiliations in the region. </p> <p>Considered more broadly, the overall authority of a man whose approach to governance is increasingly authoritarian is under challenge on a range of fronts and not just in the Caucasus. </p> <p>Mr Putin won a second term by a landslide last March, largely by denying media access to rival candidates. His message was that he alone could provide Russians with security and stability after the chaos of the post-Soviet Yeltsin era. Above all, Mr Putin presents himself as a safe pair of hands. </p> <p>But there have been several fumbles of late. Terrorism apart, Mr Putin has faced unusually vehement public protests since March over cuts in longstanding social benefits, including housing subsidies, free public transport and prescriptions. </p> <p>His stated aim of doubling Russia's GDP has begun to look as far-fetched as his claim to have whipped the Chechens. Amid open cabinet bickering, his finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin, complained recently that economic reforms have been \"screwed up\". And then there is the Kremlin's long-running, destabilising vendetta with Yukos Oil. </p> <p>While Mr Putin's strongman image may be wearing thin at home, foreign criticism is also on the increase. </p> <p>In an open letter to President Jacques Chirac of France and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, last month ahead of their talks with Mr Putin, Human Rights Watch deplored abuses of press and academic freedoms in Russia and attacks on non-governmental organisations. </p> <p>It also urged France and Germany to act over Mr Putin's \"failure to establish a meaningful accountability process for crimes committed by Russian soldiers and police forces [in Chechnya]... enforced disappearances, summary executions, and torture have grossly undermined trust in Russian state institutions among ordinary Chechens.\" This caused people such as last week's \"black widow\" plane bombers to resort to violence, it suggested. </p> <p>According to Amnesty International, \"Russian security forces continue to enjoy almost total impunity for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Chechnya\". Continuing excesses by Chechen fighters, like the Ossetia siege, were also strongly condemned. </p> <p>In truth, it sometimes seems that the only people not criticising Mr Putin these days are western governments. Mr Chirac and Mr Schr\u00f6der endorsed Sunday's sham election and sidestepped human rights issues. The Foreign Office, like the US state department, sticks to cautious formulas expressing \"concern\" and fond hopes for better, more democratic days. </p> <p>This attitude has many explanations. Among them is the fact that the US wants Russian support for its own \"war on terror\", so a blind eye is turned in Chechnya. Another reason is the US-British requirement for Moscow's acquiescence over Iraq (and Palestine). And then there is oil. </p> <p>Russia is an energy giant whose importance as a global supplier is increasing rapidly. It is the world's largest exporter of natural gas and second largest exporter of oil after Saudi Arabia. Put crudely, the west needs Russia. And it believes Mr Putin can deliver. End of story.</p>",

  "<p>Escapist Hollywood movies are benefiting from the current sense of global crisis, the film-maker Steven Spielberg said yesterday. </p> <p>Speaking as his new film The Terminal launched the Venice film festival, Spielberg said: \"Hollywood has always been there, either to reflect the crisis with very conscientiously minded stories or with films of pure escape - science-fiction, fantasy, comedy. These films typically work much better when the world is in flux. </p> <p>\"The world has shown us that people need relief from the headlines ... sometimes we do feel compelled to escape into the movies.\" </p> <p>Whether Spielberg himself will be providing audiences with the escapism they crave is a moot point. His next film is going to be a contemporary adaptation of HG Wells's The War of the Worlds, just the type of material to set US audiences in a state of nervous frenzy at a time when fear of terrorism is at its zenith. Then he is likely to make his film about the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics and how Mossad tracked down the Palestinians responsible for killing the Israeli athletes. </p> <p>The Terminal, meanwhile, is based on the real-life plight of an Iranian traveller who has spent years in limbo at Charles De Gaulle airport. Spielberg claims a personal affinity with the subject matter. In 1978, he said, he was caught in a snowstorm at Kennedy Airport. \"I wound up spending 24 hours sitting in the airport and standing in a three-hour line to go to the bathroom.\" </p> <p>The Saving Private Ryan director is spearheading a mini-Hollywood invasion of Venice this year. Other big budget films screening there include Michael Mann's Collateral and Jonathan Demme's The Manchurian Candidate - prompting critics to accuse the festival of becoming too accommodating to the US studios. </p> <p>New Venice festival director Marco Mueller yesterday dismissed the accusations, however, revealing that he has also been accused this year of \"Maoism\" for programming political pictures and of \"trashiness\" for showcasing Italian B-movies.</p>",
  "<p>Cazenove, one of Britain's most prestigious independent investment banks, and JP Morgan, the US banking giant, today declined to comment on reports of a possible joint venture.</p> <p>The Financial Times reported that the two banks are in talks that would effectively fuse the British brokerage with the US group. Citing people close to the talks, the FT said the deal would boost JP Morgan's presence in the City, while allowing Cazenove, worth an estimated \u00a3750m, to align itself with a larger global institution without giving up its independence. </p> <p>In June, Cazenove reported a sharp rebound in annual profits and confirmed that it was examining several \"outline\" takeover bids. But it provided no details on how that progress was going.</p> <p>Robert Pickering, Cazenove's chief executive, said at the time that the brokerage had to assess whether it could benefit by linking with a bigger firm while preserving its unique culture. The bank also said flotation was an option.</p> <p>Cazenove, broker to half the companies in the FTSE 100 blue chip index, has been linked to Lehman Brothers and to Barclays, but the UK bank backed away from plans to make a bid in June. The FT said the talks with JP Morgan, which recently acquired Bank One, would involve the US bank joining some of its UK operations with the 180-year-old Cazenove in a venture in which the latter's partners would retain an equity stake. </p> <p>JP Morgan, which lacks a major presence in UK corporate broking, was tipped as a suitor in 2002, but Cazenove said it was not for sale. Observers said a link-up between Cazenove and JP Morgan was plausible because of the US bank's weakness in London, although whether it would be a productive deal was another matter.</p> <p>\"JP Morgan is still trying to enter the ranks of the more qualified institutions in equity derivatives and cash equity, with particular weakness in London, so they might plausibly think Cazenove could help,\" said one analyst. </p> <p>\"But I can't see Cazenove co-existing productively inside any larger institution, and much less an American one. JP Morgan is one of the more wasteful acquirers in US banking and Cazenove will be a graceful waste of money so it fits the bank's spirit well.\"</p>",
  "Nine books of \"maturity and accomplishment\" - ranging in theme from the story of Noah's ark retold with one-line postmodern jokes, to the Russian Jewish enclaves of modern Toronto - vie with each other in the opening stage of the Guardian First Book award today. <p>The longlist for the \u00a310,000 award, intended to recognise and reward writing by first-time authors, is made up of four books of fiction, four of non-fiction, and one volume of poems. </p> <p>Five of the chosen authors are British, two American, one Dutch, and one Canadian of Latvian origin. Their subject matter is even more heterogeneous. </p> <p>The fiction features stories of love and loss, magic and mystery, and the pain and joy of immigration, as well as the new take on Noah. </p> <p>The non-fiction looks at the intertwined lives of American writers, the reality of global warming, the genetic make-up of the human body, and a journey on foot across Afghanistan. </p> <p>The chair of the judging panel for the award, the Guardian's literary editor Claire Armitstead, said last night: \"We had a bigger submission this year than ever before - 145 books. </p> <p>\"Since we only allow three books per [publisher's] imprint, this gives some idea of how much energy publishers now put into spotting and producing new writers. In fiction, it seems to have been the year of old-fashioned narrative. </p> <p>\"Whereas in previous years there has been a lot of playfulness with form, this year's entry seems to show a return to solid, reader-friendly writing. The strongest sector was probably short stories, where there were three or four excellent collections. </p> <p>\"The age profile of the longlisted writers is higher than in previous years, which may account for the maturity and accomplishment of the books.\" </p> <p>The other judges include: the novelists Hari Kunzru and Ali Smith, the author and academic Lewis Wolpert, the barrister and cultural critic Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, the theatre director Sir Richard Eyre, the author and comedian Alexei Sayle, and the Guardian's deputy editor, Georgina Henry. </p> <p>Unusually for a literary award, readers' groups from Waterstone's bookshops in London, Glasgow, Nottingham, and Manchester will be able to affect the outcome. Stuart Broom, of Waterstone's, will represent their views on the judging panel. </p> <p>Mr Broom said: \"Involving our customers in reading groups actually puts them at the centre of the process of championing new authors. Readers involved in the 2003 award found it incredibly rewarding, and it was fascinating to note the differences in opinions voiced by readers of different ages in different cities which we were able to throw into the mix at the judges' final meeting.\" </p> <p>The shortlist will be announced in early November, and the winner of the prize in December.

  "<p>Struggling telecoms equipment maker Marconi today took a giant step towards recovery as it announced the early repayment of \u00a3669.5m of debt following its restructuring last year.</p> <p>The money was paid well ahead of the 2008 deadline set by creditors, and will save Marconi \u00a355.8m in annual interest charges.</p> <p>\"The early paydown of all of our restructuring debt is an excellent achievement,\" Mike Parton, the Marconi chief executive, said. \"We have emerged with a strong balance sheet, and can now fully focus our efforts on growing our business.\"</p> <p>Today's repayments follow better than anticipated returns from the sale of businesses and improved trading performance at the company. </p> <p>Following an increase in confidence among telecoms customers, Marconi announced its first quarterly profits for three years in May. </p> <p>Last month, the improved trading performance enabled three directors, including Mr Parton, to raise almost \u00a39m from cashing in options granted after they met performance targets, including those for debt reduction. </p> <p>Marconi staved off collapse in May last year thanks to a restructuring in which banks and bondholders agreed to write off most of the company's debt in return for control. Shareholders saw their holdings virtually wiped out. </p> <p>The near-collapse of the company was one of the most spectacular in British corporate history. Formerly GEC, Marconi was an industrial giant built up by Arnold Weinstock, one of Britain's premier industrialists. At its zenith, it was worth more than \u00a330bn.</p> <p>Problems began when Lord Weinstock's successor, Lord Simpson, decided to focus on telecommunications, selling profitable defence businesses and dropping the name GEC in favour of Marconi.</p> <p>Marconi ran into trouble three years ago when the hi-tech bubble burst.

  "<p>A British Council official who assumed a pseudonym to write Sunday Telegraph articles attacking \"the black heart of Islam\" has been sacked. </p> <p>The government-funded body, which recently commissioned a handbook on Islam \"to prevent ignorant comments about Muslims being made in [the] national press\", said yesterday it had dismissed Harry Cummins, a senior press officer, after an internal investigation. </p> <p>The author's identity was unknown to all but the Sunday Telegraph's executives until it was revealed by the Guardian's diarist, Marina Hyde, four weeks ago, prompting a flood of complaints to the council from Muslim groups. </p> <p>In his four articles, bylined Will Cummins, he compared Muslims to Nazis and argued that Muslim voters have a \"global jihadi agenda\". One of his articles stated: \"All Muslims, like all dogs, share certain characteristics.\" Another argued: \"It is the black heart of Islam, not its black face, to which millions object.\" </p> <p>The author also compared voters in Leicester and Birmingham to the Janjaweed militia who have committed atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan and claimed that Islam was \"sanctified by the principle ... that any civilisation, however repulsive, has the same value as any other\". </p> <p>In a statement, the British Council said: \"Following allegations that a British Council employee had written a series of articles in the Sunday Telegraph offensive to Islam, an investigation has been carried out and a British Council officer has been dismissed.\" </p> <p>The dismissal was welcomed by the Muslim community, which said the comment pieces had incited racial and religious hatred. </p> <p>Murad Qureshi, a Muslim activist and member of the London assembly, said: \"The British Council was right to move swiftly against something which threatened to reflect so badly on the work it does globally. This was a huge issue for us. But there remains the problem that we rely on the goodwill of public bodies. What we need is legislation which will stop these vicious and pernicious attacks.\" </p> <p>Abdul Bari, deputy secre tary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said the British Council had \"acted swiftly and decisively to distance themselves from the poisonous hatred espoused by Mr Cummins\". </p> <p>An MCB spokesman added: \"We have always insisted that there is a world of difference between criticising a faith and actually inciting hatred of its followers. Harry Cummins had clearly crossed this line.\" </p> <p>The affair has severely embarrassed the council. Last year, Mr Cummins helped to promote a seminar \"to debate press freedom and responsibilities with emerging and potential Muslim leaders\". </p> <p>After the Guardian revealed that Mr Cummins was the author of the Sunday Telegraph articles, the council voiced concern that his writings and the resulting furore might hamper its work. A spokesman described the pieces as \"the antithesis of everything that we stand for and have worked to achieve over 70 years\". </p> <p>Mr Cummins, who had denied that he was the author, was unavailable for comment yesterday. </p> <p>Nor was anyone available for comment at the Sunday Telegraph. But the articles have been publicly criticised by another writer on the paper. Columnist Jenny McCartney said of Mr Cummins: \"He is not a man to let the facts get in the way of his vigorous pursuit of a bad argument. Inaccuracies and distortions abound.\"</p>",
  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, today launched the first project in Europe to use satellites to track paedophiles and other criminal offenders. <p>Mr Blunkett launched the initiative, which uses a new generation of electronic tags, in Manchester. He described it as a \"prison without bars\" that can pinpoint an offender's position to within six and a half feet.</p> <p>A pilot programme using the satellite-linked technology will involve up to 120 offenders being tagged across three trial areas - Manchester, the west Midlands and Hampshire. </p> <p>If the trial is successful, the new generation tags could be fitted to thousands of offenders across the country. The technology is being used to track sex offenders, domestic violence offenders and prolific offenders. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said the pilot scheme would ensure the system was \"robust and reliable\" and it would be expanded \"as soon as possible\". </p> <p>\"The public have to be confident that this 'prison without bars' works, and that it gives the police and probation services the tools they need to protect them,\" he said.</p> <p>Ministers have put aside \u00a33m to cover the cost of the 12-month project, which is thought likely to cost an average of \u00a368 a day per offender. It uses global positioning system satellites, backed, in some cases, by mobile phone technology, to monitor offenders' movements. </p> <p>The system will sound an alarm if, for example, a tagged paedophile entered an area from which he or she had been banned, such as a playground or school, alerting police. </p> <p>Offenders will be tracked following their release from jail or as part of a new community penalty, the exclusion order, which courts can impose to prevent an offender from going to specific locations. </p> <p>It will also be used as part of existing intensive supervision and surveillance programmes for persistent juvenile offenders. </p> <p>Two types of satellite tracking will be tested in the pilot scheme. Passive tracking allows an offender to be monitored retrospectively, with location data being downloaded at certain times during the day. </p> <p>Hybrid tracking monitors offenders in \"real time\" if they enter an exclusion area, with their location appearing on an ordinance survey map, enabling appropriate action to be taken. </p> <p>The pilot scheme was first announced in July as part of the Home Office's five-year crime plan. It is part of a series of measures intended to meet a government pledge to cut offending by 15% by April 2008.</p> <p>Paul Cavadino, the chief executive of crime reduction charity Nacro, said satellite tracking was \"very intrusive\", but could be justified in some cases of serious or prolific offending. </p> <p>He said the technology could be particularly useful in ensuring that sex offenders stayed away from school playgrounds, but added: \"It should not become routine in less serious cases, where it would be a disproportionate response.\"</p> <p>Mark Leech, the founder of the national ex-offenders' charity Unlock, and the editor of the Prisons Handbook, said: \"Heralded as a breakthrough it may be, but the reality is that this pilot will cover 0.1% of the 120,000 prisoners released each year.\"</p> <p>The prisons minister, Paul Goggins, stressed that the system would only reinforce existing arrangements, and would not lead to offenders leaving prison early. </p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It will be a constant reminder [to offenders] ... that we are watching them, we know where they've been, we know what they are doing and if they stray, we will act to stop them.\" </p> <p>However, concerns were also voiced about the scheme's cost. \"This will prove to be a very expensive resource and therefore must be limited to those offenders that pose the highest risk of harm to the public,\" Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of probation union Napo, said.</p> <p>\"It's also critical that it's not used as a substitute for treatment, supervision and surveillance.\"</p>",
  "Thank you for coming. It's always a great pleasure to be here at Chatham House. <p>A year ago, Kofi Annan summed up what many were thinking when he spoke of the United Nations \"at a fork in the road\". There was a feeling that collective action had failed, and that the Organisation's future was at stake. On one side were accusations of unilateralism. And on the other was the conviction that our collective security was being threatened in new ways, with an insufficient collective response being offered. </p> <p>It was clear that we needed to build a new consensus. The High Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General has the task of proposing how that consensus might look; and I look forward to its conclusions. Let me offer some remarks today from a British perspective.</p> <p>In asking how the United Nations can adapt for the future, it is worth looking first at what lessons we can learn from its past.</p> <p>After the Charter was signed in 1945, the New York Times warned that it \"can be either the soul of a brave new world or merely a scrap of paper, depending on the will and action of its creators\". That \"will and action\" has varied over the UN's 60-year history. During the Cold War, although it did do some major work such as the resolutions on the Middle East, the Council was hampered by the superpower stand-off. In the whole period until 1990, it adopted only 17 Chapter VII resolutions. But today, the Council is the scene of remarkable international collaboration: it has adopted 24 Chapter VII resolutions over the last year alone. The UN's founders were well aware that they had not created an organisation fixed in stone: President Truman, at the signing ceremony, said \"no-one claims that [the Charter] is now a final or a perfect instrument\". But change has, in fact, come about not through revision of the Charter text, but by making flexible use of the instruments which it established. UN peacekeeping, for example, is nowhere mentioned in the Charter, but it has been one of the Organisation's great successes. Since they won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988, the \"blue helmets\" have helped to bring peace and democracy to countries such as Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique and East Timor, and continue to maintain stability from Haiti to Sierra Leone to the Ethiopia-Eritrea border. </p> <p>So its history shows that the United Nations is an effective tool for action when - though only when - its members have the political will to use it. And it shows too that the Organisation is a flexible instrument which is able to adapt - though again, it has done so when and only when its members have been willing to drive that change. </p> <p>The UN will need the same political commitment if it is successfully to adapt today. And it is vital that we build such a commitment to change, because the nature of the threats which we face has evolved, and because they demand collective and global responses.</p> <p>Today's threats are as likely to come from non-state groups such as terrorists and criminals as from states themselves. And they affect us all. The terrible siege at the school in Beslan, in the Russian Federation, shows again that terrorists are prepared to attack anyone, anywhere, without a shred of human compassion. The trauma for those poor innocent children is unspeakable, the anxiety for their parents unimaginable. Their suffering is our suffering. The awesome responsibility of President Putin and his Government is our responsibility too: first, out of simple human compassion and natural solidarity with the Russian people, whose sacrifice in the second world war helped secure our peace and future as well as theirs; but also, because this barbarism unfolding across the world's television screens is a horrible reminder that international terrorism is a present danger to all of us, wherever we are. The Security Council last night was therefore absolutely correct, in calling for the unconditional release of the hostages, to reaffirm that terrorism is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. </p> <p>It is not only terrorism within one state which has to be the concern of the international community as a whole, but other conflicts too. The situation in Darfur, from where I returned last week, demands action both because it is a human tragedy, and because it affects the whole region through the spread of instability and the movement of refugees. And in Gatumba, in Burundi, the horrific massacre a few weeks underlines the continuing potential of that conflict to destabilise the Great Lakes, and the challenges which the UN force there has to face. </p> <p>Those conflicts also show how threats to our security today are often linked to a range of factors such as the breakdown of order, poverty, disease, crippling injustice, environmental degradation and climate change. Unless we tackle such issues, we will not be able to build long-term, sustainable global security. The modern security agenda demands new and wide-ranging forms of collective action. And the United Nations is uniquely fitted to deliver them. The UN alone offers the global reach which is needed, and has the international standing and legitimacy to bring the international community together, developed and developing countries alike.</p> <p>It is beginning to fulfil that role. Over the past years, the Security Council has expanded the range of issues which it determines to be threats to the peace - covering the overthrow of democratically-elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe, refugee crises, and states which flout their international obligations on weapons of mass destruction. It has also considered uncontrolled small arms flows and the HIV-AIDS pandemic. </p> <p>We now need to take that evolution further, with the Council beginning to treat such issues more consistently, and as a matter of course, rather than in the relatively ad hoc way in which it has done so to date. That means that we need to continue to build a shared understanding of the nature of the modern threats to international peace and security.</p> <p>And alongside that, we also need to develop a greater consensus on how we can collectively address those threats. Let me highlight three areas for discussion.</p> <p>First, we need to be able to act earlier, as threats emerge; and our action needs to be sustained.</p> <p>To encourage a quicker response to emerging threats, the Secretary General could consider making more use of his power, under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and security to the Security Council's attention. But no Secretary-General could do this in a vacuum, nor at the risk of being embroiled in an argument among Security Council members. So the UN's member states, not least the members of the Security Council, also have to face up to their responsibilities. Despite the warnings from United Nations staff this Spring of looming catastrophe in Darfur, and active efforts by the UK to draw international attention to the situation, it took the Security Council until the end of July to agree a resolution. Member States need to provide the UN Secretariat with the analytical capability it needs, and act on its warnings.</p> <p>We also need to ensure that international action is co-ordinated and sustained, particularly in post-conflict societies. Although the success of Namibia or Mozambique shows what can be done, countries emerging from civil conflict may relapse back into it within only a few years. Duplication of effort or competing programmes and priorities can be fatal to such fragile societies - if, for example, economic reforms cause high unemployment, and that coincides with the demobilisation of large numbers of battle-trained soldiers. So the United Nations needs to ensure that its own agencies work together, in pursuit of common objectives, with a clearer division of responsibilities; and it also has the wider potential to act as a co-ordinator of other international efforts and programmes. </p> <p>The second area which I want to highlight is the need to develop more effective tools for collective action. </p> <p>On terrorism, we need to maintain the recent momentum created by Resolutions 1526, on sanctions against Al-Qa'ida, and 1535, on the Counter-Terrorism Committee; and to put those Resolutions' objectives into practice. On the spread of small arms and light weapons, we should build greater international support around the UK's Transfer Control Initiative, aimed at securing agreement, at the UN Review Conference on small arms in 2006, to curb the export of such weapons to countries where they can fuel conflict or the abuse of human rights. </p> <p>We should also look to strengthen the UN's growing relationships with regional organisations. Chapter VIII of the Charter was remarkably visionary in nature, drafted at a time when few regional organisations existed; today, the Security Council could make more use of it. The UN has the potential to act as a clearing-house for the exchange of resources and capabilities - for example, facilitating NATO airlift support for an African Union operation, or deploying a European Union policing contingent as part of a force of UN-led peacekeepers. </p> <p>Perhaps the most sensitive question in the debate about the tools at our disposal is that of collective intervention in another state - including, in the most extreme cases, the use of military force. But it is a discussion which we need to have. </p> <p>A journalist [E.B. White] at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 wrote that underneath all the talk of collective security could be heard \"the throbbing of the engines: sovereignty, sovereignty, sovereignty\". There was no sense that the new Charter had removed the Westphalian principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs which lay at the basis of the international system. </p> <p>But equally, all members of the United Nations have accepted some limitation on their power to do as they please, in the service of collective security. It can no longer be acceptable to classify situations such as that in Darfur, or before in Rwanda or Kosovo, as simply the concern of one national government. States have the right to non-interference in their internal affairs; but they also have responsibilities, towards their own people, and towards the international community and their international engagements. Where those responsibilities are manifestly ignored or abused, the international community may need to intervene: the cost of failing to do so in Rwanda still haunts us today. So we are, correctly, not allowing the Sudanese Government to regard the situation in Darfur as a sovereign matter which is none of the world's business - but instead, we are putting pressure on that Government to meet its responsibility to provide security for its people. We are now giving active consideration to the Secretary General's report on the situation which issued yesterday.</p> <p>In the most extreme cases of crimes against humanity or humanitarian catastrophe, such as in Kosovo in 1999, international intervention may also have to include the use of military force. Such action will always be a highly sensitive topic in the international community, and rightly so. But there are some signs that a consensus is beginning to emerge. We need now to build on that - for example by restarting discussion on the basis of the guidelines for humanitarian intervention which the Prime Minister first proposed in 1999. </p> <p>And the debate is also evolving in the face of today's threats to international security. In the wake of the September 11th 2001 attacks, the Security Council recognised that large-scale terrorist action could constitute an armed attack that will give rise to the right of self-defence; and that force might, in some circumstances, be used against those who plan and perpetrate such acts and against those harbouring them, if that is necessary to avert further such terrorist acts. It was on that basis that the United Kingdom participated in military action against Al Qa'ida and the Taleban in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Alongside the debates on humanitarian intervention and action in self-defence, we also need to start building a consensus around the broad criteria for action by the Security Council against threats to international peace and security. We can build there on the growing understanding that these threats are wider, and different in nature, than before. On all of these questions and many others, the UN will be at its most effective when it promotes the widest possible international collaboration. So we also need to address the question of broadening the membership of the Security Council itself, on which the UK has a long-standing position. In pursuing that reform, we should be guided not just by a concern for representation, but by a recognition of the responsibilities which membership entails. That need not necessarily imply accepting specific military commitments. But it does require strong engagement with security issues across the board, wherever they arise. </p> <p>The third theme which I want to highlight is the importance of building the wider conditions for long-term, sustainable security. Let me take just two quick examples.</p> <p>The first is good governance. Well-governed, capable and accountable states are less likely to act aggressively, descend into conflict, or harbour terrorists and criminals - so we all have an interest in supporting them. The United Nations is well-placed to develop international norms on good governance, provide practical support for their implementation, and set up mechanisms for their review. And it also has unique legitimacy and expertise in spreading practical democracy. In Afghanistan, the UN's success in registering some 10\u00bd million electors has been remarkable. And in Iraq, the UN has a vital role to play in overseeing the political process. Just over a year on, the terrible and tragic attack of 19 August last year in Baghdad is still a painful memory for the UN's staff there, as it is for all of us. We and the United States are working closely with the UN to ensure that it gets the security which it needs to increase its presence on the ground, in order to offer the Iraqi Independent Electoral Commission and the Interim Government the advice and support which they have requested to organise successful elections. It is important that we do everything we can to maintain the time-table for those elections in January. And I welcome the appointment of Ashraf Jehnagir Qazi as Special Representative of the Secretary General, to lead the UN team in Iraq.</p> <p>The second example is this: The UN could do more to make development assistance more effective and better co-ordinated. It can help to push aid donors to greater generosity, and encourage recipients to spend aid more transparently and more effectively. As we have seen in Darfur, more could be done to improve the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system. The UK therefore strongly supports the Good Humanitarian Donorship process, promoting better co-ordination and prioritisation, and the more effective allocation of resources. </p> <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p> <p>Let me conclude with some observations on Britain's own role in shaping the United Nations' future.</p> <p>We have helped to shape the UN from its foundation. In 1946, London hosted the first meetings of the General Assembly, in Methodist Central Hall, and the Security Council, in Church House. Through our role in the Security Council and other UN bodies, our important contribution to the budget and to peacekeeping operations around the globe, and our strong commitment to an effective international system, we can be proud of the part which Britain has played in the UN's development. </p> <p>And we are well-placed to contribute as the UN adapts to today's global security challenges. Our armed forces are second to none, and highly adapted to modern, mobile operations. And we pursue a modern, active and wide-ranging foreign policy which helps to build the conditions for long-term global security and sustainable development. Tony Blair has convened the Commission for Africa, with the aim of putting the concerns of that continent back at the top of the international agenda. We will continue to lobby for the International Finance Facility proposed by Gordon Brown, which offers the potential of doubling development aid by leveraging the power of the capital markets. We will use our Presidency of the Security Council in October to lead work on following up the Secretary-General's report on Justice and the Rule of Law, an initiative which I launched during our last Presidency a year ago. And next year, when Britain holds the Presidency of the EU and the G8, we will have an important role to play in preparing for the Summit reviewing progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, and in following up the work of the High-Level Panel. </p> <p>Britain has as vital an interest as any country in a strong, modern and effective United Nations. We will remain at the forefront of efforts to build a new international consensus on the threats we face, and the tools which we can use, collectively, to address them. The UN's history shows a remarkable capacity to adapt and to realise its potential. We need now to ensure that it continues to do so, to address the security challenges of the next decades.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Northerner, Guardian Unlimited's weekly digest of the best of the northern press. <p><b>HAGUE EARNS GBP1M A YEAR</b></p> <p>Why shouldn't politicians have their fingers in a variety of pies? That's the question pondered by a Yorkshire Post leader writer following the revelation that William Hague, MP for Richmond (the Yorkshire one) tops the list of high-earning MPs with an income of GBP1m a year.</p> <p>The YP line is that Mr Hague's big earnings are fine so long as there is no conflict of interests. Because the system is more transparent, the Post argues, it cracks down on rogue politicians trying to make a quick buck.</p> <p>Despite his negligible contributions to the daily cut and thrust of Westminster life, Mr Hague's stock has soared since resigning as leader of the Tory party in 2001. Our William has in fact become one of the most popular figures on the rubber chicken circuit, an arena where John Major can charge a GBP28,000 a time for a speech and Edwina Currie's diaries sell for GBP300,000.</p> <p>Politicians know that any moment their star could fall and they could end up back on the G-list of political celebritydom. However, for Mr Hague, the fall from grace has proven more lucrative than his days as a working politician.</p> <p>He has netted his million from directorships, speeches, consultancy work, a newspaper column and fees from a forthcoming book. Such an income is ten times as much as he would have been paid as leader of the opposition. As an MP, his salary is a mere GBP57,485.</p> <p>In the last 12 months he has delivered 38 speeches to high profile clients including Mercedes Benz, KPMG and Clifford Chance. He presented the satirical current affairs show Have I Got News For You a year ago and spoke up for one of the nation's favourite books on the BBC's Big Read. It is rumoured that Harper Collins paid GBP200,000 for the UK rights to his forthcoming book on William Pitt the Younger. And his weekly column in the News of the World is said to bring in GBP190,000 a year.</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>Sports scientists at Liverpool John Moores University have found that exercise makes the heart grow stronger. In fact, a fit and active 60 year old man could be in better shape than an inactive 20-year old-slob.</p> <p>In an important victory in the battle for healthy living, researchers demonstrated that long term exercise can delay the ageing of the heart and reduce the risk of heart problems and heart failure itself. </p> <p>A study by David Goldspink, professor of cell and molecular exercise, found that if you have led an active life you could still be fit when you collect your pension.</p> <p>\"The performance of the heart declines steadily as men get older,\" said Professor Goldspink. \"The hearts of our inactive older volunteers showed a 20% fall in their pumping performance compared to the 20-year-olds. But the veteran athletes have the cardiac performance that is the same if not greater than the 20-year-old inactive youths.\" </p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>The world is about to lose one of its most colourful waterways, according to the Manchester Evening News. There will still be the Blue Danube, the Red Sea and the Black Sea, but soon the tomato soup-coloured Bridgewater Canal in Greater Manchester will be no more.</p> <p>Red ochre from iron ore deposits found in abandoned mines at Worsley have turned the canal - one of the first built during the industrial revolution - a striking shade of Heinz orange. The waterway will be returned to a more familiar colour in a GBP1m clean-up project.</p> <p>Work is about to start, but many local residents want the canal to keep its distinctive hue. They say it is unique feature of the village. Salford city council has received 61 letters of objection and a 500-name petition. Paul Ryder, the former Happy Mondays star, claims the distinctive water is part of Worsley's heritage.</p> <p>Despite their protests, the Coal Authority and Salford council have secured financial backing to set up a pumping station and treatment beds at Worsley, which will filter out the ochre before water is returned to the canal.</p> <p>A spokesman for Salford council said: \"At the moment the iron ochre prevents anything from growing in the canal and the pollution clean-up will benefit wildlife and tourism.\"</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>Liverpool's Cavern club, the shrine where the Beatles found stardom, was at the heart of last weekend's Mathew Street festival in the heart of Liverpool. </p> <p>While revellers enjoyed three days of celebrations, including the arrival of the QE2, campaigners want to revive memories of what they claim is the other - and the original - home of scouse rock.</p> <p>They told the Liverpool Daily Post that the Iron Door club, in the basement of a now-demolished warehouse, was rocking and rolling long before the Cavern opened its doors to the Fab Four.</p> <p>The Iron Door has been forgotten by all but its die-hard fans. Now former owner Geoff Hogarth hopes to gain international recognition for his old club by hosting a reunion concert in its honour. Many of the old bands (or versions thereof) will return to play at the concert this Friday (September 3) at the Olympia, Liverpool, including Mike Pender's the Searchers, the Undertakers and Kingsize Taylor and the Dominoes.</p> <p>Now a car park, the Iron Door club at 13 Temple Street was famous for its long jamming sessions and all nighters - 12 bands over 12 hours. According to devotees, it caught on to the rock and roll craze while the Cavern was still a jazz club. </p> <p>Hogarth wants the Iron Door to be included in the 2008 capital of culture celebrations. \"I don't want the event to come and go without it being mentioned. It may not be as famous as the Cavern but it played an important part in the musical history of Liverpool. We were playing rock and roll before the Cavern had even thought about it.\"</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p> A touch of magic has helped the cause of the Friends of Abbeydale Picture House. The Sheffield Star reports that magician Paul Daniels and his lovely assistant and wife Debbie McGee have signed up as patrons of the grade II listed building in Sheffield, which was closed in 1975.</p> <p>It has taken more than a magic wand to keep the picture house from the bulldozers. The 1920s building was an old haunt for many locals, who want to see it back in use. Monty Python star Michael Palin was the first to lend his support to the project. </p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>Bring your own if you go to Oldham. The Evening Chronicle explains that teenage tearaways are plundering toilets in newly-restored Alexandra Park, nicking toilet rolls and sometimes stuffing them down loos.</p> <p>Visitors to the park are wondering why, after the GBP3.2m revamp, there were insufficient funds left to allow them to spend a penny in comfort. The park shop, using its initiative, has been charging 50p a roll for those who require that extra bit of luxury when popping for a quick loo break. </p> <p>Park bosses are planning to tackle the situation immediately by installing vandal proof dispensers. The park's manager, Steve Smith, said: \"It is not the council policy to charge people to use the facilities in Alexandra Park. The council cleans and stocks the toilets with toilet rolls every morning, but youths have been removing the paper and blocking the toilets with it.\"</p> <p>A postcard from the early 1900's showing the Pagoda built as a meteorological observatory, now forming part of the regeneration of Oldham's Alexandra Park, originally created in 1865 as a Victorian job creation scheme, and now restored after a five year 3.2 million programme.</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p><b>DAVID WARD RECOMMENDS...</b></p> <p>Last week it was brass in Buxton.

  "<p>A few years ago I was asked by a Hollywood producer to look over the script of a film of Macbeth. It was to be set in Africa; the idea was to do something like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet with \"the Scottish play\", as it is superstitiously known by actors. Jodie Foster had been pencilled in as a white Lady Macbeth, a corrupting quasi-colonial influence on Macbeth, himself a courageous African army officer who goes to the bad. </p> <p>There were actually two versions of the script, both set in modern times. In one, Macbeth in Africa, Lady Macbeth is a shrewish demon, sympathetic only because she is pregnant. In the other version, Makbet, names are given a Bantu spin. Duncan becomes Dunkani. Dunsinane is Dunsinani. Banquo is restyled as Banko. Lady Macbeth is a moral crusader in this version, who wants power in order to do good, in order to \"save\" Africa. </p> <p>On the page, it was tough stuff in both cases. Malcolm's children are killed by a grenade in Makbet. Lady Macbeth has a miscarriage in a swimming pool in Macbeth in Africa, which begins with Macbeth and Banquo's helicopter crashing in a forest. And so on. </p> <p>Neither of those productions has yet seen the light of day. But Macbeth in Africa? It's not out of the question. When Shakespeare and his fellow investors built the Globe Playhouse in London they chose the motto Totus mundus agit histrionem for their enterprise - \"The whole world plays the actor\" in critic Stephen Greenblatt's rough translation. Usually this has been taken to refer to a uniform human tendency to dissemble. Nowadays one might see the motto in terms of \"global\" Shakespeare: a promiscuous body of work that lends itself to production by different cultures or in the mode of those cultures, always inviting diverse interpretations. A new touring production by Max Stafford-Clark's Out of Joint Company, which sets the play in a contemporary African setting, is very much in this spirit, pressing parallels (civil war, genocide, corruption) between the beleaguered continent and late-medieval Scotland. </p> <p>There have been earlier attempts to set, and play, Macbeth in Africa. Umabatha was a Zulu version by Welcome Msomi. First produced in 1970 in Durban, it came to London two years later. It was set in early 19th-century Zululand in the era of the great chief Shaka. \"What inspired me to choose Macbeth,\" Msomi wrote, \"is that the intrigue, plots and counterplots of the Scottish clans were almost a carbon copy of the drama that took place with the early nations of Africa.\" Umabatha returned to the London stage - to the new Globe, as it happens - in 2001, to equal acclaim. </p> <p>There have also been Francophone productions of Macbeth in Senegal (1965) and Cote D'Ivoire (1993). Wale Ogumyemi produced a Nigerian version of Macbeth in 1968 that switched manically between Yoruba and English, giving it a \"feverish intensity\" in the words of a contemporary critic. </p> <p>\"For African audiences,\" says Cambridge University Shakespearean John Kerrigan, \"in societies undergoing rapid 'modernisation', the pull between the impulses of Macbeth, the magic of the witches etc, and a more instrumental, externally derived way of governing things, presumably seems particularly relevant.\" He adds, though, that \"this postcolonial account of the play might also be guilty of colonial assumptions about how tribal Africa worked\". </p> <p>Kerrigan agrees that the play's supposed universality - \"at least, its transferability to other cultures\" - has much to do with its Lord of the Flies feel of stripping society down to the basics of power-play and competition. However, the real geo-political point is that it was written with the interests of the new British monarch James I in mind: \"The Irish kerns attack from the Western Isles at the start of the play and come back to aid Macbeth in the final battle. The Norweyans (Danes, historically) also encroach from the east of what we take to be Scotland. So it's really 'the archipelagic play' or 'the multi-ethnic play' rather than 'the Scottish play'.\" </p> <p>For all its geographical promiscuity, Macbeth is still very much a product of a specific time and place (London, 1606). Greenblatt (in a new biography of Shakespeare, Will in the World) argues that the play is subtly about the Gunpowder Plot. He points out that the intended victim of the plot, King James I of England - already James VI of Scotland - traced his descent from Banquo. An intellectual, James would have recognised the references when he saw the play, and Shakespeare meant him to. \"Yours is the line of succession,\" the playwright is saying to the watching king. \"Right here, right now, that other witches' prophesy comes true .\" </p> <p>But surely Shakespeare is universal, one wants to say. Surely we can press harder those parallels with postcolonial Africa in the struggle for power which Macbeth dramatises, thereby lifting it away from its specific conditions of production? Yes and no. The point is not just that witchcraft was common in early 17th-century Britain and is common in contemporary Africa. Nor just that the characters in Macbeth are subject to something like \"tribalism\" and the ravages of civil war, as many Africans are today. As Conrad put it in Heart of Darkness, writing of the Thames, Britain also \"has been one of the dark places of the earth\". Africa has no special claim on savagery, in other words. But this does not mean Africa, or some part of Africa, is an arbitrary setting for the play. </p> <p>The deeper reason why an African-themed production of Macbeth might be viable is that there are direct lines of influence from late-medieval Scotland, through James, the double king, via imperial Scots servants of empire and an idea of the Jacobite romance to certain parts of the Africa of today. This connection lay at the heart of my own novel The Last King of Scotland (1998), which dramatised the relationship between a young Scottish doctor and the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. In fact, Macbeth was very much in my mind as I wrote the book. </p> <p>And I wasn't the first to connect Amin to the Scottish play. Dev Virahsawmy produced a notable version of Macbeth, called Zeneral Makbef, in Mauritius in 1982. Written in Creole, it to some extent dramatised Amin's career, punning on the creole words mak (pimp) and bef (bull). </p> <p>The actual Amin was a man fascinated by all things Caledonian. It began when he was commissioned into the King's African Rifles and fell under the spell of a group of Scottish officers. He rose quickly through the ranks and their approval for this resourceful, tough character grew. Like Macbeth, he had many good qualities as well as bad before he came to power. Like Macbeth, he had everything going for him. This is what makes them tragic. And like Macbeth, he was keen on witchcraft. </p> <p>Amin did some military training in Scotland and returned there as Ugandan head of state (to Holyrood Palace) after his coup d'etat in 1971. He began dressing some of his soldiers in kilts and making them march behind the bagpipes. Within just a few years, however, as he fell out of favour with Britain, he became a vocal supporter of Scottish self-determination, at one point even offering to be the country's \"king\"; thus the title of my novel: </p> <p>\"Unless the Scots achieve their independence peacefully,\" he announced, \"they will take up arms and fight the English until they regain their freedom. Many of the Scottish people already consider me King of the Scots. I am the first man to ask the British government to end their oppression of Scotland. If the Scots want me to be their King, I will.\" </p> <p>In addition to this twisted Jacobitism, another part of Scottish heritage formed Amin's character: that mainly Unionist, converting, bridge-building passion which was central to British imperial power. Countless Scottish railway engineers and missionaries spread a net of steel and scripture across Africa in the first half of the 20th century. Amin, strange fish as he was, sprung from that net. </p> <p>Those Scots brought with them something of the same ambition and zeal which warps Macbeth. And this in turn came to these \"men of parts\" directly from the disinheritance that resulted from King James's union of the two kingdoms. Over time, the English cut the Scots out in the domestic power stakes. They had to go abroad to make their mark. And Amin took the cultural shape of his own bizarre rebellion from these canny expatriate Scots. </p> <p>Well, that is an account of one passage through time and space, one line of succession suggesting why a production of Macbeth set in Africa might not be arbitrary in its choice of setting: one can move from one set of specific conditions to another by following the lines of influence. </p> <p>That is not to say Shakespeare cannot be universal at the same time as being specific. For in the end the link between Scotland and Africa which appealed to me when I was writing my novel, and to those involved in this new production, is subject to a common human factor in the play that moves through both history and geography. Call it ambition. Call it desire. Call it will in the world. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Giles Foden's new book, Mimi and Toutou Go Forth, is published later this month. Macbeth opens at the Red Brick Mill, Batley (01484 430528), on September 10, then tours.</p>",
  "<p>What is Apple trying to tempt us with this time? A glamorous new wireless desktop computer as skinny as a catwalk model, as minimal as a John Pawson flat, that's what. For those of you working at home, the iMac G5, launched in a whirl of dry-ice publicity in Paris this week, will allow you to say farewell to dog/cat/toddler-trips-over-cable misery as you hurry to meet deadlines. Or it might be used to impress green-faced office colleagues stuck in front of antique Anglepoise-style iMac computers dating all the way back to 2002. As for those still cranking out their work on the first generation of multi-coloured translucent iMacs of 1998: they are dismissed to the outer realms of the electronic ether. </p> <p>The latest iMac, designed by Apple's relentlessly award-winning Jonathan Ive in his Silicon Valley studio, is not just good-looking, with every accessory you could possibly need packed inside its two-inch-deep, 17 or 20-inch wide screen; it has a memory approximately a million times greater than the very first generation of home computers beginning with the MITS Altair 8800 that went on sale in the US, in kit form, priced $395, in January 1975. </p> <p>That machine looked like a leftover from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the sort of anonymous box of electronics that you find dumped in canals. But, it could be used at home - a giant leap for the computer - and was tiny compared to the cabinet-sized IBM machines that looked like giant tape-recorders. </p> <p>Steve Wozniak's Apple 1 made its tenuous debut at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California in April 1976. It represented a revolution-in-the-making, but, clad in timber, looked like a component from a 1930s telephone exchange, and made a Louis XV chair look positively hi-tech. Teamed up the following year with Steve Jobs on the prototype Apple II, Wozniak approached Jim Warren at the first of his West Coast Computer Fairs. Housed in a beige plastic case, Apple II boasted such highly desirable refinements as a built-in keyboard and coloured graphics. When the two Steves offered a sceptical Warren a share in their new company for space at the fair, he shook his head. That headshake cost Warren a fortune. </p> <p>Apple blossomed. Its 1984 Macintosh became a darling of the design and publishing industry. Beige, upright and boxy, and very, very slow compared to the Apples and PCs we are used to now, it marked the beginning of the clear-cut divide between Apple and the rest. </p> <p>Increasingly aware of the marketing power of chic, as opposed to purely practical design, Apple had Ridley Scott direct its TV and cinema ads that year, and then, bit by megabyte, began to shape a new generation of machines calculated to appeal to graphic designers, product designers, architects and, ultimately, to the design-conscious chattering classes as a whole. </p> <p>The British-born Ive brought real excitement to the design of desktop computers with the 1998 iMac. Brightly coloured and wired up for the internet, it adorned the desks of cooing designers and their groupies. In his book Electric Dreams: Designing for the Digital Age (V&amp;A Publications, 2004), David Redhead notes that even as Business Week magazine greeted the iMac as \"illustrating the company's gradual slide into irrelevance\", Apple sold 150,000 of the colourful computers on the first weekend they went on sale. </p> <p>Computers had finally adopted the sleek and even sensual styling of the best hi-fi systems and cameras. What had looked like inscrutable components from hard-worked laboratories or early Moog synthesisers were now consumer goods, lifestyle accessories, desktop fetishes to preen over and show off. </p> <p>Most PC users see their computers as hugely useful tools: they will tell you how many more functions, or how many zillion more gigabytes of processing power, their latest laptop has compared with an iMac G5. This, though, misses the point. Simplicity of operation aside, Apples relies on sheer style to sell, at a premium, in a hugely competitive market. Even though products such as the iMac and iPod have widened the appeal of Apple and boosted sales to new heights, the company has just 3% of the global PC market, down from 5% five years ago. As Jobs told Time magazine in 2000: \"Victory in our industry is survival.\" </p> <p>Ive and his team are already well advanced on the design of the next generation of Apple computers. How they will look is, inevitably, a closely guarded secret. They could, of course, look like anything. Why not abandon minimalist, silver-sheen chic and produce a desktop that can be packaged and repackaged in any number of styles to suit fans of Gothic, Greek, Bauhaus, or deconstructivist styles? Office managers would have a fit, of course, because theirs, for the most part, is a world of the IBM-style neatness of 40 years ago. </p> <p>This is the very world the miniature computer has helped so many people escape, to set up on their own, to gain control over their own destinies, and perhaps why Apple has made a design fetish out of its desktop and laptop computers. Not only can they look good at home but, plugged into the world, with your choice of music, you feel, if only fleetingly, master or mistress of your universe. </p> <p>Apple's computers are an attempt to create a little piece of perfection in an imperfect world. It can never win, of course, and gradgrind PCs will continue to dominate the market, but as the latest iMac shows, Apple simply can't help but keep trying to lead us into electronic temptation.</p>",
  "<b> Religious studies</b> <br> <p><b> The gospel according to Crumb</b><br> Word has it that Robert Crumb has been signed up by WW Norton to produce a \"nonfiction graphic work ... a 'literal' interpretation of Genesis, the first book of the Bible\". Leaving aside for the moment quibbles about that word \"nonfiction\", Crumb initially seems an odd choice for this project. </p> <p>Best known as the creator of Mr Natural and Fritz the Cat, and as one of the 60s generation of \"underground\" cartoonists who brought sex, drugs, violence and politics back into American comics, Crumb has repeatedly been accused of misogyny and racism and has often had his work banned or impounded by the authorities. Moreover, Terry Zwigoff's 1998 documentary about Crumb and his even weirder brothers revealed him to be a neurotic sexual obsessive from a deeply dysfunctional family. On top of that, he moved to France some years ago - specifically, he claimed, because he feared being murdered in his bed by rightwing Christian vigilantes. </p> <p>That said, Crumb should be able to include many of his trademark depictions of enormous-thighed sexual dominatrices, particularly as these fantasy women of his are usually Jewish, which is a start. Nor is there a general shortage of biblical sex and violence (we'll pass on drugs, unless you include milk, honey or manna), as was proved - if it needed to be - by Knockabout's 1987 comic book, Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament, wherein many leading graphic artists (not including Crumb) portrayed some of the Bible's juicier scenes of rape, human sacrifice, warfare, murder and the wrath of God. </p> <p>To be fair, this last was in fact produced as an ironic response to yet another attack by moralising Christians warning of the enormous damage that comics do to our kids. (Ironically, as a child I was given a comic book of the Second Book of Kings, produced by eager evangelists connecting - so they thought - to the zeitgeist of 60s youth culture.) </p> <p>And anyway, the whole of western art has been informed by biblical imagery for the past 1,500 years, so why shouldn't Crumb et al join in? The art critic Robert Hughes has described Crumb as the Hieronymous Bosch de nos jours: Bosch, of course, is famous for his grisly biblical scenes, and at a pinch you could describe the three panels of his triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights as a primitive comic strip. Maybe nothing could be more natural than God as Mr Natural.<br><b>Martin Rowson</b> </p> <p><b>Outdoor pursuits</b><br> </p> <p><b> Any way the wind blows</b><br> Did you know the winds in Athens are \"shifty\"? You may not, but others do. Fiona Campbell is an expert in winds. She is the marine meteorologist employed by the Royal Yachting Association to measure the weather for the British Olympic Sailing Team. She peers into the eye of the calm. </p> <p>As soon as the Olympic flags were furled in Sydney four years ago, Campbell began her diagnosis of Greek weather for the 2004 games. She connected an Athenian anemo-meter (a device that notes wind speed and direction) to a computer in her office on the Isle of Wight. It sent her billets doux from the Saronic gulf each day. She constructed computer models, like the ones that predicted global destruction in the film The Day After Tomorrow, and stared at them. </p> <p>She travelled to Athens with the Olympic team in the summers of 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and bobbed on the water clutching a hand-held measuring device and a compass, learning how the wind behaved. \"I measured the weather every day between May and September,\" she says. \"We had to know if a light wind or a strong wind would blow; we had to know what to expect. I needed local knowledge, which I could relate to the sailors so they could see the signs of wind change. In the UK, sea breezes shift to the right. In Athens, because of the local topography, they shift to the left. If the sailors hadn't known this, they would have lost.\" </p> <p>Predictably, the climate information the locals proffered was treacherous. \"They said the Meltemi wind always blew above the Saronic gulf,\" says Campbell. The Meltemi is a biting party animal of a wind that thrusts boats on. But it didn't blow during this Olympic regatta. Instead, the gentle wallflower, the \"sea breeze\", a Valium junkie of a wind, stepped falteringly on to the swell. </p> <p>Drawing on these climate predictions, the British sailing team bagged five medals: two gold, one silver and two bronze. All the major teams employ meteorologists; a sailing team without one is like a sprinter without a Lycra top. Campbell is already charting the seas around Beijing - another \"light\" wind venue - for 2008. She will go out there next summer to caress her anemometer. She anticipates smog and humidity, and her fondest wish is that Britain will host the 2012 Olympic Games. \"We could go down to Weymouth,\" she says wistfully. \"I just want wind.

The question is how long you will live after you have acquired it. Weighing in at 1,000 calories for a double portion with chips, the stonner is a deep-fried sausage wrapped in donner meat and garnished with a secret, spicy sauce. It made its appearance a month ago, in Glasgow, and has been roundly denounced by health experts ever since. </p> <p>So, in the spirit of selfless enquiry, I nobble a companion and seek out Ruby's Fish Bar in Old Dumbarton Road. Undeterred by the warning notice - \"We can only supply one Stonner per customer per week\" - we place our order. </p> <p>Despite the adverse publicity - or because of it - business is booming, says former taxi driver Campbell McArthur: \"I'd be worried if somebody walked out of here, took a bite and dropped dead.

Sarah decides the batter is excessive and peels it off like a banana skin. The stripped stonner looks exposed and vulnerable. </p> <p>As we munch contentedly in the sunshine, a group of girls from the local school pass by, tucking into Ruby's deep-fried delights.

  "The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, attacked the character and credibility of Democratic challenger John Kerry last night, describing him as a politician who has repeatedly \"made the wrong call on national security\". <p>In his address to the Republican convention, Mr Cheney praised Mr Kerry's Vietnam war record - an issue of some controversy since he has been accused of lying by rightwing veterans - but accused him of getting it wrong on national security in the three subsequent decades. </p> <p>He said the senator had opposed Ronald Reagan's defence initiatives, which he claimed had brought victory in the cold war, opposed Operation Desert Storm when Saddam Hussein stood poised to dominate the Persian Gulf and even opposed an adequate response to the September 11 attacks on America. </p> <p>The vice-president went on to ridicule Mr Kerry's plans to lead a \"more sensitive war on terror\" and his promise to defend America if it is attacked. </p> <p>\"My fellow Americans, we have already been attacked and faced with an enemy who seeks the deadliest of weapons to use against us. We cannot wait for the next attack.</p> <p>\"Senator Kerry denounces American action when other countries don't approve, as if the whole object of our foreign policy were to please a few persistent critics. </p> <p>\"In fact, in the global war on terror, as in Afghanistan and Iraq, President Bush has brought many allies to our side. But as the president has made very clear, there is a difference between leading a coalition of many and submitting to the objections of a few.\"</p> <p>With his executive past running the military supply group Halliburton, Dick Cheney has come to symbolise all that is rotten in the current White House as far as the Democratic tendency is concerned. </p> <p>A few months ago the Washington rumour mill was talking about his likely last-minute replacement by a \"balancing\" moderate - Colin Powell or Rudy Giuliani, perhaps - in order to shore up a faltering Bush campaign. </p> <p>Cheney's frail heart (he has had numerous bypasses) provides a convenient excuse for bowing out and is the reason he has made it clear he will not seek the presidency himself. </p> <p>Last night, however, he formally accepted the vice-presidential nomination, all question marks over his credibility for another term dispelled. </p> <p>Full of confidence in his central role for the remainder of the campaign, he even managed a joke at his own expense.</p> <p>\"People tell me that Senator Edwards [John Kerry's running mate] got picked for his good looks, his sex appeal and his great hair. I say to them: 'How do you think I got the job?'\"</p> <p>Few people find anything warm, charismatic or charming about Mr Cheney. Even the appearance of several generations of his immediate family on stage just after the speech failed to make him appear softer - but this is why the conservative heart of the party loves him. </p> <p>Even in that staged photo opportunity there was a hint of cold calculation: Mary Cheney, his openly lesbian daughter and campaign manager, was missing from the tableau so as not to upset the anti-gay base or divert from the night's message. </p> <p>By the time Mr Cheney took the stage, compassion fatigue had already set in, with an old-school Democrat demolishing the character and credibility of the Democrat challenger. </p> <p>When the Georgia senator Zell Miller gave the keynote address on behalf of his fellow southerner Bill Clinton in Madison Square Garden 12 years ago he had harsh words to say about the president's father, but last night the 72-year-old lambasted his own leadership and declared John Kerry unfit to even be running for the presidency. </p> <p>\"What has happened to the party I've spent my life working in? I can remember when Democrats believed that it was the duty of America to fight for freedom over tyranny,\" he said. </p> <p>\"George Bush wants to grab terrorists by the throat and not let them go, to get a better grip; from John Kerry they get a 'yes, no, maybe' bowl of mush that can only encourage our enemies, and confuse our friends.\"</p> <p>The former marine, who says he will never leave the Democratic party despite his disgust, delivered a tirade that would have sounded more like a crazed rant had it come from the lips of a veteran Republican. </p> <p>The conservative base of the party inside the hall lapped it up, especially when he tore into the Massachusetts senator's record of voting against military spending. </p> <p>\"This is the man who wants to be the commander in chief of our US armed forces. US forces armed with what - spit balls? </p> <p>Zell Miller has long been outside the Democratic fold, and the personal bitterness evident in his speech will not have surprised seasoned party strategists. </p> <p>In the fluid world of American party politics it is impossible to say what extra weight his fratricidal attack may have carried for voters watching at home. </p> <p>It was certainly the most aggressive and damning assault yet on John Kerry's values by any mainstream politician. </p> <p>\"Twenty years of votes can tell you much more about a man than 20 weeks of campaign rhetoric,\" he said. \"Senator Kerry has made it clear that he would use military force only if approved by the United Nations. Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending. I want Bush to decide.\" </p> <p>In praising the president towards the end of his briskly delivered attack, he slipped heavily into hyperbole that delighted the audience. </p> <p>\"I have knocked on the doors of this man's soul and found someone home: a God-fearing man with a good heart and a spine of tempered steel.\" </p> <p>The address prompted Mr Cheney, master of the understatement, to ad-lib a line at the very top of his prepared speech: \"I'm sure glad Zell Miller is on our side.\"</p>",

  "<p>BT yesterday suffered a double blow from watchdogs over complaints that it had infringed competition rules and run misleading ads. </p> <p>Industry regulator Ofcom said that it was proposing to rule that BT had fallen foul of competition rules over its pricing of residential high-speed internet services more than two years ago. </p> <p>In a separate ruling, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled against BT over ads claiming 750,000 customers had returned to the company since February last year and another implying other companies charged for customer helplines. </p> <p>BT said it had already received two favourable rulings - from previous industry watchdog Oftel and the competition appeals tribunal - on the question of whether it had used anti-competitive pricing for broadband services. </p> <p>\"We will make oral and written returns and we are confident we will win a third time.\" </p> <p>Ofcom said that it had inherited the case from its predecessor and could make no further comment. </p> <p>In a research note, Paul Howard, co-head of European telecoms research at brokers Cazenove, said that in theory BT could be fined up to 10% of turnover if it lost on the competition issue. He added: \"Whilst [Ofcom's] announcement might counter early signs of an improving regulatory environment, we suspect Ofcom is to a certain extent just going through the motions in this particular investigation.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sign in reception has changed to \"Cabinet Office E-government Unit\": the Office of the e-Envoy has been abolished. And as offices change, so does the personnel. Outgoing e-envoy Andrew Pinder has spent four years in the job. Now, he is ready to talk about it. </p> <p>After 18 years at the Inland Revenue and time in the private sector, Pinder became e-envoy in 2000. Part of his job was to convince civil servants of the importance of the government's target of placing all services online by the end of next year. In 2001, he compared the civil service to a supertanker, taking a long time to turn round. Three years on, has it changed direction? \"It's never completed, is it?\" he says. \"You've got tides pushing against you all the time.\" </p> <p>He recalls meeting a group of permanent secretaries in 2002. \"The level of scepticism then, and of people showing willingness but not really understanding the topic, was really quite high. Now, it's not. I think the civil service has got it on the use of information technology, and using it for transactional services.\" </p> <p>Pinder says around 95% of the 600 services tracked will be fully online by the deadline. A handful will not, either because large-scale implementations such as e-voting require legislative changes, or because they are used by only a few people, such as for burial at sea. </p> <p>A few years ago, some online services, such as the Inland Revenue's online tax return system, seemed doomed to low usage. So in 2002, increased use of key services was added to the e-envoy's targets. </p> <p>Pinder now says that his old employer is an e-government success story, with usage doubling each year, to the point where around one in seven tax returns are completed on the internet. But surely it compares badly with countries such as Australia, where a third of individual tax returns are filed online? \"The pretty unusual thing - it's not quite unique - about the Inland Revenue is that, on the whole, we do people's tax returns for them through Pay As You Earn. The minority who fill in returns have the most complex finances, and are generally older. Therefore, it's a miracle that any of them are filed electronically.\" </p> <p>Pinder was also charged with making the UK the best environment for e-commerce. In April, the Economist Intelligence Unit and IBM placed the UK second in the world for e-readiness. \"Five years ago, we were way down in the middle,\" he says. </p> <p>Perhaps Pinder's biggest change involved closing the UKOnline portal site, which aimed to help users find the right state sector website, and replacing it with Directgov, which is intended to provide what users want at the one site. </p> <p>Pinder says Directgov uses the concept of franchised sections. So, for example, the Department of Work and Pensions runs the disabled people section of the site, coordinating with other organisations, such as the Department for Transport on dis abled driving licences. Then the DWP produces its section under strict editorial guidelines. Of 32 franchises planned, three are running in full and seven are working on a small scale. \"We're a tenth of the way there,\" says Pinder. \"When you ask, 'Is Directgov doing what I want it to do?' of course it's not. But it will do.\" </p> <p>With hindsight, is there anything he would have done differently? \"I would have worked earlier on trying to get government departments to work together more. We didn't really get on to that until a year or so into my job. It turned out that the key was getting government departments to look after something across government.\" </p> <p>Does he have a favourite gov.uk site? \"The one I should be looking at at the moment is Worktrain,\" jokes Pinder, referring to the jobs and training courses site, adding that the Foreign Office and the Department of Transport are doing well online. </p> <p>What about blogging? \"I have one myself,\" says Pinder, but it isn't public. He has used the technique for internal communications: \"Rather than doing the usual letter from management, I sit down occasionally and tap out a few thoughts. People can have a look and give us feedback on them. It's great as an internal tool.\" </p> <p>Pinder is planning some consultancy work and taking on a few company directorships. But what advice will he offer his successor, Ian Watmore, whose job title will be head of e-government? \"He'd be well advised not to listen to [my advice]. You've got to make your own mark and do your own thing.\" </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\">online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "Russia last night called an emergency session of the UN security council as it sought to drum up international support for its battle against the sudden upsurge in terrorist acts committed by suspected Chechen militants in the past eight days. <p>Andrei Denisov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, requested the evening meeting to secure formal international condemnation of the kidnapping of scores of children in a school in southern Russia. </p> <p>The White House was swift to offer Vladimir Putin support. \"We stand with the Russian people,\" a spokeswoman for George Bush said last night after the US president put in a personal call to his Russian counterpart. </p> <p>\"Both leaders stressed their strong commitment to working together to defeat global terrorism,\" the spokeswoman said, in a message the Kremlin interpreted as an offer of American help in its own war on terror. </p> <p>Yesterday's attack on the school in Beslan, North Ossetia, followed a suicide bombing outside a Moscow metro station the previous day and last week's double bombing of two passenger aircraft. More than 100 people have been killed. </p> <p>Analysts said the UN move was aimed at shoring up international support for any military action Russia might take against militant attacks. </p> <p>Russia is unlikely to approach the UN for logistical support in any military action, given its proud assertion that the Russian military can deal with the Chechen problem. Yet a UN security council resolution backing Russia's right to take military action to secure its population from the terrorist threat would silence critics of its continuing military actions in Chechnya. </p> <p>It could place any future military activity on a par with Washington's decision to invade Afghanistan after September 11, with which last week's double plane crash has been compared. </p> <p>The Kremlin had remained silent for hours after news of the attack on the Beslan school, struggling to square its fiery rhetoric about vanquishing terrorists with the potential public outrage at a bloody outcome to its second major hostage crisis at the hands of militants in two years. </p> <p>Just before news broke of the Beslan crisis, President Putin reiterated that Russia would have no truck with terrorists. Reacting to the suicide bombing in Moscow, he said he was prepared to talk to anyone in Chechnya, bar separatists and terrorists. </p> <p>\"There can be no dialogue with those who wanted to fight and who made war a way of earning money,\" he said. \"We shall fight against them, throw them in prisons and destroy them.\" </p> <p>President Putin's top two law enforcement ministers, security service head Nikolai Patrushev and interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, were sent to the Beslan school to take command of the rescue operation. </p> <p>The Kremlin faced considerable public criticism for its handling of the boldest terrorist act to hit the Putin presidency: the October 2002 Dubrovka theatre siege in which more than 800 theatregoers were taken hostage by 40 gunmen. </p> <p>The siege was ended when special forces released a gas into the building, killing 129 hostages and the gunmen. The victims' relatives remain incensed at how opaque the events of the siege remain and the poor medical care given to their relatives immediately after the event. </p> <p>Mr Putin's opinion poll rating slumped recently to its lowest since he sought re-election in March. His image as a man of stability and order lifts him above his competitors, yet he cannot afford another show of Russian force to end in hundreds more dead hostages.</p>",
  "<p>Jewellery sales lost their sparkle last month as higher interest rates made consumers more cautious, the transatlantic jewellery group Signet said yesterday. </p> <p>The company - whose 1,725 outlets include Ernest Jones and H Samuel in Britain plus Kays and the more upmarket Jared in the US - was announcing first-half profits up 14% at \u00a354m, despite the weaker dollar. At constant exchange rates, profits were ahead 27%. </p> <p>Signet generates more than two-thirds of group sales in the US and several leading retailers there recently warned of slowing trade. Terry Burman, chief executive, played down last month's decline and described the group's results as \"excellent\". </p> <p>He said August sales were always slow and did not mean the second half - when the jewellery business generates the bulk of its sales - would be the same. He pointed to one-offs such as the Florida hurricane and last year's US tax rebates as partly to blame for this year's poorer figures. </p> <p>\"While there has been some softening of the trading environment in August on both sides of the Atlantic, this is not necessarily indicative of trading prospects for the balance of the year.\" </p> <p>In Britain, where Signet has 599 outlets, like-for-like sales were ahead 5.5% in the first half. Group like-for-like figures were up 7.4%. </p> <p>Sales had been boosted on both sides of the Atlantic by customers splashing out for Valentine's day. </p> <p>Mr Burman pointed to diamonds and luxury watches as top sellers. </p> <p>He also revealed plans to increase capital expenditure by 57% to \u00a380m this year. The cash will be spent on revamping or relocating 85 UK stores, compared with 32 last year. In the US there are plans to increase selling space by 8%. </p> <p>The shares were the second biggest faller in the FTSE 250, closing down 2.25p at 102.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Westminster City Council spends a staggering \u00a332m a year on keeping its streets clean, more than any other UK local council. But it gets its money's worth thanks to global positioning systems and mobile technology. </p> <p>When it awarded a new waste management contract to Onyx last September, the council insisted the company buy new trucks and equip them with satellite global positioning systems (GPS) and general packet radio services (GPRS) modems for mobile data. </p> <p>Today, GPS cards plugged into small wireless computers in 90 Onyx trucks and 10 cage vehicles work out the location of each vehicle every 45 seconds, using a signal from the nearest satellite. This data is sent wirelessly over O2's mobile network into a database at Westminster. </p> <p>\"Using this information, Westminster City Council can see where every van is and compare that with the times it is scheduled to collect rubbish - or bottles, plastics or paper for recycling,\" says Westminster's network director, Andrew Snellgrove. </p> <p>There are two main reasons why Westminster wants this information. First, it wants to ensure that Onyx is meeting the terms of its contract. </p> <p>Second, it wants data to make improvements. It plans, for example, to work out a typical quantity of recyclable waste per street, to encourage underperforming streets to recycle more, particularly as EU regulations on the proportion of waste that must be recycled get tougher. </p> <p>\"Year on year, the cost of waste disposal is increasing,\" says Dave Pettitt, project manager for the mobile data project. \"There are big European targets we have to start meeting. And landfill sites are going to become harder to find, so we need to recycle as much as possible.\" </p> <p>Each refuse and recycling truck has load scales on it, accurate to 50 kilos. Every time a bag is added, the van's weight goes up. In the next six weeks, this data will also be transmitted wirelessly to Westminster via GPRS. </p> <p>\"We don't just want to know that a van is in the right street,\" says Pettitt. \"We also want to know it is actually collecting rubbish. </p> <p>\"We will be using a rules-based system that works out how many stops a van will make on a typical street, so we can see if the van is making all the collections it should be.\" </p> <p>Other data can be added to the computers. For example, Onyx added the dates and times of last weekend's Notting Hill Carnival, and which streets would be closed to refuse vans. Drivers can also add information on obstacles, so Westminster's call centre knows what to tell callers. </p> <p>More efficient refuse collection means that on-street environmental managers do not have to spend as much time reporting on missed collections and instead can focus on other aspects of their work. </p> <p>They previously used a forerunner of the current mobile system, carrying personal digital assistants connected to the O2 network. Some employees liked the system, but others felt it dictated the way they worked. The system is no longer in use. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Pettit says: \"It is definitely part of our plan to provide mobile access on smartphones to the system for our street staff.\" </p> <p>Back in the office, the van location data is displayed using a property and land database called UNI-form from ESRI (UK), a company whose modules are used in about 200 local councils in the UK, though not in the same way Westminster is using them. The GPS map coordinates are translated into the position of a van on a Westminster street. </p> <p>The waste management monitoring system seems to be working well. Rubbish collection is frequent, and overflowing bins are scarce in the Westminster Council area, where I live. Up to three large items a year, such as broken washing machines, are collected free by the council within seven days of the request. </p> <p>And if I leave blue recycling bags containing glass, plastic or card outside my front door on a Tuesday morning, they are gone by the time I get home. </p> <p>Nor is the system expensive. Although Onyx bought its vans, Westminster and Onyx share technology costs. Snellgrove says that the GPRS data networking costs just \u00a38 a month per van to transmit the location data to the database. </p> <p>The cost is low partly because Westminster has a fixed telecoms link to O2. This means that although location data travels wirelessly, its onward journey to Westminster's offices is over the cheaper fixed link. </p> <p>Snellgrove hopes to lower costs for using mobile data applications in Westminster even further, by using combined GPRS and Wi-Fi cards in mobile devices. This would mean that wherever the council has installed Wi-Fi wireless networks, data transmission will be free. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\">online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>British rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters, hailed by successive governments and water companies as some of the cleanest in Europe, are in such poor ecological shape that many may fail new water quality laws. </p> <p>Preliminary assessments by the Environment Agency yesterday suggest that although the overall chemical quality of water has improved in the past decade, hundreds of rivers and lakes are still being seriously polluted by sewage, fertilisers, and sheep dip pesticides. Many more areas are adversely affected by land drainage, over-abstraction of water, flood embankments and urban pollution. </p> <p>The maps introduced yesterday show that 20% of all English and Welsh rivers are in danger of failing laws to comply with the new EU water framework directive, because of pesticides. One in 10 rivers has too much water taken from it for drinking or farming. </p> <p>The agency estimates that 40% of all rivers are threatened at some point along their lengths, that 10,750 miles of river are being polluted by towns, and that almost all rivers in north-east England show significant pollution from old mine workings. </p> <p>It said that it could cost \u00a36bn-\u00a312bn over 20 years to reach the standards required by 2015. But the money should be more than repaid by the savings made in health, pollution, and even flooding costs. </p> <p>\"The current standards were set in 1976,\" said Martin Griffiths, head of the water framework directive at the agency. </p> <p>\"The new directive sets high ecological standards and will give added protection for drinking water. </p> <p>\"It costs a lot more to clean up water than it does to protect it. The new standards will benefit fishermen, recreation users and wildlife.\" </p> <p>Sarah Oppenheimer, policy adviser to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \"The new directive takes the view that water cannot be healthy if you have to treat it with masses of chemicals before you drink it, if it's not safe to swim in, or if fish, plants and insects cannot live in it. </p> <p>\"At the moment the public is losing out three times. It subsidises the farming sector while it continues to pollute water, it pays for pollution through the loss of wetland, wildlife, fisheries and bathing waters, and it pays again to install expensive treatment plants to remove the pollution to make the water fit to drink.\" </p> <p>The directive, widely seen as the most significant piece of European water legislation for 20 years, requires man-made pressures on the water environment, such as sewage discharge and water abstraction, to be managed differently. </p> <p>\"Using chemicals to treat other chemicals - what we do at the moment - is not a long-term answer,\" Ms Oppenheimer said.</p>",
  "<p>Not all contracts with foreign nuclear customers contain return-to-sender clauses (Ministers break promises over nuclear waste, August 31). Those signed pre-1976 do not include such an obligation on BNFL's customers. Tony Benn, then the energy minister, made a public commitment in 1975 to ensure new reprocessing contracts for Sellafield would have to include a repatriation obligation, following revelations in the media, led by the Observer (\"Sweden to dump atom waste on Britain\"). </p> <p>Benn made a statement to parliament via a reply to a written question on January 29 1976. How the repatriation pledge might be put into practice was set out more than 10 years later, in a further written reply on May 2 1986. Now, a further 18 years on, ministers are prepared to dump the pledge to enable them to earn money to dump the waste. </p> <p>I objected, in a submission to the DTI in May, arguing all the waste should be returned to customer countries, including an amount of radioactively contaminated decommissioning waste (contaminated steel and concrete etc), based on the proportion of usage of the reprocessing plant required to carry out the foreign customers' reprocessing requirements. </p> <p>Dounreay in Scotland also holds radioactive waste from foreign customers, along with Sellafield, as reprocessing of difficult-to-handle research spent fuel has been undertaken for several foreign customers at this plant.<br> <strong>Dr David Lowry</strong><br> Co-author, The International Politics of Nuclear Waste </p> <p> These \"secret\" proposals come from a DTI consultation document published last January. There has been no breach in government policy, nor any deception. The policy for returning nuclear waste was set out in a 1995 white paper and has been applied consistently since then. </p> <p>The white paper made clear that all high-level waste will be returned to BNFL's overseas customers as soon as practicable. Shipments will begin in 2007-08. The public consultation document on intermediate waste was published in January. The results are now under consideration. </p> <p>The retention of low-level waste was provided for in the 1995 white paper. In our consultation document, we said 10,000 cubic metres of low-level waste was stored at Drigg in Cumbria. Additional amounts of high-level waste will be returned to the country of origin in place of low-level waste retained in the UK. Nothing has been hidden.

  "<p>My dear prime minister, thank you for inviting me to take over as head of e-government following the unexpected election of the previous appointee, Ian Watmore, as president of Iraq. Perhaps it was a mistake to test e-voting technology in such a volatile environment as Baghdad. None the less, Ian will relish the challenge of sorting out the Middle East. </p> <p>As my computer does not have PowerPoint, I was unable to read Ian's briefing material. In any case, I thought some a priori propositions might be welcome. Here are some early thoughts. </p> <p>First, we should halve the number of websites run by central government. My office will take a lead by amalgamating two web portals, Directgov and Government Gateway, together with the Cabinet Office's own site, at the single address <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk\">www.direct.gov.uk</a>. </p> <p>This would prepare the way for a campaign to drive up usage. The current strategy, relying on the site's indeterminate nationality to attract hits from every English-speaking country, is having limited success. We should immediately activate phase two and display a small EU flag on the home page. The resulting furore should increase the number of unique visitors. </p> <p>Across government, we should implement Sir Peter Gershon's efficiency review suggestions for increasing the take-up of online transactions. Car tax renewals and company VAT returns are an obvious place to start. Both services need to stop pussy-footing around with pilots and soft launches, even if back-office systems still leave much to be desired. </p> <p>Companies could be encouraged to file their VAT returns electronically with a small discount. I suggest 5%. Car owners likewise. Electorally, these measures would do you no harm in two crucial constituencies. </p> <p>Important as the efficiency drive is, it should not be allowed to dominate the e-government programme. Apart from anything else, there is still little evidence for a connection between the two. Rather, I suggest that e-government be considered as an enabler in two other policy themes: new localism and freedom of information. </p> <p>Local authorities should have the option of offering residents access to central e-services. This is a reversal of the current policy of assuming that citizens will sign on for local government through a Whitehall-run portal. Councils working this way would, of course, receive a share of the money they save central government. </p> <p>As for freedom of information, it should be policy that every document produced by government should be posted on the deep web, unless there is a good reason not to. Documents withheld should be publicly identified with a reference number and the reason for secrecy. </p> <p>First, however, we need to shed a millstone. The target of e-enabling every single service by the end of 2005 has served its purpose. We should abandon it as superseded, replacing it with \"priority outcomes\", along the lines of those handed down to local authorities. A grown-up government should not be afraid to admit changing its mind in the light of developments. We are a grown-up government, aren't we? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\">online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Navigating local council departments can often be a nightmare. If you are applying for planning permission to build a loft extension, or if you're a business concerned that you might be in breach of health and safety regulations, you often face a bureaucratic obstacle course. Even when you find the right department, decisions are rarely as fast as you would like. </p> <p>To try to improve this situation, the government has launched a national e-government project called Parsol - planning and regulatory services online. Run by a consortium of local authorities led by Wandsworth Borough Council, the project is developing a range of guidelines and software products to help local authorities build such systems effectively online. </p> <p>Parsol aims to do all the groundwork for local authorities, and offers products free of charge so they can provide faster services based on real-time online transactions. The national project board is confident online systems that allow the tracking of applications will also improve the openness of these procedures, therefore building public confidence in them. </p> <p>\"We have tried to identify where there are gaps in services to citizens and tried to build products that will plug those gaps,\" explains Parsol's programme manager, Stuart Melvin. \"For example, at the moment there is really only general advice available on whether you need planning permission for a household extension. Our new systems will allow users to use the internet to ask that specific question, and they will get an answer they can print off.\" </p> <p>For the enforcement of planning regulations, Parsol has developed systems that will enable citizens to report infringements and track the responses to their complaints. </p> <p>In a bid to make life easier for businesses, Parsol has developed a web-based application that companies can use to assess if they have a complaint about regulations, such as those covering food and health safety. A number of these products are being piloted by local authorities, who are set to demonstrate them to others in their regions to promote wider take-up. Rochdale Metropolitan Borough council, for example, is piloting Parsol's new online licensing software for the submission and processing of a range of licensing applications. </p> <p>\"Parsol has done all the leg work for us. It's a self-contained product that lets you link to your own third-party software,\" says Ken Usman-Smith, principal technology manager for Rochdale's planning and regulatory services. \"We can use it as a platform to build our services on and make sure it's broadly compatible with other authorities.\" </p> <p>While Parsol is offering the software free, there is an implementation cost because councils have to ensure it is integrated with existing systems. According to the project team, 13 councils have implemented one or more of Parsol's products. Take-up is crucial to the success of the project. In October, a series of workshops are being held to promote the products. </p> <p>Parsol is developing a central electronic exchange with seven local authorities and the Environment Agency. It is being used for planning applications in order that documents and data can instantly be made available online to external agencies that need to be consulted. \"For the exchange to work, we need to build up the membership of the service. That is not going to happen overnight,\" says Melvin. </p> <p>One of the project's key ambitions is to establish a more joined-up approach to initiating and tracking regulation and licensing applications. Andy Waren, the chair of the project, hopes to help standardise the approaches of local authorities to make dealings with local and central government easier. \"We hope Parsol can offer an improvement on the existing systems,\" says Waren. \"I think it is going to be a question of take-up by local authorities.\" </p> <p>The Parsol project runs until March and has received more than \u00a34.5m to achieve its objectives. The majority of national e-government projects have toolkits, but Parsol's software development work is a lot more advanced than many. More councils need to adopt the software and their staff need to appreciate the benefits of this new way of working. Furthermore, these new systems have to be communicated effectively to the public. </p> <p>Clearly, some of the pilot councils are grateful for the support they are receiving. However, there is a long way to go before these processes are widely available online. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parsol.gov.uk\">www.parsol.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>For some mysterious reason, I was not one of those asked this week by the right-wing thinktank Civitas to become a shareholder in its new model school in north-west London, an educational initiative necessary, in part, to stem the rot of a culture \"in serious decline - one might say meltdown\". </p> <p>However, as a long-time resident of the area in which the new model school will open its doors later this month, I did get its arresting yellow leaflet announcing its intention to set up a school promoting \"the values and knowledge on which the survival of the culture depends\" and calling for local support. </p> <p>Parents felt alternately intrigued and irritated. More than 100 people attended a fractious meeting in February, at which some dared to suggest that Civitas was playing on middle-class fears of the racial mix in local schools, the so-called \"playground effect\". In recent years, this patch has become packed with middle-class families, many of them staggering under the burden of high mortgages. But this is also Brent, one of the most multicultural boroughs in the country; inevitably, the schools reflect that. Civitas surely knew exactly what demographics, and what buried sensitivities, it was targeting with its offer of a \u00a33,000-a-year education based on \"Judaeo Christian\" values. A private education with moral knobs on. </p> <p>Despite that packed February meeting, the new model school has so far failed to recruit many entrants. According to news reports, only 10 parents have signed up. Hence, the need for this week's appeal to potential shareholders, and the warnings of imminent global moral collapse. </p> <p>One can only speculate why so few parents have taken up the Civitas offer; low-cost, \"no frills\" private schooling. But one answer may be a somewhat surprising level of parental support for local schools in Brent. </p> <p>Despite a significant drain to the private sector in this area and a never-ending debate about the problems of the state sector, there exists among local parents a sense that something really important hangs on the success of our local schools: social cohesion in the inner city, no less. One can sense in their attitude towards the local school something between a belief and a yearning for a sense of community, as well as a wish to come to terms with, rather than shy away from, the complexities of the modern world. </p> <p>Our daughters' school, a large mixed primary, is minutes away from the sports complex where the new model school will open its doors on September 13. More than 70 languages are spoken; new refugees arrive almost weekly. The 600 or so pupils come from every imaginable social, ethnic and religious background. </p> <p>In a funny way, our large red-brick primary is a kind of faith school, proud of its secular take on its own social and ethnic mix. Such a sense of excitement and celebration is perhaps easier to sustain at primary level, where the brute power and tricky problems of adolescence have not yet intervened. But where it works, a genuinely mixed, local school daily embodies the wish for, the struggle towards, fairness, tolerance and the chance of higher standards for all, not just those endowed with \"social and cultural capital\". </p> <p>Much of this depends on capital of the more basic sort: resources, plus a managing intelligence. At our local primary there is an on-site refugee centre, a strong behaviour policy, and a burgeoning sports and arts programme. There is also an active parental culture. </p> <p>Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world. But it is in the grind and pleasure of such everyday cooperation that the abstract value of community finds specific and positive meaning. And surely not just in Brent: such an experience is being repeated, largely unreported, in inner cities around modern Britain. I'm not sure what Civitas means by \"Judaeo Christian values\" but my re-readings of the Old and New Testaments find as much justification for the world view our school promotes as Civitas no doubt finds for the errors of mass migration or the moral failings of the divorced. </p> <p>Children at our local primary also get the chance to develop what Civitas calls \"social skills and good character\", only as well as traditional good manners they get a grasp of complex religious difference and the vast inequalities in the world we live in. What our school cannot offer is maths to an \"adequate standard for the Common Entrance exams\", French for the very young, and a reading age of eight by the age of five. </p> <p>I remain curious as to why so many undoubtedly anxious local parents have, so far, failed to take up Civitas's offer and why so many seem to have opted instead for the more complex and uncertain adventure of the local school, the noisy truth of community. </p> <p>Perhaps the playground effect works both ways; it is its thrill, rather than its threat, that has swung it for them. Like me perhaps, they prefer the prospect of lively collaboration, the chance of a range of unexpected friends and experiences, over the rigid certainties of 10 bent heads in a rented sports hall. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Melissa Benn is co-editor of a book of essays on education and democracy to be published by Continuum press this month </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mbenn@dircon.co.uk\">mbenn@dircon.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>If the arrest of Kieren Fallon yesterday by police officers investigating allegations of race-fixing came as a complete surprise to the racing world, the reaction of the major bookmakers' trade body a few hours later was rather less of a shock. According to the Association of British Bookmakers, most of racing's problems can be traced back to betting exchanges, and this latest burst of bad publicity was no exception. </p> <p>\"Without wishing to anticipate charges those arrested may [or may not] face,\" its press release said, \"the ABB has consistently warned the government and the Jockey Club that the ability of betting exchange customers to act as unlicensed bookmakers without revealing their identities to punters is the equivalent of the sport sitting on a smouldering powder keg.\" </p> <p>Warming to its theme, the statement added that \"for the betting exchanges to say that cases of alleged corruption would not be identified but for the excellence of their audit trails, is akin to a householder leaving doors and windows wide open and then claiming credit for reporting a burglary.\" </p> <p>Which would be an interesting analogy, were it not such utter nonsense. A more accurate comparison, as it happens, would be with a thoroughly sensible householder who installs the latest in hi-tech security systems. Even if a truly determined burglar manages to burrow his way in through the floorboards, he will at least have CCTV footage to pass on to the police. </p> <p>It is only natural to be afraid of something new and different that seems to threaten the established order of things, not least in a conservative business like racing. </p> <p>As such, Betfair, which dominates the betting exchange market, is an obvious scapegoat for what may turn out to be the most significant betting scandal in living memory. </p> <p>The pivotal question, however, is whether Betfair increases the amount of corruption in racing, or simply shines an unforgiving light on what was already there, often thanks only to the deliberate connivance of the same \"traditional\" bookmakers who are now so resentful as the exchanges move on to their territory. </p> <p>My personal opinion tends far more towards the latter position. If you want to crunch cockroaches in a dark kitchen, it is always helpful to have a torch, and that is what Betfair's detailed betting records have started to provide. </p> <p>The trusty size 12 boot, meanwhile, comes courtesy of Paul Scotney, who has done more to root out corruption in his 10 months as the Jockey Club's head of security than the previous regime had managed in 10 years. </p> <p>Since agreeing the Memorandum of Understanding with Betfair that grants Scotney's department access to the exchange's records, two owners - including Miles Rodgers, another of the individuals arrested yesterday - have been thrown out of the sport for laying their own horses. </p> <p>The high-profile case of Hillside Girl, who was allegedly run when lame to profit on the exchanges, will also be resolved next week, with the licences and livelihoods of four people hanging in the balance. </p> <p>Scotney and Betfair are not quite Regan and Carter, but as a team they must be starting to instil the same sort of fear in racing's villains. </p> <p>Without the need for any rough stuff, but without any fear or favour, they have started to follow the money trails towards sources of corruption that the betting exchanges can highlight. </p> <p>Play fast and loose on Betfair's racing markets and it is now not merely a faint chance, but rather a distinct possibility that one of these mornings \"Big Paul\" and his men will come knocking at your door. </p> <p>And the penalty for any trainer or jockey who is caught out should not be underestimated. Losing your licence is not like being sacked from a normal job. In the tight-knit world of racing, it is more like excommunication. </p> <p>Which is why the initial reaction of many racing fans to yesterday's news, that it meant more dreadful publicity than the sport could bear, may not have been the correct one. </p> <p>If Kieren Fallon is charged and found guilty of fraud, it will be a bitter blow, not least for the many punters who have always trusted the six-times champion Flat jockey with their money. A brilliant career will have been brought to a sad end by what would be the self-destructive greed of a man who is already a millionaire many times over. </p> <p>But it will be a clear sign too that racing has finally got serious about rooting out corruption and, with the police to back them up when necessary, has the muscle to do so. </p> <p>Even if, as is perfectly possible, Fallon is released without charge, the very fact that he was arrested at all will give every young jockey in the country pause for thought. </p> <p>\"If they can pick on Kieren,\" they will tell themselves, \"then they won't think twice about picking on me.\" If that idea becomes embedded in the weighing room, then for all the bad PR in the short term, racing can only emerge as a cleaner and better sport. </p>"
