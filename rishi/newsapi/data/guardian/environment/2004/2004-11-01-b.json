  "Yasser Arafat has sustained an entire cottage industry of biographers and experts during his long and eventful career, but the book that comes closest to explaining what makes him tick is by the veteran Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein. <p>The Mystery of Arafat was published 10 years ago, but it is still an indispensable guide to \"Mr Palestine\" and especially to how, as long ago as the 60s, he cultivated his iconic image: keffiyeh headscarf, three-day stubble, olive-green battledress and pistol on hip. </p> <p>Old and sick he may be, but there was more than a hint of the theatrical when Arafat - sans keffiyeh but grinning bravely for the cameras - left the carefully preserved ruins of his Ramallah HQ last week en route for a Paris hospital. </p> <p>It was the same in 1992: his plane was about to make a hazardous crash-landing in the Libyan desert, so he took off his tracksuit and put on his uniform and holster - determined, if killed or injured, to keep up appearances to the end. </p> <p>Reports of Arafat's demise turn out to have been exaggerated, though the excitement is an indicator of the power of the global brand he has become. But it is clear that whoever does succeed him, and whenever they do so, none will wield his unique, symbolic authority, somehow respected even by his many bitter enemies. </p> <p>And while it may be true that without the man Palestinians call Abu Ammar, Ariel Sharon and a re-elected George Bush would no longer be able to argue that there is no \"partner for peace\", the danger of factional fighting and warlordism in the disconnected territories of the West Bank, Gaza and the refugee camps of Lebanon and the wider diaspora will be very real. </p> <p>Arafat's illness underlines his extraordinary staying power. Every journalist who has ever covered the Middle East has written him off at some time. I confess to burying him first in 1983 after he survived Israel's invasion of Lebanon only to face a rebellion fomented by the Syrians. </p> <p>Next time I saw him in action, he was manoeuvring to hold the PLO together with his stirring but windy rhetoric at the 1987 Palestine National Council in Algiers, months before the outbreak of the first intifada. It was that popular uprising, more effective than years of armed struggle, that led him finally to recognise Israel and renounce terrorism, two fundamental moves he has never withdrawn. </p> <p>Arafat was born for the long haul, and things were looking up in his Tunisian exile in December 1992, just prior to the start of the back-channel negotiations that led to his ill-fated Oslo deal with Yitzhak Rabin. </p> <p>It was hard, as ever, to know exactly what he meant when I spoke to him then: the overheated language masked any obvious substance. He was effusive, friendly, but evasive, a parody of himself. (At the end of the interview, he gave me a mother-of-pearl box with red plush lining - the sort made in Bethlehem before tourism collapsed. Back in Europe, boarding a flight to Tel Aviv, the El Al security man asked: \"Has anyone given you anything to take with you?\" Times were changing, but I decided not to say I had a gift from the PLO leader in my suitcase). </p> <p>Arafat's legacy will be the subject of many books. The moment is certainly past when the world was persuaded, as Rubinstein put it, \"that Arafat was the Palestinian problem and accordingly he and only he could solve it\". His flaws and failures weakened the Palestinian Authority and boosted Islamist rivals such as Hamas. </p> <p>But there is no mystery about one central point: in the 60s and 70s, his people were refugees whose national rights were barely recognised. \"Only in Palestine,\" an astute US commentator wrote then, \"is it still possible for liberals to cheer the cowboys gunning down the Indians or pushing them back into the badlands.\" As Israelis now know to their cost, that is no longer remotely true.</p>",
  "<p>Instead of packing, say, the shallow pleasures of The Da Vinci Code, Brian has taken the memoirs of Antipodean explorer Charles Sturt with him on holiday to the Australian Bush. This is hardly the most comforting reading once he has been bitten by a snake and his car is stuck in sand. \"All nature around us is dead,\" he reads, in Jane Rogers' gritty <strong> Friday Play - Inland Sea</strong> (Radio 4). \"If [rain] comes not, our retreat homewards will be cut off and our destruction inevitable.\" </p> <p>Brian and his wife Maura - played with ferocious intensity by Anton Lesser and Niamh Cusack - are taking care of their own destruction. As the adder's venom seeps into his bloodstream, so the poison spreads through their relationship. You just knew this wasn't going to be a shiny, happy trip. \"We've got two mobiles, state-of-the-art vehicles, extra petrol, 20 litres of water, food to last a week. What the hell do you imagine could go wrong?\" Brian asks. Try just about everything. </p> <p>Cusack was especially good as the put-upon wife of a composer with a writing block, a drink problem and a secret girlfriend who is mother to his even-more-secret child. Rogers' writing was fierce and unsentimental, and it all felt horribly, claustrophobically real. \"You're going to have to try to relax,\" Maura tells Brian. \"With ants crawling up my arse and flies feasting on my face and snake venom spreading through my system?\" he replies. These matters, it turns out, are the least of his worries. </p> <p>Enid Blyton, you sensed from <strong>Blyton in Bombay</strong> (Radio 4), would have had a no-nonsense attitude to such scenarios. This was a gentle, enthralling documentary about the author's enduring popularity among Indian's middle-classes. One grown man recalled the horror he felt on receiving a standard reply, typed and with a signature that had clearly been stamped, to his third letter (\"I almost felt jilted\"). The first two had been hand- written cards and Blyton had even set him up with a British pen pal. \"I wrote a letter to Enid Blyton and she gave me your address,\" the first letter began. Can you imagine JK Rowling finding time for such match-making? </p> <p>Since taking on an allotment, I'm glued to <strong> Jeremy Vine</strong> (Radio 2) on a Friday, with live reports from a plot in Wales. It sounded especially grim last week, for all the high drama of a parsnip being harvested live on-air (\"just whistle amongst yourselves,\" the digger advised, placing his mobile phone on the soggy soil). Global warming has affected the parsnips (\"he's not looking too happy\") and made everything else very squidgy. \"I'm here on a cold Rhondda hillside,\" Terry said, \"with two wellingtons full of water.\" And they call it the good life.</p>",
  "I live in Washington, DC now, after nearly 30 years of living in New York City. Washington is built on swampland, literally, an origin that signals its character. It was designed to look like Paris. There are boulevards, monuments, museums, along with a dangerous, desolate, and impoverished inner city, still not rebuilt from the 1968 riots triggered by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Citizens of Washington, DC do not have any voting representatives in Congress. There was and is no state entity as such. Washington is a district, not quite a city, sleepy and southern in its habits, not fully enfranchised. We are not so much citizens as members of a colony, like Guam or Puerto Rico. <p>Yet this is a swamp devoted to politics. The players in this company town live on political barter, while amassing personal fortunes for themselves. I am not a player. I experience instead an adumbrated form of democracy, articulated most eloquently by the invitation every four years to vote for a president and vice-president. </p> <p>I accept the vote as a primitive expression of democracy out of respect for my suffragist foremothers. They fought so hard for women's civil and economic equality and ended up settling for the vote. I measure this up against a rape or an honour killing and I don't think it counts for much. </p> <p>Anyway, I am supposed to vote for one or the other of two men who are differentiated by style, not by policies. They have more in common with each other than either has with me. They also both lie. </p> <p>I'm voting for John Kerry, and I'm not happy. In 1972, during the Vietnam war, I refused to vote for anti-war candidate George McGovern, even though I had spent most of my young adult life in opposition to the war, because he was anti-abortion. I refused to vote for \u00fcber-liberal, pro-civil rights, all-around good guy Hubert Humphrey because he did nothing while demonstrators were being beaten up by police in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic Convention. In 1976, while my feminist colleagues organised for Jimmy Carter, I refused to sign petitions or vote for him because he was anti-abortion. The first thing Carter did when elected was to have his health secretary end all federally funded abortions, which was the only access poor women had. (Yes, my sisters learned something. Now the legality of abortion, not access, is the feminist litmus test - too little, too late). </p> <p>In 1984, I couldn't bear Geraldine Ferraro as the first woman vice-presidential candidate because her husband, John Zaccaro, owned a warehouse filled with pornography. The Washington Post reported that year that Zaccaro refused to comply with requests for full income and tax disclosures. I voted the first time (in 1992) for Bill Clinton because, on a lecture tour in Texas, I heard George HW Bush - known fondly in retrospect as 41 (George W being 43) - accuse Clinton of un-American activities, which he inferred from a trip Clinton had made to Moscow when he was at Oxford as a student. In 2000, I voted for Ralph Nader. I don't recommend myself as a model for citizenship, except to say that I have always abhorred the lesser-of-two-evils philosophy, and Al Gore let himself be dressed by Naomi Wolf. </p> <p>I couldn't be bothered to vote most of the time because it was almost always a choice between the corrupt and the more corrupt. There is the primordial sludge and then the more pristine amoeba. My guy's the amoeba; the other guy's the sludge. This is a recipe for madness, otherwise known as the American president. </p> <p>Of course, who could have imagined September 11, 2001, and Bush, the war president? And if one were to strike out against state sponsors of terrorism, who could imagine mistaking Iraq for Iran, even though in English they appear nearly the same? This is a George W kind of error. </p> <p>Let me tell you about my amoeba, Kerry. He voted for the Iraq war. Asked if he, knowing then what he knows now (no weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear arsenal), would have voted differently, he said no. He is vaguely committed to putting more soldiers on the ground. He showed up for his political convention as a Vietnam war combatant, not as an anti-war protester, which he was, with honour. He is a multi-millionaire married to a multi-billionaire. His running mate, John Edwards, is more pro-war than he is, less ambivalent and less ambiguous. Edwards is also a multi-millionaire. </p> <p>My amoeba talks about the middle-class; he has conveniently forgotten about the poor. (Edwards used to talk about poverty before he was absorbed into Kerry's attempted seduction of the middle class.) </p> <p>My amoeba calls prostitution a \"nuisance\" instead of a crime against women. Some 25 years ago my amoeba was a prosecutor. He prosecuted at least one rape case, which he won. He was responsible for setting up counselling for rape victims. This was precocious and superb. </p> <p>Fast forward: two weeks before the election, my amoeba recognised that American women make 76 cents against every male dollar and decided to draw attention to this fact. Such is the gratitude of women that my amoeba beats the primordial sludge by as much as 10 percentage points among women in the subsequent polls. He is especially popular with single women who, needless to say, have to support themselves. </p> <p>My amoeba promises improvement. He will support pay-equity legislation. (Have I been in a deep sleep? Is this 1970?) In the parlance of his campaign, he has a plan. He keeps the specifics to himself. He will also raise the minimum wage over several years from $5.15 an hour to $7 an hour which, his campaign reckons, will give 9.2 million women another $3,800 a year. How pathetic is that? He has a plan for health insurance and another plan to produce jobs and a plan to protect social security, that tiny safety net that older Americans, especially women, have against utter poverty. In any other year, this wouldn't be enough to differentiate him from the primordial sludge, because mostly it is not true. It's either the Iraq war or health care, not both. </p> <p>Now look at what George W offers me. First, he gives me his middle initial: \"W is for Women\". I don't want his initial inscribed on me. I find the idea repugnant. He does not recognise the pay differential between men and women. On the other hand, he is against sex trafficking and has said so when addressing the UN. He has strong evangelical support for this position. He is for bringing equality to women in the Arab and Islamic world. I may want it and work for it in the US, but he and his most anti-feminist rightwing advisors, including David Frum and Richard Perle, want women's liberation in the Gulf region, and I do not mean the Gulf of Mexico. Anywhere but here seems to be the general plan. </p> <p>And what is the price for these women's rights? It's a small one. Many bombs must fall and many innocents must die. </p> <p>The Bush/Cheney argument for reelection comes down to this: in Iraq we have created a new site for terrorists and they are so busy there that they won't come here. Vote for us and you'll be safe. Vote for Kerry/Edwards and you'll likely die. One has a choice between massacres there or here. Vote Bush/Cheney. Choose there. </p> <p>Despite the American disdain for irony, electoral politics in the US is nothing if not a lesson in irony. Richard Nixon the anti-communist went to China and ended the Vietnam war. Clinton, prince of Democratic post-liberals, joined with Republicans - in fact, led them - to get African-American single mothers kicked off welfare and to create political cover for those politicians abandoning the poor. He then had the honour of being proclaimed, by Toni Morrison no less, the first black president. And, in this land of political hallucination, maybe he was. He also may be the only black president. </p> <p>What Kerry will do is this: he will get European and even Arab allies to pony up in Iraq; he will intensify the war there; he will bring in more troops. This policy will make it impossible for the Democratic candidate who follows him, or he himself if he runs again, to have anything but a pro-war policy. A rightwing Republican, maybe even a woman, plain-spoken and Reaganesque (or Thatcheresque), will triumph by promising an end to the Iraq war either four or eight years from now. He or she will deliver because the war will be over and the US and its many allies will have lost. This will be another generation's Vietnam with the blame having a certain global quality. As at his convention, Kerry the combatant will have trumped Kerry the anti-war protester. </p> <p>So why is it that I'm voting for Kerry? Oh, right, it's because my Massachusetts amoeba is better than Texas primordial sludge. Make no mistake: I have regional emotions. When someone from Massachusetts, the centre of abolitionist activism, and someone from Texas, in our day and age a symbol of the Confederacy, mix it up, our civil war is being refought. Kerry represents those brilliant abolitionists - and he does it badly. Shame on him. </p> <p>The thing is that I'm scared to death that Bush will win. If Bush wins, we get more terror, charmingly diverted to countries not the United States. I call that a plan. I admire its simplicity. Who said that boy is stupid? Oh, I did, a few paragraphs up: the whole Iraq/Iran confusion. Of course, being dyslexic is not the same as being stupid. </p> <p>The Bush/Cheney plan is the equivalent of a moral sewer. I don't want to roll in that dirt. It's someone else's blood and it doesn't wash off (cf the Scottish play). </p> <p>We dream, some of us, of being able to be good in a better world. The morally reprehensible - the Bush/ Cheney strategy - smacks us between the eyes; and then, and only then, do we vote for the lesser of two evils. But don't forget that they are two evils. Sick to my stomach because he will stay in Iraq, I'm voting for John Kerry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrea Dworkin's most recent book is Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant.</p>",
  "<b> What exactly is happening there? </b> <br>Few people outside Uganda know that in the north the government is fighting a fanatical and murderous cult - the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) - whose fighting force is made up in large part of abducted children ... The LRA is led by the self-proclaimed prophet Joseph Kony ... He and most of his fighters are from the Acholi tribe, as are most of their victims. Mr Kony says he is guided by spirits who tell him what to do and whom to kill. <p> Tim Judah in the Independent, October 23 </p> <p> <b> What does the LRA want? </b> <br>The rebellion grew from the grievances of the Acholi people, who believed that President Yoweri Museveni's government was discriminating against them. Mr Kony merged this resentment with religious fanaticism. But he never offered coherent demands, pledging only to rule according to the Ten Commandments. Today, his rebellion has no claim except rebellion itself ... If Mr Kony surrendered, war would end. </p> <p> David Blair in the Daily Telegraph, October 6 </p> <p> <b> How many Ugandans are affected? </b><br> In addition to the 20,000 kidnapped children - who are forced to serve as either soldiers or sex slaves for rebel commanders - around 1.6 million people have been displaced ... The LRA has been fighting since 1986 to oust the government ... in a civil war that has left an estimated 100,000 dead. </p> <p> From a report in New Vision, Uganda, October 23 </p> <p> <b> Why is this war particularly barbaric? </b> <br>Children ... have suffered as a result of this conflict ... Children who were bayoneted or beaten to death on a whim, children who died of disease from polluted water or hunger, children who were shot as they were driven forward to attack government forces ... One of the world's most protracted, cruel and bloody humanitarian crises, this conflict is fuelled by the vulnerability of children and global indifference. </p> <p> Tim Caste in the Age, Australia, October 25 </p> <p> <b> What can the UN do? </b> <br>We have a problem on our hands and we could do with some help. People are starving in the displaced people's camps and [could] do with some food and medical aid from the UN ... The ultimate test for the UN top dogs will be if they can put their diplomacy in top gear and convince Kampala to accept foreign troops into northern Uganda - like they have done in Darfur - and sort out the needs of the common man. </p> <p> From an editorial in the Monitor, Uganda, October 24 </p> <p> <b> Why has the war against the LRA gone on so long? </b><br> The war [has] been prolonged by the support, albeit now waning, given to the rebels by Sudan, where the LRA has bases ... \"In the recent past, we have heard about corruption in the army, which has had an impact on its performance,\" explained one diplomat [in Uganda]. </p> <p> From an Agence France-Presse report, October 22 </p> <p> <b> Is fighting really on the wane? </b><br> While the [Ugandan] army has sounded increasingly confident in recent weeks, aid workers point out that the conflict is far from over and that small bands of LRA fighters still launch brutal attacks against civilians in camps, villages and on roads. </p> <p> From a Reuters report, September 29 </p> <p> <b> Have there been peace talks?</b><br> Most people living in northern Uganda call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, partly because the military option has failed before. But they also want their abducted sons and daughters back home alive, whatever crimes they have been forced to commit. Attempts to hold peace talks have been made before but with so little trust between the two sides, they have broken down ... For now the government seems determined to fight on. </p> <p> From BBC News online, October 22 </p> <p> <b> Is there any cause for hope?</b> <br> The surrender of [some LRA soldiers] ... may be a sign that Uganda's 17-year war ... is finally coming to an end. [The] government's amnesty programme was established in 2000. As of April this year, more than 6,500 LRA rebels have emerged from the bush to join the programme - with a further 823 signing up between June and August 2004. </p> <p> From an Inter Press Service report, South Africa, September 27</p>",

  "Do I have to be bumped into quite so much? I know there is a global population explosion. But it can't yet be so bad that I need to be jostled into the gutter on a crowded street, or pushed out of the way in the rush of young people towards the pub door. Do I have to go into aggressive/assertive mode simply to hold my place in a queue? I know the English are famed for the apparent orderliness of their queueing customs. But I'm increasingly aware that the rules are being subverted. In supermarket checkouts and airport check-ins, people are quietly on the lookout for signs of weakness, and if you indicate less than dedicated attention to holding your place, they will sneak in ahead of you, no apologies made. <p>Some more questions: do I have to enjoy a quiet morning coffee with friends against the cacophonous uproar of toddlers quite out of control, screaming their heads off while mothers confer together, sublimely indifferent to their responsibilities? </p> <p>Do I have to give way, even in a traffic jam, to all and sundry motorists who would like to press in ahead of me for the benefit of a few seconds saved on their journey? Give way graciously and my modest concession is seized on as an excuse by others. I can get left well and truly behind, which in all honesty is probably the safest place to be. </p> <p>So don't good manners matter any more? Or do they need to be rethought for our own day? I think the latter. It's easy to grow lyrical and nostalgic about how manners used to be. The times when quiet-spoken children asked, \"Please may I leave the table,\" always said \"please\" and \"thank you\" and little more. When men opened doors for women they didn't know and raised their hats to those they did. These were social conventions that have gone the way of John Major's vision - with a nod towards George Orwell - of a spinster cycling to church in the early morning, of warm beer and cricket on village greens. Those were times of deference and pecking orders. Formal manners were, among other things, the public acknowledgment of that forelock-tugging society. Those days are not coming back. And we don't want them back. Despite their surface charm, they were servile, hypocritical and repressive. </p> <p>But it's hard not to think that we've thrown out something quite fundamental with the bathwater. We now have shreds of the old order lingering among the older generations while chaos prevails among the young. Such is the ambiguity of manners - are they a sign of weakness, of conformity? - that rudeness has become smart. In-your-face insults have become the stuff of comedy. Telling how you told some old biddy to fuck off sets the crowd on a roar. Bold, direct and offensive is the new style. No hypocrisy there, certainly. No charm either. As social behaviour, it's a dead end. It taints both the insulter and the insulted. Who needs it? </p> <p>We can take as read the social context. The cliches come tumbling out: an alienated society, no communities, no job security, the break-up of families and industries. A place where people feel without worth in a culture that values style over content. Global uncertainties, materialist values, you could even add the decline of religion. Indeed, religion had a fundamental take on manners, expressed by Christianity as: \"Love thy neighbour as thyself.\" There's truth in all these cliches, of course, but the trouble is, they're so threadbare from overuse, they aren't much help. It might be better to turn the problem on its head and examine how manners might actually be something we want. </p> <p>Take noise. The world has manifestly got louder. Technology is spewing out ways to listen to records, radio channels, piped music, your pals in Thailand, the boss back at base. Silence has become precious. The interface between the two needs the intercession of good manners. There are rules to help out: railway carriages that are supposed to be mobile-free, pubs and bars that don't have Muzak. But just asking permission of someone who might be sensitive to the noise you want to make could oil the social hinges. We need new modes of behaviour in enclosed places, so that everyone ends up feeling comfortable, no one feels their view has been trampled, and those crazy for decibels find their own - separate - space. </p> <p>Next, children. One of the joys of parenthood is looking upon your offspring as little angels. An adjacent pleasure is having others share that view. The interface between the two will depend on their manners. Forget the piano lessons, and ballet classes, neglect football practice and the school choir. A fluency with daily manners is one of the finest gifts you can give your children, and for that you need to start young. Rewarding the pleases and thank-yous of toddlers is just the beginning. The matter of how to eat sitting at a table with other people might come as a novelty these days. And whatever happened to that old hint: FHB (family hold back) whenever food was shared with visitors? Certainly, the new manners have to move with the times - and how many families eat round the table any more? But there have to be ways of encouraging them not to splay food around, to chew with their mouths shut, and join a civilised and shared conversation without young people feeling you're infringing their right to be who they are. And if they, perversely, insist on that distorted right, then you should know you're bringing up yobs. </p> <p>This is two-way traffic, of course. Shouting at a child is a display of extreme rudeness, and self-perpetuating. A recent crop of reality shows on television - one about an old-style nanny, another re-creating schooling of the 1960s - demonstrated both the futility of shouting, and how much more successful reasoned but firm instruction always is. Besides, when is shouting something any of us need to hear? </p> <p>Manners take time. But we live in a world in a frantic hurry. Pause for breath and the herd will trample you in the dust. Hesitate at the checkout and someone will overtake. But so what? A world where there was less elbowing, less crushing, more space given, more words exchanged would be a vast improvement in our quality of life. If it sprang from a genuine empathy with how other people felt, it might short-cut the whole rickety business of petty complaints, minor court cases, Asbos and street confrontations. We need manners so that teachers aren't afraid of their pupils, motorists don't get chippy with other drivers, and the relationships between men and women recover a certain grace to add to sexual freedom. Manners are something we positively want. The pendulum has swung too far from the old-style craven deference to a chaotic mess of insult and bravado. It's time to bring back a new style of good manners, for all and by all. Put it in the manifesto, and I'll vote for it.</p>",
  "<p>4.45PM BREAKING NEWS!</p> <p>Berti Vogts has resigned as Scotland manager. In a statement, he said that the abuse he received from the press and the public made his mind up to quit. \"From my point of view, the decision has been made with a heavy heart as I have enjoyed my tenure at the hub and the warmth that I have experienced from the people of Scotland,\" Vogts said. \"But I must say that the major factor in this decision has been the disgraceful abuse that I have suffered, especially of late.</p> <p>\"It has degenerated into a physical nature, especially on recent occasions where I have been spat upon,\" Vogts added. \"This is not acceptable behaviour in a civilised society and I know that the vast majority of Scots will join me in my disgust at this act by a very tiny minority. The abuse is something that people in public life must get used to, but now it is having a serious effect upon my home life. I cannot sit by, as no-one would, to be involved in the abuse that I have to endure.\"</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>GET OVER IT</strong></p> <p>The Fiver has always struggled to let sleeping dogs lie. We've never forgotten the time when some wag swapped our Colgate with Granny Fiver's piles cream, and we still can't walk past a snoozing mongrel without gently tickling its swingers. And we're not the only ones: for Old Trafford's Battle of the Buffet has sparked the most ridiculous fallout since Jordan and Jodie Marsh last spotted some oncoming paparazzi. It's now eight days since Sir Alex Ferguson got drenched - and though Arsenal say the matter is closed, one man's revenge campaign is only just warming up.</p> <p>\"We are finished with it,\" said Arsene Wenger, as a flunky busily swept a load of dirt under the nearest carpet. \"We have spoken at the highest level and agree the matter is closed,\" concurred the Arsenal chairman David Dein. Clearly, however, Sir Alex doesn't mix in the upper echelons any more (insert your own 'you only need look at the Premiership table' gag here) - because he wants to see it through to the bitter end.</p> <p>Like a once-great emperor who is losing it completely, Fergie has demanded the dusters of Thierry Henry (for accidentally kneeing Gabriel Heinze) and Dennis Bergkamp (for cuffing Alan Smith round the head) on a plate. And while he has a point on the second one - in the pedantic modern age, it was a red-card offence - you can't help feel this is the most undignified behaviour by a Scotsman since Trainspotting's Spud thought it was a good idea to wash his girlfriend's bedsheets on the sly.

  "<p>Few things in life jolt our self-awareness or sense of security more than when we become victims of crime. Worryingly though, falling prey to offenders is no longer confined to dark alleyways or stumbling into the wrong part of town, as office workers are beginning to discover. </p> <p>According to insurance group AXA, UK offices have recently suffered an unprecedented surge in crime. Figures from the AXA Business Crime Index reveal that crime-related insurance settlements increased by a massive 19.3% in the second quarter of 2004. Incidences of theft involving cash and computers, malicious damage and violent crime have all risen, with businesses in Bradford, Birmingham, Nottingham and Bath making the greatest number of crime-related claims. </p> <p>However, these figures are more than insurance statistics. They reveal the extent to which office workers are under threat just by doing their jobs. Sheela Bates, account manager with a music PR company, knows this better than most. \"The first crime we had was in June this year,\" she says. \"Two men came into the office at the end of the day dressed in sunglasses and motorcycle helmets. They punched one of my colleagues in the face and grabbed my mobile phone and wallet. They were really abusive and threatened to hit me if I didn't help them unplug the laptops they wanted. They got away with three laptops, two mobile phones and two wallets. It was the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me.\" </p> <p>However for Bates and her colleagues it didn't end there. Three weeks later, the perpetrators returned during the night and stole the replacement laptops. They were seen again a couple of months ago as they were checking out the new security measures that the company has now put in place. </p> <p>The average cost of crime per business now stands at \u00a38,000 per year, but of course the consequences of criminal activities stretch beyond the financial. The emotional cost is far greater than any investment in new laptops. Experiencing crime in the workplace is reputed to lose UK businesses billions of hours of worktime through sickness every year. </p> <p>The stress placed upon victims, their colleagues and employers in the aftermath of a crime can manifest itself in several ways. Physical reactions such as panic attacks, headaches and sleeplessness are often coupled with feelings of disbelief, guilt and isolation. Together, they form a potent brew that erodes both motivation and productivity. </p> <p>No one understands this more than Victim Support. It sees workplace crime as such an issue that it recently launched Workforce, helping businesses manage the impact of violence on the workplace. \"This is a massive problem,\" says Ray Wilkinson, Workforce CEO. \"Many businesses don't understand the impact crime can have upon the working day. Not enough is done to support victims of crime in the office. There is a direct link between how staff are treated and how they, in turn, treat their customers. That has an obvious impact upon the performance of the business. The worst thing that can happen is that people accept this as an ordinary part of working life.\" </p> <p>According to Victim Support, figures from the retail sector alone equate to one worker being assaulted or threatened every working minute. This means that many businesses have been forced to initiate employee assistance programmes. However, these are often found to be wanting. Victims of crime usually need to be surrounded by the familiar which is where most employer policies instantly fall down. Often victims receive offers of help from a HR department they otherwise never hear from. But research shows that what victims really want is for their supervisor to check that they are OK, call a family member for them, or arrange for them to have time off. In addition to this, they need emotional support and information about what happens next, from police involvement through to improved security measures. </p> <p>For the British Chamber of Commerce, though, employers who poorly support workplace victims simply exacerbate the impact of the crime. \"Just imagine what it is like to go to work only to find a smashed window or damaged vehicle,\" says Steven Hill, BCC policy adviser. \"Some firms have even closed down because the impact of crime is too great for them. Crime against business is often seen as victimless but this isn't the case at all. The damage being done to workers is actually the hidden cost of crime.\" He urges businesses to think ahead. \"They think that crime will never happen to them and it is only when it does that they realise the true impact. They must take proactive steps while they can.\" </p> <p>These steps can include locking windows and doors, monitoring stock, installing alarms, lighting and CCTV, as well as securing boundaries, but responsibility for security doesn't lie with the employer alone. It is also up to employees to ensure that they create a safe working environment, not just to stop crime occurring but to reduce its impact if it does happen. </p> <p>Home Office advice for employees is that they avoid working alone and that inexperienced members of staff are teamed with those who know the ropes. As well as being alert to suspicious behaviour, recruitment procedures should be stringent, especially when it comes to checking references. It's also important that all office workers take responsibility for locking cupboards and setting alarms. Never assume that someone else will do it. </p> <p>But the best way for office workers to help prevent crime is to work as a team. Discuss what it takes to make the office more secure and implement it. Get training so that you are all familiar with warning signs such as hostile behaviour and practise role-playing at keeping calm if the worst should happen. </p> <p>It is also important to work with other offices in the area. Set up local partnerships and involve the police. Then, as a group, you are in a good position to campaign against any anti-social behaviour that occurs in the locality. When it comes to teamwork, though, the Security Industry Authority has it nailed. It agrees that everyone in the office has a responsibility for maintaining security but sees the use of security guards as a vital part of keeping crime at arm's length. </p> <p>Over the next year the SIA will be introducing individual licensing for security guards and a hallmark scheme for accredited companies. This means that offices can have extra confidence in the security they employ. \"Most businesses don't take office security seriously enough,\" says John Saunders, chief executive of the SIA. \"Businesses should be consulting with security companies to agree a complete solution. It sounds dull, but it shouldn't be. You wouldn't allow a stranger to walk around your premises by day so why should you allow a stranger to police them by night?\" The SIA suggests asking security companies for references and membership of trade associations as well as blunt questions about their businesses and staff. It's just one more way of keeping crime at bay. </p> <p>This comes too late for Sheela Bates, though. Her brush with crime will stay with her for some time yet. Her company has now installed a grille over the front door as well as a new alarm system and two panic buttons, all for an office with only six desks. </p> <p>But Bates is still finding it difficult to adjust. \"I used to work in the office until late into the night but not any more,\" she says. \"If I hear a motorbike, my heart jumps and I get scared when I am walking on my own. The way the thieves were dressed meant that none of us got a description, so I worry that they could be anywhere. I get angry when I think about what they did. I should have hit or kicked them, but I was in shock because I just didn't expect that to happen in my office. At the end of the day, though, I know that it's self-preservation that counts.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Burberry brand has become so synonymous with so-called 'chav' culture that the one-time plaid check addict Daniella Westbrook probably doesn't even wear it anymore.</p> <p>Not that the most British of luxury labels seems remotely worried. In the past seven years since Rose Marie Bravo was placed in charge, the 148-year-old company has grown from a \u00a3200m business to a market capitalisation of \u00a32bn and delivered revenues up 14% in the six months to September.</p> <p>The much-predicted collapse of Burberry at the hands of a hijacking by football hooligans and D-list soap stars has not materialised and the \"nay-sayers\" who said Ms Bravo over-popularised the brand owe her an apology, according to one marketing expert.</p> <p>Far from shying away from its much-copied camel, red, black and white plaid check, Burberry has extended the pattern into a pink colourway and added a \"scratch-look\" design and striped variants.</p> <p>And although the check features on only 8% of Burberry's products, it is the first thing to greet visitors to the company's website and adorns the company's latest fragrance, Burberry Brit. Burberry appears to be far from ashamed of the acquired naffness of its iconic logo.</p> <p>Ms Bravo, an American, has managed to negate the effect of every luxury brand's nightmare - rampant appropriation by mainstream culture. She has stuck to her guns despite heavy criticism and lampooning from the media. The Sun recently ran a spate of chav-themed features with its pages emblazoned with the Burberry check.</p> <p>Even other companies are piggy-backing on the Burberry bandwagon. Mobile phone company 3 has dressed one of its advertising characters in a Burberry cap and gold earrings in a bid to appeal to bling-obsessed youngsters.</p> <p>But while Burberry will not comment about the downmarket association its brand has acquired in Britain, a source close to the company said it is not seen as a problem and that Britain is only one small region in the 26 countries Burberry operates.</p> <p>And while a large internal anti-counterfeit team operates from Burberry's Haymarket headquarters ready to pounce on any fakers, the company wants to be seen as an \"accessible luxury\" brand, which is \"welcoming\" and \"democratic\" with a wide appeal.</p> <p>In other words, it is reacting in the opposite way to how a luxury brand might be expected to - it is steadfastly refusing to express outrage that its high-class image has been tarnished by downmarket associations and instead is embracing its customers whether they hail from council estate or country estate.</p> <p>Mark Ritson, assistant professor of marketing at the London Business School, has for three years been a vocal advocate of the opinion that the mainstream hijacking of Burberry irrevocably damaged the brand. Only now he's changed his mind.</p> <p>\"I have said for three years that they were not going to succeed, that Rose Marie Bravo had done a nice job of growing the brand and fattening it up for the future. But in the last 12 months I've realised she's a lot smarter than she's been given credit for,\" said Mr Ritson.</p> <p>\"They haven't gone tits up. The UK is not at all representative of the rest of Burberry's marketplace. If London was the world they would be knackered, but it's not. They have maintained their global strength.</p> <p>And Burberry's strategy of not trying to stop downmarket customers championing the brand has prevented it coming across as snobbish.</p> <p>\"The media has done Rose Marie Bravo a disservice. She has stuck by the brand, which is not just a sign of a good leader but the sign of a good brand leader,\" said Mr Ritson. </p> <p>\"The stereotyped story that Burberry is in trouble is simply not going to happen and the people who were the nay-sayers before, like me, owe [Ms Bravo] an apology.\"</p> <p>Rita Clifton, the chairman of Interbrand, the company responsible for the branding of clients including Marks &amp; Spencer and P&amp;O, said UK customers are particularly cynical when it comes to logos, labels and luxury but Burberry's business must be set in its successful global context.</p> <p>\"Every luxury brand wants three things: a strong, well-crafted product, a strong brand experience, and the right people to be seen loving and buying it.</p> <p>\"But the one thing a brand owner can't control is who buys it. When Burberry relaunched it did two things to allow the chav phenomenon to happen. It used Kate Moss in its advertising and confused the check for its logo.</p> <p>\"Moss is not upmarket. She is aspirational for a whole range of women, highly accessible and has helped democratise luxury brands. She brought instant accessibility that was not there before and an instant volume [sales] hit.</p> <p>\"Burberry also got confused about the check - it allowed it to get wrapped up with its logo which became ubiquitous,\" said Ms Clifton.</p> <p>But the fact that Burberry is now \"playing\" with the colour and design of the check is \"interesting and encouraging\", according to Ms Clifton. She cited Louis Vuitton as having done a similar thing successfully with its best-ever seller, the multicoloured logo handbag.</p> <p>But she believes Burberry's move to expand the brand upmarket with the top-end Burberry Prorsum label may prove difficult.</p> <p>Burberry has three labels: the cat-walk label Prorsum, which includes very little check; Burberry London, the most well-known and largest range, which includes the famous check-lined trenchcoats; and Thomas Burberry, for 16- to 25-year-olds.</p> <p>And it is Prorsum that Burberry maintains is untouched by any negative chav-effect. \"Extending a sub-brand upwards is not a tried and tested formula,\" said Ms Clifton. \"When a brand goes downmarket it is difficult to drag it up again and it is very difficult to do within a generation.\"</p> <p>But Ms Bravo, who previously ran upmarket US store Saks Fifth Avenue, has just signed a new contract keeping her at Burberry until July 2006. Her unwavering commitment to the brand, chav or not, looks to be giving her the last laugh. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>UK manufacturing picked up moderately in October but stayed well below levels recorded earlier in the year, a survey revealed today.</p> <p>The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey for October rose to 53.0, above City forecasts of 52.3. A reading of more than 50 signifies growth, while anything below shows a contraction. </p> <p>Although the survey showed a pickup in activity last month, the pace of manufacturing expansion remained substantially below that recorded in the second quarter of the year.</p> <p>Despite the improvement seen in the latest PMI survey, many companies said they were acting cautiously because of the continuing surge in the prices of raw material and the consequent pressure on profit margins. </p> <p>Record oil prices and high demand for steel and other commodities from fast-expanding economies such as China helped to force input costs up at their sharpest rate since April 1995. The input prices index hit 73.5 from 68.1 in September. </p> <p>Analysts said the fragile state of the manufacturing sector made it unlikely that the Bank of England would raise rates this week.</p> <p>\"The current softness of the manufacturing sector is another reason for the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged this week, although the central bank will not be happy to see manufacturers' output prices rising at an increased rate in October,\" Howard Archer, the chief UK economist with the consultancy Global Insight, said.</p> <p>Most City economists now believe that base rates of 4.75% have peaked for this year after five increases in borrowing costs since last November, when those costs stood at a 38-year low of 3.5%.</p> <p>Economists have trimmed their interest rate expectations amid a cooling of the housing market and growing constraints on growth, particularly oil prices.</p> <p>\"There is no denying that the manufacturing sector has come under increasing pressure in recent months from higher interest rates, very strong oil prices, and at least a temporary slowdown in global growth,\" Mr Archer said. </p> <p>\"The overall strength of sterling this year has also been a concern for the sector, although it should benefit from the pound's current weakening to a nine-month low on its trade-weighted index.\"</p>",
  "<p>In general terms an argument which involves the media is good for business as punters flock to the newsstands to get a good view of the action.

The row has come to a head with newspapers blacking out sponsors' names in an attempt to settle the argument decisively in their favour. Someone needed to do something. After all, the negotiation between the NPA - the Newspaper Publishers Association - and the dimwits who run the Football League and the FA has been plodding on for around eight years without any sign of agreement. </p> <p>Unlike formula one's global marketing Svengali, Bernie Ecclestone, the executive pen-pushers running the FA and the Football League have failed to tie up the rights surrounding their sport and are now in the ugly position of watching a large number of other people walking off with a piece of the action. This dispute is centred on a few potentially troublesome issues. Firstly the Football League is trying to claim commercial ownership of data around the sport - the fixture list and newspaper fantasy league games for example - so that it can extract money from them. </p> <p>Secondly its executives are hinting that they want to restrict photographers who take pictures of their games. Photographic agencies and newspapers make a hefty whack from the sale of sports pictures, and this is something that the FA and the Football League have failed to manage. A third area is the growing area of mobile phone- and computer-related information - goal texts, clips of players - which people want to have sent to their chunky new 3G phones. </p> <p>It is telling that the football industry has not acted earlier to deal with these issues as they appeared on the horizon like a convoy of ten tonne juggernauts. It reminds me of the music industry - another club of old boys in their cosy armchairs - who missed the opportunity to anticipate the arrival of ringtones a couple of years ago. In that instance a number of sharp media operators like Emap made a quick win by selling ringtones off the page while the record labels dithered. </p> <p>It's interesting to look at what has driven the newspapers to blacklist the sport's sponsors. It's probable that the NPA would argue that this is the best way to get the football industry to negotiate on their terms. But picking on the sponsors may prove to be a mistake. In this instance they are not the guilty party. </p> <p>It's true that the papers have been very careful and have executed their blacklisting in a way that most readers would not notice. I'd guess that the only people who have registered are the corporations who invest in football and this raises an interesting point for the sponsors. Why bother sponsoring the bloody thing if no one notices when your name is taken off? Sport sponsorship on TV and in newspapers has always enjoyed a privileged status, at some moments appearing immune to the kind of inspection and scrutiny that governs other areas. Perhaps for this reason it is appropriate for the papers to stick the boot in and mix it up a little. </p> <p>I once spent a miserable year trying to convince journalists to refer to the Bafta Awards as \"the British Academy Film &amp; TV Awards sponsored by Lloyds Bank\". It was a thankless task. Our evaluation showed that about 6% of the media were willing to do this. It used to irk me to stare at the sports pages and see logos and brand names grinning back at me. </p> <p>Much of the media landscape is available for commercial companies to rent like real estate. Why else do corporations spend millions on associating with sports teams who may end up at the bottom of the league? If the media deny them the opportunity for exposure and brand awareness that can be measured by a bunch of people like me on a chart, then the smart money will go elsewhere. Considered in this light, action being taken by the newspapers appears brave, but ultimately doomed. Perhaps they will improve their negotiation position after a few more weeks of shouting and fist waving. </p> <p>I can't help but feel that if they were serious about this issue, the newspapers would stop reporting on football matches altogether. Tell the Football League and the FA where to stick their commercial rights argument. This would quickly demonstrate where the power ultimately lies.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Julian Henry runs Henry's House, a consultancy for brands and celebrities</p>",
  "<p>When Indonesian archaeologists uncovered the remains of several ancient skeletons in a remote island cave, the discovery was hailed as introducing modern humans to an unfamiliar two-legged cousin: Homo floresiensis. Here were signs that a different species of human had evolved on an island in the Indian Ocean. Equally surprising was the news that Homo floresiensis - nicknamed Florence, after her home on the island Flores - lived as recently as 18,000 years ago, meaning that she existed at the same time as our own ancestors. </p> <p>But what most captured the world's attention was the tiny features of the adult skeletons - just one metre tall, with brains the size of a grapefruit, leading to comparisons with JRR Tolkien's hobbits. The importance of this discovery, however, is two-fold. The first is that, despite the pervasive spread of human activity, there are still surprises out there. The second and more weighty point is Florence confirms that Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were right. </p> <p>Darwin and Wallace's theory of evolution argued that species respond to their environment by adaptation. But there is little evidence that modern humans - homo sapiens - themselves evolved in that manner, and instead adapted the environment around them. The existence of Florence and her fellow hobbits challenges any dogmatic ideas of sapiens superiority, that human history is an upwardly rising scale of bigger and brainier people. Instead we are just one branch of a family tree that could as easily have flourished along other limbs. </p> <p>In the case of Florence, scientists think that her smallness is an instance of a familiar effect of evolution: \"island dwarfing\". A species cut off from its ancestors by a geographical barrier often evolves by shrinking in size as a means of survival. Assuming Florence descended from Homo erectus, then Homo floresiensis downsized to adapt to conditions. Darwin and Wallace would be delighted to see their theories illustrated in a manner showing that humans are not immune to natural selection. </p> <p>This is bad news for creationists who insist on the literal truth of the Bible. The existence of Florence shows the fact of species diversity, and the difficulty of separating human from ape on the evolutionary scale. Because Florence lived at the same time as Homo sapiens, it shows we shared the planet with other human species until relatively recently. But it also shows how little we know of the details of the descent of humankind. Florence lifts the veil a little, but there are many mysteries hidden in other caves.</p>",

  "When I started the Green Belt Movement 27 years ago - the work for which I have been awarded the Nobel peace prize - I was teaching at the University of Nairobi. I was also a member of the National Council of Women of Kenya, and I would listen to women relating the realities of their lives: their need for water, wood (for fuel) and nutritious food. I came to understand that their problems were symptoms of a poorly managed environment leading to a lack of clean drinking water, an insufficient food supply and poor health. <p>With these women, I hit on the idea of planting trees to provide food and fuel, slow soil erosion and desertification, offer shade and improve the aesthetic environment. Planting a tree is doable. Anyone can dig a hole, put in a seedling and nurture it. When one plants a tree, one feels a connection to the earth and has a stake in its survival. </p> <p>On World Environment Day in 1977, we planted seven trees at a ceremony in Nairobi, and slowly the idea took off. At first, local foresters provided seedlings, but this proved unsustainable. So we established small nurseries close to homes, which women could manage. These nurseries evolved into the Green Belt Movement, and in the process, a cadre of women became \"foresters without diplomas\". </p> <p>Along with tree-planting skills, the Green Belt Movement trained communities in human rights, democratic governance and conflict resolution. For the first time, men and women recognised their rights and responsibilities and their power to combat ecological decline, promote democracy and choose the direction of their lives. Many Green Belt members joined campaigns to protect forests and parks from the land grabs of corrupt political and business elites. </p> <p>Over the years, Green Belt members have been beaten, jailed and harassed. But rather than being deterred, we have been energised to take action. We have seen change come - most visibly, for example, the millions of trees planted on private land in Kenya that have made it possible for rural communities to meet some of their basic needs. </p> <p>The nurseries also create jobs, and because people are paid for every seedling that survives, the trees also provide a much-needed source of income. In addition, an impressive increase in people's awareness of the role of the environment in their lives and of the need to protect it has been realised. We have created a constituency demanding better management of natural resources and an end to corruption. </p> <p>In the political arena, the Green Belt Movement played a part in the reintroduction in 1992 of a multi-party system in Kenya and the expansion of democratic space. In 2002, after a prolonged struggle with dictatorship and a fragmented democracy movement, Kenyans held the first free and fair elections in a generation. </p> <p>I was elected to parliament, representing Tetu, in Nyeri district in central Kenya, where I was born and spent most of my childhood. Soon after, I was appointed assistant minister for environment and natural resources. As a member of the government, I continue to protect Kenya's remaining indigenous forests, which are rich in biodiversity and also act as \"water towers\" (ensuring that streams continue to flow and rainfall is reliable). I have also been creating a process in which communities cooperate with government officials in the restoration of forests. </p> <p> Despite the successes, this work is far from complete. Conflicts are waged over resources such as land, forests, minerals, oil and water. As the earth's resources continue to be depleted through poor management and rapacious exploitation, conflicts will flare more often, and be more difficult to contain. </p> <p>Protecting local and global environments is therefore essential for achieving lasting peace. It is critical that people around the world take action to reverse environmental degradation and its negative impacts on our lives and on other species. </p> <p>This year's peace prize has brought with it tremendous encouragement and a deep sense of accomplishment, not only to Kenya and Africa, but throughout the world. While the prize was given to me, I see it as the acknowledgement of the work of countless members of a vast, international constituency of environmentalists, pro-democracy movements and peace advocates. </p> <p>We should embrace the Nobel peace committee's recognition and use it to advance our common vision. As for me, upon receiving the news, I celebrated by planting a tree. Join me. What a global forest we would create. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Professor Wangari Maathai, an environment minister in the Kenyan government, is the winner of the 2004 Nobel peace prize </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A loyal minister assured me that Tony Blair contemplates the creation of giant casinos with a high-minded distaste. But representatives of the US gaming industry - the men who hope to make a fortune from the folly of gamblers - have convinced him that roulette, blackjack and slot machines will be a powerful ally in his campaign to reinvigorate the inner cities. The lobbyists were, the Blairite added by way of mitigation, \"at him for weeks\". The day after I was assured that the prime minister was no worse than weak-minded, the Guardian revealed the outcome of a breakfast meeting with the \"multinational chairmen's group\". Directors of British American Tobacco convinced him that a proposed public inquiry into allegations that BAT condoned smuggling should be replaced by an investigation, which, since its conclusions could not be made public, would be (indeed was) forgotten. <p>It was not the first time that Tony Blair had shown sympathy for tobacco interests. After a meeting with Bernie Ecclestone, formula one was granted temporary relief from rules that prohibited cigarette advertising. But nicotine has not been granted favours that other commodities were denied. Another minister - far removed from the casino apologist - told me that British Aerospace board members were in Downing Street so often, he suspected that they had a key to the garden gate. </p> <p>It seems that the prime minister is susceptible to lobbying. But there are no allegations of secret meetings with pensioner groups, clandestine conversations with representatives of asylum seekers or furtive trysts with homeless organisations. The prime minister only gives audiences to the rich and powerful. No doubt he will argue that he helps everyone who can move the economy forward. But the lobbying of government - from Downing Street downwards - has grown to levels that raise fundamental questions about standards in public life. </p> <p>The prime minister's personal financial integrity is beyond question. The corruption is intellectual. It is based on the belief that what is right for industry must be right for the country. Complemented by the fatuous notion that businessmen always know where their companies' best interests lie, his faith in private enterprise makes him a sucker for every executive with a Harvard Business School diploma and a big bank balance. </p> <p>He ought to know better. Two early advisers were the fallen leaders of BA and GEC. Directors are usually more accomplished at the art of protecting their own incomes than at the science of pursuing their country's economic interests, but wealth impresses Tony Blair. His personal finances are a matter for him alone. However, when prejudices that should be confined to the prime minister's lifestyle influence his attitude to policy, they become legitimate subjects for comment. The attraction of affluence makes Tony Blair Britain's principal proponent of the Protestant fallacy. He believes that wealth and virtue are indivisible. </p> <p>That view is reflected in the relaxation of rules that once required a decent period to elapse between a civil servant passing out of Whitehall and into the employment of a company that his or her department had once \"sponsored\". The willingness to blur the boundaries of propriety is a characteristic of many of the most enthusiastic \"reformers\" who rallied to New Labour 10 years ago. Proponents of \"the project\" who have taken up the dubious business of lobbying and euphemistically entitled public affairs are doing no more than reflecting the ethos the prime minister encouraged. </p> <p>Only idiots want the government or the Labour party to be antagonistic to private industry. Quite rightly, a vast majority of the economy will always be privately owned. Ministers must do their best to create an environment in which it thrives. That does not require them either to assume that it is faultless or to overlook its faults. The abiding sin of public limited companies is the belief - actually enshrined in the laws that govern them - that making the largest possible profit is their overwhelming obligation. In pursuit of that objective, they sometimes cut corners - as, allegedly, BAT did when it attempted to avoid customs duty. </p> <p>A prime minister who condones that behaviour or who does not realise it is happening diminishes himself and his government. The same is true of a prime minister who - even in the noble interests of inner-city regeneration - succumbs to the blandishments of lobbyists from Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Perhaps it is true that Tony Blair is guilty of nothing worse than gullibility and exploitation. But naivety is a strange defence for his supporters to advance. And the consequences of whatever makes him behave like this are even stranger policies for a Labour leader to advance. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Queen will this week support a United Nations conference on global warming in Germany, signalling the royal household's whole-hearted conversion to green issues. <p>Amid reports that she castigated the prime minister for failing to persuade the White House to shift its stance on the Kyoto protocol, it was revealed yesterday that Windsor Castle is to instal environmentally friendly hydro-electric turbines on the Thames. </p> <p>The move does not represent an ideological departure; the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh are committed conservationists. But the timing suggests an eagerness to position the monarchy at the forefront of what is becoming a popular, global concern. </p> <p>The conference to be held in Berlin on Wednesday is chaired by Klaus Topfer, Germany's former environment minister who runs the UN's environment programme, Unep. The monarch's attendance at a reception for the conference, which is debating the sensitive international topic, is likely to send a strong message around the globe. </p> <p>During the visit, the Queen is also expected to join the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, at a forum for young people to voice their concerns about global warming and how best to combat it. </p> <p>Downing Street yesterday refused to confirm or deny reports that the Queen had urged Tony Blair to put pressure on George Bush to sign up to international treaties limiting the production of greenhouse gases. \"We have never divulged the details of private conversations between the Queen and the prime minister,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>The environmental group Friends of the Earth welcomed her involvement in climate change issues. \"She's helping to up the profile of this meeting in Berlin,\" said the organisation's executive director, Tony Juniper. \"That's very important in the run-up to the G8 summit.\" </p> <p>The installation of two hydro-electric turbines at Romney weir on the Thames is only the latest in a number of initiatives backed by the royal family. The energy-efficient project, expected to cost around \u00a3900,000, will be funded by Npower Renewables and could be in operation by next year. </p> <p><b>Green lines</b></p> <p>The Queen's green credentials include: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Both Bentleys acquired at the Royal Jubilee have been converted to run on eco-friendly fuel LPG - liquified petroleum gas </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Prince Philip's taxi also runs on LPG.

  "<p>The Americans, after their hammering by Europe in the Ryder Cup at Oakland Hills in September, are resorting to desperate mea- sures in trying to ensure the supremacy of their Tour. </p> <p>They are attempting to persuade - or bully, perhaps - the likes of Ernie Els, Retief Goosen and Adam Scott, who began their professional careers on the European Tour, to play more events in America as bait for sponsors and television audiences. It means big battles ahead for George O'Grady, who takes over from Ken Schofield as executive director of the European Tour at the beginning of next year.</p> <p>\"We are not happy about it,\" O'Grady said yesterday at the Volvo Masters, an event that was deprived of Els and Goosen, the No1 and No2 on the Volvo order of merit, when they opted to play in the Chrysler Championship in Florida instead.</p> <p>\"I think we are not very keen on somebody telling us that the European Tour is only the European Tour when we play in Europe, as opposed to co-sanctioned events elsewhere in the world,\" O'Grady added.</p> <p>\"That is the other point at issue. We are obviously very concerned but the very fact that Ernie has said that he's concerned should be concerning them. It seems like quite an extraordinary pressure to put on a player of his level who usually plays 17 or 18 tournaments in the United States anyway [the required minimum is 15 and the US Tour is now pushing for 20]. A lot of people debate whether we have the right minimum number, 11 tournaments.</p> <p>\"Well, they [Els and co] play an average of 16 with us on the global stage and Ernie is always prepared to listen if we need him to play somewhere but he's a very hard man to tell to do something. You do ask him, usually politely, and sometimes he says yes.\"</p> <p>It all smacks of desperation on the part of Tim Finchem, the US Tour commissioner who this spring will be renegotiating the lucrative television contract that underwrites his massive purses. With Tiger Woods on the wane - though surely not for long - and playing sparingly, Els, Goosen, the US Open champion, and Scott, who won the Players' Championship this season, are huge attractions.</p> <p>But Finchem must know that, traditionally, South Africans and Australians do not like being brow-beaten. Greg Norman had to fight Deane Beman, Finchem's predecessor, to ensure that the world was his oyster and Severiano Ballesteros and Bernhard Langer struggled to have Europe designated as their home circuit.</p> <p>O'Grady recalled: \"That was a fairly rigid encounter and we got that accepted.\"</p> <p>There will be full and frank discussions on the subject later this month when the US top brass arrive in Seville for the World Cup. More diplomacy and compassion will be required when it comes to Ballesteros, who is the subject of a Tour investigation into allegations that he assaulted Jose Maria Zamora, one of the Tour's tournament directors, at Pedrena, Ballesteros's home club, a few weeks ago. Zamora was in the bar when it is alleged Ballesteros stormed in, grabbed him and threatened to punch him, apparently still seething about being penalised for slow play in Madeira last year.</p> <p>\"The very code of professional golf is that the tournament-playing member of the European Tour must conduct himself at all times in a manner becoming a professional golfer,\" O'Grady said.</p> <p>\"At this stage we are not prepared to say what may or may not happen. We just find the situation very sad, if what is alleged to have happened is correct. We are very disappointed. Seve is arguably our greatest champion, our most charismatic champion, and, whatever the situation, it would be our hope it's handled very sympathetically. At the same time it's our duty to protect the normal standards of behaviour.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"So much for a long-ball team,\" quipped Joe Royle before settling down to discuss Ipswich's biggest win of the season, one which inched his team up to second place. \"I thought at times our football was outstanding and the scoreline flattered Preston.\" </p> <p>Royle was celebrating his second anniversary in charge at Portman Road, an appointment which was not to everyone's taste when he took over with the club 17th and where the fans had chanted against his prospective arrival in the previous week's defeat by Gillingham. </p> <p>Sections of the support remained deeply unimpressed with his methods less than 12 months ago and, although many seemed pretty muted on Saturday, it seems they are slowly warming to the man and a method that produces a shade under two goals a game. </p> <p>Royle, who has carried out root-and-branch reform on a 30-strong squad of well-paid players while steering the club through administration and adding only six free-transfer signings, was entitled to enjoy his moment on Saturday, annoyed as he had been by criticism of Ipswich's failure to hold a two-goal lead at Watford the previous week. </p> <p>\"I do read occasionally that we are a long-ball team, which makes me laugh,\" Royle said, \"but it's nice to see that we can still be progressive and we played some super stuff.\" </p> <p>Jason de Vos, the Canadian defender the club picked up from Wigan last summer, was keen to add his voice to the debate. \"Joe's been brilliant,\" he said. \"He wants us to get the ball down and pass it and no matter what your position on the pitch, that's all you really want to do as a player. We don't play for draws, we try to entertain out supporters.\" </p> <p>Royle has been this way before, of course, latterly when he hauled Manchester City through two divisions and into the Premiership and a few seasons earlier when he got Oldham into the top flight and left them there four years later. </p> <p>Preston, who have not scored at Portman Road since 1964, their FA Cup final year, spurned their best chance after 90 seconds, when Paul McKenna blazed over after being set up by Kevin Horlock's error. They moved the ball around pleasingly thereafter but Ipswich always had their measure. A replacement for David Healy needs to be found quickly. </p> <p>Ipswich were quick to settle and after Shefki Kuqi hit a post, the same player nudged Jim Magilton's through-ball past his marker - Preston's manager Billy Davies was adamant that the Finn handled it - and fired the ball inside the other post. Moments later Tommy Miller moved on to a pull-back from Darren Bent and the game, despite Ipswich's previous, was as good as over. </p> <p>Royle has been trying to find and field a forward pairing rather than a couple of go-it-alone strikers and he would have been delighted when Bent, who linked well with Kuqi throughout, lashed in the third from the edge of the area. </p> <p>\"I would hate to play against Shefki and Darren,\" De Vos added. \"Shefki is always a handful and Darren's got blistering pace and can create goals out of nothing - today's was something special. He's got a lot about him and he's a big asset for us.\" </p> <p>Pablo Counago came on near the end, with Bent dropping to midfield, but the \u00a317,000-a-week striker is the last remnant of the free-spending days and Royle would be delighted to ease the wage bill. His next bit of business is more likely to be be trying to fight off unwanted advances for Bent.</p>",
  "<p>Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain, Prince Turki Al Faisal, made an interesting speech last Thursday to a gathering at the London headquarters of Reuters news agency. </p> <p>The burden of his talk, entitled Perception and Reality - Saudi Arabia and the Media, was aimed at correcting the misconceptions caused by the British press blaming his country \"for any and every evil in the world\". </p> <p>He argued that the newspapers were guilty of painting a \"very black picture of Saudi Arabia\" which included condemning \"us for our lack of democracy, free speech and human rights\". </p> <p>Yet, he said, this portrait was spun from \"a web of dramatic and dangerous fiction\", listing examples of offending articles and naming three journalistic culprits: William Dalrymple of the Independent, Anatole Kaletsky of the Times and David Usborne of the Sunday Times. (I don't wish to make too much of a silly error, but the \"fiction\" requires correction: Dalrymple's piece was in the Guardian and Usborne's was in the Independent). </p> <p>Anyway, the trio are grown-ups and can defend themselves because I have bigger fish to fry in the prince's speech which concluded with a breathtaking statement: \"The kingdom has been rapidly moving towards the development of a more open media - on television, radio and in the printed press. Today the most vibrant discussions about the kingdom's future are in the Saudi press rather than in the international press ... Saudi Arabia is a long way from perfect, but we are working on it\". </p> <p>Far from perfect? By chance, two days before the prince spoke, the latest worldwide index of press freedom compiled by the French-based organisation, Reporters without Borders, was released. Of the 167 countries monitored, Saudi Arabia came 159th, behind Iran and Iraq and just above Burma and China, with North Korea at the bottom. </p> <p>In these countries, said the report, independent media either do not exist or journalists are persecuted and censored on a daily basis. Freedom of information and the safety of journalists cannot be guaranteed. </p> <p>So I turned then to a recent Index on Censorship report which lists a catalogue of what the prince might, on reflection, regard as imperfections in his country's commitment to \"open media\". </p> <p>I have room only for a couple of the many examples. In April 2002, a veteran reporter, Bob Arnot, was stopped from boarding a flight from Riyadh so that his laptop and video tapes could be confiscated after he had interviewed Saudi youths who expressed anti-American sentiments. </p> <p>Eight editors have been fired from their jobs in Saudi Arabia since 2002 by the minister of the interior, Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz-al-Saud, who has the power of \"approval\" over editors. </p> <p>One, Qinan al-Ghamdi of the paper al-Watan, was sacked for being too liberal. Another, Ahmed Mohammed Mahmoud of al-Madinah, was dismissed for allowing a columnist to criticise the demolition of a poor Jeddah suburb. A third went for publishing a poem critical of the Saudi criminal justice system. </p> <p>In June 2002, the TV station ANN TV was forced by the government to cancel a programme about political change in the Gulf region. </p> <p>All newspapers, TV and radio outlets in Saudi Arabia are subject to a web of royal decrees which inhibit press freedom. Offences include criticising the king, social policy and, of course, \"the sanctity of Islam\". </p> <p>A royal decree on the organisation of press institutions which came into force in February 2001 contains 32 articles specifying regulations covering every aspect of the newspaper industry without once mentioning press freedom. </p> <p>A flavour of its philosophy is revealed by the clause that begins: \"Publications should conform to the rules and objectives of government policy\". </p> <p>This constraint on the domestic press is echoed in the treatment of foreign journalists who have a difficult time reporting on Saudi Arabia. Yet Prince Turki had the gall to attack British \"columnists and commentators [who] sit in their ivory towers and pontificate ... without going within a thousand miles of the centre of the problem\". </p> <p>He added: \"Little time is given to investigation ... to work out what is going on behind\". </p> <p>But one newspaper which did dare to try to find out \"what is going on behind\", the European edition of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), discovered just how perilous it is to publish an investigative report on Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>In February 2002, the WSJ ran a story headlined \"Saudi officials monitor certain bank accounts\" which alleged that, in the wake of the 9/11 New York atrocity, the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority was looking into the accounts of a number of Saudi businesses on behalf of the United States administration \"in a bid to prevent them from being used wittingly or unwittingly for the funnelling of funds to terrorist organisations\". </p> <p>The WSJ's reporter, James Dorsey, had done a thorough job, having obtained five sources for his story. </p> <p>But, because of the culture of secrecy and fear that pervades Saudi Arabia, he was unable to name them. </p> <p>Among the named businesses was the Al Rajhi Banking &amp; Investment Corporation which sued the paper for libel. Before the case came to trial - and on the eve of an important related appeal hearing on a point of law - a settlement was reached two weeks ago, leading to the paper publishing a \"clarification\" and a letter from the Al Rajhi chief executive. </p> <p>Under the terms of that settlement the WSJ paid no damages, made no apology, nor was any order made prohibiting the paper from repeating the same allegations in future. </p> <p>Now that, Prince Turki, is a real example of freedom.</p> <p><strong>A compact with the readers</strong></p> <p>So it has come to pass. The Times will be fully tabloid, well compact, from today. The decision to consign the broadsheet to the dustbin of newspaper history came quicker than expected because of the sales success the compact has enjoyed in places where no Times broadsheet alternative was available, such as Ireland, Scotland and the west country. Evidently, public response has exceeded expectations at Rupert Murdoch's company, News International. </p> <p>Clearly, Murdoch and Times editor, Robert Thomson, do not think there is much risk of losing too many readers. They are counting on most of the possible deserters returning and, even if they do not, they believe that the extra readership attracted by the smaller format will more than make up for the losses.</p> <p>Once again Murdoch is letting the market decide. But he will also be delighted to make the switch: firstly, he has always wanted to do it; secondly, it will save him money.</p> <p>The really intriguing aspect of this change will be the effect on the other compact-only serious title, the Independent. Having led the revolution, is it about to lose out?</p> <p><strong>Come back, all is forgiven</strong></p> <p>I am very sad to see that the Daily Telegraph has dropped its weekly media coverage. It isn't a case of crocodile tears, pretending to lament the demise of a rival. I genuinely believe that dropping the section is bad for the future of British journalism.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss media sections as incestuous. But their positive aspect is the opportunity they provide to hold the rest of the media to account. If the public is to have any confidence in what we do then it is crucial that we police each other, helping to ensure that the power of the media is subjected to scrutiny.</p> <p>I am told that the Telegraph's decision stemmed from a squeeze on space and it was felt that music coverage was more reader-friendly than media reporting. That may be true, and it is also likely that there are newspaper owners and executives who dislike the tit-for-tat nature of media journalism.</p> <p>But ignoring the media at a time when they are assuming a global importance is a huge mistake. There is a public interest reason for maintaining a close eye on the media's ownership, content and ethics. So I hope the Telegraph bosses think again. Whatever their misgivings about the readers' likes and the dubious nature of some media gossip, they should relent. Come back, Minx, we not only miss you, we need you.</p>",
  "<p><strong> China: The future</strong> </p> <p> It's the fastest growing, most interesting, least bureaucratic place around. I'm talking about China and its system of state-directed capitalism. People in the US and UK don't really understand that China is the equivalent to four or five USAs, a place where, for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, they are investing $45bn in infrastructure. Combine China and India and you start off with a third of the world's population, already 2.3 billion. Asia is already half of the world's population and will be two thirds in 2014. </p> <p>The weight of the population argument drives you to say this is going to be the most important part of the world. It's back to the future because wealth is shifting from the West to the East, where it was thousands of years ago. Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, Russia and the [former Soviet] CIS countries are very much front and centre of our thinking. A lot of people say most of the people in China cannot really afford the goods and services that we are trying to sell. If you say that 150 million to 200 million people can, that is half to three quarters of an America. More importantly, in four to five years you will have very large numbers of people that will be able to afford our goods and services. </p> <p>I still don't believe people recognise the significance of it. In China, WPP is the brand leader, we have about a 15% market share. All our businesses are represented there in a leadership or close to leadership position. We have about 3,800 people in China. Our revenues in Greater China are about $250m. In China we have 13 joint ventures and we are the only company, apart from Hakuhodo, that has been able to buy directly into a Chinese agency, Shanghai Advertising Corporation. There have been a number of wins there recently of great significance that will become public shortly. </p> <p><strong> How do you win?</strong><br> </p> <p> There are only two ways that companies win in our current environment of low inflation and little pricing power, with concentrated distribution in powerful outlets such as Wal-Mart, Tesco and Carrefour. One is through innovation, investing in new product development. The other, once you have new innovations in place, is investing in branding and the differentiation behind them. </p> <p>iPod and Blackberry have been innovative and built branding and differentiation around those innovations. And the interesting thing about those two is that they were produced by companies much smaller than their competitors. When you think about it, iPod should never have been allowed to be produced by Apple. A Sony or a Samsung, an LG or a Philips should have done it. </p> <p>Similarly, the Blackberry device, which has become so popular, should not have been allowed to be developed by Research In Motion. IBM, Hewlett Packard and other technology companies should have leapt in on this. But because Apple and Rim took the risk, because they made the gamble, they have triumphed. I have had a Blackberry for three years - most people say too long, they get irritated with me. But the Blackberry is addictive. If there is ever one of those little envelopes unopened I feel I have to open it. I get about 150 emails on it a day and I make it a rule that I reply to every one. If any of those little red unopened envelopes are there I feel paranoid! </p> <p><strong> My media</strong><br> </p> <p> I find that I am reading periodicals less. The amount of time I devote to the Economist, BusinessWeek, Fortune and Investors Chronicle, which were the prime periodicals that I used to read, is much less now than it was three years ago. On the other hand, my consumption of specialist television, such as CNBC and Bloomberg, and special radio programmes such as Radio 4's Today programme, has grown. In addition, I consume more online. </p> <p>I read more of the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal than I used to because they focus more on feature articles. I read a lot of breakingviews.com and lex.com each day. I get my market close statistics from the Bloomberg television channel or Dow Jones which sends me an email at the close of play every day. </p> <p>It used to be that we wanted the news immediately and we could take time to analyse it. Now, if there are developments in China or India or amongst our clients, I like to see analytical comment on that much faster. It may be that I am an atypical media consumer. </p> <p><strong> The trouble with television</strong><br> </p> <p> I don't have any grandchildren yet but I'm sure that their consumption of electronic media and internet information is going to be much greater than mine or my children's. The trouble is that the people running media companies are 59-year olds, like me. They are not four-year-olds and I think it's very difficult for media owners and advertisers, given the speed of change in consumption habits, to respond. </p> <p>At home I have four televisions and two Sky boxes. I like to be able to consume TV in bed, in the living room, in the kitchen or in my study. I like to be able to consume TV whenever or wherever I like. I watch Jeremy Paxman and Newsnight before I nod off in the UK. </p> <p>The personal video recorder enables you to time shift, pause a live programme, or skip the ads if you want - but not at a visual recognition rate that prevents you from seeing them. I don't skip the ads. There's research to show that people in America stop off to watch beer ads because they enjoy them or automobile ads because they find them informative. </p> <p> Be that as it may, watching TV with a PVR is just another form of media consumption. I regard PVRs as an opportunity not a threat. I think they are good news because they will force advertising agencies to think about new and more creative ways of reaching the consumer using all the different types of television. It makes media planning and buying agencies more valuable to their clients. It's like investment management - the more media there are, the more complex the portfolio, the more difficult it is to distinguish what is good or what is bad. </p> <p><strong> Global domination</strong><br> </p> <p> When we were in the race to buy Grey Global, media comment was made about the conflict that would exist between Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, two rivals, both being serviced by WPP. But the conflict that supposedly existed between P&amp;G and Unilever existed already inside the Publicis Groupe. Publicis, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Leo Burnett have Procter business, indeed they have L'Or\u00e9al business as well and BBH, one of Publicis's agencies, has Unilever business. </p> <p>The media have failed to point out that those conflicts already existed. Investment banks, lawyers and auditors handle competing clients and they don't even have to set up a different operation, like we do, which is discrete, separately audited and separately located. </p> <p>Advertising agencies have long been regarded as an extension of showbusiness and therefore regarded as less serious, hence the need for genuine firewalls. I am a common point in WPP but I just float around purportedly on the top of it. Each of the businesses is run by separate individuals and by separate teams. I occasionally have contact with the major clients but that is to make sure that everything is moving in the right direction.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Martin Sorrell was talking to Stephen Brook</p>",
  "<p>I was teaching a class on Isaac Asimov recently and wanted to show a clip from the movie, I, Robot. It's not out on DVD yet. But a helpful student, whom I'll call Jonas (because that isn't his name), offered me a copy, pirated from the internet. </p> <p>The practice is widespread on American campuses. The actual downloading is both easy and difficult. Easy because it just means going to a peer-to-peer website, such as www.suprnova.org, and using its \"bit torrent\" program. Last time I looked there were 10 versions of I, Robot, between 700 and 5,000 megabytes, depending on quality. Someone, somewhere, has converted them into a format that can be run through a laptop to a TV monitor. Easy peasy. </p> <p>The difficult part is that you'll need a high-speed connection. Even so, it will take an hour or so for a low-grade \"theatre rip\" (ie a copy taken clandestinely in an auditorium) and twice as long for a copy lifted from a \"screening version\" of the film (pre-released for review, or to privileged insiders). </p> <p>The site carries a prim warning: \"You may not use this service to obtain or distribute software or any other copyrighted material that you do not have the right to. Any violators must leave this site immediately. This site is meant for educational purposes only.\" I can't see much educational purpose in a download of I Piss on Your Corpse, I Spit on Your Grave (a gore-flick on P2P offer from \"Sickboy\"). But some spoilsports might say the same of I, Robot. </p> <p>Student consciences are clear. \"They can afford it\" is a common justification. Why worry about expropriating a few dollars from an industry that gives Michael Ovitz a $140m (\u00a377m) payoff? The Robin Hood defence has, of course, never gone down well with the courts. </p> <p>More persuasive is the \"time is money\" line. Students, Jonas argues, apply a calculus. A DVD costs $22 (\u00a312) to buy and $4 to rent. But renting means two return trips which eat into out-of-class time. If you are paying, as many undergraduates do, $30K a year for your education, you budget hours as carefully as dollars. </p> <p>American students (unlike most adults) inhabit an environment that is continuously online. Downloading means simply hitting the keyboard then going off to do something useful. Like homework. </p> <p>A frequently heard justification is that downloading permits sampling before buying. It's a kind of test drive. It doesn't threaten the store-bought product: it advertises the \"raw\" movie to the discriminating consumer. </p> <p>The most sophisticated line of defence is that campus piracy drives technological progress. \"If it hadn't been for Napster,\" students ask, \"do you think we'd have iPod, or WalMart selling CDs for $10?\" </p> <p>Jonas argues that far from destroying the film industry, movie downloading has made it raise its game, exploit its visual advantages, and lower its prices. There are multiplex, mammoth-screen, stadium-seating cinemas going up in every city centre and mall. Tickets are about half what they are in the UK. Box-office is at record levels. Commercially legitimate DVDs come packaged with a whole range of peripherals: deleted scenes, interviews, background stuff. Blockbuster booms, as do myriad specialist outlets. </p> <p>Historically, cinema has always been propelled by outlawry. The reason Hollywood is where it is, rather than in New York, is because out in the far west, pioneer movie-makers were beyond the reach of Thomas Edison and his strangling motion-picture camera patents. In California the studios (like today's students) could violate the law with impunity. Had the industry remained in New York, we'd still be in the kinematograph era: law-abiding and backward. </p> <p>The authorities seem, tacitly, to agree with this analysis. The MPAA (which reckons piracy costs it $3.5bn a year) directs its wrath at bootleg factories in China. Campus downloaders get little attention. The local LAPD piracy squad has never raided Jonas's college. </p> <p>The college itself turns a blind(ish) eye to the practice. Students caught using the institutional server are reprimanded and required to read copyright law and take a quiz on the subject (Jonas is very knowledgeable). Fines or expulsion haven't happened, nor do they seem likely. </p> <p>A revolution is happening in the film industry. Behind every revolution lies crime. Until after the revolution, that is, when crime is redefined as the people's hammer blow for freedom. Forward with the student downloaders, say I. And thanks, Jonas, for the loan.</p>",
  "<p>Something odd - going on positively bizarre - happened at the London Film Festival last week. We stood and clapped a 49-year-old movie few of us had seen before, a magnificent blast from Hollywood past. And we cheered its star because she was simply great, a wise-cracking, song-belting, screen-dominating phenomenon: the great Betty Garrett, your missing link in emotion, hope and some shame to the dog days of George W and Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>The film (to get basic recommendations over first) was My Sister Eileen in its 1955 version; script by Blake Edwards, songs by Jule Styne, direction by Richard Quine. Garrett plays plain old Ruth and Janet Leigh plays drop-dead-gorgeous Eileen, two girls from Ohio come to eat the best of the big apple and repeatedly choking on its pipsqueaks. </p> <p>These Eileen stories, New Yorker specials, were nearly a quarter of a century and many stage and screen versions old by the time 1955 came around. Maybe that was a problem: one adaptation over a load. Maybe the cast - a young Jack Lemmon, a boyish Bob Fosse acting as well as dancing - didn't have its full pulling power yet. Maybe the blight, as we shall see, was deeper. </p> <p>At any rate, it broke no box-office records and promptly disappeared from view, rescued only now from ultimate disintegration by Columbia's film restorers. As good as new? Better than that. The cheers, not just at the London festival but wherever it plays, are utterly spontaneous. And the question you ask as the lights go up comes naturally: Who was that girl, that wonderful girl? </p> <p>Which is where the shadows start to lengthen. Betty Garrett was born in St Joseph, Missouri, 85 years ago. She was a big Broadway star in the 1940s and, like so many others, Hollywood recruited her. She had a clutch of big successes - Words and Music, Take Me Out To the Ball Game, On the Town - and was on a tremendous roll. And then nothing (or rather, something) happened. </p> <p>Garrett got married in 1944 to Larry Parks from Jolson Sings Again. He was blacklisted in the proto- McCarthyite purges; so, inevitably, was she. For six long, aching years - from On The Town to My Sister Eileen - the phone didn't ring; and, after Eileen, she might as well have left it off the hook. One more film in 1957 and then Garrett seemed a forgotten name buried deep down some memory hole. She and a broken Parks did theatre to pay their bills until he died in 1974. </p> <p>What a sad story, you think, what a grievous, tragic waste of talent. Except that it's not. The unsinkable Betty - 15 years on - re-emerged on prime-time television as a sitcom sensation. She won a Golden Globe for All in the Family (America's Alf Garnett clone). She made the biggest laughs from Laverne and Shirley her own. She joined the Hollywood hall of fame last year, at 84, and (the man from Columbia says) she's planning a new stage show even today. Janet Leigh, alas, may be lately dead. Sister Ruth is vibrant and kicking. </p> <p>So here, with all the verve of a true musical, is that missing link, a power too strong for nightmares. Ask yourself: what, looking back, was the blacklist but a panic attack over some phantom enemy within, a tremor of mindless terror over a handful of actors, writers and directors who might have posed some appalling threat to America - but didn't, of course? The blacklist, like the wider workings of McCarthyism, was hysteria and corruption and cowardice mixed with cynical self-promotion. It was a black mood at a black moment, a spasm that sentient Americans prefer to forget. </p> <p>But spasms, of their nature, pass. Americans - citizens of a country which, at its best, still invites awe and admiration - have a way of picking themselves up, dusting themselves down and starting all over again. </p> <p>Garrett, cheered in triumph after 49 years of forgetfulness, is an archetypal American success story. Against all odds. And that story, of course, adds a crucial chapter on Tuesday. Enter Osama, starring in another of his taunting videos. George W rasps on about his wretchedly amorphous, inevitably endless war, John Kerry tries to trump him on ferocity. Doubtless Bin Laden smirks in a cave somewhere. Can one rich Saudi and his loose, ragtag band of zealots really pull strings as the US votes? Is that what election 2004 is truly about? </p> <p>No one, to be sure, can put aside the fundamental litany, repeated constantly: on 9/11 \"everything changed\". That is true for the thousands who died in the twin towers, for their relatives and friends. It is true for politics in its preoccupations, for busted budgets and ruptured oil pipelines, for the civil liberties we used to take for granted. It makes fear the most potent campaign weapon. It swallows hope and peddles security as the modern snake oil from Abu Ghraib to Alabama. It may so far, we Lancet learn, have cost 100,000 Iraqi civilian lives. </p> <p>But, one fine day, shall we look back and say that this was just a blacker-than-blacklist, that things were done because the CIA (like Hoover's FBI) had lost its bearings, that politicians lacked the strength or wisdom to put these nightmares back in their boxes? That, for a time, we failed to tell the difference between thuggery, zealotry, atrocity and the global conflict of Tom Clancy's wilder imaginings? </p> <p>That has been the fundamental question since September 11. It is the fundamental question to weigh at the polls tomorrow. And there, up on screen hoofing her way into history, is a living reminder that the human spirit (which we may hope, yet again, is the spirit of America) has a way of winning through. What's Betty Garrett's favourite catch phrase? It couldn't be better. It's \"Just don't panic\". </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>"
