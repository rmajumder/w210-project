  "<p>European regulators were wrong to block plans by WorldCom to merge with its rival Sprint four years ago when the two American telecoms companies had already dropped plans for the deal. </p> <p>The ruling yesterday by a European court, while seemingly a pyrrhic victory, was welcomed by MCI, which was known as WorldCom until the business emerged from bankruptcy protection in April. </p> <p>MCI believes the ruling against the European commission will remove a dangerous precedent and that future deals in the technology sector will receive a fairer review. </p> <p>Stasia Kelly, MCI's general counsel, said: \"Four years ago, we argued that the global internet environment was rapidly changing and that no competitor could exercise sole market power. Time has proved those arguments true. </p> <p>\"While the companies elected to pursue separate strategies after the European commission's initial reaction in 2000, we believed a decision that so misperceived the highly competitive nature of the internet marketplace should not be allowed to affect future transactions in this highly dynamic industry.\" </p> <p>The European commission, which was ordered to pay MCI's costs by the European court of first instance, is considering appealing against the decision. A spokeswoman said the ruling could increase regulatory uncertainty, \"if from now on companies automatically withdraw their cases before a decision is taken\". She added: \"I don't think it's in the interests of the market.\" </p> <p>The case is the latest in a line of setbacks for the European commission. The court in Luxembourg has kicked out previous commission decisions banning the merger of the travel operator Airtours with First Choice, and the Swedish milk carton maker Tetra Laval's acquisition of its French rival Sidel. </p> <p>The WorldCom acquisition of Sprint was also blocked by the US justice department, which voiced concern about the strength of the merged business in the global market for internet connectivity. </p> <p>WorldCom collapsed later amid allegations of an $11bn (\u00a36bn) corporate fraud. The business became the world's largest corporate casualty and was forced to seek Chapter 11 protection from its creditors. Its former boss Bernie Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and is expected to stand trial in November. Separately, MCI is suing him for $300m.</p>",
  "After the debacle in Florida four years ago, former president Gerald Ford and I were asked to lead a blue-ribbon commission to recommend changes in the American electoral process. After months of concerted effort by a dedicated and bipartisan group of experts, we presented unanimous recommendations to the president and Congress. The government responded with the Help America Vote Act of October 2002. Unfortunately, however, many of the act's key provisions have not been implemented because of inadequate funding or political disputes. <p>The disturbing fact is that a repetition of the problems of 2000 now seems likely, even as many other nations are conducting elections that are internationally certified to be transparent, honest and fair. </p> <p>The Carter Centre has monitored more than 50 elections, all of them held under contentious, troubled or dangerous conditions. When I describe these activities, either in the US or in foreign forums, the almost inevitable questions are \"Why don't you observe the election in Florida?\" and \"How do you explain the serious problems with elections there?\" </p> <p>The answer to the first question is that we can monitor only about five elections each year, and meeting crucial needs in other nations is our top priority. (Our most recent ones were in Venezuela and Indonesia, and the next will be in Mozambique.) A partial answer to the other question is that some basic international requirements for a fair election are missing in Florida. </p> <p>The most significant of these are: </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> A non-partisan electoral commission or a trusted and non-partisan official who will be responsible for organising and conducting the electoral process before, during and after the actual voting takes place. Although rarely perfect in their objectivity, such top administrators are at least subject to public scrutiny and responsible for the integrity of their decisions. Florida voting officials have proved to be highly partisan, brazenly violating a basic need for an unbiased and universally trusted authority to manage all elements of the electoral process. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Uniformity in voting procedures, so that all citizens, regardless of their social or financial status, have equal assurance that their votes are cast in the same way and will be tabulated with equal accuracy. Modern technology is already in use that makes electronic voting possible, with accurate and almost immediate tabulation and with paper ballot printouts so all voters can have confidence in the integrity of the process. There is no reason these proven techniques, used overseas and in some US states, could not be used in Florida. </p> <p>It was obvious that in 2000 these basic standards were not met in Florida, and there are disturbing signs that once again, as we prepare for a presidential election, some of the state's leading officials hold strong political biases that prevent necessary reforms. </p> <p>Four years ago, the top election official, the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, was also the co-chair of the Bush-Cheney state campaign committee. The same strong bias has become evident in her successor, Glenda Hood, who was a highly partisan elector for George Bush in 2000. Several thousand ballots of African Americans were thrown out on technicalities in 2000, and a fumbling attempt has been made recently to disqualify 22,000 African Americans (likely Democrats), but only 61 Hispanics (likely Republicans), as alleged felons. </p> <p>The top election official has also played a leading role in qualifying Ralph Nader as a candidate, knowing that two-thirds of his votes in the previous election came at the expense of Al Gore. She ordered Nader's name be included on absentee ballots even before the state supreme court ruled on the controversial issue. </p> <p>Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, naturally a strong supporter of his brother, has taken no steps to correct these departures from principles of fair and equal treatment or to prevent them in the future. </p> <p>It is unconscionable to perpetuate fraudulent or biased electoral practices in any nation. It is especially objectionable among us Americans, who have prided ourselves on setting a global example for pure democracy. With reforms unlikely at this late stage of the election, perhaps the only recourse will be to focus maximum public scrutiny on the suspicious process in Florida. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Former US president Jimmy Carter is chairman of the Carter Centre in Atlanta <br> <i>\u00a9Washington Post</i></p>",
  "<p>World oil prices set record highs of almost $50 a barrel yesterday as fears of disruption to Nigerian supplies spooked an already tight market and threatened to have a knock-on effect at garage forecourts. </p> <p>The highest demand for oil in 25 years means global production is stretched to the limit, so news of fresh fighting between government troops and rebels in Nigeria's oil-rich Delta pushed up prices. </p> <p>US light crude futures rose 86 cents a barrel to $49.74, breaking the previous record of $49.40 set over a month ago. Brent crude surged 87 cents to a new high of $46.25. </p> <p>World stock markets fell on concern that rising oil prices could damage the global economy. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped below 10,000. </p> <p>\"Once again the security situation in Nigeria is proving to be a real concern,\" said Simon Wardell, oil analyst at World Markets Research Centre in London. \"We expect to see prices go through $50 a barrel as a consequence of this and hurricane Ivan, as some facilities [in the Gulf of Mexico] are still damaged.\" </p> <p>Rebels announced the beginning of a new offensive across Nigeria's entire southern delta region, and oil group Shell announced it was pulling some staff out of the impoverished area as a precaution. </p> <p>Nigeria pushed output to 2.5m barrels per day (bpd) of crude but had to cut that by 10% because of the strain on its ageing oil infrastructure. </p> <p>Oil prices fell back in late August as the Opec cartel increased production, but they have jumped in the past couple of weeks on supply disruption in the Gulf of Mexico caused by hurricane Ivan. News that Iraqi output had jumped to 2.5m bpd, its highest level since before the US-led invasion last year, did little to soothe the market. Dealers know the country's oil infrastructure is subject to almost daily attacks and supply is unreliable. </p> <p>Opec pumped 30.5m bpd this month, the highest level since 1979, but with most cartel members at maximum output, only Saudi Arabia has spare capacity. Demand from China, India and the US is easily absorbing the extra output. </p> <p>Separately, Reuters reported that the IMF had raised its forecast for world economic growth this year to 5% but trimmed next year's to 4.3% due to a slightly weaker outlook for the US and Chinese economies.</p>",
  "It is unlike Israel to be coy about getting rid of one of its most implacable foes, but that may be because the assassination of a leading member of the Palestinian group Hamas in Damascus was more brazen and potentially dangerous than many of its past strikes. Government officials in Jerusalem have refused to confirm that Israeli agents killed Izz el-Deen al-Sheikh Khalil in the Syrian capital on Sunday, but their nodding and winking is easy enough to interpret. Hamas, in any event, had no doubts, quickly and inevitably threatening blood-curdling retaliation. Since the organisation's speciality is dispatching suicide bombers to blow themselves up on Israeli buses, as it did - killing 16 - in Beersheba last month, it is not hard to guess what form its vengeance is likely to take, though impossible to know how many more innocent victims will die when it comes. <p>No one doubts Israel's ability to maintain its superiority over the Arabs, whether it is employing helicopter-launched missiles - as it did again to deadly effect against another Palestinian militant in Khan Yunis yesterday - or intelligence sophisticated enough to destroy cars in Damascus. Israel may also be assuming that President Bashar al-Assad is unlikely to respond because of pressure from the US over Iraq. But \"targeted killings\", this newspaper believes, are wrong in principle and invariably counter-productive in practice. \"Martyrs\" for the Palestinian cause are easily replaced by new volunteers who are motivated as much by the desperation of their own people as the ruthlessness of their enemy. Nervous Syrian spokesmen insisted that Mr Khalil was involved only in \"information activity\", though Palestinian sources revealed that he had headed the Hamas military wing abroad. </p> <p>Israel counters that in such cases it is acting in pre-emptive self-defence, and that there is no difference between targeting al-Qaida operatives or Hamas leaders like Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Rantisi, who were killed, to widespread international condemnation, in Gaza this spring. Israel clearly feels less isolated when its loyal US ally is waging an unfettered \"global war on terror\". But that does not mean there is a military solution to its conflict with the Palestinians. Critics of Ariel Sharon's government, including some Israelis, point out that just because something is possible, and can be done with impunity, it is not necessarily the right thing to do. Factor in the provocation and humiliation of state-sanctioned murder in the heart of an Arab capital and Mr Sharon looks not only reckless but shortsighted.</p>",
  "<p>RMC, the world's biggest supplier of ready-mixed concrete, has agreed a \u00a32.3bn takeover deal from Cemex of Mexico, raising fears of job cuts and quarry closures. </p> <p>The transaction took the City by surprise and boosted shares in the British firm 42% to 850p, only 5p lower than the cash offer price. </p> <p>It also boosted the stock market value of other potential targets in the building materials sector such as Hanson. </p> <p>The Cemex transaction is the biggest launched by a Mexican company and will create a third force in global cement making, behind Lafarge of France and Holcim of Switzerland. </p> <p>Hector Medina, executive vice-president of Cemex, refused to say whether the RMC management would be retained or whether there would be wider cutbacks. \"We can't rule out anything.\" </p> <p>Cemex is aiming for savings of $200m (\u00a3110m) annually by 2007 and a review of the British firm would need to be completed before the future shape and size was decided, he said. </p> <p>No one should expect any \"Mexicanisation\" of the business because his company had a \"very multicultural management team\". </p> <p>Cemex had been following RMC for some time and opened talks with directors two weeks ago. </p> <p>Mr Medina denied Cemex was overpaying but said it was a \"fair\" price for shareholders of RMC and its new owner. Cemex would need to borrow \"just a few dollars\" to fund the $5.8bn enterprise value of the deal. </p> <p>David Munro, RMC's chief executive, said shareholders were being offered the chance to cash in on the strong potential of the business. </p> <p>\"Becoming part of a powerful new group within the global heavy building materials industry will offer great scope and opportunities for our staff.\" </p> <p>Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein urged RMC shareholders to \"take the cash and run\". </p> <p>RMC, formerly known as Ready Mixed Concrete, was started by a Danish engineer, Kjeld Ammentorp, in 1930 with \u00a36,000 seed capital. </p> <p>It has been through a rough period owing to weakness in the German economy but was seen by the City as on the mend after a substantial restructuring which saw 5,000 jobs go. </p> <p>RMC, which gains 45% of its sales of cement and other building materials in Britain and Germany, follows Blue Circle into the control of a foreign firm. Blue Circle was bought by Lafarge in 2001 for just over \u00a33bn. </p> <p>The acquisition of RMC will increase Cemex's exposure to mainland Europe and raise Cemex's profile in downstream markets. </p> <p>RMC employs 28,000 staff in 22 countries including 6,500 in Britain at 300 concrete plants and 140 quarries. It produces 12m tonnes of cement a year and in 2003 had a turnover of \u00a34.9bn. </p> <p>Cemex, which owns one of Mexico's leading football clubs, employs 25,000 people in 30 countries and produced sales of $7.2bn last year but is more than twice as profitable as RMC. </p> <p>The biggest takeover deal launched by a Mexican firm in Britain before this was a $23m bid 10 years ago for Ionica Group, a privately owned telephone network. </p> <p>The largest previous transaction by a Mexican company anywhere was the $3.6bn takeover of a Coca-Cola bottling business. </p> <p>New York-listed Cemex made waves in the 1990s with a series of domestic takeovers that transformed it into a substantial international business. Four years ago it bought US cement maker Southdown for $2.8bn.</p>",
  "<p>Merino sheep are much heavier than they look. I only know this because I got up close and personal with one a few months ago. There were a lot of grunts and shoves but no telephone numbers were exchanged. </p> <p>It took all my strength to haul the dung-covered animal from the back of an old Land Rover up a flight of wooden steps and into a shed. It was especially tough because it was dark and my only source of light was the car headlights. </p> <p>This was not a stag party dare but sheep shearing time at an outback station in New South Wales - and far more fun than any blokey weekend I've been on. </p> <p>Shearing was one of my newly acquired skills at a five-day jackaroo school, where you learn about rural life and how to be a cowboy. It's an antipodean experience as far removed from beach and surf culture as you can imagine. Best of all, no one called you \"dude\" and there was not a celebrity in sight. </p> <p>It is not for half-hearted city slickers who want a quick snapshot of cowboy chic: this is fun but also gruelling, and you are going to get covered in dirt. No matter how many showers I had, I never removed the thin layer of dust that got everywhere. Jackaroos and jillaroos are Australia's equivalents to the cowboys and cowgirls of America's Wild West, and these schools are increasingly popular after Prince Harry trained to be a farm hand in Queensland last year as part of his gap year. </p> <p>I joined 25 young travellers much further south, at Australia's largest and longest running school for budding cowboys and girls in Leconfield, a 7,000-acre cattle ranch near Tamworth, Australia's country music capital, in New South Wales. The farm is located at the end of a 10-mile dirt track and is about as rural and isolated as you can get - a long way from all those sleek, glittery bars back in Sydney. </p> <p>My fellow trainees were mostly backpackers, Aussie, British, Dutch and German, and all, like me, city dwellers hellbent me on a week's crash course in rural matters - though one lady's ambition was to become a vet. The school can't promise to transform you into jackaroo overnight, but it does teach you the fundamentals of farm life. </p> <p>At the end of the week, you will feel rugged and invigorated, and it's likely you'll walk differently - though mostly because you are saddle-sore and exhausted. If you're used to luxury and sunning yourself by a pool or crave all-night drinking games in backpackers' hostels, this probably is not the break for you: there are washroom duties, washing-up rotas and accommodation is on the budget side of basic, on bunk beds in a corrugated iron shack. However, this rustic living just adds to the fun. If you can handle all that, you'll have a better time than the contestants on the new reality TV series The Farm, where celebrities swap the city for life on a working farm. </p> <p>My jackaroo school was a bit like a celebrity free version of that - Big Brother without the misguided egos. We were just average Joes and Joannas without any desire to be famous, just to learn a bit about the bush. </p> <p>It was early to bed and even earlier to rise. We were woken each morning at 6am with loud rock music - a similar tactic to the one used US Marines used to depose the Panamanian dictator General Noriega. </p> <p>We were immediately thrown in at the deep end of the realities of life on a cattle station, from mustering and shearing sheep to horseshoeing, whip-cracking, lassoing and mending fences; oh, yes, and improving pasture, which involves dousing huge swaths of deadly blackberry bushes with gasoline and letting go with a match - a pyromaniacs dream. </p> <p>While the jackaroo course is a practical introduction to country life, it is not all hard graft: we worked from 7.30am until 6.00pm but there was plenty of time to play up to the cowboy image. It was great to act the part in those leather chaps and Akubra hats. </p> <p>While mustering sheep on horseback, we traversed steep-sided hills and winding creeks to round them into a herd. I didn't really pull my weight on this because I was frequently distracted by the stunning surrounding vistas, with kangaroos bouncing across distant hillsides. The blazing winter sunshine was fierce and bleached a lot of the sprawling cattle station. </p> <p>We were taught natural horsemanship by our mentor, Tim Skerrett, whose family has owned Leconfield ranch since 1914. The school started in 1983 with the idea of training young Australians, but the majority of students nowadays are backpackers wanting an authentic experience of the Australian bush. Apparently I needed to learn to dominate my horse. \"Take charge - let them know who's boss,\" Tim said. \"The sneakier you are around horses, the more spooked they get.\" </p> <p>Until this moment my knowledge of equine matters had been limited to an annual flutter on the Grand National. But when it came to whip-cracking I finally found something I had a natural flair for. </p> <p>Outdoors all day, we certainly earned our dinner. We devoured huge meals cooked al fresco over a campfire. We were bushed, but not too tired to enjoy amazing sunsets.</p> <p>Afterwards, we remained huddled around the campfire, swapping stories from our respective countries and debating everything from the Iraq war to whether Vegemite was better than Marmite. I waited for a re-enactment of the flatulence scene from Blazing Saddles but it never came. The alternative was far better: above us were the clearest skies I had ever seen, a light show of shooting stars and satellites and a silence I had only dreamed of at home. </p> <p>A mixture of hard work and good fun, the jackaroo school does not shy away from the hard realities of farm life. For many students the most challenging part of the course was when we were invited to watch a sheep being slaughtered. This was optional and only a handful stayed to watch. I peeked through a gap in my fingers. </p> <p>Our teachers looked like Australia's Marlboro men, straight out of central casting: they looked like cowboys, spoke like cowboys; and even walked like cowboys. They were no-nonsense, grounded folk whose word was their bond. Rugged men such as Tim Skerrett and Steve Bokady had cowboys' names, big hands and firm handshakes, and looked like they had spent every day since they were infants doing manly activities outdoors. They were a great set of chaps, and good teachers.</p> <p>And their lifestyle was infectious. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to adopt the outback life. But just when I was getting on first-name terms with my favourite mount, it was time to leave. </p> <p>You vow to live off the land when you get home, though in your heart you know you won't get any further than repeats of The Good Life. But that's not the point, as the best travel is about creating hopes and dreams - even if they only last for a week. </p> <p>Back in south London I soon returned to the melee at Sainsbury's, but all is not lost: I'm definitely getting one of those great big bush hats.

  "<b>How do you feel about the Liberal Democrats in general? Are they a credible party of government? What are you hoping to see at the Labour and Conservative conferences?</b> <p>Despite the reported sense of confidence oozing from the Liberal Democrat conference it is still hard to see them as anything other than an opposition party. The idea of Charles Kennedy running the country seems particularly far fetched. His language is woolly and his demeanour lacks authority. Expressions like \"Isn't it disgraceful ...\", rather than a more forceful \"It is a disgrace ...\", give the impression that he is seeking reassurance all the time rather than leading from the front.</p> <p>On the question of policy, the general impression is that the party are happier tinkering around the edges than getting stuck into some serious decision making. The policy statements regarding the scrapping of tuition fees, providing free care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax raise more questions than answers. What is the point in implementing any of them if the net result is little different from the status quo? It seems like change for the sake of change.</p> <p>Having said that, there are two areas where I am particularly impressed with the current Lib Dem position.</p> <p>On Iraq, they are the only party to consistently question the government's direction and defend their own policy. With the situation in Iraq deteriorating daily and no clear direction from Bush or Blair, this issue alone might gain the party significant numbers of votes. A party which can be seen to be acting with integrity and honour on such a major issue would get my vote.</p> <p>The other area is the environment. Although the majority of what they say is the same old wishy-washy rhetoric, there are signs that they might be interested in taking the bull by the horns in some areas. An \"eat local\" policy aimed at cutting down food miles and improving the nation's health, as well as increased tax for unnecessary 4x4s and increased airport departure taxes to reflect the real cost of air travel are all difficult issues on which the Lib Dems seem to be taking a strong line.</p> <p>In conclusion, the Liberal Democrats are a party I want to like and wouldn't rule out voting for, but at the moment they are still too much in the middle ground, lacking a clear identity and strong leadership.</p> <p>The Labour and Conservative party conferences will hopefully be an opportunity for Tony Blair to be challenged on a number of policy areas, Iraq being one of the most significant. I would like to see a move away from the desperate rush to meaningless elections towards a more stable and secure Iraq which can get back on its feet before really significant elections can be held in the future. </p> <p>A far stronger line on environmental matters needs to be forthcoming from Tony Blair and I would hope for new policies to placing the onus to reduce CO2 emissions squarely on the shoulders of big business along with a range of sanctions to be applied to those who are not prepared to take responsibility for their actions. More funding for renewable energy and a clear rejection of nuclear power along with increased taxes on car use and petrol/diesel would also be welcome. We need strong leadership and aggressive policies in this area. Finally from Labour, I am hoping to see a wholehearted welcome for the euro and our full integration into the eurozone.</p> <p>I would be surprised to see any policies of consequence come out of the Conservative conference, but hopefully they might be able to play a role in putting Tony Blair under pressure in a number of areas.</p>",

We owe it to the people who suffer from [motor neurone disease] and are going to suffer from it in the future to try and develop treatments for them,\" Prof Wilmut said.</p> <p>His position was countered by the pressure group Life.</p> <p>\"We always have and always will be opposed to the creation of human life, human beings, which is what human embryos are, even when the claims are made that the research will treat difficult diseases and conditions,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\"There is quite a wide scientific opinion that research can be carried out on adult stem cells [...] For human embryos to be dissected and researched upon for any reason is wrong.\"</p> <p>Cloning to create copies of human babies is outlawed in Britain but so-called therapeutic cloning for medical research has been legal under strict guidelines since 2002.</p> <p>Prof Wilmut said cloning was necessary because the key cells in those who suffer from motor neurone disease are in the central nervous system and therefore cannot be analysed.</p> <p>The UN will discuss moves to ban reproductive and therapeutic cloning in October. The UK and others are lobbying for individual countries to be allowed to decide whether to allow therapeutic cloning but the US is a strong backer of an outright ban.</p> <p>\"I urge all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: no human life should ever be produced or destroyed for the benefit of another,\" the US president, George Bush said in a speech to the UN last week.</p> <p>Prof Wilmut believes the use of cloning procedures is not immoral.</p> <p>\"To be frightened of research with embryos and miss out on treatments would be a tragedy,\" he has said.</p>",
  "<p>Greenpeace has enlisted bestselling author Isabel Allende in the latest phase of its drive to urge British publishers to use paper from sustainable sources.</p> <p>Following the decision by Allende's Spanish publisher, Random House Mondadori, to print an edition of the Chilean author's latest novel, Forest of the Pygmies, on 100% recycled paper, Greenpeace is putting pressure on HarperCollins, Allende's UK publisher, to do the same.</p> <p>HarperCollins currently source virgin (non-recycled) wood pulp from ancient forests in Europe where, Greenpeace claims, logging endangers the survival of animals such as the European brown bear and flying squirrel. </p> <p>Greenpeace activists today delivered copies of Allende's book to the CEO of HarperCollins, Victoria Barnsley, calling on the company to follow the example of Random House Mondadori when they publish Forest of the Pygmies next year. </p> <p>\"It is great that my Spanish book is on an ancient forest friendly paper and that, by doing so, I am playing a part in protecting the world's ancient forests,\" said Allende. </p> <p> \"I would like all my other publishers to follow the example set by my Spanish publisher, and use ancient forest friendly papers for my books.\"</p> <p>HarperCollins senior management refused to speak to Greenpeace representatives this morning. Belinda Fletcher, the organisation's forest campaigner described their reaction as \"very disappointing. If Random House Mondadori can do it in Spain, there's no reason why HarperCollins can't in the UK.\"</p> <p>At the time of writing, HarperCollins were unavailable for comment. </p> <p>The Allende stunt is the latest step in Greenpeace's Save or Delete campaign which was launched last year with the backing of a number of high profile authors, including JK Rowling, Philip Pullman, Joanna Trollope, Helen Fielding and Ian Rankin. </p> <p>Greenpeace claims that paper derived from two of the world's threatened ancient forest areas, Finland and Canada, and from illegal logging in Russia, is being bought unwittingly by some of the largest UK publishers. </p> <p>The alternative to virgin pulp is what they term 'ancient forest friendly' paper - recycled paper with a high post-consumer waste content, or virgin pulp certified as sustainable by the Forest Stewardship Council. Under sustainable forestry practices, trees are selectively logged rather than clear-felled so that the wildlife is not destroyed. </p> <p>Canada is currently leading the way in the use of forest friendly paper. Following a Greenpeace initiative in the country three years ago, the major publishing houses, including Random House and Penguin, made a formal commitment to phase out the use of ancient forest fibres. </p> <p>Following pressure from JK Rowling, her Canadian co-publisher, Raincoast Books, printed the million copies of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix they published in Canada on post consumer recycled, chlorine-free paper, making it the only edition in the world to be totally forest friendly. </p> <p>In a message to Canadian readers, Rowling said: \"The forest at Hogwarts is home to magical creatures such as unicorns and centaurs. Because the Canadian editions are printed on ancient forest friendly paper, the Harry Potter books are helping to save magnificent forests in the muggle world, the home of magical animals such as orang-utans, wolves and bears.\"</p> <p>Rowling's UK publisher, Bloomsbury, has taken a smaller step by publishing the paperback edition of the book on part-recycled paper. </p> <p>In Holland, 14 Dutch publishers, representing three-quarters of the fiction market, have pledged to use forest friendly book papers. </p> <p>The main issue dissuading publishers from switching to recycled paper is the higher cost of such paper, due to the lower demand for forest friendly resources. Environmental campaigners argue that it is the immense buying power of the large trade houses such as Penguin, HarperCollins and Random House which sets the standard for the price of book paper, and that it would only take a critical mass of these publishers to switch to recycled paper for the price to drop. </p> <p>The benefits for the environment are clear. According to a study by American group Environmental Defense, each ton of 100% post-consumer recycled paper that replaces virgin pulp saves 24 trees, three tons of wood and 17m BTUs (British thermal units) of energy.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has taken full control of Sky Italia - more than a year after launching the satellite pay-TV platform.</p> <p>News Corporation paid \u00a360m for the 19.9% of Sky Italia it did not already own, taking it off Telecom Italia's hands.</p> <p>The deal simplifies the ownership structure at Sky Italia, a platform with more than 2.7m subscribers in Italy.</p> <p>Sky Italia was formed last year, when Mr Murdoch was allowed to buy pay-TV company Telepiu from Vivendi Universal and then merge it with his own service, Stream, which was co-owned by Telecom Italia.</p> <p>The merged group, 80.1%-owned by News Corp, began broadcasting as Sky Italia in July 2003.</p> <p>Sky Italia was launched soon after News Corp took over US pay-TV company DirecTV. Between them, the deals revived Mr Murdoch's ambitions of building a global satellite broadcasting network.</p> <p>News Corp's other worldwide businesses include its 35.4% stake in BSkyB in the UK and Ireland, and Star TV in Asia.</p> <p>Making pay-TV a success in Italy is complicated by the piracy that is widespread in the country, with more than 3m Italian homes able to access pay-TV services through illegally manufactured decoder cards.</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Virgin dropped out of the internet business today when it announced it was selling its 51% stake in internet service provider Virgin Net to cable giant NTL for an undisclosed sum.</p> <p>NTL takes full ownership of the venture, which the two companies launched in 1996, and will keep the Virgin Net name.</p>",
  "And now we have to go out and win the trust of the people to do it. <p> </p> <p>When people talk of trust, I say this: </p> <p>I know manifestos rarely make best sellers.</p> <p> </p> <p>But any party activist who wants an answer to the question about trust go and read what we said we would do in 1997 and 2001.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's a happy ending because rarely has a political party been able to deliver so much of what it promised. </p> <p>And if you can't be bothered with the whole manifesto, get out those pledge cards.</p> <p> </p> <p>1997, five pledges. All delivered.</p> <p> </p> <p>Except its not now 100,000 off the waiting lists, its 300,000 and it's not 250,000 young people off the dole but 500,000.</p> <p> </p> <p>2001, five pledges. All delivered.</p> <p> </p> <p>Except it isn't 10,000 teachers, it's almost 20,000 and not 20,000 nurses but 60,000. And the minimum wage is not \u00a34.50 but now \u00a34.85 and set to rise still further. </p> <p>So a new manifesto is being written. A new pledge card is being prepared for insertion into John Prescott's wallet. </p> <p>And then into the hands of everyone of us as we knock on doors, visit the factories, tour the shops, get out and campaign with some fire in our bellies, with some pride in what we have done. </p> <p> </p> <p>And of course, every change will be hard - change always is; every time we act on the reality of the future, people will accuse us of reneging on the values of the past.</p> <p> </p> <p>But on the issues we have just discussed - the normal run of politics, you feel, the country feels reasonably confident.</p> <p> </p> <p>The problem of trust isn't primarily that, is it?</p> <p> </p> <p>It is over the decisions I have taken, the judgements about our future security I have made since I stood here in this hall, about to address the TUC on September 11th three years ago.</p> <p> </p> <p>And since then, as with every other country and its leaders the world over, those with America, those against it, political life has been dominated in a way we never foresaw.</p> <p> </p> <p>There was talk before this Conference that I wanted to put aside discussion of Iraq. That was never my intention.</p> <p> </p> <p>I want to deal with it head on.</p> <p> </p> <p>The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong.</p> <p> </p> <p>I acknowledge that and accept it.</p> <p> </p> <p>I simply point out, such evidence was agreed by the whole international community, not least because Saddam had used such weapons against his own people and neighbouring countries.</p> <p> </p> <p>And the problem is I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam. The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power.</p> <p> </p> <p>But at the heart of this, is a belief that the basic judgment I have made since September 11th, including on Iraq, is wrong, that by our actions we have made matters worse not better. </p> <p> </p> <p>I know this issue has divided the country. I entirely understand why many disagree.</p> <p> </p> <p>I know, too, that as people see me struggling with it, they think he's stopped caring about us; or worse he's just pandering to George Bush and what's more in a cause that's irrelevant to us. </p> <p> </p> <p>It's been hard for you. Like the delegate who told me: \"I've defended you so well to everyone I've almost convinced myself.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Do I know I'm right?</p> <p> </p> <p>Judgements aren't the same as facts. Instinct is not science. I'm like any other human being as fallible and as capable of being wrong. </p> <p> </p> <p>I only know what I believe.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are two views of what is happening in the world today.</p> <p> </p> <p>One view is that there are isolated individuals, extremists, engaged in essentially isolated acts of terrorism. That what is happening is not qualitatively different from the terrorism we have always lived with.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you believe this, we carry on the same path as before 11 September. We try not to provoke them and hope in time they will wither.</p> <p> </p> <p>The other view is that this is a wholly new phenomenon, worldwide global terrorism based on a perversion of the true, peaceful and honourable faith of Islam; that's its roots are not superficial but deep, in the madrassehs of Pakistan, in the extreme forms of Wahabi doctrine in Saudi Arabia, in the former training camps of Al Qaida in Afghanistan; in the cauldron of Chechnya; in parts of the politics of most countries of the Middle East and many in Asia; in the extremist minority that now in every European city preach hatred of the West and our way of life. </p> <p> </p> <p>If you take this view, you believe September 11th changed the world; that Bali, Beslan, Madrid and scores of other atrocities that never make the news are part of the same threat and the only path to take is to confront this terrorism, remove it root and branch and at all costs stop them acquiring the weapons to kill on a massive scale because these terrorists would not hesitate to use them.</p> <p> </p> <p>Likewise take the first view, then when you see the terror brought to Iraq you say:</p> <p> </p> <p>there, we told you; look what you have stirred up; now stop provoking them.</p> <p> </p> <p>But if you take the second view, you don't believe the terrorists are in Iraq to liberate it. </p> <p> </p> <p>They're not protesting about the rights of women - what, the same people who stopped Afghan girls going to school, made women wear the Burka and beat them in the streets of Kabul, who now assassinate women just for daring to register to vote in Afghanistan's first ever democratic ballot, though 4m have done so?</p> <p> </p> <p>They are not provoked by our actions; but by our existence.</p> <p> </p> <p>They are in Iraq for the very reason we should be.</p> <p> </p> <p>They have chosen this battleground because they know success for us in Iraq is not success for America or Britain or even Iraq itself but for the values and way of life that democracy represents. </p> <p> </p> <p>They know that.</p> <p> </p> <p>That's why they are there.</p> <p> </p> <p>That is why we should be there and whatever disagreements we have had, should unite in our determination to stand by the Iraqi people until the job is done.</p> <p> </p> <p>And, of course, at first the consequence is more fighting.</p> <p> </p> <p>But Iraq was not a safe country before March 2003.</p> <p> </p> <p>Few had heard of the Taleban before September 11th 2001.</p> <p> </p> <p>Afghanistan was not a nation at peace.</p> <p> </p> <p>So it's not that I care more about foreign affairs than the state of our economy, NHS, schools or crime.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's simply that I believe democracy there means security here; and that if I don't care and act on this terrorist threat, then the day will come when all our good work on the issues that decide people's lives will be undone because the stability on which our economy, in an era of globalisation, depends, will vanish.</p> <p> </p> <p>I never expected this to happen on that bright dawn of 1 May 1997. I never anticipated spending time on working out how terrorists trained in a remote part of the Hindu Kush could end up present on British streets threatening our way of life. </p> <p> </p> <p>And the irony for me is that I, as a progressive politician, know that despite the opposition of so much of progressive politics to what I've done, the only lasting way to defeat this terrorism is through progressive politics. </p> <p> </p> <p>Salvation will not come solely from a gunship. </p> <p> </p> <p>Military action will be futile unless we address the conditions in which this terrorism breeds and the causes it preys upon.</p> <p> </p> <p>That is why it is worth staying the course to bring democracy Iraq and Afghanistan, because then people the world over will see that this is not and has never been some new war of religion; but the oldest struggle humankind knows, between liberty or oppression, tolerance or hate; between government by terror or by the rule of law.</p> <p> </p> <p>And let us demonstrate to Muslims here in Britain that these are values we apply to all our citizens, and change the law to make religious discrimination unlawful as we do with race, gender and disability.</p> <p> </p> <p>This party knows the depth of my commitment to the Middle East peace process and shares my frustration at the lack of progress.</p> <p> </p> <p>After November I will make its revival a personal priority.</p> <p>Two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in an enduring peace would do more to defeat this terrorism than bullets alone can ever do. </p> <p> </p> <p>Britain is now, committed for the first time in our history to the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent.</p> <p> </p> <p>Next year as President of the G8 along with action on climate change, we will try for consensus on a new plan for Africa, that not only on aid and trade but on conflict resolution, on fighting corruption, on the killer diseases Aids, malaria and TB, on education, water, infrastructure - a plan to lift that continent in hope and lift from ourselves the shame that so many human beings live and die in misery when we know together we could stop it; and when unchecked this misery some time, somewhere in the future will threaten us.</p> <p> </p> <p>But understand this reality. Little of it will happen except in alliance with the United States of America.</p> <p> </p> <p>And here am I, told by the pro-Europeans to give up on America and the Atlanticists to forget about Europe.</p> <p> </p> <p>And yet I know Britain must be at the centre of a Europe now 25 nations reunited after centuries of conflict the biggest economic market and most powerful political union in the world and I know that to retreat from its counsels would be utter self-defeating folly. And I know to cast out the transatlantic alliance would be disastrous for Britain. And I believe so strongly that if Europe and America could only put aside their differences and united around a common cause, the future could be different and better.</p> <p> </p> <p>So the decisions I've been called on to make are stark. </p> <p> </p> <p>When I hear people say \"I want the old Tony Blair back, the one who cares\". I tell you something.</p> <p> </p> <p>I don't think as a human being, as a family man, I've changed at all.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I have changed as a leader.</p> <p> </p> <p>I have come to realise that caring in politics isn't really about \"caring\". It's about doing what you think is right and sticking to it.</p> <p> </p> <p>So I do not minimise whatever differences some of you have with me over Iraq and the only healing can come from understanding that the decision, whether agreed with or not, was taken because I believe, genuinely, Britain's future security depends on it.</p> <p> </p> <p>There has been no third way, this time. Believe me, I've looked for it.</p> <p> </p> <p>But nor should we minimise the strength that unites this Labour Government and this Labour Party as we seek to win a third mandate for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is the lasting change we make to the lives of the British people that matters.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is the residents of Somers Town in Camden who told me how they are using the powers we have given them to fight back against the yobs who had made their lives a misery.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is the mothers I met at Dean Bank Sure Start in my own constituency delighted and proud that their children were getting so much better a start in life than they had.</p> <p> </p> <p>It was Natalie Barney I met in Nottingham, able to stay on at school and do A levels because of the Educational Maintenance Allowance - and last week Natalie started at Nottingham Trent University with 4 A levels to her name.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is talking to the decent hard working people of this country that gives me strength.</p> <p> </p> <p>And when I read out to you that long list of policies for the third term, I did so with absolute confidence that we will deliver them.</p> <p> </p> <p>Why? </p> <p> </p> <p>Because, whatever the events, unexpected as well as planned, along the way, on the central mission and purpose of our politics, on our plan to modernise our country, give a fair deal to everyone, build our economy on the talents of all, we are delivering as promised, and will deliver much more if we win that third term.</p> <p> </p> <p>It means having the courage of our convictions.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowing that it we are to make the NHS deliver what it was created to deliver, free, universal, decent health care for all, we have to modernise it to meet the demands of a new age.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowing that unless we offer more than the standard comprehensive, parents will desert our state schools and the whole of our society will suffer.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowing that we will not solve our transport problems by traditional methods of funding or our pensions challenge without altering the rest of our welfare state.</p> <p> </p> <p>And there are the easy bits and hard bits of leadership.</p> <p> </p> <p>There's no doubt which is preferable. But true leadership means doing both. Without the climb, you don't hit the peak.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we can reach it.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our ambition is to make the change in our country and in our world lasting, irreversible. In the last century brief periods of progressive governments were rapidly extinguished. In this century we must ensure that the progressive case once made is maintained, and the periods of conservatism are the punctuation marks not the sentences in which our history is written.</p> <p> </p> <p>For so long, we knew only the importance and futility of Opposition.</p> <p> </p> <p>But because we dared to change, we dared to dream that we could win again. And we did.</p> <p> </p> <p>And now we stand, in a position no Labour Party ever dared to dream of standing before, with a third term Labour Government beckoning.</p> <p> </p> <p>With the values for today and the ideas for tomorrow, and a policy programme that will change the country for better and for good.</p> <p> </p> <p>Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few.</p> <p> </p> <p>That was and is our mission and our purpose.</p> <p> </p> <p>I want us to win a third term not so that we can go in the history books.</p> <p> </p> <p>But so that we can consign Britain's failings to the history books.</p> <p> </p> <p>Build on the progress we have made.</p> <p>Give everyone the chance to make the most of themselves.</p> <p>Deliver better lives for working families.</p> <p> </p> <p>United in our values, </p> <p>Proud in our record,</p> <p>Optimistic about the future,</p> <p>With the courage of our convictions, we can win the third term</p> <p>Deliver the lasting change.</p> <p>It is worth the fight.</p> <p>Now let's get out and do it.</p>",
  "In late August and early September, as John Kerry's campaign for president hit one low point after another, bloggers of all stripes took to the web with pointed political advice for the candidate. They told him how he should attack Bush and how he should hone his message. They even wrote sample speeches for the candidate. <p>On September 13, for instance, Zackpunk, a regular contributor to the political junkie website <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos</a>, wrote in his \"diary\" - a kind of miniblog within the larger site - that while listening to Al Franken on the radio, two disparate facts about the Bush presidency fused together in his mind. One was the story, first reported by Bob Woodward, that when Bush told his secretary of state, Colin Powell, that he planned to invade Iraq, Powell warned the president that \"you'll own it all\". The other was Bush's campaign promotion of an \"ownership society.\" </p> <p>These two facts, Zackpunk said, left a \"huge opening for Kerry\", with an ideal speech from the senator looking something like this: \"Mr President, Colin Powell told you about this war that 'if you break it, you own it'. And now you're going around talking about an 'ownership society'. Well, Mr President, let me tell you what you own. A million jobs lost. You own that. A thousand soldiers lost. You own that. 1.4 million new people living below the poverty line. You own that. 1.2 million less people covered by health insurance. You own that. A 17% medicare increase. You own that. Health care costs skyrocketing. You own that. The tax burden increasing amongst the middle class. You own that. Mr President, if you want to talk about an ownership society, let's talk about what you own.\" </p> <p>The speech was a powerful, specific, fact-filled indictment of Bush. And on Daily Kos, when someone writes something as brilliant as that in a diary, other readers begin noticing, and if it's good enough the post can land on the Kos front page. That's what happened in this case, and Kerry's campaign seemed to notice. In a speech two days later, Kerry said, \"At that convention in New York the other week, President Bush talked about his ownership society. Well, Mr President, when it comes to your record, we agree - you own it.\" Kerry went on to enumerate Bush's mistakes and label his term the \"excuses presidency, never wrong, never responsible, never to blame\". </p> <p>It's possible that the Kerry people came upon their speech independently of Daily Kos, but Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, the site's owner, says that he suspects Kerry is listening. \"It's not that they're listening to Markos,\" he says. \"They're realizing that there's this huge community out there that has good ideas. There are 400 or 500 diary entries a day. If one in a thousand diary entries has something of value, that's a good idea every couple of days.\" </p> <p>Today, it seems that every online political junkie secretly - if not openly - believes he's James Carville, a strategist possessed of such uncontested political genius that a particular candidate would be crazy not to listen to his advice, especially if that particular candidate is John Kerry. It's possible to find people on the web who'll claim that they could do at least as good a job in winning political races as the veteran consultants on the inside. So what if these people have never worked in any actual campaign? At least some of them were warning, months ago, that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth would be a problem for Kerry and that he should respond hard and fast - an idea that Kerry's team would have been wise to consider. </p> <p>How is it possible that amateur political junkies are potentially having an effect on actual campaigns? The answer is that the internet has fundamentally changed politics as we know it. There is just so much out there that we didn't have access to four years ago: polling data, fundraising data, media-buy data; instant access to every TV ad and press release and unguarded gaffe and well-timed leak to jolt the campaign; insider dish on what the media's covering and what it's not covering and why; and perhaps most fun of all, there are massive online communities in which hundreds of thousands of people submit their mostly corny, often silly and sometimes unimaginably brilliant ideas for how this candidate or that should run his campaign. \"As a political junkie,\" says Moulitsas, \"this is heaven for me.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think that most people delude themselves into thinking they're actually James Carville,\" says Michael Cornfield, senior research consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/\">Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project</a>. \"But for many of them it's gratifying to pore over the poll data and all this other data and think about what you would have done. You know what I'd compare it to? It's like fantasy football. I don't mean to suggest that people are trivialising it, but politics does have these game-like aspects to it, and it can be gratifying in a number of ways to play the game.\" </p> <p>Jerome Armstrong, who runs the popular left-leaning blog, <a href=\"http://www.mydd.com/\">MyDD.com</a>, is 40 years old, and for much of his life he followed politics only \"on the periphery,\" he says. Only in the last few years has he come to see both the necessity and the excitement of civic participation, and in that short time he's taken to the game with all the gusto of a natural. </p> <p>Armstrong was an early fan of Howard Dean, and Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, was an early fan of Armstrong's blog; the match was eventually consummated in Burlington, Vermont, where, during Dean's rise and fall, Armstrong decamped to work for the campaign. Now Armstrong is a full-fledged political consultant. He and Moulitsas have set up a firm to advise politicians on how to use the web to outmanoeuvre their opponents, much as Armstrong (and many others) helped Dean to do in his campaign. </p> <p>Armstrong's interest in web campaigns is genuine, and given his background with Dean, he is just as qualified, if not more so, as any veteran consultant to advise a candidate looking for online expertise. But Armstrong has educated himself in much more than the mechanics of web campaigns. Like Moulitsas, he's a political polymath, the kind of guy who can recite every competitive House race this year, and if you've got time he may well tell you the various candidates' fundraising records, their support in the party, and recent polling data for their race. </p> <p>\"I've been looking at the House races for about the last three or four days,\" he said last week, launching into a detailed discussion of the Democratic party's chances of regaining control of the chamber in November. \"It looks really close. If the whole thing goes like 3% toward the Democrats, they could win like 20 seats.\" (That's just his top-line estimate. See here ... and here for a much, much more in-depth analysis.) </p> <p>Armstrong's House forecast is based on polling data he's culled from news sources all over the web, and fundraising data he got from the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">federal election commission (FEC)'s website</a>. \"What I've been doing is, I've been looking at where the Republican attack money is going,\" Armstrong says. \"Like I've been looking into how the Republican leadership PACs [political action committees] are distributing money, which House races they're targeting. That way you see which races are competitive.\" </p> <p>Four years ago, it may have been possible to collect this data, but it would have been more difficult than it is today, and, anyway, without the distribution platform of blogs, doing this kind of research would have been pointless then. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago you'd have to go down to the FEC and get their filings and put it all in a big book and bring it back,\" Armstrong notes. \"Maybe like 100 people in the country would have seen it. This year, here I am just a blogger getting this stuff, and since I've got the time and the resources I can look into this.\" </p> <p>Moulitsas concurs. On the web, it's springtime for number crunchers. \"I've always been a political junkie,\" he says. \"But never before like this. There's no way I could have kept up with a Senate race in South Dakota, or a House race in Nevada, it just was not possible. Now, every newspaper's online, and with <a href=\"http://news.google.com/news?q=federal+election+commission+&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn\">Google News</a> I can have all this stuff e-mailed to me when news happens. I've set up all sorts of keywords. I'm always getting all this stuff. It's a whole different environment.\" </p> <p>In the grand scheme of technological progress, increased access by bloggers to political information isn't the most astounding development. Glenn Reynolds, the University of Tennessee law professor who runs the popular, rightish blog <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com/\">Instapundit</a>, notes that \"if you look at a more general picture of the world recently, the difference between amateurs and professionals has vanished in a whole lot of ways. For instance, look at music - it used to be you only knew about studio stuff if you were a serious musician. The amateur would never know about it. But now you can set these things up at home. The insider tricks aren't insider tricks anymore, now that outsiders have access to the knowledge\". </p> <p>A similar thing has occurred in film and photography with the advent of digital imaging, or in journalism with the advent of the web and of blogs themselves. Why should political strategy be any different? </p> <p>The web's metamorphosis into a haven for armchair strategists seems all the more natural when you consider the fetishisation of political operatives that has increasingly become the obsession of all media covering modern elections. It's well established that there are not nearly as many stories about policy today as there are about campaigns and the personalities who people them. John Kerry's capacity to run a presidential campaign is deemed at least as important as his capacity to, you know, run the country. </p> <p>The success of the DA Pennebaker film The War Room, and K Street, and especially The West Wing - a TV show created by a political junkie as a gift to the rest of us afflicted with the bug - just underlines the point. One of the hottest video games in recent months has been <a href=\"http://www.politicalmachine.com/game.asp?c=1&amp;u=0\">The Political Machine</a>, which is no doubt the first game ever to feature as its primary villain the vexing mathematics of the electoral college. And finally, for proof that we are ever more concerned about the horse race rather than the issues of the presidential race, look no further than the talking heads on cable news, constantly plumbing the depths of a sole overarching political-strategy story line, \"What should candidate X do next?\" </p> <p>The amateurs playing politics online often come off smarter than those on TV, and you can interact with them, which makes playing the game fun. Because they are now actually involved in assisting political campaigns, it wouldn't be correct to include Moulitsas and Armstrong in this group of \"amateurs\". But they're definitely not professionals in the mould of the veteran experts advising either of the presidential campaigns or the political parties, and certainly their readers - who are apprised of much of the information that they collect - are amateurs. In this sense, what we're seeing in this election cycle is truly novel. Amateurs, the political junkies whose interest in politics used to go unfulfilled, now find themselves holding some of the mightiest data in politics, the kind of dish they used to drool over. </p> <p>It would be a bit too credulous to conclude that these developments will prove to be a boon to political campaigns and, more pressingly, to the quality of American politics. So far, bloggers and the readers of blogs have been most influential to campaigns through fundraising - especially for Dean, Kerry, Bush and many congressional candidates - and, in a few instances, they've affected the news cycle, most recently in their flogging of CBS News' now-discredited Bush National Guard memos. In the Dean campaign, Trippi and other advisers professed to rely on the readers of the official <a href=\"http://deancalltoaction.blogspot.com/\">Howard Dean blog</a> for at least some strategic advice. We'll never know if this advice ultimately helped Dean, propelling him to a position that he never would have attained without help from the bloggers, or whether, in the end, the cultish Dean movement drove people away from Dean and did in his candidacy. </p> <p>There is no easy way to measure the \"quality\" of the political strategy generated on the web in the comment section of sites like MyDD or DailyKos. \"It's all over the map,\" notes John Judis, the New Republic editor whose last book, The Emerging Democratic Majority, written with the political analyst Ruy Teixeira, serves as the basis for the popular blog <a href=\"http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/\">Donkey Rising</a>. \"It's just like in sports. Who's to say what's a good idea and what's not?\" </p> <p>But Judis also believes that much of the strategy offered up by denizens of lefty blogs is earnest, \"flowing from a genuine political commitment\", and is not out of the \"the sheer pursuit of consultancy as an abstract skill\". As such, he says, it wouldn't hurt political campaigns to monitor some of what's going on online. </p> <p>There is evidence that this is occurring, as witnessed by Zackpunk's ownership speech. But even if the blog audience does not serve up fresh strategic advice every day, it's at least useful to look at what the people online are saying if you're trying to attract them to your campaign, says Stirling Newberry, who blogs at the <a href=\"http://www.bopnews.com/\">Blogging of the President</a>. </p> <p>\"People are expert consumers, and it's much easier to find out what people really think about something like a consumer product if you observe them,\" Newberry says. If you go to a fan site devoted to motorcycles, you'll find out what's on the minds of potential motorcycle consumers. Likewise, if you go to a site devoted to politics, you'll find out what's bothering potential consumers of a political message - and you'll discover their problems even if their specific ideas or suggestions for improving that product aren't very astute. \"People really talk about the things they're worried about,\" Newberry says. \"A lot of people say that by watching these sites Kerry should have known that Swift Boats were going to be very important. He should have done something.\" </p> <p>One problem with amateurs holding the tools of professionals, though, is that they may not quite understand how to use them. During the past few weeks, there's been a spirited discussion between some bloggers over how to interpret and account for the volatility in some presidential campaign polls, especially a recent Gallup poll showing a huge Bush lead. Ruy Teixeira, the polling expert at Donkey Rising, has argued convincingly that the Gallup poll is off because it over-sampled Republicans in its calculation of voters \"likely\" to cast a ballot in November. Mickey Kaus, the resident blogger at <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/\">Slate</a>, called that thesis nonsense, and offered just as convincing a theory to support Gallup's numbers. </p> <p>Such a fight, let's note, was unlikely to have come up four years ago. Then, we didn't have as many polls with which to compare one single aberrant poll, and far fewer people were interested in the mechanics of polling. We've now got inside access to dozens of polls and sites that collect and analyse polls, from the indispensable <a href=\"http://electoral-vote.com/\">Electoral-Vote.com</a> to <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/\">PollingReport.com</a> to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/\">Real Clear Politics</a> to Donkey Rising. If you're an online politics junkie these days, you likely consume at least half a dozen new polls for breakfast each morning. </p> <p>But what's an amateur to do in the case of a real question about the proper way to use these new tools? Maybe there is a place online for real experts, people who specialise in such previously cloistered fields as opinion polling. Online, you sometimes see some very bitter, partisan fights over polls, with no small number of people charging that certain surveys are rigged. </p> <p>Looking over this world recently, Mark Blumenthal, a veteran Democratic political consultant and pollster, decided that his professional voice needed to be added to the mix. He didn't blame the amateurs for their occasional ignorance about polling. It's not their fault, he says, that his industry hasn't engaged with the people online. But now, he adds, it's time for that collaboration. \"My sense is there is a role for a source of information about polling. There's all this talk about manipulation, a conspiracy of the right or the left. Meanwhile, there's a community of social scientists who deeply care about how to draw a random sample, about getting things right. And the two groups aren't really talking to each other.\" </p> <p>The best way to get the two sides talking to each other, Blumenthal recognised, would be by starting a blog of his own to discuss the ins and outs of polls. That's what he did last week with a site he calls <a href=\"http://mysterypollster.typepad.com/main/\">Mystery Pollster</a>, and on his first day, Blumenthal got a link from Mickey Kaus and 15,000 page views.</p> <p>Blumenthal says he wants the site to serve as a bridge between the professional political consultants and the amateurs who populate the web, and judging by the comments people have left him so far, he says that may happen. \"It's an experiment,\" he says of the project. \"A six-week experiment, and then we'll see what happens. It sure does look like it's going to take up all my spare time until then.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p> <p>Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The German finance minister, Hans Eichel, today warned that global growth would be at risk if oil prices remained at their current levels.</p> <p>\"There will certainly be an effect on growth if such a high oil price is sustained,\" he said. \"We don't have a supply problem at the moment, but one of a relatively strong speculative element.\" </p> <p>Mr Eichel's comments - made a few days before Friday's G7 meeting of the world's seven leading industrialised countries - came as oil prices reached new highs after breaching the $50 (\u00a327.5) mark.</p> <p>US light crude, which has gone up 55% this year, this morning reached a high of $50.4, while Brent crude set a new peak at $46.8 a barrel before dropping back to $46.5, up 57 cents from yesterday. </p> <p>The impetus for the latest price rise came after Nigerian rebels warned companies to stop production in the Niger delta before they declared an all out war on October 1. The threat to supplies from Nigeria - the world's seventh largest oil exporter - comes with producers already at full stretch to meet the fastest growth in demand for 24 years. </p> <p>Companies working in the delta, the source of Nigeria's 2.3m barrels a day, have shrugged off the threat. Nigeria's top foreign producer, Shell - which had already reportedly cut production because of security concerns - said it saw no reason to stop producing. </p> <p>Italy's Agip, a unit of ENI, also said it did not plan to halt output. Nevertheless, concern over Nigeria's supplies has added to supply fears over Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia. </p> <p>The Opec oil cartel, which controls more than half of global crude exports, is producing around 30m barrels a day - production levels not seen since the late 70s. Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the Opec president, said the group was powerless to bring prices down. </p> <p>Opec raised production quotas with effect from November 1, but the move had little impact because it is already pumping well over official limits. While the group says it has 1.5m barrels a day of spare production capacity, the extra crude is not of the quality best suited to transport fuels. </p> <p>\"At the moment there's nothing we can do - Opec has spare capacity. However, whatever we do, there is no sensitivity in the market,\" Mr Purnomo, who is also Indonesia's oil minister, told Reuters. </p> <p>A series of hurricanes in the oil-producing Gulf of Mexico has accelerated the price, delaying shipments and disrupting offshore production and refinery operations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, news last week that US crude stocks had fallen for the last eight weeks and were running at a 13m barrel deficit compared with a year ago - at a time when they should be building ahead of winter - has also put prices under pressure.</p> <p>In real terms, stripping out inflation, oil prices are now near the levels they reached during the Arab oil embargo of 1973-4. However, they remain much lower than the record $80 annual average high reached following the 1979 Iranian revolution. </p> <p>The head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Claude Mandil, said the surge in oil prices was not justified by supply and demand, and there was no need for a release of emergency stocks.</p> <p>\"It is still the case ... supply is more than demand,\" Mr Mandil said. \"Of course there are some risks, and the market anticipates that these risks could occur, but as long as these risks do not occur I don't see why we would release the stocks.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Eichel, the EU energy commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, said the rise in oil prices was mainly due to speculation in the market and not a shortage of supply. </p> <p>\"I think that Opec, in the actual moment, has not a large margin of manoeuvre. I think they are trying really to keep their targets because there is a lack of credibility of the Opec in this moment,\" she said. \"It's not a problem of shortage in the market, it's a problem related with speculation.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was the year 2000, and Democrats were running on a record of peace and prosperity stewarded by the capable, if morally imperfect, Bill Clinton. It was a race that should have been won by their candidate, Al Gore. In fact, it was won by Al Gore, but the Rightwing Noise Machine kept it close enough to be stolen by the Republicans and their allies at the supreme court. </p> <p>What is the Rightwing Noise Machine? Conservatives in the United States have spent the last 30 years building a vast infrastructure designed to create ideas, distribute them, and sell them to the American public. It spans multiple think tanks and a well-oiled message machine that has a stranglehold on American discourse. From the <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com\">Weekly Standard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html\">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/us\">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Drudge Report</a> and Murdoch's <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com\">Fox News</a>, to (more recently) the mindless drones in the rightwing blogosphere, the right enjoys the ability to control entire news cycles, holding them hostage for entire elections.</p> <p>Gore learned this the hard way, as he faced a campaign of character assassination pushed by the right and abetted by a lazy-to-hostile press corps: Gore said he was the inspiration for Love Story. Gore invented the Internet. Gore exaggerated. Gore was boring. Of course, all of this criticism was flat-out wrong or grossly out of proportion to the alleged infraction, but it didn't matter: the media landscape offered no respite. In the US, talk radio was and remains a bastion of rightwing lunacy. Television coverage had become an extension of the Republican party, not just because of the influence of Fox News, but because conservatives had \"worked the refs\" so diligently that mainstream media outlets piled on their conservative \"pundits\" lest they be accused of \"liberal bias\". The political internet was dominated by the virulently rightwing <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/browse\">Free Republic</a> - still the largest political site to this day. </p> <p>There was no way for Gore to get out his message, or launch a counteroffensive. Given the circumstances, it was a wonder he won the race, even if our nation's Republican-dominated supreme court handed the keys to the White House to George Bush. </p> <p>The year 2000 was a wake-up call to many partisans like myself. Surveying the landscape, we could sense the flexing of the Rightwing Noise Machine's muscles, even if we were ignorant of its ultimate size and reach. We had witnessed the goring of Gore, yet sat by, helplessly unable to fight back. We saw the Democratic party get outmanoeuvred in Florida, legally and rhetorically. We looked around for a \"liberal media\", yet found nothing of the sort. </p> <p>It would be really sexy and dramatic to claim that a few brave blogger souls set out to build an alternative media structure, but that's not really true. We set out to write for ourselves, to provide an outlet for the angst we felt in a politically hostile environment - where criticising the president on domestic policy was somehow unpatriotic. And we weren't alone: there was a huge audience out there hungry for this content. And suddenly, the seeds of a liberal media blossomed online.</p> <p>And the blogs had company. While bloggers rode the Howard Dean campaign to greater prominence, more staid, institutional, and moneyed, liberals were also surveying the political landscape. They didn't like what they saw and they began to act. </p> <p>Liberal thinktanks sprung up to challenge their conservative counterparts. A new liberal talk radio network was launched. <a href=\"http://www.moveon.org/front\">MoveOn.org</a>, created to help Bill Clinton stave off impeachment, went from being a grassroots email list to a multimillion dollar media operation. Americans Coming Together will spend nearly $100m (\u00a355m) to register and turn out Democratic voters this November. Berkeley linguist George Lakoff founded the Rockridge Institute and is making waves in Democratic circles by showing how Republicans have hijacked the language (\"tax relief\", \"partial-birth abortion\", \"pro-life\"), and how Democrats can take it back.</p> <p>In 2000, Bush outspent Gore $193m to $132m. While Republicans still have a slight advantage in 2004, Democrats won't lose the White House because of money. But Republicans still control the White House, the Senate, the House, the supreme court and a majority of state governorships and legislatures, meaning they can control the agenda, while their Noise Machine can dominate the message and delivery of it. </p> <p>Liberal groups are fighting back, working to build a parallel infrastructure. My blog <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">DailyKos.com</a> receives 350-400,000 visits every day - double that of FoxNews.com and comparable to the Guardian's print run.

We don't have parity, but we're working on it. </p> <p>We all hope to have an impact in 2004, but there's reality: conservatives have spent 30 years building their infrastructure. We can't be expected to counter that in one year. We do things with an eye to the future, all the while doing our best to spare our country (and the world) four more years of a Bush administration.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Markos Moulitsas runs the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com\">dailykos.com</a> US political blog, and <a href=\"http://www.ourcongress.org/\">Our Congress</a>, a blog tracking the hottest congressional races</p>",
  "Tony Blair will today seek to bind up the personal and political wounds dividing Labour and join forces with Gordon Brown to unite their party behind a forward-looking manifesto for a third election win. <p>After 10 years of conference triumphs the prime minister will get to his feet at the Brighton conference centre, dogged by the renewed war in Iraq and growing public mistrust of his leadership, to make a speech that may save his career - or usher in its final phase.</p> <p>Party chiefs in Brighton last night breathed a collective sigh of relief after the chancellor's annual conference speech - which earned Mr Brown a three-and-a-half-minute standing ovation - was judged to be a unifying force and not the feared assault on Blairism.</p> <p>After Mr Brown placed economic success at the heart of an agenda to extend the welfare state into new areas of childcare and skills, Alan Milburn, Mr Blair's new policy champion, briefly upset the unity bandwagon by warning that Labour will not win by \"screaming louder and louder about our achievements in the past\".</p> <p>Mr Milburn's careless words at a conference fringe meeting won few friends last night. Mr Blair was preoccupied with polishing today's speech and trying to win the support of the \"big four\" union leaders - he met them at lunchtime - to oppose a timetable for British troop withdrawal during Thursday's Iraq debate.</p> <p>Yesterday was Mr Brown's day. In the fervently visionary language which marks his platform oratory he told delegates that they must unite to build a \"progressive consensus\". By combining the best of American enterprise and of European social cohesion New Labour (Mr Brown used the label) could make this country a beacon for the developing world.</p> <p>From the platform Mr Blair joined the applause and patted his colleague's back. Compared with the deep phase of ill-will which Mr Brown's \"Real Labour\" speech generated a year ago, the body language was positive.</p> <p>Blair aides were not briefing in advance of the prime minister's speech. But he will not apologise for seeing off Saddam Hussein, while admitting that he got the weapons of mass destruction issue wrong.</p> <p>Instead he will seek to focus attention on the domestic agenda where he and Mr Brown can agree on ambitious plans to extend childcare and help \"hard-working families\".</p> <p>As expected Mr Brown's speech made much of his successful stewardship of the economy and reminded an audience eager to be cheered up that even their favourite Labour government - Attlee's 1945-51 regime - fell amid economic failure and disunity. He appealed for optimism.</p> <p>\"When people ask whether in the face of this new global market in labour, capital and goods we can still ... hold fast to our vision of Britain, I say: in the face of these challenges, the future lies not in abandoning our vision of a Britain of opportunity for all but making it come alive for our time,\" Mr Brown said.</p> <p>\"Ours is a vision that works for Britain not in spite of our Labour values but, as I said last year, because of our Labour values,\" the chancellor declared. He was periodically interrupted by applause.</p> <p>There were passages which party factions could interpret as covert attacks on the Blairite desire to extend market-driven choice in the public services, notably when Mr Brown obliquely recalled the death of his infant daughter, and the birth of his son, John.</p> <p>The compassion and care he experienced represent \"values far beyond those of contracts, markets and exchange\", he said.</p> <p>As with much of the Brown-Blair text it could have simply been an attack on Michael Howard's NHS plans, not Alan Milburn's.</p> <p>Much more important to both camps were Mr Brown's tough words to the unions that a strong Brownite economy cannot tolerate inflationary pay deals, let alone renationalisation of the railways, as the conference looks set to confirm today.</p> <p>The chancellor also warned that people cannot expect \"security without change\" - an illusion no longer sustainable in a world where India and China are producing 4m graduates a year and pay their factory workers \u00a318 a week.</p> <p>\"There should be no change without security, but I tell you honestly, there can be no security without change,\" said Mr Brown, who argued that a democratic and open education system was a country's best protection.</p> <p>Mr Brown did not escape criticism. Tories and tax ex perts warned he would have to raise taxes, which he denied. But some union leaders praised the speech.</p> <p>Mr Milburn later dismissed the \"soap opera\" aspects of the Blair-Brown relationship, fuelled by what other ministers dismiss as \"the munchkins\" - acolytes in both camps who inflate what are undeniable tensions.</p> <p>For the second day running Mr Milburn endorsed Mr Brown's stress on the centrality of the economic message.</p> <p>But he provocatively added: \"In an atmosphere of greater cynicism and frankly more distrust, simply screaming louder and louder about our achievements in the past is not necessarily the way to get through to the public.\"</p>",
  "British contractors in the Basra area of Iraq are following the kidnapping of Kenneth Bigley with concern and sympathy, but have questioned the wisdom of living and working in Baghdad without security or personal protection. <p>Many who watched Mr Bigley's impassioned plea for mercy on oversized television screens last week say that it would not have happened to them. </p> <p>There are an estimated 1,500 contractors and civilian security officers working in the British-controlled southern area of Iraq. The camps have been built and are maintained by contractors. The communications infrastructure - such as internet services for soldiers - is operated by civilians. Then there are those that work in reconstruction: engineers, experts in sewerage, electricity and oil. </p> <p>Those who have no military experience hardly ever travel outside the camps of the military zone designated Multi-National Division (South East) without an escort. The majority are accompanied by soldiers in \"snatch wagons\" - armoured Land Rovers - providing cover with heavy machine guns and SA80 rifles. Ex-military types, armed to the teeth, also provide escorts. </p> <p>None of the contractors are allowed to talk to the media because of companies' policy that speaking about the situation on the ground puts their lives at risk. Some spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, others point-blank refused. </p> <p>Sitting in a rest area in Allenby Lines, one of the camps in the enormous, secure coalition compound known as the A Pod, around the old Basra airport, one contractor said: \"It's an unfortunate situation that chap's in, but I don't know the security measures he had in place. </p> <p>\"He took an unnecessary risk. We live on camp and travel with green fleet [the British army]. There's no ifs, buts and ands about it. It's company policy, we don't travel without the army. If the army say you don't move, you don't move. </p> <p>\"My personal feeling is, if they offered me another \u00a310m to travel unescorted, I wouldn't do it. What has happened to him wouldn't put me off what I am doing at the moment. Travelling unescorted is what would put me off.\" </p> <p>One close-protection worker said: \"Where we fall down as British people is the arrogance that 'we will be safe because we are British'. </p> <p>\"You are a contractor, you know nothing about security. You come to Iraq, you are badly briefed, you think it is secure because you are British. You go and live in Baghdad and you are a target. You have got a pistol and you think that will protect you; well it won't. </p> <p>\"They have really got to be thinking more about their security, they really have. These guys know you are on your own, that you have only got one pistol. They know you have got no security. The Iraqi people might be poor but they are not stupid. </p> <p>\"What British contractors have got to do is make sure their security is 100%. They have got to have a company looking after them 24/7. </p> <p>\"This man has been too blatant. He has gone, 'Hey, I am British, they won't hurt me.' But he was a soft target.\" </p> <p>For almost all of his six-month contract with Gulf Supplies and Commercial services, a United Arab Emirates-based general services and construction contractor, Mr Bigley had lived in a house in the affluent Mansur area of Baghdad outside the high-security area known as the Green Zone. </p> <p>He travelled around in a distinctive 4x4 vehicle and chose to have no security guards of his own. His limited hostile-environment training came from his brother, who had also spent many years living in the Middle East. When asked by a neighbour why he had no protection in place, he is reported to have said: \"I'm not afraid. You only die once.\" </p> <p>In its latest report, Centurion, a company that provides training for those travelling and working in danger zones, says of the situation in Iraq: \"Safety for any foreigner in Iraq cannot be guaranteed 100%, with or without security guards ... the majority of foreign workers in Iraq can leave at any time and should not feel forced to work in the country. Most foreign workers in Iraq are attracted by good salaries, a fact which has to be weighed against the good, safe life you could have back home without the fear of kidnapping, injury or death. </p> <p>\"It's their personal decision to work in this dangerous environment _ Training in all aspects regarding these issues should be compulsory. Cost should not be an issue.\" </p> <p><b> Negligent</b><br> </p> <p> Another security guard said companies without the highest security in place were negligent and culpable. </p> <p>\"If it's a Middle Eastern company he was working for, you can forget it; they just don't take security seriously enough. Whether he wanted to live in a house unprotected or not, he shouldn't have been allowed. It is his employer's responsibility to look after his safety as well as his own. It is unbelievably naive,\" he said. </p> <p>But even those with such protection are vulnerable. Last week, a party escorted by a team from Hart Security was attacked while travelling in the British-controlled Amara area. </p> <p>The non-military 4x4 vehicle - known as white fleet - was shot at, with one of the bullets going through the window, hitting the passenger in the head and causing a bloody but superficial injury. </p> <p>As the days go by without news of Mr Bigley, contractors talk of going home not because of his predicament, but simply because the life they lead is tough, hot and mostly boring. They admit, though, that the thought of kidnap isn't too far from their minds, since it is always a consideration of the British soldier that they so heavily rely on for protection. </p> <p>As one private said: \"We have so many things to think about - shooting, improvised explosive devices, mortars, rockets - but we also have to have the idea that we might be taken hostage, and we are always on the lookout for the possibility. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day, everyone here is taking a risk. It's just that the contractors get paid an awful lot of money to do it.\" </p>",
  "Earlier this year, 15 foetuses were found dumped in a river in Nairobi, Kenya. A night watchman reportedly spotted men unloading black plastic bags from a vehicle into the Ngong river. His discovery sparked a public outcry and helped to reinforce opposition against abortion in the east African country: especially when it was discovered that at least one of the bags contained a foetus that was almost full-term. <p>Kenyan health minister Charity Ngilu says abortion will never be used as a solution to unwanted pregnancy, while the police quickly launched investigations to track down the mothers and offending doctors. Abortion in Kenya is illegal, except if there is a severe threat to the physical and mental health of the mother. It carries a penalty of 14 years in prison for the abortionist and seven for the mother. </p> <p>Despite this harsh law, about 300,000 abortions are carried out every year in Kenya. Many of these are done secretly with a range of instruments including dirty sticks and pieces of metal wire, or by using toxic chemicals and violent massage. These crude interventions cause miscarriage, excessive bleeding, ulceration, infection and, at times, irreparable damage to the woman's health. It is estimated that at least 2,500 women die annually from botched terminations. Statistics also suggest that many Kenyan women would like to use contraceptives but are unable to access them. The situation has been tragically compounded by the US policy on foreign funding - formally called the Mexico City Policy, but dubbed the global gag rule. </p> <p>'The rule was ill advised and its impact is wider than has really been quantified. What I can say for sure is that it's like passing a death sentence on a number of women who otherwise would have been saved,' says Dr Solomon Orero, one of Kenya's most authoritative gynaecologists. He specialises in post-abortion care, harnessing foreign and local funding to develop facilities - particularly in remote, under-serviced areas - for women to receive lifesaving medical care after unsafe abortions. </p> <p>Orero argues that a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy must be seen in the context of the life she lives. Most Kenyans are poor by western standards and it is a struggle for them to access basic healthcare. Despite a government commitment to family planning, the use of contraception has stagnated in Kenya at 1998 levels, with the average mother bearing five children. </p> <p>'Here is a woman who is illiterate most of the time, who is ignorant most of the time, who has no rights most of the time, who has no opinion most the time,' says Orero. 'What then happens is that woman, who is poor most of the time, will be powerless to do anything about the complications from an unwanted pregnancy.' </p> <p>This category of woman, Orero says, has become a victim of US anti-abortion foreign policy. They are often dependent on family planning organisations, places that have lost funding for refusing to sign the global gag rule. The politics of the richest nation are arbitrarily affecting the lives of those on the poorest continent. </p> <p>Kenya's most prominent family-planning NGO, the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK), for example, is poised to close half of its clinics this year. It has already closed three. If it cannot find more funds, only four will remain by December. 'It has been disastrous for us,' says executive director Godwin Mzenge. 'When the global gag rule took effect, USAID was funding five out of 14 clinics as well as community-based activities and volunteers.' </p> <p>Previously, USAID funding provided training, personnel costs, clinic supplies and overheads. It even helped to fund the purchase of the FPAK head office building. Similarly, Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK), which provides half of all family planning in Kenya, has lost resources. </p> <p>'In this country, 60% of the population are young people moving into their reproductive age,' says Cyprian Awiti, programme director of MSK. 'There is a strong need for reproductive health, family planning, the management of sexually transmitted disease, HIV/Aids treatment and safe motherhood.' </p> <p>As a little boy, Awiti witnessed his mother preparing to give birth to his sister 'between stones' near his village in rural west Kenya. It was the traditional way to give birth. 'When my mother was about to go into labour, she walked out of the house and there were two stones,' he says. 'She supported her back with one stone, and with her legs on the other, she pushed out the child.' </p> <p>In Awiti's lifetime, Kenya has undergone limited modernisation, particularly in urban areas, but the government is still battling to provide health services. From the private sector, Awiti has worked hard to develop a network of Marie Stopes clinics and community programmes to give women like his mother better access to reproductive health services. Now he's up against the global gag rule. </p> <p>'We have lost about 30% of our services as a result,' Awiti says. 'We are not able to reach as many women in the rural areas as we had planned with the funding from the US. We had to close two facilities that were very dear to us.' </p> <p>One of the former Marie Stopes clinics now stands boarded up in a dirty alley in Mathare, Nairobi. Groups of unsupervised children play and scamper nearby in mounds of litter. A 15-year-old among them has a baby tied to her back. </p> <p>'If this clinic was open, she wouldn't have become pregnant,' says Rose Cheche, a volunteer who used to work from the clinic in this community. 'Since it closed, the people have not been happy. Patients who are pregnant have nowhere to go. The place where you can buy the pill is far from here and the transport costs are high.' </p> <p>Josephine Musyoka, a mother of seven, used to go to an FPAK clinic in the slum of Eastleigh. 'Ever since the clinic closed, I have found it difficult to pay for family planning. The transport costs to the government clinic are high. I have also noticed that prices have increased at the new facility, and, as I don't work, I can't afford them,' she says. </p> <p>Musyoka is softly spoken and a little shy. She says that she and her friends do not like going to the government clinic as the officials are insensitive and do not spend time on consultations. But city dwellers like Musyoka are better off than their rural sisters. Such women now have to travel up to 50km from their homes to acquire contraceptives, according to Mzenge. Roads are treacherous and long trips are expensive. Previously, community volunteers formed a network through urban and rural Kenya providing both contraceptives and counselling. Without NGO resources, many are no longer serving women's needs. </p> <p>'The woman loses more than just a packet of pills. In fact, I would say that a packet of pills is an entry point to giving the woman health education on issues of nutrition, breast-feeding, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids,' Mzenge says. He adds that many Kenyans are now interpreting the cutbacks as a sign that family planning is no longer a priority. To start them up again at a later stage would be difficult due to scepticism from disappointed clients. </p> <p>The despair in Kenya is matched by concerns felt by similar organisations in Africa's second most populous country: Ethiopia. Of all Africans, Ethiopians use contraception the least. Ethiopia's health service reaches only half of its people. As in Kenya, abortion is illegal, and the maternal mortality rate is alarmingly high at 871 deaths for every 100,000 births. </p> <p>'According to some studies, 54% of these deaths are the result of unsafe abortion,' says Getachew Bekele, programme director of Marie Stopes International Ethiopia (MSIE). </p> <p>MSIE has had to reduce its community-based programmes and has already closed down three health posts that distributed contraceptives to communities. As in Kenya, many people now have to travel long distances for these services. </p> <p>'When we were told to sign the agreement of the Mexico City Policy, it was not an easy decision,' says Amare Bedada, executive director of the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE), the country's largest family planning organisation. 'It was a big dilemma for us. 'The FGAE is committed to advocating safe abortion and felt it could not betray its principles. 'In addition to this, we are working with youth and we cannot refuse counselling or be unsympathetic to somebody with a problem.' </p> <p>As a consequence of its decision, USAID withdrew support for the FGAE, which then lost almost 35% of its external funds. The FGAE built up its services and networks over four decades, but was suddenly forced to cancel numerous outreach programmes, reduce the number of volunteers from 1,000 to 90 and cut its staff. </p> <p>Ude is one of the small rural villages losing out as a result of the funding crisis. It is a two-hour drive south of the capital, Addis Ababa. Most people in Ude travel on foot or by donkey cart. Defaru Jima, a local farmer, is the volunteer responsible for contraception in the village. FGAE gave him a multicoloured bicycle on which to do his rounds to distribute pills and information. His health post is a mudwalled hut that is almost completely bare save for some faded posters offering graphic warnings against unsafe abortion, advice to new mothers and displaying contraceptive pill samples. Jima says he opens the post twice a week, but he looks dispirited. His stipend has been cut and there have been no refresher courses. </p> <p>'One of the CBD nurses has been laid off, and I have not received my uniform, which is important for my identity as a volunteer,' Jima says. He has complained to the nearest FGAE branch in Nazareth, a bustling commercial centre. Mohammed Yimer, the head of planning at the clinic, is trying to stretch his reduced budget to meet the needs of the community. Five senior members of staff have been retrenched, including the laboratory technician and a senior nurse. </p> <p> 'The funding was substantially withdrawn due to the global gag rule. We are in a serious and critical period,' Yimer explains. 'Almost 20% of our budget was from that source. We have been forced to reduce our staff. People don't believe us any more. They were expecting us - requesting us - to expand the services to create more access for other rural areas, but, instead, we have stopped some activities, training for volunteers and the provision of uniforms and other supplies. The overall programme was totally paralysed for a time.' </p> <p> As Yimer leaves for a field visit, he shows us a waiting room filled with young women, many of whom are pregnant. The rape and abduction of young girls is common in Ethiopia. Unmarried pregnant girls are disowned by their communities, such is the shame, and forced into domestic work or prostitution. Traditional attitudes to women can be inflexible. Many families practise female genital mutilation as a rite of passage for young girls. </p> <p> It is estimated that 36% of married Ethiopian women cannot obtain contraceptives when they want them. The NGO community promotes reproductive rights for women, but it has yet to overcome resistance from traditional and religious leaders within this comparatively conservative society. The legalisation of abortion is one of the most contested issues in Ethiopia. </p> <p> 'The gag rule is having a chilling effect on this heated debate,' says Bedada. 'People cite the example of the US policy and raise the question that if the US - a country that has extensive experience in making abortion legal - recoils, it is certain that many people will consider abortion inappropriate.' </p> <p> 'The latest policy of the US has stopped some of the most innovative programmes in this country,' says Sahlu Haile, the senior programme adviser of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. 'It takes several years or decades to develop reproductive health programmes, but only a single day to destroy them.' </p> <p> The foundation stepped in to temper some of the losses of affected organisations. However, Haile estimates that the funds provided by donors fall short of the $100m a year Ethiopia needs for family planning. He worries about the shortages of contraceptive supplies. </p> <p> 'It's a serious problem, because if the family planning organisation runs out of contraceptives for three months, it is dead. There are no alternatives for a rural woman: if she does not get contraception, she'll become pregnant. It is criminal to start something you can't continue.' </p> <p> Many African governments rely heavily on international donors to provide family planning commodities: stocks of contraceptive pills, injections and condoms. Recently, supplies have been erratic, leading to sporadic shortages, which has demoralised family planning organisations. Haile is critical of the Ethiopian government for its half-hearted commitment in delivering contraception and for not resolving the population crisis, which he says worsens poverty. </p> <p> The head of the Ethiopian National Population Office, Hiruy Mitiku, blames 'petty operational problems' for the breakdown in the distribution of contraceptives. He says the government has failed to create an effective healthcare system. Ethiopia has set challenging goals for itself: reducing the maternal mortality rate by half by 2015, and bringing down the fertility rate so the average Ethiopian woman has four children instead of eight. But these targets are unlikely to be met. </p> <p> 'The rapid population growth is eating up our development efforts in this country and frustrating the whole thing,' Mitiku says. He agrees that the re-instatement of the Mexico City policy was a blow to the government. 'It has affected us quite a lot. The NGOs were trying to penetrate deep into the rural areas and support our service,' he says. </p> <p> The family planning associations have also been hit by an unexpected problem. The focus on HIV/Aids has meant that international funding is diverted to what is perceived as a more urgent global crisis, and they say reproductive health is taking a back seat. Internationally and domestically, there is insufficient political will and money to make up the shortfall. </p> <p> 'Our government is always broke, so we could not turn to it and say, \"Could you extend a helping hand here?\"' says Mzenge. </p> <p> The head of the Kenyan Population Services, Doctor Richard Muga, admits there is not enough money to meet the reproductive health needs of Kenyan women. But he is loath to say who is to blame. </p> <p> 'When these resources don't come, it is a nightmare for the people of Kenya, 'Muga says. 'A message should go out there that sub-Saharan Africa - Kenya included - still needs this support. So out there, anybody who cares, they need to hear.'</p>",

  "To say that Giorgio Armani makes nice jackets is a little like saying Helen of Troy was quite pretty. Armani's jackets are legendary, with a status that transcends the vagaries of trends. <p>Since the early 80s, the Armani jacket - in grey or taupe, with its signature shrugged-on silhouette, and sleeves that cry out to be pushed up to the elbow - has been a symbol of both taste and power. No wonder Hollywood stars and executives love them so. </p> <p>Armani recently told American Vogue: \"I spend a lot of time worrying about how a jacket fits.\" And on the evidence of yesterday's Emporio Armani catwalk collection, a showcase for one of Armani's less expensive lines and the first big show of Milan fashion week, the worrying is still paying off. </p> <p>The jacket shape has moved on from the easy, mannish lines made famous by Jodie Foster, Michelle Pfeiffer and many others on the red carpet; now the preferred shape is slim and neat, with high armholes and a well-defined waist. In wafer-thin leather or crumpled silk, single or double-breasted, there was a jacket for everyone. </p> <p>The key silhouette - a slim, short jacket over a long, loose blouse or shirt, with trousers beneath tapering to the ankle - was, Armani said, inspired by contemporary India. Nehru collars, always an Armani favourite, were crisp and summery in white. But some of the looks were more colonial in feel - models in white polo trousers carrying croquet mallets, for example. </p> <p>In fashion, six months is a long time. So to survive for almost 30 years, as Armani's company has done, is quite an achievement. And Armani, now 70, has the luxury of still owning his own name and company - one which turned over nearly $5bn last year. In recent years, Armani's catwalk collections have not always been universally adored by the fashion press, but the catwalk is now an important but ultimately small element of the Armani global empire. </p> <p>Just as much publicity, if not more, is generated by dressing celebrities. Armani, never one to miss a marketing opportunity, is using this fashion week to promote his celebrity associations. </p> <p>Duran Duran will be guests of honour at today's catwalk show to celebrate a deal to dress them for all tours and public appearances. Tonight, Armani co-hosts, with Graydon Carter, a party to celebrate the launch of Oscar Night: 75 Years of Hollywood Parties, a book of photographs of Oscar party-goers - many of whom, one suspects, will be wearing Armani. </p> <p>This kind of ambitious cross-fertilisation seems to come naturally to Armani. A chain of Armani hotels are in the pipeline, with the first set to open in Dubai. </p> <p>For China - a country seen in the fashion industry as the key market of the next decade - Armani has an ambitious strategy to open 30 stores within four years.</p> <p><b>Trend watch: Chiffon - disobedient, but popular</b></p> <p>Chiffon is not the easiest of fabrics to wear. It floats around rather than sits where it's told; it tends toward transparency and it marks easily. It is, however, pretty and in almost every collection for next season. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Chiffon evening dresses aren't just for 1950s debutantes. Last week in London, Julien Macdonald had a poppy print chiffon strapless babydoll dress, and a sugar pink pleated chiffon gown. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In bold prints, chiffon makes sensational garden party wear - try Betty Jackson's backless butterfly-print number. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> \"Precious\"-looking embroidery and detailing is a good look now. At Emporio Armani yesterday, white chiffon was sprinkled with glass beads.</p>",
  "<b> What's Plan B?</b> <br> <p>The man behind Labour's campaign strategy was a tall, angular MP called Fraser Kemp. Kemp had seldom been seen in public with his candidate, and carried the conspiratorial authority of an old party insider. Allegations of dirty tricks raised only a placid smile.</p> <p>\"When you put down your address on the nomination paper as the Hartlepool marina, after you've given an interview saying 'I love living in Gainford,' - well that's a legitimate thing to target. That's not dirty tricks, that's not personal. That's a question of character.\" He shook his head, as if sorrowful at the Lib Dem's folly.</p> <p>\"[Lord] Rennard and the Lib Dems, they had a really amazing byelection team in the 90s. But I don't see it now; they've lost it. They've had the sword of Damocles hanging over that hospital; they're desperate to see that hospital close. But it isn't happening, and now they haven't got a back up plan. They haven't got a plan B.</p> <p>\"You need to be here 24 hours a day, living it, breathing it. Rennard says he's up here but he isn't; I know he got the 2.30 train yesterday, I saw him at Darlington, and today he's off again. And I know he was in Westminster last week because someone saw him in the Pugin room.\"</p> <p>You have to define your issues, Kemp said, and make them work for you. The hospital had failed for the Lib Dems because it lay beyond their control. What was Iain Wright's defining issue? \"He's a local boy.\"</p> <p>Possibly to prove this, I was allowed to accompany Wright - a season-ticket holder - to Hartlepool United's next home game. An elderly man approached as soon as we reached the terraces. \"You'll win, lad,\" he nodded. 'Cause you're from the town; you know the town - and you're Labour, of course.\" Wright beamed. With victory seeming to beckon, Labour were warming in the glow.</p> <p>The temperature drop in the Lib Dem HQ was palpable. Dunn looked rattled, distracted, and Lord Rennard was indeed absent. Fordham struggled to string together good news; Dunn's name recognition was high, people still liked her, it was clear the Tories couldn't win. Rennard would soon be back; the blog would continue. The team had decided not to \"dignify\" Labour's attacks with a response; \"When there's a personal attack, if it hurts, well it's true. You hold your nerve.\" He looked tense.</p> <p>Plan B was to be the same as plan A; it was still the hospital, stupid. If there had never been any intention to close it, as Blair claimed, then why had 33,000 people had to sign a petition? Dr Evan Harris MP was drafted in from Oxford, and poured over NHS documents hunting out other Labour hospital lies.</p> <p>What about the problem of geography? For once, Fordham snapped. \"Look, Jody's been here 10 weeks. How many towns have had MPs born and bred? Hell-lo?\"</p> <p>A giant poster in the Lib Dem HQ window continued its countdown to the byelection: 13 Days To Save The Hospital. But that afternoon, the Hartlepool Mail carried a photograph of John Reid signing the Save Our Hospital petition. Wright stood behind him, smiling straight into the camera, like a man who was seeing the ink dry on his new contract of employment.</p> <p><b> Kilroy is here!</b><br></p> <p>This is what a byelection looks like on a Saturday morning. Outside the main shopping centre, about 70 Ukip supporters had been bussed in from all over Britain - farming folk mainly, it seemed, who had dressed as if for market day. Over their tweeds they wore bright neon bibs - \"We want our country back\" - and they clutched purple and yellow balloons.</p> <p>The men in dark suits and union flag ties were from a party called the English Democrats. They had brought along a coffin. From down the street marched a troop of overweight men in superman outfits, purple capes and horns, handing hand out Fathers4Justice leaflets. Respect had a stall and a megaphone. An evangelical Teeside church set up a PA system, and pulled out their guitars.</p> <p>\"Jesus Christ healed my body. He healed me from drug addiction. . .\"</p> <p>\"Tuition fees: the Scottish don't pay. Why not? Because you're paying for it! English taxes for English people!\"</p> <p>A rustle stirred through the crowd. \"He's here!\" \"There he is!\" \"He's here?\" \"There!\" Women and children jostled, clambering on benches to see.</p> <p>\"When Beckham missed that penalty. . .\"</p> <p>\"If you're sick of Tony Blair's lies. . .\"</p> <p>\"I were paralytic New Year's Eve, help me God . . .\"</p> <p>Shoppers emerged through the scrum, blinking, stunned. A TV camera pushed through the crowd; photographers jostled. \"Here, just watch this pram a minute.\" \"Go on, shove your way in.\"</p> <p>\"I want to give you more holidays! I want to give you more money! And save your hospital!\"</p> <p>\"Kilroy is here! Kilroy is HERE! KIL-ROY!!\"</p> <p>Out of a purple Ukip van stepped the silvery Robert Kilroy-Silk. A woman rushed to kiss him. Sunshine broke through the cloud, and shone down on a carnival of democracy.</p> <p><b> The balloons are getting bigger</b><br></p> <p>Why does anyone choose to get involved? Fourteen candidates are standing in Hartlepool - some for parties that will spend \u00a3100,000 here, others for parties you have never heard of. Hundreds of activists are working 18-hour days, sleeping on local members' floors, surviving on coffee. They absorb Hartlepool's yawning skies and low horizons, its autumn wind and whining seagulls, the minutiae of its preoccupations. And come Friday, most of them will go home disappointed.</p> <p>They describe it as an obsession, an addiction; their party is their \"family\". Previous byelections are carried like the memories of ex-girlfriends - some to be treasured, others avenged - and every campaigner clings to their favourite, able to recall the exact percentage swing of a 30-year-old victory, right down to the decimal point. By the halfway point of the Hartlepool campaign, each party's strategists had formulated a version of how this one could still be won.</p> <p>For the Tories to escape catastrophe, they had to convince their supporters that a vote for Middleton wasn't a waste. It was a feasible ambition, for local Tory voters are largely unfamiliar with tactical voting. As Kemp put it, \"If you're going to be a Tory here, you might as well be proud of it, 'cause you ain't going to win anything.\" To this end, the Tory campaign settled on crime as its big campaign issue.</p> <p>It wasn't a bad idea, for crime strikes a real chord in Hartlepool, and Middleton has a touch of John Major - a decent man, clearly clever. But out canvassing, his conversation often sounded like a business pitch to an investment bank, and matters weren't helped by his height. He had a tendency to talk down to voters, his nerves translating as impatience. The primitive challenge of asking poor, uneducated, elderly people for their support seemed to defeat him.</p> <p>\"What if I told you,\" he threw at them. \"That I had a plan to take every single hard drug user off the streets of Hartlepool. Would that make a difference?\" They nodded politely, and looked utterly perplexed. Fortunately for Middleton, few pressed him to explain how this policy would work, for when I did he soon unravelled on the detail. The more serious problem was that they did not appear to take it seriously.</p> <p>The challenge for Ukip was to drag the campaign off local issues into a wider debate that might contain Europe. \"We're not electing some kind of super-councillor,\" Allison kept sensibly trying to point out. His press man, Clive Page, was losing patience: \"The hospital's going to close; No it isn't!' 'I come from Hartlepool; No you don't.' Jesus, I've seen married couples have better arguments. We're going to send someone to Westminster on the basis of this?\" He threw up his hands. \"When is this campaign going to grow up?\"</p> <p>The point was legitimate, but the Ukip campaign wasn't so grown up itself. A Kilroy meeting in the Town Hall Theatre failed to draw more than a dozen or so non-party members, and the team's improbable trio of personalities was clashing. \"Piers Merchant won't tell me what's going on,\" Page grumbled. He would cheer himself up by telling funny stories; Steve Harris would roll his eyes, pulling faces behind Page's back. And the party seemed to be growing obsessed with balloons. Every day, they got bigger and bigger. \"When this is all over,\" Harris growled, wrestling with a 20ft purple and yellow inflatable. \"I'll have spent more man hours on these goddamn balloons than any other damn thing.\"</p> <p>The Respect campaign preferred to rely on leaflets and moral authority. In danger of losing both the anti-war and hospital vote to the Lib Dems, their greatest hope lay in helping Labour discredit Dunn, then offering Bloom as the only left-of-centre alternative to Wright. Once again, though, the problem was Bloom's integrity. If anyone could win the local hero contest it was him, but his distaste for smear tactics left him floored.</p> <p>Such qualms did not trouble Labour. Wright was dispatched from HQ every morning to repeat the same message: \"I'm a local boy, and proud of Hartlepool.\" Out canvassing he had a lively, unaffected intimacy on the doorstep, and it appeared to be working. \"You're one of us, aren't you, lad?\" voters would smile. \"Not like that barrister.\"</p> <p>Did voters ever bring up Iraq, I asked?</p> <p>\"I've met more than 4,000 people by now, and do you know?\" Wright said. \"Only two have even mentioned it. It's local issues people care about; that's why they want a local candidate.\" Not five minutes later we met a man who had voted Labour all his life, but wouldn't this time because of the war. \"What an amazing co-incidence,\" Wright marvelled afterwards. \"He was the third.\" The Labour candidate's faithfulness to the message was becoming unnerving; whatever the question, the answer was the same - \"I'm local, and proud of it.\"</p> <p>Ministerial visits came almost daily; John Prescott, David Blunkett, Charles Clarke, Patricia Hewitt all passed through. One conspicuous omission, however, was Tony Blair - and it is hard not to conclude that this was deliberate. Hartlepool is not a New Labour town. The war is not popular here, and the Wright team's eagerness to localise the campaign was in part in a tactic to defuse disenchantment with the government. \"You're not voting for Blair,\" Wright would say on the doorstep. \"You're voting for me.\"</p> <p>Yet gradually, before everyone's eyes, the town was turning orange. More and more Jody Dunn posters were appearing in Labour strongholds, eclipsing the spots of red in windows. The Lib Dems had simply refused to believe the NOP poll, and had marshalled an army of activists from accross the country. Every morning before 9am, between 10 and 50 activists would appear clutching bacon sandwiches and coffee, ready for work, most of them under 30 and many from hundreds of miles away. Mattresses and sleeping bags crowded the attic room. Some brought their dogs along - a black Labrador had campaigned in Leicester South - and badges on the front desk read: \"I was at the Hartlepoolby-election\". Long after midnight, the office still buzzed, as printing machines hummed through the night.</p> <p>The message was a shrewd conflation of disaffection with Blair, and concern for the hospital. Labour can't be trusted on the hospital, their leaflets insisted; Blair has lied before, and he's lying again. The canvassing line never wavered; if you're fed up with Labour, Jody Dunn is your first chance in 40 years for a change . . .</p> <p><b> The hospital is safe . . . no it isn't</b><br></p> <p>The Lib Dem printers hummed through the night: Labour can't be trusted on the hospital, the Lib Dem leaflets insisted; Blair has lied before, and he's lying again. Their message never wavered; if you're fed up with Labour, Jody Dunn is your first chance in 40 years for a change.</p> <p>On the doorstep, she charmed and dazzled: \"Give me a chance. If I'm rubbish, you can get rid of me at the general election next May. Just try me out.\" A woman opened one door and began screaming: \"You've got a cheek coming here! I heard what you said about people in Hartlepool!\" She jabbed a finger hysterically. \"How dare you?\" Ten minutes later, Dunn walked away, and a Lib Dem poster went up in the window.</p> <p>With a little over a week to go, the five candidates assembled for the first public hustings. It was a raucous, smoky debate held in the Corporation Club, organised by the Save Our Hospital Campaign. Iain Wright was never going to do well here; his claim that the hospital was safe was scorned by all four rivals, and the mood was predatory. But Wright made two astonishing errors.</p> <p>Why, someone asked from the floor, had a planning application been made to sell off part of the hospital's land? \"It hasn't,\" Wright flatly denied. Jody Dunn calmly held up a copy of the planning application; Bloom asked how Wright, as a council cabinet minister, could conceivably never have seen it. Then Wright was asked exactly when he had signed the Save Our Hospital petition, because nobody could find his name on it. \"It was in March,\" he said firmly. How was that possible, demanded the questioner, when the petition formally closed last Christmas? \"I - I,\" Wright stammered. \"I can't remember.\"</p> <p>The meeting dissolved in uproar. Wright, visibly shaken, was swept away by a stony entourage. A local Labour member gazed in sorrow. \"The man was a disaster. If that had been a swimming pool he'd have drowned, he was that far out of his depth.\" No one doubted they had witnessed the byelection's defining moment.</p> <p>The following morning, the Hartlepool Mail ran a brief report of the meeting. It made no mention of Wright's self-annihilation, preferring instead to reiterate Blair's pledge that the Hartlepool hospital was safe.</p> <p><b> I'm local you know</b><br></p> <p>A byelection would be incomplete without a conspiracy theory, and all sorts of rumours circulated have been circulating about the Hartlepool Mail in the final week. The previous editor of the paper was sacked last year, following repeated complaints to senior executives from Mandelson. The new editor claimed he had merely printed the story his reporter returned from the hustings meeting with. Mysteriously, though, the report had been absent from the first edition. The editor blamed \"production problems\", but bitter suspicion of a Mandelsonian intervention has not abated.</p> <p>It may have been this which persuaded local Labour members to break their silence about Wright in the closing days of the campaign. Not only are many not campaigning for him. They will not even vote for him, and are plotting to deselect him before the next general election.</p> <p>\"I predict,\" said Keith Fisher, a member of 30 years, \"that regardless of how this Thursday's election goes, there will be a new candidate standing here for Labour in the general election.\"</p> <p>The anger dates back to the candidate selection process in August. Members were given 24 hours to submit nominations by email. Twentysix were submitted, including several long-serving councillors, Mandelson's old election agent, and a former MEP. The NEC vetted them, and presented the local party with a shortlist of three. Wright was the only Hartlepool name on it. \"Local, long-standing members, not even allowed to stand before their own local party? Judged unsuitable even to look at! How can that be? It was shocking - a disgrace,\" Fisher said. \"We were given a choice of one. We felt railroaded into it, and we're seething. I can only assume the NEC had an image of what they wanted, someone who'd say yes to everything and wouldn't rock the boat. And that's Iain Wright for sure. He's a lightweight.\"</p> <p>One of the rejected nominees, a Labour councillor called Robbie Payne, told me had offered to bet another member \u00a31,000 that he could put the name of the winning candidate an envelope, before the entire selection process had begun. \"It's hard to say anything about it without people thinking it's just sour grapes, but the truth is Iain's exactly what New Labour want,\" he sighed. \"A typical puppet, so they can pull his strings. He's got no politics; he doesn't believe in anything.\" Others were praying\" he would lose. Their anger had been stoked by an offer Wright's team had made last month to the local mayor, an independent. In return for the mayor's endorsement, Labour would stand a weak candidate against him at the next mayoral election. The mayor has declined to endorse anyone.</p> <p>Labour won't allow me into their HQ, according to angry members, because the office has had to employ hired hands to stuff envelopes and carry out deliveries. Come the general election, when the budget for this is no longer available, Labour will need the support the local members currently boycotting Wright's campaign - and this will trigger Wright's deselection. \"If he's really the right candidate for us, well then he'll win selection again, won't he?\" shrugged Cllr Payne. Fisher said he \"measured\" Wright by the manner of his selection. But the NEC's decisions were not the candidate's, and there is a danger that with Wright so tightly chaperoned, the vacuum has been filled with unjust speculation. Wright has been a councillor for three years, so has his own record to stand on. Supposing he were elected on Thursday, I asked him what he thought he would be remembered for on the council.</p> <p>\"I think I'd say, being courteous and responsive to local issues. I've tried to be as local a councillor as possible.\"</p> <p>But apart from being local, what else did he offer? The question seemed to throw him. \"Well, I'm local-\"</p> <p>But so was the taxi driver outside - and many of the names rejected by the NEC. If he excluded being local, could he describe his other qualities?</p> <p>\"Well you see I don't think you can exclude it. You see, I'll live in the town.\" But Blair is seldom in Sedgefield, and presumably he didn't think the prime minister ought not be its MP. He looked blank.</p> <p>\"I think I'm bright.\" He paused. \"I think I'm articulate. I've been to university. I can string a sentence together.\" Then he relapsed. \"I think it's absolutely fantastic that one of our own could be going to parliament on Thursday.\"</p> <p>Could he name a single Labour party policy he would be willing to argue against in parliament? \"That's a difficult one.\" He thought about it. \"I would say on a whole range of issues, like the economy, like education, like foreign policy, the Labour government is moving in the right direction.\"</p> <p><b>Campaigning with crosswords</b></p> <p>Hartlepool has been a peculiarly local election, fought not just over local issues, but the very issue of localness. Only Respect and Ukip have expressed any serious ideological commitment, and neither will be sending an MP to Westminster on Friday. The absence of what could be called politics is not exclusive to Labour, though.</p> <p>When I asked Dunn why she was a Liberal Democrat, she said, \"I just feel comfortable with Lib Dems. If I'm in a room with Lib Dems I feel comfortable with them.\" Her position on policy was opaque. \"Well, if you want to go leftwing, rightwing, I've always been more leftwing, I suppose you'd say. But I would say there's a fairness in the Liberal Democrats; there's a respect for difference, and individuals. And that's a very important ethos for me.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dem campaign has concerned itself far more with electoral innovation than policy detail. In the final weekend, it issued the first ever election leaflet to be designed as a glossy women's magazine. Talk of the Town features horoscopes, a crossword and an interview with Claire Rayner, and looks like Take A Break. The Lib Dem's inventiveness extends to the ballot paper itself: each party is allowed six words adjacent to the candidate's name and Lord Rennard has arranged for theirs to read: \"Liberal Democrats - To Save Hartlepool Hospital.\"</p> <p>But they may place too much faith in their famously clever byelection machine. Since Dunn gave a speech last week to party conference, more than 200 activists have poured into Hartlepool, working round the clock to pull off another Brent East or Leicester South. The campaign seems deaf to local irritation. Letters in the Hartlepool Mail complain wearily of overload, but still the party printing machines turn.</p> <p>Hartlepool's windows are blushing bright orange, but Labour may have played a canny game by allowing the Lib Dems to win the poster war, creating an impression of disadvantage to persuade their supporters to bother voting. Their final leaflet reproduces one more time Dunn's blog \"slur\" on the town. \"B****Y CHEEK!\" it screams. If Labour win on Thursday, it will be some time before candidate blogging takes off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1314105,00.html\">Read part one here</a></p>",

  "People will say that Gordon Brown's address to the Labour conference yesterday was a leadership bid. Nonsense. It was a leadership speech. <p>In his mind, he is already leader, leading Britain to fresh, unconquered heights of economic glory. There is more to achieve, of course; there always is. But under his wise and brave and resourceful guidance, it will be achieved. He is the Kim Jong II of the Labour party, the beloved leader (except that Kim Jong II has the title, too). </p> <p>Now and again the chancellor tossed a word of praise to Tony Blair, \"our leader and prime minister\", but it was flung over his shoulder like a 20p piece aimed at a busker's cup. </p> <p>The speech was preceded by a short, heart-warming video entitled A Fish Called Cameron. This was designed to praise his working family tax credits. A Glasgow mum explained how the money had transformed her life. At the end we saw the family buying a goldfish in a plastic bag. The little boy named it Cameron. </p> <p>Under the Tories, working-class people could not afford to feed their little pets, except with cabbage stalks and torn-up copies of the Sun. Now, thanks to Brown, the poorest Glaswegians can buy fish food so luxurious they could eat it themselves for breakfast. In the last century, politicians worried about the gold standard. Now we are reduced to the goldfish standard. </p> <p>Then the chancellor raced to the podium and started talking, or rather gabbling. There was no time to lose! He was the Incredible Hulk, bursting out of his clothes. Even his scarlet tie was bulging. He might explode at any moment, irradiating the conference and making us each grow two heads! </p> <p>Now and again the audience tried to clap, but he talked right through them; there was no time to waste, even when they were wasting it by cheering him. </p> <p>His hands were in constant motion. They flapped up and down, like a goldfish cruising its plastic bag. They were held out as if describing the fish that got away. Sometimes they made a sawing motion, like a killer slicing up the rotting cadaver of the Blair government. </p> <p>Several times the hands slashed up and down, down and up, clearing a toilet blocked with the detritus of Blair's discredited regime, or perhaps just rescuing Cameron, the New Labour fish. Then the arms would be hurled backwards, as if he were a kung fu hero slamming into a dozen enemies at once. </p> <p>He was yelling, shouting, bawling at us. The sweat poured from his temples. His own words were crushed under the steamroller of his rhetoric. \"Flourish\" became \"flush\". \"Peace-time history\" became \"our piss-tie hizzy\". Several times he had to make several runs at a sentence before getting it right. </p> <p>How could he make the end? I feared he might be like Paula Radcliffe and find himself sitting alone on the kerb, exhausted and despairing. </p> <p>But he didn't. He had to tell us! He had to let us know! Yes, the only successes of the Labour government had been his! Yes, the only future successes would be his! His! \"Vision\", \"values\", \"commitment\"! \"No short-termism, no easy options, no irresponsible pre-election promises!\" </p> <p>This might have been the low point of the speech. It has to be remembered that the Labour party is filled with people who love easy options and irresponsible election promises. </p> <p>Then, suddenly, he was in elegiac mode, and we were with a man who had lost an infant daughter and who had just seen his mother lowered into the earth. \"We are not isolated individuals, but we depend on each other. Except Tony Blair!\" </p> <p>Of course he didn't say the last bit. He didn't need to. We knew what he meant. And somewhere, another grateful little goldfish was saved.</p>",
  "Space will no longer be the final frontier if Sir Richard Branson gets his way. His Virgin planes and trains to mobile phones and music empire yesterday announced its most ambitious project to date - commercial space travel. <p>Anyone with the guts and - more importantly - the money will be able to experience weightlessness and gaze back at the Earth from a height of more than 60 miles, something that up to now has been available only to astronauts and billionaires. </p> <p>At \u00a3115,000 for just over four minutes in space it's likely to be the ultimate trip. </p> <p>\"I hope with the launch of Virgin Galactic and the building of our fleet of spacecraft that someday children around the world will wonder why we ever thought that space travel was just a dream we read about in books or watched with longing in Hollywood movies,\" Sir Richard said yesterday as he announced his plans at London's Royal Aeronautical Society. </p> <p>Virgin is pumping $100m (\u00a355m) into the race to space and plans to have its first rocket, the VSS Enterprise, ready for liftoff in 2007. Based on a design created by engineers in the US, the craft will take five passengers plus pilot on a voyage into space. </p> <p>Initially flights will only be available from a special airfield in the Mojave desert of California, but Virgin hopes to have launchsites in Florida, Australia, Singapore and Britain if it can get the necessary export licences to take the rocket out of the US. </p> <p>Astronauts will be given three days' training and Virgin believes anyone in a reasonably healthy state will be able to go up. </p> <p>The spaceship is carried up to 50,000ft slung underneath a specially designed turbojet sailplane. When released its rocket roars into life, blasting the ship straight upwards at three times the speed of sound. To anyone on the ground the sonic boom made by the craft as it breaks the sound barrier is barely audible. </p> <p>As the craft accelerates to more than 2,000 miles an hour in just 25 seconds, passengers will be pressed back into their flat \"beds\" in the pressurised cabin of the rocket. But as the craft escapes the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere - at 10 times the height reached by commercial aircraft - the astronauts on board will be able to unclip their seat belts and float around within the cabin, peering out of its numerous portholes back at the Earth. </p> <p>From 60 miles up, the curvature of the Earth is clearly visible and the horizon is 1,200 miles away. Although technically the craft will not go into orbit around the planet, the view will be spectacular, according to Sir Richard. \"We will be giving people a full treat, something they will remember for the rest of their lives.\" </p> <p>Inside the cabin \"every seat will be an Upper Class seat\", he added. There will not, however, be any in-flight service and astronauts who find the experience a little too invigorating will be dismayed to learn that the ship lacks a toilet. </p> <p>Having nosed its way briefly into space, the craft will start to freefall back to Earth, eventually levelling out at about 50,000ft to begin the long glide back to base in the desert. </p> <p>The entire trip is expected to last up to three hours - making it, at \u00a3640 a minute, probably the most expensive journey in history. </p> <p>Despite the seemingly astronomical price of tickets, Virgin Galactic expects to transform 3,000 people into astronauts in its first five years. To back up its forecasts, Virgin points to research by Nasa which showed that 2% of Americans would happily pay more than $100,000 for a trip into space. </p> <p>To date two wealthy businessmen have become space tourists. Dennis Tito, an American, entered the record books three years ago when he paid $20m for a trip with a Russian crew to the International Space Station. The following year a South African millionaire, Mark Shuttleworth, followed. </p> <p>But Virgin is hoping that as passenger numbers increase, it will be able to bring space travel within the grasp of many more people. \"Virgin Galactic will be run as a busi ness,\" Sir Richard said. \"But as a business with a sole purpose of making space travel more and more affordable to people throughout the world. </p> <p>\"We will reinvest funds raised over the first few years of flight, back into the business to lower prices.\" </p> <p>Virgin Galactic's initial fleet of five spacecraft will not be able to reach the height needed for an orbit of the Earth, but it is already looking towards a second-generation orbital craft and, eventually, a hotel in space. </p> <p>The craft's designer, Burt Rutan, who also created the Voyager aircraft which flew around the world non-stop without refuelling in 1986, is setting his sights even farther. \"This is a first step, it's an important first step. [But] I hope in my lifetime to see affordable trips to the moon.\" </p> <p>While space travel has been a decade-long ambition of Sir Richard, who has made of a name for himself with his own daredevil stunts, it has only entered the realms of commercial viability in the past few years. </p> <p>The Virgin craft is based on SpaceShipOne, which was created by Mr Rutan to try to win the $10m XPrize, an award set up to encourage non-governmental manned space flights. </p> <p>His company, Scaled Composites, has been backed by Paul Allen, the multi-billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, for the attempt. </p> <p>In June SpaceShipOne reached a height of 62.5 miles in a test flight above the Californian desert. On Wednesday it will take the first of two flights to try to win the prize. </p> <p>But environmentalists are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of aviation on the global climate. Howard Cambridge, research associate at the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York, said more work needed to be done to ensure that Virgin Galactic did not exacerbate the problem. </p> <p>\"It certainly needs to be addressed before you start launching rockets here there and everywhere, and when you look at the number of passengers who will benefit from space travel the environmental impact per passenger will be quite high,\" he said. </p> <p>The safety of space flight is also a concern, and while Mr Rutan promised that flying on the VSS Enterprise would be safer than taking a trip on an early airliner, \"No one is going to be able to claim or guarantee that commercial space flight ... will be as safe as a 747.\"</p> <p><b>Luxury breaks</b><br> <b>\u00b7</b> Stay at the International Space Station: American millionaire Dennis Tito became the world's first space tourist in April 2001, after paying \u00a314m to make his dream of 30 years come true. His millions bought a lift aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that arrived at the International Space Station in 2001. The businessman then enjoyed an eight-day break on the station, 245 miles above the Earth. A second tourist, South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth, took off in 2002 but two subsequent trips have been cancelled. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Take a MiG-25 jet fighter flight: Tourists can fly up to 85,000ft and travel faster than twice the speed of sound in the Russian jets. The price of seeing the curvature of the Earth below and the blackness of space above is \u00a39,000. For that you even get two nights' bed and breakfast. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Dive to the Titanic: Nearly 20 years after it was discovered, the world's most famous shipwreck is now regularly visited by tourists paying \u00a328,500 to descend into the Atlantic depths in a submersible. In July 2001 a couple from New York got married in a submersible on the deck of the ship, while other divers have attempted to recoup the costs of their trip by searching for buried treasure around the disintegrating wreck. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Drive a formula one car: An overnight break in the UK which includes a day of training, laps of a racetrack in hot hatches, a Porsche 911 and a spin in a real F1 machine can be bought for \u00a31,350. Drivers also get a lap with a professional to show them what real speed is all about. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Circumnavigate the globe: It may seem pedestrian by comparison, but plenty of wealthy thrill-seekers prefer to invest their thousands in a more leisurely grand world tour. A luxury 23-day tour, including travel on three Orient Express trains and flights, costs \u00a338,000.</p>",

  "Gareth Stedman Jones recommends New Labour revive its fortunes by embracing the free-market egalitarianism of the Enlightenment (Tony Blair needs a big idea, September 25). Now that Gladstonian liberalism is out of favour, it seems we're to be offered ... Jacobin radicalism. <p>But Stedman Jones omitted to tell us the outcome last time it was tried. Ground between the free-market liberalism of its bourgeois supporters and the egalitarian demands of the popular revolutionary movement, the French Jacobin regime of 1793-94 collapsed and its leaders went to the guillotine - victims of what Marxists call \"a contradiction\". </p> <p>The market promotes inequality. Collective action promotes equality. You have to choose. That's not just theory, but the lesson of history.<br> <b>Neil Faulkner</b><br> University College London </p> <p>Stedman Jones's suggestion that the ideas of The Wealth of Nations can be applicable today fails to take into account that ideas have to be seen in the context of the world in which they are formed. Adam Smith wrote at a time of burgeoning capitalism, with a state and social relations that were still feudal and a brake on progress. Today capitalism is in decline, reflected by war, poverty, destruction of the environment, growing inequality and disillusion with parliamentary democracy. Social democracy never questioned the division of society into workers and owners. It was given a stay of execution by Stalinism and the cold war, but now its time is up.<br> <b>Pat Brady</b><br> Chislehurst, Kent </p> <p>Stedman Jones suggests that we should aim to \"combine the benefits of individual freedom and commercial society with an ideal of inclusive citizenship and the public good\".

They certainly would not have suggested the coming together of commercial society and the state to solve the \"problem\" of inequality. </p> <p>Adam Smith wrote: \"For one very rich man there must be at least 500 poor ...\" And if you accept Smith as \"gospel\", as many do, then the fewer very rich men there are, the fewer poor there will be.<br> <b>Alex Shaw</b><br> Stoke-on-Trent </p> <p>Smith stood on the threshold of industrialisation, but even he could see that markets make for inequality. His language of citizenship and democratic enlightenment was not, as Stedman Jones implies, lost in the 19th century by some awful accident. Rather, a language suitable for capitalism in its foetal stage proved inadequate for conceptualising, let alone constraining, the adult beast. In its place, the left developed a language of socialism, centred on the insight that a society of true citizenship and democracy would never be possible within an unrestrained free-enterprise economy. </p> <p>This spoke more clearly to an age in which economic power proved a more immediate and iniquitous source of oppression than the force and fraud of the state. And it still does, in our own age of multi-national companies and globalised capital movements. Of course, 19th-century socialists are no more the answer to today's political problems than 18th-century liberals, but both have lessons to teach us.<br> <b>David Stack</b><br> University of Reading</p>",
  "David Blunkett often gives the impression that he's in the middle of some secret parlour game where you have to make 15 sentences using only four unrelated words. \"The discipline of amateur-boxing training,\" he said last week, \"can give young people the chance to keep fit, learn sportsmanship and self-discipline and benefit from the support of a mentor in their boxing coach.\" <p>Right ... yeah, kind of. Although you could substitute \"boxing\" for any sport at all, apart from archery (not very aerobic), and still be left with the same net benefits, without the pressing danger of getting your head smashed in. </p> <p>He continues: \"It can also offer positive routes into training, education and employment, as many young people who are beginning to master the sport are finding.\" </p> <p>I don't understand what a positive route into training is; or a positive route into education, for that matter. I don't understand what employment opportunities could possibly blossom for a person beginning to master effective and systematised punching. I would say that the skill is surplus and generally irrelevant to the requirements of all jobs. Even the army plays down hand-to-hand combat, and usually supplies weapons. </p> <p>Sorry, there is one job where it might be useful to know how to box, and that's boxing. So, learning to box can offer a positive route into being a boxer. With this dazzling insight in mind, the government is injecting a modest amount of money into 26 boxing-training projects. This will offer a positive route into a training project with a boxing mastery objective. </p> <p>The British Medical Association, killjoy that it is, counters that \"funding should be directed to activities that do not present the risk of deliberate brain injury to young people\". I detect a bit of litotes, there - I bet when they had their meeting about what kind of press release to send out, the majority were in favour of a statement like \"You absolute lunatics! What on earth are you playing at, teaching youngsters to brain each other?\", until a bright spark suggested understatement, for comic effect. </p> <p>Clearly, there is a reason this sport fell from favour in schools and youth clubs: it's something to do with the deleterious effect it has on a person's IQ, to sustain repeated head injury. I'm minded here of the take-the-yob-to-the-cashpoint idea, mooted by Blair when he was trying to be tough on crime. Whenever a politician gives a feverish endorsement to an obviously stupid scheme, it's usually because they're trying to convey some broad message to which the scheme itself is generally irrelevant. So what exactly is Blunkett's message? </p> <p>First off, he's trying to sound macho. Perhaps he's smarting from the fact that it's always John Prescott who punches troublemakers and rescues canoeists. Let's leave that for the biography (and won't that be a page-turner). I think he's a bit slow off the mark, here - boxing may once have been a quintessentially male sport, but it is now a cross-gender, fashionable activity, to the degree that without even having to look anything up, I could name you five female celebrities who box (oh, go on then - Martine McCutcheon, Sadie Frost, three Sugababes). But never mind that - Blunkett still thinks of it as male, and furthermore, working class. </p> <p>Discussing the role of the sport in his constituency, he talks about \"deprived areas\", \"young men\", \"positive role models\". We're clearly on fight-club territory, not boxercise. And there's something nostalgic about the ideal he presents; a bygone world where young men dealt with their poverty by unleashing their manliness in an organised fashion, finding self-respect and a sense of responsibility therein. In a timeline of social conservatism, boxing would crop up somewhere between curfews and bringing back national service. The spiel about his Sheffield constituency, and its thriving boxing culture, rams home the point that this is an attack on the effeminised south, with its sissy, compensation-hungry, \"please don't hit me in the face, it might hurt\" manners. </p> <p>Perhaps what we're seeing, besides, is a man trying to distance himself from the nannying reputation of his political environment. While his colleagues seek to protect us from ourselves by banning supersized sugary treats, Blunkett alone treats us as adults, with all the rights that status carries: self-determination, responsibility, the right to pummel each other in the kidneys and learn to love the consequences. </p> <p>In conclusion, this is no poncy politician with opera on his ringtone - this is a salt-of-the-earth, old-fashioned man, who could out-Prescott John, and who crashed into a seat of power through manly graft, probably with a lot of sweat involved. I don't begin to understand why he would want to revamp his image in this direction; maybe he's just sick and tired of his girly job title, and how it makes him sound like he's at home, and also that he's a secretary. </p> <p>Ultimately, the scale of the boxing funding is fairly small, and the young men involved would probably have found a way to punch each other with or without the improved facilities. But stay tuned for the \"what this country needs is a spell of national service\" speech. It might just be a conference highlight. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams@ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams@ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On a busy night in the maternity ward of Milton Keynes hospital, 10 tiny citizens of the new town are added to its burgeoning population. In a couple of nights, there could easily be enough children to fill a reception class five years down the line and, in a month, you would be well on your way to filling an entire primary school. Which is why Milton Keynes has perhaps the most astonishing school building plans in Britain.</p> <p>This term, three new primary schools are opening. Two opened their doors in state-of-the-art buildings at the beginning of term. A third, an ecumenical school, is occupying rooms borrowed from the Open University with a view to moving into new buildings before Christmas.</p> <p>Inside one of the new schools, Middleton combined, there is an office occupied by the newly appointed headteacher of Oakgrove, the comprehensive school across the fields (though the freshly erected builders' metal fencing is the only physical evidence of it). Next September, the first pupils will be admitted. It is one of two new 1,500-pupil comprehensives being built. And in two weeks' time the builders move in on yet another greenfield site to begin work on another new primary school, even though the first houses in the area have yet to be built.</p> <p>At Shenley Brook End, a comprehensive that opened in 1997 with just 120 pupils, the final building phase has just opened. This will allow it to admit 1,500 pupils in all - 300 more than initially planned. It should now have enough space to meet the needs of its catchment area, which it hasn't been able to do in some years. Coping with demand from outside its catchment area, however, is another matter.</p> <p>After a frenetic period of bidding for government funding, Milton Keynes is beginning to create a few surplus places so that there will be room for the new population as it arrives. It needs to. Some 70,000 new houses are to be built over the next 30 years, doubling the current population to around 500,000. On the way it will overtake the population of sizeable cities - Cardiff, for example - and eventually be the 10th or 11th largest city in the country.</p> <p>Euan Henderson, deputy leader of Milton Keynes council, who is spearheading the school building programme, says: \"We were extremely keen to get to a position where we could stop playing catch-up.\"</p> <p>The amounts of money involved are mind-boggling. The school capital programme requires \u00a3100m to be spent by 2010 on new building and \u00a35m a year on refurbishing and upgrading older buildings. By next September, Milton Keynes will have provided an extra 3,000 school places in just three years.</p> <p>It is a remarkable turnaround for a town which 10 years ago was deliberately building schools one or two classrooms short because it did not have enough money for the whole job. A town whose own planning authority stopped giving permission to build more temporary classrooms because school sites were so disfigured by their proliferation. A town where schools were never built before the new housing estates arrived, and parents had to chase available places.</p> <p>Now almost the opposite is the case, particularly with primary schools. Some parents chase the latest new school to open, with children switching several times. In year 6 at Middleton, the 26 children have come from 17 different schools. One of the children has changed schools nine times.</p> <p>The blitz on providing school places is in part due to effective collaboration between the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and Milton Keynes council, a unitary authority since it was divorced from Buckinghamshire in 1997. The Liberal Democrat leadership, which took over from Labour in May 2002, has prioritised school building and is also in the process of seeing through a change in the age of secondary transfer from 12 to 11.</p> <p>The programme is paying dividends in recruiting staff. Middleton has been attracting up to 20 applications for every teaching post advertised - and this in an area where housing is not cheap and which does not benefit from any of the London weighting allowances. The nursery assistant posts have each attracted a staggering 100 applicants.</p> <p>Headships and deputy headships have also been filled with relative ease, and although the secondary schools are affected by the national shortage of teachers in areas such as maths, sciences and foreign languages, they are still managing to recruit good-quality staff.</p> <p>Seeing the new schools, it isn't surprising. They are built to space standards that exceed the DfES's new improved standards, and to eye-catching designs that make them a pleasure to walk into.</p> <p>Middleton would look like an eye to any passing bird, with its central white-painted rotunda housing the school hall and gym, central courtyards and everything else stowed away in the curved buildings around it. Inside, light pipes and window-shaped holes in internal walls ensure everywhere has natural light. Outside, there are seating pods curved liked the corridors inside, a see-through and well-used bicycle shed, and a sensory garden with a wild flower meadow to come.</p> <p>A wireless network provides interactive, touch-sensitive whiteboards in classrooms, operated by teachers standing at a podium. Webcams are going in, which will allow the head to observe lessons and let teachers see tapes of their own lessons. A panel of headteachers with experience of opening new schools has been advising the city's own architecture department, Architecture MK.</p> <p>There are already 260 pupils in the school - eventually there will be 420 - but, even with the hall full of lunching children it smells fresh because wind catchers on the roof are constantly recycling the air. The school library is spacious and inviting, the staff room a hymn to Ikea.</p> <p>The head, Jane Miller, is ecstatic about the place. The school actually opened in September last year in the rooms at the Open University that it has just vacated to give the ecumenical primary a temporary home. (A colony of great crested newts discovered on site delayed the project for a year while the creatures were rehoused.)</p> <p>\"It's so light and spacious,\" says Miller. \"The parents love it, too. I've been teaching in Milton Keynes for 27 years and have been deputy head of another new school, but that didn't have the sense of community it does here.\"</p> <p>The children are pretty impressed, as well. Stephanie is 11 and came here from a village school in neighbouring Buckinghamshire. \"I like it because it's lovely and light. And the toilets are much nicer. The toilets at my last school had bits of paper that had been flicked on to the ceiling, making it all bumpy. And they smelt.\"</p> <p>Graham Hussey, a secondary school teacher in Milton Keynes and spokesman for the local branch of the National Union of Teachers, says teachers locally are pleased to see new schools being built. Even the size of some of the secondaries - 1,500 planned for Shenley Brook End and the two new comprehensives - was not a worry.</p> <p>\"The size of the schools is no great surprise,\" he says. \"In rural areas, comprehensives have to be big because they are the only secondary school for miles. It's a geographical issue, too, because the original schools were built in the old towns in the north and the south or in the centre of Milton Keynes. Now, due to demographic change, the population is moving to the east and the west - so that's where you need the new schools.</p> <p>\"As long as they can recruit enough teachers it will be OK and, apart from the odd maths teacher shortage, they do seem to be doing that.\"</p> <p>Research confirms that working environments have a profound effect on the morale of those working in them, and Milton Keynes is now bucking a trend that saw it performing poorly academically. Euan Henderson says fewer children are now being sent to grammar schools in Buckinghamshire or to selective, fee-paying schools in Bedford for their secondary education.</p> <p>There are plenty who believe improved performance is influenced by the quality of school environment. \"It has to make a difference,\" says Glenn Martin, acting headteacher of Shenley Brook End. \"They know money has been spent on them and the vast majority of pupils will respond to that. It makes them feel valued. Also, we have a very stable staff and staff absence is very low.\"</p> <p>Barbara Dunsire, an architect with Architecture MK, says of the new buildings: \"There is an uplifting element that makes the people in them feel important and that they are part of something they can be justly proud of.\"</p> <p>The education department recently received a letter from David Miliband, the schools minister, commending it on the improvements in its key stage 2 results, which have made it one of the most improved councils in the country. Already, Shenley Brook End is producing results way above what would be expected from the children when they are assessed on arrival. This summer, 81% of pupils got at least five A-C grades at GCSE, when their scores on arrival suggested the figure would be nearer 55%. At A-level, it is now one of the top- performing comprehensives in the country. This year, the A-level pass rate was 99% and the percentage getting all A-C grades was 70%. Two students are going to Cambridge this autumn.</p> <p>There are schools in Milton Keynes that are not doing well - the head of Shenley Brook End is on secondment to one in special measures - but they tend to be in older buildings in the older towns that have been subsumed within the new city. These are the schools that are losing population and are being refurbished with improved layouts, possible with fewer pupils.</p> <p>With more attractive surroundings and a continued supply of good-quality teachers wanting to work in Milton Keynes, the possibilities for improvement are there. The new city is ready for whatever those maternity wards can throw at them.</p>",
  "When, on August 31 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris, Labour had been in power for little more than three months. <p>In the immediate aftermath of the accident, the royal family appeared distant, outmoded and out of touch. They were also divided. Buckingham Palace was at war with Kensington Palace and the Spencer family, while St James's Palace was at war with both Buckingham and Kensington palaces. </p> <p>Their disarray gave the new regime in Downing Street the opportunity to seize the initiative. In the course of numerous meetings between representatives of Downing Street and Buckingham Palace, it soon became clear that the old guard at court under the Earl of Airlee, the Lord Chamberlain, did not know how to cope with this outpouring of emotion for someone they had detested in life and who now seemed to have triumphed over them in death. Royal aides say this was the one moment when the monarchy was genuinely in jeopardy. </p> <p>In these circumstances, Tony Blair's secret weapon was Anji Hunter, who became the vital intermediary between the palaces and No 10. Hunter, along with Blair's \"funeral expert\", Hilary Coffman, who had organised John Smith's official departure from this world, tried to smooth over bad relations. </p> <p>Prince Charles and Blair also received advice from Peter Mandelson, always \"anxious to help\". Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary (now Lord Butler), who was, unlike Alastair Campbell, a staunch monarchist, also played a key role in trying to persuade the Queen to make a more sympathetic response to the outpouring of public grief. </p> <p>The Prince of Wales took advice from both Downing Street and his own advisers, and followed his instincts by flying to France to escort Diana's body on its journey back to London. The aim, which was to some extent achieved, was to distance Prince Charles from his fellow royals, who remained aloof at Balmoral. </p> <p>Anji Hunter's meetings at Buckingham Palace, combined with a telephone call between Blair and the monarch, finally persuaded the royal family to emerge from their seclusion and do a walkabout among the crowds outside Buckingham Palace. The Queen - who doesn't \"do live\", as an aide put it - agreed to speak from a prepared script on the BBC's Six O'Clock News. </p> <p><b>Influence</b><br> </p> <p>Blair's aides had one last task to perform on behalf of Prince Charles. They were not convinced that the public really believed he felt any guilt or grief over the loss of Diana - and they were right. He would never recover popular support unless the public's perception changed. An opportunity arose when Charles had to make his first public speech after the funeral in Manchester on September 19. He was very reluctant to make any gesture. His view, according to one royal source, was that \"nothing that had happened had anything to do with him\" and he wanted to stick to that. </p> <p>But Mandelson and Campbell felt that he should say something or else the press would have a field day. They had the backing of Blair to press their case. Between them, they scripted his speech. The prince told his audience: \"I am unbelievably proud of my children. They have been quite remarkable and I think have handled an extraordinary difficult time, as I am sure you can all imagine, with quite enormous courage and the greatest possible dignity. </p> <p>\"They are coping extraordinarily well but obviously Diana's death has been an enormous loss as far as they are concerned and I will always feel that loss.\" </p> <p>This - the only public expression of sorrow at Diana's death that has ever been made by her former husband - marked the high tide of Downing Street's influence over the royal family. </p> <p>Not only had Blair's aides helped to script the prime minister's own response to Diana's death; they had now put words into the mouth of the heir to the throne. Campbell had even \"rebranded\" the prince's dead wife as the People's Princess. Relations were never going to get any better than this. </p> <p>In fact, they soon deteriorated. At first, Blair had managed to introduce his reform programme without angering the prince. Prince Charles did not approve of the Scottish parliament, Welsh devolution or the plans to abolish hereditary peers in the Lords, but he let these things pass, since the government had such a resounding democratic mandate. </p> <p>Blair, for his part, had even tempered party policy on fox hunting, a sport greatly enjoyed by Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles and Prince William. According to aides, the prime minister personally assured the prince that \"hunting will be banned slowly\" - a private pledge that he has kept, despite Labour's manifesto commitment to a complete ban. </p> <p>But Prince Charles was irritated by the informal style that Blair adopted in correspondence. </p> <p>An American-style informality was a trademark of New Labour's modernising agenda; everybody in Downing Street addressed each other by first names and every letter from the prime minister was signed: \"Yours, Tony\". When Blair corresponded with the palace he signed himself in the same matey fashion, and he addressed the Prince of Wales not as \"Your Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales\" but as \"Dear Prince Charles\". The prince pointedly replied by writing \"Dear Prime Minister\" rather than \"Dear Tony\". </p> <p>Another blow to the relationship came with the highly embarrassing disclosure on December 22 1998 that Mandelson had lied about the way in which he had financed the purchase of his \u00a3475,000 home in Notting Hill. Mandelson's first resignation from the cabinet came after the revelation that he had received an undisclosed \u00a3373,000 loan from a fellow minister, Geoffrey Robinson - and then lied on his mortgage application form when he borrowed money from the Britannia building society to supplement the loan from Robinson. </p> <p>Prince Charles was aghast at the first revelation; when he understood that the minister had also lied in his mortgage application, he was even more shocked. The result was a decision to cut Mandelson out of any future social engagements. The prince resolved to write to Mandelson a personal note making it clear that he was persona non grata so far as St James's Palace was concerned. But his aides persuaded him to at least delay the letter, fearing that it would be leaked. </p> <p>Prince Charles's decision was a huge blow to Mandelson. This was the man who had gone to great lengths to get an invitation to the prince's 50th birthday party and boasted that he was the only cabinet minister to attend. In fact, his invitation had come from Camilla Parker Bowles, not from Prince Charles, and it was part of a thank-you gesture to Peter Brown - a partner in the lobbying company Brown Lloyd James. </p> <p>Mandelson had also managed to spend a weekend at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate, with Charles and Camilla. His eagerness to ingratiate himself with the royals had made him the butt of jokes at the Downing Street leaving party for Tim Allen, Alastair Campbell's deputy, who said he was privileged to be \"a friend of Peter's ... when I am not, as far as I am aware, a member of the royal family\". </p> <p>The prince eventually sent his letter to Mandelson once the story had disappeared from the headlines, confident that the palace could rely upon a crestfallen Mandelson to keep its contents to himself. Their confidence was clearly justified, since Mandelson apparently told neither of his biographers about the letter. </p> <p>Still, the prince lost a useful connection to Tony Blair when Mandelson was excommunicated, and he would soon lose another: Anji Hunter. </p> <p>The relationship between Camilla Parker Bowles and the prince had been troubling Blair and Cherie, who were concerned about Camilla's ambiguous position as the acknowledged mistress of the future king of England. Hunter was therefore dispatched to St James's Palace to sound out the prince's aides on his future intentions. She was also meant to convey a private warning to the prince that it was \"make your mind up\" time. </p> <p>Though Hunter is a deft operator, the moment she raised the issue, the aides made it clear that the prince would have nothing to do with it. After a rather short discussion, the prince's advisers said that the matter was closed; it was never raised again. </p> <p>The final area of disagreement between the Blair court and an increasingly isolated Prince of Wales concerned foreign policy - culminating in Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq. Already strongly opposed to the government's policies on globalisation and GM food, the prince was equally critical of Tony Blair's relationship with George and Laura Bush. And he thought it wrong to intervene in Iraq without the support of the United Nations. </p> <p>But the prince's opinions were, by now, becoming less and less important to Downing Street. Increasingly, the handwritten missives - known as \"black spider memos\" - fired off from St James's Palace went ignored by Downing Street. Prince Charles, as one aide puts it, \"had been put back in his box\". </p> <p>What started out as a promising and vibrant relationship between the prime minister and the heir to the throne has declined into a distinctly cool acquaintanceship. </p> <p>Today, there is no meeting of minds between the embattled prime minister and an isolated prince.</p> <p><b>Foot and mouth: minister's threat to sue inquiry</b></p> <p>In 2002, in the aftermath of the foot and mouth epidemic, Tony Blair decided there should be an inquiry into the crisis. </p> <p>It was not to be an independent public inquiry, like the one demanded by environment minister Michael Meacher, who was slapped down for suggesting it. </p> <p>Instead it was to be held in private, with no transcripts, and chaired by a man already sympathetic to the prime minister's views - Iain Anderson, a former chairman and chief executive of a worldwide range of Unilever subsidiaries involved in agribusiness, chemicals and food. </p> <p>If the inquiry was already skewed in Downing Street's favour, Nick Brown, who had been agriculture minister during the outbreak, was hardly reassured when he discovered that Jeremy Heywood, the principal private secretary at No 10, was having private lunches with Alun Evans, secretary to the inquiry, during the hearings. </p> <p>Evans is a former director of communications for the Department of Transport, and had also held posts in Downing Street. </p> <p>Brown, however, suspected that the meetings were part of an attempt by the prime minister to manipulate the inquiry into blaming his agriculture minister for the crisis. </p> <p>So grave were Brown's concerns that the Treasury solicitor was, at one point, providing legal advice to both Brown and Downing Street. </p> <p>The correspondence is said to include an extraordinary submission from Brown that he wanted the report's parliamentary privilege revoked so that he would be free to sue the authors if they tried to make him a scapegoat. </p> <p>Rather than risk the potentially huge embarrassment of an open confrontation with a government minister (by now Brown had been moved to the Department for Work and Pensions), Downing Street backed down - and the report was toned down. </p> <p><b>Carole Caplin: Aide helped PM unwind</b></p> <p>Cherie first met Carole Caplin at a fitness class in 1992; by 2003, she was paying Caplin \u00a33,500 a month for assistance with dress, fitness and \"lifestyle\". </p> <p>\"She was at the Blairs' beck and call,\" says someone who knew Carole well. \"I remember her saying she'd just spent seven hours clearing Tony's wardrobe, deciding what to keep, what to throw away, what to give to charity.\" Caplin even had her own nickname for Blair. </p> <p>She does not smoke or drink, but she loves chocolate - and she dubbed the prime minister \"Toblerone\". It seemed to amuse him. </p> <p>We have all been led to believe that Caplin was Cherie's confidante only; the truth is that she has been as much Tony's friend as Cherie's. When Cherie was away, Carole would often go to the Downing Street flat to keep Tony company. </p> <p>\"Cherie's away, I'm babysitting this weekend,\" she would say, or: \"He's lonely, I'm going to the flat for a couple of hours.\" During the run-up to the Iraq war, in 2003, she went to Chequers and found Tony very tense. \"I made him take a bath and gave him a reiki massage. He's really stressed but that'll get him through till Thursday,\" she told a friend. </p> <p>\u00a9 David Hencke/Francis Beckett, 2004</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Blairs and Their Court by Francis Beckett and David Hencke is published by Aurum Press on October 14.</p>",
  "<p>How will we find the Susan Greenfields and Stephen Hawkings of the future? It is no secret that low demand is a big issue in physical sciences from school level up, and a recent spate of closures of specialist university departments has added fuel to the fire. Will this mean an academic recruitment crisis a few years down the line?</p> <p>Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) show the number of universities enrolling in physics fell by 18% between 1994-95 and 2001-02. For materials sciences, the drop was 33%, and for combinations within physical sciences it was 13%. Chemistry stayed steady, but since then has seen high profile department closures, including at Kings College London and Queen Mary College. Only 40 chemistry departments remain in British universities.</p> <p>The government admits there is a problem. In a recent speech to the Universities UK conference in Oxford, education secretary, Charles Clarke, said closures of specialist departments are \"rational market decisions [by universities] which don't necessarily meet the wider national interest\".</p> <p>Looking behind the closures, a web of issues emerge. Answering a parliamentary question in April, Alan Johnson, then higher education minister, said of the two London departments: \"These closures were largely due to a lack of demand for the undergraduate chemistry courses concerned.\"</p> <p>Certainly, there is an element of that, although there has actually been a slight upturn in undergraduate numbers for chemistry in the last year, according to Willie Rennie, responsible for Scottish parliamentary affairs at the Royal Society of Chemistry. The five years prior to that saw, he says, a 30% drop in both chemistry and physics.</p> <p>But Professor Duncan Bruce, head of the chemistry department at Exeter University, argues: \"Closures are not necessarily due to lack of demand, rather to lack of money.\"</p> <p>Undergraduate funding is not provided on a subject-by-subject basis, leaving universities to balance the books across disciplines. Chemistry is a very expensive subject.</p> <p>At the same time, there is a trend away from pure physical sciences to more vocational courses. According to Dr Ruth Shiner, principal lecturer in biomedical sciences at Wolverhampton University, it is not so much the case that take-up in science subjects overall has fallen, as that more applied courses, such as forensic science or environmental sciences are replacing traditional options.</p> <p>Hesa figures show a 13% increase in the seven years to 2001/2 in the number of universities enrolling for environmental and other sciences. This trend, says Universities UK (UUK), reflects universities responding to \"significant changes in student demand\".</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the closure of departments can only perpetuate the decline in pure physical sciences. But at least the academic recruitment crisis has not struck yet. According to Bruce, \"there are still a number of very good applicants out there\". Whether the crisis will come depends largely on whether the trend of closing departments continues. \"We don't know what the extent of provision in the sector will look like in a few years' time,\" Bruce says.</p> <p>Moreover, it is too early to see what the impact will be of the shift to applied sciences. If Shiner is right, 18-year-olds increasingly will seek courses with a clear career path. This does not suggest that large numbers of future graduates in forensic science or environmental science will want to become chemistry academics.</p> <p>Nor would they necessarily be qualified to become so. \"Some people are quite negative, saying the skills are not transferable,\" says Rennie. \"The real test is whether they manage to shape courses so they are. The jury's out.\"</p> <p>Shiner stresses that such courses have a strong underlying element of pure chemistry. But today's undergraduates in forensic science et al are being taught by trained pure chemists. Would they, in turn, be qualified to teach chemistry? She agrees there could be a problem \"maybe 30 to 40 years down the line\".</p> <p>All this is set in a context of international competition for academics. How, then, are British physics and chemistry departments to produce and keep the brilliant academics of the 21st century? The answer begins at school level, says Rennie. A decline in numbers studying chemistry at A-level and Higher level is, he warns, \"having a knock-on effect on applications to university\".</p> <p>It is no secret that the UK needs more science teachers, with enthusiasm and the proper qualifications. Rennie also calls for greater investment in school labs.</p> <p>The next step is attracting students to study physical sciences at university, including, crucially, keeping departments open. \"I would like to see more realistic levels of funding at undergraduate level,\" says Bruce.</p> <p>Moves are afoot. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) plans to move towards subject weights based on full economic costs - clearly beneficial for the sciences.</p> <p>For individual universities, there are no hard and fast rules to attract students. According to Bruce, the young age profile of the department staff is probably a factor for Exeter, which has a full undergraduate chemistry department. He adds: \"I think they like to look at departments that pay a good deal of attention to teaching and have flexible course structures. And I think they like nice places. The campus is stunningly beautiful here.\"</p> <p>Then there is the need for an image make-over. Sir Gareth Roberts reported to the government in 2002 that drops in enrolments might be due to a perception that science degrees are harder than other subjects. The government intends, it says, to change this perception through \"improved staffing and the teaching environment of these subjects\".</p> <p>University departments can help, Bruce adds, by working with pre- university students to introduce them to science. Exeter's physics department runs a residential course for sixth-formers.</p> <p>The next step is getting students to stay to postgraduate level and beyond. At that point, says Bruce, each university needs to show \"a strong research environment\". Rennie adds: \"The UK has quite a good reputation for science and the government has invested decent amounts in research, but continuing to build on that will be important.\"</p> <p>To attract high-quality academics in a global market, the UK needs to compete on salaries, too. Professor Ivor Crewe, president of Universities UK, says: \"The academic labour market is global and we must compete effectively in it to replenish an expanding profession and sustain the UK research base.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Test of strength</strong></p> <p>It is the thoughtful touches that we will want to remember about the Learning and Skills Council. Like giving Charles Kennedy a chance to retrain. This may have been the Liberal Democrat leader's best conference yet. But it is best to prepare for the worst, which is presumably why in a corner of the conference, courtesy of the LSC, Kennedy was given a tutorial by Daniel Timms, an 18-year-old trainee engineer, in how to test the strength of metals using a tensometer.

  "Klaus Hinrichsen, who has died aged 92, was an important champion of \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists who, like him, had fled to Britain during the 1930s to escape Nazi persecution. While interned in Hutchinson camp on the Isle of Man during the early 1940s, he befriended other German and Austrian scientists, musicians and artists - most notably Erich Kahn and the dadaist Kurt Schwitters. <p>Hinrichsen helped to establish what became known as the \"Hutchinson University\", where internees could while away the hours behind barbed wire in a creative spirit. As head of the cultural department, he curated art exhibitions that included work by Schwitters, on whom he became a leading authority and advocate in later years. </p> <p>The eldest son of a family of four children, Hinrichsen was born and raised in L\u00fcbeck, a town with a long democratic tradition. His father, a lawyer, had converted to Christianity - his forebears were Sephardic Jews from Portugal - and brought his children up as Lutheran Protestants. His mother, a teacher, came from farming stock. </p> <p>Hinrichsen's early experience of school and family life was distinctly dadaist in spirit. His maternal grandfather, for instance, was a specialist in hail-damage insurance and kept a pack of poodles, which he trained to jump through hoops. </p> <p>At school, Greek was taught in Latin. The doctor who gave sex education lessons was blind, while the English teacher, who had been shot through the throat during the first world war, could hardly be heard. For a long time, Hinrichsen believed that English should only be whispered. The art master told the boys to paint their own funerals, and rode to school on a bicycle holding an umbrella above his head, whatever the weather. </p> <p>While still at school, Hinrichsen, whose special interests were German romantic poetry and art, edited a magazine called Viereck or Four Corners, with three friends. Its supporters included the local museum curator, who asked Hinrichsen to help him curate exhibitions, mostly of German Expressionists. </p> <p>In 1931, Hinrichsen went to read art history, theatre history and archaeology at Munich University, and, during the following two years, spent time in Berlin, where he heard Hitler speak - the stage-managed entrance was mesmerising, he recalled, but the rhetoric was unimpressive. He completed his PhD (on the early baroque sculptor Tonnies Evers) in 1936, but being half-Jewish, found it difficult to get work. Nevertheless, the specialist art publisher Thieme-Becker continued to commission biographical sketches from him. </p> <p>On November 9 1938, Kristallnacht, he was arrested by the Gestapo, along with his father and brother; his father was imprisoned but the sons, being \"half-Aryan\", were released. Later, he used this \"privilege\" to help other Jews to emigrate, by negotiating on their behalf with the German emigration and tax officials. </p> <p>In May 1939, Hinrichsen asked his English relatives for an invitation, and obtained permission from the German army to go abroad for three months before his call-up came through. When war broke out, he sent a telegram to his parents stating that he had broken a leg and was unable to travel. On the strength of this, the German Red Cross later sent him biscuits in the shape of swastikas, but he was never to live in Germany again. </p> <p>In London, Hinrichsen became part of a theatrical team sent by the Quakers to entertain East End workers in factory canteens. He was also appointed by a Swiss publisher of international medical periodicals to handle their affairs in Britain. On the day before war was declared, he met his future wife, Gretel, then working as a dietician and cook at Hampstead general hospital. </p> <p>But British public opinion was turning against the newly arrived Germans and Austrians, and, under pressure, Churchill ordered the mass internment of some 30,000 refugees. Hinrichsen was interned for 11 months, though he was able to continue his publishing work. Later, this connection proved valuable to the intelligence services, as they were able to obtain, through Hinrichsen, classified technical and medical information which the Germans unsuspectingly supplied to neutral Switzerland. </p> <p>Schwitters was the most avant-garde artistic resident of Hutchinson camp, with his interest in making sculptures out of porridge, his penchant for sleeping under his bed and his love of periodically barking like a dog. This dadaist spirit must have infused the other inmates, who used part of his sound poem Ursonate as a greeting to one another. They also produced their own newspaper, with reviews, news and stories written entirely in English. </p> <p>Following his release, Hinrichsen joined the Home Guard, and, after the war, began a successful career in pharmaceuticals. He established an office in the City of London, becoming a freeman in 1962. He was, for eight years, chairman of the Highgate and Archway Liberal party, and supported the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. </p> <p>He also became the chronicler of art in internment, writing the chapter Visual Arts Behind The Wire for the book The Internment Of Aliens In 20th-Century Britain (edited by David Cesarani and Tony Kushner, 1993). He spoke on numerous radio and television programmes and assisted with exhibitions of internee art. </p> <p>He and Gretel, whom he married in 1942, became great friends with Schwitters's English companion, Edith Thomas. More recently, he supported efforts to save Schwitters's Merzbarn, a collaged environment, in the Lake District, and, at the time of his death, he had just completed a book about internment from a child's view point. </p> <p>Just a few weeks ago, at a conference at Tate Britain, he could be heard giving a hearty rendition of the internment camp's greeting: \"Lanke Trrgl, Lanke Trrgl, Pi, Pi, Pi, Pi, Lanke Trrgl Ooka, Ooka, Zueka, Zueka . . .\" </p> <p>Gretel, and a son and daughter, survive him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Klaus Hinrichsen, art historian and businessman, born April 12 1912; died September 7 2004</p>",
  "<p>Interactive whiteboards have revolutionised learning at West Oaks school and technology college. Students at the special needs and emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) school, on various campuses around Leeds, are benefiting from its use of mainstream learning technology. </p> <p>Software programs combined with whiteboards and digital photography are giving students unprecedented access to the national curriculum. And these adapted resources can be transferred back into mainstream education to help schools help students with similar issues, says Elaine Hampson, the assistant head and ICT curriculum manager at West Oaks. </p> <p>When a whiteboard was installed in teacher Sue Towers' classroom last January, many of her students discovered a new way to express themselves. One such student was seven-year-old Nathan Ullah. Using the whiteboard, he made rapid progress. </p> <p>Towers says: \"Nathan has learning needs associated with autistic spectrum condition. He was fairly solitary and not really interacting with his environment. When we put the interac tive whiteboard in, Nathan's behaviour changed. He went from standing in front of the board dancing, to touching the board and anticipating what comes next. We can now change the objective of an exercise and he follows the course of cause and effect; he's learning. He knows it's got a process.\" </p> <p>Hampson takes mainstream teaching software and adapts it to suit the abilities of each student. Teachers rely heavily on interactive whiteboards, which maintain lesson focus. Using software programs such as Widgit Software's Writing with Symbols (\u00a3400 for 10 user licences), Immersive Education's Kar2ouche programs (from \u00a3219 plus user licences,) and software from Inclusive Technology, Hampson develops projects that focus on whiteboards. The main West Oaks site caters for students between the ages of two-and-a-half and 19 years. This campus has 13 Smartboard interactive whiteboards (\u00a33,500 each). </p> <p>The school also has a mobile Smartboard (\u00a35,700), which is height adjustable - good for young children and students in wheelchairs - and backlit. The school also runs one class within a nearby primary. Twelve West Oaks children between eight and 11 years work at key stage 2 here, and when appropriate, join in with mainstream classes. </p> <p>A few miles away is the Oakwood Lane site for EBD students, which became part of West Oaks two years ago. This campus was a failing school until it came under West Oaks' wing. Now all three classes have interactive whiteboards and every student and teacher has a wireless networked laptop computer. </p> <p>The end goal is to get the students back into mainstream school by slowly integrating them, starting with one morning a week at a mainstream school. Stonegate, a secondary school for EBD students, is under special measures. </p> <p>It was taken over by head of West Oaks, Hillary McEwan, in January. Hampson outlines the school's passion for ICT: \"The most important thing is that ICT enables access to the curriculum for each child. Not many of our children can write as they have severe learning difficulties. Many of our children also have very severe language difficulties; some don't have language at all. </p> <p>But everyone here does the national curriculum, adapted through ICT for their abilities.\" Digital photography and film is crucial for West Oaks. Each class has its own digital camera, which is used to record student progress. The pictures are filed in pupils' records of achievement, displayed around the school and given to parents. </p> <p>Every teacher is able to quickly download pictures and immediately display them on the whiteboard or print them out. </p> <p>\"Our students can't write, but they can take digital pictures and use the whiteboards to put sounds and pictures together. They can access mainstream ICT learning for key stage 3 at their level, key stage 1, with these resources,\" Hampson says. </p> <p>Digital photography is often used in conjunction with the whiteboards. Teachers requested that Hampson create an electronic registration programme. Now, digital pictures of all students in a class are displayed on the interactive whiteboard each morning. The school has also invested in three digital camcorders and a digital video-editing suite. These tools have been invaluable in capturing pupils' achievements, Hampson says. </p> <p>\"A still image shows a snapshot in time, but 20 seconds of a moving image will show a student actually doing something, which allows you to really assess learning because you have visual evidence.\" </p> <p>As a technology college, the school received government money for ICT equipment over a four-year period. However, the vast sums the school has spent have mostly been generated by selling the training, technical and consultative skills of McEwan, Hampson and school systems manager, Ewan Stewart, to other schools. </p> <p>\"We know how much of an impact ICT has had on our kids, so it's value for money. For that, you find the money from somewhere,\" Hampson says.</p>",
  "<p>Where would you go to find cutting-edge education ICT - games, graphics and even holographic virtual reality images that can literally walk off the screen? Hollywood? Pinewood? How about Gateshead? Or, to be more specific, the Gateshead City Learning Centre (CLC). </p> <p>Next to a school and with views across the Tyne and the former Swan Hunter shipyard, this city technology college pilots cutting-edge educational ICT. Working in partnership with local schools, new media companies and the nearby Teesside University virtual reality centre, Gateshead CLC is a modern, purpose-built, high-tech, high-spec incubator with the kind of resources schools can only dream about. </p> <p>It has computer animation suites, graphic modelling and multimedia recording studios. It is funded by a generous single regeneration budget grant and the result is a burgeoning new media industry. Here are some highlights from current trials. </p> <p><strong> A walk through history </strong> </p> <p>A cleverly constructed educational programme using 3D animation and games technology is bringing history to life for year 8 pupils from St Thomas More school in Gateshead. The pilot software takes them on a mission through a virtual 18th-century French town to discover key facts about a moment in history. Ben Ostell from the bottom set is delighted to have found inspiration at last. </p> <p>Working on his own, he breaks off to explain how: \"Last week we were learning all about the storming of the Bastille. This is better than a book, because in a book you can't really tell what's going on - you have to imagine it. Here you can see what's going on and what people really looked like.\" </p> <p>Using the directional arrows on his keypad to control a car toon character - a 21st-century teenager - Ben and his classmates move around the town questioning the people they meet about the causes and effects of the French revolution. There is a priest, a nobleman, peasants and revolutionaries. </p> <p>Besides a spoken answer, clicking on an animation could throw up a hotlink to a piece of original text or source material about the French revolution. Pupils use the information they discover to inspire their writing, answer quizzes or complete multiple-choice exercises. Ben's class are all keen on the pilot material they have been using for two hours a week for the past six weeks. Their comments have been fed back to the software's designer, Chris Brannigan, chief executive of Caspian Learning. </p> <p>The big motivator for the pupils is the competitive nature of the game. Not only can they move around the virtual world, learning at their own pace, but they can get instant feedback from quizzes and the chance to go back and improve on their results. The program even prompts pupils by pinpointing the areas they need to brush up on. </p> <p>Pupil Rebecca Macaleese sees the educational program as an interactive, animated book. \"No, it's not really a game. You put questions to the characters you meet from a menu of choices. They're good questions; they make sense to me. They are the sort of things I would have asked. It makes learning more fun.\" </p> <p>Jessica Smith and Ruth Gordon are doing the exercises together. \"It motivates you because you learn in a different way,\" says Ruth. \"The scores I get now are much higher than when I first started.\" </p> <p>History teacher Craig Jones is delighted at the progress his bottom set has made and he is impressed by the similar uplift experienced by high achievers in the top set. \"The software is all about differentiation by outcomes,\" he says. \"As pupils progress, the tasks get harder. The top set moves further and learns more.\" </p> <p>Most importantly, the low achievers are hooked and motivated by their success. As they improve and are given time, some might even catch up with the top set. The game has fitted in well with the year 8 curriculum. </p> <p>\"We teach the Tudors and the English civil war, and there are sites and historic buildings we can take children to,\" says Jones. </p> <p>\"But the French revolution is much more distant and the only resources we have are textbooks and a video of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities.\" Brannigan plans to develop games-based educational software to cover major topics across the entire curriculum. New titles in development include volcanoes, government and democracy, world religions, maths and literacy across the ability range. </p> <p>He is refining his French revolution program with the St Thomas More pupils before launching the product, so what we are seeing here is a first glimpse of things to come. The hardest part was the two years' development he undertook with a group of fellow PhD students at St Andrews University to design a games engine adapted to a wide variety of learning styles and subject content. Incredibly, his inspiration came from a failed e-learning initiative by the US military. </p> <p>\"The American army had spent $5m trying to develop games-based e-learning that could be used with a Sony Playstation,\" he says. \"But they started from the wrong angle - technology. We approached the project from the user's perspective, asking how people process learning.\"</p> <p> The French revolution game gives users ample opportunity to consolidate their knowledge. As soon as information is introduced it is followed up with simple memory tasks such as quizzes. Further into the \"game\", pupils progress to more sophisticated information handling. Building knowledge incrementally boosts pupils' test results and written work as well as their confidence. Children learn best when engaged fully with the subject matter. In the case of the French revolution game, history is presented in the form of a vivid, first-hand account. Gateshead has been very quick to spot the educational potential of the educational games technology being piloted and Caspian Learning has sold a licence to Gateshead LEA for all its schools. \"We're going to roll out 10 modules in 90 schools - half at key stage 2 and half at key stages 3 and 4,\" says Brannigan. </p> <p><strong> 3D space journey</strong> </p> <p>In true horror movie tradition the A-level biology class from St Thomas More's school don bipolar glasses to view some amazing computer-generated 3D images. We are watching the structure of a molecule and the unravelling twin strands of DNA. Pupils are reaching out of their desks convinced the illusion projected from a wall-sized electronic whiteboard can actually be touched. Later they will take a look at blood pumping around the heart. The visuals are being trialled in conjunction with Teesside University's virtual reality centre, a testbed for new technology and new media start-up companies. </p> <p>\"Teachers in the north-east are getting to grips with the potential of high quality 3D,\" says Andy McPherson, manager of Gateshead CLC. </p> <p>\"Visuals like these are a key part of the computer-aided design (Cad) is used by companies such as Jaguar cars to create visual prototypes and by animation companies such as Perfect Storm that produce special effects for the Harry Potter films.\" </p> <p>Unlike holograms (fixed images reproduced by laser light), these virtual reality (VR) images can only be viewed through bipolar glasses. The 3D effect comes from a stereoscopic camera.</p> <p> When looked at through the special glasses the image that has been modelled or photographed appears to have a solid shape but is in fact an optical illusion. The technology is related to that used to create a recent ground-breaking VR image of an Egyptian mummy, produced from enhanced sectional photographs generated by a magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scanner. </p> <p>Nigel Rodwell, technical director of the VR centre, says the technology is useful for showing close-up images of objects too precious to handle or to model the inner workings of the body, for example. It can even be used to take children on journeys into the past where they can walk through computer-generated images of, for example, ancient Rome. Cost is the big issue, says Rodwell. \"Our biggest customers are museums that want us to create 3D images of exhibits that are too valuable to let people touch.\" </p> <p><strong> Kahootz</strong> </p> <p>A year 6 class from Corpus Christi Roman Catholic primary in Bensham, Tynemouth, visits the Gateshead city learning centre one morning a week to prepare for a web link with two schools down under - Marina View primary in Auckland, New Zealand, and Mount Waverley North primary school in Melbourne, Australia. </p> <p>They use Kahootz software to create 3D images of local scenes to post on a password-protected page on the Kahootz website, which will be accessed by the three schools. Exchanging such information-rich files would not normally be possible, given the constraints on schools' bandwidth, but Kahootz uses Xpressions, a program to compress files. </p> <p>Published by the Australian Children's Television Foundation, Kahootz is a set of interactive 3D multimedia tools. It allows users to make their own virtual worlds, combining words and graphics to produce \"living books\". The Gateshead centre is piloting this link with a eight schools in the north-east. </p> <p>Working at PCs in one of the computer suites, this is year 6's third visit to the centre. Their teacher has divided them into groups of three and four to create visualisations of six local landmarks - Tynemouth, Newcastle airport, the city centre, the funfair, St James' Park and the landmark iron statue, the Angel of the North. Under the eye of the school's ICT coordinator, Joanne Phillips, pupils are selecting and downloading Google image files to drag and drop into their computer-generated environment. </p> <p>They also have a menu of options to add figures, animals or cars to the scene, and a set of controls allows them to enlarge, minimise or animate these images. They even have a soundtrack option to add noises when someone clicks on a image. </p> <p>\"This is a low-threshold, high-ceiling activity,\" says Phillips. \"Pupils can get a lot out of it and the more able can learn to animate. Dyslexic children like the visual nature of the tasks; it raises their self-esteem.\" </p> <p>The possibilities of the software can extend the brightest pupils but the automation also allows less motivated pupils to achieve seemingly impressive results with minimal effort. Yianna is clicking on a set of directional arrows to move a computer-generated cartoon figure around a 3D street scene. </p> <p>Kahootz has been used to great effect in reception year classes - getting a figure to move is an absorbing task for younger children who are learning coordination. For use with older children in year 6, say, teacher intervention is needed to avoid pupils clicking aimlessly. </p> <p>One group of high-ability pupils has built a working 3D model of an airport, and Kiah and Jack are examining their world by turning the vision through 360 degrees. </p> <p>\"We've got planes landing and taking off,\" says Kiah. \"We're trying to show what an airport is really like.\" </p> <p>Their teacher comments: \"This group is setting a challenge for the Australian pupils by hiding objects or clues in the virtual world for them to find.\" </p> <p>Overall, Phillips is pleased with the results. \"This hits 60% of our ICT key stage 2 targets. We're finding out information and processing that information. The pupils print out their work and we pin it up for everyone to see and comment on it.\" </p> <p>Peter Stevenson, Gateshead CLC's training and development manager, points out that this is just a beginning. \"We see Kahootz as a link into more complicated exercises such as video editing. To introduce primary schools to the idea of 3D worlds is perfect for that.\" </p> <p>Kahootz publisher Peter Maggs adds: \"All kids need is five or 10 minutes of preparation, experimenting and using their innate creativity. If anything, the challenge is to get the teachers up to the same level.\"</p>",
  "<p>Stir a little imagination in with ICT and you can do without expensive, state-of-the-art technology. For some children, their schooldays can be transformed by the relative simplicity of a fart machine, a talking photo album or the visualisation on Windows Media Player software. </p> <p>We are at Woodlawn school, North Tyneside, which caters for just over 80 pupils with a range of physical, medical or sensory difficulties. When you can't speak, communication technology has the power to transform your life.</p> <p> A group of teenagers is sitting around telling jokes, making excuses, sharing snippets of holiday information and gossiping about the weekend. Nothing unusual in that, apart from the fact that they weren't using their voices but hands, heads and feet - whatever worked best. </p> <p>For Sarah, it was definitely her feet. She's so confident about her toe control and speed at using her Voca (voice output communication aid), that she recently challenged Newcastle United's Peter Beardsley to see if his footwork was faster than hers. He had no chance. </p> <p>Val Brown, the school's deputy head and ICT coordinator is also a great fan of cheaper, less sophisticated communication tools from places like the Gadget Shop. </p> <p>\"One real success has been the talking photo album. This wallet of plastic pockets has pages with space for a recordable message. Coupled with a digital camera, it's a powerful way of linking home and school for children who would not be able to tell others about their day. Parents and teachers take pictures and record messages to create a diary that can be shared,\" he says. </p> <p>The fart machine is another favourite. \"When a child can't take their Voca into the playground, they might take the fart machine instead. It's a way of making your presence felt and getting a laugh from others - not always easy when you have no speech and are strapped in a wheelchair.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, Woodlawn was one of the winners of this year's Learning Environment awards for schools, sponsored by the computer systems supplier Ramesys. </p> <p>The overall winner was Holy Cross boys' school in Belfast, a name that may sound familiar because its sister school, Holy Cross Girls, was in the news when Catholic pupils had to be given a riot police escort to school along a contested stretch of road.</p> <p> According to visiting awards judge Steve Smith, from Ramesys, it was \"an island of calm but exciting learning in truly difficult circumstances\". </p> <p>However, the head made it clear he wasn't seeking conces sions or offering excuses - just looking for excellence. \"I dropped in on eight different classrooms, each filled with children excited and engaged by what they were doing,\" says Smith. </p> <p>\"ICT use was a normal part of every lesson. There was videoconferencing, voting with handsets linked to whiteboards, video-editing, creating animations and all the more usual things like using the web and different applications. </p> <p>\"At Holy Cross, engagement reaches beyond the pupils to parents, many of whom come in to learn alongside their children and end up gaining ICT and other qualifications which subsequently help them find work. </p> <p>\"What struck me, not just in this school but in several, was how essential leadership support is. In many cases it's one gifted teacher who starts off this inspirational use of ICT. If they don't get management support, it stays as something one class or one subject group benefit from. </p> <p>\"At Holy Cross, the head, Terry Laverty, backed the use of ICT completely. Teachers willing to experiment need more support than those who do things as they always have. It takes faith and tenacity to try something new and different so you need the management to back you.\"</p> <p> One of the school's gifted experimenters is Colin Richardson. The children in his class were bubbling over as they described what they had been doing. </p> <p>\"Some people think it's play,\" one pupil explains, \"but it's not, we're learning in a different way.\" For Richardson, interactive whiteboards are a classroom essential. </p> <p>\"I asked for one when I came to the school, now every class has one and embedding use of ICT is in the school development plan. If I went for another job, the first thing I'd check is that I'd have a board,\" he says. </p> <p>He was the deserving winner of the Transforming Teaching and Learning section, making extraordinary use of the ordinary. Video clips from Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith's cookery programmes were used to teach imperative verbs then pupils emailed and phoned children in partner schools with recipe instructions, which fitted in with the history lessons on Victorians and Peppermint Creams. </p> <p>It was possible to tell how well all that had worked because Richardson videoed the children doing it. Art and music were given a fresh approach through using the visualisations on Media Player with pupils, then creating their own artwork in response to different music. Richardson even made use of the talents of an artistic friend, persuading her to scan in some of the world's best paintings to create a virtual gallery using PowerPoint and then videoing her explanations of what they were all about. </p> <p> And what better way to demonstrate the importance of creating a storyboard than using the director's cut section from the popular Monsters Inc DVD, where they discuss just that? Further information on the awards can be found online at: <a href=\"http://www.ramesys.com/LearningEnvironmentAwards\">www.ramesys.com/LearningEnvironmentAwards</a>. </p> <p>Next year, Ramesys will be the lead sponsor of Becta's ICT in Practice Awards, which will include the collaboration category from the Learning Environment Awards as a new section for the first time. </p>"
