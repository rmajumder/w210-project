  "<p>A great deal has changed in Katowice since Sir Alf Ramsey brought his team here in 1973, attempting to qualify for the following year's World Cup. There are fewer coal mines and many more clothes shops, the great dark 19th-century Catholic church has been carefully restored and Matt Damon is battling Russian oligarchs in The Bourne Supremacy at a brand-new multiplex. What has not changed is the crucial nature of a football match between Poland and England. </p> <p> Defeat in Silesia hastened the end of Ramsey's tenure as England's manager and after Saturday's unhappy draw in Vienna there are plenty of people who think that Sven-Goran Eriksson is only 90 profitless minutes away from a similar fate. Were that to happen in the aftermath of tonight's Group Six qualifying match, it would be a new experience for the 56-year-old Swede. </p> <p> \"I've been a manager for many years and I've never been sacked,\" he said here yesterday, \"so I don't know the feeling. The longer you stay in the job, the bigger the possibility is, of course. But once again I'm absolutely not thinking about it, I'm not worried about it, because what I'm thinking about is the Poland game, about trying to win and trying to play good football.\" </p> <p> Before his squad left Vienna on Monday, Eriksson called a meeting and took them through the 2-2 draw with Austria. His basic diagnosis - highly disputed, it must be said - remains that England played \"good football\" for an hour before letting a two-goal lead slip away in a 15-minute period of all-round shoddiness. </p> <p> \"I showed the players a video of the most important moments of the game,\" he said, \"and I talked about attacking and defending. During moments in the second half we didn't attack well and we didn't defend well.\" </p> <p> Perhaps realising that plenty of people not earning \u00a33.5m a year would have been capable of so superficial an analysis, he became marginally more specific after being told that Steven Gerrard had claimed the players became \"nervous\" during the second half. </p> <p> \"I haven't talked to Steven about that,\" he said, \"but my opinion is that they didn't become nervous. Fifteen or 20 minutes into the second half we stopped taking our positions, we started to run with the ball a little bit, we lost the ball and we gave them chances to make counter-attacks, which never happened during the first 45 minutes, when we had a huge amount of possession. But we stopped doing things simply. We made football complicated. And when we forgot to do the simple things, they scored twice.\" </p> <p> The man who forgot the simplest thing of all was David James, who allowed a deflected long-range shot to pass under his body. After the match Eriksson stated unequivocally that James would play tonight. When asked yesterday if this would be the most important game of the goalkeeper's career, his defence was a little more muted. </p> <p> \"When we make mistakes in football,\" he said, \"we're criticised. I always say, fair enough. And especially after a game we should have won, of course we're criticised. So the next game is important for all of us.\" </p> <p> The inclusion in tonight's team of David Beckham will be determined solely on the grounds of fitness, following his treatment for a bruised rib. The object of much criticism after Saturday's match, the captain retains his manager's support and took part in the full squad training session yesterday. </p> <p> \"I haven't considered dropping him and I can't agree that he played badly,\" Eriksson said. \"I don't know how many times he switched play from right to left, which was always important for us. I agree that he can play better. But to drop him because he's not playing well, I don't agree with that.\" </p> <p> Eriksson also responded to the accusation that he shows too much loyalty to his star players in general, regardless of current form. \"To be loyal to your football players, why shouldn't you do that? If I think some of the players should be dropped, I drop them. And if I don't drop them, it's because I don't think they should be dropped. That's my opinion. I don't say it's the right opinion. But in the job I have, I have to take decisions on evidence.\" </p> <p> Had his players held on to their lead in Vienna, a draw tonight might have seemed a satisfactory result. After the disappointment of Saturday, however, the pressure is on for England to take all three points and reassert their status as the group's clear favourites. </p> <p> \"After one draw it would be better to win tonight,\" Eriksson said, \"but there are a lot of games to play still and I'm not agreeing with those who are trying to panic after one game. I'm sure we'll qualify for Germany. The will to do that in the squad is great. Are they panicking? Absolutely not. They're calm and confident, very solid, very optimistic. It's good that England always expect us to win but life out there on the pitch for 90 minutes is not always that easy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Regus, the loss-making office-space provider, said it had cut costs by 18%, withdrawing from sites in France, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands as part of its efforts to return to profitability. </p> <p>The group, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States last year, said losses for the first half of 2004 narrowed from \u00a328.2m to \u00a33.1m, helped by \u00a3108m in savings. </p> <p>\"We remain vigilant and will continue to review each lease that comes up for renewal,\" the company said in a statement to the stock exchange. \"We will also continue to rationalise where appropriate.\" </p> <p>Among other cost-saving measures introduced were a wave of middle-management job cuts and a more efficient computerised management of sales and services. </p> <p>Turnover declined to \u00a3125m from \u00a3129m, reflecting a 14% decline in the average number of available workstations as well as a weakening dollar. </p> <p>Occupancy levels rose 14% without Regus resorting to deeply discounted offers, as it has done in the past. John Matthews, the chairman, said: \"We have built a record forward order book and have seen a substantial rise in enquiries as well as a reduction in discounting for new sales.\" Revenue per available workstation - a benchmark for Regus - grew by 12%, helped by increases in occupancy, price and services. New sale and renewal prices grew 14% and the group said it had already taken bookings expected to be worth \u00a395m over the next 12 months. </p> <p>Regus completed its acquisition last month of US rival HQ Global Holdings for $300m (\u00a3169m), increasing its presence to about 650 office-block centres in 240 cities worldwide. The acquisition is expected to deliver synergies of at least $20m a year. </p> <p>Regus, which was founded by the chief executive, Mark Dixon, 15 years ago, was released from Chapter 11 last year after agreeing to issue 70m shares to scores of American landlords in exchange for the cancellation of outstanding rent claims. </p> <p>Two years ago the group had been forced to sell a controlling stake in its British business to private equity group Alchemy Partners. </p> <p>Mr Dixon, a former hot-dog seller, still owns 46% of the business. It came close to collapse during the economic slowdown of 2001, when prices for office space fell sharply as businesses cut back on spending. Regus had over-expanded during the technology boom.</p>",

  "<p>University may be many things, but it's not cheap. A recent survey by the Royal Bank of Scotland put average student living costs in Britain at \u00a3121.40 a week. Once accommodation costs are added it's closer to \u00a3190. And whether it is generous parents or a big overdraft, someone has to pick up the tab.</p> <p>Increasingly, students themselves are taking on this burden while still at university. Numbers going to university have grown, yet grants have shrunk, and with the introduction of tuition fees, many students now work to help finance their studies. </p> <p>According to the RBS survey, 40% of students now have part-time jobs, but other studies put this figure as high as 60%. In the holidays, it goes up to 90%.</p> <p>\"Increasingly students have no choice; they have to get out and work,\" says Jamie Medhurst, director of student welfare (and film and television lecturer) in the Theatre, Films and Television Department of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Of the 1,000 students in his department he reckons the \"vast majority\" work during term time.</p> <p>On the bright side, it's relatively easy to find a job. In addition to local temporary employment agencies, almost every university in Britain has a student employment service or \"job shop\" that can help students find appropriate work. Most of these operate along the lines of job centres and generally are run by universities' career services or the student union. And, according to Alison Clark at the National Association of Student Employment Services (NASES), there is no shortage of work; one of the job shops on her association's books advertised more than 8,000 jobs last year. \"If you want work you'll get it,\" she says.</p> <p>Most of the available jobs are for casual workers. Bar and restaurant positions were the most popular in the RBS survey, followed by retail. Pay is likely to be a little above minimum wage (increasing to \u00a34.10 an hour for 18-21 year olds and \u00a34.85 for others at the beginning of October). At the University of Liverpool, for instance, where Paul Cullinan is a student employment manager, the average is \u00a35.14 an hour. </p> <p>For students working 15 hours a week (about average), this generates an income of around \u00a32,300 during the 30 weeks of term - not enough to pay your own way, but enough \"to go a long way towards reducing your debt\", says Mr Cullinan. He also reckons that students can probably hope to earn the same again if they are prepared to work full-time in the summer holidays. </p> <p>And, by and large, students get to keep most of this money. If you earn below \u00a34,615 a year, you won't pay tax, above that it's only charged at 10% until you earn \u00a36,535. Unfortunately though, if you earn more than \u00a391 a week, you'll automatically be charged national insurance. In fact, tax will also be deducted from your pay slip above this amount, but you can claim it back fairly easily. Students working only during the holidays, meanwhile, can ask their employers for a P38 form to prevent tax being taken off.</p> <p>But getting a job and earning the money is the easy part. Combining the hard graft involved with full-time study may prove more challenging.</p> <p>It's a problem that Mr Medhurst is all too familiar with at Aberystwyth. \"On the one hand students say they have to work to survive, but on the other they have to study and attend classes. It's a difficult balance,\" he says. This can particularly be a problem for those taking on bar work that finishes late: \"Standing at the front of the lecture hall teaching you can sometimes see them dropping off.\"</p> <p>It's a difficulty that many universities recognise. Most job shops set a limit on the amount of hours they encourage students to work (usually around 15), and at both Oxford and Cambridge, where students face intensive eight-week terms, working in term time is discouraged. \"Term is quite tightly packed here, and it's really asking too much for people to do work on top of their studies,\" explains Ray Jobling, secretary of the standing tutors' committee at Cambridge.</p> <p>But it is not just a question of the number of hours your course demands; timetables play a big part. </p> <p>Mandy Buddle, a mature student, is about to start her third year doing deaf studies at Bristol University. As a qualified social worker, she could have taken a part-time job for the local council during term, but decided this would be too much of a commitment to combine with her studies. Instead she found a job in her first year cleaning rooms for a local hotel chain during the two days a week that she had no lectures. </p> <p>In the second year, however, timetable changes made things a lot more difficult: \"I was doing about the same hours of lectures but they were distributed differently. The hotel was really flexible but I didn't have the free days and I found it really exhausting to do the work and then have to go off and do lectures.\" For her final year she will rely on money earned working full-time as a social worker during the holidays and part-time at a residential care home at the weekends. </p> <p>Nevertheless, if students are able to fit it in with their studies, working may have longer-term advantages. \"Even if the work is completely unrelated to your course, it's still valuable experience,\" says Cullinan. \"Employers are going to be looking at these kinds of jobs on your CV when you go through the graduate recruitment process.\"</p> <p>For some students it can make all the difference. Margot Parker graduated this summer from City University in London, where she read business studies. While there, she took a job working around 20 hours a week in a local bar and after a few months, became a supervisor. </p> <p>She feels the experience proved invaluable when applying to the graduate training scheme of a major national retailer after university. \"That was critical to getting the job,\" she says. \"Even if it was just bar work, it showed that someone had trusted me with money, managing people and representing the organisation.\" </p> <p>For some, this might be the most compelling reason of all to find work. With more students than ever going to university, competition for jobs afterwards is fierce. According to a recent study by researchers at Cardiff University, recruiters receive an average of 20 applications for any one post. In this environment, the work you take just for the money while at university may prove to be one of the best investments you ever make. </p>",
  "An east London office in the 1960s. It is just after 9am. As a team of white education bureaucrats prepare for their day of calls and paperwork, they realise that a Jamaican woman, in her best coat and hat and surrounded by three children, has quietly colonised one corner of the room. She has reading material, food and a Thermos flask. <p>She has clearly planned for a lengthy stay. She tells them she has come to see the director of education, and though for a while she becomes an object of mirth, they realise four hours later, once she has served lunch for the children and settled down for the afternoon, that she is serious. </p> <p>Two hours later, when the director of education finally appears, the woman is gracious as she tells him that his officials seem loth to let her daughter go to the best local school even though she has the grades to do so. He promises to investigate and she leaves, but not before she has asserted her right to resurrect the protest if the matter is not resolved. </p> <p>There was, in the event, no need. The director intervened and the allocation was changed. The girl thrived, did well in her A-levels and is now that uncommon species: a black teacher. Neither my late mother - who staged the sit-in - or my sister, the beneficiary, would have imagined that their small battle with the authorities would have any resonance 40 years later. </p> <p>But with the release today of a new report into the underachievement of black pupils in the British school system, it is clear that the need for black parents to take a protective stance towards their children is, if anything, more urgent today than it was then. Too often, we are pushing them into a system that should prepare them for life in our fast-moving global economies only to see them emerge mangled at the other end. </p> <p>Horror stories are popular and devotees of the genre can do no better than turn to an examination by the London Development Agency's education commission into the scandal. Using data from 2002-03, it shows that after a bright start at primary school, the fortunes of black boys nosedive from year two. </p> <p>They gain fewer qualifications than their white counterparts. They fare less well than other minorities. In London, black boys who could be categorised as middle class do less well than boys from other minorities who are working class. They are excluded from school at a rate three times higher than white pupils. They tell of teachers who victimise and stereotype them and damn them with the crippling weight of low expectations. Well they would say that, wouldn't they? </p> <p>But they are supported by black parents who tell how they are shunned and belittled by the school authorities; and by black teachers who complain of an institutional racism which means they rarely progress as far as their talents might allow. </p> <p>The true horror unfolds when one reads the summary of the different studies that have examined this problem over the past 30 years. In 1971, in his report How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Sub-normal in the British School System, Bernard Coard perceived three issues disabling the black schoolboy. \"Low expectations on his part about his likely performance in a white-controlled system of education. Low motivation to succeed academically because he feels the cards are stacked against him; and low teacher expectations which affect the amount of effort expended on his behalf by the teacher, and also affect his own image of himself and his abilities.\" </p> <p>Coard urged a recruitment drive in order to appoint more African-Caribbean teachers to schools where there are high numbers of African-Caribbean pupils. He said black history and culture should be part of the curriculum for all schools. He called on black parents to create nursery and supplementary schools \"in order to support positive racial identity and self-confidence\". He warned black parents that they must be in regular contact with their children's schools. \"Ask questions and challenge as necessary,\" he said. Plus \u00e7a change. </p> <p>Many things have changed in the interim and too little has been for the better. First-generation West Indians came to Britain without much formal education, but with a clear understanding that successful schooling was essential. They realised that white structures would not, through altruism, do them any favours. </p> <p>But they have been succeeded by a second generation, too many of whom have lost faith in the defining power of education. Some watch as their children drift away from mainstream life and into the alternative - sometimes lucrative - lifestyles of drugs and crime. Others engage in a form of passive parenting, comforted by the illusion that the playing field is level and their boys will get by. It isn't and, as the new report shows, they don't. </p> <p>We hear the continuing debate about what is most to blame for the plight of our black boys. Is it peer pressure, negative influences from music and the media, the fact that 48% of black boys have single-parent households? Do we do it to ourselves? Or is it the authorities, racist schools, culturally illiterate teachers? Do they do it to us? </p> <p>But the point is moot, because either explanation is going to require us to redouble our efforts. If the problem is us, we are going to have to rediscover the self-belief and the coping strategies to guide our children through what is obviously still hostile territory. We are going to have to ask more of them and ourselves. In many communities, with their mentoring schemes and supplementary schools, that process has begun. </p> <p>But the report makes it clear that it will also fall to us to challenge this record of municipal failure and to make that territory less hostile. That means using what clout and knowledge we have to gain more black teachers, headteachers, governors and councillors, to pressure our councils and MPs. </p> <p>Community leaders must play their part, but this will stand or fall on the efforts of ordinary parents who stand up for their children: ladies who doorstep bureaucrats and refuse to go away. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hugh Muir writes for the Guardian on London issues and is a school governor </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:hugh.muir@theguardian.com\">hugh.muir@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The \"McLibel two\" today began the latest phase of their long-running legal struggle at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. <p>Helen Steel, 39, and 50-year-old David Morris contended that their 1997 defeat by the fast food giant McDonalds at the libel courts had followed a \"patently unfair\" fight.</p> <p>The two claimed that their original high court trial - at which they were ordered to pay McDonald's \u00a360,000 in damages - had breached their rights to a fair trial and freedom of expression under human rights laws.</p> <p>Keir Starmer QC told the judges there had been a \"vast inequality of arms\" at the original court battle between Ms Steel and Mr Morris, who represented themselves, and the team of lawyers at the disposal of a major corporation.</p> <p>\"This case is about the rights of two ordinary people, without power or wealth, to engage in a public campaign on matters of public interest and importance,\" he today told the judges. </p> <p>However, a government lawyer, Philip Sales, denied the government had been in any breach of the human rights convention, and defended decisions not to award the pair any legal aid. McDonald's was not involved in today's hearing, saying in a statement that it was a matter for \"UK government, and not McDonald's\".</p> <p>Ms Steel and Mr Morris began campaigning against McDonalds during the mid 80s, attracting a libel writ from the fast food firm in 1990 after dispensing, but not writing, leaflets criticising it. Despite their high court defeat, which came after an English legal record 314 days in court, the judges ruled that part of the leaflet was correct. </p> <p>They said it told the truth when it accused McDonald's of paying low wages, being responsible for cruelty to some of the animals used in its products, and exploiting children in advertising campaigns.</p> <p>\"Although the so-called McLibel case came to court in 1994, the allegations related to practices in the 80s,\" McDonald's said in a statement today. \"The world has moved on since then, and so has McDonald's.\"</p> <p>So far, Ms Steel and Mr Norris have paid none of the damages, which were reduced to \u00a340,000 on appeal. In 2000, they launched a bid for the case to be heard at the European court of human rights.</p> <p>During today's hearing, which lasted for just over two hours, Mr Starmer told the court that, when the McLibel trial began, there were around 11,800 McDonald's restaurants in 53 countries, with total sales valued at around $18.75bn (\u00a310.2bn). </p> <p>\"By way of contrast, during the same period, Helen Steel's maximum income was \u00a365 a week when she was employed as a part-time bar worker,\" he said. \"David Morris, a single parent, was unwaged, and entirely dependent on income support.\"</p> <p>Legal aid for the pair had been refused, and they lacked legal resources or experience with no legal training of any kind, he said. </p> <p>Domestic law on defamation was also weighted heavily against the defendants, the court was told. Not only had they lacked financial support, they also - under English libel law - had to establish the exact truth of every statement contained in the leaflet. </p> <p>Mr Starmer said this differed from libel law elsewhere, in which the onus was on the accused to prove statements were inaccurate. </p> <p>\"For the duration of the trial, all the applicants could hope to do was to keep going,\" Mr Starmer said. \"On several occasions, they had to seek adjournments because of their physical exhaustion and, when Helen Steel was certified as suffering from stress and exhaustion by her doctor, the trial continued in her absence. </p> <p>\"The result was that, without legal assistance, the case was underprepared, unready for trial and was advanced by two inexperienced, untrained and exhausted individuals who were pushed to their physical and mental limits. In short, it was patently unfair.\" </p> <p>However Mr Sales told the judges that the fact Ms Steel and Mr Morris had ultimately lost their libel battle was not evidence that they had been let down by English libel laws. </p> <p>He claimed that the fact the trial had lasted so long and had gone into such detail demonstrated they had the fullest access to the domestic courts in England. </p> <p>\"They were given every possible latitude in the presentation of their case,\" he said. \"Indeed, the trial judge went out of his way to a quite extraordinary degree. It is clear the applicants had a fully effective opportunity to present their case.\" </p> <p>He said the government had to consider how to use limited funding in assisting legal proceedings.</p> <p>Afterwards, Mr Morris said he was satisfied with the hearing, claiming the government had been forced on the defensive by acknowledging that legal aid for libel cases could be made available in exceptional circumstances in the future. \"We will continue our fight because the environment and the planet is in a mess,\" he said. </p> <p>The judges adjourned the case, and were expected to deliver a verdict either later this year or early next year. </p> <p>Whatever the judges rule, the European court cannot overturn any rulings by the UK courts, but can only declare that the complainants' rights were infringed.</p> <p>However, it can award damages - usually small - for any infringement, and the government would then have an obligation to reform whatever aspect of the law had infringed their rights.</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturing output unexpectedly dropped for the second month running in July, figures showed today.</p> <p>The data, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reinforced impressions that interest rates were either at or close to their peak. </p> <p>The ONS said manufacturing output had fallen by 0.2%, defying expectations of a 0.5% rise. This followed a 0.7% decline in June, and was the first consecutive fall since October 2002. It brought the annual rate down to just 0.9%.</p> <p>Analysts said today's data would raise concern that the manufacturing sector's recovery was coming under increasing pressure from high interest rates and strong oil prices.</p> <p>\"The softness of manufacturing output in July makes it even more of a cast iron certainty that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged on Thursday,\" Howard Archer, of Global Insight, said. </p> <p>\"However, this was already a done deal, given the current growing evidence of a slowdown in the housing market and at least temporary moderation in consumer spending.\"</p> <p>Economists are unanimously agreed that the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) will leave rates at 4.75% when it meets later this week. </p> <p>The MPC has raised borrowing costs five times since last November, with the moves coming amid concern that the housing market and consumer spending were rising at unsustainable levels. </p> <p>Analysts had been predicting that rates would hit a peak of 5.5% early next year, but now believe there will be little further increase - if any at all - this year.</p> <p>An 11.1% drop in beer production and an 8.3% drop in pharmaceutical output accounted for most of the decline in July's manufacturing output, with the ONS saying the drop in beer output was probably the result of a sharp rise in production having taken place during the Euro 2004 football tournament in June.</p> <p>It was also the largest month on month drop for almost a decade, but manufacturing was weak across the board, with output falling in eight of the 13 sub-sectors.</p> <p>Overall industrial production also declined unexpectedly, by 0.3%, bringing the annual rate to 0.1%. However, the ONS also revised earlier data, with industrial production in the second quarter of 2004 now estimated to have grown by 1.2% instead of 0.9%. \"The upshot of today's figures is that the industrial recovery is looking more vulnerable that it has for some time, and that industry is going to contribute less to GDP growth in the third quarter than in the second,\" Jonathan Loynes, an economist with Capital Economics, said. </p> <p>\"Even so, this is unlikely to affect this week's MPC decision - we're going for no change - but it is a warning that industry may not be able to fill a hole left by the housing slowdown.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sarah Owen</strong>, teacher, London<br></p> <p>The first half-term of the year is when we get the most work done. Everyone's got bored with the holidays and they're ready to come back. That's really positive. The year 9 boys, in particular, have had little focus since their Sats in May and get quite disaffected. Then they come back in year 10, into new groups depending on their results, and they feel they've really got somewhere and are very motivated. The newness and excitement is quite tangible. We do the most difficult pieces of coursework then; we have five pieces of coursework and 98% of the first one gets handed in.</p> <p>Another good thing is that the year 9s are really keen to do well in their Sats and so last year we started preparation earlier to take advantage - and they got the best results our college has ever had. I also like having a nice clean classroom to start up in; I clear out my drawers and get my filing done before everything gets going at 100 miles an hour. And I just love unpacking my stationery order, brand new files and folders and Tipp-Ex - all that nice new stock is wonderful.</p> <p><strong>Tracey McDonald</strong> parent, Hampshire<br></p> <p>My daughter is going into her first year of secondary school and I think that will be great for her. Her primary school is lovely, but she's ready to move on now and really get her teeth into some grown-up schoolwork, languages and science. I know it will be a bit of a culture shock for all of us the first few weeks, but she'll really enjoy it once she settles in. She's a bit nervous, but more excited and looking forward to it than worried.</p> <p>We've already had fun buying her uniform and all her new kit, including grown-up things like a new calculator and a science overall. We've looked round the new school a couple of times and we all think it looks very exciting. We're planning a couple of dry runs on the journey so she knows where to get the bus, but she is determined to do it on her own, and that kind of independence is the kind of quantum leap she'll be making from the new environment.</p> <p><strong>Ben Clark</strong> 14, Somerset<br></p> <p>Seeing my friends will be the best thing. I have seen some of them over the holidays but it's not the same as seeing them every day. I don't mind getting back into the classroom. I like French and German best and I feel as though I've forgotten everything we did last year because I haven't had any practice. We went to France for a fortnight and that helped, but I haven't done any German at all. But the best thing will be getting back into sport, rugby and football. We do extra rugby training after school once a week and that's the best part of the whole school week, except when it rains.</p>",

  "The world's newest parliament building opened today, 10 times over budget and more than three years late, as Scotland's politicians filed into work at Holyrood for the first time. <p>The Scottish first minister, Jack McConnell, shied away from any razzmatazz, telling reporters: \"It's what we do in the building that really matters.\"</p> <p>The Queen will officially open the building next month - a ceremony the republican Scottish Socialist party and the Greens in the parliament have vowed to boycott.</p> <p>Until now, the parliament's 129 members (MSPs) have squatted temporarily in Church of Scotland premises up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.</p> <p>The new building was principally the brainchild of the late first minister, Donald Dewar, and the Spanish architect Enric Miralles, who also died before the project could be completed.</p> <p>As he prepared to spell out the first legislative programme to have been unveiled in the building, Mr McConnell, the third Scottish first minister in five years, described the building as \"stunning\".</p> <p>\"Built, I know, from controversy and argument, it has also been built to capture the promise of devolution and challenge all of us to meet that promise,\" Mr McConnell said. </p> <p>\"This building is a testament to those who worked long and hard to win devolution - generation after generation for whom this was the dream that made long nights and dark days worth it.\" </p> <p>\"But for the people of Scotland, it's not this building that really matters. It's what we do in this building that really matters.\" </p> <p>McConnell is set to outline 12 bills at Holyrood, including a crackdown on paedophiles who use the internet to groom young victims. The new law is expected to bring in jail terms of up to 10 years for those convicted. </p> <p>Reform of licensing law is also expected, although the decision on a smoking ban in pubs and restaurants will come later.</p> <p>Bills looking at changes on budget, health, housing, higher education, environmental, charity law, female genital mutilation and Gaelic issues are also expected.</p> <p>Other plans will cover the reform of Scots law, the creation of a Scottish transport authority, and education. Another five bills left over from the last session of parliament will continue their progress.</p> <p>MSPs took their places in the debating chamber before the presiding officer, George Reid, opened the new session at 9.30am.</p> <p>The Reverend Charles Robertson, minister at the nearby Canongate Kirk, then led MSPs in reflection.</p> <p>Mr Reid called for an end to the pessimism which has cast a shadow over devolution's early years. \"We must not now go back to the old Caledonian culture which simply reinforces doubt. </p> <p>\"We must look to the future, look over the horizon, think out of the box, raise our game and set about what the parliament is really for. </p> <p>\"That is making a difference to people's daily lives in Scotland, it's about building a Scotland that's enterprising and compassionate, about a confident Scotland at home and a Scotland at ease in the global economy.\" </p> <p>Lord Fraser's Holyrood inquiry report, due next week, could bring \"closure\" to the controversy over the \"massive failure of public procurement\", he added. </p> <p>The deputy first minister and Scottish Lib Dem leader, Jim Wallace, praised the new building, but said devolution was \"not about bricks and mortar\". </p> <p>He said: \"The challenge we face as MSPs is not just to live up to our surroundings, but to live up to the hopes and aspirations of the people of Scotland.\" </p> <p>The SNP deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, commented: \"The new building should be a motivation to MSPs from all parties to raise the quality of debate and focus on the issues that really matter,\" while Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie said the move offered \"the perfect opportunity for a change of approach\" to public service reform. </p> <p>Green group leader Robin Harper added: \"I believe those who aren't already ecstatic about the new parliament will learn to love it and realise it's not just for MSPs, but for all who visit it and work in it, for democracy, and ultimately for Scotland's people.\" </p> <p>The Scottish Socialist leader, Tommy Sheridan, said: \"If we are going to prove ourselves fit to sit in such an austere building then tackling poverty and inequality must be our number one priority.\" </p> <p>The UK government's 1997 white paper on devolution estimated that a new parliament building would cost between \u00a310m and \u00a340m. </p> <p>The 129 MSPs, who have had devolved law-making powers in areas such as health, education and justice policy since 1999, were originally due to move into their permanent home by summer 2001. </p> <p>The Queen will officially open the new parliament building on October 9.</p>",
  "The Mayor of London is to give free travel passes worth almost \u00a3400,000 to participants in a major international \"global justice\" conference in the capital next month. <p>Up to 20,000 delegates attending the European Social Forum will receive three days' free travel on all buses, trains and tubes in zones 1-6. </p> <p>Donating the passes will cost the city a fraction of the headline figure, as no extra services will be laid on. </p> <p>Ken Livingstone's opponents may still seek to make political capital out of the decision, coming as it does within days of his announcement that bus and tube fares will rise next year. </p> <p>But the mayor's office yesterday stressed that the two issues were entirely unrelated. </p> <p>Redmond O'Neill, one of Mr Livingstone's advisers, said the fare increases resulted from years of under-investment in the capital's transport system. </p> <p>He added: \"The face value [of passes] to delegates, up to \u00a319.20, is not reflected in a cost to Transport for London because we're not putting on extra trains or buses. There will be some cost in relation to the train operating companies, but this will be in the low tens of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>\"It's a long-term investment. We want to make London a centre of international discussion and we want young people to come to London and enjoy it. </p> <p>\"One of the biggest problems with holding a major international conference here, particularly when you are dealing with young people, is that the costs of accommodation and transport in London are among the highest in the world. A lot of people simply will not be able to come if we don't find ways to reduce their costs.\" </p> <p>Transport for London has to pay train operating companies to give out the free passes. </p> <p>The mayor has already pledged around \u00a3400,000 for the ESF, but the money comes from existing budgets as the conference covers issues which are GLA priorities, such as protecting the environment and human rights. </p> <p>A spokesman for the event, which has previously been held in Florence and Paris, said organisers welcomed Mr Livingstone's decision. </p> <p>He added: \"The ESF is a unique opportunity for peoples from around the world to meet and discuss many of the critical issues the world faces today.</p> <p>\"That they will come to one of the world's leading capital cities is a fantastic promotion for London and its vibrant multicultural residents, as well as an opportunity for many of London's hotels, restaurants and bars to receive a boost in their customer numbers.\"</p> <p>Organisations ranging from trade unions and churches to environmental charities and groups supporting refugees will take part in the four-day event, starting on October 14.</p>",
  "<b>Rachel Valladores, Democrats Abroad</b> <br> The campaign's not dead yet, folks. I know the media is going on and on in this campaign because of the polling right now which has Bush ahead by about 10 points. [But] we are not lying down and dying yet - far from it, actually. <p>I was on the BBC World Service this morning with John Zogby, who is one of the great American pollsters, and John's point of view on it is that this bounce is a temporary thing - this is the convention bounce, and there's still going to be one heck of a pitched battle. </p> <p>To me that was pretty obvious when I read in the Washington Post this morning that we had changed the entirety of the campaign staff around. Clinton decided to tell Kerry what to do about his staff, and ... they've moved John Sasso out of the Democratic National Committee and put him on the aeroplane, which means things are going to work very differently now. </p> <p>The mood of this campaign is really going to be markedly different. Reorganisation is a normal thing at this point in the campaign because we are changing phases, which means different stage management, different directions, and that's a good thing. It's going to be a meaner and leaner campaign. We have already seen that our hope is still the great message of this campaign - that was the message that came out of the convention. We spent a lot of time talking about hope being around the corner.</p> <p>Kerry is a strong finisher, so we are not giving up hope yet. To me it's really important to stress the fact that this is not an election that is going to be won or lost only on international issues. They are important - particularly Iraq and oil and the war on terror - but the truth of the matter is that the economy, which drives all those other things, is what is going to finally drive this. What's left right now is the swing voters, the voters who are going to worry about what's gonna happen to them; they don't really care what happens to other people.</p> <p><b>Clive Soley MP</b><br> There is an interest for us in what the US does, and that is for the US to be a team player, and that is what it is not likely to be under George Bush and the Republicans as they are at present. Let me say that since he first emerged on the scene, Kerry has struck me as being strong in personality and being strong in policies, so I have a positive approach to it. People ought to vote for him because he comes over as a good guy with also the right sort of policies and saying the right sort of things for today's world. It's a positive message. I don't think the Democrats could come up with someone better.</p> <p>His problem is partly about the economy. People tend to turn to rightwing parties when the economy gets a little bit rocky. Leftwing parties do best when things are getting better, which is why Kerry is having a bit of a problem with that issue. </p> <p>Kerry and the Democrats winning is very important to the rest of the world because the US, being the sole remaining superpower, does need to be on board on a lot of issues. The two most important challenges facing this planet in the 21st century are global warming and failing states. The two will dominate the politics, and economics, and social stability of this world I would say for the next hundred years, and we really have to work on that. We can only do that together. </p> <p>Europe and the US being close is very important, and that's important to Britain. Britain can have a unique bridging role between Europe and the US. There are problems in that relationship, big problems, but in a way we are better able to face that.</p> <p>The last point is that if there is a Kerry presidency, he has got take on board the Palestine-Israel issue. It is central and it is one that, although Bill Clinton did an awful lot on it, has not always been the strength of the Democratic party.</p> <p><b>David Aaronovitch, Guardian columnist</b><br> I think it is the right thing to support Kerry, but it won't make the slightest bit of a difference. First, there is absolutely nothing that we can do about this election. It is not up to British prime ministers to attempt to influence American presidential elections, for two reasons. First, it doesn't work. What do you do when you end up with the president you have campaigned so hard against? That's not how international politics work. Second, whatever the consequence, whatever the result is, we have somehow to manage it, we have to work with whatever it is, we have to think about how from that other position we try to get the things out of the situation that we decide we want. </p> <p>The third point is that it is the American presidential election, and consequently the result, is exceptionally important for us. I am going to add something which is very unpopular here. I think that the polls are probably the first major indication we have about how this election is going to go. We now know probably what are the issues that are going to define the results. The economic assault on George Bush has not yet, and probably will not, sufficiently convince a large number of people that they ought to drop a president that they see as strong in security in what they would regard as midstream. I too would like to see a Kerry victory but I think as at this moment it is very unlikely.</p>",
  "<p>In 1957, Heinrich B\u00f6ll published his famous travel book Irisches Tagebuch, which was later translated as Irish Journal. The Irish hated it and the Germans loved it. For the Irish it had too many donkeys and stone walls, too much dreaming and backward innocence. For the Germans, however, it was precisely these simple things that became so attractive. They carried the book with them in their rucksacks, searching for a kind of emotional connection to the people and the landscape. It gave them a sense of innocence and belonging, an inner life of feelings that was denied to them in their own country. </p> <p>In fact, it was not a book about Ireland at all, but a book about all the things that were missing in Germany. Ireland was abundant with elusive qualities such as soul, sadness, longing, timelessness, all the romance of liberation and freedom. The Irish lived like there was no tomorrow. There was music everywhere and drinking. And maybe it is exactly this intoxicating naturalism, this idealism of uncomplicated life, which appealed so much to the German mind. Ireland had the same iconic value as the Che Guevara poster on the bedroom wall. </p> <p>Had B\u00f6ll written the same book about Germany, it would no doubt have been shunned as fascist. On the cliffs of Moher, the German could find a sense of home that had no ideological associations. They could learn to play the tin whistle and even sing songs about freedom. Unlike the Irish, Germans abroad tend to forget where they come from. There is no German enclave in New York as there used to be. Where the Irish and the Italians always longed to be on the map, to he heard and not forgotten, the Germans longed to be invisible. </p> <p>The emotional attachment to home, to the land, to the place in which you are born, is something hereditary that lies deep in the human psyche, which is why it could be so abused by Nazi ideology. The result of this abuse is the systematic denial ever since of any feelings of belonging, a denial that has become so pervasive in German consciousness that it has erased these human instincts almost completely. </p> <p>Of course the Germans have feelings. They fall in love, they have desires like everyone else, they feel passionate about football and you can hear the odd person proclaim \"I love Berlin\" or \"I love Bavaria\". Of course they feel sadness and grief, compassion, friendship, the entire spectrum of human emotions. But there was always something missing too. They had no dream-life, at least not until the Wim Wenders movie Himmel \u00fcber Berlin came out. Or maybe it started again when the Berlin wall came down, with people crying and embracing each other on the streets. </p> <p>Up to now, Germans have trained themselves to feel no pain, no sense of loss, no compassion for themselves. Nowhere in the world was the father and son gap so wide as it was in Germany. From the late 60s, young people prosecuted their parents and reshaped the German conscience. All this was essential for German renewal, but it also led to a dislocation, a kind of orphaned state. In the process of exorcising the Nazi crimes, generations of Germans also denied their own heritage and severed an emotional link with their own people. </p> <p>The hidden agony of this discontinuity has never been fully explored. In effect, they became a homeless people, and still are. The physical destruction of German cities, the occupation by foreign armies, was overcome by adapting and rebuilding. But the intellectual homelessness was more profound, and included a ruthless defection from anything that had a spiritual link with the German soul. There is an unacknowledged loneliness in being German. </p> <p>It is right that Germans have turned their back on the arrogance of nationalism. They are the only people in the world who have so comprehensively examined their own past. They have been to hell and back with guilt, and their overriding sense of duty towards their victims is unheard of in any other society. Remembering the Holocaust has replaced the crucifixion of Christ as a leading icon in our society. Memorials have become religious sites that provide a new kind of holiness and guide us towards a fair and racially tolerant society. If there is such a thing as absolution, it is only by remembering and revisiting these sites. </p> <p>But there is sometimes also the perception that the Germans are born with their heads turned backwards, that there is something which prevents emotional thought and forces them to be forever rational and watchful. There is a feeling that everything you say as a German has to be passed by the legal team first, that German expression is devoid of recklessness, that it lacks the essential ingredients of mischief and spontaneity. </p> <p>Perhaps this is the great strength of German writing. Writers like such as Peter Handke and Thomas Bernhard were admired for the way they rebuilt the language from the foundations, while Boell re-examined the Germans in a series of moral case histories. No German can easily express mother-love, least of all writers. </p> <p>A German journalist recently accused me of not being hard enough on my own father, saying that a German writer would be critically lynched for showing such sympathy towards his own parents. It is clear that the openness with which Irish writers such as Colm Toibin and John McGahern engage with family, with home, with nature and landscape, is quite different. Irish writers talk about their sense of place. Seamus Heaney's exploration of digging, for instance, would mean something else altogether in Germany. In Ireland, the bog reveals things that connect us to the past, whereas the German forests are full of self-accusing landmines. </p> <p>On a visit to Dublin some time ago, Bernhard Schlink was asked if he could explain what was so special about the German concept of Heimat, or home, to which he answered simply that he was born in Hamburg and went to school there. Maybe it is not a priority for German writers, and his extraordinary book The Reader demonstrates this contemporary German view best of all, a book in which the main character's parents are unseen. </p> <p>Could it be that the Germans are way ahead of other pre-modern societies where nationalism and homeland are still seen as virtues? Could the use of dreaming simply be obsolete in Germany? Artists such as Joseph Beuys famously mocked the German sense of home and home furnishings. But the intensity of German longing for Ireland also suggests that they still possess the same homing instinct as anyone else, only that they have trained themselves to suppress any potential patriotic links to their own origins. It's a rear-view blind spot which has erased their country from the emotional map. </p> <p>Maybe that's a progression. Maybe German humility and remorse have become the new German virtues to replace love of your country and your people. Maybe this is what it means to be German, to have a clear, patriotism-free conscience. In Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, the ambitious new architectural plans were scaled down deliberately for fear of appearing too arrogant and mighty. With time, this quiet code of humility may have become the emotional core of the new German being. A sense of place no longer applies to the ground where you have your feet, but to a collection of books you've read, films you go to, people you meet, and what you remember. </p> <p>On a reading tour in Germany, I recently asked students at a secondary school in the southern town of Otterberg if it meant anything to be German. Was there anything the Germans could be proud of? The students and teachers stared back in shock. Nobody knew what to say. I had explained to them that my German-Irish childhood in had been plagued by these questions of nationalism, the ebbing Irish nationalism on my father's side and the legacy of German nationalism which my mother experienced under nazism. I had outlined the language war into which I had been conscripted as a child, forced to speak only Irish and German, wearing Aran sweaters and lederhosen, forbidden from speaking English. </p> <p>Maybe there is no such thing as a German national consciousness. Maybe the whole question of sovereignty is an anachronism and that the Germans have become the first true internationalists, with global tastes, speaking fluent English, at home everywhere in the world. But if nationhood is obsolete then so is identity. It would mean that there is no such thing as being German and that they possess no individuality, only the surrogate identities of Guinness T-shirts and being Irish in Irish pubs. Perhaps the Germans are in the process of going into exile, emigrating into a new global identity. </p> <p>I felt like I had thrown a grenade into the school at Otterberg. Being German was not something they had thought much about before, it seemed, apart from the fact that they all had a German history and German postal addresses. I told them that I had been called a Kraut and a Nazi as a child, that I had been put on trial by other children and that I had also denied being German. I told them I had the feeling that being German was a forbidden identity, that I still have difficulty saying \"we Germans\" and would rather just say I was Irish. I asked them what they would say if they went on holiday and people called them Krauts and Nazis. Do you ignore it? Or do you make a joke of it and say \"I'm a Kraut, and I'm proud\", like the great moment in the film of Roddy Doyle's The Commitments. </p> <p>Nobody could say a thing, until one young student finally stood up and said: \"I'm a German-Israeli-Palestinian.\" She wore no headscarf and said she felt that she had a sense of belonging in all three places, but that she also felt homeless. Another student stood up and said he was Argentinian born, but living in Germany. He said the Germans could feel proud because their history had taught them to become the most tolerant nation in Europe. As an immigrant, he was in a position to say that Germans were welcoming and took in more immigrants than any other country. A teacher added that she felt proud that the Germans had not joined in with the war of occupation in Iraq. </p> <p>Could this be something that would give Germans a sense of identity and make them less invisible, the fact that they have not entered into a war? Can the German conscience be seen as an achievement, a source of leadership in the world? Is this new global conscience something that will stop the loneliness of being German?</p>",
  "<p>For 50 years, nuclear power has been a solution in search of a problem. Now - oh, happy days! - two of them have arrived at once.</p> <p>Suddenly, climate change exists: George Bush says so. After years of ridicule, the greens' jeremiads about declining oil production are now spilling from other people's mouths. Politicians and the press have at last picked up our arguments, and are using them as a stick with which to beat us. If we care about climate change, if we care about future energy supplies, then surely we should support the revival of nuclear power? </p> <p>It is a question we have to answer. A few months ago, nuclear power was finished. The public hated it, the corporations wouldn't pay for it, the government wouldn't risk it. Its energy white paper established that there should be no new nuclear electricity without a full public consultation. </p> <p>In May this began to change. James Lovelock, the environmentalist famous for his \"Gaia hypothesis\", made this plea in the Independent: \"I am a green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrong-headed objection to nuclear energy.\" \"Green guru goes nuclear!\" the headlines said. </p> <p>They weren't quite right. Lovelock has always been an enthusiast. It is, in both senses, a generational thing. Fifty years ago, Britain was promised that nuclear power would generate \"electricity too cheap to meter\". That dream lodged in the minds of his generation: almost all the technology's big fans are over 60. </p> <p>In July, Tony Blair was asked by the parliamentary liaison committee to answer Lovelock's points. \"I have fought long and hard,\" he told the MPs, \"both within my party and outside, to make sure that the nuclear option is not closed off... you cannot remove it from the agenda if you are serious about the issue of climate change.\" </p> <p>Two weeks ago, Blair's former energy minister, Brian Wilson, bravely abandoning the convention that articles in the Observer should be written in English, assured us that \"retrievability has been established as being deliverable. In any case, waste is overwhelmingly a legacy issue. The waste produced by a new generation of nuclear stations would be incremental only at the margins.\" I haven't the faintest idea what this means, but there might be a clue in the title: \"Face the facts. The future must be nuclear.\"</p> <p>Last month, the directors of the Centre for Alternative Technology - which is supposed to be developing alternatives to nuclear power - argued that \"the worst possible nuclear disasters are not as bad as the worst possible climate change disasters\", and suggested \"a modest revival of nuclear energy in sites where there are already nuclear installations... to sell the idea to the sceptics\". </p> <p>Their premise is surely correct. Let us use the cruel moral calculus with which we became familiar during the arguments over the Iraq war. The daily discharges from a plant like Sellafield probably kill several dozen people a year. A meltdown could slaughter thousands, possibly tens of thousands. Climate change has already killed hundreds of thousands, will kill millions, and, if we don't do something pretty dramatic pretty soon, could kill billions. </p> <p>Nuclear power isn't carbon-free. Mining uranium, and building and decommissioning power stations all use oil, and concrete releases carbon dioxide as it sets. But the total emissions, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, are tiny by comparison with the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels. </p> <p>It certainly looks more expensive, when the costs of decommissioning and waste disposal are taken into account. But what about the full costs of burning coal and gas? These are, and should be, incalculable: how do you put a price on global starvation? </p> <p>And it may no longer be true to say that there is no safe means of disposing of nuclear waste. I have just read a technical report produced by the Finnish nuclear authority Posiva which, to my untrained eye, looks pretty convincing. The spent fuel is set in cast iron, which is then encased in copper and dropped down a borehole. The borehole is filled with saturated bentonite, a kind of clay. Posiva's metallurgists suggest that under these conditions the copper barrier would be good for at least a million years. </p> <p> Of course, what can be done is not the same as what will be done. There's a danger that Posiva's good example is used as a Potemkin village by the rest of the nuclear industry: a showcase project which creates the impression that the problem has been sorted out. We certainly can't expect Britain's nuclear generators to behave as responsibly as Finland's. </p> <p>On Friday, for example, the European commission took the British government to court over Sellafield's refusal to let European inspectors examine one of its dumps. (Didn't we go to war over something like this?). Some 1.3 tonnes of plutonium has been sitting around in ponds there for about 30 years. Last Tuesday, the Guardian revealed that British Nuclear Fuels has secretly buried 10,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste from other countries. This sort of thing goes on all the time. The UK Atomic Energy Authority used to chuck its waste into two open holes in the cliffs beside its power station at Dounreay. One of the shafts exploded in 1977, scattering plutonium over the beaches, but the authority didn't bother to tell anyone for 18 years. The Ministry of Defence has dumped 17,000 tonnes of nuclear waste on the seabed off the coast of Alderney. </p> <p>This, rather than Posiva's expensive method, is the kind of disposal we can expect from most of the world's nuclear generators. So it's probably fair to say that the nuclear industry will kill tens of thousands. If, as seems ever more likely, terrorists get hold of some of this stuff, the deaths could run into millions.</p> <p>So the moral calculus shifts a little, but still comes down on the side of nuclear power, if that is the only alternative to burning fossil fuel. But it's not. When Lovelock claimed that \"only one immediately available source does not cause global warming and that is nuclear energy\", he was wrong on two counts. It is not the only one, and it is not immediately available.</p> <p>A new generation of nuclear power stations can be built only with government money: the private sector won't carry the risk. It would take at least 10 years, and it would cost tens or possibly hundreds of billions of pounds. The government will not spend this money twice: it will either invest massively in nuclear generation or invest massively in energy-saving and alternative power. The Rocky Mountain Institute has shown that you can save seven times as much carbon through electricity efficiencies as you can by investing in nuclear. And you kill no one. There'd be plenty of change too for a research programme to develop cheaper solar cells, with which, in time, almost every building in Britain could be roofed.</p> <p>So the dilemma established by James Lovelock and explored by Tony Blair and his incoherent ministers is a false one. There need be no choice between two kinds of mass death. We are still permitted to choose life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The dreaming spires of Oxford University have long been a bastion for liberal greenies, people who like to slow the traffic by marching to save the whales. But Oxford is rapidly becoming home to another brand of environmentalist, one who wants to join big business and change it from within. And one who wants to take pragmatic steps to mould our relationship with the environment. </p> <p>The masters course in environmental change and management is something of an explosive mix. People with wildly varying backgrounds converge from all over the world for an intense training in the critical issues of environmental policy, only to scatter themselves a year later in diverging sectors of employment. </p> <p>Sumalee Khosla, an Indian biology graduate, has spent several years in management and came to the course hoping to link her former life as a scientist with her experience in business. American Carolyn Snyder came from a heavily research-influenced background involving environmental studies, geology, chemistry and physics. </p> <p>There are non-scientists, too. Megan Ceronsky, an American graduate in international relations, felt her background fitted perfectly with dealing with the decidedly uneven environ mental policy of the Bush administration. \"The US is a huge challenge and my own fields are probably best suited to trying to address that. The course for me is a background in science, and science as it is useful to policy,\" she says. </p> <p>For Kunal Mehta, an environmental studies graduate from India who wants to specialise in how best to produce energy for a rapidly expanding developing world, the course is a way of opening doors into areas of work he might otherwise have skipped over. </p> <p>Ishmael Dodoo, a Ghanian, wants to use his experience to push his country to acknowledge and begin to deal with the degradation of the African environment. \"Compared with the UK, environmental concerns are not very important in Ghana,\" he says. \"It's not something people really think about.\" </p> <p>Such a broad intake of nationalities and disciplines mirrors what John Boardman, director of the course and a reader in geomorphology at Oxford, says is crucial to current environmental policy-making. \"Gone are the days when the building of a dam is a matter of an economic analysis and an engineering report,\" he says. \"Today the needs of indigenous peoples or water-users also need to be considered.\" </p> <p>His interdisciplinary approach has undoubtedly been a success: 10 years on and with nearly 300 applications a year for 30 places, it is one of Oxford's most sought-after courses. Students from 48 countries have passed through the doors of the Environmental Change Institute, and its alumni occupy positions of influence around the world in environmental consultancies, national governments, the EU and the UN. \"At the Hague 2000 Kyoto protocol meeting, 13 alumni were representing governments and NGOs [non-governmental organisations],\" says Boardman with some pride. </p> <p>The competition for places inevitably filters only the most committed and ambitious. This is a group of students who are clear not only where their aspirations lie, but about how to persuade the world at large to be more environmentally conscious. </p> <p>They recognise that campaigning and educating the general public on their subject has to be more subtle than angry flag-waving. \"This generation of environmentalists doesn't go to extremes,\" says Khosla. \"They tend to get into mainstream businesses in a way which is much more effective than trying to be sensational about things.\" </p> <p>But a hint of anarchy remains. \"Direct action still has a role to play - there are certain issues people need to get angry about,\" says Jonathan Avis, a British geography graduate who sees himself working for an NGO in the future. </p> <p>And meeting the original enviromentalists is an important part of the course. Field trips include visits to the Lake District and South Downs, with talks by experts on traffic, farming, planning and tourism. Three years ago, the students met Lakeland farmer Willie Tyson, hailed as their favourite lecturer after a farmyard discussion of economics and sustainability. \"Teaching quality assessment may have problems with that one,\" quips Boardman. </p> <p>Being exposed to so many different ideas has worked well and the students already have some big plans. Avis, for example, argues that people still do not feel personally responsible for the state of the planet. \"I don't think it goes down to the individual enough. People read about it and, if it doesn't affect them directly or their children, then it really goes over their heads,\" he says. </p> <p>But Ceronsky argues that perhaps the only way to reverse environmental damage is to remove responsibility from the individual: \"Instead of look ing at behaviour change, should we be looking to change the context in which behaviours are taking place so that those behaviours are no longer so environmentally destructive?\" </p> <p>She says, for example, that there is a role for the development of a new technology to move to a renewable energy-based economy. When the environmental implications of energy consumption are not as damaging as they are today, it will cease to be an issue that needs constant attention at individual level. </p> <p>A trip to the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales outlined the progress already being made on that front. But it also brought frustrations. </p> <p>\"The feeling I got after staying in that alternative energy centre was that it's unfortunate it's still seen as alternative,\" says Mehta. \"Centres like this breed the notion of these things being alternative. I don't think there's enough effort to make us feel it is not alternative, it is commercially viable.\" </p> <p>And with this realisation comes responsibility. Because it will be this unsatisfactory world of oil companies and suspicious members of the public that students from this course will have to engage with and, ultimately, change. </p> <p>But whatever they end up doing, the spires of Oxford may be serene in the knowledge that noisy marching probably won't be involved.</p>",
  "<p>Over half the patients in psychiatric hospitals were threatened during their stay and 20% were physically assaulted, the mental health charity Mind reports today after a survey of conditions on the wards. </p> <p>It found that 51% of recent or current inpatients said they had been verbally or physically threatened, 18% were sexually harassed and 5% were sexually assaulted. </p> <p>The charity said it was particularly concerned that 23% of patients were accommodated on mixed sex wards, which the government had promised to abolish by 2002. </p> <p>Patients with access to single-sex bathrooms and daytime facilities consistently felt safer and were more likely to feel that the hospital environment helped their recovery than those without. </p> <p>The charity said: \"We found a climate of fear on many wards, with patients exposed to harassment, abuse and un-therapeutic conditions, exacerbated by overworked staff, often from agencies, who can sometimes treat patients with a lack of dignity and respect.\" </p> <p>The charity's report comes as the government prepares to publish a draft mental health bill tomorrow. Its main purpose is to introduce powers for the compulsory treatment in the community of patients who might pose a risk to others, but are not ill enough to be sectioned. </p> <p>More than half said the hospital surroundings did not help their recovery. A third thought they had made their health worse. Only one in five thought they were treated with respect by hospital staff. </p> <p>Richard Brook, the charity's chief executive, said: \"Ward Watch paints a picture of two extremes in the NHS: examples of excellent practice experienced by some, contrasted sharply with the pitiful conditions that others endured.\" </p> <p>The Department of Health said that it appreciated the concerns, but could not accept the validity of findings based on a sample of 4% of patients.</p>",
  "<p>Policymakers are frequently criticised for being out of step with the opinions of so-called real people, so it is refreshing to realise that we sometimes get it right. New research shows there is a desire for a credit framework amongst learners themselves. Surprisingly, perhaps, the potential learner on the street is echoing one of the aspirations of a government committed to tackling the UK skills deficit - they want their learning to count towards something they can hold in their hand as evidence of their achievement. </p> <p>The call for a credit framework has been around for many years in post-16 circles. The recently published report from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, New Thinking on Reform, maps out the steps towards creating a comprehensive qualifications system, and is the first clear sign that flesh is being put on the bones of an idea that has been widely welcomed. </p> <p>The reality of the credit framework, though, is still some years away. So, while we are thinking about the learners who will be coming through the system in the future, we also need to think hard about what we have to offer learners now. </p> <p>The First Steps into Learning research, commissioned by the Campaign for Learning and learndirect, set out to explore what would motivate \"rejecters of learning\" - the 16% of the adult working population for whom learning holds little or no appeal - to take that first step into learning. </p> <p>Those questioned were clear about what they wanted. At the risk of using a prevalent political buzzword, they wanted choice. They wanted choice about how, when and where they learn. They wanted flexibility, an alternative to traditional classroom learning, and the opportunity to learn in \"bite-sized\" chunks as it suited them. They also wanted learning to be relevant to their lives. </p> <p>Many of those questioned were clear that if they were going to learn, they wanted to be able to get a qualification as a result. Qualifications were seen as a route to employment or a better job, to more money or a move to a different area. For many, qualifications were cited as the motivation to learn. </p> <p>This demand for qualifications is coming from the very people the government sees as a key target. While this endorses the work of the QCA and all the agencies working to make the credit framework a success, it is also a wake-up call. Without a credit framework, the risk is that switched-off learners, who may only be motivated to learn by getting a qualification, will slip through the net. </p> <p>These are people who would derive significant personal benefit from learning, whose families and communities would feel the impact, and who, with new skills, would be better placed to make a contribution to the country's economic prosperity. </p> <p>Over the past four years, around 1.5 million people have taken a learndirect course. Sixty per cent of them had done no formal learning for three years or more, and nearly half claim they would not have started learning without learndirect. These are impressive figures, which remind us, in our target-driven environment, that achievement can be measured in a range of ways, including - but not exclusively - through qualifications. </p> <p>These new research findings prompt me to ask whether the fact that the sector cannot always offer a learner an accredited course will hold us back from reaching our target of level 2 qualifications for 3 million people. To put it more bluntly, we can't get learners to progress if we don't have the means to hook them in. Without a mechanism to measure their achievements, how will we keep them motivated? </p> <p>So what can we do to ensure we do not let down \"hard-to-reach\" learners while the necessary process of build ing a robust credit framework is under way? Let's not wait. Let's build on the partnerships that are already in place across the learning and skills sector to tackle this issue. </p> <p>We want to see more of the kind of close partnerships demonstrated in existing pilots, where colleges are working with local learndirect centres to offer a defined pathway from bite-sized learning to college qualifications. Learndirect's national learning advice service and local information, advice and guidance services have a role to play, providing the \"glue\" between courses, and working with providers to track, signpost and encourage learners to progress from short courses on to accredited learning. </p> <p>By working together innovatively, and by listening to learners and potential learners, the QCA, Learning and Skills Council, colleges, sector skills councils, regional development agencies, the Department for Education and Skills and the learndirect and UK online network will be ensuring the future strength of the credit framework, while opening up new routes to qualifications in the meantime. </p> <p>The real measure of success will be seen if, in time, qualifications are available to anyone with the drive and commitment to achieve them, no matter where they start from or which learning route they prefer to take.<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Helen Milner is executive director of Ufi</p>",
  "<p>Most readers will remember the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the storyline being that the bad and the good can be indistinguishable. Similarly, teaching is a profession that can be seen as a good or bad career choice. </p> <p>Fundamentally, teachers need to feel good about their practice. There is a tendency to criticise practice and so belittle the status of practitioners. </p> <p>Good practice is not an imaginary phenomenon. It happens in the majority of schools on a daily basis. Teachers should feel confident that they are able to provide a secure environment in which students learn and succeed. However, behaviour needs careful management. It is difficult to believe any senior manager who feels a behaviour management plan is not needed for their school. </p> <p>The following vignette is based on the development of good practice in a small inner-city secondary school in the west of England. The majority of pupils are from the local community, a socially disadvantaged area; many are sent to the school as a last resort, having failed at more academically successful schools. After five years of struggle with poor behaviour and examination results, the deputy headteacher, supported by the local education authority and governors, developed and implemented a behaviour management plan for the school. </p> <p>The school had previously relied on school managers to address behaviour issues. Discipline was system-based, set within management structures, rather than a philosophy shared by all. When such structures exist, they can be leant on by those teachers who have a tendency to believe they are not responsible for the behaviour of their pupils. </p> <p>Inevitably, the system was allowed to decay and teachers felt disempowered. Further training and development were required to create a policy based on shared expectations. </p> <p>The low esteem in the community compounded the problem - pupils needed to be made aware that they could succeed. Expectations of pupil behaviour and work levels by staff and pupils required clearer, defined boundaries. Staff were keen to contribute. There was an emerging belief that the majority of pupils wanted an environment where they could learn. </p> <p>A Code for Success became the blueprint for behaviour management, shaped by three strands of activity: clear guidelines to pupils, parents, governors and staff; agreed expectations, parental contracts and meetings and staff discussions; and finally, much-needed support for staff, with directed support for difficult pupils. </p> <p>An outcome of the Code for Success has been a significant improvement in pupil-teacher relationships. The school developed a very full schedule of extra-curricular activities, which built on the community's strengths. Pupils' behaviour during these activities was generally good - they wanted to do well and it was possible for them to succeed. This positive behaviour has been transferred to the classroom and school corridors. </p> <p>Teachers are now in a position to try new approaches, including a review of teaching and learning styles, the introduction of accelerated learning programmes and the development of pupil self-confidence.<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Sonia Blandford is dean of education at Canterbury Christ Church University College.</p> <p>masterclass@cant.ac.uk</p>",
  "<p>How exciting it must be dreaming up a telly advert! Locked in a room with other brilliant people, spewing out ideas. There's been a fair wodge of such agonising over the latest campaign by the Basic Skills Strategy Unit being launched in a couple of weeks to brush up people's number skills. The ad pinches what is apparently a much-used American sitcom phrase: \"Just do the math\". Alas, on this side of the Atlantic we call it maths. There was a strong lobby for using the American word. But wiser souls decreed it was beyond the pale for a government agency dedicated to improving adult literacy to misspell maths. </p> <p><strong> A necessary evil</strong><br> </p> <p> Spending this week at international adult learners' week in Cape Town shouldn't prove too unpleasant a chore for Alan Tuckett, director of Niace, the grown-ups' education body.

Apparently during that thaw, before people felt comfortable about church weddings, they would invite a high-ranking army officer to the proceedings.

  "<p>By 2010, proclaims a newspaper advertisement, this country's youth - and indeed its adults, too - will possess \"knowledge and productive skills to match the best in the world\". Who is making such a breezy boast? The Learning and Skills Council (LSC). And in tossing global comparisons around, the quango is far from alone. </p> <p>The tag that tumbles most readily from ministerial mouths about the education service they are going to build is \"world-class\". So it is understandable that the LSC and almost every educational outfit have picked up the habit. It has even trickled down to student level. </p> <p>For the first time, there is a qualification that uses this buzz tag in its title. \"World-class practitioner\" is the creation of UK Skills, the body that manages the UK team in the world skills competition. To date, this title has been conferred on 30 individuals, which means - if the LSC's prediction is to come to pass - that the next six years are going to keep us all very busy indeed. </p> <p>The term world-class is easily tossed about but far more difficult to define or prove. If it were ever held to account for its advertisement, the LSC would no doubt be able to find the data to justify it. Matching the best in the world is sufficiently imprecise. Depending on which countries were included and which measures were chosen, our population could probably be shown to be above the average in its skill levels. </p> <p>UK Skills, however, appears very clear that only those who could compete with the best in the world will deserve the new qualification. This is because, as the organisation's acting chief executive, Graeme Hall, puts it, it sees the best of the rest of the world every other year at the so-called skills olympics. </p> <p>The first people it deems entitled to add world-class practitioner (WCP) to their name are 30 young British competitors who took part in last year's event in St Gallen, Switzerland. The new award is also to be piloted in the construction departments at three colleges: Hackney, Hastings and Liverpool Community. </p> <p>What is driving the introduction of the new qualification is a dissatisfaction with the notion of competence as an adequate aspiration for the national workforce, Hall says. Competence is the bedrock of the national vocational qualification system. To get an NVQ, one must demonstrate competence, and that, contends Hall and his supporters, is not good enough. </p> <p>\"We are trying to stem the national wastage where people stop at NVQ level 2 and think it's enough,\" he says. </p> <p>\"In France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria a level 3 equivalent is the norm.\" The new qualification would slot in as a level 4 equivalent. </p> <p>It is actually a variant of an existing qualification: the City &amp; Guild licentiateship (LCGI). UK Skills has the awarding body's full approval for tweaking and renaming its LCGI and deciding who gets it in its WCP form. </p> <p>The LCGI requires its holders to have been working for at least five years at a particular occupation and to demonstrate advanced levels of skill. Similarly, Hall envisages that those winning world-class practitioner status will have had a few years' experience in their trade. They will be required to undergo a year's training on evening and weekend courses to hone their skills and to adopt the WCP's six criteria into their working lives. </p> <p>\"These are what make people successful in competitions,\" Hall says, rattling them off: \"Get the job right first time. Be obsessed with accuracy. Be able to work to an externally set and non-negotiable deadline, eg it has got to be finished today. Be innovative in solving problems. Be able to work to an unfamiliar brief. Work as a team.\" </p> <p>These virtues can be taught, he says. \"We think there are a number of things we can do in exercises in training that bring these out in people and turn them from ordinary to world-class.\" </p> <p>It sounds fine in theory, but is there any demand for the new qualification? People in the target market are likely to be in their late 20s at least, and apart from being busy at work could be fully occupied with, for instance, getting married, setting up home and maybe starting families? What is the attraction of getting another qualification? </p> <p>Steve Wynn, curriculum group manager for construction at Liverpool Community College, believes the new qualification fills a gap. In a wide gamut of craft disciplines, there is no qualification that develops and recognises higher skill levels, he says. The NVQ level 4 and 5 don't fit the bill because they are for people going into management and supervisory roles. The WCP could become recognised as a badge of the master tradesman or craftsman. </p> <p>Adam Peirson, 23, is one of the few holders of the fledgling qualification by virtue of having represented the UK in cookery at the skills olympics. At 18, instead of going to university with his three respectable A-levels, as his mother, a headteacher, wanted him to do, he got himself an apprenticeship in the kitchens at Claridge's, the prestigious London hotel. </p> <p>Peirson feels the training he underwent for the skills olympics, which earned him the qualification, plus the invaluable experience gained in an institution such as Claridge's have been enormously important for propelling his career. He has risen to the level of chef de partie. \"I've learned to analyse the quality of things and to train other people to be better,\" he says. </p> <p>Graeme Hall feels a strong economic case can be made to persuade busy people to go for world-class practitioner recognition. \"The Swiss, Germans and French have much more profitable businesses than we do because they don't waste time doing things twice.\" </p> <p>He reckons world-class practitioner is a badge that will give a craftsman or woman running their own business an edge over the opposition. In five years or so, he envisages that punters trawling the yellow pages may well be looking out for the plumber or electrician, say, who is a world-class practitioner. </p> <p>That said, Britain might be thought to need another family of vocational qualifications right now like it needs more rain. Indeed, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is currently trying to rationalise the nation's bewildering battery of awards. </p> <p>But the initiative has the approval of its chief executive, Ken Boston, who attended the last skills olympics and was impressed by what he saw. He, too, thinks the time for mere competence has passed.</p>",
  "<p>T racking down software and web content resources to help teach personal, social and health education, particularly for key stages 1-2, can seem a tricky task. At this level, PSHE is not a compulsory part of the curriculum, but it is combined with citizenship and covered by a Department for Education and Skills (DfES) framework of non-statutory guidelines. Because of this overlap, differentiating between resources for the two subjects can be difficult. </p> <p>At primary level, PSHE is taught through four broad themes based on building confidence, becoming active citizens, being healthy and safe and developing good relationships between different people. </p> <p>The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta) is working with different subject associations to build guidelines on both citizenship and PSHE as new subjects. Tim Dumbleton, who handles the agency's links with the Association for Citizenship Teaching (<a href=\"http//:www.teachingcitizenship.org.uk\">www.teachingcitizenship.org.uk</a>), says several websites offer teachers a strong starting point for PSHE learning and resources, including: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Teacher Resource Exchange (<a href=\"http://www.tre.ngfl.gov.uk\">www.tre.ngfl.gov.uk</a>), where teachers post ideas and resources; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Virtual Teacher Centre (<a href=\"http://www.vtc.ngfl.gov.uk\">www.vtc.ngfl.gov.uk</a> ), for links to a vast array of resources and PSHE organisations; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Becta's ICT advice site (<a href=\"http://www.ictadvice.org.uk\">www.ictadvice.org.uk</a>), for marrying ICT with PSHE and citizenship; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Becta's Educational Software Database (<a href=\"http://besd.becta.org.uk\">http://besd.becta.org.uk</a>). </p> <p>Another popular site to search for free educational resources, recommended by the Schools Health Education Unit, is Schoolzone (<a href=\"http://www.schoolzone.co.uk\">www.schoolzone.co.uk</a>). The National Association for Pastoral Care in Education site at <a href=\"http://www.warwick.ac.uk/wie/napce\">www.warwick.ac.uk/wie/napce</a> is also worth a look. </p> <p>In addition, Dr John Cuthell, a Huddersfield University research fellow who studies the effects of ICT in education, recommends the following: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the BBC website (&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.bbc.co.\"</p> <p>uk/schools/teachers/\"&gt;www.bbc.co.uk/schools/teachers/) for primary level resources in PSHE; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Grid Club (<a href=\"http://www.gridclub.com\">www.gridclub.com</a>), where students can set up their own debates in a protected environment; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> TeacherNet (<a href=\"http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/pshe\">www.teachernet.gov.uk/pshe</a>), which contains many evaluated resources; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> World E-Citizens (<a href=\"http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/wecitizens\">www.mirandanet.ac.uk/wecitizens</a>), a protected environment site for students to post work and for teachers to organise collaborative projects with schools across the globe and run by the ICT in education MirandaNet (<a href=\"http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk\">www.mirandanet.ac.uk</a>. </p> <p>\"The interactivity of software and website content, as well as other ICT tools, is a very important component of teaching PSHE,\" says Cuthell, who believes younger children may understand words but not necessarily the concepts that much PSHE software and web content contains. </p> <p>One school using knowledge of its local environment to stimulate thought on the wider world is Southborough CofE primary, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Deputy head Jonathan Kersey works on PSHE with the school's eco council, made up of student representatives from each class from five upwards, who work together to improve their environment. </p> <p>Much of the council's work is based on the Eco Schools website (<a href=\"http://www.eco-schools.org.uk\">www.eco-schools.org.uk</a>), which shows how to set up projects and provides teaching content and techniques. </p> <p>\"We were looking for ways to develop our participation in the Healthy Schools Initiative, and the Eco Schools Project was recommended to us as a great way to expand on that,\" says Kersey. </p> <p>The website showed him how to help his students invest prize money from a competition in new litter bins for the school: a scheme the students unveiled in a school assembly. </p> <p>At Athelston primary school at Sherburn in Elmet, Leeds, deputy head Rick Weights uses software with themes that young students are all too familiar with. Taking Indigo Multimedia's It's Your Goal, he teaches years 4 and 5 about healthy lifestyles (<a href=\"http://www.itsyourgoal.com\">www.itsyourgoal.com</a>). The program takes an unhealthy footballer in a Harry Potter-style castle and uses an interactive environment of animated characters to get students to help him give up his slovenly ways. </p> <p>After an introduction to the lesson on the interactive whiteboard, students work in pairs before presenting their findings to the class in group discussion. \"This software appeals to this age group, as it presents them with topics they will come across again and again,\" says Weights. \"It delivers a lot of the teaching objectives I have in PSHE, science, and also design and technology, where I get students to use the software to design a healthy menu.\" </p> <p>Web content and software is also useful for introducing more complex subjects, such as relationship-related software for roleplay, says Cuthell. One example is Swaythling primary school, Southampton. Drew Mackay, department head and ICT coordinator, uses the Kar2ouche software application, Relationships, School and the Wider World, to teach PSHE to years 5 and 6 (<a href=\"http://www.kar2ouche.com\">www.kar2ouche.com</a> </p> <p>Initially, students work in pairs on the software, which they find non-threatening, Mackay says. At the end of lessons, ideas are shared among the class, and then their ideas and individual story strands are presented in school assembly. </p> <p>\"This software gives you a set of story boards aimed at this age group, which they are meeting on a day-to-day basis, like bullying and how both parties feel,\" says Mackay. </p> <p>\"It really is a very useful, usable tool that can be used in many different ways. The only difficult aspect is that it's so good, everyone wants to spend a lot of time on it.\"</p>",
  "<p>If it's green and wiggles, it's biology; if it stinks, it's chemistry; and if it doesn't work, it's physics. These words of wisdom and the image of a tousle-haired Albert Einstein sticking his tongue out set the tone for the homepage of the free, inspirational and fun key stage 3-4 maths/science website, <a href=\"http://www.skoool.co.uk\">www.skoool.co.uk</a>, produced by Intel and backed by the Association for Science Education (ASE) and the London Grid for Learning. </p> <p>Science teacher Andrea Coates uses Skoool with small, mixed-ability groups of 14- to 16-year-olds at the Reotas Centre in Skipton, a unit for the reintegration of permanently excluded pupils. </p> <p>The site, which introduces difficult stuff like Pythagoras's theorem in interactive, bite-sized steps and pathways, carries exercises ideal for mixed-ability classes with content linked to the national curriculum. </p> <p>\"With its numerous extension questions for SATs and GCSE exam syllabi, and its down-to-earth mix of theory and real world examples, Skoool delivers on all counts,\" says Coates. \"Teachers can customise the site to create their own lessons. </p> <p>They could select an introductory activity, follow up with a practical experiment and then conclude with revision exercises. The website can be downloaded at school or at home with an access code - ideal for students who have missed a lesson or who want to catch up.\" </p> <p>In fact, there is an enormous appetite among schools for good online resources, and Skoool is the latest in a growing number of free education websites published by companies, public sector organisations and charities. But how do teachers judge the value of free websites and incorporate them within the syllabus they are teaching? </p> <p>Peter Stevenson, manager of Gateshead City Learning Centre, assesses sites for over 30 schools in the area. \"We look at who's written it and who's put it up,\" he says. \"[We ask] is it just a company that's jumping on the bandwagon or has the material been written and developed by teachers? The reason why the BBC website <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools\">www.bbc.co.uk/schools</a> is so popular is that it has been carefully vetted. A good independent primary website we recommend is <a href=\"http://www.sparkisland.com.\">www.sparkisland.com.</a> It's full of educational games.\" </p> <p>Local authority ICT advisers are an excellent source of information about how to make best use of free websites. \"Teachers need to ask who's producing this website and why?\" says Irene Krechowiecka, e-learning development manager for Cumbria local educational authority. \"There's a lot of information about global warming, for example, on the American Petroleum Institute website but would you necessarily believe it?\" </p> <p>Phil McBride, an adviser on study support and ICT for Newcastle LEA, believes a good website must be engaging. \"We want to see colourful, well-designed pages with clear graphics and links to the national curriculum. We ask students for their favourite sites and we will post the best ones on our intranet. Young people probably spend more time on the internet than us - so why not make use of what they know?\" </p> <p>Free websites fall into several categories. There are the commercial sites produced as part of a big company's corporate social responsibility agenda. These include BT's citizenship website <a href=\"http://www.btplc.com/ict\">www.btplc.com/ict</a> and Shell's business study materials <a href=\"http://www.shell-livewire.org\">www.shell-livewire.org</a>. These sites are reviewed in resource directories by LEA ICT advisers, grids for learning and by <a href=\"http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk\">www.curriculumonline.gov.uk</a>. Teachers discover the best free websites and how to use them effectively through self-discovery or word of mouth. </p> <p>Some sites are produced by professional bodies, such as the Engineering Council, and charities, to raise an industry's profile. The sites are tailor-made for schools to fill a knowledge gap. One example is the young engineer site at <a href=\"http://www.youngeng.org\">www.youngeng.org</a> </p> <p>Museum sites are another source of inspiring online information. A good example is the Science Museum's much-acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.sparkingreaction.info\">www.sparkingreaction.info</a> Charities, too, can provide excellent background material. One example is the Greenpeace site (<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\">www.greenpeace.org.uk</a>) which offers material for projects on the environment, although it comes with a campaigning slant. </p> <p>The biggest producers of free websites are the national media and public sector, including regional grids for learning. Their content is generally independent and of good quality, as organisations like the BBC and Channel 4 have a lot of money to invest in communications and education. BBC Bitesize and Revisewise revision materials are well known to teachers at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revision\">www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revision</a> </p> <p>Teachers pick and mix, relating content to the needs of their particular classes. At Seven Kings school, Ilford, head of English Paul Lindsay-Addy has a few basic ground rules for assessing the value of a free site. \"Our first priority is that it should have a pupil-friendly format. We want to see simplified schemes of work and, where appropriate, national literacy strategy objectives,\" he says. </p> <p>The sites he is using for key stages 3 and 4 are <a href=\"http://www.universalteacher.org.uk\">www.universalteacher.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.inspiration.com\">www.inspiration.com</a>, which comes complete with mind maps - a useful tool for literary criticism and analysing poems. </p> <p>But Lindsay-Addy advises his students to use revision sites sparingly. \"You can find a lot of information on websites, but I don't want to see students spending all afternoon googling away and producing a pointless rehash. Internet research needs to be focused, so I give students questions they must find answers to. Sites easily navigable and with learning objectives, such as <a href=\"http://www.english.uga.edu\">www.english.uga.edu</a>, keep students on task.\" </p> <p>Finally, be warned that there are now so many free websites that they are best used sparingly. Krechowiecka hates what she describes as the \"lazy teacher approach\", where pupils are directed to long lists of vaguely related websites to look up during or after the lesson. This merely encourages aimless clicking. </p> <p>\"Look for educational websites with deep links,\" she advises. \"Kids need to be given specific tasks and specific places to go.\" </p> <p>If you're worried about the suitability of a website, don't use it if it meets any of the following criteria: it carries pop-up adverts, does not fit in with the school syllabus, has a poor design, or has no links to the national curriculum. You have been warned.</p>",
  "<p>Behind his desk there's a pile of door signs, exported from his old department. At the entrance to his new base at the University of Buckingham, above the estates office building, a quiet corner of a campus that rarely rouses itself much beyond sleepy, there's nothing yet to establish his presence. But Alan Smithers, the UK's most prominent education researcher, already knows his way around the market town, has moved into a rented house - on School Lane, naturally - and gives every impression of being at home. </p> <p>As August transfers go, Smithers' move from Liverpool University to Buckingham - taking his deputy, Pamela Robinson, and the rest of their Centre for Education and Employment Research (CEER) with him - wasn't quite in the Wayne Rooney league. But it did raise eyebrows. </p> <p>Smithers is an adviser to the all-party education and skills select committee, and has carried out research for organisations across the political spectrum, from the National Union of Teachers to the Department for Education and Skills to the Sutton Trust charity. Owing to his habit of informing topical education issues with interesting, evidence-based, fully-formed sentences delivered at shorthand speed, he is much in demand from reporters and has influenced more leader columns than you would care to realise. </p> <p>Now he has joined the only private university in the country, which has bolstered its arch-Thatcherite core by establishing an education department consisting of Anthony O'Hear, Chris Woodhead, Dennis O'Keeffe and visiting professor Roger Scruton. Not exactly over-run by Trots, in other words. Is Smithers more rightwing than people thought? </p> <p>\"No, I'm not at all rightwing. I am independent-minded. That's the key factor. I have been invited at one time or another to advise all three main parties. I've always turned it down,\" he says. \"If you are linked to any political party and you are coming at it from that direction, and you have to find out things that that party likes, you've got no hope.\" </p> <p>He had no qualms about coming to Buckingham. He started thinking about a move when Liverpool Univer sity, where he had been since 1988, took the \"extraordinary decision\" to merge its education department with its centre for lifelong learning. \"Clearly Liverpool wasn't going to be a propitious environment in the future.\" </p> <p>He mentioned his anxieties to Chris Woodhead, who told him of Buckingham's plans to develop the school of education and put him in touch with Terence Kealey, Buckingham's vice-chancellor. When they met, around Christmas last year, Kealey told Smithers that at 65 he was still younger than the age at which Churchill became prime minister; Smithers hopes the centre will be at Buckingham for a decade at least. </p> <p>\"It seems to me that Buckingham really represents the future of higher education,\" he says. \"It really does need to become much less reliant on government money. I'm very happy to throw my lot in with a university that's trying to point out the ways of doing it and the consequences of doing that. </p> <p>\"Higher education in Britain has got into a rather strange state. Successive governments since the late 70s have increasingly begun to act as a customer of higher education, and because they are a monopoly customer they are behaving a bit like Tesco's and Sainsbury's, making requirements of the producers of higher education. So you get these extraordinary things - like that our future doctors aren't being chosen on their capabilities, but on their school background. </p> <p>\"Really, the health of higher education depends on there being a plurality of funders so that if you are doing something that a particular funder doesn't like, there are other funders to smooth out the cash flow.\" </p> <p>That has been the model the CEER, now in its fourth home, has developed over the years, requiring as a condition of the contract that the research organisations ask them to produce is always put in the public domain. \"The difference is,\" he smiles, \"that if you find out something people like, they tend to publicise it a lot, but if you find out something that people don't like, perhaps it doesn't receive that much attention.\" </p> <p>He doesn't think the change of address will damage CEER's reputation - far from it. \"I'm banking on the independence of the university being its prime feature and backing up the independence of our educational re search, rather than anything to do with former chancellors [such as Baroness Thatcher, for instance] or the origins of the university.\" </p> <p>The trouble with his field, he acknowledges, is that it is riven with personal and political prejudice. \"Studying education is a lot more difficult than studying plants and rocks. In the physical world you can get evidence that will overturn your preconceptions: the idea that we are not on a flat earth doesn't seem to make common sense at all. People held very strongly to that view but a few measurements told us that this comfortable view of our circumstances just couldn't be held. </p> <p>\"In education you have equally strong views, but if people want to believe in selection, or mixed ability classes, or whatever, it's very difficult to come in with evidence of the quality that will overturn it ... there are a lot of people around in education who want answers to 'ought' questions and 'why' questions rather than being content with simple descriptions. They are wanting to know how education should happen and they are looking for that kind of answer from research and it simply can't give it to them.\" </p> <p>Education research, he says, is \"pretty poor at the moment\", with experts in other fields moving in and, pressured by the demands of the research assessment exercise, then beginning to justify themselves as university academics. \"They say 'what is education research?' Oh, it's giving out a few questionnaires, adding up the numbers, writing papers. They feel they need to be controversial, say something original - you are more likely to get published that way. You get these more and more outlandish ideas about education being promulgated by academic education.\" </p> <p>Smithers tries to stay above the party-political fray; that isn't the same as being uncritical. In an acidic chapter in the Anthony Seldon-edited overview of Labour's first term, The Blair Effect, Smithers accused the government of \"wilful neglect\" of higher education, of \"a cop-out\" on the structure of secondary education, and of creating a system where \"idea after idea seems to have come tumbling out, often encapsulated in a catchy two- or three-word phrase, without a full appreciation of the education system's capacity to absorb them or their relevance to ordinary pupils\". </p> <p>Three years on, Smithers is revising his view, a little bit. He praises Blair for grasping the nettle of top-up fees - no more wilful neglect there. He thinks the government's obsession with targets - which it keeps missing - has taken attention from \"tremendous improvements\" in literacy and numeracy in primary schools, and he is hopeful of serious progress in the early years. </p> <p>But he's worried about the forthcoming overhaul of 14-19 education. \"Tomlinson is a massive distraction. It's a bit like the Dome: instead of getting the A-levels right and getting some good vocational qualifications right, you are concerned about the covering.\" </p> <p>And he is even more dubious about secondary schooling. \"The specialist schools policy simply does not make sense. What happens if your child loves science and the only accessible school specialises in the performing arts? The academies are consuming an incredible amount of money and the figures are underplayed by not including land values. The admissions arrangements are a mess. </p> <p>\"Young people are required to be in education from 11 to 16 whether they want to be or not, so we owe it to them to provide equivalent opportunities. That involves putting a coherent shape on this phase of education and this is what the government has signally failed to do.\" </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Name </strong> Alan George Smithers<br></p> <p> <strong> Age </strong> 66 </p> <p><strong> Job</strong> professor of education and director, centre for education and employment research, at University of Buckingham<br></p> <p> <strong> Before that </strong> professor and director of CEER at universities of Liverpool, Brunel and Manchester; lecturer at Bradford; lecturer in botany at Birkbeck and College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea<br></p> <p> <strong> Educated </strong> at King's College, London (BSc, PhD); Bradford University (MSc, PhD) </p> <p><strong> Likes </strong> walking, theatre </p> <p><strong> Dislikes </strong> bureaucrats </p> <p><strong> Married</strong> with two children</p>",
  "<p>It may be one of the hottest seats in Britain's public sector, but the occupant looks remarkably comfortable. Ralph Tabberer heads the Teacher Training Agency, responsible for finding over 30,000 people a year to fill the gaps in the nation's classrooms. </p> <p>At the agency's office in central London, Tabberer has several things to celebrate. The TTA is 10 years old this term. Teacher recruitment is up, with nearly 35,000 coming into training this year. The government has just handed the agency new responsibilities for establishing qualifications and training for the entire school workforce, including classroom assistants, caretakers and admin staff, as well as teachers. </p> <p>And there's a new advertising campaign, with a consciously relaxed feel, reflecting the idea that teaching is a more positive career choice than in the past. </p> <p>\"Go back four or five years and teacher recruitment was the biggest single risk to the standards agenda,\" says Tabberer. \"Today we have Ofsted describing new teachers as the best ever. We are bringing in better people than ever, more highly qualified, with better skills.\" </p> <p>The new \"Use your head - teach\" TV campaign will be broadcast for the first time next Monday, launching a \u00a312.2m push created by the ad agency DDB. Though the slogan is the same as the last campaign, the controversial \"headless chicken\" ads launched last year have gone. The focus now is on children and on the things that make teaching a different kind of job. Against a background of bright, motivated children in well-equipped classrooms, the voiceover asks its audience if they would like to \"work with the most exciting people in the world\". </p> <p>Simon Veksner, co-creator of the campaign at DDB, says: \"We are targeting people who might be slightly bored in their jobs by reminding them that teenagers are fun, spontaneous and stimulating. That could tip the balance with someone who has always thought about being a teacher and now finds themselves in some boring job. The emotional rewards and the sheer interest and stimulation that they could get from working with teenagers could get them to apply.\" </p> <p>The campaign emphasises the differ ence between teaching and other jobs. Another one asks: \"Do you ever have discussions with people who haven't made their minds up yet?\" </p> <p>The ads illustrate a change of tack by the TTA. In the 90s, teacher recruitment ads featured John Cleese and a pantheon of other celebrities who offered the name of a teacher who had inspired them. Tony Blair named Eric Anderson, his housemaster at Fettes. </p> <p>This campaign was popular in schools, focusing on the message that teaching was a worthwhile career, that teachers made a difference to people's lives. But the \"No one forgets a good teacher\" ads coincided with the TTA's worst recruitment figures. Worthy didn't work. </p> <p>\"We realised we needed to advertise to attract people,\" recalls Tabberer. \"Would-be recruits thought they would lose money, because of the extra year's study, or because of pay. People were put off by perceptions about what schools are like.\" </p> <p>Beginning with the \"Those who can _\" adverts, the TTA has moved to emphasise pragmatic reasons for doing the job. It's about training salaries, golden hellos and the fact that teachers do a job where they work with young people and also use subject knowledge from their university degree courses. </p> <p>It also reflects a changing recruitment picture. Far from being dominated by idealistic, wet-behind-the-ears graduates, new recruits to teachers are increasingly older. In 1998, less than 47% of recruits were over 25 and one in four were over 30. The most recent available figures, for 2002-3, show that 56% of recruits were 25 or over and one in three was 30 or over. \"As a second career choice we must be one of the top choices in the economy,\" says Tabberer. </p> <p>The turning point came in 2001, when numbers of trainee teachers jumped for the first time. There have been year-on-year increases ever since. Even in London, with difficult schools and high living costs, there are signs that the recruitment crisis could be past its worst. Westminster city council reported in July that teacher turnover was down for the third year running. For newly qualified teachers the figure had almost halved, with more people sticking with their schools. </p> <p>Most observers cite the introduction of the \u00a36,000 training bursary as the real reason for the increase, but Tabberer begs to differ. He points to the other major changes that were introduced at the same time. There are now over a dozen different entry routes into teaching, and Tabberer believes that the introduction of the graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been at least as influential as bursaries. </p> <p>GTP students usually have previous experience in an education or training environment and are employed in schools on a salary, usually around \u00a313,000. They train as they teach. From just 89 placements in 1997, the route has been hugely expanded. More than 5,000 GTP students started training last year. \"We made a very smart decision to go after career changers. If we had just done the bursaries, it would not have had the same impact,\" says Tabberer. </p> <p>Alan Smithers, professor of education at Buckingham University, says the government could do even more. \"The way forward is to develop the school-based route. The government is a bit reluctant to do this because it's expensive. There are lots of people who want to think about teaching later in life and the natural way for them is to take a job in school and receive a salary while training.\" </p> <p>But Ted Wragg, emeritus professor of education at Exeter university and Guardian columnist, is concerned about the move towards more school- based training, whether by the GTP route or through Scitt (school-based initial teacher training), where a consortia of schools link with a higher education institution to run the course. </p> <p>\"One or two of these have done well, but others have disappointed,\" he says. \"It's not what schools ought to be doing.\" He points out that university departments can look for the brightest academics in their field and offer students the benefit of their expertise. Busy teachers cannot compete with that depth of provision, and shouldn't be expected to, he says. </p> <p>All trainees spend time in schools, which are paid a fee for the support they give to the student teacher. The student teacher should be paired with a mentor and allowed time and space to prepare lessons and work on their course portfolio. GTP students, who are employed full-time by their schools, are also supposed to have enough free time to complete their studies. </p> <p>Research I have conducted, due to be published in a book next year, will reveal that a significant minority of schools are failing to offer the support they have contracted to provide. A quarter of the students going into schools for the first time were offered no induction programme. Some students were not allocated a mentor, and others had been used to cover for absent staff. </p> <p>\"It was extremely hard to gain any information on the school,\" said a 24-year-old languages teacher at a Midlands school. Another student believed the school had overloaded itself with trainees. \"We are viewed as an additional source of income and manpower which the school can gain in exchange for providing a bare minimum of training,\" he said. </p> <p>My survey found GTP students being asked to teach from the first week of their course, in contrast with students following the conventional route, who would normally spend several weeks observing experienced teachers before being asked to take a class. </p> <p>Teacher unions are concerned that student teachers are being used to cover for absent staff at their placement schools, a practice that is now legal under changes to the teachers' contract made last year. </p> <p>Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, has raised these issues with the TTA. \"The issue is how they maintain quality control over the courses they contract out,\" she says. </p> <p>Tabberer's agency hasn't solved all the problems, by any means. Teaching faces a demographic time bomb in the next 20 years, as a largely middle-aged profession nears retirement. There are also problems caused by high drop-out rates: an estimated 40% of teachers leave the job three to five years after training. \"You're training about twice the number of teachers you actually need through the teacher training process,\" says Smithers. </p> <p>\"On secondary teaching the jury is still out and we are very short of good teachers in a numbers of fields: maths, modern languages, physics, chemistry.\" New figures from the graduate teacher training registry show a drop in applications for PGCE courses in languages, although overall PGCE courses for secondary schools have increased. </p> <p>In some areas of the country and some types of teaching - particularly at primary level - there has never been much shortage of teachers, and the TTA's success in attracting candidates has created problems for people who have spent a year training only to find that they cannot get a job. Earlier this summer one northern college hosted a leaving event for newly qualified teachers, during which a rough count revealed that fewer than one in five had a teaching post to go to this term. </p> <p>The imbalances between supply and demand come substantially from the way that training places are distributed. Demand is highest in the south and south-east. But the TTA funds thousands of places in the north-west and in Yorkshire. Students at Lancaster St Martin's, Manchester Metropolitan and Leeds universities all face real competition once they qualify. </p> <p>Tabberer is unmoved. \"Our prime role is to improve teaching quality,\" he says. \"We are clear that schools want a lot of choice about who they take on. So we see value in making sure that there is a very good supply. When we recruit people into teaching we are trying to make sure that they have a job, but I don't think, in a modern economy, it's a bad thing to say to people, 'You haven't got a guarantee of a job, competition will be stiff, you may have to look around for a bit'.\" </p> <p>The anomaly over the distribution of training places is just one of the many things that Tabberer inherited when he took over the TTA four years ago. That legacy included a hugely prescriptive approach to teacher training and a poisonous relationship with the higher education institutions that provide most of the training places. The TTA was created by the Conservatives in 1994, against a background of hostility to the teaching profession. The original board included Anthony O'Hear, then professor of philosophy at Bradford University, and Caroline Cox, chancellor of Bournemouth University. Both were hostile to conventional teacher training. The Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (Ucet) was offered no places on the board. This was the era of \"name and shame\", a time when Chris Woodhead, as Ofsted's chief inspector, was lamenting the existence of 15,000 \"incompetent\" teachers in the nation's schools. </p> <p>Anthea Millett, the agency's first chief executive, and previously Woodhead's second in command at Ofsted, said at the time that her first target was to raise the quality of entrants to teacher training. TTA officers were seen as high-handed, arrogant and dictatorial. Ted Wragg once described the 851 competencies set out in the first training standards as \"ridiculously excessive - 850 too many\". Though these competencies have since been whittled down, Wragg says inspectors are still looking out for them when they assess the training institutions. </p> <p>\"What they should have done was set out half a dozen generic competences,\" he says now. \"Those first few years of prescription set in stone what the agency is now trying to shake off. Ralph Tabberer has tried to do a lot and some of the recent senior appointments are very good, but they inherited an agency that was the tool of government.\" </p> <p>Four years ago, when the then schools minister Estelle Morris briefed Tabberer about his new role, she told him that the thing she regretted most was that the government had been ambivalent about the contribution of higher education to teacher training, and that she wanted that contribution to be recognised and supported. </p> <p>\"That set the tone for me: it was very much about working with people, not about picking fights,\" says Tabberer. \"Ten years on, I don't know anywhere in the world where you can point to the same trajectory of year-on-year improvement.\" </p> <p> <strong> Ted Wragg, page 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Alan Smithers profile, page 20</strong></p>",
  "<p>Is a university unmanageable? asks Gillian Evans in her entertainingly waspish account of Cambridge University's recent management problems, published last week. Certainly, managing academics is frequently compared to trying to herd cats. </p> <p>As 14 new heads of British higher education institutions take over the reins this term, the problem of how to run them has never been more pertinent. Gone are the days when universities were left to get on with running themselves. They are engines of economic growth now, not ivory towers. Government ministers have made no secret of their belief that universities should be run in a more businesslike fashion and the Treasury commissioned a review by former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert to shake them up. Though his report didn't really prove their case, that hasn't stopped ministers' enthusiasm for making academia more efficient - but, as one vice-chancellor was heard to sigh, \"They've only got the country to run, they just don't realise how difficult it is to run a university.\" </p> <p>In answer to her own question Evans, a professor of medieval theology, writes: \"Two questions need to be separated very carefully here. In one sense the answer is 'yes'. Academics have to be independently minded and articulate and challenging. That is their job. That means that 'line management' is not going to work. Good, supportive management may. </p> <p>\"The other question, and the one at the heart of this book, is whether there is still a place for academic democracy in the management of universities.\" Her book, Inside the University of Cambridge in the Modern World, is a passionate plea for that academic democracy, embodied in the 3,000-member \"dons' parliament\", Regent House. \"It has brought Cambridge to its 800th anniversary still full of intellectual life and fighting bravely to keep in its place the necessary future of industrial liaison so that commercial interests are not allowed to subvert its purpose as a university.\" </p> <p>Cambridge is perhaps an extreme case of the antagonism that can arise between a vice-chancellor and senior management on the one hand, and their academic staff on the other, though the current dispute at London Metropolitan University, where staff last week burnt their contracts in public, shows that the issue cuts right across the sector. </p> <p>Evans's belief that line management and collegiality may be fundamentally incompatible may not be shared by all her colleagues at Cambridge but it does strike a chord with many fellow academics. </p> <p>Others it drives to distraction. Simon Bennett, a lecturer in disaster management at Leicester University, embodies the equally strongly held opposite view. He was so exasperated by the \"archaic\" ways of doing things in academia - embodied for him in the failure of the Beagle 2 mission to Mars - that he wrote a furious protest to Charles Clarke, the education secretary, saying something must be done. In reply he received a soothing letter from one of Clarke's officials extolling the creation of the the new Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, set up to improve vice-chancellors' skills. </p> <p>Hospitals, Bennett points out, are managed by qualified professional managers, not by consultants, doctors and nurses, and so should universities be. \"Vice-chancellors should concern themselves with academic standards. The university . . . should be directed by a chief executive officer, preferably recruited from business or industry. She/he should answer to a board of management, composed in the main of the university's full-time managers. Senior academics should act in an advisory capacity only,\" Bennett urged Clarke. </p> <p>\"In most areas of public life, the 'gifted amateur' has been pensioned off, and to good effect. Unfortunately, this situation does not pertain in the British university sector where archaic attitudes and practices persist.\" </p> <p>Bennett, who worked for 10 years as an IT systems manager before re-entering the university world, is also infuriated that he cannot appoint his own staff. \"As an MSc course director I do not decide who works for me. That crucial decision is made by a panel of senior academics, most of whom, in my experience, have no idea a) who I am (my university has around 600 academics); b) of the work that I do; c) of my discipline - risk management; d) of the content of my course; or e) of the typical student of risk management. This system is both archaic and inefficient.\" </p> <p>A small number of British universities have seen the light and appointed VCs from industry, but most have not, adds Bennett, who insists he is making a generic criticism rather than attacking his own institution. Working in a university is like living in a Lewis Carroll novel, he says. \"Nothing is logical or rational. For instance, there is a belief among senior academics and the senates they convene that the longer one takes to make a decision the better that decision will be. Obfuscation and delay are the norm. Opportunities are consequently missed and staff are frustrated.\" </p> <p>This year's 14 new boys and girls do not break the pattern Bennett criticises. John Hood, who takes over officially at Oxford University next month, is exceptional in having spent a long time in industry. Before running the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, for five years, he made a business career for 19 years with Fletcher Challenge, one of the country's largest firms. </p> <p>And Baroness Tessa Blackstone has experience of political office under her belt, including a stint as higher education minister, as she takes over at Greenwich, as well as experience of running a university before, as master of Birkbeck College. </p> <p>The others have come up through the academic ranks with, in some cases, brief spells in business or industry. Another Antipodean, Alan Gilbert, who is now in Manchester, ready to assume command when Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology merge next month, used to run Melbourne University. Rick Trainor vacates the vice-chancellorship at Greenwich to take the helm at King's College London. </p> <p>Others to come from the ranks of current academia include Paul O'Prey, who takes over as head of the new Roehampton University from the only nun in the VCs' club, Dr Bernadette Porter; Peter Gregson at Queen's University Belfast; John Coyne at Derby; Michael Arthur at Leeds; Madeleine Atkins at Coventry; and David Tidmarsh at Anglia Polytechnic University. </p> <p>The University of Wales boasts two new VCs - Noel Lloyd at Aberystwyth and Merfyn Jones at Bangor. Deborah Swallow will take over at the Courtauld Institute of Art, in London, and the Royal Veterinary College is now headed by Quintin McKellar, who was installed last month. </p> <p>Ewart Wooldridge, the head of the Leadership Foundation, used to run the civil service college and is familiar with debates about professionalism and the gifted amateur. He does not think there is a single formula for running all universities. And he doesn't think vice-chancellors should all be recruited from outside academia. \"I don't think leadership can be enforced by people who don't understand the core business. That applies in the private sector and the civil service, and even in the NHS there isn't a complete schism.\" </p> <p>He says to talk about a shift to top-down managerialism is an oversimplification. \"Universities are becoming more complex institutions and those at the top are going to need to be equipped with managerial skills and abilities, but they are not running plcs. They need to be responsive to a unique academic environment. I'm quite sure the answer is not going to be a simplistic top-down managerialism.\" </p> <p>The foundation was launched by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in March with the declared vision \"that the leadership, governance and management of UK higher education institutions is regarded as world-class and the practice of excellence in leadership is recognised and held in high esteem by the higher education sector\". </p> <p>While Wooldridge's job is to help improve the running of UK universities, he does not agree they are badly run at the moment. \"They have survived and adapted to change and delivered extraordinary results - one has to start from a pretty positive view.\" </p> <p>But they face a combination of challenges at the same time now - how to deal with globalisation, the expansion of higher education and attempts to broaden access - which add up to a \"tricky\" agenda, he says. </p> <p>On the foundation's own agenda is the recent report by Eric Thomas, vice-chancellor of Bristol, questioning whether the role of the vice-chancellor will have to be radically rewritten as universities move further into the private sector and fundraising becomes a major preoccupation. Some American university heads do little else. Thomas's working group looked at the US, where the vice-chancellor's job is done by a president who handles external relations and a provost who handles the budget and staffing. This summer he told Education Guardian that the vice-chancellor's job was \"un doable by a single individual, now, in a big university in this country\". </p> <p>He added: \"The issue in 2004 is what expectations can we have of a vice-chancellor, and if they are going to have to move to a more presidential role, how do we then support and develop that other very important aspect of the leadership, which is the operation of that institution?\" </p> <p>The merged London Metropolitan has adopted the American model with a president, Roderick Floud, the former head of London Guildhall, and a vice-chancellor, Brian Roper, who used to run the University of North London. But while it may help an institution to raise more money for academics to get on with their jobs, and so oil the wheels, the London Met example shows it certainly does not end the tension with management. </p> <p>In the meantime, perhaps, both sides can agree that a more professional approach and more training - not just at the top - are necessary. </p> <p>Some of Evans's strongest criticisms of Cambridge are aimed at the amateur \"oligarchy\" of senior academics who were unable to read a balance sheet or who were ignorant of basic equal opportunities procedures for either staff or students. </p> <p>The arrogance of academic heads of department was one of the \"besetting sins\" of the university, she notes. \"It was not easy to get academics, especially senior Cambridge academics, to accept that they did not already know it all.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Inside the University of Cambridge in the Modern World, \u00a374.95, Edwin Mellen Press</p>",
  "<p>The government is to investigate the cash crunch facing biotechnology companies in Britain after complaints that they are being hampered by tough rules on fundraising.</p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry has appointed Paul Myners, the chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, to head a study group that will look at the rules governing pre-emption rights - according to which companies must go to their existing shareholders first when raising new funds.</p> <p>The committee will look for evidence that the rights are restricting the growth of biotechnology companies and those in other industries where frequent fundraising is required. Biotechnology companies claim that having to go first to existing shareholders slows the whole financing process at crucial times in their development - and is expensive.</p> <p>The government is keen to promote the life science sector because it wants to build on the country's number two global position; it is also a skilled, added-value industry. </p> <p>The group will seek the views of investment companies and venture capital firms. It is unlikely that pre-emption rights will be scrapped altogether but the process of fundraising could be altered. </p> <p>Shareholder groups such as the Association of British Insurers are opposed to relaxing the pre-emption rules as they say existing shareholders in a firm could see their stake diluted on unfavourable terms. </p> <p>Mr Myners used to run the investment group, Gartmore, and he is chairman of Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian and Observer newspapers. </p> <p>The DTI recently commissioned a report into the difference in biotechnology fundraising in the United States and Europe, which revealed that in 2002 American biotechnology firms raised \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.5bn), while in Britain only \u20ac676m was raised. </p> <p>This discrepancy is forcing many biotechnology firms to look at moving some of their operations to the US in order to ease the raising of capital. </p> <p>The biotechnology industry says one of the reasons for the difference in funding levels is pre-emption rights in Britain. The rules mean that, in a new share issue that is larger than 5% of the existing share capital, the firm must go to existing shareholders first to see if they want to invest. Bioscience 2015, a report commissioned by the government, recommended that the pre-emption guidelines should be amended so that life science companies would be able to issue up to at least 20% of their share capital to any investor.</p> <p>Biotechnology companies have to raise money frequently because investors are nervous in Britain following numerous high-profile failures such as British Biotech, and want to fund drug development in short phases rather than giving them enough money to see them through the average of 10 years it takes to bring a drug to market. </p> <p>Mr Myners will set up a committee representing various sectors and shareholder groups. It will present a report in the new year to science minister Lord Sainsbury, following which there is likely to be further consultation with interested parties in the process. </p> <p>The ABI warned that any differential rules for the bio technology industry could put off investors in the sector.</p> <p>\"Pre-emption rights are very sensible and very fair; they prevent companies issuing shares at a discount to their friends and undermining the rights of long-term holders,\" said Peter Montagnon, the investment director of the ABI.</p> <p>\"We are actively looking at this issue, raised in the context of the bioscience sector,\" said a spokesman for the DTI. \"We expect to be able to make an announcement shortly.\"</p>",
  "Horror and revulsion are the most natural of reactions to the aftermath of the hideous Beslan school siege, and the thoughts of decent people everywhere go out to the bereaved and suffering. A world where hearts have long been hardened by televised death from New York to Falluja and Darfur has been badly shaken by the nature and scale of this appaling atrocity in the Caucasus. But sympathy for the innocent victims and their families is not enough: what, if anything, can others do to help Russia in its agony? <p>Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, was keen yesterday to emphasise mourning, solidarity and condolences, and to leave broader issues for another day. Understandably, he also wanted to avoid the white hot fury Moscow directed at Ben Bot, foreign minister of the Netherlands and holder of the EU's rotating presidency, who clumsily demanded an explanation as to how this terrible disaster could have happened. The Dutch scrambled to insist that their weekend statement had been misinterpreted. But they, and many others, still want the question answered: the savagery of the Chechen perpetrators is a necessary but not sufficient explanation of what happened. </p> <p>Russia has always reacted with enormous sensitivity to any foreign criticism of its hardline policy in Chechnya, and western governments have learned to tread extremely carefully, especially since the September 11 2001 attacks on the US allowed Vladimir Putin to sign up to the global \"war on terror\". It suits Mr Putin to emphasise Chechen links to Islamist extremists including Osama bin Laden, though the heart of the problem lies in Chechnya itself. Thus grandiose rhetoric about humanitarian intervention and the internationalisation of human rights - part of the arguments for intervention in Kosovo and Iraq - has not been translated into reality despite widespread evidence of human rights abuses by Russian troops and security forces. Lamentably little has been done to drive home to the Russians the fundamental point that a puppet government in Grozny, dubious elections and crushing poverty will not drain the swamp that breeds such nihilistic violence. </p> <p>In current circumstances it is bleakly certain that the Russians will be no more amenable than before to any international pressure for change. Last week's UN security council resolution, actively sought by Moscow, was framed to condemn the \"heinous crimes\" of the Chechens, not to give the UN a role in monitoring or policing the conflict. But if there is to be a way forward, outsiders must get more involved in whatever ways they usefully can. </p> <p>Experts suggest that western help to train Russian special forces might be welcome: Mr Putin has publicly acknowledged the evident shortcomings of their performance at School No 1 in Beslan, part of the wider weakness of the post-Soviet state. The west should also be quick to press home the case for better access for humanitarian relief organisations, which have long been hampered by the Russian military. It could then hold out the carrot of longer-term structural aid and institution-building that the EU - desperate to do something constructive with its most important and volatile neighbour - would be prepared to mobilise as part of a broader strategy. Observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - a body favoured by Moscow - should be allowed to operate freely in Chechnya. Restrictions on journalists, one of the reasons so little is known about the war, should be lifted too. Security - stopping evil people killing the innocent - is paramount. Yet hearts and minds must be won as well. It will now be harder than before, but Russia's friends have a duty to urge it to seek political dialogue that promises some slender hope beyond the bloodshed.</p>"
