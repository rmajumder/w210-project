  "Today marks the halfway point in the UN security council's 30-day ultimatum to the government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias, responsible for what is commonly described as the world's worst humanitarian disaster. Already it is apparent that the response of the Islamist regime will be to continue bluffing it out with protests of injured innocence in the hope that the international community eventually gives up and loses interest. <p>Daily reports of attacks against civilians continue to come in from across Darfur; 30,000 people are said to have fled in the latest round of violence. But far from restraining the militias, the government is providing continued military support for their campaign of ethnic terror. In the past week the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that helicopter gunships had again been used in attacks; and the traumatised victims of earlier atrocities, crammed into refugee camps, continue to suffer violent assaults by the Janjaweed, often under the nose of Sudanese troops supposed to protect them. This is not a little local difficulty; it is a war waged by the government against its people. </p> <p>To the extent that the authorities have acted at all, it has been to cover up evidence of what is happening. Instead of being disarmed and disbanded, the militias are being integrated into the security forces where they will be less conspicuous. Refugees are being pressured to return to their villages with threats of violence or offers of desperately needed food, only to become victims once again. Those who speak to international observers are being rounded up and imprisoned, according to Amnesty International. And aid workers attempting to get supplies to those most at risk from malnutrition and disease are reporting new government-imposed restrictions on their operations. Everything that is being done is a calculated play for time. </p> <p>The reaction of the Khartoum regime is scarcely surprising. Little of what the international community has done suggests that the political will exists for any meaningful intervention. The watering down of security council resolution 1556, as a result of pressure from several states, will not have been lost on Sudan's rulers. While the original draft contained an explicit threat of sanctions, the final version did little more than vaguely promise to \"consider further actions\" in the event of non-compliance. This will have been interpreted, correctly, as a sign of weakness and an indication that little is likely to be done when the UN deadline expires. </p> <p>Those of the \"nothing must be done\" persuasion dismiss outside intervention as irresponsible or malevolent, and probably both. Not one of them has suggested a credible way for this hopelessly one-sided conflict to be resolved except for it to run its bloody course. They are entitled to their position, but they are not entitled to deny its human consequences. </p> <p>Splitting hairs over the definition of genocide or quibbling over how many thousands have been killed doesn't alter the fact that serious crimes against humanity are being committed with every passing day. Nor does the argument that the militias are beyond Khartoum's control. Disputes about whether the regime is orchestrating the violence or has simply lost control of events are unimportant when set against the suffering in Darfur. States that fail to protect the human rights of their own citizens forfeit the sovereign right to non-interference in their internal affairs. Without that principle, the universal declaration of human rights isn't worth the paper it's written on. </p> <p>Unfortunately, as Darfur illustrates, the UN system is singularly ill-suited to upholding its own stated values. Four of the countries that forced the threat of sanctions to be removed from the security council resolution - Russia, China, Pakistan and Algeria - have extremely poor human rights records. Two are permanent members with the power of veto, commercial ties to the Sudanese government and a strong interest in defending the inviolability of state sovereignty against the humanitarian imperative. Why do they enjoy this privilege? Because almost 60 years ago they happened to be on the winning side in a war. </p> <p>The veto power of the other permanent members is no less anomalous and no less hypocritical in the uses to which it has been put. America has exercised its veto on 79 occasions, most frequently to shield Israel from international criticism. It has also used the veto to avoid censure for its aggression against Nicaragua, the invasion of Grenada and other misdeeds. Britain and America, with occasional French support, performed the same service for apartheid South Africa throughout the 70s and 80s. With these rules, the aspiration for global justice will always lose out to the reality that there is one law for the \"great powers\" and their client states, and another law for the rest. </p> <p>Tony Blair's ambition to establish a new \"doctrine of international community\" with human rights as its central focus is struggling to make progress in the face of widespread international scepticism. Not all this is due to the fallout over Iraq. Some of it is also prompted by the fact that Blair's apparent enthusiasm for reform does not extend to asking whether it is still legitimate for Britain or any other country to insist that its own interests should take precedence over international law. </p> <p>If he really wanted to push a radical agenda, he could do worse than propose that the power to impose sanctions and authorise the use of military force should be exercised by the UN membership as a whole. The general assembly has its problems, but is a far more representative body than the security council and is becoming more so with the passage of time. The days when its membership consisted largely of the representatives of military juntas and one-party states are long gone. The remarkable progress of democratic ideas in Latin America, eastern Europe and parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa over the past two decades means that two-thirds of UN members now have elected governments. There is every reason to believe that this figure will continue to rise. Isn't it time for the world body to shake off the colonial assumptions on which it was founded? </p> <p>When the security council meets at the end of the month to consider Sudan's compliance with resolution 1556, the result is likely to be more paralysis and inaction. If Blair's reaction is to bemoan the unreasonable and unprincipled resort to the politics of the veto, someone should remind him that it's his system too. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>David Clark was a special adviser at the Foreign Office from 1997 to 2001 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:dkclark@aol.com\">dkclark@aol.com</a></p>",
  "Security officials in Baghdad were last night urgently investigating the background of 30 Iranians who were caught fighting for a rebel Shia cleric in Iraq, amid mounting concern over the involvement of the Tehran regime in the uprising. <p>The Guardian has learned that the most senior members of the Iraqi government were briefed about the capture of the men yesterday, and also told of other evidence that fighters and equipment have been crossing the border from Iran. </p> <p>The 30 men were captured in the southern city of Kut on Wednesday and officials are trying to establish whether they have any links to Tehran. </p> <p>\"We are checking their identities but if they are found to have links to the Iranians then that would be tantamount to a declaration of war by them,\" said a senior Iraqi source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>The source said members of Iraq's national security committee had yesterday been presented \"with revealing information about the extent of Iranian involvement in Iraqi affairs\", which was being taken seriously at the \"highest echelons of government\". </p> <p>There was increasing frustration \"at our neighbour's apparent indifference to cross-border security, despite promises of cooperation\". </p> <p>The source said two trucks laden with weapons destined for the fighters of the militant cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, had been stopped at the Iranian border on Wednesday night. </p> <p>Sabbah Kaddim, a senior adviser at the ministry of the interior, declined to confirm the seizure of the two trucks or the arrest of the Iranians. But he confirmed \"there were a number of non-Iraqi elements\" captured in Kut. </p> <p>He added: \"There has been a continuous stream of vehicles over the last few weeks trying to ferry arms across the border from Iran. </p> <p>\"We catch some, others must get through. The trouble is knowing who exactly is behind all this.\" </p> <p>The violence between US and Iraqi forces and Mr Sadr's supporters has destabilised Shia areas of the capital and several cities across southern Iraq where Iranian influence is at its strongest. </p> <p>Baghdad knows the unrest poses a critical test of strength for the interim administration of Ayed Allawi, whose success will be judged on the ability to deliver a secure environment in which to hold the country's first post-Saddam elections, scheduled for next January. </p> <p>Iran denies stirring up violence in Iraq. It says it does not knowingly let fighters cross the long border between the two countries, but accepts that some might cross illegally. </p> <p>Foreign fighters account for only a fraction of the insurgents in detention in Iraq. </p> <p>Relations between Iran and Iraq, who fought a ruinous war from 1980-88, have plummeted in recent weeks. Iran yesterday summoned Iraq's top envoy in Tehran over the alleged arrest in Iraq of several reporters from Iran's state news agency and the fate of a kidnapped Iranian diplomat. Iran also denounced the assault by US marines and Iraqi forces in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf as \"inhumane and horrible\". </p> <p>Foreign diplomatic observers in Baghdad have been alarmed by the \"stoking up of tension\" between the two neighbours. One senior diplomat said the Iranians were pursuing their activities in Iraq \"more aggressively than three months ago, and they were hardly passive then\". </p> <p>Some foreign diplomats, however, question whether Iran would be able to do anything in Iraq than other than \"stir things up a bit\". </p> <p>\"Iranians will never be fully trusted by a majority of the Shia in Iraq,\" said one, suggesting there was not much the Iraqi government could do other than keep relations at a manageable level and allow the \"game to play out in Iran, between those who want to help Iraq and those extremists who want to see the whole thing fail\". </p> <p>The differences among hawks and doves on the Iranian side are mirrored in the administration of Mr Allawi, some of whom represent political parties with ties to Tehran. </p> <p>The Iraqi finance minister, Adel Abdel Mahdi, a senior member of the Supreme Council for Islamic revolution in Iraq, described cooperation between Iran and Iraq as \"positive\" after he led a large delegation to Tehran last week to attend a conference on reconstruction. Iran was one of the first to recognise the new Iraqi government and has also invited the interim prime minister Mr Allawi for an official visit. </p> <p>An interior ministry official said yesterday: \"We do have problems, but we believe that we can take the problems to the Iranian side and discuss them. </p> <p>\"The invitation was something of a surprise but it perhaps is an acknowledgment that Iran realises that things could get out hand in the south. It is not in their interests for there to be chaos. Many many Iraqi Shia are against what Moqtada al-Sadr are doing, and the sensible elements of the Iranian government know that. We believe we can develop better relations if we are honest with one another.\" </p> <p>But one Iraqi diplomat, a former member of the Iraqi opposition who took part in the postwar planning, said: \"You know we didn't misread the reaction of the Shia in postwar Iraq, as many analysts have suggested; our big failing was to misread the reaction from our neighbours. They really don't want to give us a chance.\"</p>",
  "<p>World oil prices reached record highs yesterday over fears of disruption to Iraqi supplies and continued concern about the fate of the troubled Russian oil group Yukos. </p> <p>The closure of a quarter of the fields in the Gulf of Mexico over fears of damage from tropical storm Bonnie added to the worries about insufficient global supply to meet roaring demand. </p> <p>US light crude futures shot up 86 cents a barrel during the trading session to $45.66, a record in the 21-year history of the Nymex exchange. Brent futures rose a similar amount to a record $42.27 a barrel. Oil prices are now up more than a third this year and 20% since the end of June alone, with many analysts predicting $50 a barrel within weeks. </p> <p>\"Everything's gone wrong in the oil market recently. If you wanted to paint the worst-scenario picture, you could not do much better,\" said David Thurtell, a commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </p> <p>On Wednesday, oil prices retreated on a new promise from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, to pump more crude but shot up again as militants in Iraq threatened to blow up pipelines in the south of the country if US forces stormed the city of Najaf. </p> <p>The US forces launched their attack yesterday in an effort to root out militiamen loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>The Iraqi government, which had closed pipelines earlier this week because of sabotage, reopened them. </p> <p>It said it would resume exports immediately. Iraq pumps about 1.7 m barrels a day, or about 2% of world output. </p> <p>That news was sufficient to push prices back from their records, as was news from several oil majors that Bonnie had passed and workers were returning to oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>",

  "<p>Professional, semi-professional - there's even been talk of the club going full circle and reverting to amateur status this season. What has happened at Fulham?<br> There's been no change in status, I can assure you of that. Last season we were semi-pro, and this season we're still semi-pro. We had talked about looking to raise sponsorship, which is what seems to have got people confused, but it's basically a part of our drive to stay semi-pro: we can't keep going to the club saying \"Can we have this?\" \"Can we have that?\" If we can go to them and say \"We've got this, can you top it up?\" then it makes us more self-sustaining while still being part of the fabric of Fulham.</p> <p><strong>So everything's fine?</strong><br>We've got the complete backing of the chairman and the board, and we're financially viable for the season to come.</p> <p><strong>Eh? Only one season?</strong><br>Well, next season the men's commercial deal [with dabs.com] is up, so we will then become part of the next commercial deal, we'll be part of the bigger picture at Fulham. We've also just started an academy at Kingston College, for girls to go into further education and football. If we weren't going to be around anymore, there wouldn't be much point to that would there?</p> <p><strong>Sounds like you're laying some pretty hefty foundations for the future then?</strong><br>We already knew that a couple of the England players would leave, so we thought 'Well, if we're going to lose two, let's look at developing the club for the future now.'</p> <p><strong>And does the future look bright?</strong><br>Well we've got the Centre of Excellence for under-10s through to under-16s, then we've got the academy for girls coming out of the Centre of Excellence, they're then going to be the core of the reserves, and the reserves will then be pushing the first teamers. We have a clear path now for girls coming in from as young as eight on the football in the community course, right through until they become senior or even international players.</p> <p><strong>Yes, those internationals - you've lost a couple this summer and it's got some excitable folk talking of an exodus, despite a veritable frenzy of movement all over the Premier League. How do you see it?</strong><br>The players at Fulham have had a unique opportunity - they've had three years as professionals, and given the option of buying into being part of a development now or moving forward for silverware and the European championships in the summer, they've gone for the new challenge, and we wish them all the very best. </p> <p><strong>So you're confident that the players are still there to help Fulham keep achieving?</strong><br> Definitely. Everyone that we've signed is either an under-17, under-19, or under-21 England international, bar one or two, so we just ignore all the 'Fulham in disarray' headlines. They're written by people that haven't spoken to us, and we're all very, very positive. We've got a good group of players, and it is going to be a transitional season: we're not looking to win anything this year, we're looking to have a development season which sees us to mid-table security. That's a realistic target for us. As far as we're concerned people can keep writing those headlines because we just want to get our heads down and move on this season.</p> <p><strong>Who will be key to making that happen?</strong><br>I think everybody, because everyone we've brought knows they're there to develop, so everybody that pulls on a Fulham shirt, whether it's for the Centre of Excellence or for the first team, is important to the future of the club. We've got some senior names like Jess Wright, Leanne Hall, and Corinne Yorston, but we can't expect them to play their own game and then help this player and that player. We just want everybody to do the best they can within the club environment.</p> <p><strong>Successfully evaded, Marieanne. Any youngsters in particular we should keep an eye out for?</strong><br> I think we have, but I won't put pressure on them by saying who they are. I know the potential of a couple of younger players in the squad, and I know what I would expect from them, but I just want to develop them without pressuring them.</p> <p><strong>Another handbrake turn into a cul-de-sac. Let's move on to the league in general - with some of the best players finding their way to Birmingham and Everton, do you think there are more contenders for the title than ever?</strong><br> Yes, but there's a lot of pressure on Birmingham thanks to those signings. I think their expectations and the expectations within women's football will weigh heavy. The pressure always used to be on Fulham because of being professional, but Birmingham will have to bear that now. They've always been a club of developing young players - and they did a fantastic job of that - and they've still got that but by bringing in star names they've invited a lot of people to expect a trophy.</p> <p><strong>Doesn't sound like they're down as your team to beat then...</strong><br>For me there's only ever one club and that's Arsenal, obviously I manage Fulham but for this season certainly they'll be favourites - they have the history, the grounding, and for me, they'll be the team to beat and always have been. </p> <p><strong>Not quite double-winners, but you've got Bristol Rovers on Sunday. Any predictions? Any fighting talk?</strong><br>No, we're going to play this season quietly, develop our players, develop our system of play and take every game as it comes. We're looking to build on what we've achieved in pre-season and we're looking forward to it.</p> <p>So there you have it: Fulham Ladies do indeed have a future, and they're already building to make it a rosy one. You can seem them take on Bristol Rovers at the Fulham training ground in Motspur Park at 2pm on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>You're playing for a local team, pitching up at 11am on Sunday mornings, bleary eyed and concentrating almost entirely on staying upright and awake. Training sessions involve laughing at the latest team member to decide their fleet-footed skills deserve more than your bog-standard black boots, or collapsing in a beetroot-shaded heap halfway through a bleep test. You get the idea: loving it, in that thoroughly unprofessional manner that characterises most grassroots sides, male or female. </p> <p>Next thing you know, Sheffield FC, the world's oldest football club, ask if you fancy joining up with them, sharing the Coach &amp; Horses ground in Dronfield, and generally being showered with the kind of support and facilities that most women's amateur teams can only dream of.</p> <p>That's what happened to Norton Ladies last summer, and this year they're experiencing even more change. First off, they've managed to secure an exclusive sponsorship deal - not bad considering that even on a national level those things are fairly hard to come by, particularly when the team is affiliated to a men's club. </p> <p>As part of the four-year deal Body Sculpture will fund everything from training facilities to travel to virtually eliminate the team's running costs - a considerable investment in a fledgling side playing in Yorkshire &amp; Humberside's First Division (if you don't know your pyramid, that's about five divisions below the likes of Charlton).</p> <p>\"Ultimately we'll be able to afford things that were well down our wish list last year,\" says captain Helen Mitchell, whose team will also be playing in adidas kits for the next three years - another big change from the usual regime of 12 shirts provided by your local balti house that shrink the first time you wash them. Surely there must be a catch? </p> <p>\"There are no conditions attached other than to promote football in the best possible light,\" she adds, \"and I'm sure we can manage that.\"</p> <p>It sounds like they can, and Mitchell, who joined the club in 2001, already seems comfortable with the extra dimensions all this investment and attention have added to her role. Is this something she imagined would happen? \"We're a ladies team: absolutely no way!\" she exclaims. \"It would have been over-optimistic of us to even think we could get a sponsor, let alone a world class kit supplier.</p> <p>\"We were hopeful that the affiliation would provide us with greater security and a more stable foundation for the team, but we never anticipated just how many doors it would open.</p> <p>All around the country women will be muttering, \"Oh, if only\", and while many clubs are keen to encourage their female teams, that eagerness isn't always converted into cold hard cash. As Norton, this group of players faced a weekly tussle to find a pitch somewhere in Sheffield, when their own facilities habitually froze or became waterlogged. And their last minute venues often looked like they'd had a particularly nasty encounter with a combine harvester, with men's Sunday League teams trudging off as the girls arrived. </p> <p>It must all seem like a distant memory, but Mitchell knows how privileged they are.</p> <p>\"Lots of the opportunities, much of the drive and enthusiasm within the club is down to individual characters, which isn't unique in itself, but they are working extremely hard for us.</p> <p>\"This is definitely something that needs to start happening throughout women's football. Obviously it requires an awful lot of hard work - and trying to find people willing to support the game - but once people understand the opportunities women's football can open up, the sky's the limit.</p> <p>\"It's about doing more than just ensuring the facilities are in place to meet demand, it's about attracting the best players to play for the club. We're just at the beginning of that process - we're still looking to improve on the club as an experience and provide the best opportunities and facilities that we can. Improvements on the pitch will follow - but it'll take longer than this season to do that!\"</p> <p>You have to wonder though whether sponsors will have different, win-at-all costs expectations once their money is involved. Helen Mitchell remains pragmatic.</p> <p>\"It's true that at our level, women's football is still very much an amateur game - people play purely for the love of the sport, and they want different things from it. It's not an easy balance but we're not going to start telling people how to live their lives.</p> <p>\"I would hope that players will recognise that they are being given the best environment for playing football and appreciate the investment being made in them and their abilities.\"</p> <p>It's hard not to feel an incredible wave of envy as skipper Mitchell explains everything that is happening to the ladies of Sheffield FC, who are being presented with a level of investment, support and opportunities that was inconceivable as recently as 18 months ago. </p> <p>It's exactly what women's football needs to continue to thrive in this country - for players, right down to amateur level, to stop picking their way over financial obstacles and be able to concentrate on the football. </p> <p>Almost 150 years ago Sheffield FC set the example that others would follow. Let's hope they're about to do it again.</p>",
  "<p>The weather should be making more news as searing heat, torrential storms and floods make strange changes all over Europe. Yet the climate remains an also-ran in political priorities. </p> <p>Whimsical weather forecasters smile blandly through this most catastrophic news, as if nice weather for ducks and a good day at Lord's was all that was at stake. They could turn themselves into news heroes reporting from the most important battlefront of all: the chief scientist warns that global warming is a far graver danger than the rare episodes of terrorism that preoccupy the west. </p> <p>This week, the Commons environmental audit committee warns that the government is unlikely to hit its target for cutting carbon emissions by 10% by 2010, let alone 20% by 2020. Energy minister Stephen Timms says although the targets are tight they are still \"achievable\" - if only more action is taken. These targets are beyond what Kyoto requires - but even so, they are pathetically modest given the unfolding climate cataclysm. </p> <p>That word \"cataclysm\" will have pencils sharpening among the usual handful of professional climate-change deniers, either flat-earthers or paid agents of various energy interests, with their plausible myths and factoids at the ready. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the anti-wind farm campaign pours out torrents of falsehood about the ineffectiveness of wind energy. Some of it is nimbyism, some of it is semi-covert lobbying by the nuclear industry for a return to their glory days of colossal state subsidy. But whatever they may claim, wind power remains the one major renewable energy source currently viable on any scale, though wave and solar power will soon catch up. Even if building more nuclear power stations was the best option, they couldn't start generating for over 10 years - so wind would still be the right answer now. </p> <p>Campaigners call the turbines an eyesore, but polls show public opinion strongly favours them - and they like them better the closer they live to them. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the gentle turning of these silent white wings delights more people than it offends. </p> <p>The wind controversy is at last making climate change party political. There is now a sharp dividing line between the two main political parties. Michael Howard has said the Tories would make planning permission for wind turbines far more difficult. A planned wind farm in Romney Marsh in his Folkstone constituency has a small but vocal opposition. Undeterred, or possibly spurred on by that, this week John Prescott boldly issued guidelines - in effect instructions - to local authorities to speed up wind-farm planning permission, currently often blocked for a year. </p> <p>The wind farm objectors are a microcosm of the Conservative party - small, selfish and short-sighted, but noisily influential through the unrepresentative Tory press, commanding attention disproportionate to their support. So it is no surprise to read the breathless Sunday Telegraph front page: \"The Telegraph can reveal that Prince Charles has told senior aides that he wants no links with events or groups that promise onshore windfarms.\" He calls them \"a horrendous blot on the landscape\" and is considering coming out against them in public. </p> <p>How unsurprising that the prince joins Country Life and the Telegraph's nimby campaign against wind farms, in the company of Noel Edmonds, David Bellamy (Referendum party, now Tory) and Bernard Ingham of the nuclear lobby. If only there were space here to give the full heartrending succession of Telegraph wind-farm sob stories, such as Anne Hassan-Hicks, who fears her 18th-century house in Tennyson country may lose \u00a3100,000 in value as it looks on to farmland due to sprout wind turbines. Or the bizarre campaign against a wind farm far out to sea off Hinkley Point, already blighted by a huge nuclear power station, in which the landowner renting out the site, Lady Gass, is accused of \"selling her birthright\". </p> <p>The \"countryside\" as a surrogate for the Conservatives is increasing its breadth and range of issues with which to attack Labour. But Howard is hitching a hayride to nowhere in this Country Life upper-class pastoral idyll. In a profoundly urban nation, here is the Tory party retreating to its last bastions in the shires, losing all touch with reality in the comforting embrace of lord lieutenants, masters of foxhounds and old-time Telegraph squiredom. </p> <p>Behind all this silliness is the more sinister backing of the nuclear lobby. Officially, in 2006 the government will review the decision not to build more nuclear power stations. They are right to keep every option open, since global warming is a far more terrible certainty than the future risk of nuclear waste leaking out or the present danger that a terrorist will fly into a nuclear station. Several nuclear disasters would still kill fewer humans than letting global warming rip at this accelerating rate. Serious climate predictions now include horrors such as the drying up of the Mekong, Ganges and Yangtze within 40 years, mass starvation leading to global war for survival, with nuclear weapons. So no option gets ruled out. </p> <p>But unless the economics change radically, nuclear power is by far the most expensive option as well as the least popular, once waste storage and decommissioning costs are included. If anyone finds anything cheaper and better than wind, the turbines can be dismantled, no damage done. Although the US is encouraging others to build nuclear stations, not one has been built in America for 25 years, and most of Europe is pledged to remove them. What's more, no commercial bidders want to build new stations here: Britain's two nuclear \"companies\" are being subsidised by the state to the tune of \u00a32m a day. Carbon sequestration is the other option - burying carbon gases in the empty caverns left by North Sea oil and gas extraction - but that risks encouraging short-term complacency about developing alternatives to fossil fuel burning. </p> <p>Oil price rises this week are described in tones of horror on the business pages, yet they may be the road to salvation. The higher they rise, the cheaper alternative energy supplies are to develop. What irony if oilman Bush's Middle East warsparks the great step forward into renewables. Wave power has huge potential. So do solar panels - the solar roof of a terrace house in London is pumping more energy into the grid per year than it takes out. The set-up costs take years to recoup, but that investment looks good as energy prices rise. </p> <p>Higher taxes for those who use energy extravagantly must also drive the push towards making renewables cost-effective. The Commons committee lays it on the line. (It can be done in ways that ensure the poor aren't penalised.) Labour has backed off when the going got tough, so since 1997 the cost of motoring has fallen, while the price of buses and trains has risen, relative to disposable incomes. </p> <p>But for now, the politics of climate change has settled on the wind-power dispute. Yesterday the Environment Agency warned extreme weather would worsen unless more action is taken.

  "Willy Russell and Tim Firth, writers who between them are responsible for the films Educating Rita, Shirley Valentine and Calendar Girls, will today announce a new playwrights' award for the Edinburgh Fringe. <p>Their award is an attempt to compensate for lack of government support for playwriting. Russell said, recalling his first Edinburgh show 30 years ago: \"It was definitely a much more playwright-friendly environment back in the 1970s. </p> <p>\"The Arts Council still had a massive number of supporters in government and the opposition, and there was still the notion that every medium-size town should have a producing theatre. I'd rather have a more benevolent, fully funded Arts Council than do the award, but there we are.\" </p> <p>The gesture also acknowledges the early career leg-up that the Fringe gave both writers. Russell said: \"In 1972, I blagged, begged and borrowed until I had enough - just enough - to produce my first Edinburgh show. Without the faith of those who invested in a very fledgling talent I might have eked out my years as the worst hairdresser in the world. In helping to set up this award I'm hoping help real writing talent to emerge.\" </p> <p>Firth's first show at Edinburgh, Hexen, a play about witchcraft in Cheshire, was directed on the Fringe two decades ago by Sam Mendes. </p> <p>The winner of the award will be given \u00a35,000 towards staging an outstanding piece of new writing at next year's Fringe, chosen by a panel including Russell and Firth, who have returned to Edinburgh this year with a double-act called The Singing Playwrights. </p> <p>The award joins a number of prizes at the Fringe. Last year's festival featured as many as 13 separate awards, including the Perrier Comedy award, the Scotsman Fringe Firsts and the Stage Awards for Acting Excellence. In such a crowded arena, some of the awards will inevitably fade from the public consciousness. But Russell said: \"In the absence of a sympathetic central government, there is a need for this sort of award.\" </p> <p>The Fringe director, Paul Gudgin, said he felt the new award could help raise the profile of theatre in a landscape dominated by stand-up comedy, with the Perrier award casting a long shadow: \"The prizes I am keen to support are those with a proper, tangible benefit for the winner. Tim's and Willy's should give a fantastic leg-up for a new playwright. Maybe it's time for theatre to kick back against the dominance of the Perrier.\" </p> <p>Opinion remains divided on the virtue of the Perrier. Nica Burns, the organiser of the prize, said: \"Comedy is a part of the entertainment industry not taken as seriously as, say, theatre or dance. The only time that the spotlight falls on comedy is during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The Perrier has been very much part of that: it has been a peg to hang discussion from.\" </p> <p>The history of the Perrier, she suggests, has been intimately linked with the rise and rise of comedy at the Fringe. \"The Perrier started in the year that alternative comedy was officially born: 1981. Then there were only 30 eligible shows; now there are 250.\" There are those, though, who think that comedy has now risen to a level of unhealthy domination. </p> <p>It is also questionable whether truly innovative work is ever capable of being spotted by an awards panel, which will necessarily be decided by majority vote or consensus, arguably brushing away work that is too knotty or novel to immediately appeal. </p> <p>But Joyce McMillan, the theatre critic of the Scotsman, which is behind the Fringe Firsts awards, is a staunch defender of the culture of prizes at the Fringe. </p> <p>\"I am a great fan of awards,\" she said. \"They perform a great civic function and provide a focus for discussion. They also give people something to strive for. From the audience's point of view, they give people a sense of shape of this enormous event.\" </p> <p>The Fringe Firsts, set up to encourage people to premiere theatre work in Edinburgh, \"have been instrumental in maintaining good new work on the Fringe\", she said.</p>",
  "On a balmy spring evening in Lisbon Tony Blair set in motion the events that led to yesterday's appointment of Peter Mandelson as one of the EU's senior political figures. <p>Over dinner in the ornate splendour of the Pestana Palace Hotel he told Jose Manuel Barroso that he would be delighted to see him become president of the European commission.</p> <p>As he flew off in the early hours of the following morning for his historic \"tent\" summit with Colonel Muammar Gadafy, the prime minister had no idea that his closest political ally would land one of the most significant EU jobs five months later.</p> <p>But the warmth of his encounter with Mr Barroso put Britain at an advantage when commission jobs were being handed out.</p> <p>\"It is one of the most important posts in the new commission,\" Denis MacShane, the Europe minister said. \"The anti-Europeans in London do not understand the extent to which Britain is seen as a major European nation again after the years of Tory isolationism.\"</p> <p>The former trade commissioner Lord Brittan who, like Mr Mandelson, served as trade and industry secretary before moving to Brussels, said: \"Frankly it is more important than most cabinet jobs. You are negotiating on behalf of the EU with the USA, Japan, China and the WTO.\"</p> <p>Such a prominent post, involving a lot of travel, will force Mr Mandelson to make a decisive break with British politics, at least for the next five years.</p> <p>In the run-up to next year's general election, when Mr Blair would be expected to turn to his old friend for candid political advice, Mr Mandelson will be immersed in trade negotiations.</p> <p> Most Labour MPs, who have despaired at the continuing influence of Mr Mandelson, will be delighted to see the back of such a prickly figure.</p> <p>But Mr Mandelson is delighted to have secured the trade portfolio - with international competitiveness thrown in for good measure - which will force him to forge a political identity in his own right.</p> <p>In his three ministerial posts in Labour's first term, Mr Mandelson was seen as Tony Blair's enforcer.</p> <p>Hearing his soft, and at times slightly menacing, voice on the phone signalled to ministers that a prime ministerial decree was being issued.</p> <p>In Brussels and the world capitals where he will negotiate Europe's trade deals Mr Mandelson's closeness to Mr Blair will still count.</p> <p>But it will not be enough on its own, and he will need to establish new alliances.</p> <p>Neil Kinnock, one of Britain's outgoing commissioners, who hired Mr Mandelson as Labour communications director in the 1980s, is understood to fear that he will have difficulty fitting in with the commission's consensual style.</p> <p>But one friend said Mr Mandelson was well placed for networking in Europe and beyond. \"Peter's Policy Network outfit has kept him in touch with senior European figures and the Clinton people,\" an ally said.</p> <p>\"He has walk-in rights all over the US, in a way that some of the other Europeans haven't. He is seen as a very, very serious figure.\"</p> <p>While his Labour enemies will happily wave farewell to Mr Mandelson when he takes the Eurostar to Brussels, they may find that his influence on British politics remains as strong as ever.</p> <p>As a member of Mr Barroso's inner team pushing through economic reforms - the \"Lisbon agenda\"- he will play a decisive role in trying to meet Gordon Brown's \"sixth test\" for British membership of the euro.</p> <p>The chancellor has said Britain cannot contemplate joining until Europe reforms its hidebound economies.</p> <p>\"If I were prime minister I would be very pleased with this appointment,\" Lord Brittan said waspishly.</p> <p><b>The stars of the show</b></p> <p><b> ****</b><br> <b>Jose Manuel Barroso (president)</b> <br>Ex-Maoist, centre-right former Portuguese prime minister</p> <p><b>***</b> <br><b>Peter Mandelson (trade)</b><br> Key Blair ally, will have role in pushing economic reform</p> <p><b> Neelie Kroes-Smit (competition)</b><br> Dutch transport expert who will have to drop directorships</p> <p><b> Charlie McCreevy (internal market)</b><br> Domestically unpopular former Irish finance minister</p> <p><b>G\u00fcnter Verheugen (vice-president, enterprise and industry)</b><br> Close ally of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der</p> <p><b> Joaqu\u00edn Almunia (economic and monetary affairs)</b><br>Spanish socialist</p> <p><b>**</b><br> <b>Jacques Barrot (vice-president, transport) </b><br> French centre-right minister, will have to pacify unions</p> <p><b> Margot Wallstr\u00f6m (vice-president, institutional relations and communication)</b><br> Tipped as future Swedish PM</p> <p><b>Danuta Huebner (regional policy)</b><br> Polish free-market economist</p> <p><b> Siim Kallas (vice-president, audit and anti-fraud)</b><br> Ex Estonia prime minister, popular with Blair<br></p> <p><b>Joe Borg (fisheries and maritime affairs)</b><br> Malta's former foreign affairs minister</p> <p><b>Dalia Grybauskaite (financial programming and budget)</b><br> Former minister of finance</p> <p><b>Louis Michel (development) </b><br> Former Belgian foreign minister, annoyed US over Iraq</p> <p><b>Ollie Rehn (enlargement) </b><br> Finnish superbrain, youngest commissioner</p> <p><b>Mariann Fischer Boel (agriculture)</b><br> Danish farm minister, family of landowners<br><br> <b>Benita Ferrero-Waldner (external relations)</b><br> Aristocratic Austrian</p> <p><b>Vladimir Spidla (employment and social affairs)</b><br> Former Czech prime minister, with limited English </p> <p><b>Ingrida Udre (taxation and customs union) </b><br> Former speaker of Latvia's parliament and fan of the game of basketball</p> <p><b> Rocco Buttiglione (vice-president, justice, freedom and security)</b><br> Will deal with asylum issues</p> <p><b>*</b></p> <p><b>Vivian Reding (information society and media)</b><br> Bouffanted Luxembourger, Cannes film festival-goer </p> <p><b>Stavros Dimas (environment) </b><br> Greek free market economist</p> <p><b> Janez Potocnik (science and research) </b><br> Former Slovenian Europe minister</p> <p><b>Jan Figel (education, training and culture)</b><br> Former Slovakian chief negotiator of entry to the EU</p> <p><b> Markos Kyprinaou (health and consumer protection)</b><br> Cypriot lawyer and ex-finance minister</p> <p><b> Laszlo Kovasc (energy)</b><br> 65-year-old former Hungarian foreign minister </p> <p><b>* Stars denote relative importance</b></p>",
  "Increasing numbers of people, especially the young, seem disconnected from an electoral process which, they feel, does not represent them. This is part of a general cynicism about every aspect of public life. <p>Venezuela has many problems, but this is not one of them. Its big trouble - but also its great possibility - is that it has oil; it is the fifth largest exporter. The US depends on it and thus wants control over it. But the Venezuelan government needs the oil revenue, which US multinationals (among others) siphoned off for decades, for its efforts to abolish poverty. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was elected to do just that in 1998, despite almost all of the media campaigning against him. </p> <p>Participation in politics especially at the grassroots has skyrocketed. A new constitution was passed with more than 70% of the vote, and there have been several elections to ratify various aspects of the government's programme. Even government opponents who had organised a coup in 2002 (it failed) have now resorted to the ballot, collecting 2.4 million signatures - many of them suspect - to trigger a referendum against President Ch\u00e1vez, which will be held on Sunday. </p> <p>For Venezuela's participatory democracy, which works from the bottom up, the ballot is only a first step. People represent themselves rather than wait to be represented by others, traditionally of a higher class and lighter skin. Working-class sectors, usually the least active, are now centrally involved. </p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has based himself on this pueblo protag\u00f3nico - the grassroots as protagonists. He knows that the changes he was elected to make can only be achieved with, and protected by, popular participation. </p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has understood the potential power of women as primary carers. Four months of continuous lobbying got women the constitution they wanted. Among its anti-sexist, anti-racist provisions, it recognises women's unwaged caring work as economically productive, entitling housewives to social security. No surprise then that in 2002 women of African and indigenous descent led the millions who descended from the hills to reverse the coup (by a mainly white elite and the CIA), thereby saving their constitution, their president, their democracy, their revolution. </p> <p>In a country where 65% of households are headed by women, it is they who are the majority in government education and health campaigns: who are users as well as those who nurse, train and educate. Again, women are the majority in the land, water and health committees which sort out how the millions of people who built homes on squatted land can be given ownership, how water supplies are to be improved, and what health care is needed. </p> <p>Despite oil, 80% of Venezuelan people are poor, and the Women's Development Bank (Banmujer) is needed to move the bottom up. Unlike other micro-credit banks, such as the Grameen in Bangladesh, its interest rates are government-subsidised. Banmujer, \"the different bank\", is based on developing cooperation among women. Credits can only be obtained if women get together to work out a project which is both viable and what the local community wants and needs. </p> <p>As Banmujer president Nora Casta\u00f1eda explains: \"We are building an economy at the service of human beings, not human beings at the service of the economy. And since 70% of the world's poor are women, women must be central to economic change to eliminate poverty.\" </p> <p>In this oil-producing country 65% of basic food is imported. President Ch\u00e1vez has placed much emphasis on regenerating agriculture and repopulating the countryside, so that Venezuelans can feed themselves and are no longer dependent on imports or vulnerable to blockades which could starve them out. After all, you can't drink oil. </p> <p>Most importantly, the oil revenue is increasingly used for social programmes as well as agriculture: to enable change in the lives of the most who have least. People feel that the oil industry, nationalised decades ago, is finally theirs. The oil workers have created committees to work out how the industry is to be run and for whose benefit, even what to do about the pollution their product causes. The government has turned the referendum, regarded by Venezuelans as an imperialist attempt to oust Ch\u00e1vez, into an even wider expression of the popular will. The small electoral squads, again mainly women who know the community and whom the community knows, are checking identity cards to weed out the names of those who have died or are under age, and register all who are entitled to vote, so that this time there will be little opportunity for electoral fraud. The turnout is expected to be 85%. Some, especially the well-off, see the political engagement of the whole population as a threat to the status quo. Exactly. But since, increasingly, people find representative government doesn't represent them, it may be the wave of the present. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Selma James coordinates the Global Women's Strike; she will be one of the international observers at Sunday's Venezuelan referendum<br> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Dell, the world's largest personal computer maker, posted a higher quarterly profit, in contrast to a profit warning from its rival Hewlett-Packard issued hours earlier yesterday. </p> <p>The Texas-based company said net income for the second quarter rose to $799m (\u00a3434m) from $621m a year earlier. </p> <p>The market had been awaiting Dell's profit report after HP shocked Wall Street by releasing earnings much lower than expected. HP also gave a weak forecast. </p> <p>\"In a slower growth environment, like the one we are going into - an environment where component prices decline - Dell will take share from HP,\" said Marty Shagrin, an analyst with money management firm Victory Capital. </p> <p>Dell, which does not hold an inventory and sells directly to customers instead of through stores, benefits when component prices fall, as it can pass on the savings to customers, slashing prices faster than its rivals.</p>",
  "Spain's 50-year-old bonanza of \"sun, sea and sangria\" package tourism has gone into what experts warn is irreversible decline, taking with it a great British institution, as hotel rooms go begging up and down the country's Mediterranean coast this summer. <p>Hotel-building has ground to a halt in many resorts while older hotels on the Balearic islands, including Majorca, are waiting for permission to be gutted, turned into blocks of flats and sold off. </p> <p>\"If someone tried to give me a hotel now I wouldn't want it, unless I knew I could sell the thing,\" Jaume Moll, a tourism millionaire on Majorca told El Pa\u00eds newspaper this week. </p> <p>With the Majorcan resort of Calvi \u00e0 leading the way by tearing down its worst hotels, experts now warn that the only way to stop the package tourism rot will be to cull up to 30% of hotels in some Spanish resorts. </p> <p>Almost 5% fewer package tourists arrived in Spain in the early part of this season compared with last year, while tourism in most of the world is booming, according to the Spanish lobby group Exceltur. </p> <p><b>Competition</b><br>\"It is a model that is exhausted and in difficulties,\" Spain's tourism minister, Jos\u00e9 Montilla, admitted recently. </p> <p>The traditional costa package holiday, immortalised by Carry On films and a generation of stand-up comics, was invented in the 1950s when former warplanes transported ration-weary Britons to what were then small, quaint fishing villages on the Costa Brava. </p> <p>The package holiday fed a tourism boom that saw the 2 million visitors who discovered virgin Spanish beaches and the dangers of all-over sunburn in 1956 become 17 million within a decade and close to 50 million within 30 years. </p> <p>As the season hits its highest point this week, however, even four-star hotels in Marbella, the most expensive spot on the Costa del Sol, have been advertising accommodation at \u20ac65 (\u00a340) a night, while similar Costa Brava hotels are reportedly asking \u20ac45. </p> <p>At Malaga airport one major hotel chain, Sol Melia, is advertising bed and breakfast for \u20ac48 a night. </p> <p>Competition for the traditional costa package is coming from cheaper, rival resorts elsewhere and from the holiday homes being bought, and then let via the internet or lent to friends, by British and other owners. </p> <p>Britons are estimated to be buying 100,000 holiday homes a year, while 80,000 more are going to other nationalities. </p> <p>At Malaga airport earlier this week there were more estate agents greeting morning arrivals, many stepping off self-booked budget flights rather than charter airlines, than tour reps. </p> <p>\"Some people go to the villa, stock up at the supermarket, switch on Sky television and do not leave for the next two weeks,\" explained Ann Taylor, a Costa del Sol property saleswoman. </p> <p>\"The housing is spreading all the way along the coast and even up into the hills,\" she added. </p> <p>The change has alarmed Spanish hotel owners, who are demanding action against internet lets or private deals where money and, especially, taxes may never reach Spain. </p> <p>\"It is very important that the authorities take firm measures to make sure there is not illegal accommodation on offer,\" said Sim\u00f3n Pedro Barcel\u00f3, co-chairman of one of Spain's largest tourism companies, Barcelo. </p> <p>Up to a third of tourists arriving at some resorts now arrange their own villas or apartments. </p> <p>Years of familiarity with Spanish airports, car hire companies and roads also mean many travellers no longer need trips laid on by tour companies or travel agencies, said Mr Barcel\u00f3. </p> <p>\"We've been coming here for several years and now I just go on to the internet to look for something. Usually it belongs to someone in England and we might pay them there,\" said Tina O'Loughlin, from Wirral, as she and her husband, James, took their daughter Charlotte, aged seven, to a Marbella beach yesterday. </p> <p>Choked roads, packed beaches and shoddy 1970s hotels have all contributed to the flight of tourists to other places. </p> <p>A four-mile tailback on the coastal road out of Marbella yesterday was proof that the costas' infrastructure cannot always handle so many visitors. </p> <p>Hotel owners blame greedy Spanish restaurant and bar owners, and those with licences to rent out overpriced sun-loungers on the beaches, for driving tourists away. </p> <p>While the costas struggle to hold on to package tourists, their booming, cheaper and less-crowded rivals in countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt and Croatia enjoy annual growth rates of up to 50%. </p> <p>They now jointly attract more than 60 million tourists a year, compared with Spain's 52 million. </p> <p>Spain, meanwhile, expects just 1-2% growth in visitor numbers this year but an overall drop in tourism income as prices are forced down and people spend less time and less money in the country. </p> <p>The number of foreigners occupying hotel beds in the Balearic islands, Andalucia and the Canaries fell by between 6.7% and 10.2% in April and May. </p> <p>Exceltur predicts that \u20ac263m (\u00a3175m) of package tourist cash will be lost this year. </p> <p>In a country which is considered a tourism superpower, and where tourism accounts for 12% of the economy, the crisis is a major worry. </p> <p>Larger Spanish tourism companies became global players years ago, developing alternative resorts around the world, but Mr Barcel\u00f3 said that Spain itself must now offer quality hotels and more than just beaches, bars and restaurants. </p> <p>\"I don't think anybody will be getting rid of five-star hotels,\" he said. </p> <p>A newspaper columnist, Enric Llarch, says that hotel owners, whose properties may open only four or five months a year, have had it too easy for too long. </p> <p>\"A large proportion have limited themselves to squeezing the tourist lemon,\" he wrote in La Vanguardia newspaper earlier this week. </p> <p>This week's terrorist attacks on tourist hotels in Turkey were thought likely to encourage last-minute holiday buyers to turn back to Spain. </p> <p>In any case, said Mr Barcel\u00f3, the decline of package tourism does not mean the British, and northern European, love affair with Spain is over. </p> <p>\"Tourism is a living, changing phenomenon,\" he said. \"Our growth opportunities are not so much in sea and sunshine but in the interior, in our cities, and in offering things like culture, health and beauty.\" </p> <p><b>The holiday budget</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Amount by which package holiday market to Spain is thought to have fallen this year: <br>20%<br></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Spain's receipts from British visitors in 2003:<br> \u00a35bn<br></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Percentage of Spain's 2003 GNP accounted for by tourism: 12% Number of Spaniards working in tourism:<br> 1.5m<br></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Number of second homes being built annually in Spain: <br>180,000<br></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Percentage of those homes being built for Britons: <br>40%<br></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b><b>Isabelle Chevallot </b></p>"
