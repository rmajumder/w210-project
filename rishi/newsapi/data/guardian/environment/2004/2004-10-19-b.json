  "<p>This is not the kind of suspense to make nerve ends crackle at Anfield. No one is galvanised by the recognition that Liverpool could as easily finish bottom of Group A as win it. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's team, with a single home fixture left, are now two points behind the Monaco club whom they overcame so easily last month. </p> <p>Whether one looks at Europe or the Premiership, the prospects remain obscure. Liverpool's manager is instilling his methods and there were periods of domination over a lacklustre Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a but Ben\u00edtez's side could not capitalise on the good fortune that implored them to put the ball in the net. </p> <p>Despite the \u00a314.1m Djibril Ciss\u00e9, who bridled at his eventual substitution, the prospect of new investment at Liverpool will be seen by the fans primarily as a means to secure a top-class striker. Any newcomer dropped into the scene, though, would be crash-landing in a stressful environment. </p> <p>Liverpool are the one English side to have lost a match in this season's Champions League. The squad is thin and so, too, is the confidence of the players. The syndrome was apparent in Milan Baros and the golden boot winner of Euro 2004 turned into the ditherer of Anfield after 28 minutes. </p> <p>The build-up was unusually acute as Ciss\u00e9 made a slippery turn and Dietmar Hamann's pass sprang the offside trap for the Czech attacker. After rounding the goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Molina, though, Baros still wanted to check his position and so gave hope to Manuel Pablo, who made one of several good challenges. </p> <p>Despite the involvement of the two forwards in that move, the suspicion is great that Ciss\u00e9 and Baros are alternatives rather than partners. It says much for the magnanimity of the audience that there were cheers for the news of Michael Owen's first goal for Real Madrid rather than curses at the loss of his talent. </p> <p>Not even Deportivo's vulnerability could provoke Liverpool to ruthlessness. There were lengthy passages of authority in midfield but the passing could not turn into a chain reaction, while the attackers failed to pierce the Deportivo back four regularly enough. </p> <p>Javier Irureta's team stay bottom of the group and it was easy to spot that they dread elimination from the Champions League. By and large, though, it was pieces of good fortune that invited Liverpool to put the visitors out of their misery. </p> <p>The ball ran kindly to Ciss\u00e9 after a run by Luis Garcia in the 19th minute but the alert Manuel Pablo came up with a tackle before the Frenchman could produce a shot. Eleven minutes before the interval a ricochet again cosseted Liverpool as Xabi Alonso's shot deflected to Luis Garcia only for his unsatisfactory finish to be tipped over by Molina. </p> <p>The goalkeeper had earlier parried a drive that Ciss\u00e9 hit on the turn from a Garcia cut-back. Preoccupied as Liverpool are with the problem of rejoining the elite, they should have made short work of Deportivo, as Monaco had done. </p> <p>The little that last season's semi-finalists had to offer could have hurt Liverpool, however. After quarter of an hour Alberto Luque's corner was met by the brow of Cesar and John Arne Riise had to react well to head off the line at the far post. </p> <p>Anfield is, nonetheless, still a reservoir of trust and faith where fans, well aware of a heritage frittered, still see encouragement as the starting point of resurgence. These are lucky players, whose good intentions get cheered as if they were solid achievements. </p> <p>Liverpool were at least to manoeuvre more confidently once their path was smoothed by the injury that ensured the substitution of Deportivo's World Cup winner Mauro Silva. </p> <p>The revivalist mood, however, had still not reached the strikers and it was the unambitious Deportivo who had the first good chance following the interval. After an hour Victor put an inswinging cross behind the defence and, if the rushing Juan Carlos Valeron could have made solid contact, Liverpool would have been behind. </p> <p>Something had to change, with Ben\u00edtez's forwards waning to the extent that the manager even preferred to replace Ciss\u00e9 with the midfielder-cum-full-back, Steve Finnan. In an increasingly fragmented fixture the team were looking for a scrap of luck. </p> <p>Anfield was eventually reduced to hoping that Anders Frisk would send off one of the Deportivo players who had already been booked. All that angry beseeching was further proof that Liverpool, at present, cannot be the masters of their own fate. </p>",
  "<p>The price of oil hit record highs yesterday amid signs it is encouraging the energy industry to move into previously shunned areas for exploration such as Peru. </p> <p>American crude reached $55.33 per barrel on the global market but then slumped 3% as traders took profits after evidence emerged that high energy costs are taking their toll on economic growth. Brent crude in London fell $1.46 to $48.86. </p> <p>Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had warned last Friday that increased oil prices had made a \"notable\" impact on US gross domestic product. </p> <p>Fears about growing winter demand encouraged the price of crude to rise yesterday to $55 - $11 higher than in the middle of last month. </p> <p>US production in the Gulf of Mexico is still less than 75% of its normal rate because pipelines and platforms have been damaged by storms such as Hurricanes Ivan and Charley which have repeatedly hit the area recently. This has prevented refiners building up supplies ahead of the winter. </p> <p>The continued high price of crude - and predictions it could stay at these levels for some time to come - has encouraged the majors to spend much more on exploration and production. </p> <p>It has also triggered interest in countries previously shunned for their political risk profile or questionable geography. </p> <p>Gold Oil, a tiny new Aim-listed company, yesterday revealed it was the latest foreign firm to sign an agreement with PeruPetro, the state owned oil group in Lima. </p> <p>Gold, formed in July, has been given a huge swath of acreage in the Sechura Basin in the north of the country. </p> <p>It has got permission to evaluate the region - the size of 14 North Sea blocks - but then turn it into a formal exploration contract. </p> <p>Gold believes it can find oil or gas in this desert area and has signed a memorandum of understanding with MAN Ferrostaal of Germany to see whether a petrochemical plant could be constructed in northern Peru. </p> <p>The government has been struggling to entice foreign firms to join the search for oil and gas. </p> <p>It has made the terms for engagement more attractive and Occidental Petroleum recently signed up to explore in the east of the country. </p> <p>American group Hunt Oil also recently won environmental approval to build a gas liquefaction plant in Peru. </p> <p>Another poor Latin American country - Bolivia - has also been attracting more interest from western energy companies over recent months.</p>",
  "<p>The two top US toymakers posted disappointing third-quarter results yesterday, citing uncertainty in the economy and cautious retailers, and tempered expectations for the festive season. </p> <p>Number one toymaker Mattel said third-quarter earnings slid 5% from a year ago, with overall sales down 2%. Sales of Barbie dolls dropped 26%. </p> <p>Hasbro posted higher earnings as it cut costs, but the results were weaker than expected with revenue down 2% as sales of its once-hot Beyblade continued falling. </p> <p>Both toymakers said the retail environment remained \"challenging\". </p> <p>\"We are currently dealing with broad consumer uncertainty related to higher gasoline prices and a lacklustre employment picture which translates into uninspiring consumer confidence levels,\" Mattel's chief executive, Robert Eckert, said on a conference call. </p> <p>Most retailers are deciding shelf space based on their past performance and seeking to \"chase demand\" rather than take goods early.</p>",
  "<p>The famous \"night mail\" will be back on the railways this Christmas after a climbdown by Royal Mail, which caused fury last year by announcing it would stop using rail freight. </p> <p>In a deal that has delighted trade unions and environmentalists, Royal Mail has signed a trial contract with GB Railfreight to run four daily rail services between London and Scotland during December. </p> <p>An industry source said Royal Mail would pay about \u00a3750,000 for the services, which will carry 4% of Britain's festive postbag. </p> <p>Two of the daily trains will continue until March, when Royal Mail will \"assess whether they add service improvements\" to its mixture of lorries and aircraft. </p> <p>GB Railfreight will take over the mail trains from its larger rival EWS, which claimed last year that Royal Mail's withdrawal had forced it to shed 500 jobs in a restructuring. </p> <p>Royal Mail's chief executive, Adam Crozier, said: \"GB Railfreight has come up with a commercially acceptable rail option, based on price - something which could not be offered by our previous supplier.\" </p> <p>The last mail train ran in June, following a shake-up of logistics which Royal Mail said would save it \u00a390m. Critics said the reorganisation would involve 160,000 extra lorry journeys annually and flew in the face of the government's aim of shifting goods from road to rail. </p> <p>Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the TSSA transport union, said: \"This is a victory for common sense and we are delighted. Ongoing pressure from trade unions and the success of our 'save mail on rail' campaign has brought the issue to the fore and forced Royal Mail to rethink.\" </p> <p>Last year's changes were supposed to improve the efficiency of Royal Mail's network. But the publicly owned organisation subsequently failed 15 delivery targets set by its regulator, Postcomm. </p> <p>Royal Mail revealed last month that its logistics director, Paul Bateson, who oversaw the shake-up, was leaving its executive board. </p> <p>Correspondence leaked to the Guardian last year revealed disquiet in ministerial circles about the end of Britain's 174-year-old network of mail trains. In a letter to the RMT rail union, environment minister Lord Whitty said: \"I personally, and this department also, have grave concerns about the Royal Mail decision, which seems to be heading in the opposite direction from the aim of a more balanced, environmentally friendly and integrated transport system.\"</p>",
  "Lynne Stewart has been coming to court 110 in Manhattan's federal district court almost every weekday since mid-June. As a practicing defence lawyer with a long career representing unpopular and politically radical defendants, including members of the infamous Weather Underground, she knows the building and its imposing atmosphere of jurisprudence well. <p>This time, though, her position here is different. She's in the dock as the accused. </p> <p>In late 2002, in a well-crafted display of television showmanship, attorney general John Ashcroft himself came to New York to announce the arrest of 65-year-old Stewart and her co-defendants, a Staten Island taxi driver named Mohamed Yousry and a legal aide, Ahmed Abdel Sattar, on charges of conspiracy and abetting terrorism. </p> <p>Specifically, Ashcroft's prosecutors accused Stewart of helping to pass messages from her most prominent client, the imprisoned blind Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman to his spiritual followers in the Islamic Group, an Egyptian fundamentalist group held responsible for deadly attacks on western tourists. </p> <p>To the Justice Department, the case is proof that it is fighting hard against the forces of terrorism. Abdel Rahman, after all, had been convicted of plotting to blow up Manhattan's bridges and tunnels in 1995, and inciting followers to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and carry out the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. The sheik, currently held in the super-max prison in Florence, Colorado is considered a special threat by the US authorities. </p> <p>Stewart represented him at trial and through his appeal process. Since his conviction he's been held in solitary confinement and has been barred from communicating with anyone but his immediate family and lawyers. The government alleged that Stewart passed the message that the sheik had withdrawn his support for a ceasefire between terrorist followers and the Egyptian government. </p> <p>Stewart does not deny that she passed the message. She called a Reuters reporter in Cairo to tell the news agency that the sheik did not support the ceasefire. The question at her trial is whether the civil rights veteran intended to aid terrorism or simply give her client the best representation she could. \"She believed it's her duty as a lawyer to stand up for the client, no matter how hated they may be and what they have done,\" her defence lawyer Michael Tigar told the jury at the start of the trial. </p> <p>Further, Stewart's colleagues point out that she is being prosecuted in an atmosphere of paranoia, and the events in question took place in May 2000 when George W Bush and his global war on terror were still in the future. </p> <p>\"The government has proven everything that Lynne Stewart acknowledges she did,\" says her friend and fellow civil rights attorney Ron Kuby. \"She did give the sheik the news of the outside world, and she did communicate his views to news media. The question that remains open is did she do it with the intent of zealously representing her client or did she do it to aid and abet terrorism? </p> <p>\"The argument she aided terrorism is untrue, malicious and wrong, but the accusation she articulated her client's views in public is completely true.\" </p> <p>In their complaint, government prosecutors called Stewart \"an indispensable and active facilitator of the terrorist communication network\", and said her actions were akin to an accomplice in a bank robbery who distracts security guards while others pinch the money. Specifically, the government says Stewart allowed Yousry to communicate with Rahman in Arabic about the ceasefire, and that she purposely made comments in English to mask the Arabic conversation. </p> <p>The evidence was obtained under a warrant that permits the authorities to secretly monitor and tape generally privileged conversations between inmates and their lawyers in terrorist cases. Whether or not Stewart's actions crossed the line of responsibility (she had specifically agreed in writing to the special rules banning the sheik from communicating with anyone but his family and lawyers), the apparent challenge to the relationship between counsel and client has implications for the practice of US criminal law. </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse her of \"calculated conduct\" in the way she abused her rights as a lawyer. For her supporters, and even for many members of the bar who may not approve of her actions, her case sends a clear warning to the legal profession: don't represent accused terrorists or any public enemy or you, too, could become a suspect. Stewart herself says her case is a test. </p> <p>\"This fight is not about the sheikh, let's get that clear,\" she said before her trial. \"This fight is about America. About whether we want to change our system of criminal justice to the extent that nobody - and probably high on that list, the left in this country - can feel secure talking to a lawyer.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the trial is infused with the misgivings that have characterised American life since 9/11. The Bush administration argues that the war on terror justifies the tightening up of civil liberties as part of what Ashcroft calls the \"paradigm of prevention\". Opponents believe that it is a pretext for government to further accrue power and control over the individual. While the case has been brought not under the controversial USA Patriot Act, but under earlier legislation that permits the US to conduct counter-intelligence on people it thinks are engaging in terrorism or secret intelligence activities, the outcome may come to define the limits of what lawyers can do. </p> <p>\"There are so many lawyers already reluctant to take on controversial cases, they will become even more reluctant,\" says Kuby. \"If something this small results in Lynne going to prison for a decade, they're not going to want to take the case.\" </p> <p>While she may not relish being imprisoned, there's no doubt Stewart recognises that she has become, in her words, the \"poster child of Ashcroft's assault on the Bill of Rights.\" Her lawyer, Michael Tigar, who has called the case \"an opportunity to confront the Bush/Cheney/Ashcroft effort to destroy human rights and scare the country into lurching to the right,\" is also a veteran of the left-leaning civil rights circuit whose clients have ranged from the family of the murdered Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier to the Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols. </p> <p>So arduous has the lengthy trial proved for the jury that the judge gave them permission to take longer lunches and to eat outside because they were falling asleep, but it has produced some intriguing moments. In one wire-tapped exchange, Abdel Rahman, his Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry and Stewart are heard wondering if Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens, could be persuaded to join the defence committee. On the tape, the sheik instructs the singer to be added to the list but no one can remember his real, pre-Muslim, name. Yousry suggests he was a Beatle. \"Oh yeah, he was the most famous,\" the sheik concurs in Arabic. </p> <p>Some see Stewart's case as typical of the kind of over-prosecution the justice department under Ashcroft has pursued in the name of domestic security. Under his predecessor, Janet Reno, the department declined the opportunity to prosecute her. </p> <p>Critics of the department say it has been singularly unsuccessful in prosecuting allegedly terrorist-related individuals and plots since 9/11. Of the 301 terrorist convictions the government claims, almost all are for giving \"material support\" and have little directly to do with terrorism. </p> <p>This weekend, a New York Times editorial endorsing John Kerry for president noted that Ashcroft has \"appeared on TV time and again to announce sensational arrests of people who turned out to be either innocent, harmless braggarts or extremely low-level sympathisers of Osama bin Laden who, while perhaps wishing to do something terrible, lacked the means.\" </p> <p>Kuby says: \"The amazing thing about the criminal justice process in America is that none of the schmucks they've been prosecuting poses any danger to anybody.\" </p> <p>The Lackawanna Six, a group of young Muslim men from upstate New York, were effectively prosecuted for sending sleeping bags to the Taliban. \"We may all want the Taliban to be cold and uncomfortable, but the notion that sending them sleeping bags earns you 15 years in prison is striking,\" Kuby says. </p> <p>\"And that is true for almost all of the terrorist prosecutions in the US since 9/11. They have been for bit-players and non-players, prosecuted for obscure and innocuous activities in most cases, none of which that would ordinarily appear on anybody's radar.\" </p> <p>Two weeks ago the case against four Muslim immigrants once accused of having foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks abruptly collapsed in Detroit. In bringing the case, the government had relied on a single informant who prosecutors now concede told them what they wanted to hear in return for having fraud charges against him dropped. Far from being a \"sleeper operational combat cell\", the four seem to have had no links to terrorism and the government has now repudiated its own case, discredited its own witnesses and found fault with virtually every part of its prosecution. </p> <p>In charging the men, a justice department memorandum revealed, prosecutors hoped they would find out what the four were up to. \"We can charge this case with the hope that the case might get better,\" wrote counterterrorism chief Barry Sabin, \"and the certainty that it will not get much worse.\" </p> <p>But as Stewart's lawyer begins presentation of her defence this week, it is unlikely she relishes being the accused. \"It's good to vindicate causes and work to fight injustice,\" says Kuby. \"It's not necessarily desirable to be the cause that people are working to vindicate.\"</p>",
  "<p>The price of gold shone yesterday - up 30 cents to $419.10 per ounce in afternoon trading in London. Traders said the strengthening of the euro against the dollar pushed prices higher. </p> <p>With so much attention focused on rocketing oil prices, the stellar performance of gold and other commodities has often been overlooked.</p> <p>But for the past few years, gold has been a sound investment, notching up price rises of 53% since the start of 2001. And the outlook remains upbeat.</p> <p>Recent economic data from the US has been lacklustre and the rising price of oil could further hamper growth. But a stuttering US economy could be positive for the price of gold. \"There is a negative correlation between the US dollar and the price of gold, so if the dollar begins to devalue, gold is likely to go higher,\" said Bruce Alway of analyst GFMS.</p> <p>But the gold price has not always glistered. At the start of 1999, it tumbled to a seven-year low. One of the key reasons for the market's jittery state was concern over the disposal of part of the reserves held by central banks.</p> <p>Announcements by some banks, such as the Bank of England, to sell off gold reserves caused widespread concern among traders, with fears that bullion could flood on to the market and destabilise the price.</p> <p>In 1999, the banks reached an agreement that specified they would only sell 2,000 tonnes collectively over the next five years.</p> <p>Fears over falling prices subsided and the value of gold began to rally. \"Poorly performing equity markets and a low interest rate environment made investors look elsewhere and gold, like other commodities, benefited,\"Mr Alway said.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Pre-amble</strong> Rafa Benitez's team is bolstered by the return of Spanish wizard Xabi Alonso in place of Salif Diao. Will Harry Kewell start after recovering from an ankle problem? Will he make any difference if he does? Your thoughts please.</p> <p>Deportivo, who have made a pretty dreadful start to the competition all in all, are without Sergio, who's serving a one-match ban. Last season's semi-finalists have good pedigree in this competition; certainly better than Liverpool's in recent years, but Benitez's side will be favourites to take this. Of course that means there's even more pressure on them not to lose, but surely this team of travelling troubadours will respond better to a game against one of Europe's top teams than they might to a stinky cold night in Portsmouth? </p> <p>Looks like Kewell will be warming the bench, along with fellow returnee Steve Finnan. Apart from Alonso it's the same team which conjured the Fulham win out of a box marked 'not very likely' at the weekend. Cisse and Baros start up front, with Alonso and Hamann manning the midfield engine room in the absence of Steven Gerrard. </p> <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Kirkland, Josemi, Hyypia, Carragher, Traore, Luis Garcia, Alonso, Hamann, Riise, Baros, Cisse. Subs: Dudek, Finnan, Kewell, Diao, Sinama Pongolle, Biscan, Warnock. </p> <p><strong>D Coruna: </strong> Molina, Manuel Pablo, Cesar, Andrade, Capdevila, Victor, Mauro Silva, Duscher, Luque, Valeron, Pandiani. Subs: Munua, Romero, Tristan, Fran, Munitis, Scaloni, Pablo Amo. </p> <p><strong>Scouse stereotypes</strong> Apparently the Deportivo team have been delayed by 15 minutes due to the police having to close off an area of Liverpool because of an armed robbery. At this point we would normally make some supposedly witty, if slightly regionalist comment about cultural distinctions in certain parts of the north west. However, following recent GuardianUnlimited guideline changes, we'll just have to satisfy ourselves with a slightly snide snigger. </p> <p><strong>Matters for concern</strong> Could anyone please tell us why we have started writing this minute-by-minute as if there are more than one of us? And while we're at it, where are all your emails? Is it 'cos I is not a witty if slightly misanthropic Irishman?</p> <p>Saul in Pittsburgh asks: \"Are you not a full time employee, or does the Guardian ration e-mail addresses in some kind of 'save the planet' plan?\" You've guessed it Saul, I'm on the lower rungs of the ladder, a pikey freelancer not fit to shine the shoes of Glendenning and co. Then again if I did have a Guardian email I'd have to put up with thousands of emails from pituary retards in the US complaining about the paper's supposedly biased coverage of the US election (ie we occasionally express the sentiment that George Bush may not be a particularly nice man.) </p> <p>So it's not all bad, eh?</p> <p><strong>And they're off</strong> From a free-kick on the left Traore knocks it forward to Cisse who has a free header inside the box. It flies past the left-hand upright. </p> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> Alonso is already causing problems with some incisive passing. Liverpool get their first corner but it flies over everyones' heads and comes to nothing. Emmett Williams in New York writes: \"I have nothing clever nor interesting to write, but you should know that you are being read.\" It's good to know I have some support Emmett. By the way did I say how much I love American people? </p> <p><strong>6 mins</strong> Not a lot happening of note, but Milan Baros is looking sharp and Liverpool have plenty of possession. \"I'm with Paula Willow (see the Man. Utd coverage next door),\" says Robi Polgar, somewhat nonsensically. \"Where's grumpy Barry for our LFC trial? Who are you?\" An imposter, clearly. </p> <p><strong>9mins:</strong> Alberto Luque phaffs about on the left wing and eventually gets himself trapped in amongst two Liverpool players. The ball goes out, Luque complains and ends up with a yellow card. Some more Deportivo pressure down the left however, and things are looking more promising for the Spanish side.</p> <p><strong>12mins</strong> Alonso clips in a free kick from the right, and Cisse connects, but it's way over the bar.</p> <p><strong>13mins</strong> Cisse to Luis Garcia just inside the box but the referee's assistant raises the offside flag.</p> <p><strong>14mins</strong> A Deportivo corner and Hamann completely loses Cesar at the back post. The latter's strong header is headed off the line by Riise. A narrow escape for the home side.</p> <p><strong>23mins</strong> You've missed another good attempt by Cisse after I decided to return this report around after a few peeps complained. Thanks to Alex Hill in LA for pointing out my error.</p> <p><strong>25 mins</strong> Traore to Garcia to Baros on the right, who finds Cisse unmarked in the centre. Molina just about spoons a save. Quick sharp passing from Liverpool and its looking positive right now.</p> <p><strong> 29mins</strong> Hamann through the centre to Baros, who slaloms round Molina but is denied at the end by Manuel Pablo just as the open net awaits. The resulting corner comes to nothing and a second a few moments later is also wasted. \"Based on my theory that footballers with names ending in vowels are generally better than their consonated counterparts, we should be in for a draw,\" says Mark Brownlow in Vienna.\"But if Benitez replaces Baros and Hamann with Diao and Sinama Pongolle, Liverpool should romp to victory.\" Slightly abstract, I have to admit, but it makes a change from all the emails telling me how much better Barry Glendenning is than I am. And no Paula Willow I am not an \"intern\". Harumph!</p> <p><strong>33mins</strong> Another disappointing miss for the Reds. Garcia's strike is palmed behind by Molina and the resulting corner is wasted. Hamann gets a yellow card for a foul on Victor.</p> <p><strong>36mins</strong> An outswinging Garcia corner comes to Riise, whose fine strike hits the crowd of Deportivo players and falls to Baros near the left hand goal post. The angle is too narrow for him to find the goal, however, and Liverpool have still failed to score despite having almost a quarter of an hour of pretty solid pressure.</p> <p><strong>38mins</strong> Jorge Andrade is given a yellow card for a late tackle on Carragher. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has scored his first goal for Real Madrid against Kiev at the Bernabeu; how Liverpool may wish they could still rely on his talents.</p> <p><strong>40mins</strong> Baros through the centre hits another strike narrowly wide of the left-hand upright from just outside the box.</p> <p><strong>43mins</strong> Deportivo have a few moments or possession in Liverpool's half, but they're not getting anywhere near the goal. Liverpool are containing their counter-attacks well, if only they could finish their own forward moves.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Still goalless, but Liverpool look by far the better side. If it hadn't been for a couple of excellent saves by Molina Baros would have had a couple on the scoresheet already. He looks fresh. Cisse, meanwhile, has had his moments, but needs to learn to use his pace to beat opponents to the ball rather than risking being caught offside by trying to grab an extra yard's advantage.</p> <p>\"So what's Barry doing this evening?\" asks Richard Maxey. \"I thought he was contractually obliged to cover all Liverpool games. Does this mean there's half a chance of a decent game tonight?\" It's certainly looking that way, Richard. This is one of the most exciting scoreless games I've seen in a long while. Meanwhile, at least two or three of people have emailed in to say I'm much better than Barry. And only one of them was my mum.</p> <p><strong>46mins</strong> Welcome back, and it's Liverpool straight at it again. Cisse to Garcia, to Baros, who's offside.</p> <p><strong>49mins</strong> Baros is cynically brought down by Cesar whilst on another lively run in dangerous territory and Liverpool have a free-kick from a central position just to the left of the box. Hamann is over it, but his strike is deflected to safety off a Liverpool player for a goal kick.</p> <p><strong>53mins</strong> Luis Garcia looks like he's twisted an ankle. On the touchline Harry Kewell begins to stretch hopefully but that's all he'll be doing for a while if the Liverpool backroom staff have anything to do with it. They want Garcia back on, and no wonder. Apparently over in Spain, Ronaldo has just taken one full in the swingers. Emmett Williams wonders why European sportsmen don't wear boxes to protect themselves from such painful eventualities, when Americans are so keen on them. Ever heard of the phrase \"balls of steel\" Emmett? Besides, the birth rate over here is far too high as it is.</p> <p><strong>56mins</strong> Liverpool are knocking it around nicely from left to right, 10 yards or so back from the box. It's like watching a Reds game from yesteryear, but there's no final ball into the box at the moment, despite the pressure.</p> <p><strong>58mins</strong> Scaloni comes on for Deportivo's Brazilian captain Silva, who's injured.</p> <p><strong>61mins</strong> Valeron almost connects with a curling long pass from the left wing. Deportivo are having their occasional moments and they could still pinch on the counter. \"Do you think Liverpool can take this one? I have seen all of Depos games this season except this one and they have not been the Depo of old (5-1 thrashing by Valencia comes to mind),\" says, umm, someone who hasn't put their name on the email. I reckon so, nameless one, especially as that incredibly good buy HARRY KEWELL IS ABOUT TO COME ON! Yay!</p> <p><strong>65mins</strong> \"Well I must say Barry strangely resembles Rob Lowe!\" writes Andy Myers. Funny you should say that Andy. I believe he has been told that in the past. You'd be amazed at various sportsdesk members' similarities in looks to famous celebrities. Rob Smyth, for instance, is a dead ringer for the young Mark Hamill, he of Star Wars fame, while Georgina Turner bears an uncanny resemblance to Demi Moore. Meanwhile Cisse fluffs another chance from the right hand side of the box, and Alonso tries a Beckham from behind the half way line. The Kop is shouting his name.</p> <p><strong>72mins</strong> A draw here just isn't enough for Liverpool, but Deportivo have been a tighter unit in the second half. Unless the generally ineffective Kewell can conjure something, this is heading for stalemate, because Alonso and Garcia are looking tired.</p> <p><strong>73mins</strong> I only really said that because it's sod's law that one of them will score if I write them off, natually.</p> <p><strong>77mins</strong> Steve Finnan is on for Cisse. Garcia presumably will now push up front with Baros. Cisse is no great loss, to be frank. He's found some nice positions but looked off the pace and lacking confidence, which is little surprise given his three goals in 13 games since arriving.</p> <p><strong>78mins</strong> Alonso to Kewell on the left. The Australian cuts inside and ignores two Liverpool players to his right, choosing to go it alone. His shot to the left post is easily held by Molina.</p> <p><strong>82mins</strong> Kewell skips past a couple of players and wins a throw out on the left. He's actually looking like Liverpool's best hope of creating something effective. </p> <p><strong>85mins</strong> More Kewell mischief down the left. Liverpool have plenty of players in the box. Florent Sinama-Pongolle, on for Garcia goes down under a challenge from Capdevila inside the box but referee Anders Frisk waves away the Liverpool protests. \"I've been watching <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/news/matchreport/0,9752,1330841,00.html\">Smyth's commentary</a> on the MUFC game and I can confirm you are just slightly more entertaining than him,\" writes Mark in Vancouver, one of a number of Canadians who have emailed in, generally slagging off the Americans who've been emailing in. </p> <p><strong>89mins</strong> Andrade should have gone for a second bookable offence after a blatant lunge at Baros, but Frisk won't listen to Liverpool's protests.</p> <p><strong>90mins</strong> A Kewell free-kick from outside the box but the Deportivo wall is too close. Frisk moves the ball forward and a second effort from Kewell flies just wide of the left-hand upright. If that had gone in he might have been (temporarily) forgiven for everything.</p> <p><strong>93mins</strong> With Deportivo putting their feet in, Hamann has a free-kick from 30 yards out, but it's over the bar. Liverpool have done enough to win tonight, but the ball just won't go in the net for them. Baros gets a yellow card for a frustrated tackle on Pablo.</p> <p><strong>Full-time</strong> It ends scoreless and Liverpool will now need to win in Spain or at Monaco to get through the group stages; not something you'd put your money on. Nevertheless it's been an entertaining Anfield evening with the Reds looking stylish and lively. Thanks for all your emails, have a great evening. Ben. P.S. Vote Kerry!</p>",
  "<p>The humanitarian aid group Care International today announced that the British-born head of its Iraqi operation had been kidnapped in Baghdad. </p> <p>Al-Jazeera, the Arabic language news channel, later broadcast a video of Margaret Hassan - an Iraqi national - who was abducted this morning. Ms Hassan had been working for Care in Iraq for more than a decade. </p> <p>The Reuters news agency said the video showed her sitting in a room, looking anxious. No audio could be heard. The station showed close-ups of her identification cards, and said the video had been accompanied by a claim of responsibility from an unnamed Iraqi group. </p> <p>Earlier, a spokesman for Care International confirmed that Ms Hassan, who was employed by Care Australia, had been kidnapped at 7.30am local time (0930 BST) today. Although born in the UK, she has lived in Iraq for 30 years. </p> <p>Spokesman Robert Glasser told Sky News that, as far as the charity knew, Ms Hassan was unharmed. Officials were being careful not to reveal too many details, fearing that could jeopardise Ms Hassan's chances of being released.</p> <p>\"We do want to stress that she is an Iraqi national, not a Briton,\" a Care spokeswoman said. \"We want to stress that she sees herself as an Iraqi. Iraq is her home. She has been living there for many years, and would never consider coming back to Britain.\" </p> <p>Mr Glasser added that Ms Hassan \"is very much focused on the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, and has been for last 25 years\".</p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, speaking to reporters at Downing Street, said the government would do \"whatever we can\" to secure Mrs Hassan's release. </p> <p>Speaking after previously scheduled talks with the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, Mr Blair said: \"This is someone who has lived in Iraq for 30 years, someone who is immensely respected, someone who is doing their level best to help the country. I think it shows you the type of people we are up against. </p> <p>\"We don't know which group it is, so there's really a limit at this stage to what I can say to you. We will do whatever we can, obviously.\" </p> <p>Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said he was \"very concerned\" by the kidnapping, adding: \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to her, her family and her colleagues.\" </p> <p>A foreign office spokesman said the embassy was trying urgently to establish what had happened, and was working closely with the Iraqi authorities. \"Consular officials are in touch with her next of kin,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Ideel Jafferi, a spokesmand for the Birmingham-based charity Islamic Relief, said staff were praying for Ms Hassan's safe release. \"We call for whoever is holding her hostage to think of her family and the good work she is doing in Iraq, and release her as soon as possible to let her carry on with the good work she is doing,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It's Ramadan - it's a time of peace and goodwill, and in this particularly holy month they must think of the family of Margaret and the people she is trying to help,\" he added. </p> <p>Care International is one of the world's largest independent global relief and development organisations. It operates in more than 72 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe, with its international secretariat based in Brussels, Belgium. </p> <p>It is one of the only international non-governmental organisations to maintain a continuous presence in Iraq. Most other NGOs withdrew their remaining foreign staff from the country after two Italian aid workers were kidnapped for three weeks in September.</p>",
  "<p>The health secretary, John Reid, today announced the appointment of a new chief nursing officer to lead the health service's running battle to rid hospital wards of the MRSA superbug.</p> <p>Chris Beasley, previously the interim head of the NHS Modernisation Agency, will prioritise improving hospital cleanliness and tackling hospital acquired infections such as MRSA, estimated to cause at least 5,000 deaths a year.</p> <p>To coincide with her appointment, Mr Reid also published a Matron's Charter, a \"no nonsense\" guide that outlines the role that all hospital staff should play in improving hospital hygiene. </p> <p>Ms Beasley, who has been nursing since 1962, said she relished the challenge of ensuring that all staff put hospital cleanliness at the top of the agenda.</p> <p>\"Matrons must lead by example and by making changes when things aren't up to scratch,\" she said. \"This charter gives a common sense approach to improving the environment in hospitals.\"</p> <p>A joint collaboration between the Department of Health and a group of health agencies including the Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Midwives and Infection Control Nurses Association, the charter sets out demands each matron will make of her ward staff. These include:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Before you buy new equipment, do you have a system in place to ensure it can be cleaned?<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Do you have a rapid reliable way of responding to patient comments?<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Does your trust involve infection control nurses in refurbishment and new build projects?</p> <p>The charter also sets out guidelines for new matrons such as ensuring all staff receive training in infection control and setting out the process by which matrons withhold payment for cleaning services that fail to come up to scratch.</p> <p>Plans for a Matron's Charter were first mooted in the Towards Cleaner Hospitals and Lower Rates of Infection report in July as part of an effort to gain control of the spread of hospital superbugs, which strike at least 100,000 people a year.</p> <p>On a visit to Middlesex hospital, Mr Reid said that fighting hospital-acquired infections would be the chief nursing officer's \"first concern\".</p> <p>\"Nurses, doctors and other staff are in the frontline of this struggle, and I am determined hospital managers and my department give them the support that they need,\" said Mr Reid.</p> <p>Ms Beasley's appointment comes a month after the previous chief nursing officer, Sarah Mullally, left the NHS to join the Church of England.</p> <p>The charter includes a 10-point priority plan for ensuring that hospitals are kept clean, including involving nurses and infection control teams in negotiating and drawing up cleaning contracts with external agencies. </p> <p>\"I have made it clear that cheapness is not a substitute for cleanliness,\" said Mr Reid.</p> <p>Matrons already have the right to withhold payment of contract cleaners if they feel the work is not up to standard.</p> <p>The health secretary said that there were no plans to ban contract cleaners \"at the moment\", but laid the blame for poor hygiene in hospitals on the previous government's policy of requiring health managers to contract out hospital cleaning to external agencies. </p> <p>He called Conservative criticism of his plans to fight MRSA as \"one of the most hypocritical positions I have ever heard the Conservatives take\". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said, \"The contracting-out system has left the control of cleaning out of the hands of the nurses, matrons and sisters and in some cases it has led to those doing the cleaning not feeling part of the team.\"</p> <p>The Matron's Charter attempts to tackle this problem by asking hospital staff to include cleaners in recreational activities and ensuring that cleaners' photographs are displayed alongside those of the staff on ward notice boards.</p>",
  "<b>British troops in Iraq</b> <br> The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, confirmed the US had asked for British troops to provide assistance outside the UK-controlled southern sector of Iraq. But he insisted that no decision had yet been made in response. A final recommendation from the chief of defence staff was expected by the middle of the week. <p>Mr Hoon told MPs the request did not ask for troops to be deployed to Baghdad City or Falluja. He denied it was political and had anything to do with the timing of the US presidential election. \"Although it is linked to elections - it is not the US elections but with efforts to create the best possible security situation in which to hold the Iraqi elections in January.\" </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, warned any such deployment would leave \"a big capability gap\" in the British sector and would represent \"a fundamental change\" in UK operations in Iraq. </p> <p>Robin Cook, who quit the cabinet over Iraq, said restraint shown by British troops in peacekeeping had earned them respect among the Iraqis. \"Is it really possible for them to retain that restraint if they are deployed to a US sector which has been policed for over a year by US forces which have not been showing the same level of restraint?\" </p> <p>Mr Hoon said British forces were able to adjust their approach and tactics in the light of the threat that they faced. \"They will have to be less restrained if there is a direct physical threat to them.\" </p> <p><b>Schooling shake-up</b><br> A blueprint for the biggest schooling shake-up in 60 years offers a \"cogently argued, challenging and compelling vision for the future\", the education secretary, Charles Clarke, said. He told MPs proposals by former chief inspector of schools Mike Tomlinson would provide the base on which to build a broad consensus for reform. </p> <p>Mr Clarke said the \"biggest single reform of qualifications in any of our lifetimes\" would present huge challenges and would take at least 10 years to introduce. </p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said any changes would have to be backed with \"substantial new resources\". Scrapping all existing exams would be an \"unwelcome and unnecessary diversion\" from the priority of improving \"unacceptably poor\" literacy and numeracy among school leavers. </p> <p><b>Gun culture</b><br> The home secretary David Blunkett called for concerted action to tackle \"unacceptable\" levels of gun crime as he led MPs in remembering 14-year-old shooting victim Danielle Beccan from Nottingham. He said new five-year minimum sentences for firearm possession were \"a starting point, not an end point\" in getting guns off the streets but warned pretending the situation was \"out of control\" would encourage a gun culture. </p> <p><b>Gun crime</b><br> One gun crime is committed every hour of every day in a Britain where a rising tide of firearms offences threatens to become \"an epidemic that afflicts the whole country\", the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said. He described the shooting in Nottingham as \"reminiscent of Chicago in the 1930s, not an historic English town\". </p> <p>The home secretary said that the government \"does not dispute at all\" the link between gun crime, hard drugs and criminal gangs. He said the supply and price of drugs in the UK was influenced by a wider global situation and that \"there has never been a tighter border control outside wartime than there is at the moment\". </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br> Tories dropped plans for a debate on climate change after government statements on Iraq and exam reforms left them short of time. Tory chiefs had planned to spend half the time debating the \"rising tide\" of gun crime and the rest urging action to curb carbon dioxide emissions. But business managers pulled the second debate after the statements. </p> <p><b>Grave desecration</b><br> Mr Blunkett condemned the desecration of a grave by suspected animal rights extremists and said he believed a proposed crackdown would be successful. </p> <p>He told MPs: \"The house would want all of us to join together in condemning the bestial extremists who 10 days ago desecrated a grave in Staffordshire and to send our sympathy to the family. We have the strongest licensing laws in this area in the world. We now need the strongest action to ensure that people can go about their lawful business and can do so free from intimidation.\" </p> <p><b>Sex offenders</b><br> Labour's Huw Edwards demanded a policy u-turn on housing sex offenders at Prescoed open prison after convicted paedophile Robert Stokes absconded this month for almost 24 hours. </p> <p>Home Office minister Paul Goggins said: \"The decision to place a limited number of sex offenders who are coming towards the end of their prison sentence in Prescoed Prison was not the result of overcrowding but was part of a planned programme where suitable risk assessment is taking place.\" He would be monitoring the programme carefully. </p> <p><b>Fireworks</b><br> Loopholes in legislation to tackle misuse of fireworks could be exploited by unscrupulous traders, Labour's John Cryer warned. He said they could allow traders to \"get through\" the net and urged ministers to reconsider a universal licensing system for all firework outlets. Home Office minister Hazel Blears insisted the Fireworks Act was \"robust\" and would make a significant difference. </p> <p><b>Fake colleges</b><br> More than 250 bogus colleges have been uncovered by a Home Office crackdown on illegal immigration, it emerged. Minister Des Browne said more than a quarter of 1,050 suspect institutions inspected so far had proved to be fake and a further 250 would be subjected to more rigorous investigation. </p> <p><b>Darfur crisis</b><br> The World Health Organisation has estimated that since March between 35,000 and 70,000 displaced people have died in Darfur, Sudan from violence, disease and malnutrition, Lords leader Lady Amos said. She also told peers the UN had estimated that 1.45 million had been displaced in the region and a further 200,000 had fled to Chad. </p> <p>Lady Amos gave the figures in response to crossbencher Lord Alton, a former Liberal Democrat MP, who spoke of \"the harrowing first-hand accounts of ethnically motivated killings, rapes, burnings and lootings\" in Darfur. </p> <p><b>Supreme court plans</b><br> The government was urged to postpone its planned constitutional shake-up until the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, makes a statement about the location and cost of the planned supreme court. </p> <p>Former Law Lord Lord Lloyd urged him to spell out plans for a new home for Law Lords who are to be removed from Westminster as part of the changes. </p> <p>Junior constitutional affairs minister Lady Ashton said during the constitutional reform bill's committee stage: \"The notion that anyone would want to see the Law Lords - who are held in the highest esteem - being bundled anywhere would be an anathema to all of us.\" There was \"no question\" of the court being housed in an inappropriate building. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, and his ministers and Cabinet Office minister Douglas Alexander face the Commons at question time. The companies (audit, investigations and community enterprise) bill is set to clear its remaining stages. Topics of backbench debates in Westminster Hall include the EU's relationship with Iran and protection of employees in private sector pension schemes. </p> <p>The Lords debates the housing bill's report stage and the civil contingencies bill's committee stage.</p>",
  "<p>Educators in New Zealand have generally welcomed the Tomlinson report, hailing the development as a vindication of their country's radical shake-up of secondary education but warning that the antipodean experience had not been without its salutary lessons.</p> <p>Among the cautionary criticisms most often voiced in New Zealand is that the country's similar new system has been - in the words of Roy Kelley, the headmaster of King's College, an independent school in Auckland - indecently rushed, poorly planned and badly resourced.</p> <p>\"I hear a number of alarm bells ringing,\" agreed Philip Smith, the president of the New Zealand Post Primary Teachers' Association, whose 16,000-strong organisation has said that \"ironing out the wrinkles\" in New Zealand's reform process will be one of its key objectives over the coming year.</p> <p>If anything, cautioned Mr Smith, the \"fragile consensus\" of teachers, unionists and policy makers which has kept the New Zealand experiment intact until now could prove even harder to maintain in the British situation.</p> <p>An education official from the country's Ministry of Education, who asked not to be identified because of his current work in guiding the local process, added: \"It would pay for the Brits not to underestimate the scale of change management that this kind of thing requires, especially when you have systems that have been in place as long as they have in Britain.\"</p> <p>In the run-up to this week's announcement, Mike Tomlinson repeatedly cited the example of New Zealand, where he visited and met with his local counterpart, and which has overhauled its own versions of GCSEs and A-levels with a standards-based diploma known as the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA).</p> <p>The New Zealand makeover is currently in its final year of a three-part implementation. Conceived in the early 1990s under an earlier conservative National Party government, the new qualification is something all pupils will now get: some at a basic or medium level, others an advanced level.</p> <p>As with the British reforms, the idea is that everyone who goes to school now comes out - preferably with 13 years of learning under their belts - with something to show for their effort, while also ensuring that vocational qualifications such as woodwork enjoy parity of esteem with academic ones. </p> <p>And pupils no longer fail, in the old-fashioned, \"elitist\" sense of the word; instead, the worst a student can do is \"not achieve\" in any given year.</p> <p>Subjects once examined in their entirety in New Zealand are now broken into bits to be taught and, largely, assessed internally by teachers awarding pupils credits. The old system of exam percentages has gone. </p> <p>Today, pupils get to enjoy a bigger role in setting their own academic pace, are no longer marked against each other and - in theory anyway - don't have to fret about how their schools fare in any league tables.</p> <p>In practice, said Mr Smith, the system has most often meant a substantial increase in the workloads typically being shouldered by most teachers, along with an onerous number of outside agencies - perhaps more than for any comparable profession - to which schools are now accountable.</p> <p>\"In our case, we were promised the earth in terms of support, but in fact got very little,\" he said. \"If it's at all the same in the UK, British teachers [had] better be prepared for some patchy support.\"</p> <p>Under the old system, final scores were manipulated so about half the students automatically failed regardless of the knowledge they showed. By definition, the new system cannot be manipulated in the same way, yet recent events have shown it can be tampered with to produce distinctly odd results.</p> <p>Probably the most controversial episode to date took place earlier this year at the country's Cambridge High School, a middle-of-the-road performer where internal markings in 2003 handily, and it transpired dubiously, outstripped those of virtually all of the schools previously regarded as New Zealand's leading lights.</p> <p>For two years the school boasted a 100% pass rate, and its 2002's combined qualification results, which included those from the new NCEA test, saw the state-funded institution placed second overall among the country's schools.</p> <p>At the same time, it was revealed that some of is teachers gave students answers to test questions, while at least one of its senior classes had been left without a teacher and had to be taught by a pupil. </p> <p>Abuzz with what it took to be the imperatives of the new regime, the school even closed its library, encouraging its students to spend more time surfing the internet instead.</p> <p>Critics were quick to blame the debacle on the new learning environment. Supporters, however, credited the system's \"transparency\" with helping bring the situation to light.</p> <p>Mr Smith, who praises the New Zealand experiment for having \"unlocked the straitjacket of the high school curriculum,\" does not count himself among the diehard doubters. Still, he said, the Cambridge situation showed the risk posed by \"those who would, and can, manipulate the system\".</p> <p>Almost as worrying for his association has been the surge of interest among traditionally minded parents for enrolling their offspring in privately administered tests like the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), now offered by 38 schools and recognised by all eight national universities.</p> <p>This year, 4,456 candidates from 38 schools will sit a CIE exam; three years ago, no New Zealand school offered the qualification.</p> <p>\"I'm not saying we should uninvent the wheel. But we still need to look at these issues. We still need to fine-tune,\" Mr Smith said.</p> <p>As will his British opposite numbers. \"We seem to be going down a parallel road, and that's nice,\" said Howard Fancy, the country's Secretary of Education. \"While our mechanisms may differ, this definitely shows we're thinking along similar lines. It's an interesting process.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Iraqi militants who kidnapped an Australian reporter in Baghdad and threatened to kill him \"Googled\" his name on the Internet to investigate his work before releasing him unharmed, the journalist's executive producer said Tuesday,\" reports Associated Press.</p> <p>\"John Martinkus, the first Australian confirmed as having been held hostage in Iraq, was seized early Saturday and held for nearly 24 hours before being freed. His executive producer at Australia's SBS network, Mike Carey, said the Internet... likely saved Martinkus.</p> <p>\"\"They checked on him to see if he was who he said he was,\" Carey told The Associated Press. \"They Googled him and then went onto a Web site \u2014 either his own or his book publisher's Web site, I don't know which one \u2014 and saw that he was who he was, and that was instrumental in letting him go, I think, or swinging their decision.\"</p> <p>The only hostile environment I'm planning on visiting soon is a pub in Hackney, but better make sure I've still got the top ranking on my own name... just in case.</p>",

  "Jack Straw today declared that Britain was \"very sympathetic\" to an American request for UK troops to deploy in Iraq as a fill-in for US forces - although an operational decision would only be taken after a reconnaissance mission by army experts today. <p>The foreign secretary insisted earlier that it was \"possible to say no\" to the request, although that would be \"letting down an ally\".</p> <p>In a joint press conference with Mr Straw in London this morning, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, did not specifically comment on the coalition deployment, but warned that a secure environment in Iraq was vital for effective reconstruction.</p> <p>He added that without this, \"smooth\" elections would not be possible in January, \"therefore to pacify the environment would be extremely helpful\".</p> <p>Mr Annan is to meet Tony Blair later today for private talks, as a furious spat opened up between the government and the only mainstream anti-war party, the Liberal Democrats, after Mr Straw accused them of wanting to leave Saddam in a \"strengthened\" position of power.</p> <p><b>'A strengthened Saddam'</b><br></p> <p>The foreign secretary launched a broadside against the Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, for opposing the war, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning: \"The choice was between our course or a strengthened Saddam Hussein, who for sure once the sanctions had degraded - as they were doing - and the troops had left, would have emerged more powerful, carrying out his torture and his tyranny within Iraq and threatening the region as a whole. </p> <p>\"That, I'm afraid, is the position of the Liberal Democrats which dare not speak its name in terms of their policy.\" </p> <p>An angry Mr Kennedy immediately rang in to Radio 4, demanding an apology from Mr Straw for \"scandalously\" misrepresenting his party's Iraq policy. The Lib Dem leader accused Mr Straw of insulting millions of voters who also opposed the war.</p> <p>He accused the government of \"moving the goalposts\" on the case for the war and said: \"I want an apology today from the foreign secretary for what he has said about us and what he has said about the millions of people in this country who have agreed with us.</p> <p>\"To try to suggest or imply, as he did, that somehow those of us who were against the war were, in fact, covertly in favour of some form of strengthened Saddam Hussein is an absolute insult to the integrity as well as the intelligence of people. </p> <p>Mr Straw had said: \"We have a responsibility for sorting the situation [in Iraq] out. Those who opposed the military action, however, also have their responsibility.</p> <p>\"As of March 2003, the possibility of securing a weakened Saddam by effective inspections and an ultimatum wasn't on offer.\"</p> <p><b>'Compelling justification'</b><br></p> <p>The Conservative leader, Michael Howard, this morning accused the government of having failed to provide a \"compelling\" reason why UK troops should now fill in for the US in Iraq.</p> <p>Mr Howard told Today: \"We don't have a reserve force in southern Iraq for fun. It is there for a purpose.\"</p> <p>Although the south of Iraq is relatively quiet, British troops in towns such as Amara have come under heavy attack in recent weeks, he said.</p> <p>\"If there is a compelling justification for us to accept that greater risk, then we will support that deployment, but we haven't had it yet.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw countered that it was a \"myth\" to suggest that the British-administered area in the south was entirely safe, while US troops in the so-called \"triangle of death\" were under constant attack.</p> <p>\"That is simply untrue. It is an insult to our soldiers and to American solders,\" he told Today. Mr Straw also insisted that Britain could refuse the request: \"It is possible to say no. It depends on the advice we receive from the professional soldiers on the ground. </p> <p>\"I think we would be letting down an ally if we were to say no in the face of very clear advice from our own British commanders that we should make this contribution.\"</p> <p><b>January elections</b><br></p> <p>The purpose of any change in UK troops' positions would be to ensure that elections to an independent Iraqi government went ahead throughout the country in January as planned.</p> <p>\"It is of critical importance that the insurgency is dealt with, otherwise - particularly given the electoral system, which is one constituency for the country - the elections would be flawed,\" said Mr Straw. </p> <p>\"That is why it is necessary for us to make an additional effort.\" </p> <p>He rejected warnings against \"mission creep\", insisting that coming to the assistance of the US in this way could ensure that Britain's responsibilities in Iraq are brought to a swifter conclusion.</p> <p>\"The point of doing this, far from there being any aim of getting bogged down, is so that we can stick to the timetable set by the UN security council and therefore hand over effective power and control - as well as the sovereignty already handed over - to the Iraqi people quicker than would otherwise be the case,\" he said.</p> <p>Reports that the chief of defence staff had expressed opposition to the move to ministers were \"simply untrue\", said Mr Straw.</p> <p>\"We are all in the same position, that if this is operationally justified we should go ahead,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Part of the purpose of the reconnaissance mission by military experts is to ensure that if British troops are put into an area north of their current area of operation, they can make a contribution, but also that the risk to those troops, and therefore the anxiety to their families, is not too high.\"</p> <p>Debate over the deployment comes as Mr Blair holds talks today with Mr Annan. It is the first time they have met since Mr Annan's recent warning that the war in Iraq was illegal.</p> <p>Speaking after his talks with Mr Annan, Mr Straw said: \"They have got the elections well organised ... and in terms of the administrative arrangements these are on course. But of course the key issue there is that of security, ensuring a security environment in which the elections can take place satisfactorily. </p> <p>\"The people of Iraq have waited a long time for the chance to elect their leaders and we are determined they should be able to do so.\"</p>",
  "<p>The first thing you notice, when you climb inside the new Peugeot 407 SW and close the door, is that you appear still to be outside. True, things are substantially quieter than they were when you were standing on the pavement, and the elements don't appear to be interfering with you to the extent that they were a moment earlier. But in every other respect, it's as if the door never went \"chunk\". Or, to be more accurate, \"chank\". (Or \"chanque\", to use the French term. \"Chunk\" is only really available on cars costing more than \u00a330,000 and built in Germany.) </p> <p>The explanation for the illusion, as sharper drivers will quickly work out, is the roof. In the process of doing up the trusty 407 saloon to form a five-door estate version, Peugeot appears to have had one of those architects in who says: \"I know, let's make the entire house out of glass.\" And then they've reined him in, as you have to with architects, but not before he's had his way with the top floor. </p> <p>We're not talking about your average car sunroof here, which is niggardly and light-phobic by comparison. We're talking about a major tribute to the art of glazing. The roof is one enormous sheet of glass, flooding the cabin with daylight (subject to availability) and offering, at a mere tilt of the chin, panoramic views of the sky, the tops of trees and the upper decks of buses. </p> <p>Bear in mind that the windscreen on this car is so big it could have come off a National Express coach, and that the window on the tailgate wraps around until it all but meets the side windows coming the other way. You can see, then, that Peugeot is telling no word of a lie when it claims that the glass in a 407 SW would, if laid out flat, cover almost five square metres of space. </p> <p>In some ways, this excellent, rakish structure is wasted as a mere car. Several other applications suggest themselves immediately. It's the perfect environment for growing tomatoes, for one thing, although you would probably need to rip the seats out in order to take full advantage of the car's possibilities as a greenhouse. If you could rely on it for water-tightness, it would be a handy craft from which to observe fish in their natural habitat. </p> <p>Alternatively, recent reports suggest that increasing numbers of British hobbyists are choosing to visit car parks at semi-remote beauty spots in order to watch each other have sex in cars. In these circles, particularly, it's easy to see how the 407 SW could become the attractively-priced car of choice. It's a dogger's delight. </p> <p>People who set a higher store by their privacy should note that the car comes with an electronically operated roof-blind, which unscrolls without fuss in four, interleaving sections to form a conventional-looking underside, for those moments, familiar to everyone in the public eye, when the exposure seems too intense. </p> <p>But then the 407 SW is an adaptable car altogether. It's roomy and low-silled, like an estate, and its seats split and fold flat in various combinations, suitable for the carrying of single mattresses to dumps. And it plays to all the traditional paranoias that beset the family-car owner, arriving with no fewer than nine airbags to share between its five seats. That's almost two each, and I was sorely tempted to slam the car into the side of my house just to see them all go up. </p> <p>The instrument panel also features an almost comically neurotic, permanent surveillance system, attuned to everything in the car that moves, and demonstrating, by means of pictograms and verbal warnings, that, for instance, you have just changed the speed of the windscreen wipers. If someone were to break wind in the back seats, you'd be surprised not to read about it in the multifunction display. </p> <p>Nevertheless, with its rangy, angular bodywork, and the streaked teardrop-shape of its headlamps, the 407 SW does a fairly good impression of a car that isn't an estate at all. It appears to be hunkering down and hoping that nobody notices it isn't a hatchback. And with a range-topping 2.0 litre diesel engine inside it, and a six-speed gearbox, it can be made to pull and turn like a hatchback, too. </p> <p>The interior is deeply carpeted and cushioned, and splendidly replete with dedicated moulded plastic areas for your glasses, pens and crushed Ribena cartons, but it's a bit fiddly in places. On the panel operating the hi-fi and the special, soft-flow air-conditioning, I counted 42 buttons. Surely at least two of those could have been rationalised away. </p> <p>Also, the name has got to be a bit of a problem, hasn't it? By the time Peugeot had finished adding bits to my model, it was obliged to be known as a 407 SW SE HDi 136, which is more like a VAT registration number than a decent title for a car. Still, the item itself is, conversely, a neat little package: lots of room and a view.</p>",
  "<p>Objectively, this is a very bad tourist experience. At least at the Eiffel Tower, the other highlight of travel-brochure Paris, you get the excitement of the lift and an incredible view. Here you get one small, dark picture surrounded by a jostling crowd of hundreds. </p> <p>It is hard to see how anyone can genuinely enjoy looking at the painting in these circumstances, which probably explains why most people don't. A few seconds, a few photographs and the line moves on. The speed with which the majority of visitors deal with this tourist obligation is astonishing. And yet, unless they have anarchist tendencies, no first-time visitor to Paris would consider skipping it. </p> <p>The Mona Lisa remains the most famous painting in the world. This year the crowds lining up to see it have grown thicker than ever, with the influx of millions of new Chinese tourists into Europe. A day spent in the room where the picture hangs reveals much about the global tourist industry - illustrating which countries are doing well enough economically to allow their middle classes the chance to visit France. It casts only scant light on why people still bother to come in their thousands to pay homage to the painting. </p> <p>If you starting queuing well before the Louvre's doors open at 9am, and walk briskly through a network of long galleries that stand between the entrance hall and the first-floor room where the painting hangs, you can reach the Mona Lisa at about 9.09, before anyone else. For a short few minutes it is cool and quiet. A guard is rearranging the crowd barriers in the centre of the room with careful precision. </p> <p>Four Chinese tourists are the first visitors at 9.11. They arrive, visibly delighted, and begin to examine the picture, holding their hands up to shield their eyes against a sun which isn't there. They take a few pictures of the painting and then of each other in front of the painting. Their delight lasts for about 50 seconds, after which they hurry off. </p> <p>The rumble of dozens of approaching feet is already audible by 9.14, as dozens of people make their way rapidly down the grand gallery, rushing past Caravaggios, Bellinis, Raphaels and a few other da Vincis, guided by the Mona Lisa signposts. By 9.20 there is a group of 28 people standing in front of the painting and fathers are already having to hold their children above the crowd so that they can see. </p> <p>\"People come because she is famous. Period,\" says Pete Brown, a retired businessman from Iowa, with some irritation. \"But you want my opinion honestly? I'm not overly impressed.\" </p> <p>At 9.30 the crowd has grown to about 47. Mobile phones are used to take pictures. Children show their parents how to use the equipment. The noise of the clicking of shutters, the buzzing of zooms whirring in and out, the satisfied pips of the machinery signalling its readiness, becomes overwhelming. Some couples kiss as they walk away, happy that another part of the Paris experience has been completed. At 10.14 the mass of people is 12 rows deep; 15 minutes later there are so many people elbowing from behind that it becomes uncomfortable to stand at the curved wooden barrier by the front of the picture. </p> <p>\"She must be one of the ugliest women in the world,\" a teenager mutters. </p> <p>Waiting to see the Mona Lisa has all the thrill of standing in an airport check-in queue. The crowd pushes forward, cattle-like and unquestioning, performing a ritual they know they have to go through with in order to complete a pre-ordained tourist experience. </p> <p>By midday the room is seething with visitors, the line heaves towards the front, a slow, weary museum trudge, and around 70 more people file in every minute. Caged in a box of bullet-proof glass, the picture looks unimpressive under the harsh institutional lighting. Winking dots of red and orange reflected camera eyes dance across the canvas and every few seconds the Mona Lisa's face is obscured by another flash. </p> <p>\"I don't know why they keep coming,\" Stephane, a security guard who has worked for the Louvre for the past two years, says. \"It's a nice painting, but there are many more interesting pictures elsewhere in the museum. People don't look at it anyway. They come in, take a picture and leave. It takes 15 seconds.\" </p> <p>\"People no longer study it. It is no longer a painting, but has become a symbol of a painting,\" says Darian Leader, author of Stealing the Mona Lisa: What Art Stops Us From Seeing. Looking at the visitors from the front of the crowd, about half have their faces pressed into a camera. Those at the back arch onto tiptoes, hold their arms far above their head and take a picture, paparazzi-style. </p> <p>You have to feel sorry for Salvator Rosa, whose pictures hang to the left and the right of the Mona Lisa. No one spares a glance for the enormous Heroic Battle, 1652, to the left, with its dramatic portrayal of carnage. There must have been a time when this would have been the more obvious crowd-gatherer, but a sequence of quite random events has transformed the Mona Lisa over the past century into a celebrity painting. </p> <p>Before the 1789 revolution, scarcely anyone had access to it. Then, with the creation of the Louvre, it was for some time kept in the curator's bureau, away from the hordes, and valued much less than Leonardo's Virgin and Child with St Anne. But as the romantic poets of the 19th century began to be obsessed with the femme fatale, the Mona Lisa was seized on as an ideal of womanhood, her smile and the eyes venerated. The confusion over quite who she was increased her allure. </p> <p>Donald Sassoon, author of Becoming Mona Lisa - The History of the World's Most Famous Painting, points out that such was the profusion of religious paintings of saints, famous royals, skinny Dutch women and obese Rubens females, that there weren't that many other paintings of unknown, beautiful women to choose as the object of male fantasies. </p> <p>Then just as the painting was gaining mass recognition, it was stolen in 1911, at a time when popular newspapers were booming. The image was reproduced globally as the search began. Such was the painting's new significance, that people lined up to stare at the empty space where the picture had been hanging. The story of the theft and its rediscovery inspired dozens of books and films. Then came the lampooning of the work by Marcel Duchamp, the appropriation of the image by surrealists, pop artists, and finally by the advertising industry. </p> <p>Art historian EH Gombrich says the picture has become so worn out by all these references that it's almost impossible \"to see it with fresh eyes\". But the reality is that in the Louvre, you cannot really see the painting at all for the far more practical reason that there are too many other people in front of it. </p> <p>Some visitors are quite open about their frustration. \"The Mona Lisa is probably the single most disappointing piece of work in the entire world,\" Guy Kress, an experimental psychologist from California, says. \"The picture everyone has in their minds is much larger and brighter.\" It is true that the poster reproduction in the museum shop is a much bolder image. With this fresh in your mind, the original looks dour and gloomy. </p> <p>Moonkyou Kim, a tour guide with a group of 16 tourists from Seoul, taking a 10-day whirlwind tour of Europe with 24 hours in France, says the anti-climax is palpable. \"People aren't very happy when they see it. It's too small. They don't believe it's the original.\" But of the 51 people approached randomly over the day, the majority still say the picture is wonderful and they are thrilled to have seen it. Despite the crush and the inconvenience there is for many a reluctance to question the value of the experience. </p> <p>To doubt that the Mona Lisa is worth seeing is a bit like asking whether it's worth coming to Paris at all. The Mona Lisa is a key part of the Paris package, and one of the reasons why you come to France, why you come to Europe. For most tourists this moment will be a critical part of their memory of France as a whole. To come here and not be amazed or delighted is in some way to admit that the whole Paris experience is somehow not as great as it's cracked up to be. Most people know this is illogical, and yet they buy into it anyway. \"When you come to Paris for the first time, you have to see the cliches. You can't be too proud,\" Oded Hauptaman, an opthamologist from Melbourne says. </p> <p>Among the thousands who process past throughout the day, there are very few who pause to look hard. Takuya Sejima is an exception, stopping for over 30 minutes, holding his hand up towards his eyes at different angles, using his museum plan to help measure different sections of the painting, making notes. Next to the rushing masses, his behaviour looks eccentric, verging on the insane. An 18-year-old art student from Tokyo, he wants to assess why daVinci made the left hand so much larger than the right hand, and so out of proportion with the face. \"It's marvellous. It's difficult to express why in words,\" he says. </p> <p>Later the tourists become wearier, their legs heavier, more prone to squabbling with their partners. The number of tour groups dwindles. The number of French visitors increases. Leading away his small group of French art enthusiasts, Bruno de Baecque explains: \"People invest a lot of hope into the prospect of seeing the Mona Lisa for the first time. It becomes a quasi-sacred experience. They're ready to suffer considerable discomfort to extract some pleasure from the experience. No one can really know if they're disappointed. I tell people to try to enjoy the thrill of seeing the painting surrounded by crowds.\" </p> <p>By 9.30pm there are only about 10 people left in the room, and for the first time all day there's time to really examine the painting. But as closing time approaches, guards shoo the remaining visitors away so that only Mohamed Elabdi, the night cleaner, remains sweeping away the mound of rubbish discarded over the day at the foot of the painting. </p> <p>After 30 years in France, he saw the painting for the first time three days ago when he started this new job with the Louvre. \"It's hard to hard to understand what the fuss is about,\" he says. \"But the way that the eyes follow you around the room as you work is disconcerting.\"</p>",
  "No one could have accused the Conservative government of breaking its promise to bring back Victorian values. When, in 1992, it permitted private water companies to install pre-paid meters in Birmingham, the people who couldn't afford to flush their toilets started defecating into pots, which they then emptied out of the windows of their tower blocks. It made one quite nostalgic. <p>The meters were ruled illegal in 1998, on the grounds that they deprived the poor of their most important resource. So it goes without saying that the model has now been exported to two of the world's poorest urban communities. </p> <p>Some African countries are so short of money that delivering clean water to everyone is almost impossible. But not South Africa. In purchasing power terms, it is the world's 21st biggest economy. It is also one of the most unequal. It could afford to provide everyone with sufficient water, as long as it was prepared to sting the rich and subsidise the poor. But that is a \"non-market policy\", and therefore out of bounds. </p> <p>The problem for any government which attempts to run its services on free-market principles is that some people cannot afford to pay. This means that you must send men to their homes to cut them off. In South Africa, where people are aware of their rights, that means confrontations and riots. So Johannesburg city council, which has set up a public-private partnership with the British firm Northumbrian Water and its French parent Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, has devised an easier way to do it: rather than disconnect people, you force them to disconnect themselves. Over the past year, the council has been installing pre-paid water meters in the two poorest districts of Johannesburg: Orange Farm and Phiri. It has chosen them for the obvious reason that they contain the largest proportion of people who can't pay. </p> <p>It does so in full knowledge of the consequences. Pre-paid meters were first installed in Madlebe, in KwaZulu Natal, in 2000. Those who had no money had to draw their water from the rivers. The inevitable outbreak of cholera infected over 100,000 people, and killed 260. The meter scheme was dropped. </p> <p>Today, a full-scale insurrection is brewing in Phiri. Last week the residents blockaded the main road through Soweto. They have been ripping up the pipes and fighting with the workmen. The old anti-apartheid activists have now turned on the ANC. </p> <p>To understand what is happening in South Africa, you must first understand the role of its biggest foreign investor, the United Kingdom. So let me take you back to the days of Victorian values, and the visit to South Africa in 1996 of the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke. Trade missions are normally led by junior trade ministers. But South Africa had a new government, which wanted to invest heavily, but whose leaders had no experience of running a country. It was rich, naive and ready to be led by the nose. </p> <p>\"Privatisation has been at the very heart of our public-sector reforms in Britain,\" Clarke explained before he went. \"Can what we have done here in the UK be exported to South Africa? I would argue definitely yes ... British business can help. They have an unrivalled wealth of experience in privatisation, private finance and all types of public sector reform ... The real beneficiaries of reform will not be the politicians or company shareholders but the ordinary people. ... In this way, Britain can share in the bright future that beckons for South Africa.\" </p> <p>South Africa is too big simply to be told what to do. Foreign governments can't just march in there with instructions as they do in Zambia or Mozambique. But since apartheid fell, the World Bank, the IMF, the UK and the US have been flooding the country with advisers and consultants. In 1996 the policy paid off when the government devised something called the Growth, Employment and Redistribution Strategy. It's widely seen as a self-imposed structural adjustment programme: it does everything the powerful countries wanted, while creating the impression that it was all South Africa's idea. And at the heart of it is the notion that \"market disciplines\" will help the poor to escape from poverty. </p> <p>The corporations loved it. KPMG told its clients that if they went to South Africa, they would \"find a major business opportunity about to burst forth in a country where there is a lot of goodwill towards UK\". The International Project Finance Association reported that UK businesses \"now have the opportunity to export their public-private partnership know-how and expertise ... We are world leaders within this field and must now capitalise on the various opportunities that exist abroad.\" </p> <p>The Labour government took South African civil servants on a tour of privately financed British hospitals, and took the private financiers on a tour of South Africa. The South African government, unaware that Britain's private finance initiative rests upon nine separate kinds of public fraud and false accounting, began commissioning its new hospitals and prisons by the same means and from the same British companies. Now, suckered again by a new round of trade fairs and ministerial visits, it has begun to permit foreign companies to move in on its essential public services. Making a bed for them requires \"cost recovery\" and \"marketisation\", which is why pre-paid meters are now being imposed upon the people of Phiri and Orange Farm. </p> <p>The agency keeping the South African government on track is Britain's Department for International Development (DfID). This year it is giving \u00a36.3m to the Adam Smith Institute - the ultra-rightwing privatisation lobby group - for \"public-sector reform\" in South Africa. Staggeringly, the institute has been given its own budget - \u00a35m of British aid money - to disburse as it pleases. By this means, DfID can generate all the support it likes for privatisation and public-private partnerships, while avoiding direct responsibility for the decisions the institute makes. </p> <p>DfID is plainly breaking the law. The International Development Act forbids it from spending money for any purpose other than the elimination of poverty. It might also have broken the rules forbidding it to link aid money to deals for specific British businesses. DfID funds or has recently funded (it has so far been unable to tell me whether or not the scheme is still current) something called the \"British investment in South Africa promotion scheme\", which promotes \"business-to-business links\" between companies in the UK and companies in South Africa. What this is doing inside a foreign aid department, no one can say. </p> <p>I am not suggesting that DfID has told Johannesburg council \"thou shalt strike a public-private partnership with a British company, and make sure that it is profitable for that company by forcing everyone to pay the full price for their water, regardless of their ability to do so\". I am suggesting that it is creating a policy environment which encourages that outcome. And it is doing so with money allocated for something called foreign aid. Is there anyone out there who thinks this is how it should be spent? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Key council services will grind to a halt unless the recruitment and retention crisis is tackled urgently, local authorities were warned today.</p> <p>Figures released today by the Employers' Organisation for local government reveal councils are heading for a drought, with 94% of employers reporting recruitment and retention difficulties across the board. </p> <p>The biggest recruitment struggle for councils is in social work, with children and family posts the hardest to fill (88%), followed by care in the community (75%), residential (61%) and approved social work (51%).</p> <p>Half the authorities have problems recruiting teachers and educational psychologists, and face an uphill task in recruiting planning officers and environment health. </p> <p>Almost half of the 172 authorities surveyed also admitted difficulties filling manual jobs (46%), while just under one in five had problems finding clerical and administrative staff.</p> <p>The demographic timebomb facing councils means that councils must set their sights on recruiting young blood into their organisations, the Employers' Organisation said.</p> <p>Only 8% of local government staff are aged under 25, while a quarter of the workforce will retire within the next decade.</p> <p>A Unison survey of more than 3,000 staff published earlier this year revealed almost a third of council staff were seriously considering quitting their jobs because of low morale and high levels of stress, compounded by poor pay and conditions, </p> <p>Many complained that career paths and training opportunities were in short supply, which tallies with the EO's own findings which found 30% of councils had skills gaps. </p> <p>Martin Stein, EO senior consultant, said councils must act to ensure future service delivery. \"A failure to recruit young people could lead to a breakdown in services as local government struggles to attract the recruits it needs,\" said Mr Stein.</p> <p>\"Many young people do not realise the range of work available in local government and therefore do not think of it when choosing a career. </p> <p>\"When raising awareness of the variety of local government career opportunities, we've got to get 'beyond the bins'!\" he said.</p> <p>To help boost recruitment, the EO is working with local councils on a major campaign to promote themselves as employers at a local government careers day being held tomorrow. </p> <p>Dave Prentis, Unison's general secretary, said part of the problem was that local government suffers from a \"serious image problem with young people\" which should be urgently addressed to stop the crisis worsening. Young people with student debts to pay off need to be persuaded councils offer viable options, he said. </p> <p>\"Local authorities need to offer interesting, challenging and rewarding work with good career prospects, if they hope to compete with the private sector,\" he said. </p> <p>\"A career in local government used to be seen as secure with a decent pension at the end of it. Today, proposed changes to the pension scheme threatens to undermine that security and without new blood coming into the scheme the pensions crisis will only deepen.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Unison today reiterated calls for a new minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour, to free low paid workers from in-work benefits and taxpayers from the burden of subsidising poverty wage employers. </p> <p>Unison's latest submission to the Low Pay Commission argues that \u00a36.50 an hour is the minimum needed for the government to achieve its aim of eradicating poverty and making work pay. The union is today drawing up a coordinated pay strategy at a meeting of Unison negotiators.</p>",

  "<p>Mothers and their babies are being made ill by common household products such as air fresheners, polish, deodorants and hair sprays, researchers claimed last night. </p> <p>They said frequent use of such chemicals appeared to increase the risk of diarrhoea, earache and other symptoms in infants as well as headaches and depression in mothers. </p> <p>The findings came from a survey of more than 10,000 women on the use of fresheners and other aerosols during pregnancy and early childhood, as well as their health and that of their offspring. </p> <p>The study is among the first to look at the effects of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), on infants. Researchers in Australia recently suggested high levels of VOCs may contribute to asthma in toddlers. </p> <p>Alex Farrow, its lead author, said more than 40% of families used air fresheners regularly. \"People may think that using these products makes their homes cleaner and healthier, but being cleaner might not necessarily mean being healthier. </p> <p>\"Air fresheners combined with other aerosol and household products contribute to a complex mixture of chemicals and a build-up of VOCs in the home environment. Pregnant women and babies up to six months may be particularly susceptible, because they spend around 80% of their time at home. There may also be implications for other groups who are at home a good deal, such as old people.\" </p> <p>Dr Farrow, of Brunel University's school of health sciences and social care, said: \"More research is needed but in the meantime it might be safer to limit use of air fresheners and aerosols in the home. Squeezing a lemon is just as effective at freshening the air.\" </p> <p>The study relied on reported symptoms and the team admitted other unknown factors might contribute to symptoms in infants, such as diarrhoea and vomiting. Levels of VOCs in the homes were below established safety levels, but these were often set for adults and those at work. </p> <p>Women may be more prone to the effects of solvents due to their greater percentage of body fat, and the \"complex mixture of unknown chemicals\" in the home may have an extra effect on their and their babies' health. </p> <p>The study formed part of Bristol University's Children of the 90s project, which has followed the development of 14,000 children since before their birth. It said 32% more babies suffered diarrhoea in homes where air fresheners were used daily than in those where they were used once a week or less. They also suffered more from earache. Daily use of aerosols in other products were associated with a 30% rise in diarrhoea, and, to a lesser extent, vomiting. </p> <p>Mothers suffered nearly 10% more headaches where air fresheners and aerosols were used daily. There was also a link between fresheners and levels of maternal depression; 16% of mothers reporting depression compared with 12.7% of those who seldom used them, an extra risk of 26%. </p> <p>The questions on aerosol and air freshener use were included after levels of VOCs were studied in 170 randomly selected homes. </p> <p>Given the Australian study on VOCs and asthma in infants, the British research found no significant link between the use of aerosols and symptoms in mothers such as wheezing, cough or cold, eczema, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. </p> <p>Further work was needed, said the team, to identify VOC levels in blood among people with regular long-term, low-level exposure to household products containing them.</p>",
  "<p>Leave early, says expert</p> <p>As a 15-year-old at secondary school, I was interested to read last week's article about young people's ideas on the new curriculum (Being there, doing that, Cover story, October 12). They are without a doubt the real experts in the area and make a number of important suggestions. Most significant, in my opinion, are their proposals for better organisation of work experience placements, recognition of responsibilities unsupported by qualifications, and more emphasis on life skills, such as stress management and social interaction. There is one issue, however, that I am surprised to see is not mentioned: student behaviour.</p> <p>The effects of the disrespect shown by some school pupils, particularly teenagers, are appalling. First, any single act of disobedience causes a distraction, so everything takes twice as long to be taught or get done. Further time is wasted as those in charge have to talk about the offences and punish the wrongdoers. The students who actually care about their work must neglect it because of their peers who do not. The process inevitably discourages the teachers from making an effort, so in the end everybody loses. I can't see that even the note-passers and back-talkers can get much long-term satisfaction.</p> <p>The solution I offer is to bring forward the end of compulsory education to year 10 or even year 9. The most obvious result would be that those who seriously do not want to be at school can leave, and will have no more negative influence on their friends. The students who do decide to remain will know they are there by choice, so there is no point in intentional disruption. An improvement in classroom behaviour would be a huge benefit to young people and teachers alike.<br> <strong>Name supplied</strong><br> <strong>Bromley, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>No sympathy</strong></p> <p>Your diary correspondent (Deep end, Teach, October 12) seemed surprised to find another group in the workforce who work in challenging conditions (\"Teachers are not alone in the hard-work/high-stress/ low-pay ratio\"). I am baffled by the notion, increasingly played upon by some teachers and those who speak for them, that their situation is unique.</p> <p>The \"I am worse off than anyone else\" approach risks losing the sympathy of parents for the hard job teachers do indeed have in educating and caring for our children. However, the rest of the working world has to function without the luxury of half-terms, long Christmas breaks and summer holidays.</p> <p>The bottom line is that a large proportion of the working population has to put in extremely long hours without the number of breaks teachers have to recharge their batteries. Now, people are being told they will have to work until they are over 70 in order to achieve a half-way decent standard of living in retirement.</p> <p>Teachers should aim to get our respect for the quality of the work they do, not ask for our sympathy because they feel hard done by.<br> <strong>Pamela Dix</strong><br> <strong>Woking</strong></p> <p><strong>Figure it out, minister</strong></p> <p>If Kim Howells, the new minister for further education, wants to get to know his patch better (Keen eye on a new landscape, Further, October 12), he could ask at his local college about a maths course. He has missed a glaring reason why the parents of school children have more electoral muscle than parents of college students: there are a lot more of them.</p> <p>Children are in schools for at least 11 years. Since each age group numbers about 600,000, and, assuming that children, on average, have two parents or step-parents who are concerned about their education, that adds up to more than 14 million parents of school children - a huge proportion of the electorate.</p> <p>Although slightly more 16- and 17-year-olds are in FE or sixth-form colleges than in schools, only just over 1 million people are parents of teenagers in colleges. In fact, since the majority of FE students are over 25, voters are more likely to be FE students in their own right than parents of FE students.</p> <p>There is, of course, another reason why college students' parents find it difficult to make their voices heard amid the clamour for a return to 11-18 schools. That is because they are much more likely to be from a disadvantaged background than are parents of students in school sixth forms.</p> <p>If ministers don't even understand the context they're operating in, then is the strategic area review just an attempt to pass the buck down to the local learning and skills councils and local authorities?<br> <strong>Judith Watson</strong><br> <strong>Senior research fellow, School of the environment, University of Brighton</strong></p> <p>I note with interest that Kim Howells' plans for FE and HE seem to involve nothing short-term and a commendable attachment to avoid meaningless reviews and inquiries. So is it Howells the Stalinist, rather than Howells the marketeer, who is on display in his new job, I wonder? <br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br> <strong>London</strong></p> <p><strong>For grammar's sake</strong></p> <p>What hopes for the teaching of English when the vice-chancellor of an English university says: \"I'll do it for free\" (Opinion, October 12)?<br> <strong>JW Howes</strong><br> Loughton</p>",
  "<p>Many of you will have read All in a Day, devised almost 20 years ago by Mitsumasa Anno. The principal theme is peace, a message to be shared by the members of the global village in which we live, learn and, for some, teach.</p> <p>As the authors of the book describe, children's activities are related to the very different conditions in which they live, created in part by time and climate. The book focuses on new year's day in eight time zones, highlighting the differences in the way we look while emphasising that we are all fundamentally the same.</p> <p>The main actors in the text are children of a similar age; waking, sleeping, playing, eating, interacting with the environment in which they live. The children who attend schools and colleges across the UK are also representative of a number of cultures, heritages and background, yet all have the same desire and need for food, warmth, communication and peace.</p> <p>While teachers are responsible for the transmission of knowledge, this is never in isolation from the experiences learners bring to the classroom. Increasingly, schools are the only places where some children can find the peace they need to grow.</p> <p>As Anno and his collaborators demonstrate, there are strong similarities and differences between children around the globe. But teachers have similar, yet different, characteristics. The similarities could include a desire to be part of a community of learners who through their practice and lives are committed to value-based education.</p> <p>This is described in the European Commission report, Learning for the 21st century, in which the authors explain that learning is a composite of learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be. Applying this to practice would extend the role of the teacher, for in addition to the transmission of knowledge that prepares the learner for a job, there is also a responsibility for preparing them to become citizens.</p> <p>Social commentators inform us that there is a social and economic need for people to be lifelong learners. Nowadays, irrespective of location, people rarely find a job for life; there is a need for lifelong learning. In theory, there has never been a better time to be a teacher.</p> <p>Within the cycle of learning, teachers are also lifelong learners, with a need to develop further their skills. Teachers need support in maintaining and improving the achievements of the learner; fundamentally, they require a basic set of tools that encompasses working with knowledge regardless of subject or discipline.</p> <p>The tools will also include the training and education required to develop an ability to collaborate and work with an increasingly diverse range of professionals and learners. Returning to the simple yet powerful message of Anno's book, teachers also require the tools to develop the voice of the learner, be that adult or child.</p> <p>Anno concludes the introduction by commenting that each country has a neighbourhood in which children live, beyond which there is another country that shares the same sun and moon. In this text, no child is isolated from the others. The same could be said of learners and teachers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Sonia Blandford is dean of education at Canterbury Christ Church University College. <a href=\"mailto:masterclass@cant.ac.uk\">masterclass@cant.ac.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>These are exciting times to be doing physics research - but a good deal too exciting for the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (Pparc), the body that has to fund it.</p> <p>Quite apart from the Large Hadron Collider being built deep beneath the Franco-Swiss border, at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern) near Geneva, there is a wave of big projects taking the physics community by storm - a series of European missions to Mars, a gigantic optical telescope to observe earth-like planets orbiting faraway stars, a square kilometre array of radio telescopes to probe deep space and a 30km particle smasher.</p> <p>Researchers in this country are hoping to get a piece of the action when preparatory research and development programmes for these projects get under way in the next decade.</p> <p>But with financial uncertainties stalling the UK's main funder of particle physics and astronomy, it remains unclear whether the UK can afford its researchers to take part in all of them.</p> <p>Normally, the UK research councils would find out their three-year budgets in December, following a spending review such as the one this summer. But this year, a new performance management system will delay the budget announcements for the 2005-08 period until Easter next year.</p> <p>The timing could not be worse for Pparc, which needs to know its future budget sooner rather than later, to make urgent, long-term planning decisions. Already, it has had to make a funding commitment for the preparatory phase of Aurora, the European Space Agency's (ESA) project for exploration of Mars, without knowing whether it will be able to fund the programme proper.</p> <p>The \u00a35m commitment will make the UK a \"leading contributor\" to Aurora, Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, said at the announcement on October 1. Of that sum, \u00a33.5m will be signed away to ESA as a blank cheque towards the preparatory phase. The remaining \u00a31.5m will be spent on research and development activities in the UK.</p> <p>The decision to put money into Aurora at this preparatory stage indicates a positive feeling in Pparc about the ability to find in its future budget the \u00a325m a year that full Aurora membership will require. \"It is implicit if you do R&amp;D in an area that you will put the necessary money on the table [to build it],\" said Professor Ian Halliday, Pparc's chief executive.</p> <p>But the future of the UK in Aurora still depends on a favourable budget settlement this spring. \"It's a good start for the R&amp;D preparation,\" said Professor Martin Ward, chair of Pparc's science committee. \"But it is far short of what will be needed in the long term.\"</p> <p>Aurora is the first of the next generation of big physics projects to reach the stage where firm funding commitments are necessary. But the other three will not be far behind. UK astronomers have already submitted a bid to Pparc, asking it to match European groundwork funding for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) of radio telescopes, requesting \u00a36m over four years.</p> <p>\"We believe that the science case is so strong that Pparc will support it,\" said Professor Andrew Lyne, astronomer at Jodrell Bank Observatory at the University of Manchester, which is leading the UK contingent on SKA. He does not even want to contemplate a scenario where Pparc refuses its bid. \"We really just have to approach these things optimistically,\" he said.</p> <p>In the long term, researchers hope the UK will shoulder 10% of the total SKA project cost, estimated at several hundred million euros. \"If we put in less than 5%, that will put us really in second rank among the countries involved,\" said Phil Diamond, leader of the UK contingent and chair of the SKA international steering committee.</p> <p>The main construction phase for the SKA behemoth is expected to stretch between 2010 and 2020. The top runners for hosting it are South Africa, Western Australia, Brazil, Argentina and the US, and a decision is expected in early 2006.</p> <p>But this timescale could coincide with the construction of the next generation of optical telescopes, which will require preparatory funding on a similar scale to that for SKA. These \"overwhelmingly\" large telescopes would use collectors up to 100 metres in diameter to investigate heavenly bodies that cannot be seen using existing telescopes.</p> <p>The UK has several options to go with, depending on which countries it wants to collaborate with. For example, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is looking into building a 100-metre telescope, operational by 2020.</p> <p>There are other potential partners, such as the US. According to Ward, Pparc will have to decide on what partner to go with, and the budget implications it will have, very soon.</p> <p>But the list does not end there. The international particle physics community is sketching out a Linear Collider (LC) to succeed the Large Hadron Collider being built at Cern. The LC will aim to provide answers to many questions about the nature of dark energy, extra dimensions and the fundamental nature of space and time.</p> <p>Recently, it was decided that the LC should use low-temperature technologies, which puts the project well in line with UK expertise. Already Pparc has awarded \u00a310m to national accelerator science projects this year to ensure the UK can play a lead role. But, as with the other projects, more money will be needed. \"Within the present science budget we can't possibly be major participants in them all,\" Ward said.</p> <p>Pparc's annual budget is \u00a3300m at the moment, and half of that is earmarked for subscriptions to organisations like the ESO. The remaining \u00a3150m needs to cater to all the funding needs of UK particle physicists and astronomers. The Aurora subscription alone would eat up one sixth of this funding.</p> <p>One way of taking the pressure off funding agencies is to make sure the cost profiles of large international projects do not peak simultaneously. \"These things are all global, so we are all in the same boat in terms of looking at the spending profiles,\" Ward said.</p> <p>The need for a global road map for large-scale projects in astronomy and astrophysics was brought up at two OECD workshops earlier this year. But such a road map is not likely to appear for some time. In the meantime, Pparc will have to hope that the timescales of projects will serendipitously match up, to minimise pressures on its budget, and that its budget settlement next year will contain some good news.</p> <p>While awaiting the new budget, Pparc's science committee is trying to keep the options open so the UK will be able to join all four projects if the funding is there in the future.</p> <p>\"Solving the key problems in particle physics and astronomy is like doing a jigsaw, the pictures on some pieces are more interesting than on others,\" Ward said. \"There are strong arguments for a country with the world's fourth largest economy being at the forefront in several of these global endeavours that will shape our view of the universe and our place in it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Linda Nordling is a reporter on Research Fortnight</p>",
  "<p>It is a university that never sleeps - thousands of students across the world studying remotely at the same institution 24 hours a day. Forget noisy classrooms with teachers trying to gain control; enter peaceful learning environments where the only noise is the hum of PCs and the occasional voice of students asking questions. </p> <p>This is the objective of Edinburgh's Interactive University (IU), a teaching programme that, over the past 18 months, has attracted 75,000 students from more than 23 countries. In sharp contrast to the failure of its English counterpart, UkeU, which had signed up only 900 students when it was scrapped in June, the IU has seen a 75% increase in student numbers over the past year. </p> <p>A spin-off from Heriot Watt University, the IU adapts courses from Scottish schools, colleges and universities, sell ing them online to partner institutions around the globe. Since its introduction early last year, courses have been successfully piloted in south-east Asia, China, India, the Middle East and south America. </p> <p>\"The IU enables international students to obtain degrees from Scottish universities without the expense of studying in Scotland,\" says Professor Roy Leitch, IU's chief executive officer. \"The greatest uptake has been in foundation or undergraduate courses, with students enrolling in either business management or IT.\" </p> <p>While undergraduate courses have the lion's share of students, postgraduate programmes are becoming more popular among international students; the University of Stirling offers an MBA in entrepreneurship and business venturing. At secondary school level, the most popular course has been the Scholar e-learning programme, which now has 60,000 students throughout Scotland. Created by Heriot Watt, Scholar provides e-learning materials to support conventional classroom teaching. </p> <p>The courses have also been piloted in Cumbria, Kent and the Midlands, where 4,000 students have taken part in the scheme. \"The key to the Scholar programme and the other IU courses is that the student enjoys more one-to-one attention from the teacher,\" says Leitch. \"Conventional learning relies on a teacher doing all the teaching. The software does this by teaching modular subjects, with the teacher listening to the student and answering questions.\" He points out the system enables students to learn at their own pace, rather than trying to absorb information from the teacher. </p> <p>Scholar works using two support services. The first is the Scholar forum, a network of regional user groups involving local education advisers and development officers. The second is the staff development programme, which introduces teachers to new material, classroom practices and, importantly, to the idea of working in a \"listening\" environment. </p> <p>\"The IU must have input from a teacher or it wouldn't work,\" argues Leitch. \"The teacher's knowledge of how students learn is used to better advantage, while e-learning teaches the lesson. Computers will never replace teachers in motivating pupils to learn.\" </p> <p>But while Leitch is at pains to point out the advantages of the IU, some sectors of the teaching profession have reservations. Clare Harris, a biology teacher at Harrogate Granby high school, says: \"From a personal point of view, computer training is an extra hassle teachers can do without.\" She also believes the IU prevents students from developing the all-important social skills required in class interaction, as well as skills needed for practical subjects such as sciences. </p> <p>Yet Scotland has seen the number of students opting for sciences increase by 10% over the past 12 months. Moreover, Scholar has seen a 100% take-up by Scottish local authorities, and average pass rates have increased from 84% to 92%. </p> <p>Neil Johnson, a biology teacher at Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen, is an advocate of the programme. \"Scholar suits all learning styles as it enables students to learn from different materials in a self-directed way,\" he says. </p> <p>Scholar, foundation and postgraduate courses are all assessed through written examinations, overseen by the British Council in foreign countries. Every course has exactly the same curriculum as offered in schools, colleges and universities in Scotland - this is seen as crucial to enable the IU to achieve the same teaching standards globally, regardless of whether the course is conducted in Dundee or Dubai. </p> <p>The IU is promoting the reputation of Scotland's leading educational institutions. Heriot Watt, Edinburgh and Aberdeen universities are just three offering courses to other countries. Leitch says: \"The primary focus for us now is in east Asia, providing management courses in areas such as hospitality, retail and tourism.\" He adds: \"Our strategy for China is going to be at university entry level, where there is a large gap in English language and computer competence.\" </p> <p>He perceives new markets in Europe and north America; the IU is also working with the World Bank to discover a financially viable solution to offering courses in Africa. </p> <p>While Leitch freely discloses the IU is only \"scratching the surface\" of the \u00a318bn global e-learning market, he is quick to mention the organisation is a not-for-profit enterprise. </p> <p>As Leith sums it up, \"we will continue to reinvest in programmes to deliver the high quality education for which Scotland is renowned\".</p>"
