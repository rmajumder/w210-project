  "<p>Many of the ideas contained in The Orange Part reflect the existing policies of the party (Lib Dems riven by radical NHS plan, September 3). The Lib Dems already have clear positions in favour of changing the rules of engagement of the UN; using markets for environmental goals; and reforming the EU's common agricultural policy. However, the idea of a social insurance scheme to fund the NHS has already been debated by party and rejected. Having spent the last five years as the party's director of policy, I have never found that the idea has much support in the party. Our health policy is based on the view that successful European health services have been better funded over decades (so they have the higher capacity that allows meaningful choice), and decisions are made at a more local level than in the UK. Emulating that, rather than adopting different and administratively complex funding mechanisms, is at the heart of the Liberal Democrat position that has been agreed over this parliament, and which will take us into the next election.<br> <strong>Dr Richard Grayson</strong><br>Hemel Hempstead, Herts </p> <p>As a member of the Lib Dems' federal executive and vice-chair of the Green Liberal Democrats, I've lost count of the times I've been told not to \"rock the boat\". So imagine my surprise to find that many of the finger-waggers themselves have now published a book attempting to rewrite the party's entire public service policies just months before polling day? Why are they so determined to start a punch up between 19th-century classical liberals and 20th-century social liberals? Surely the task in the 21st century is to reforge liberalism for a new era, which looks set to be marked by struggles over increasingly limited natural resources, a rapidly expanding global population and the effects of climate change? Pretending that Mill, Gladstone or Beveridge have all the answers is the height of folly.<br><strong>James Graham</strong><br>London </p> <p>Although I appreciate you need to label different points of view in the Liberal Democrats, it is surely now inaccurate to paint the old left of the party as the \"vocal radical\" wing. Other than moaning about new ideas in the pages of your newspaper, it is difficult to think of much that has come out of them in recent times that is actually radical. Most of their policy ideas are premised on protecting postwar public institutions from the modern world and most of their campaigning ideas are rooted in the protest politics of 1970s. Vocal maybe; radical these people are not. The regressive wing might be more apt.<br><strong>Andy Mayer</strong><br>Director, Liberal Future</p>",

  "<p>Sean Harrigan has made some powerful enemies. As president of Calpers, the largest public pension fund in the United States, he has become a thorn in the side of corporate America, taking on some of its best-known and biggest egos. </p> <p>Earlier this year the fund locked horns with Michael Eisner, the beleaguered boss of Walt Disney, leading the call for his resignation. Calpers also played a pivotal role in the ousting of former New York Stock Exchange chief Dick Grasso as he became embroiled in a bitter dispute over his eye-popping salary. </p> <p>In April, the fund pressed other investors to back its campaign against Sanford Weill, the boss of Citigroup, the biggest banking firm in the world. Weill, Calpers said, \"should be held accountable\" for the numerous Wall Street scandals in which the bank played a role. With profits returning and the Citigroup share price heading up, few others agreed. He remains chairman. </p> <p>Among other head-on collisions, Calpers has filed a suit against Time Warner alleging fraud, and even withheld votes for the re-election of Warren Buffett to the board of Coca-Cola, inviting the opprobrium of America's favourite investor. The list, a who's who of the US business community, goes on. </p> <p>Calpers, an acronym for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, has a long history of shareholder activism - taking an active role in the companies it invests in instead of the traditional passive approach. It cites studies that show active share ownership improves both performance and share prices in the long term. With $170bn (\u00a395bn) under management, it wields the kind of power that directors take note of, whether they be at the exchange or corporations. In the year to June 30, it earned a return of 16.7%. </p> <p>The fund started to engage company management two decades ago when it embarked on a campaign to rid corporate America of \"poison pills\", the clauses adopted by boards to prevent takeovers. </p> <p>More recently, though, Calpers has redoubled its efforts in response to the unprecedented wave of financial scandals in the US. Amid the accounting woes at the likes of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia, the fraud uncovered at mutual funds and the widespread sleaze at Wall Street's biggest banks, Calpers has emerged as corporate America's self-styled moral compass. </p> <p>\"I think we are probably the most active fund in the US; one of the most active in the world,\" Harrigan says. \"We believe very strongly that first of all it does enhance long-term value of our investments but secondly, if we don't do it, who will? We are the largest in the US and as a result of being the largest I think we have a responsibility.\" </p> <p><strong>Focus list</strong><br> </p> <p>As the firestorm raged last summer over the $188m compensation package paid to Grasso at the New York Stock Exchange, Calpers exercised that responsibility and waded in. Grasso had been resisting intense pressure to quit. Calpers held a press conference demanding that he step down and within 24 hours he was gone. </p> <p>Harrigan is still aghast. \"It was outrageous,\" he says. \"Here you have the largest stock exchange in the world that should set the absolute right example. Then you've got a guy like Dick Grasso who's got this $188m package. I said it as clearly as I could: it was an example of the pig being in the trough and our job was to get him out of the trough.\" </p> <p>The other tangible success for Calpers this year has been Disney. Led by Calpers, shareholders who were frustrated by the poor performance of the entertainment and media group withheld an unprecedented 43% of the vote for Eisner's re-election to the board. Disney, which had stubbornly defended Eisner, reacted swiftly, stripping him of the chairmanship although leaving him as chief executive. </p> <p>Harrigan says Calpers was pleased by the size of the withheld vote but still describes Disney as a work in progress. </p> <p>\"I was disappointed that the board would be naive enough to believe that splitting the role of chairman and chief executive would satisfy our concerns because we think that action will have no impact whatsoever on Disney's performance. Eisner is the problem, and there's only one way to correct that problem.\" </p> <p>The fund's attention more lately has turned to Royal Dutch/Shell, where Calpers is engaged in efforts to reform the board. Like Disney, Shell is on Calpers' annual \"focus list\", which identifies the biggest problem companies. The other two on this year's list are home appliance maker Maytag and engineering firm Emerson Electric. </p> <p>Shell was sent reeling earlier this year by a series of downgrades to its oil and gas reserves that led to the departure of several top executives. Calpers, however, is dissatisfied with the pace of change at the company and the transparency of its review process. It is putting pressure on Shell to follow through with proposals to simplify its complex dual-board structure. The company has not been \"particularly responsive\", Harrigan says. </p> <p>\"We aren't convinced of Shell's commitment to reform. We have some real concerns about Shell's performance but more importantly about its structure. It's hard to even figure out who you need to be talking to at Shell. We will continue to have a dialogue but they have a long way to go.\" </p> <p>As Calpers has pressed harder, though, corporate America has begun to push back. The resistance appears to be part of a wider business retreat from the rules and regulations put in place to improve standards of corporate governance in the wake of the Enron collapse. </p> <p>The Business Roundtable, a powerful coalition of US chief executives, and the national chamber of commerce have both launched bitter attacks on the Californian pension fund, arguing that the corporate governance movement is out of control. \"This is not about good corporate governance,\" the head of the Business Roundtable, John Castellani, recently said. \"This is hysteria being driven by union-dominated pension funds. They are wrapping themselves in the cloak of corporate governance to gain power and influence.\" </p> <p>The Californian Republican party has also gone on the offensive, accusing the Democrat-dominated Calpers board of political grandstanding. Most of the pension funds that have backed Calpers, including New York and New Jersey, are from Democratic states. </p> <p>Harrigan, a blunt-speaking union boss, appears resigned to the criticism. Detractors, he replies, are trying to \"protect the status quo\" by discrediting the fund. \"You have to try and assess the motives of the people who are making those observations,\" he says. \"If someone was to poll the average American on whether they believe executive compensation is totally out of line, recognising it was 40 times the average wage for a production worker in 1980 and 520 times that last year, I think the average American probably lines up with Calpers. </p> <p>\"Then you look at the fraud and what impact that has had on workers and pension funds and what has gone on in corporate boardrooms. What has happened over the past four years has been absolutely despicable and the criticism of Calpers comes predominantly from individuals who have benefited greatly as a result of the excesses and the lack of accountability that have taken place. </p> <p>\"I certainly understand their motivation. While I don't agree with it, I guess if I had enjoyed the sanctimony of the positions that they've enjoyed over the last 60 years I might be inclined to protect the status quo also.\" </p> <p>Critics have seized on Calpers' stance on auditors. The fund last year decided to withhold votes for re-election to the board for any members of audit committees that allowed accounting companies to provide other services, such as tax or management consulting, potentially compromising their independence. </p> <p>A key finding in the Enron and WorldCom scandals was that auditors were simply too much in the thrall of their clients. Calpers' analysis suggested that 29% of fees still come from consulting services. </p> <p>The problem was more pervasive than Calpers realised. It resulted in the fund withholding votes from directors at 90% of the companies it owns shares in, including Buffett at Coke and Steve Jobs at Apple, provoking widespread ridicule. Buffett described the vote as plain \"silly\". The Wall Street Journal said the \"withhold\" against Buffett was taking governance reform to \"absurd new lengths\". </p> <p>Harrigan responds: \"Buffet is a great investor, he really is. Is he a great advocate of proper levels of checks and balances in terms of corporate governance? I don't think that is his strong point. We weren't suggesting those members be removed from the board. We were making a statement about how important we think it is that you draw a bright line between audit and non-audit related services.\" </p> <p>The criticisms appear to have had an effect. Calpers is unlikely to continue the aggressive stance on auditors and will set out a more selective policy in October or November. \"Some people think we did the right thing, some people think we did the wrong thing. I don't know. I think we made a lot of noise. This is the first time we've done it. Maybe what we did was absolutely the right thing to do for the first proxy season. Maybe now we need to look at refining it.\" </p> <p><strong>Overseas targets</strong><br> </p> <p>The fund's next big focus will be executive compensation, an incendiary issue on both sides of the Atlantic. Calpers is planning a separate focus list of the most egregious cases of excessive pay which will be published later this year or early next. </p> <p>Harrigan says Calpers will also focus more efforts on shaking up poorly managed companies overseas, including Britain - it was part of the failed revolt against James Murdoch's accession at BSkyB. Calpers was a founding member in May of the International Forum for Active Shareowners to encourage more cross-border cooperation and holds about 25% of its equities outside the US. </p> <p>Harrigan judges the most important imminent issue for investors in the US to be the so-called access to the proxy. </p> <p>At present, US shareholders have no means of ousting directors. But, under a rule being considered by the securities and exchange commission, shareholders will be able to nominate an alternative for a board position if more than 35% of the vote is withheld from him or her in the previous year. Corporate America and, Harrigan suspects, the Bush administration are lobbying hard against the rule being adopted. </p> <p>Opponents argue it will be a Trojan horse, allowing special interest groups to find a way on to boards, something Harrigan describes as \"bunk\". </p> <p>\"This is huge,\" he says. \"It is the one issue that I believe has the potential of aligning interests of shareholders and management. It has the potential to create an environment in which we don't see the kind of fraud we saw at Enron and WorldCom and has the potential of making sure that executive compensation is reasonable and tied directly to performance. Without question, it is the issue that has the potential for creating the kind of environment that we think needs to be created in the boardrooms of American corporations.\" </p> <p>If it is passed, Eisner at least could face a genuine fight for survival next year. </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 57<br> <strong>Education:</strong> Economics degree, Whitman College, Washington State<br> <strong>Career:</strong> 30 years' experience in the supermarket sector, including seven years at Safeway Supermarkets; joined Union of Food and Commercial Workers in mid-1970s, specialising in member recruitment, collective bargaining; director of field operations, coordinator of activities relating to 2000 national presidential election, UFCW; international vice president and executive director, UFCW; February 2003, president, Calpers board of administration<br> <strong>Family:</strong> Wife Kathy, children Kathleen and Ryan<br> <strong>Interests:</strong> Golf, sailing</p>",

  "The books used to talk about how the American Republican party was really two parties. The first of them was very decent and sometimes very grand indeed, and could answer truthfully to the term compassionate conservative. It was the party of Theodore Roosevelt and Nelson Rockefeller. The second party was decent too, in its way, but it was decidedly not so grand as the first. It was the party of people like Dwight Eisenhower and, stretching a point, Richard Nixon. <p>Identifiable traces of these two mid-20th century parties, particularly the latter, still live on in George Bush's Republican party of 2004. But they survive there on sufferance, in a transformed party. Even so, you could argue that the Republicans of today are still based on a kind of alliance, though the new one bears no relation to the old. The first arm, which has all of the power and most of the dynamism, is the religious conservative activist party that gathered in Madison Square Garden this week to acclaim Bush, now himself the de facto leader of the religious right. The second, still necessary to the first for purely electoral reasons, consists of people who vote Republican in the belief that the party is as nice as it portrays itself, when in fact it is no such thing. </p> <p>One needs to beware of applying the political mores of one culture to those of another. Even so, there was no mistaking the sheer aggressiveness of the Republicans this week. This quality showed above all in the treatment reserved for John Kerry, who was subjected to a four-day stream of orches trated personal insult that makes British politics appear truly gentlemanly by comparison. Nothing that happens in a convention hall happens without the party managers' approval. Every placard they wave has been handed out by party officials a few minutes before. So the sudden outbreak of delegates wearing sticking plasters with Purple Hearts on them - implying that Kerry exaggerated his Vietnam wounds in order to win his medals - could hardly have been an unofficial move either, and stands in marked contrast to earlier denials by the Bush campaign that it was promoting the apparently \"non-partisan\" anti-Kerry moves by rightwing Vietnam veterans. </p> <p>Of course, it was not an unofficial move at all. What the delegates expressed with their nasty stickers, the party's leaders actually said, just as nastily, from the platform. Speech after speech besmirched Kerry's military record - a record which he had placed at the centre of his own campaign in an explicit bid for electoral credibility both as a man and as a potential president - none more brutally than the Georgia Democratic senator Zell Miller, who cast Kerry as \"wrong, weak and wobbly\" and as a man with a \"yes-no-maybe\" approach to the war on terrorism. </p> <p>In a truly revealing turn of events, after years in which rightwing America has endlessly celebrated the unquiet Vietnam veterans as a betrayed generation of real male patriots, mainstream Republican demonology has now cast Kerry as a man whose preoccupation with his own exploits in Vietnam make him fundamentally unreliable both as man and potential leader. The fact that rightwing America can so shamelessly taunt Kerry in this way, led by a non-combatant president who refuses to condemn the negative campaign and by a vice-president who fanned the flames in his own speech this week (\"I had other priorities\" is how Cheney icily describes his own Vietnam years) is a reminder that what is crucially important to Republicans is not, as they like to say, the tradition of armed service but, in reality, their claim to exclusive ownership of the politics of US defence, security and war. </p> <p>Throughout the week, it goes almost without saying, there was not a single critical reference to the American military, not even in relation to Abu Ghraib. Bush himself probably saw no element of irony in his closing encomium of \"our military which finds a way, or makes one\". Such self-confidence reminds us how much more vicious American politics since 9/11 would have been if Al Gore had been in the White House when the hijacked planes were flown into the World Trade Centre. Would the Republicans have rallied behind Gore as the Democrats rallied behind Bush that day? Not a chance. Within days they would have begun to blame Bill Clinton for the attack on America. Some of them, indeed, do so anyway. Browsing through a New York Barnes and Noble bookstore the other day I encountered titles like \"Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror\", \"Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton compromised American's National Security\" or \"Intelligence Failure: How Clinton's National Security Policy Set the Stage for 9/11\". </p> <p>For such people, the mere act of imagining John Kerry as their duly elected \"commander-in-chief\" is offensive. Miller and others have said as much. Cheney, in the speech of great ruthlessness, went further than most. And again, all this provides a glimpse of the vengeful and vindictive way that a defeated Republican party might be tempted to treat a President Kerry. The Republican party today is not at ease in any settlement other than one whose terms it has dictated. You can already sense the impeachment reflex beginning to take on life. </p> <p>In some ways it is as though the modern Republican party has become the political expression of the \"misplaced power\" of the military-industrial complex against which Eisenhower famously warned as he left the White House in 1961. </p> <p>In any other political culture, you would characterise the Republicans as a militarist party, and in that context it would be perverse not to reflect upon whether this central development in American life did not have far more sinister implications, not least when so many references to the war on terror this week have been accompanied by testosterone-fuelled chants of \"U-S-A, U-S-A\". </p> <p>Yet the Republican party which Bush leads should really be seen as the party that tries to unite the military-industrial and religious imperatives in American life. If Bush was careful this week not to take the attacks on Kerry too far, he was much less restrained in his meticulous willingness to tick each of the boxes that matter to the religious party he now leads. </p> <p>But it was not merely his comments about the unborn child and gay marriage that marked this key role. Time and again Bush also deployed his well-established \"double-coding\" technique, dotting his speech with remarks which may not sound to the uninitiated as though they have a Christian conservative meaning, but which initiates will easily read differently. </p> <p>\"We must win this culture war,\" the Republican senator Sam Brownback told a private Family, Faith and Freedom rally in New York this week. For many in Bush's party, this is now the central task of a second term. \"We ask that you continue to provide strength to President Bush and the first family,\" intoned the blessing with which the final convention evening began. \"Guide, protect, and grant wisdom to him as he leads America and the world against the forces of evil ... And father, we pray your will is accomplished in this convention and throughout this great country.\" Much of what was said in Madison Square Garden this week was a masterpiece of Orwellian double-speak. A few things, on the other hand, meant exactly what they said. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Children make it different. Like the tragedies of Columbine and Dunblane, the terror that stalks the classrooms of besieged Middle School 1 in Beslan, North Ossetia, is uniquely disturbing. <p>Who in these torrid days of random, global violence has not become accustomed, even inured, to the suicide bombings in Iraq or a host of other troublespots? Yet who, anywhere in the world, is not touched, angered or frightened - or all three - by the thought of young kids traumatised by masked killers wearing bomb-belts? </p> <p>When the victims are children, the sort of horror on show in Beslan, real or threatened, represents the adult world's ultimate betrayal of innocence, its final failure to nurture and protect. Here is a shared disgrace, borne of a universal grief. Here is an international crying shame, beseeching an urgent remedy. </p> <p>The Chechen conflict, in which the Ossetian siege is inextricably bound up, has become internationalised in many other ways since it reignited, in its modern incarnation, in the early 1990s. Like Czechoslovakia in a different time, the Caucasian lands of Chechnya, North and South Ossetia, Ingushetia and Dagestan cannot be dismissed as distant countries of which we know little and care less. What happens there matters here. </p> <p>\"Their suffering is our suffering,\" Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said yesterday. \"The awesome responsibility of President Putin and his government is our responsibility, too.\" </p> <p>The mere fact of non-stop international media coverage makes Beslan school a shared reality around the world. The inescapable fact that the Chechen conflict once again pits Muslim peoples against Christians or plain non-believers, setting \"Islam\" against the \"west\", sounds an only too familiar post-9/11 global echo. </p> <p>Putin pins the blame for the escalating crisis, perhaps the gravest of his presidency, not on home-grown Chechen fighters but, primarily, on an international Islamist conspiracy linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>The evidence for his contention is thin and often contradictory. But one thing is undoubtedly true. Since plunging recklessly back into Chechnya in 1994, Putin, his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and the once proud Red Army have caused such untold misery, such rank injustice, such fury and despair that, like the Americans in Iraq, they created a breeding ground and magnet for the religious extremists they struggle to extirpate. </p> <p>In effect, it was Russian generals and their turncoat allies who internationalised a war that should never have begun and which could have been peaceably resolved long ago. For this foolishness, Russia's conscript soldiers still pay a terrible price. </p> <p>The risk of a spreading, regional conflagration grows with every outrage, every unanswered act of blood - and with every broken child. Since the time of the tsars, the mountain tribes of the Caucasus have fought for land, faith and just for the hell of it. In A Hero Of Our Time, novelist Mikhail Lermontov wrote admiringly in 1840 of the bravery of his opponents along Russia's lawless southern flank. </p> <p>But now Caucasian instability threatens ever more broadly. Neighbouring Georgia, home to last November's \"rose revolution\", is no model of stability. And by coincidence, the Beslan siege has forced the postponement of a presidential visit to Turkey, Russia's historic Ottoman rival. Putin wants to build up trade and other links. But primarily, he needs Turkey as a southern bulwark of stability and security in a region sliding dangerously beyond Moscow's control. </p> <p>Ten long years of destructive, on-off conflict, egregious human rights abuses, massive refugee displacements and blatant flouting of international law have also rendered Chechnya a matter of undeniable international concern. Organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the OSCE have kept a brave and faithful tally of the human toll and political cost of Russia's heedless policy. Again and again, campaigners have lobbied western governments to draw a diplomatic line, to sponsor a political process, to honestly recognise Chechnya for what it ever more evidently is - a threat to international peace and security, as defined by the UN. Again and again, those same governments, including Britain's, have mostly preferred to look the other way. </p> <p>When Tony Blair talks of Britain's \"moral responsibility\" in Darfur and Iraq; when he speaks, as most famously in Chicago in 1999, of the criteria for intervention; when he sends troops dashing off to Kabul and Freetown, where in all this is there a thought for Chechnya? Ten years of conflict, tens of thousands dead and no end remotely in sight. </p> <p>When Straw yesterday spoke of the \"expanded range of issues\" on which the UN will now consider the use of outside force under chapter VII - including \"the overthrow of democratically elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe (and) refugee crises\" - can he credibly exclude Chechnya which, in truth, arguably qualifies in all categories? </p> <p>Russia has always maintained that the Chechen conflict is an internal matter, to be resolved internally. But now that Putin, by asking for international support, has for the first time effectively invited the security council to consider the issue, western leaders have a clear choice. </p> <p>Britain and others can hide behind the pretence that, as Putin maintains, violence in the Caucasus is just another front in the US-led \"war on terror\" - and close their eyes to causes and remedies. They can give Putin what he wants, which is carte blanche to do whatever he deems necessary. Or they can find the courage to change the habit of the past decade. They can dispense with the sort of mealy-mouthed, turpitudinous shuffling-about indulged in by France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at their recent meeting with Putin. And they can insist instead that in return for active western support, Russia must finally accept the obvious: that Chechnya is a pressing, international problem requiring an agreed, collective, non-violent, international response. </p> <p>Is it so absurd to suggest that EU troops, or even forces organised through Nato, be deployed under a UN peacekeeping mandate? Is it practically impossible to set in train some form of externally mediated peace dialogue, currently absent? </p> <p>Chechnya offers a key test of how, if at all, new, much-discussed post-Iraq rules governing future humanitarian and security interventions can be made to work. Certainly Chechnya is a devilish hard case to crack. Certainly it would be a fraught undertaking.

  "<p>Yukos warned yesterday that it is no longer able to pay staff wages and that oil production could stop any day. </p> <p>The latest problems to beset Russia's biggest oil company sent the price of crude racing ahead again on the global markets. </p> <p>Yukos said prosecutors wanted to seize 76bn roubles ($2.6bn) from the accounts of Yukos subsidiaries as part of the process of resolving a larger tax bill for 2000. </p> <p>This follows a Moscow district court case on Tuesday during which prosecutors accused Yukos accountant Irena Golub of concealing funds \"acquired by criminal means\" on the accounts of Yukos subsidiaries. </p> <p>Yukos said the court action was paralysing company operations \"because it makes it impossible for its subsidiaries not only to pay suppliers, vendors and contractors, but also to pay wages to its employees\". </p> <p>The trouble further unnerved jumpy crude markets, sending the price of Nymex October oil up by 60 cents to $44.60 a barrel. At one point on Wednesday the price of oil jumped by $2 after United States government data unexpectedly showed that crude stocks fell last week. \"The Yukos factor is helping to push prices higher,\" an industry expert in New York confirmed. </p> <p>The dispute over tax at the Russian oil group is seen by some as part of a campaign by the Kremlin to undermine Yukos and its jailed founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for dabbling in politics.

  "'Wow!\" exclaimed my grandson, \"You've got one of those. Cool!\" What I have is a turntable that plays vinyl records, stacked, along with the tape deck, CD and radio player, that make up my 12-year-old sound system. He is impressed. How does it work? I reveal the wonders of needle, grooved tracks and two sides of a recording to someone for whom all this is completely new. And cool - as is the collection of vinyl recordings in their cardboard covers, fraying at the corners. <p>This turntable plays not only at 33rpm but also 45 for my collection of seven-inch singles, wonderful songs from Peggy Lee, Edith Piaf and Kiri singing Gershwin. I'm only sad to have mislaid that small plastic disc for those seven-inch records that, oddly, had a two-inch hole in the centre. That means much of my Bob Dylan and the original music from The Magic Roundabout goes unplayed. Sad. </p> <p>It's even sadder the next day, when the man from Bang and Olufsen comes to check it all out. He has an entirely different take from my grandson: \"Oh, goodness, you still have one of those.\" (He, of course, is in the business of selling me a hugely expensive modern version.) He tells me it is now impossible to buy replacement needles, and that, when the company announced, years ago, that they would be discontinuing them, the price shot up amid the general scramble to stock up quickly before supplies ran out. Since I was unaware of all this, I am left with my single, cherished needle. </p> <p>We were taught about built-in obsolescence at school. It was the way economies were structured, so that technical innovation could make its way in the marketplace, drive out the old and decrepit goods that people clung to in their ignorance, and thus keep the wheels of productivity, with all its hangers-on of marketing, advertising and such, booming. But the fact is that new goods aren't always improved goods. I'm told that vinyl recordings are now valued and collected once again. I could, at moments of redecorating over the decades, so easily have chucked all mine away. How thankful I am that I didn't. And I treat that remaining needle with particular care. Now the word is that the CD is over. Not in my home it isn't. Beware people proclaiming new and improved ways of doing what was perfectly satisfactory already. They are usually trying to sell you something you don't need. </p> <p>My kitchen is another treasure trove of the supposedly out of date, including an old egg whisk, tatty and stained - the sort of thing a kitchen-themed pub would have on the wall - and the classic Victorian lemon squeezer. I defy any designer - and that includes Philippe Starck - to design a better way of getting juice out of a lemon than the old-fashioned glass dish and its ridged cone. Sometimes the best design comes first. So what shall I be wearing to this week's opening of the first Jean Muir shop? Will it be the two-year-old trousers and top, or the 15-year-old little blue dress? Neither will look out of fashion. Timeless elegance remains just that. It disproves the fashionistas' advice that says if you haven't worn it for a year, throw it out. I say, keep hold and you won't be sorry. </p> <p>Taking the issue beyond the trivia of my own life, I think it's time built-in obsolescence was rethought. With global problems of ecology and disparate wealth now so glaring, we need to hold on longer to what we have. Why throw away perfectly good and functioning possessions simply because the frenetic world of consumerism pressures you to do so? If every household held on to its white goods one year longer, the landfill problem would ease. If people delayed updating their car we might start to slow down the western world's accelerating drive to consume. Given that such decisions would save us money, we could then afford to buy better quality goods next time, which in turn would last longer. </p> <p>The rise of the car-boot sale, the trade in secondhand clothes, the flourishing of shops such as Curtain Exchange and Oxfam bear witness to the abundance of things discarded long before their use is ended. I know networks of families who regularly swap their children's clothes as they are outgrown by one and become just right for another. My mother, who would never buy antiques because \"you don't know where they've been\" - would not approve. But her thinking has gone, along with her generation. Now we can swap and hand-down, buy secondhand and used, without that furtive feeling of doing something not quite nice. Which reminds me: where did I put those Biba boots? My daughter might be interested.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:joan.bakewell@virgin.net\">joan.bakewell@virgin.net</a></p>",
  "Soaking in a tub of piping-hot spring water is as much a part of Japanese life as karaoke, but several unscrupulous innkeepers in some of the country's best-known spa resorts are in hot water of their own after they admitted filling their baths from the hot tap. <p>At least seven of the 55 inns and public bath houses in the spa resort of Ikaho, about 80 miles north of Tokyo, said recently they had filled baths with tap water after mineral-rich springs started to run dry. Their admission prompted 4,000 cancellations from appalled tourists. </p> <p>Ikaho, a popular retreat for writers and artists, is known for its iron-rich waters, which were first piped to the surface 400 years ago. Tens of thousands of people visit the town every year seeking the purported therapeutic effects of the reddish-brown water. </p> <p>Several inns in the spa resort of Shirahone said they had added bath salts to give the waters their trademark milky-white hue. The waters, which are said to have medicinal qualities, reportedly started to lose their natural colour 10 years ago. </p> <p>After that, the trickle of embarrassing revelations became a deluge. Other inns owned up to misleading guests, angering Japan's millions of hot-spring enthusiasts and prompting calls for tighter regulations. </p> <p>The innkeepers have not broken any laws, however. Under a 1948 law, anyone who discovers a source of water 25C or hotter can open a bath house. They are required to register the bathing facilities when they open, but do not have to renew their licence. When the natural spring water runs dry, there is nothing, legally, to stop them using tap water. </p> <p>The lengths to which some will go to attract visitors reflects an urgent need to keep the waters flowing as the Japanese show no sign of abandoning the centuries-old tradition of stripping off and lowering themselves into piping hot water, often several times a day. </p> <p>There are now more than 22,000 registered inns and bath houses at 3,000 resorts across the country, almost double the number of 40 years ago. </p> <p>Yet according to Japan's Fair Trade Commission, only about a third of the country's hot springs use pure, undiluted spring water from natural sources. </p> <p>The industry was rocked two years ago when seven people died after contracting legionnaires' disease at a hot-spring resort. </p> <p>Another inn caused a public outcry when it refused to allow former leprosy patients to use its baths, fearing they would upset other guests. And the increasing use of chlorine has some bathers worried that a soak may cause skin complaints, not soothe them. </p> <p>The environment ministry, however, plans to question every spa operator in the country in an effort to discover the extent of the deception. </p> <p>The inns, though, are likely to survive the inquest: a newspaper poll published this week found that visitors were more concerned about the quality of the food on offer than the water.</p>",
  "<p>The US trial of British firm Wembley, which is accused of planning to bribe influential Rhode Island politicians into passing expansion plans for its slot machine lottery operations, has been put back to January. </p> <p>The trial had been scheduled to start this month in Providence, Rhode Island, but has been stalled by legal argument. The delay extends the uncertainty surrounding Wembley, which was the subject of a bidding battle between MGM Mirage and the US consortium BLB, including South African gaming tycoon Sol Kerzner. BLB abandoned its \u00a3309m bid in July, despite having won approval from shareholders representing 83% of Wembley. It blamed the \"political environment\" in Rhode Island for the change of heart. </p> <p>Wembley chairman and chief executive Claes Hultman yesterday confirmed the US state would be forced to strip the company of its licence to operate the video lottery terminals should it be convicted. However, he added the state would \"have to reinstate the licence immediately\" because of its heavy reliance on revenues from the thousands of lottery slot machines at Wembley's Lincoln Park site. </p> <p>Lincoln Park generates more than 90% of Wembley profits and is the third-largest revenue source for Rhode Island, after sales tax and income tax. Wembley had attracted bidders after securing assurances from the US courts that it would not face a fine greater than $8m (\u00a34m). </p> <p>Wembley benefited from a recent court ruling which is likely to delay a Rhode Island ballot over whether to grant Harrah's Entertainment a licence for the state's first casino - a move thought likely to draw punters away from Lincoln Park. Mr Hultman said he believed a ballot would be delayed at least two years. He was speaking after Wembley posted a 4.7% drop in pre-tax profit to \u00a317.6m. The average weekly revenue from Lincoln Park lottery terminals rose 14.5% to $5.8m. Shares in the company closed down 3.5p at 659p.</p>",
  "<p>All new academics should have their undergraduate tuition fees written off in a bid to attract more people into the profession, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) said today.</p> <p>New research by the AUT shows that the number of new entrants into academia is falling, and the population of lecturers ageing. The proportion of academics over-50 in universities is increasing; while the number under 50 is rapidly decreasing.</p> <p>The AUT made its call in a submission to a review by the Department for Education and Skills. The review, set up to tackle the shortage of academics, is being carried out by Sir Alan Langlands.</p> <p>The AUT's submission read: \"It has become increasingly clear to the AUT that higher education urgently needs a national incentive scheme to attract new entrants into the profession - and to raise the profile of an academic career. </p> <p>\"With the onset of higher tuition fees, this becomes even more urgent. The AUT believes that the proposal most likely to meet these criteria would be a fee write-off scheme. The government could agree to write off a graduate's tuition fee debt of \u00a39,000, at a rate of, say, \u00a33,000 a year over three years.\"</p> <p>They claim that over the period from 1995-6 to 2002-3, the number of new academics entering employment in the UK fell by 11%.</p> <p>Typical shortage subjects include chemistry, physics, mathematics and information technology, which the AUT said should be given priority consideration for such a scheme.</p> <p>In a bid to recruit more academics, those entering education, computing, information technology, business, mathematics, engineering, clinical medicine and clinical dentistry have been eligible for \"golden hellos\" since last year worth up to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>But the AUT want this to be expanded to other areas including French, Spanish and German, architecture, built environment and planning, humanities, physics, and health and community studies. </p> <p>The government has already made a select few key concessions over who pays top-up fees, in a bid to prevent recruitment crises elsewhere in the public sector. </p> <p>School teachers who teach English, maths, languages, design and technology and also science, are currently eligible for their fees to be written off by the government. The National Health Service already meet the tuition fee costs of nurses and midwifes, and also pay the fees for medical and dentistry students in their fourth and fifth years.</p>",
  "<p>GCSE coursework is neither demanding nor stimulating, is rife with plagiarism and should be dropped, according to the head of the school with the best results in the country. </p> <p>Dr Martin Stephen, master of St Paul's school in Barnes, south west London, said some of his most able pupils were bored by coursework. </p> <p>He told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"Coursework at GCSE has completely had its time and should be abolished as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"It's not demanding or stimulating. It's routine and very often appears to invite young people to go for length rather than quality. We are a selective school, so inevitably have highly selected students. The more able the student the more they will produce - not just coursework, but a full length book.\"</p> <p>Dr Stephen, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, which today published GCSE scores for its member schools, said the coursework element was rife with cheating - particularly for those who had access to the internet.</p> <p>\"It's almost impossible to control or contain the plagiarism now... It is also discriminatory; infinitely easier for young people with home internet access or, for that matter, in a house with books. The exams shouldn't measure that environment.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Coursework was a good idea but it hasn't worked.\"</p> <p>However, he did say the exams should be retained, despite the fact that other independent schools are opting to replace GCSEs and A-levels with the international baccalaureate. </p> <p>Some exams - including chemistry - were, he said, still \"quite demanding\", but he refused to name the ones he believed were not. </p> <p>At St Paul's, where boarding fees are \u00a319,131 a year and 165 candidates achieved an average of 81.9 points at GCSE - the equivalent of at least 10 A-stars - pupils are encouraged to sit up to 11 exams to give them the broadest possible education. The government has set a benchmark of students attaining five A-star to Cs as a desirable pass rate.</p> <p>A Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said coursework formed an important part of GCSE exams and could be \"a valuable way of assessing achievement and skills that cannot readily be demonstrated in an examination, including practical and oral skills and the ability to tackle extended pieces of written work\".</p> <p>\"There are measures in place throughout the system to ensure that plagiarism is detected and dealt with. There are clear guidelines and procedures in place for dealing with cases of dishonesty, malpractice, and maladministration,\" she added.</p> <p>\"We have asked the working group on 14 to 19 reform to make recommendations on assessment arrangements, including coursework, as well as the overall amount of assessment manageable for teachers and learners alike.\"</p> <p>GCSEs were introduced in 1986 - bringing with them the first widespread use of coursework.</p> <p>The future of GCSEs and A-levels is currently being debated.

  "The European commission today launched legal action against the government over \"unacceptable\" failings in dealing with nuclear waste at Sellafield. <p>Government plans submitted to Brussels in June to improve waste monitoring were rejected as an inadequate response to long-standing commission complaints about breaches of EU nuclear safety rules.</p> <p>After the legal step was decided at talks in Brussels, the commission vice-president responsible for energy policy, Loyola de Palacio, said she had a duty to protect the interests of citizens.</p> <p>But she also made clear that the commission would call off the court action even at this stage if forthcoming talks with the British authorities produced a clear timetable for complying with nuclear safety legislation.</p> <p>The dispute is over verification of the safety of spent nuclear fuel which is currently stored in a \"pond\" at the Sellafield site, run by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) in Cumbria.</p> <p>The government has acknowledged the problems of accounting precisely for the waste, but ministers are annoyed that the commission is pursuing BNFL using rules designed to ensure nuclear waste does not get into the wrong hands. </p> <p>There is no suggestion that the waste has gone astray - just concern in Brussels that EU inspectors cannot comprehensively verify the state of the waste as required.</p> <p>The inspectors complain that they do not have sufficient physical access to the \"pond\" site at Sellafield, which they are meant to check to ensure nuclear material is not being diverted from peaceful uses.</p> <p>Ms De Palacio said of the legal action: \"The commission has to protect the general interest of EU citizens, which cannot be subordinated to political, technical or other considerations.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We will be holding discussions with the British authorities.

  "Governments may have to persuade people to eat less meat because of increasing demands on water supplies, according to agricultural scientists investigating how the world can best feed itself. <p>They say countries with little water may choose not to grow crops but trade in \"virtual water\", importing food from countries that have large amounts of water to save their supplies for domestic or high-value uses. </p> <p>With about 840 million people in the world undernourished, and a further 2 billion expected to be born within 20 years, finding water to grow food will be one of the greatest challenges facing governments. </p> <p>Currently up to 90% of all managed water is used to grow food. \"There will be enough food for everyone on average in 20 years' time, but unless we change the way that we grow it, there will be a lot more malnourished people,\" said Dr David Molden, principal scientist with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), which is part-funded by the British government and is investigating global options for feeding growing populations. </p> <p>\"The bottom line is that groundwater levels are plummeting and our rivers are already overstressed, yet there is a lot of complacency about the future,\" the IWMI report says. </p> <p>\"Western diets, which depend largely on meat, are already putting great pressures on the environment. Meat-eaters consume the equivalent of about 5,000 litres of water a day compared to the 1,000-2,000 litres used by people on vegetarian diets in developing countries. All that water has to come from somewhere.\" </p> <p>The consensus emerging among scientists is that it will be almost impossible to feed future generations the typical diet eaten in western Europe and North America without destroying the environment. </p> <p>A meat and vegetable diet, which most people move to when economically possible, requires more water than crops such as wheat and maize. On average, it takes 1,790 litres of water to grow 1kg of wheat compared with 9,680 litres for 1kg of beef. </p> <p>In its report, the IWMI says it is unlikely that people will change their eating habits because of concerns about water supplies. \"And in many sub-Saharan countries, where the pressure on water will increase most rapidly in the next 20 years, people actually need to be eating more, not less,\" the report says. </p> <p>Anders Berntell, the director of the International Water Institute, based in Stockholm, said: \"The world's future water supply is a problem that's . . . greater than we've begun to realise. We've got to reduce the amount of water we devote to growing food. The world is simply running out of water.\" </p> <p>Research suggests that up to 24% more water will be needed to grow the world's food in 20 years, but many of the fastest-growing countries are unable to devote more water to agriculture without sacrificing ecosystems which may be important for providing water or fish. </p> <p>The option of increased world trade in virtual water seems logical, the scientists say, but they recognise that it depends on countries having the money to import their food. \"The question remains whether the countries that will be hardest hit by water scarcity will be able to afford virtual water,\" the report says. </p> <p>The best options for feeding the world, it says, are a combination of hi-tech and traditional water conservation methods. Improved crop varieties, better tillage methods and more precise irrigation could reduce water consumption and improve yields. Drought-resistant seeds, water harvesting schemes and small-plot technologies such as treadle pumps (simple foot pumps) all have the potential to boost yields by 100%, the report says. </p> <p>The scientists did not examine the use of GM foods, which have been hailed by some companies as the way to avoid big food shortages. \"Even without GM foods, in many parts of the world there is the potential to increase water productivity,\" one of the report's authors said. </p> <p>Another option considered is that of farmers using more urban waste water for irrigation. It is estimated that up to 10% of the world's population now eat food produced using waste water from towns and cities. Cities are predicted to use 150% more water within 20 years, which will be both a problem and an opportunity. \"This means more waste water but also less fresh water available for agriculture. In the future, using waste water may not be a choice but a necessity,\" the report says. </p> <p>The authors say that western governments need to change their policies: \"Agricultural subsidies keep world commodity prices low in poor countries and discourage farmers from investing [in water-saving technologies] because they will not get a return on their investments. Land and water rights are also needed so people will invest in long-term improvements.\"</p>",

  "\"Every step you take, I'll be watching you,\" sang the pop trio, The Police, in 1983. Now the real law enforcement agency is using satellite technology to do just that. <p>Officers will keep tabs on paedophiles, domestic abusers and other prolific criminals 24 hours a day, thanks to an innovative tracking scheme launched in three pilot areas in England yesterday. </p> <p>A total of 120 offenders, 40 each in Greater Manchester, Hampshire, and the West Midlands, will be fitted with devices that can pinpoint their position to within two metres. </p> <p>An alert will go off if the offender, given the device as a condition of prison release or alternative to jail, breaches restrictions - for instance, if a child abuser goes near a school playground, if someone with a history of domestic violence approaches a victim's home, or a burglar is out on the prowl. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, unveiled the scheme in Manchester, describing it as a \"prison without bars\" that he hoped would cut crime and give the police and probation service a tool with which to protect the public. </p> <p>Devices will be linked to a satellite global positioning system (GPS), backed up in some cases by mobile phone. A step beyond electronic tagging, the device can tell its monitor where an offender is at any given time, displaying their location to within two metres on an Ordnance Survey map. </p> <p>Electronic tags register whether the wearer leaves a designated area - say, breaks a curfew - but cannot show where he or she has gone. </p> <p>GPS has been used to monitor offenders in several US states but this is its first use in Europe. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has set a target of cutting crime by 15% by 2008. He said: \"The government is determined to be at the cutting edge of technology in the drive to make our communities safer and ensure more effective sentencing of offenders. </p> <p>\"Our sentencing reforms were not just about being tougher on the most serious offenders. This technology will allow us to develop and promote the tough community sentences, which are vital if we are to prevent reoffending and give non-violent offenders a chance to serve an effective sentence in the community.\" </p> <p>The year-long trial costs an average \u00a368 a day per offender. If successful, it will cover up to 5,000 prolific offenders at large in England and Wales, and could even be used in open prisons. </p> <p>Domestic abusers, and prolific offenders such as car thieves, robbers and burglars, and some juveniles, will be among those fitted with the devices; only Manchester will monitor paedophiles. </p> <p>West Midlands and Hampshire will use passive tracking, which records locations retrospectively, downloading data at certain times of day. Manchester will also use hybrid tracking - monitoring offenders in real time to enable police to act quickly if they enter an exclusion zone. </p> <p>Police and probation services were enthusiastic about satellite tracking, which they hope will add an extra layer of intelligence as well as deterring persistent reoffenders and making it easier to protect potential victims. </p> <p>Liam Bradshaw, the assistant chief constable for Essex and a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: \"All forces are aware of some individuals whose offending levels can inflict misery on local communities. </p> <p>\"Having greater levels of information and intelligence about the movements and behaviour of these individuals will be beneficial in preventing and solving crime and protecting the public.\" </p> <p>Robert Mathers, the chief probation officer for Manchester, said: \"Satellite tracking looks to be a promising tool, particularly in the protection of victims of domestic violence and sex offences.\" </p> <p>Others who work with prisoners and ex-prisoners warned the scheme should not be seen as a catch-all solution. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: \"This will prove a very expensive resource and therefore must be limited to those offenders that pose the highest risk of harm to the public. </p> <p>\"Satellite tracking is another form of control which, by itself, will not prevent crime. It must be seen as part of a package. It's also critical that it's not used as a substitute for treatment, supervision and surveillance.\" </p> <p>Mark Leech, the founder of the national ex-offenders' charity, Unlock, and editor of Prisons Handbook, said: \"I wish the Home Office would focus more on resettlement needs that actually prevent crime, such as ensuring discharged prisoners have access to housing, employment and financial assistance, rather than gathering evidence and intelligence by tracking which only comes into play once the victim has already suffered.\"</p>",
  "<p>House prices in Britain fell 0.6% in August, said the Halifax bank today, in the latest sign that the property market has come off the boil.</p> <p>It was the first time since December 2002 that Halifax had reported a fall in house prices. Britain's biggest mortgage lender said the rise in interest rates was now acting as a brake on house price growth, a view with which industry analysts concurred. </p> <p>The Bank of England has increased borrowing costs, from their historic lows of 3.5%, five times since November. Interest rates now stand at 4.75% and analysts expect little, if any, further increase.</p> <p>\"With consumer spending also showing signs of moderating in July and August, there is a growing possibility that the Bank of England could leave interest rates unchanged through the rest of this year,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>The pound hit a three-month low against the dollar amid expectations that UK interest rates might not need to rise much more. </p> <p>\"House prices have increased by 1.8% during the past three months. This is significantly below the 6.5% rise recorded in the preceding three months, providing further evidence that the housing market is slowing in response to the recent series of interest rate increases,\" said Martin Ellis, chief economist at Halifax.</p> <p>The latest figures are in line with those reported by Nationwide Building Society earlier this week, which showed house price growth had stalled to 0.1% in August, down from a jump of 2.1% in July. </p> <p>They are also consistent with survey evidence from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which has shown a weakening in both price growth and demand, while the property website Rightmove recently said average asking prices had fallen by more than \u00a31,200 during the last two weeks of August. </p> <p>But Halifax stressed that monthly price falls were part of the normal fluctuations of the market, adding that this was the 10th monthly drop during the past five years, a period in which house prices have more than doubled. </p> <p>Playing down fears of a crash in house prices, Halifax said the market continued to be supported by a strong economy.</p> <p>\"The market remains well underpinned by a strong economic background, historically low debt-servicing costs and supply shortages,\" Mr Ellis said. \"We continue to expect house price inflation to slow gradually over the remainder of 2004 and into next year as higher interest rates and increasing difficulties faced by potential first-time buyers in entering the market curb housing demand.\" </p> <p>Today's data virtually rule out the likelihood of a rise in interest rates when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets next week. </p> <p>The MPC has already signalled that interest rates are approaching their peak. If it has managed to cool the property market through its \"gradualist\" policy of interest rate rises, the Bank will have accomplished the rare feat of slowly deflating the bubble in asset prices.</p>",
  "British Nuclear Fuels is to be allowed to continue releasing a radioactive gas blamed for 100 cancers a year - even though it was first ordered to prevent the pollution 27 years ago. <p>After a decade of trying to enforce the planning condition, the Environment Agency has admitted that by the time BNFL could build a facility to control the Krypton 85 gas, the \u00a31.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant which produces it is likely to have shut. </p> <p>The condition was first imposed in 1977 by Mr Justice Parker when he gave permission for the Thorp plant, as he was concerned about the public health implications of releasing the gas. </p> <p>But when the plant opened in 1994 there was no Krypton 85-trapping equipment and up to 500 cubic metres of the gas have been released daily into the atmosphere at Sellafield ever since. </p> <p>Although the gas is widely dispersed by the wind, government advisers have estimated it causes up to 100 extra cancers a year, two of them fatal. </p> <p>Krypton 85 is one of a number of radioactive byproducts released when spent nuclear fuel is dissolved in acid in order to recover plutonium and uranium. </p> <p>For 10 years BNFL has been locked in a dispute with the Environment Agency over the technical and financial feasibility of capturing the gas on a large scale. </p> <p>While the company admitted it had failed to adhere to the planning condition, it insisted this was because the technology was not available to capture such a large volume of gas. </p> <p>But the agency did not accept this explanation, and instructed the company to develop the technology. </p> <p>Since then, BNFL has repeatedly failed to come up with what it considers to be a safe and reliable method of capturing the gas and the agency has repeatedly refused to accept that the company has done enough to tackle the problem. Some reprocessing plants in other countries have Krypton-capturing equipment, but on a small scale. </p> <p>BNFL said it would cost \u00a3300m to develop the technology to allow large-scale capturing, which would require freezing the gas to extract it. </p> <p>To make it safe, it would then have to be stored under pressure in bottles for 100 years until the radioactivity disappeared. </p> <p>The agency was not convinced by BNFL's argument and appointed independent consultants to investigate. </p> <p>They said it would cost \u00a375m for a capturing plant, and suggested that BNFL could make money from the process by capturing a second and valuable gas called xenon, which is used in car headlights and double glazing. They estimated that sales of xenon could raise \u00a350m a year. </p> <p>The argument has gone on for so long that a lack of new orders for Thorp means that the flagship plant will probably close by 2010, or possibly sooner, although the agency is still operating to a date of 2016. </p> <p>Last night, a spokesman for BNFL accepted that it was possible to capture Krypton, but said it was extremely difficult on the scale required at Sellafield. </p> <p>He said that, apart from the problem of capturing the gas, it was potentially dangerous to workers to store it under pressure for prolonged periods. </p> <p>In its decision document, which comes into force in October, the agency told the company to reconsider the issue, particularly to discover whether the expanding market for xenon would pay for the recovery of Krypton. </p> <p>It has given BNFL another six months to come up with an answer.</p>",
  "Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I am honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the United States. <p>When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud.</p> <p>Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them. Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness in our future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and I am honored to have him at my side.</p> <p>I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First Lady.</p> <p>I am a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women. I am blessed with a sister and brothers who are also my closest friends. And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.</p> <p>My father served eight years at the side of another great American, Ronald Reagan. His spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and in our hearts, and will always define our party.</p> <p>Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contest for the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next four years.</p> <p>I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed the most important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are making sustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because we acted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.</p> <p>I am running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win this election.</p> <p>The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom.</p> <p>The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that provided health care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home.</p> <p>This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take your side. Many of our most fundamental systems - the tax code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training - were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared and thus truly free to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams.</p> <p>My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition for our workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to do business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending, reducing regulation, and making tax relief permanent. To create jobs, we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe. And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across America.</p> <p>Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork and headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code.</p> <p>Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better, higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for community colleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the world.</p> <p>In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and other jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we'll provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America.</p> <p>As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have told me they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured are small-business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts, and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs. And we will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center.</p> <p>As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially OB-GYNS, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.</p> <p>In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.</p> <p>Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings security, and dignity, and independence.</p> <p>Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to my home.</p> <p>In an ownership society, more people will own their health plans, and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We will always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account - a nest egg you can call your own, and government can never take away.</p> <p>In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life.</p> <p>This path begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the path to the promise of America.</p> <p>We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help and we're providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor and this year 90 percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: \"We don't focus on what we can't do at this school; we focus on what we can do; we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line.\" This principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is the spirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningun ni\u00f1o atras. We will leave no child behind.</p> <p>We are making progress and there is more to do. In this time of change, most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one in four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, and expanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma.</p> <p>America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.</p> <p>Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com.</p> <p>These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face a choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute them. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, and opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them. To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for: he's proposed more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. To pay for that spending, he is running on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps.</p> <p>His policies of tax and spend - of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity - are the policies of the past. We are on the path to the future and we are not turning back.</p> <p>In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.</p> <p>Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminate against them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law.</p> <p>My opponent recently announced that he is the candidate of \"conservative values,\" which must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. Now, there are some problems with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight years of \"moral darkness,\" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them.</p> <p>This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism and you know where I stand. Three days after September 11th, I stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, \"Whatever it takes.\" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Do not let me down.\" Since that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America whatever it takes.</p> <p>So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained half a million first responders, because we are determined to protect our homeland. We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services. We are staying on the offensive striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail.</p> <p>Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida, Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups, Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising, Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons, Iraq was a gathering threat, and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks. Today, the government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror, Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders, Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests, Libya is dismantling its weapons programs, the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom, and more than three-quarters of al-Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led, many have joined, and America and the world are safer.</p> <p>This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. And the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. And we know that September 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and we will, confront threats to America before it is too late.</p> <p>In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences. Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office - a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget the lessons of September 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.</p> <p>Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October presidential election - a resounding endorsement of democracy. Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are scheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies, and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned.</p> <p>Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: \"We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,\" he continued, \"are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is a test of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories in confronting the evil terrorists.\"</p> <p>That young man is right - our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America. Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and making America safer. Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just and will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory.</p> <p>Again, my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress overwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets, and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, \"I actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it.\" Then he said he was \"proud\" of that vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a \"complicated\" matter. There is nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat.</p> <p>Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. And I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, and President Kwasniewski, and Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course, Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p> <p>Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called America's allies, quote, a \"coalition of the coerced and the bribed.\" That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician. I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history. America is grateful, and America will not forget.</p> <p>The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office. They had \"X\"s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been cut off, by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes. During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth.</p> <p>Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope, and purpose, and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear and they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march.</p> <p>I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel. Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers, and political prisoners, and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advances heart by heart, and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more peaceful.</p> <p>America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist wrote in the New York Times, \"Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. [European] capitals are frightened. In every [military] headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.\" End quote. Maybe that same person's still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolute president named Truman, who with the American people persevered, knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today.</p> <p>The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics and that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world.</p> <p>This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment, and used it to build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of our Nation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me.</p> <p>In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called \"walking.\" Now and then I come across as a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there.</p> <p>One thing I have learned about the presidency is that, whatever shortcomings you have, people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're going to need them. These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I have tried to comfort Americans who lost the most on September 11th - people who showed me a picture or told me a story, so I would know how much was taken from them. I have learned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is right. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead, who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who are told their dad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their dad or mom.</p> <p>And I have met with parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I am in their prayers to offer encouragement to me. Where does strength like that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of a great nation: decent, and idealistic, and strong.</p> <p>The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced peril together, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say: Here buildings fell, and here a nation rose.</p> <p>We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with their effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested and confident Nation can achieve anything.</p> <p>To everything we know there is a season - a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a safer world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed. Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future of the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS</b>: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1296602,00.html\">George Bush last night laid out his case for another term in the White House, claiming only he would keep America safe from a \"drift towards tragedy\" in a world scarred by terrorism</a>.</p> <p><b>SCHOOL SIEGE WEARS ON</b></p> <p>All the papers lead with a picture of a burly Russian special forces officer carrying a young baby to safety from the North Ossetia school where terrorists are holding hundreds of children and adults hostage.</p> <p>The terrorists released 31 women and young children yesterday, but despite the siege entering its third day, they have still refused to accept food and water for the captives. The children have been drinking tap and toilet water, but food had run out, the Telegraph reported. </p> <p>Russian officials say that about 320 hostages remain inside, but the Guardian cites a woman released yesterday who claimed the true figure was 1,020. </p> <p>Anguished relatives fear Russian forces will launch an assault on the school. </p> <p>The Guardian fears that the pro-Russian, Christian Orthodox, well-armed region of North Ossetia will exact its own revenge on its Muslim neighbours in Ingushetia and Chechnya without waiting for Moscow. \"The delicate patchwork of multi-ethnic statelets on Russia's sensitive southern flank could rapidly unravel,\" a leader says. </p> <p>The Times contrasts the horror unfolding in the Russian town of Beslan with the high hopes in France that two journalists held in Iraq will be set free today. Early reports indicated that they may have been handed over to a Sunni opposition group, despite France's refusal to capitulate to the demand that it reverse a law banning headscarves (and other religious symbols) in schools. </p> <p>French Muslims, however, proved themselves unwilling to be dictated to by foreign terrorists, and backed the government even while they disagreed with the headscarf ban. \"The kidnappers had unwittingly succeeded in forging an unprecedented sense of national solidarity in France,\" the Times quotes the French education minister as saying. </p> <p>Several of the papers feature a photograph of a French Muslim schoolgirl experimenting with a wig in place of a headscarf. She looks distinctly uncomfortable with the compromise. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1296517,00.html\">Amid the savagery of the siege, an act of humanity</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1296289,00.html\">A terrible lesson from a classroom in Beslan</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/wosse103.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/03/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Distressed parents can only hope</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1244339,00.html\">Times: Journalists held in Iraq to be set free</a></p> <p><b>BUSH: PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES WILL CONTINUE</b></p> <p>Do you remember compassionate conservatism? Well, it's back, and now it has a global agenda. </p> <p>The US, apparently, is going to become \"liberty central\". Thus spake George Bush just before delivering his speech yesterday to the Republican national convention. He went on to tell the assembled minions in New York that he would continue to pursue the \"Bush doctrine\" of striking pre-emptively at enemies before they could strike the US. </p> <p>\"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that the government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives,\" he said. The Wrap hopes for the sake of all those foreigners about to be affected that the international flavour of compassionate conservatism includes job creation, health care and the eradication of poverty, items noticeably absent from the domestic agenda.</p> <p>The Independent pretty much ignores Bush's speech, instead devoting five pages, including the front, to a list of numbers compiled by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter. It's designed to prove (cuz numbers are scientific, see?) that Mr Bush has been a horrid failure as president. If you can be bothered to read this interminable list (\"46: percentage increase in sales between 2001 and 2002 of GI Joe figures\"), you will stumble across some gems. (USD10.6m: average wealth of the members of Bush's original 16-person cabinet.) </p> <p>Meanwhile the Telegraph reports that the \"mother of the hanging chad\" - the Palm Beach Country, Florida, election official responsible for selecting the disastrous punchcard ballot for the 2000 presidential election - has been voted out of office. Theresa LePore will, however, still preside over the November election. Surely if they just fling a load of ballots at Hurricane Frances, the result will be every bit as accurate a reflection of the voters' will. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1296500,00.html\">Bush: war on terror will not cease</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=557746\">Independent: Bush by numbers: Four years of double standards</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/wus303.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/03/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Mother of the hanging chad deposed</a></p> <p><b>WANT FRIES WITH THAT?</b></p> <p>For all those tired of hearing about how flabby Britain has become, the Sun has discovered a kebab shop in Glasgow that produces the antidote: the Stonner Kebab.

Today, the Telegraph travels to Bournemouth promenade, where the local council is doing battle with kamikaze cyclists. The council has set up a speed trap - aka someone in a fluorescent top pointing a handheld radar gun at passing cyclists - to stop commuters whizzing past at more than 10mph and endangering pedestrians. Drivers would be jealous of the usual penalty: a sharp word and a leaflet on safe cycling.</p> <p>Over in Wolverhampton, the council would love a few speedy cyclists. They have set up a GBP60,000 scheme to tempt commuters out of their cars by offering free cycling lessons. Wolverhampton's residents, however, were quick to point out to the Telegraph that they already knew how to cycle, they simply did not want to. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/nbike03.xml\">Telegraph: Cyclists saddled with seafront speed trap</a></p> <p><b>BUTCH BOLOGNESE</b></p> <p>Actor Paul Newman, clad in a red nose, face paint and outsize bow tie, makes it into all the papers under the pseudonym Butch Bolognese.

  "<p>CBI director-general Digby Jones last night set the employers' organisation on a collision course with the unions after accusing them of becoming increasingly irrelevant and failing to respond to the challenges of the global economy. </p> <p>Union leaders were competing to show who could be the most militant in an attempt to boost membership levels at a time when fewer employees needed union representation, he said in a speech to business leaders in Scotland. </p> <p>\"The only protection people need in a tight labour market with skills shortages is to be so adaptable, trained and valuable that no employer would dare let them go or treat them badly,\" he told CBI Scotland's annual dinner. </p> <p>Union leaders responded angrily to his attack. The TUC said it regretted Mr Jones's return to the rhetoric of the Thatcher years, while Transport and General Workers Union general secretary Tony Woodley urged the CBI director-general to \"come and join the real world\". </p> <p>In his speech Mr Jones pointed to a decline in union membership - especially in the private sector - and claimed that too many trade union leaders had \"outdated notions of the world of work\". They were seeking to bring back measures such as secondary picketing which had helped to make Britain \"the sick man of Europe\". </p> <p>With unions representing fewer than one in five workers in the private sector, organised labour was \"increasingly irrelevant every day\" while employees were \"perplexed\" by the \"apparent competition for the title of most militant\". </p> <p>Mr Jones argued that the unions \"never learn\". \"They just don't get it. They are doing no more than marching valiantly towards 1970.\" </p> <p>Unless the unions reformed and became more flexible, \"the very people they are paid to protect are the people who will suffer most\". </p> <p>Britain, he said, had Europe's most flexible labour market, was the top European destination for inward investment, had a higher level of output per capita than France, Germany and Italy, as well as boasting the lowest unemployment of leading nations in the developed world. </p> <p>\"This is not a collection of happy coincidences,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The unions face stark choice. Either recognise the competitive demands of the 21st century, reform, put training as your top priority for employees - and, by encouraging flexibility - help the nation with the battle for competitiveness. Or wither on the vine of growing irrelevancy.\" </p> <p>In response, Mr Woodley said if unions were irrelevant \"I doubt the director [sic] of the CBI would be devoting half his speech to attacking us\". </p> <p>\"Digby Jones ought to come and join the real world, where we are all working harder for longer. Modern workers need union representation more than ever, and any worker in Britain can tell you they face a stack of workplace issues.\" </p> <p>He said Mr Jones could not grasp that the unions wanted a stronger economy with better opportunities for workers, which was why unions had initiated training schemes in thousands of workplaces. </p> <p>\"The CBI should concentrate on building British industry rather than attacking an integral part of it.\" </p> <p>A TUC spokesman said: \"It's disappointing to see Digby Jones go back to the rhetoric of the Thatcher years. </p> <p>\"That is not the way business will be taken seriously. Without unions to stand up for people at work, Britain would be a much less fair society, pensions would be on their way out - except in the boardroom - and many more people would be injured or die at work every year.\"</p>",

  "<p>A string of private equity groups are running the rule over Big Brother producer Endemol in anticipation of its owner, Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, firing the starting gun on a \u00a31bn-plus auction process. </p> <p>Venture capital groups including 3i, Apax, Candover and Cinven are believed to be looking seriously at bidding for Endemol, the independent production giant that has operations in 21 countries and makes shows including Big Brother, Fame Academy and Restoration. </p> <p>Telefonica bought the company for \u00a33.5bn in 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom, when the convergence of delivery and content was all the rage.</p> <p>But it has since indicated that it does not see it as a core operation and would be willing to sell it on or float it. </p> <p>Apax, 3i, Candover and Cinven all have money to invest as confidence begins to return to the market. Apax looked at the possibility of buying ITV companies Carlton and Granada before they were merged, and all four were involved in the auction for the Telegraph Group, which was eventually sold to private buyers, the Barclay brothers, for \u00a3690m. </p> <p>3i was closest to triumphing in the race for the Telegraph titles after its bid, headed by former Trinity Mirror chief David Montgomery, made it to the final three bidders. But ultimately, it couldn't match the premium paid by the Barclays. </p> <p>However, all of the potentially interested parties - which could also include US private equity groups and broadcasters - are waiting for Telefonica officially to put Endemol up for sale, a move they expect to happen within the next year. </p> <p>Sources in the private equity fraternity believe that Telefonica will conduct a formal auction process in an effort to realise as much value as possible, rather than agreeing to a straight management buyout or IPO. </p> <p>Along with RTL-owned Fremantle, Endemol is one of very few truly global independent producers able to sell its own formats across multiple territories and leverage the interactive and merchandising rights that are expected to become more important as the industry evolves. \"It's got critical mass and a global presence,\" said one City source. </p> <p>For that reason, private equity buyers would prefer to buy the company as a whole rather than seeing it broken up into its constituent parts. </p> <p>While they would consider a management buyout, a prospect raised recently by Endemol's UK chief executive, Peter Bazalgette, they would prefer a straight cash deal rather than dealing with the \"egos and complications\" involved in handing the company over to management. </p> <p>He confirmed that senior managers in Endemol's key markets - including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK and the US - were looking at their options for jointly buying the business.

City analysts have questioned the strategic rationale of a deal that will add to the group's North American assets when it previously expressed a desire to diversify globally. </p> <p>WPP is also expected to express a preliminary interest in the Moving Picture Company, the special effects business owned by broadcaster ITV. </p> <p>PwC, which is advising ITV on the possible sale, is understood to have sent a memorandum of understanding to about 20 interested parties, including WPP. </p> <p>Tangent, the investment vehicle run by Michael Green, also received the financial details and has begun looking at due diligence.

  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is facing a backlash by Australian investors against the company's planned move to the US state of Delaware. </p> <p>Concern about the reincorporation - and News Corp's accompanying departure from Australia's leading S&amp;P/ASX 200 index - is running so high that some senior analysts are suggesting the move could be voted down at the firm's annual meeting in Adelaide this October. </p> <p>Several funds have begun looking at setting up an alternative index that would replace the ASX 200 and allow News Corp to retain its presence in Australian rankings, though such a move would not come to fruition soon enough to prevent a vote against the move in October. </p> <p>The chain of events set in motion by Murdoch's relisting announcement in April is forcing Australia's investors to choose between the country's biggest listed company and its benchmark equities index. It is a sign of News Corp's importance to Australia that big funds are seriously considering jettisoning Standard &amp; Poor's ASX 200 if another provider can find room for the company on a rival Australian index. </p> <p>\"News Corp is one of the reasons people invest in Australia,\" said a media analyst at one of the country's top three investment funds. \"People want it in their investable universe...If it doesn't [stay on Australian indices] Australia will be the poorer for it.\" </p> <p>Encouraged by the anxiety among Australian institutions, on Wednesday UBS announced that it would make a decision by the end of the year about setting up such an index. When Rupert Murdoch announced the move to the US in April he proposed a dual-listed structure whereby News Corp would retain its presence on the ASX 200 while appearing on America's benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. </p> <p>Standard &amp; Poor's index committee immediately expressed concerns that the structure would lead to News Corp being double-counted in its Global 1200 index, and in June it ruled that the firm would have to be removed from the ASX 200 if the US move went ahead. </p> <p>The effect on News Corp's value has been serious. Ordinary shares in Sydney gained more than a dollar after Murdoch's initial relisting announcement, but since S&amp;P ruled out dual-indexing in June prices have sunk from A$13.11 to below A$11, a drop of 16%, equivalent to \u00a34.7bn. In Britain, BSkyB's share price has seen a similar decline. </p> <p>Australian investors have long feared the prospect of becoming a \"branch office economy\" - distant from company headquarters and vulnerable to cutbacks and downsizing - and the News Corp relisting appears to play to many of those fears. </p> <p>As Australian funds see it, local investors are losing their usual enthusiasm for News stock. If the move to the US goes ahead, the Australian stock will be sold off over nine months in four 25% tranches. </p> <p>Several institutions fear that this forced transfer will prevent them getting full value for their shares, and the logic of the market means that the worries of the most wary investors are rapidly turning into reality for everybody. With the more cautious fund managers shying away from News Corp stock, the resulting decline in price has started causing even the most bullish investors to have second thoughts. \"The longer the stock underperforms, the more likely it will be that we get a no vote,\" said one analyst. </p> <p>News Corp's presence in the ASX is so predominant that the decision will have widespread repercussions on the makeup of the Australian market and the funds of local stockholders. </p> <p>Most Australian funds have 5-10% of their cash invested in News Corp, and the company makes up about 7% of the ASX 200 index - down from 9% before S&amp;P forbade the dual-indexing. Without News the ASX could be dangerously concentrated, with more than half of its value invested in banking and property. </p> <p>Much of the public debate over the move has been led by AMP, Australia's second-biggest investment fund. Last month it carried out a straw poll of main funds to lobby Standard &amp; Poor's to set up an alternative fund that would include News Corp, but chief investment officer Merv Peacock admits that the indexer will be hard to budge. </p> <p>Murdoch needs to get a 75% vote in favour of the move at News Corp's meeting in October, intended to be the last in the company's home city. That is not such a hard call as it seems, because 30% of the voting stock is owned by Murdoch's family firm, Cruden Investments, and a further 9% iby his friend John Malone at Liberty Media. </p> <p>That means that at least 40% of ordinary shareholders must vote against the move to stop it going ahead. Given that more than half of the voting stock is owned by nominee companies which are less likely to be worried about the long-term state of the Australian market, Murdoch's position still looks good. </p> <p>But there are attractions to a no vote. Many investors are concerned about the way News Corp's articles of incorporation in Delaware will entrench the power of the board and restrict that of shareholders. Others have been quick to notice that a vote against the move will be the easiest way to ensure a rise in value. The jitters clearly have been enough to spook Murdoch, who spent a week romancing the big fund managers in Australia last month. </p> <p>\"The impact is that we will have to think carefully about how we vote,\" says Merv Peacock. \"In very simplistic terms, a yes vote to the move effectively drives down the investment, while a no vote means the share price will go back up. That's fairly simple logic that says it might be in the best long-term interests to vote against.\"</p>",
  "Peter Lampl is right to question the wisdom of pumping so much government money into new city academies. But his alternative is dangerous, divisive and damaging to the future of quality state education (Huge sums being wasted, August 31). <p>Lampl's premise is that our best schools are those in the independent sector. What sort of achievement is it to admit only young people from the top 10% of the ability range and then turn them out at the age of 18 still in that 10%? High-achieving comprehensives match this performance with their high-flyers, while also producing top-quality results and university placements for pupils whom the private sector wouldn't even consider at the age of 11. </p> <p>Using government money to fund places at independent schools for the brightest inner-city pupils would rob state schools of their most able pupils, thus widening the league-table gap between state and private schools. The result of such a policy would be a two-tier system of private schools for the academically able and state secondary moderns for the rest. The alternative is to banish the counsels of despair and invest properly in our state schools, ensuring standards continue to rise. This is the real challenge.<br> <b>David Nichols</b><br> Headteacher, Littleover Community School, Derby </p> <p>It is disingenuous to suggest that subsidising the independent sector offers a long-term model for raising national standards or saving the children of poor families from underachievement. </p> <p>Independent schools succeed because they have the resources, the legal right and the ethos to change the learning environment, chiefly by excluding the students most likely to affect their grade results. In the state sector, responsible for the education of all students, not just the gifted minority represented by the independent sector, this practice is both impossible and undesirable. Perhaps by redirecting a little more of his largesse to underfunded state schools, Peter Lampl would encourage the government to realise that therein lies the problem of underachievement (and the successes of private education) and follow suit with the massive resources that only the state can provide.<br> <b>Thomas Kiely</b><br> Oxford </p> <p>Peter Lampl cites Belvedere School for Girls as an example of the best of the independent schools. But Belvedere came 235th in a recently published league table of A-level results; 49 state schools performed better, including three non-selective comprehensives. According to the Department for Education's GCSE tables in 2003, Belvedere, which selects on ability, had 7% of its 15-year-old pupils achieving no GCSE passes. </p> <p>My local comprehensive had only 1% achieving no GCSE passes. Schools like ours provide a first-class academic education, excel at music and sport and are a focal point for the local community, and a cohesive factor within it.<br> <b>Tony Rea</b><br> Ivybridge, Devon </p> <p>So what's new (11-Plus favours wealthy children, September 1)?

  "<p>The founder and chairman of sofa chain DFS last night slapped down an extra \u00a311m in his effort to buy back the firm, increasing his controversial bid by 10p a share. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham, who had been staring at defeat in his plan to regain control of the company he started more than 30 years ago, is now offering \u00a3507m for the 67-store chain. The new price is \u00a345m more than his initial bid of 415p a share. </p> <p>The increased offer was made just before a deadline for investors to accept Lord Kirkham's terms. It also comes just a few days after the company's three non-executive directors, led by former Halifax boss Mike Blackburn, said they might resign if shareholders failed to follow their recommendation and accept the chairman's offer. Last night they recommended the new terms. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham is attempting to take control using a scheme of arrangement - which is quicker and cheaper than a traditional takeover but requires 75% approval from shareholders. </p> <p>The chairman had given warning that the outlook for DFS as a quoted company was poor and urged shareholders to sell out. To exert additional pressure Lord Kirkham, who is seen as the linchpin of the business, has refused to commit to staying with DFS after he turns 60 later this year. </p> <p>Nevertheless, investors led by Morley Fund Management and M&amp;G, which together own some 15% of DFS, had made clear that they were unimpressed with the offer price and were ready to rebuff the chairman and watch the non-executives quit. Mr Blackburn met hedge fund managers in London on Wednesday to urge them to accept the bid but he failed to gain support. </p> <p>Last night Lord Kirkham said his new bid was final but he had not been trying to get the company on the cheap with his initial offer. \"This offer will not be increased in any circumstances,\" he said, adding: \"It remains my view that the original terms of the offer were fair to shareholders.\" </p> <p>His new offer is 455p cash plus an entitlement to a share in up to \u00a357.5m of rebates the company might win from Customs and Excise. Shareholders will vote on September 23. </p> <p>The shares closed up 3.7% at 441p, indicating that final victory for Lord Kirkham is still far from certain. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Retail tycoon Philip Green yesterday dismissed suggestions that he is planning to make an offer for J Sainsbury as shares in the ailing supermarket chain leapt on renewed bid speculation. </p> <p>\"It's absolute rubbish,\" Mr Green said. \"I've been back in the UK for 48 hours and I haven't talked to anyone.\" </p> <p>Sainsbury's shares rose 13p to close at 271p. </p> <p>The retail billionaire, bruised by his failed attempt to take over Marks&amp;Spencer, is seen by many as being in need of a big deal to provide extra space for his best fashion labels - and just to show that he can do so. </p> <p>Mr Green last winter approached Sir Peter Davis, then chief executive of Sainsbury's, with a \u00a36.4bn bid proposal, but was swiftly shown the door. Any takeover would require the approval of the Sainsbury family, which still controls 34% of the business. </p> <p>An alternative potential bidder is cash-rich US retailer Target, which is said to have dispatched senior executives to Britain to search for acquisitions. A Target spokeswoman refused to comment on Sainsbury's but said there was still potential in the US. </p> <p>The rumours came as Sainsbury's new chief executive, Justin King, appointed former Safeway director Lawrence Christensen to sort out supply chain problems. Sainsbury's has invested millions in new depots but technology problems have left shelves empty.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> It may only be September, ladies and gentlemen, but we think we have our Corporate Environmentalists of the Year. A big hand, then, for waste management company Sita, which has a \u00a32.3m per year contract with Northumberland county council to recycle local rubbish. The refuse should be sorted for recycling at Sita's Wallsend plant, but - and you really have to admire the ethos - the company recently decided it might be cheaper to export it to India. Alas, only 200 tonnes of rubbish were shipped before the council discovered what was afoot and put a furious stop to it, but we call Nicola Dowlen at Sita HQ with our warmest congratulations. Presumably they Fed-Exed the stuff to India? \"It was containerised and sent out,\" she says. \"On a cargo ship.\" Yes. Sorry to press the point Nicola, but did you at any point pan out to the bigger picture and think, dear God, this idea is beyond retarded? \"It was an experiment,\" she claims. \"We're always looking at new recycling options.\" Great - mind if we pitch to you? \"Er... OK.\" How about building a paper-recycling machine that literally runs on rainforest tree trunks? A pause. \"Whatever new technology comes out, we'll look at,\" says Nicola firmly. In the meantime, we learn the Environment Agency is investigating whether international law has been broken. Splendid work. <p><b>\u00b7</b> We are appalled by a sudden flurry of rumours suggesting Barbara Amiel has separated from Conrad Black. This seems bizarre, as Barbara has always struck us as the least fair weather of consorts, a woman who would be equally at home filing that expense claim for tipping a New York department store doorman as she would visiting Sing Sing with this month's supply of gentleman's magazines. Although a spokesman for the Blacks is too grand to comment, we are given to understand the allegation is complete cobblers. So let's hear no more about it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It's to one of Conrad's former publications we turn next, though, as a Spectator small ad tempts us with a Cape Town property. The house is located in the city's Constantia district, and is offered with a swimming pool for either long or short lease. Interested applicants may be wise to establish there are no hidden hitches - hefty deposits, say, or a housebound landlord. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In Hartlepool, meanwhile, Mandy Mandelson insists on charming his constituents to the bitter end. Learning that one of their number, John Bloom, is to stand as a Respect candidate after two decades of Labour campaigning, Mandy uses his Hartlepool Mail column to attack George Galloway, concluding with the taunt: \"Is this the sort of company you want to keep, John?\" John, however, is not convinced he has the ghastlier associates, and submits a rather dignified letter explaining this. Still, good to see New Labour so relaxed, and we look forward to the byelection with interest. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Less enlivening is the prospect of the next extract from Diary Book Club recommendation, The Pet Goat, the book that so entranced George Bush that he kept reading it for a full five minutes after he had been informed two planes had hit the World Trade Centre. Sadly - and it may just be the end of the week talking - we find it too stupefyingly dull to even continue transcribing.
