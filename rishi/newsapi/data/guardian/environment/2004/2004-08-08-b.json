  "Walking around the peripheral areas of European cities, or observing the infills in city centres, can provide an idea of the results of modern urbanism. Not particularly brilliant (Riba goes to town, July 31; Letters, August 5-7). <p>When architecture (and housing) just attends to ephemeral fashion, as a mere object of consumption, it gets injected with a fast obsolescence, both physical and visual. It condemns millions of people to a perpetually changing environment of shorter and shorter time span. Is this a sustainable approach? </p> <p>Those responsible for remaking our cities should think first of all about where they have chosen to live. We would be surprised about the gap in the personal choice of these people and what they so loudly defend for others. </p> <p>No, New Urbanism is not something petrified. If we are looking for a sustainable development, it is the answer.<br> <b>Prof Javier Cenicacelaya</b><br> Bilbao, Spain </p> <p>The massed ranks of the design professionals are right to call for a revival of interest in urban studies. But the understanding demonstrated by these bodies is partial and dominated by physical design. An alternative is the urban studies known to social scientists for 150 years that engages with the social and technical production of the built environment and an understanding of the social and economic life of which the buildings are but a part. </p> <p>Design professionals hold a powerful position in our society; urban social scientists a lesser one. What is sadly lacking is a balanced and critical dialogue between them. Success in this will produce professionals who can fashion urban environments that work with and for, rather than dictate to, people in a full social context.<br> <b>Dr Andy Pratt</b><br> Director, MSc in cities, space and society, LSE </p> <p>I am impressed by the approach of Europe's medium-sized cities, such as Montpellier, as well many of England's northern cities. A key feature has been a willingness to address transport as a social issue rather than a planning problem. Gains are also visible in cities that have promoted inclusion and culture as vehicles for wider economic and social regeneration.<br> <b>Dave Shields</b><br> Southampton </p>",
  "While the world focuses on the war against terror, the war against poverty slides on to the backburner. Since the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 2001, three developments have become decisive on a global scale. The first is the fight to root out militants, the second is the political rise of those on the religious margins and the third is the growing gap between the rich and the poor. <p>Pakistan is a frontline state in the war against terrorism. Most of the leading terrorists have been arrested in Pakistan. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, once described as the CEO of al-Qaida, was arrested in Rawalpindi. Other important leaders continue to be caught in dribs and drabs every six months, including Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian, who was arrested in the Pakistani city of Gujrat last month. </p> <p>This is good and bad news for Islamabad's military ruler. The positive part is that General Pervez Musharraf gets to play good cop and earn Washington's pleasure to continue his dictatorship. The bad part is that eyebrows are raised as to why leading al-Qaida militants found it necessary to hide in a land run by Washington's \"key ally\" in the war against terror. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Pakistan, assassinations and suicide bombings have also been increasing domestically. Scores of Pakistanis and many foreigners have been killed. Many political leaders have been gunned down in the streets - from Rawalpindi in the north to Karachi in the south. </p> <p>None of the assassins has been arrested. Instead, public attention has been focused on five apparent assassination attempts against high-profile targets that have taken place since last December: two attacks on Gen Musharraf, and one each on the Karachi corps commander, the prime minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz, and the Baluchistan chief minister. </p> <p>While the regime insists these were genuine assassination attempts, their pattern suggests something different. At most, they seem to have been attempts to frighten the targets. At worst, if the cynics are to be believed, the attacks were stage-managed for external consumption. </p> <p>For example, in each case, the bombers used low intensity explosives. None of the people hurt or killed was of political value - though they were, of course, of personal and national value. These included innocent people escorting the apparent targets. The main targets escaped without a scratch. While it is welcome that they survived, the larger issue needs resolving. </p> <p>The drivers in the corps commander's and prime minister-designate's cars were killed, but the other passengers escaped unscathed. It is difficult to believe that bombers would repeatedly use low-intensity explosives so that only one occupant of the car being attacked - or a person outside the car - would die. A public commission into these attacks is needed. </p> <p>The second crucial development since September 11 2001 has been the rise of religious extremists. There appear to be groups in both the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds who believe that a clash of civilisations is needed for religious reasons. The Christian fundamentalists believe that Christ will be resurrected once the people of the Jewish faith are resettled on the banks of the Euphrates. The Muslim extremists believe that the Mahdi will arrive when the battle between Muslims and non-Muslims intensifies. </p> <p>This political scenario is threatening to undo the entire global social fabric built since the end of the second world war - one based on the tolerance between different faiths, races, genders and cultures. A clash of civilisations can lead to Armageddon, where there will be no winners on earth. But perhaps the religious extremists are not searching for winners on earth. </p> <p>The challenge for the world community is to emphasise values of tolerance, moderation and inter-faith understanding, on which rest the pillars of a less violent world. However, the bombing of the World Trade Centre and the events in Iraq have made that more difficult. The former led to suspicion against Muslims and a loss of civil liberties; the latter to a counter-suspicion from Muslims as to the real purposes of the war. The inability to find weapons of mass destruction and the Abu Ghraib abuses undermined the reasons given for the Iraq war. </p> <p>While global attention is focused on terrorism, the crisis of poverty is effectively disregarded. Today, big business seems to be in the driving seat. One recent report found that while 20 years ago CEOs made an average of 40 times more than factory workers, last year it was 400 times more, and is now climbing to a multiple of 500. </p> <p>This staggering rise in the fortunes of those on top, while those below suffer, is a festering sore that has the potential to erupt. The recent Indian elections showed that a stock-market economy alone could not make India shine. The Indian electorate went against all predictions, as peasants, labourers and the middle classes voted for change. Similarly, in Pakistan the talk of stock market rises and foreign exchange increases hides a more troubling picture. This is one of increasing poverty, hunger, misery and frustration. The numbers of young people killing themselves because of hunger was 1,200 in six months. These are the officially recorded figures - the real figures are believed to be much higher. </p> <p>In Pakistan, the average income has been shrinking. The cost of living is rising sharply. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the ordinary citizen to pay fat utility bills and buy the basic necessities of life. The Pakistan Economic Survey admits that poverty has increased since democracy was derailed in 1996. The gap between the rich and the poor is growing at an alarming rate. The war against terrorism is primarily perceived as a war based on the use of force. However, economics has its own force, as does the desperation of families who cannot feed themselves. A more stable world depends on the ability to use force when necessary - and to seek political solutions when possible. After all, force is the prelude to achieving a more favourable negotiating position in a political settlement. </p> <p>Militancy and greed cannot become the defining images of a new century that began with much hope. As the body count rises in Iraq, as a leading NGO pulls out of Afghanistan and as a suicide attack takes place against Pakistan's prime minister designate, the time has come to rethink. By returning to the values of democracy, the will of the people, broad-based government and building institutions that can respond to the people, the social malaise can be addressed. </p> <p>The neglect of rising poverty against the background of religious extremism can only complicate an already difficult world situation. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Benazir Bhutto is chairperson of the Pakistan People's party and a former prime minister of Pakistan </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:bashirriaz@aol.com\">bashirriaz@aol.com</a></p>",
  "A faded piece of paper has been pinned to the noticeboard in the tiny office of Alec Jeffreys in Leicester University's genetics building for almost two decades. Covered in odd black splodges, the scrap looks utterly nondescript - only luck could have saved it from overzealous cleaners. Yet the document is of unprecedented scientific importance, for it is a copy of the world's first DNA fingerprint, a technology that has revolutionised society and is about to celebrate its 20th anniversary. <p>Thanks to DNA fingerprinting, it is now possible to identify criminals from a few cells left at a crime scene; pinpoint errant fathers in paternity cases; settle disputed immigration cases; and show within hours that a bearded, dishevelled man found hiding in an Iraqi bunker is indeed Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Once it was possible to lead a discreet, anonymous life, now our movements can be laid bare by forensic genetics: a power that has already affected millions of people, including criminals, suspects, policemen, immigrants, parents, offspring and lawyers. It has even become the subject of TV voyeurism, with teenage fathers being told on live TV whether or not they are the biological fathers of their partners' babies. </p> <p>And in future, as the technique's power is enhanced even further, samples will provide not just names but information about suspects' race, hair colour and facial features. 'Imagine DNA details about racial groups falling into the hands of some governments or organisations,' Jeffreys said last week. 'It is not a pleasant prospect.' </p> <p>The first 20 years of DNA fingerprinting may have been sensational, but the next 20 years are likely to be incendiary, although revolution was far from Jeffreys's mind on 10 September, 1984, when as a young geneticist - a grammar school boy whose father was a designer at the Rover car plant in Cowley, Oxford - he completed an experiment to find out if repeated sections of DNA could be used to track inherited diseases through families. He had collected blood samples from a lab technician, her parents, several monkeys and, for good measure, a grey seal. Then he ran his tests. </p> <p>At first glance, his results, still enshrined on his noticeboard, not only differentiated between individual humans and animals but also established kinship patterns. 'It was a blinding flash,' Jeffreys recalled. 'I had been working on disease genes. The last thing I was thinking about was paternity suits or forensics. But I would have had to have been a complete idiot not to spot the implications.' </p> <p>With Home Office help, Jeffreys began a collaboration aimed at perfecting his technology. Within a year DNA fingerprinting was being used in courts to establish the authenticity of immigrants seeking entry to the UK because they were offspring of British citizens but whose claims were not accepted by officials. </p> <p>Jeffreys convinced sceptical lawyers his technique was sound and could establish kinships, and the technology was seized on by immigrant communities. By 1991 more than 18,000 DNA fingerprint tests were carried out on people seeking UK entry and 95 per cent were shown to be telling the truth. They are now UK citizens - thanks to DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>But the technology's real headline grabber followed the rapes and murders in Narborough, Leicestershire, of schoolgirls Lynda Mann, in 1983, and Dawn Ashworth, in 1986. A local man, Richard Buckland, confessed to killing Dawn. 'Prove he murdered Lynda as well,' the police asked Jeffreys. So he took semen samples from the girls' bodies and blood from Buckland. </p> <p>His results caused consternation, for they showed Dawn and Linda had indeed been raped by the same man but that the attacker could not have been Buckland. The police were unimpressed. Your technique is a dud, they told Jeffreys. 'I thought: oh, shit, they must be right - there's something wrong with it. The man had confessed, after all.' But Home Office researchers backed him and the police eventually recanted. Buckland was acquitted - thanks to DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>But there was a further twist to the story. After this setback, police requested all local men give blood samples and asked Jeffreys to test each against the samples found on Lynda and Dawn. Four thousand men provided samples until another local man, Colin Pitchfork, was eventually caught trying to avoid taking the test, admitted his guilt (later confirmed by DNA fingerprinting), and was sentenced to life imprisonment. 'It was a perfect result,' said Jeffreys, 'a combination of technology and good old-fashioned coppering. We became partners.' </p> <p>Since then, DNA tests have helped solve thousands of crimes. Swabs taken in minor crimes have pinpointed murderers who have evaded capture for decades. In addition, Jeffreys has used the technique to identify the remains of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, while others have used it to pinpoint the bones of Tsar Nicholas II, murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918. </p> <p>Portable DNA laboratories made it possible to prove, in less than a day, US soldiers had definitely captured Saddam Hussein. Now military scientists are working on hand-held devices that could do the job in minutes, while the Home Office is investigating ways in which DNA profiles could be used, with other techniques, as the basis of identity cards. </p> <p>It is quite a portfolio, though Jeffreys, since knighted and made a fellow of the Royal Society, remains largely unaffected by the revolution he has set in motion. He still takes his breaks outside his genetics building, propped against a wall while he smokes the tiny Golden Virginia roll-ups he has puffed for the past 35 years. He still has the beard he grew in his youth - to cover the facial burns received when he blew up his old chemistry set. And his office, with its old wooden shelves and a couple of beat-up chairs, appears unchanged since I last interviewed Jeffreys ten years ago. </p> <p>Indeed, far from being overawed by his achievements, the father of genetic fingerprinting is now startlingly realistic. 'Today unscrupulous investigators can easily get your DNA profile - from saliva on a coffee cup or cigarette butt - and then use it to show whether you are the \"real\" parent of your child,' he said. 'It's illegal but simple to do, and I am very sure it occurs quite often. It is a gross invasion of a person's privacy.' </p> <p>More worrying for Jeffreys are the attempts - which he derides as 'hocus-pocus' - of scientists to improve DNA fingerprinting in a bid to get round problems affecting its current use. There are 2.5 million samples on Britain's national database, but only half the DNA they find at crime scenes matches one of these. So researchers are now trying to find ways of determining a culprit's race or hair colour or face from this unmatched DNA. 'If these scientists are successful they will provide police with the means of working out people's racial and medical histories just from the DNA they leave behind. That is just not on.' </p> <p>Such fears explain Jeffreys's promotion of the idea of a global DNA database. Put everyone's DNA fingerprint on it, but ban any data on race, health or physical appearance, and such civil liberties' abuses will be avoided - provided proper security controls are implemented. Just consider the Pitchfork murders. 'If we had had a global database at the time, we would have got him straight after the first crime. We would have saved a life. That is just one case. Now imagine that repeated thousands of times across the UK.' </p> <p>It remains to be seen if the issues raised by a global DNA database will allow it to become reality, though Jeffreys remains confident. 'I know David Blunkett has looked at the idea, but has done nothing yet, though I still think it is the answer to our current problems.' </p> <p>Jeffreys's invention has now touched more than 10 million lives, he estimates. It is a worldwide business and generates \u00a31 billion in annual revenues. Most royalties go to the Lister Institute, which employed Jeffreys in 1984, though a small sum has trickled through to the scientist. 'I used it to buy a cottage in Cornwall,' he said. 'And I shall be there this weekend. You see - crime does pay.' </p> <p><b>Cracking the code</b></p> <p><b>Alec Jeffreys's</b> invention exploits the fact that our genes contain random, apparently useless bits of DNA that are repeated in ways that are unique to an individual. </p> <p><b>DNA fingerprints</b> are made by breaking open cells and cutting up their DNA contents using special chemicals, called restriction enzymes, in order to isolate their sections of DNA repeats. The resulting fragments are then sorted out according to size. By labelling them with radioactive probes, the next step is to make mono images - producing a unique bar-code. It is then possible to establish kinship patterns as a mother and father will pass on their bar codes to offspring. </p> <p><b>There have been</b> several key modifications and developments to fingerprinting. With genetic amplification it is now possible to create millionfold copies of gene fragments, so that a handful of cells, too small to be seen by the naked eye, can provide sufficient material to make a DNA fingerprint.</p>",
  "<p>This Q &amp; A format was made for ethical living. It's all questions really: Why should I buy this? Who made it? What conditions do they work in? Some might say we only have the luxury of asking questions because we're part of a consumer society. That's probably true. If we were among the 2.8bn people worldwide who survive on less than $2 a day, we wouldn't have time to ask. In that way I'm pleased to be on this side of the consumerist fence. However, according to the research organisation Worldwatch Institute, excessive consumption also brings higher levels of obesity and debt, severe time shortages and a degraded environment. Counteracting these problems means rethinking a lot of unthinking behaviours. Living more ethically requires a Miss Marple-like fastidiousness when it comes to shopping and demands questioning almost all bits of received wisdom. But the strange thing is, once you get over the fallacy of the convenience of modernday life, living more ethically becomes a liberating antidote to the live-to-work consumer culture.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I dye my hair dark, but now I'm worried by reports that hair dye is bad for my health. What's the alternative? <br><strong>Belinda, Exeter</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The Romans used vinegar and the Elizabethans a mix of potash and rhubarb. Our age favours a brew of chemical carcinogens, slathered on to the highly sensitive scalp, where toxins can be absorbed into the bloodstream. So you're right to be concerned.</p> <p>To get rid of grey, you really have to use a permanent dye and this will normally bring you into contact with arylamines - pernicious chemicals linked to bladder cancer. We should also spare a thought for the professional crimpers who spend all day mixing and applying this stuff. A Swedish study found increased risk of birth defects for the children of hairdressers exposed to some hair dyes.</p> <p>I like the attitude in Aveda salons. The emphasis is on fewer toxic products which give more natural-looking results and on avoiding petroleum-based ingredients (conventional dyes are full of non-renewable petroleum ingredients). Some 99 per cent of ingredients in Aveda's demi-permanent dyes and 97 per cent of ingredients in permanent dyes are made from plant-based ingredients. </p> <p>Alternatively, try a DIY solution, with a brand certified by the Soil Association. Aubrey Organics is a US brand, relatively new to these shores. The EU has been famously tardy in outlawing the testing of cosmetics on animals - now scheduled for 2013 - but <a href=\"http://www.aubrey-organics.com\">Aubrey Organics</a> has shunned testing for 33 years, nor will it accept any historical animal testing results. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Should I put my paper out for the recycling collection or shred it and put it in my composting bin? <br><strong>Catherine, Brixton</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> After kitchen waste, paper is the second biggest ingredient in bins and 5m tonnes gets dumped in landfill sites every year. Less than half is recovered, even though the paper industry wreaks havoc ecologically with industrial harvesting of virgin forests and the carving of logging routes into remote ecosystems. Paper bleaching, along with plastics manufacture, is also the biggest source of dangerous dioxin emissions. </p> <p>Save crumpled or soiled paper for the compost bin. You needn't shred it first. (Definitely don't shred it to be recycled; the short fibres make it difficult to recover.) Instead, scrunched-up paper creates air pockets in the compost mix, helping your heap or bin to thrive. The best home for shredded paper is in a worming bin, where it makes great bedding (another way of diverting waste from landfill). </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Is it OK to have a second home if I use solar energy there? <br><strong>Gavin, Bath</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The second home is becoming an incredibly thorny social and environmental issue. As a second-home owner you may feel you actually contribute a lot through your extra house. In Appledore, in Devon, dubbed Britain's 'second home' capital, one in 10 homes is an extra residence; here, council tax for weekenders has increased from 50 per cent to 90 per cent, and other councils have followed suit. You could even argue that as a weekend visitor you bring extra economic benefits to the community, by providing custom. </p> <p>However, there's no denying that second homes price local people out of the housing market. They also exclude some key workers, such as school or hospital staff, who may be vital to the area.</p> <p>You don't say where your second home is, so it could be abroad. Last year, 50,000 Brits bought a home overseas. On average they will make six trips a year to visit these properties, fuelling the ever-expanding market for cheap flights. Such flights might seem cheap, but the negative impact of air travel on the environment is verging on the catastrophic - it is two to four times greater than any other form of transport. </p> <p>Where there are language and cultural barriers, you're increasingly unlikely to be active in your weekend community. In this case, the place in the sun is merely a means of escaping one community and swapping it for somebody else's, without really contributing to either, with or without solar panels.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I want to replace my current car with a more environmentally sound model. What's the best option? <br><strong>Bethan, Swansea</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I'm duty bound to suggest the bus, but I know that's not what you're after, so I'll nominate the <a href=\"http://www.goingreen.co.uk\">G-Wiz</a>. Small yet perfectly formed, this little car is just 2.6m long (that's smaller than a Smart car). According to the Energy Saving Trust it's also the most energy-efficient on the road. At \u00a35,599 to buy (this includes a \u00a31,000 government Power Swift grant) and \u00a31.62 a day to run, it's the cheapest of eco cars. It's also exempt from road tax, and many parking spaces are free. </p> <p>Of course, there are downsides. The G-Wiz is charged from a normal electric socket (to be truly emissions free you must have a green, renewable tariff) and takes about two-and-a-half hours to charge up to 80 per cent capacity. The top speed is 40mph, but seeing as the average UK journey is just eight miles, that's not a handicap. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Is it true that I can offset the impact of flying and heating my home by signing up to a carbon-neutral scheme? <br><strong>Tom, Leamington Spa</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Basically, the idea is that you offset the greenhouse gases you create during normal life by financing a tree-planting project, or investing in renewable technologies. Celebrities have been signing up to carbon neutrality in their droves. </p> <p>In the case of high-profile fans such as Coldplay, the Rolling Stones and, er, Dido, they want to offset the emissions caused by touring, CD production and huge stadia concerts. </p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.futureforests.com\">Future Forests</a> (0870 199 9988) is the leader of carbon-neutral schemes. Founded by the late Joe Strummer, front man of the Clash, the website calculates how much pollution a trip has caused and tells you how many trees need to be planted to 'neutralise' the carbon emissions released into the atmosphere - one tree costs \u00a38.50.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this all smacks of having your carbon cake and eating it. According to research, trees have a much more limited 'sink function' than first thought, ie they do not absorb as much carbon. Critics claim that for carbon neutrality to stand any chance, trees would need to cover the whole country and not just small areas of Scotland. Meanwhile, 'neutralising' fossil-fuel emissions can actually legitimise wasteful behaviours. Not emitting greenhouse gases in the first place is better than trying to soak up emissions afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Instead of going on holiday this year, I'd like to raise money by participating in a sponsored trek or cycle ride somewhere remote. Is this a good idea? <br><strong>Andrew, Winchester</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> This still counts as a holiday. The expedition, sponsored or otherwise, is essentially a form of ecotourism; the fortnight in Spain has been superseded by missions to save orang-utans, trek across the Himalayas or canoe down the Zambezi.</p> <p>But what do these trips do for the remote area you're visiting? Tourism can change a region forever, and seldom for the better. The charity Survival International makes the point that Himalayan fields lie uncultivated because the men who once farmed them, and consequently provided food for the region, have become porters on climbing expeditions. </p> <p>Research is key. Before you sign up, you need to make sure the company you're going with has watertight ecological and social credentials. </p> <p>What is the likely impact of the trip on the local environment? Will the money you raise benefit that environment? If you can't guarantee any of this, then get sponsored to run a local marathon for the charity, followed by a fortnight on the Costa Del Sol recuperating.</p>",
  "<p>It was a while before I realised that other children didn't do what we did at the seaside. They went windsurfing or on donkey rides, or spent their pocket money at funfairs. But my family went looking for food: my snapshot memories of those summers are all hunter-gatherer scenes: my brother sliding down cliffs to snatch gulls' eggs, Dad wrestling with the ancient outboard as our tiny lobster-potting boat drifted further out to sea, my little sister busy on the beach stuffing a jelly-fish in her mouth. Well, she liked jelly. </p> <p>Tiree, the Hebridean island where my four brothers and sisters and I spent most of our summer holidays, is thus the only place where I know I'd never starve. I know how to eat everything you can gather on its rocky coast and bone-white beaches: razor shells, cockles, mussels, whelks, carrageen seaweed, winkles, crabs (velvet and red), conger eel, mackerel. This lore was passed on by my mother who had spent many of her childhood holidays on the same beaches, as had her mother before. </p> <p>We were proud of living off the island - I was Mowgli, living wild, except my jungle had no trees, just an expanse of wind, sky and water with a trace of low green land squeezed between them. Tiree doesn't look promising if you arrive on the ferry on a day when the rain clouds are crowding in from the west. But one of the island's many Gaelic names is 'Land of Plenty'. Another is 'Land Below the Waves'. </p> <p>Off the land there were mushrooms, snails in the dry-stone walls, watercress in the ditches, rock pigeon and hare - my brother had a lurcher dog called Jess. She would run down hares on the grassy dune-land and then sit looking innocent by the dead animal until we came and picked it up. The island's one butcher's shop sold - and still sells - the world's greatest cuts of lamb, sweet and tender from a life spent grazing the Hebridean clover. In season, you can buy the exquisite little new potatoes that the crofters grow in the island's sandy soil. There is a Co-op, for essentials - how we mocked the holidaymakers who we found buying fish fingers. Ridiculous, with all that food sitting out there. </p> <p>It must sound a bit like boot camp. It's true that we spent most of the daylight hours working for our stomachs - looking for food, working out ways of catching food, helping get the food ready. But it was adventure and luxury. My mother told us that we could eat the most expensive, delicious food in the world here - for free! Which would obviously make it taste better. This made an impression. 'Do you know how much French people pay for six snails? A month's pocket money!' my older sister and I would brag. We ate them for nothing, as many as we liked. The skittering velvet crabs, so numerous they were a pest in the lobster pots, were a delicacy in Spain. Sometimes planes would land on the island, buy a load from the fishermen, and fly them to Madrid. And lobsters: 'Millionaires eat lobsters!' But, my mother said, we ate better lobsters than millionaires - because ours were fresh from the Scottish sea. </p> <p>She was right. I can't to this day eat a lobster happily in a city restaurant - unless, perhaps, someone else is paying for it. Nowadays most are imported semi-frozen from the other side of the Atlantic. Rubbery, empty of flavour, they just don't taste anything like those royal blue monsters fresh from the lobster pots in the Sound of Gunna. Eating a lobster was childhood's best treat - an epic event. By the time we'd finished sucking the sweet watery contents from the antennae and all of the eight legs, the family had been at the table for two hours. One of my sisters gave a horrified account of her first restaurant lobster - bought by a boyfriend somewhere smart in London. 'It cost \u00a320 and that was just for the tail and claws. They didn't even give me the head! I asked for them to bring it back from the kitchen and they said they'd thrown it away.' </p> <p>In the sea around the island we would potter with Dad in a tiny boat on the days - often rare, even in summer - when the waves had no white caps and Mull's blue mountains showed clear, 15 miles away across the water. We'd fish for lobster-pot bait with feathered hooks and sometimes hit a shoal of mackerel, their sharp tugs on the handline thrilling compared to the duller pull of the tasteless saithe (coley) we caught for the pots. If you hit the mackerel, you could find yourself pulling up six on a line at a time - we would shout with excitement. Fresh mackerel are a feast - utterly different from the dull and flabby things in the supermarket. These were muscular daggers, petrol blue and dashed with iridescent rainbow, when we pulled them, fighting, into the boat. We'd fry them as soon as we got home in butter and oatmeal and eat them on toast. The flesh was so firm your teeth seemed to creak when you bit into it: my mouth waters thinking about them. </p> <p>Almost every outing - picnic, swimming trip or exploration - was a hunter-gathering adventure. On rainy days, we'd go to the ferry pier on Gott Bay. Here, while the younger children dangled worms on hooks to catch the tiny fish that swarmed around the piles, my oldest sister and I would climb down a rusty ladder to balance on a crossbeam just above the waves. There you could wrestle clusters of huge mussels off the girders, and then scramble back up, the heavy buckets slipping from our hands. </p> <p>Mussels were a hassle: the excitement of collecting them was followed by the long chore of chipping away the barnacles, your cold hands stinging with tiny cuts, until they were ready for my mother's sumptuous moules marini\u00e8res. (Later, my brother invented a brilliant system - steam them open, pull them from their shells, rinse and sieve - no need for the cleaning. But that way you don't get the fabulous pile of gleaming midnight-blue shells, stacked over the broth of wine and cream.) These mussels tasted like no others. They grew so big and juicy on the ferry pier, it was said, because nearby was the exit point of the little town of Scarinish's sewage pipe. So my mother would always have the first plate of mussels of the holidays: 'Just to test them - it's better if I die of food poisoning than if everyone does.' But we children always suspected this wasn't so much martyrdom as plain greed. </p> <p>Picnics for the seven of us were a major logistical operation. As every parent knows, a picnic takes 15 minutes' preparation per participant. That's only just enough time to round up the gear and the children, find fleeces and macs and wellingtons, and get everyone into the car. We had to pile all the food-finding gear in as well. Cockle rakes, shrimp nets, buckets. An old saucepan, some newspapers to light a driftwood fire, and a shelf from the oven to act as a grill. The only food really necessary was bread, butter, perhaps a container of salad. And, crucially, salt and a jar of Hellmann's mayonnaise. </p> <p>Our picnics also had to be timed by the tides. Ideally we'd get to the beach - not very hard, since it is difficult on Tiree to get out of sight of the sea - just as the water was approaching its lowest. This exposes the greatest playground on the planet - seaweed gardens, rock pools with whole societies of sea animals, swathes of sand to build castles in before the tide returns. And of course, the low tide exposes food. </p> <p>There's no shortage of this. Most Scottish rock pools are full of winkles, their round olive-green or brown shells as easy to pick as daisies on a lawn. Between the rocks we pushed our shrimping nets, scooping up tiny baby flounders and the translucent shrimps, sometimes as long as a child's finger. Boiled they went pink, with a fine grainy texture and salty taste quite unlike prawns - but not hugely interesting. So we melted butter and a little garlic and parsley and potted them. After a few hours in the fridge, you can spread them on toast. </p> <p>Just as the tide restarts its invasion of the beach is the best time to catch the cockles that lurk under the sand. If you were lucky you could feel their hardness in the wet sand with your bare toes and pounce on them before they burrowed deeper. If we found one, that meant there would be more: we would jump up and down across the sand - somebody once said that this brought the cockles to the surface, and though this was never truly proven, a mass jumping session became part of the ritual. Then we'd dig a trench across the likely area with a garden fork, the children diving into the holes to grab the ridged double-shells. We kept an eye open for strangers. The spots on the beaches where cockles lurk are rare and move mysteriously. So if a group of tourists wandered past we'd stop pogoing on the tide line and pretend to be digging sandcastles so that they would not learn the secret location of our cocklemine. They must have thought we were completely bonkers. </p> <p>Picking winkles is much easier: put to work, a team of toddlers can get half a bucket in a few minutes, and they cook just as quickly. At my ideal picnic, in a cove under Tiree's sole mildly impressive hill, Ceann a'Mhara, others have already gathered driftwood and lit the fire while the beach crew has gathered the shellfish. The bread is buttered. The saucepan has a couple of inches of seawater in the bottom of it, simmering, so we can pour the winkles straight from the bucket. (This bit can be painful - winkles are strangely charming and it is not easy boiling a mollusc your child has just given a name to.) But after a couple of minutes they are ready. There is no explaining to people who don't know them the peculiar pleasure of winkles - a subtle, bitter-nutty flavour and a fascinating rubber band texture. Last summer, with great ceremony, I prised one from a shell with a genuine winkle-picker - a safety pin - for my four-year-old son's induction to the Joy of Winkles. He looked at it and screamed, predictably, 'bogey!' Children don't know how lucky they are. </p> <p>I think they are much more interesting than snails. Eat them on bread or oatcakes - the only thing to drink with them is thick Scottish tea or malt whisky. So obviously addictive are winkles, when you get started, that my brother once planned a business freeze-drying them to sell next to the pork scratchings in pubs. </p> <p>The only British chefs that I know of who can find time for winkles are Rick Stein, who puts them in his Padstow fruits de mer, and of course Fergus and Margot Henderson, the proprietors of London's St John restaurant, prophets of the real-food movement. Fergus picked his first winkles on Tiree, too. </p> <p>We spent more time and more thought on lobster-potting than anything else. My parents had learnt the tricks of the trade from Donald Kennedy, who was the island's postmaster and a friend from my mother's childhood. It was according to his precise instructions that we laid our three pots. The bait was the coley we'd caught on those fishing expeditions, left to lie in a barrel for a day or two until it had started to stink - getting the bait from the barrel was my least favourite job. In our little boat we'd steer among the rocks until the perfect spot was found; not too shallow, not too deep, just on the edge of the sea-tangle. Then we'd drop the pot, pay out its rope, make sure it was set so the high tide wouldn't carry it out to sea. </p> <p>A day later we'd go to lift the pots. Leaning over the side of the boat, you'd watch intently as the shapes coalesced while the pot came up from the darkness. Was something there? Was it seaweed? A crab? Several crabs? Or, and as the pot surfaced, water dripping, there could be a furious blue shape, trimmed with gold, claws up ready to fight - a lobster! </p> <p>It was rare to see a pot come up with nothing. And everything could be eaten - even the giant whelks that sometimes swarm a pot disgustingly could be boiled for hours (and still keep the texture of car tyres). Conger eels, some as long as my father's leg, were hard to deal with but good to eat - we tried to smoke them by sticking them up the chimney and burning pine driftwood underneath. The crabs, in good years, were so numerous, you would throw back all but the bestlooking ones. </p> <p>Tiree is a harsh and beautiful place. Though the beaches are glorious, it's not Scotland as advertised: there are no beautiful lochs and Tiree boasts probably the least impressive ben in the whole of the country. But as a kindergarten for a foodie, there was nowhere else. </p> <p><strong>Snails with wine and garlic</strong> </p> <p>serves 6 </p> <p>approx 72 snails<br>1 bay leaf<br>1/2 bottle white wine<br>knob of butter<br>ground pepper<br>1 clove garlic crushed<br>1 tsp cayenne pepper </p> <p>Clean snails until the water runs clear, put them in a saucepan and cover with cold water.

In the evening (dinner \u00a325), St Ives Bay mackerel are popular simply grilled with herb salad. It's no surprise that the owners come from London; this is every urbanite's dream. </p> <p><strong>Wheelers Oyster Bar</strong><br>8 High Street, Whitstable, Kent<br>(01227 273311) </p> <p>This tiny 'oyster parlour' has three tables and seafood bar that seats only four.

If you can, bring your own wine (there's no corkage). </p> <p><strong>Oyster Shack</strong><br>Stakes Hill, Bigbury, Devon<br>(01548 810876) </p> <p>This former oyster farm next to the tidal road floods twice a day. Don't worry though - the rustic charm of the place is not about to be swept aside. Alfresco lunches may well be extended to dinners, the evenings warmed by heaters and your own wine supplemented by a short in-house list. Otherwise it's plain home cooking as usual with locally sourced fish. </p> <p><strong>The Company Shed</strong><br>129 Coast Road, West Mersea, Essex<br>(01206 382700) </p> <p>About twice a month the coast road floods and the tide comes up to the door of this wooden shed, which doubles as fishmonger and impromptu lunch venue looking out over the fishing boats and pleasure cruisers. You can't book and it's always full - perhaps because a typical platter of whole crab, smoked salmon, smoked mackerel, cockles, prawns and mussels costs just \u00a38.You bring the wine and the bread and butter.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 15 2004</strong></p> <p> Readers tempted to follow advice given in the article below to move their washing machine from kitchen to bathroom should contact the manufacturer to ensure that the appliance is suitable for bathroom installation. The electricity supply must be protected by a residual operating current. Contact the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) for further advice or visit <a href=\"http://www.eca.co.uk\">Eca.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>  </p> <p>On the day of Jenny Morris's visit, our kitchen is inexplicably filled with flies. I say inexplicably, but as Jenny - the doyenne of food safety and hygiene - is about to tell me, no unwelcome visitor to the domestic kitchen is there without an invitation from a slapdash cook. It's the hottest day of the year and the back door and windows are wide open. Something must be luring the flies in. 'That bin is the problem,' Jenny observes in her matronly, Margaret Thatcher way, inspecting the US-style trash can (Jerry's Home Store, circa 1995) with its letterbox lid hanging limply open and a disposable nappy clearly poking out the top. 'It's not just that the spring is broken, but you have to touch it every time you throw anything away. Your hands pick up bacteria and transfer them to food, which is why you should wash them regularly. A pedal bin is better, even if it's less fashionable.' </p> <p>I can see where things are heading. Here I am, confidently inviting an environmental health officer (EHO) to watch me cook, secure in the belief that our kitchen is pristine and my culinary habits impeccable - and already I have failed. 'What shall I do about the flies?' I ask flatly, expecting Jenny to recommend Vapona fly-paper strips or a repellent device - but her solution is low-tech. 'Give all kitchen surfaces a good wash down before you start,' she says, 'using hot soapy water. That should be done every time, regardless of the weather. After that, don't leave out any food on which flies are likely to settle; if you do, cover it.' </p> <p>It's a sobering thought, that no meal should be prepared without scrubbing up like a surgeon and scrubbing down like a deckhand - but that is the reality of cooking in a British summer. July and August are peak months for cases of infectious intestinal disease (IID), characterised by diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and passed from person to person. The condition accounts for 10.5 million cases a year and costs the country \u00a3750 million in healthcare bills and lost working days. Of these cases, perhaps 2.4 million are directly caused by food poisoning and, in particular, fly-borne bacteria. Feeding alternately on filth (notably faeces) and sweet foods (such as sugar and milk), houseflies regurgitate their first meal on their second, trample it to a slurry with their feet and siphon it up, leaving behind bacteria trapped among their leg hairs. 'You never know where flies have been,' says Jenny, 'so you don't want to take any risks.' </p> <p>Nor is it just insects that are at their most active in the warmer months. Thanks to inept barbecuing (which leaves bacteria alive in undercooked meat), mass outdoor catering (which spreads infection), poor personal hygiene, defective refrigerators and rapidly deteriorating food, the bacteria associated with poor animal husbandry also have a field day. Farm animals harbour organisms in their gut which are spread to the outside of meat at the time of slaughter; eggs and milk can also be tainted by the disease and fecundity of the farmyard. In August, cases of salmonellosis (caused by the salmonella bacterium) increase fourfold compared with January, while campylobacteriosis (from the campylobacter bug associated with poultry) doubles. Though both organisms can be killed by thorough cooking at high temperatures, they can be transferred to foods such as salad which will not be cooked - typically when the juices from raw meat and poultry drip onto the shelf below in the fridge. This is cross-contamination. </p> <p>So significant is the problem that the Food Standards Agency has set itself the target of achieving a 20 per cent reduction in food-poisoning cases by 2006, focusing its campaign on five micro-organisms that are rampant during the summer months: salmonella, campylobacter and clostridium perfringens (responsible for the largest number of cases) and listeria and E.coli 0157 (which causes more severe illness in fewer people). In June, the Food and Drink Federation - assisted by the FSA and others - ran a National Food Safety Week highlighting how bacteria are spread. 'Are You A Chicken Splasher?' its campaign literature asked, referring to a finding that 81 per cent of Britons rinse poultry under the kitchen tap before cooking it, splattering bacteria over sink, work surfaces, utensils and themselves. </p> <p>'That is classic cross-contamination,' Jenny Morris explains, 'which is one of the Food Standard Agency's four Cs [used in its campaign as an aide-memoir for avoiding food poisoning]. The other three are cleaning, cooking and chilling.' It is against these criteria that my performance will be judged by Jenny (who, as well as being an EHO, is policy officer for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health). To make things worse, I have chosen ingredients and methods notorious for their food-poisoning potential: frozen scallops, king prawns, fresh raw tuna and cod, sliced, marinated in lemon juice and threaded on skewers with red and yellow peppers and courgettes. These kebabs will be lightly grilled (to simulate barbecuing) and served with new potatoes and a salad of organic red batavia lettuce, Little Gem leaves, wild rocket and vine tomatoes. My pact with Jenny is that I will behave as I do when preparing a family meal; I must not sanitise my technique on account of her presence. Armed with a probe thermometer and a critical demeanour, she will judge my food safety and my personal hygiene. </p> <p>First, there is the bacteriological can of worms that is our fridge - an ancient, leaking Hotpoint bought for \u00a320 from the previous owner of the house. 'I'll just leave the thermometer in here for a while,' says Jenny, as I pick up an abrasive sponge - our only abrasive sponge - and begin scrubbing the new potatoes. Wiping down the board I chopped them on, I take my medley of fish and seafood from the fridge, where the scallops have been defrosting overnight. I can see Jenny taking notes. A quick slash with the knife, a squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and pepper, and the fish and vegetables are ready for assembly on skewers. Brushing the kebabs with olive oil, I stick them under the grill and start preparing the salad. Jenny takes her thermometer from the fridge, looks at it through narrowed eyes, then sticks its probe into a can of tuna covered in Clingfilm, leftover from the night before. She closes the door and retrieves the thermometer later. </p> <p>Oddly, like the unprecedented flies, the grill undermines my confidence on the very day I am being held up to scrutiny. Our gleaming Smeg cooker which we cherish like a baby (even using Johnson's baby oil to maintain its mirror-like sheen) takes nearly half an hour to grill one side of the kebabs. There is plenty of time to chat. I discover that Jenny has been both a chef and a caterer before becoming an EHO - so my meal will be judged for its culinary merits as well as micro-biologically. </p> <p>'It's all very tasty,' she says politely at my hour of reckoning, when we eventually sit down to a plateful of pale, fashionably underdone kebabs and a fly-blown salad. 'I haven't seen anything so bad it makes me not want to eat it.' Without warning, she whips out her thermometer and thrusts it deep into a scallop, retrieving the device after two minutes. Is it my imagination, or does she look worried? 'It's 59 ,' she announces, 'but to kill all the bacteria you need to achieve 70 at the centre for two minutes. Wouldn't it be good for your story if we both went down with food poisoning?' I laugh nervously. </p> <p> <strong> How the bacteria stacked up </strong></p> <p><strong> Chopping boards </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> mine is expensive and constructed from a single piece of wood. 'Those made from several pieces are glued together,' says Jenny, 'and if the glue starts to give, you have lots of gaps for food-trapping and bacteria.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> although there are two boards in the house, I am too lazy to use the second. The same one is used for raw fish and seafood as for chopping vegetables and salad, albeit with a good wash down in between. Theoretically, I turn it over when I switch from raw fish to vegetables - but I can't recall which side I'm on. It's a perfect recipe for contamination. </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> 'In a domestic kitchen, it's a very good idea to have more than one board,' says Jenny, 'ideally in different shapes or colours, so you can differentiate. Anything \"dirty\" - raw meat and fish - would be prepared on one, and all the \"clean\" stuff - salads and sandwiches - on the other.' </p> <p>Commercial food businesses use heavy-duty plastic or polypropylene boards, which are the most hygienic, and Jenny recommends them. 'If you have only one board,' she advises, 'spray it after use with a sanitiser, an antibacterial spray such as Dettox, then wipe it dry with a piece of kitchen towel. Because the risk of cross-contamination is so high, I might not rely on hot soapy water.' </p> <p> <strong> Cloths and sponges </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> there really isn't one. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> 'It's one of your big failings,' says Jenny, witheringly. 'You have a major cross-contamination issue with your cloths.' To begin with, I used the same abrasive sponge to scrub muddy potatoes as I did to wipe down the board on which I prepared salad - spreading farm bacteria everywhere. Then, after chopping raw fish and seafood, I used the same sponge again to swab down kitchen surfaces. 'Even though you rinsed it out,' says Jenny, 'it has potential bacteria traps because it is abrasive.' </p> <p>That was certainly the finding of a University of Westminster study examining the fingertips of subjects after using different types of cloth: for a sponge, the count was 65.8 colonies of bacteria on the fingers compared with 39.7 for a dishcloth and zero for a paper towel. Some 83 per cent of sponges examined showed a 'high' rate of contamination after one day's use (with more than a billion bacteria present, rising to 10 billion after several days). As the study's stomach-churning summary pointed out, the source of bacteria 'varied from water to the human gut, respiratory tract and skin' and included E. coli, salmonella and the distinctly unappetising enterococcus faecalis. </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> use different cloths or sponges for different tasks - 'That's my clean cloth, the yellow one; that's my dirty cloth, the blue one,' suggests Jenny. Failing that, boil, bleach or disinfect cloths regularly (ideally every day) or throw them away. Non-woven dish cloths are better than sponges because they have fewer 'traps' where germs can hide, and hold less water, which helps bacteria thrive. </p> <p> <strong> The freezer </strong></p> <p> <strong>Upside: </strong> everything in it is still frozen! The scallops were defrosted in the fridge, not the open air - 'the correct way to do it', says Jenny. 'A lot of research has been done on defrosting,' she explains, 'and the recommendation is to do it in the fridge, where there are controlled conditions.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> I didn't check whether the scallops were thawed right through before using them. 'If that product is not defrosted at the core,' says Jenny, 'the little nugget of ice in the middle will cool the scallop down and stop it cooking properly.' The result: serious food poisoning. I also splashed water from the scallop bag on to the kitchen surface - a cross-contamination issue - and put the unsealed bag back in the fridge next to a tub of hummus. 'Those juices can contaminate other things,' Jenny warns. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> press defrosted food with your fingers to check it is thawed, or even run a skewer through it. Be careful with defrosted juices, which carry bacteria. </p> <p> <strong> The fridge </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside: </strong> to my amazement, Jenny gives this a clean bill of health. 'You've got reasonable separation,' she says, 'with your salad on the top and your meat below to avoid cross-contamination. Everything was covered properly and it gives the general impression of being clean.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> a fridge should operate at 1 C to 4 C to stop bacteria multiplying - but this one registered 9 C on Jenny's probe thermometer (after the door was opened briefly). A better indication was the tinned tuna, with a core temperature of 6.7 C. 'You are just within the legal limit for commercial premises, which is 8 C,' says Jenny, 'but the general safety recommendation is 5 C and below.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> buy a new fridge - or at the very least, a fridge thermometer. Turn up the temperature control in summer. </p> <p> <strong> The grill </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> it certainly looks attractive. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> it doesn't work. Maybe I omitted to turn it on fully, but it took an eternity to cook the kebabs. 'The danger with that,' Jenny points out, 'is that if something has been under the grill a long time, people assume it is cooked and don't check.' She checked, and found the core temperature of the fish was 58 C or 59 C. 'To make sure you have killed all the bacteria,' she warns, 'you need to achieve 70 C at the centre for a minimum of two minutes. The cooking temperature depends on the food product - and if that was a piece of chicken [notorious for bacteria], pork [known to contain parasites] or a burger [where the mincing process transfers surface bacteria to the core of the patty], you would have a potential problem.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> if the grilling is suspect, as with a barbecue, it's essential to cook very thoroughly. No fashionable pinkness, says Jenny, and no 'piercing with a skewer until the juices run clear'. That method, she found as a caterer, is far too subjective and it's better to cut through to the centre of the meat with a knife to check. Chicken, she argues, should never be served at a barbecue. 'Don't do it,' she says, 'because you can't cook it properly on account of its size. If you must, cook it in the oven and finish it over charcoal.' </p> <p> <strong> The hands </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> there is a bottle of antibacterial hand-wash by the kitchen sink. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> I never use it. 'I'm sorry,' observes Jenny, 'but you really don't wash your hands very often. You should definitely wash them before you begin and after handling raw fish or meat - but you didn't.' From fingertip to elbow, the average person has between two million and 10 million bacteria, according to Martin Paterson, deputy director general of the Food and Drink Federation. 'If you wear a ring,' he adds, 'there could be as many germs under it - 700 million - as there are people in Europe.' No wonder Jenny recoiled when I failed to wash my hands after assembling the (raw) fish kebabs. 'You went to find your oil brush,' she says, 'and you rooted through the kitchen drawer, touching many things. The handles of your utensils are now contaminated, the drawer handles are contaminated. Then you picked up your oil bottle, so the next person who touches it will pick up that contamination. They may be handling a salad next.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> wash hands regularly and do it properly. Most people neglect to clean around the thumbs, between the fingers, and around and under the nails, and the hands should be vigorously rubbed together for 15 seconds. Wet them before applying soap and dry them on kitchen towel: 1,000 times as many germs are spread from damp hands as from dry. </p> <p> <strong> The kitchen </strong></p> <p><strong> Upside:</strong> 'It looks clean,' Jenny pronounces. 'Nothing made me gasp in horror.' </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> the designer swing bin, with its lid flapping open and all kinds of fly fodder (including the baby's soiled nappies) inside. Less obvious is the washing machine, sited under food-preparation surfaces. 'Wherever there is moisture there is contamination spread by the aerosol [droplet] method.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy:</strong> 'Definitely get a new bin,' says Jenny. 'Whenever you prepare food, wash down all surfaces with hot soapy water as a precaution; you don't know whether flies have landed there or not. Thereafter, cover all food immediately. And re-plumb the washing machine in the bathroom.' </p> <p><strong> Knives </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside:</strong> we have a whole range to choose from in our Global knife-block, including - wait for it - a tomato knife. </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> the smallest, sharpest vegetable blade is the only one we ever use (except for cutting bread and carving meat) - for fish, seafood and vegetables. 'The biggest issue around that,' says Jenny, 'was the lemon used in the marinade. You sliced it with the knife used for the raw fish and put the remainder straight back in the fridge. That lemon now has raw fish on the edges - so if you use it in, say, a drink, there will be contamination. If it's a gin and tonic, the alcohol might kill the bacteria; if it's a soft drink, it won't.' The result? A bacteria cocktail. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> ideally, use different knives for different foods. Failing that, wash the knife thoroughly when going from meat or fish to food you will eat uncooked. 'I'd probably use the sanitiser spray again,' says Jenny. </p> <p><strong> Leftovers </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> 'This was fine,' says Jenny. (I'm usually such a pig, there are none.) </p> <p><strong> Downside:</strong> 'You need to think carefully about what you are going to do with this food afterwards.' It is very important to cool food down before it goes back in the fridge; the maximum recommended time is 90 minutes, after which it will attract flies and be at a perfect temperature for bacteria to multiply. Quick cooling is an art. 'If it's a great big container of stew left over, split it up into smaller bowls,' says Jenny. 'Instead of cooking a single large joint, have a couple of smaller ones or cut it to aid cooling.' One major problem is rice. 'There is a bacterium associated with it, bacillus cereus,' she explains, 'which has a nasty habit of producing spores when conditions are adverse. It is very resistant to heat.' When cooked rice is left in less than ideal conditions for four or five hours or overnight, spores are released and the bacteria multiply dangerously. Though associated with takeaway restaurants, bacillus cereus might be a problem when making rice salad - leaving cooked rice in the open air and making the salad later. People will eat that live bacteria. </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> 'The best way with rice is to cook it and eat it quickly,' says Jenny. 'If you want to re-use it, cool it very quickly and refrigerate it.' Some people do reheat rice successfully - that's what fried rice is - but it's safer to throw it away. </p> <p><strong> Tea towels </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> see cloths.</p> <p><strong> Downside: </strong> a cross-contamination disaster area. Tea towels hold a special place in the pantheon of food-poisoning risks, being damp, laden with bacteria from hands and decomposing food and typically kept on a warm radiator where bacteria thrive. 'A few years ago,' says Martin Paterson, 'we [the Food and Drink Federation] were highlighting tea towels because they are a major carrier of germs. People would go for six months without washing them; they'd just leave them sitting around on work surfaces. They are a huge source of contamination.' Jenny Morris also had a few things to say: 'I've noticed that you dry your hands on the tea towels,' she says. 'Again, you are transferring contamination on to those tea towels, and then you are using them to wipe down the chopping board you've just cleaned. You have possibly re-contaminated the board and the tea towels.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> 'You should never dry your hands on a tea towel,' Jenny insists. 'Kitchen roll is quite good. Don't use a tea towel on your chopping board; wash it, drain it and wipe the surface with a paper kitchen towel, which is for a single use.' Martin Paterson adds: 'Even for washing up, it's best to leave the dishes to drain, then use disposable cloths or paper towels.' Chuck your tea towels out. </p> <p><strong> Washing up </strong></p> <p><strong>Upside: </strong> I scored full marks - almost. After washing the dishes in warm, soapy water, I rinsed them in hot water (described by Jenny as 'best practice') and left them on the surface to drain. My wife would never allow this; she says I'm lazy. </p> <p><strong> Downside: </strong> though this is the best method when washing up by hand (because it avoids wiping, tea towels and contamination), it is far better to use a dishwasher. 'They typically operate in excess of 80 C,' says Jenny, 'because at about 82 C, water starts to act as a disinfectant. The heat is killing bacteria, which you can't achieve with a hand wash - even wearing rubber gloves. All the warm water is doing is loosening the dirt and grease from the plate. With rubbing and the penetration of the soap, this might get some of the bacteria off but it certainly won't kill them. What's more, if you don't change the water often enough, very soon it won't be hot soapy water; it will be a bacterial soup.' </p> <p><strong> Remedy: </strong> buy a dishwasher.</p> <p><strong>Guess whose coming to dinner</strong></p> <p><strong> Campylobacter </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> The most common food-poisoning bug in Britain, responsible for 43,445 cases in 2003 and causing about 80 deaths a year. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Raw and undercooked poultry, red meat, unpasteurised milk, untreated water. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Very potent. Just a few bacteria in a piece of undercooked chicken can cause severe illness. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Gastroenteritis with fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that is often bloody. The most serious cases can be fatal. </p> <p> <strong> Clostridium perfringens </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it? </strong> Officially, the third most common food bacterium in the UK, although the least reported because symptoms are vague and often dismissed as IID (infectious intestinal disease). In 2000 there were 166 confirmed cases but it is estimated that only one in 343 is notified. The real total could be closer to 57,000. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Soil, sewage, animal manure and the gut of animals and humans. It can easily be transferred to poultry, meat and meat products. Foods cooked slowly in large quantities, then left to stand for a long time, are its breeding ground. Particularly associated with leftover gravy and stuffing. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Clostridium perfringens can't be completely destroyed by ordinary cooking. It produces heat-resistant spores which may even be stimulated by high temperatures, causing the spores to germinate further. Unless infected food is eaten immediately, the bacteria will multiply rapidly as the food cools down. It must be reheated to 'piping hot' (ideally 75 C) to be safe. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> When ingested in large numbers, the bacteria produce toxins which attack the gut lining, causing diarrhoea and acute abdominal pain. </p> <p> <strong> E.coli 0157 </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Most strains of E.coli are harmless, but those producing the poison verocytoxin (VTEC) can cause severe illness. Of these, E.coli 0157 is the most common in Britain. A small number of cases (675 last year) have serious repercussions. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Farm animals and land contaminated with their faeces. Among foods, E.coli is transmitted most commonly through undercooked minced beef (such as burgers) and milk that is raw, inadequately pasteurised or contaminated after pasteurisation. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> The bacterium can spread directly from animals to humans and from person to person. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea. In serious cases, kidney failure, severe anaemia, neurological problems and death. </p> <p> <strong> Listeria </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Full name listeria monocytogenes, a food-poisoning bug of particular danger to pregnant women, babies and the elderly. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Everywhere in the environment, because it can survive at low temperatures (most bacteria require warmth to thrive). Foods most at risk are soft, mould-ripened cheeses, pt\u00e9s, unpasteurised milk and shellfish. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Resists heat, salt, nitrite (preservative) and acidity better than many micro-organisms. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Can be fatal to the elderly, the immune-impaired, infants and developing foetuses. </p> <p> <strong> Salmonella </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> The second most common cause of food poisoning after campylobacter (14,853 cases in 2003), widespread in eggs and poultry flocks in the 1980s. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Despite the poultry industry cleaning up its act with new codes of practice and the Lion Quality assurance scheme, salmonella is still found in eggs - at about the same levels as before the Edwina Currie debacle. Other sources are raw meat, poultry, unpasteurised milk, yeast - even pasta, coconut and chocolate. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Grows very well in the food itself, so a tiny number of bacteria will multiply to thousands of millions if the product is not chilled. Salmonella is also passed easily from person to person by poor hygiene, such as not washing hands. </p> <p> <strong> Symptoms</strong> Usually mild, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea but rarely vomiting. </p> <p> <strong> Scrombotoxin </strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> Not a bug as such, but a poison produced by certain bacteria present in oily fish which has been allowed to spoil through inadequate refrigeration. It causes a dramatic histamine reaction. </p> <p><strong> Where is it found?</strong> Fresh and tinned mackerel, tuna and, very rarely, Swiss cheese. </p> <p><strong> Party trick</strong> Once produced, the toxin is heat-resistant. Cooking, canning or freezing will have no effect. Contaminated food will not look, taste or smell any different from usual. </p> <p><strong> Symptoms</strong> Tingling or burning in the mouth, a rash on the face or upper body, itching, sweating and headache, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting may follow.</p>",
  "<p><strong> $</strong> </p> <p>2 Exmouth Market <br>London EC1 <br>020 7278 0077 </p> <p><strong> Cocktail Girl, is it true a lady should never be seen to strain her neck to drain the last of her drink?</strong> </p> <p>Well, funny you should ask. I was discussing just this point from the depths of a v.modern sofa in the basement of $, a martini lounge conveniently located a stone's throw from my office, only last week. (There I am, look, lounging with intent to drink martinis.) Anyway, Georgina, one of Cocktail Girl's favourite drinking partners, was horrified to clock me hurling the last dregs of $'s signature vodka martini (served 'James Bond style') down my throat with some force. </p> <p><strong> Good then, was it?</strong> </p> <p>It was. Anyway, she placed a restraining hand on my cocktail arm, explaining that it was thoroughly unacceptable for a lady to be seen straining towards her upturned glass, and that it would certainly prevent me from marrying well. It was the first I'd heard of that particular bit of cocktail etiquette, so I was fascinated to know more. </p> <p><strong> Did she enlighten you?</strong> </p> <p>Not at all. She just said it was not the behaviour of a lady. </p> <p><strong> So, basically, ladies aren't supposed to be too obvious about knocking back hard liquor in public?</strong> </p> <p>A straw poll of $ customers (an entertaining and shouty mix of off-duty hacks in bad suits, hairdressers from the cool and edgy salons of nearby Exmouth Market and city boys who'd stumbled downstairs after eating in the ground-floor diner) concluded that this was the general thrust of the never-finishing-your-drink rule, yes. There was some secondary debate, in $'s mildly disturbing unisex loos, about whether repeatedly throwing your neck backwards in the name of finishing a drink is bad for a girl's posture. </p> <p><strong> Did the bar staff help to throw any light on the matter?</strong> </p> <p>No, although Cocktail Girl was pleased to note that they circumnavigate the issue by serving the hugest glasses of wine ever, in what looks like big old brandy bowls. </p> <p><strong> Not skimping on the portions, then?</strong> </p> <p>Not so's you'd notice. Anyway, an entire debate on cocktail etiquette ensued, and raged on into the early hours ($ has a 1am licence, rather delightfully). We discussed issues like what to do with paper parasols, swizzle sticks shaped like flamingos, sparklers and other cocktail paraphernalia while you drink your drink. </p> <p><strong> So, what do you do?</strong> </p> <p>Nothing at all. If a drink has that sort of nonsense in it, you shouldn't have ordered it in the first place. </p> <p><strong> Anything else?</strong> </p> <p>A martini glass (like a wine glass) has a stem for a reason: you should hold it by that, and not risk warming your cocktail by grabbing the glass itself. Over-complex cocktails are pass\u00e9; the classics are having a revival. Shots are for hen parties. </p> <p><strong> I've got one: is it ever acceptable to lie down on sofas in bars?</strong> </p> <p>Not unless you're me, it's not.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jools Oliver, ex-model, mother and wife of Jamie</strong> <br> Interview by Nicki Sprinz</p> <p>'On a sunny day, sitting here at the Brew House Cafe is like being in the middle of the countryside; the views are really amazing and you never feel as though you're in central London. The cafe sells great ice creams and home-made cakes - they're delicious. It can be difficult to feed the girls in restaurants when I'm by myself, but I'm comfortable here. I love to take the girls out every afternoon and here they can run around and enjoy the sunshine. Poppy and Daisy really enjoy the novelty of eating outside, plus it means I don't have to do any clearing up after them. </p> <p>I enjoy cooking now, but the truth is I used to hate it. Food only became important when I moved in with Jamie. I used to come back from a day's modelling and eat supermarket ready-meals. Naturally, I've picked up a few skills from living with him. During the week I'm home every night while Jamie works at the restaurant. That's when I dabble in the kitchen - without him there looking over my shoulder. </p> <p>At the weekends it's a real treat because Jamie does all the cooking - the kids' meals get more exotic, he experiments with new recipes and ideas and I stay out of the kitchen. </p> <p>Jamie and I always really like the idea of going out to eat, but when it comes to the crunch we mostly stay in and watch a DVD. If we do go out we like to go to Nobu [on Park Lane, London W1] - no one bothers us there. </p> <p>It is when we go food shopping that people tend to stare. In the supermarket they seem interested in what we are buying - although I think they're probably more interested in Jamie's purchases than mine!' </p> <p> <strong> The Brew House</strong> <br>Kenwood House <br>Hampstead Lane <br>London NW3 <br>020 8341 5384 </p> <p> <strong>Alek Wek, model</strong> <br>Interview by Zoe Smith</p> <p>'There's nothing better than sitting outside on the deck at La Bottega on a hot summer's day surrounded by magnolia trees and white lanterns. The range of people who go there is just so diverse and the range of food on offer is a real treat. It's the perfect place to pop in to after work. </p> <p>My favourite dish is grilled tuna with steamed spinach on the side. I usually have it with a salad. I always try to make sure that whatever I eat is balanced as I like to have my greens and my protein. </p> <p>It's a really casual place to dine. You have views of Chelsea so one of the nice things about eating there is that you're not just stuck in some restaurant; you actually have a sense of where you are. I don't really buy into the whole hype that surrounds many of the restaurants in New York but I do enjoy the sort of places where the people are pleasant and the food is great. I can't understand why people go to a restaurant and sit there tossing and turning to see who else is dining there. Me? If I'm hungry and I go to a restaurant I want to sit down and eat. Some people get all dolled up and that's fine but I rarely feel like dressing up. As long as I'm clean, it's all good. </p> <p>I don't really worry too much about what I eat but I can't just stuff my face with any kind of food. I think that's good in a way because, even though it sounds corny, what you eat is what you are. Breakfast is a must for me and lunch, too, because I run around all day and need something in my belly. </p> <p>I love La Bottega but I don't go there too often because cooking is one of my passions. I pick up culinary influences from all the places I've travelled to but what I always crave is the sort of food that I used to hate when I was young. When I'm at home I like to prepare things like ochre stew with onions and fish, chicken or beef. My mum always sends my dried ochre in the post so I never run out of the stuff. </p> <p>Stews feature a lot in Sudanese food and they're often eaten with rice or brown bread or kisra which is similar to a pancake, but much lighter. My mum does the most amazing cabbage stew that she steams, simmers and tosses. It's delicious. Unfortunately there aren't any Sudanese restaurants in New York but my friends don't mind because they can always order original Sudanese food at my place. </p> <p>When I'm away from New York I miss the fact that you can eat at times when in other cities everything is closed. Sometimes in London, I think that I can eat when I finish working late, only to find that everything is closed. But it's never a catastrophe because I can always pop round to my mum's for some good food.' </p> <p> <strong> La Bottega</strong> <br>The Maritime Hotel <br>363 West 16th Street <br>New York NY10011 <br>001 212 242 4300 <br><a href=\"http://www.themaritimehotel.com\">www.themaritimehotel.com</a></p> <p><strong>Mourad Mazouz, restaurateur</strong> <br>Interview by Rebecca Seal</p> <p>'In Paris there are a few little bistros that I really love - and this is my favourite. Ramulaud serves traditional French food and is run by a great big guy with a huge moustache who also happens to be an ex-communist. He's arrogant in that very hilarious Parisian way. He and his waiters have all been there for years and it doesn't take long to be treated like a local. </p> <p>Now when I go I don't order from the menu; I just sit down and they bring me things to try. The staff are quite firm though - if they think you're ordering the wrong wine for the food they say so. </p> <p>Once I arrived on my moped for lunch but there were no vacant tables. So I just wheeled the bike in between two tables, sat on it and waited. The waiter came, took my order, and brought me a delicious lunch. I ate it balancing on the bike. </p> <p>I miss places like it when I'm in London. I miss the neighbourliness of Paris. I love sitting outside a bistro watching the world pass, close to the other tables, listening to the other people talk, the regulars, the old drunk guy mumbling on his own, the people who come in every day. I haven't found that in London. </p> <p>There was another little bistro in Paris that I loved very much when I lived there but it closed down a few years ago. The couple who ran it were in their seventies - they had had the restaurant for nearly 50 years. But every night they would have a huge fight, throw plates of food on the floor, scream about how much one had ruined the other's life, right in the middle of the restaurant. And the next night they would be there again, quietly serving food until one of them made a mistake and then the show would start all over again. </p> <p>I try and go to Paris as much as possible. When I really want to forget about my work in London [Mourad runs the restaurants Momo and Sketch] I check in to a little hotel and head for Ramulaud.' </p> <p> <strong> Le Ramulaud</strong> <br>269, rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine <br>75011 Paris <br>00 33 1 43 72 23 29 </p> <p><strong>Thandie Newton, actress</strong> <br> Interview by Chloe Diski</p> <p>'I just love this place. When I first came here six years ago, I didn't get a feel for the atmosphere because it was at night. The River Cafe is still magical in the evening because you can see lights over the Thames, but it's in the day when the sun is out that you really appreciate where it is. I love sitting by this particular stretch of the river Thames, surrounded by great architecture and it's incredibly peaceful. </p> <p>I first met Ruth Rogers [co-owner of the restaurant] at my friend [the artist]Sam Taylor-Wood's house. I remember Sam saying to me, 'Oh God, Ruth is coming and I'm really nervous because I've got to cook for her.' That evening I had this really bizarre moment when I just found myself giving Ruthie a hug. I was shocked at myself and said, 'Oh my God. I'm so sorry.' I knew what I was doing (I don't drink), but it was such an unconscious act. Ruthie has that incredible aura. </p> <p>It is a great place to take children: the staff offer food straight away if they see you have a kid and they don't mind if they play on the lawn in front - in fact, they encourage it by putting a couple of Spacehoppers out for them to bounce on. </p> <p>The second time I came here, I had the chocolate nemesis and that was it - I was hooked. The River Cafe serves seasonal food but thank God chocolate doesn't have a season. At the moment my favourite dish is sea bass with cherry tomatoes and anchovies - it is unbelievable. I love the bruschetta with Cornish crab, too (I'm from Cornwall so it reminds me of home). </p> <p>Often when I go out to eat, I sometimes feel that the chef is just trying to show off. Here they seem to want to celebrate the food, not themselves. Here they uncover the food. It's naked. It's what real Italian food is all about.' </p> <p> <strong> The River Cafe</strong> <br>Thames Wharf, <br>Rainville Road, London <br>020 7386 4200 </p> <p><strong>Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, interior designer</strong> <br> Interview by Rebecca Seal</p> <p>'I am a creature of habit so I always have tuna tartare and then seared fillet of beef when I come here, although the rest of the menu is lovely. I only drink vodka with lunch - wine gives me a hangover. I might sometimes have frogs' legs and a little foie gras starter. Youcef, the new chef, does little amuses bouches too - today we had a little roast breast of quail and scallops. I'm a big protein fan, sort of a reformed Atkinser - which is such a boy's diet after all. I like food that is recognisably meat. Like an ear. Or offal. I'm fighting the onset of a 40-year-old's rotundity, especially since giving up smoking at Christmas. The upsetting thing is that, since stopping, I haven't eaten more, I just seem to absorb every last calorie. </p> <p>My friend Frank and I have lunch here at least once a week - my offices are just round the corner. My wife Jackie came with us last week, which is quite rare, since Frank and I have a tendency either to sit around discussing the exact stipple technique William Hogarth used in the 1720s or fart jokes. I think she was a bit shocked. It's wonderful to have lunch in the sun now that they have this garden. It is in huge contrast to the inside, which is really quite dark. If you think back 10 years, no restaurant had a garden and now everyone is dragging tables outside - which actually only makes sense if you're somewhere nice like this and not in Piccadilly Circus. </p> <p>The Spread Eagle is an old coaching inn and the garden is the old coach yard. It's always been a part of the real Greenwich - the old theatrical, randy, bawdy, sailor-infested Greenwich, which I find really rather horny and love the idea of bringing more of that back. The whole place is about the contrast of slum and splendour, even if now the slums are all furnished by Ikea and have Changing Rooms on the telly in the corner. </p> <p>I am emphatically not good at cooking, as Mrs Llewelyn-Bowen will testify. I am a phenomenally talented and really very enthusiastic pot-washer but I can't even make salad dressing properly. I can just about bring pasta to the boil, but there is a fair chance it will take on some strange and unthought-of consistency during the cooking process. We eat out a huge amount as a family and my kids aren't at all fussy; if they don't see anything on the menu they like, they won't moan and whinge to us, but will quietly ask the waiter if they could just have some pasta. I think that shows that if the worst should happen, they would be able to survive, especially in Knightsbridge.' </p> <p><strong>The Spread Eagle Restaurant </strong> <br>1 &amp; 2 Stockwell St <br>Greenwich , London SE10 9JB <br>020 8853 2333 </p> <p> <strong>Alberta Ferretti, fashion designer</strong> <br> Interview by Allegra Donn</p> <p>'The wonderful thing about Italy is that you don't have to travel far to taste different types of food. This is because Italian cuisine is very much based on local produce; if you're by the sea, it'll be fish, if you're inland, it'll be more meat-based. It is as simple as that. </p> <p>The Vicolo Santa Lucia offers a traditional type of cooking from the area - it is on the Adriatic coast near Rimini - with an oriental twist. </p> <p>I was born in Cattolica and my clothes factory is nearby, so I am here at least two days a week. For me it is a little haven, away from the noisy crowds of the Adriatic coast. </p> <p>If I want something light I have the freshly grilled tuna with vegetables. If I really feel like something special, I'll order the \u00ebmezze maniche [literally: short sleeved pasta] or the sea bass with olives and potatoes. The sushi and sashimi are also delicious and if I have pudding it'll usually be the plate of different ice creams mixed with fruits and caramel. </p> <p>At lunchtime I don't touch alcohol, but in the evening I always have a glass of white wine. My favourite is from a producer in Friulli called Josko Gravner, which is quite hard to come by. The owner produces it in small quantities and he matures it in earthenware containers rather than in wooden barrels as most vineyards do today. </p> <p>The setting of the restaurant is wonderful - it is by the swimming pool and beyond that is the sea.' </p> <p><strong> Vicolo Santa Lucia</strong> <br>Carducci 76 <br>Viale Carducci 76 <br>47841 Cattolica <br>Italy <br>00 39 0541 954677 </p> <p><strong>Beach shacks to restaurants - great alfresco eating places in Britain </strong> <br>Compiled by Sue Webster and Viola Fort</p> <p> <strong> Baywatch Beach Restaurant</strong> </p> <p> The Waterfront, St Helens, Isle of Wight </p> <p>01983 873259; <a href=\"http://www.bay-watch.co.uk\">www.bay-watch.co.uk</a> </p> <p>'Pretty posh', but a beach cafe nonetheless during the day, Baywatch morphs into a restaurant at night - with 12 large tables outside.

  "<p>History does not record when Sir Crispin Davis last visited the dentist, but it's safe to assume that he found it a more pleasurable experience than being interviewed by a journalist. The chief executive of international publishing behemoth Reed Elsevier does not enjoy the attention that running a FTSE 100 company brings. </p> <p>'I love the job. I think to be chief executive of one of the leading FTSE companies is a huge privilege and I think I'm very lucky, but I hate all the personal publicity,' he concedes. 'It's part of the job, part of the territory. Some of it is unavoidable, because you're trying to get the Reed Elsevier story across.' </p> <p>That story makes far better reading than it did when Davis arrived five years ago, ending Reed's year-long search for a new chief executive. By that time, Reed had already shed its colourful past as publisher of the Daily Mirror and owner of IPC, then the UK's largest consumer magazine group, to concentrate on the dull but profitable business of academic publishing. </p> <p>But the company structure created by the 1993 merger of Reed International and Dutch scientific publisher Elsevier - two boards, two chairmen and two chief executives - gave it a schizophrenic corporate culture. Davis tackled that quickly, placing himself in sole charge of a single board. </p> <p>Could the oil giant Shell, which still has a similar structure, learn any lessons from this?</p> <p>'Well, the solution was not honestly that difficult. Every board member who did not see and share the same vision of one unified company left,' Davis says. Managing by consent is clearly not really his style. </p> <p>Davis then set about articulating a clear corporate strategy in a characteristically matter-of-fact manner. Reed was reorganised into three clearly defined divisions - science and medical, business, and legal - and Davis added a fourth, education, through the \u00a33.1 billion acquisition of US-based Harcourt General in 2001. </p> <p>Finally, he set about sweating those assets, applying the branding acumen he acquired at Procter and Gamble to improve the marketing of its products. </p> <p>Anyone who can turn what one industry source calls 'a basket case' into a group described approvingly as 'a publishing juggernaut' by a media analyst last week is sure to win the support of the City. Davis has a sizeable fan club in the Square Mile thanks to his uncanny ability to turn in above-average profits growth, year in, year out, despite the prolonged global economic downturn. </p> <p>That trend continued last week when Davis announced underlying interim pre-tax profits of \u00a3433 million, a 5 per cent increase. It is little wonder he has become a fully fledged member of the City establishment, bagging a knighthood in the Queen's birthday honours list this year and acquiring the compulsory heavyweight non-executive positions (GlaxoSmithKline and a place on the board of Tate Modern). </p> <p>Reed's annual profit growth even won Davis the moniker 'Mr 10 Per Cent', an echo of the 'Mr 20 Per Cent' nickname ascribed to Sir Clive Thompson when he pulled off a similar feat at Rentokil. </p> <p>'Oh, God. Do me a favour, leave that out,' Davis says, no doubt aware of the fate Thompson met when his profits finally fell. 'What I am trying to do is deliver consistent above-line performance, and I think in the last five years we've delivered pretty successfully. Our goal over the next five years is to do the same - whether that is 7 per cent or 17 per cent depends on the market.' Crucially, Davis has achieved all this by shifting a huge proportion of Reed's content online, despite the huge investment this has required (close to \u00a3900m over three years). </p> <p>'The City has understood and supported the investment programme and the long-term nature of it. I hope it's encouraged by the results it's deliverdigital ing,' says Davis, with just a hint of satisfaction in his voice. </p> <p>Many publishers were slow to embrace the internet, partly because they doubted consumers would put down their newspapers and magazines just because they could access the same information from laptops. But the products Reed provides - scientific journals, books for schools and trade magazines - are better suited to the electronic age. </p> <p>Even so, the move online has shaken the sleepy world of business publishing to its core. 'Five or 10 years ago you produced a book, then you produced a revised edition the year after that. It was the same with journals,' Davis says. 'But deliverdigital technology and the move to online marketing and products is really making this market dynamic. That is one of the key factors that will drive our growth going forward.' </p> <p>In 2000 Reed's total online revenues were \u00a3120m. This year they will be \u00a31.2bn, a tenfold increase. How long before everything moves online? Twenty years, perhaps? </p> <p>'It may be sooner. Today about 75 per cent of our scientific business is online. Five or six years ago is was 5 per cent.' The proportions are similar in Reed's legal business, where nearly 70 per cent of content is available online. </p> <p>Reed's business-to-business arm, which publishes trade journals including Estates Gazette, Variety and New Scientist, has been slower to move online, but even here 15 per cent of revenues are now generated via the internet. 'Our internet revenues have gone from nothing to \u00a3200m in four years in business-to-business and they're growing at about 30 per cent a year.' </p> <p>The internet represents a threat as well as an opportunity, however. A whopping 25 per cent of Reeds' profits come from scientific publishing (its medical journals include The Lancet), but its business model is under threat from 'open access' providers, who make the same research freely available online. </p> <p>Subscribers pay thousand of pounds a year to subscribe to one of Reed's journals. Under the open access model, they pay nothing at all. The cost is borne by the scientists, who publish their work for nothing in Reed's journals, but pay a small fee for doing so under the open access. </p> <p>Open access has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for some commentators, who argue that scientists in developing countries can't afford to pay Reed's prices. Davis was hauled before the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee earlier this year to explain his pricing policy, an experience he probably didn't relish. </p> <p>'I think the process enabled us to put our views across, to make our views very clear,' he says diplomatically. Still, it is difficult to imagine Davis being savaged by a left-wing Labour MP, who effectively accused him of profiteering, and feeling sanguine about it. 'I think I better keep my mouth shut,' says Davis. You sense that if he could keep his mouth shut all the time, he would be a far happier chief executive. </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name </strong> Sir Crispin Henry Lamert Davis </p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 55 </p> <p><strong> Nationality </strong> British </p> <p><strong> Family </strong> Married, three daughters </p> <p><strong> Lives </strong> Sunningdale, Berkshire </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> Charterhouse; Oriel College, Oxford, MA in Modern History </p> <p><strong> Career </strong> September 1999-present: chief executive Reed Elsevier. 1994-1999: chief executive, Aegis Group. 1970-1994: various management positions at Procter &amp; Gamble</p> <p><strong> Interests </strong> sport, gardening, art, antique furniture </p> <p><strong>What they say</strong></p> <p>'It will be interesting to see whether the economic model he's committed to in scientific publishing is still viable'<br> <strong> Media executive</strong> </p> <p>'I've worked for him for years and I still like working for him - and I can't say that about my previous bosses' <br><strong> Colleague</strong> </p> <p>'He's turned Reed from a basket case into a word-class business' <strong> City source</strong></p>",
  "<p>After seven years at the Treasury, I find it hard to resist the temptation to reminisce. And last Thursday's rate rise took me straight back to that day, in May 1997, when Gordon Brown announced that he was granting the Bank of England operational independence to set interest rates. </p> <p>I will never forget the slightly surreal sight of a Labour Chancellor calling past Chancellors - Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke (we inadvertently forgot John Major) - to inform them of his decision. Or the look of ill-concealed horror that flashed across William Keegan's face at the morning press conference when he realised what was happening. </p> <p>My favourite moment came when a journalist (luckily I've forgotten who) asked Brown if he expected to have to raise interest rates again next month. He had clearly missed the significance of the announcement. </p> <p>Today there is near-universal support for independence. Back then it was seen as a rather risky step. Many eminent columnists were understandably sceptical, given the Bank's history. And, of course, the Conservative party opposed the change. </p> <p>That day changed British economic policy in some unexpected ways. As Keegan writes in The Prudence of Mr Gordon Brown, Bank independence removed at a stroke one of the main sources of tension between Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street which caused Clarke and Lawson so much grief. </p> <p>And far from weakening the ability of the Treasury to ensure public spending discipline, the risk that the monetary policy committee (MPC) might respond with a rate rise has proved a useful and effective deterrent to profligate departmental proposals on more than occasion. Fiscal policy has supported monetary policy throughout this economic cycle - far more than in previous decades. </p> <p>At the same time, Bank independence has freed Brown to spend much of his time pursuing the goals this Labour government was elected to deliver - full employment, a reduction in child and pensioner poverty, reform of and investment in public services, tackling global injustice. </p> <p>Yet it has been the MPC's deliberately forward-looking and pre-emptive approach to setting interest rates that, I believe, explains why central bank independence has been an economic policy success since 1997. </p> <p>The MPC's first big test came in the autumn of 1998, when the Asian and Russian financial crises, followed by the LTCM Wall Street hedge fund scare, sent world financial markets into a tailspin. The Bank responded by cutting interest rates month after month to prevent a British slowdown and sustain growth. </p> <p>Just to prove that this was not a one-off, the MPC again cut interest rates - nine times - following the US slowdown in 2000 and the collapse in global trade growth. While the US, Japan, Germany and France all suffered recessions, Britain continued to grow, with employment rising and consumer confidence robust. </p> <p>Why was the MPC able to act in such a decisive manner? Part of the reason was that the Chancellor set the Bank an explicit inflation target of 2.5 per cent: inflation below the target is as much to be avoided as inflation above target. This has removed for Britain the deflationary bias that has characterised some other independent central banks. </p> <p>The other key ingredient is the flexibility and discretion that the constraint of operational independence has allowed. As Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott wrote in a powerful column last week about trust in economics and politics: 'Voters no longer assume ... the government will play politics with interest rates and screw up the economy.' </p> <p>This is a rather more subtle point than would first appear. There is no doubt that, pre-1997, there was a tendency to play politics with interest rates, evidenced by the fact that they were often cut on Budget day or the day after. But the case for independence is not simply that it stops venal policymakers from deliberately manipulating interest rates to fit an electoral timetable. </p> <p>Imagine if in 1998 a Chancellor had tried to take a similarly forward-looking and pre-emptive approach to setting interest rates and embarked - rightly - on a series of consecutive monthly rate cuts. After the second cut, the political process would be shouting 'panic' and the old 1970s newsreels dusted off. By the time of the third cut, a full-scale political crisis - and probably a sterling crisis, too - would have been under way. </p> <p>No wonder that, pre-1997, the temptation for Chancellors and Bank governors was not to be forward-looking and pre-emptive but to wait and see, in the hope that something would turn up. Yet it was this inflexibility and delay that led repeatedly to sharper rises in interest rates to try to bring inflation back under control and then deeper rate cuts - too late - as the economy slipped into recession. </p> <p>Since 1997, with interest rate decisions to meet the politically determined inflation target now in the hands of a group of technical experts, regular pre-emptive rate cuts have twice proved not destabilising but stabilising. And while in 1998 the Conservative shadow chancellor predicted 'a recession made in Downing Street' he soon had to eat his words - as did the leader of the opposition and the shadow chancellor when growth came in on target last year. </p> <p>Which brings me to last Thursday's interest rate decision. It is the MPC's determination to avoid repetition of past mistakes that explains why, as the global economy has strengthened over then past year and US interest rates have risen, the Bank has also embarked on a series of five small pre-emptive increases in UK interest rates to keep the economy growing at a sustainable pace. And while vigilant about the risks, it is because of the MPC's pre-emptive approach that the necessary moderation in house-price inflation seems now to be happening. </p> <p>Far from these modest rate rises denting public support for the government's economic policy, the CBI and Engineering Employers' Federation have actually advocated modest and pre-emptive increases in interest rates to keep the economy stable and growing - and avoid a return to the double-digit interest rates of the past. </p> <p>As rising employment remains consistent with moderate growth in average earnings, there is scope for economic growth to be above the rate of inflation next year. </p> <p>But it is premature to declare that politics has been taken out of the interest rate debate. Because the Conservative party once again responded by predicting doom for Britain and, rather oddly, blamed rising public spending for last week's rate rise. </p> <p>It is easy to see why the Tories are so desperate to re-politicise UK monetary policy. With public trust in both the MPC and UK economic policy rebuilt after the failures of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Shadow Chancellor needs to dent that trust if he can. </p> <p>But on economic matters the memories of the British public are long and vivid. To images of 1970s strikes and the winter of discon tent have now been added sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, double-digit interest rates and the poll tax. </p> <p>Trust in economic policy, once shattered, is hard to rebuild. So given the choice of Brown and the MPC running the economy or Michael Howard and Oliver Letwin, I can hazard a guess as to whom most people would choose. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ed Balls is the prospective parliamentary candidate for Normanton and former chief economic adviser to the Treasury </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan is on holiday</p>",
  "<p><strong>Ex-Sun editor also falls</strong><br> </p> <p>Ex-Sun editor David Yelland may now be a PR heavyweight, but when it comes to drinking he remains something of a lightweight. Last week, at a leaving bash for Sun reporters made redundant following the closure of the paper's Manchester office, a tired and emotional Yelland fell down one flight of stairs, and lurched towards a second after being dusted down by former employees. Then, when they carried him to the hotel where he claimed to be staying, there was no booking in his name. Clearly inebriated former tabloid editors aren't welcome at the Manchester Malmaison. </p> <p><strong>Gone fishing</strong><br> </p> <p>Silly season watch, week two. It's a hot, humid day at Canary Wharf. News is thin on the ground. Telegraph executives pace the newsroom floor, nervously chewing their nails. There's a huge hole on page five and it's already teatime. But all is not lost. The paper's environment editor concocts a world-beating scoop on Britain's endangered fish - and the art department is ordered to knock up an illustration to accompany it. It may look like it's been lifted straight from the Encyclopedia Britannica, but at least it fills a page. </p> <p><strong>You've been cad</strong><br> </p> <p>The press pack trailing Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's former squeeze Faria Alam on her way to meet Max Clifford last week spotted a familiar figure opposite the PR guru's West London offices. As the former FA secretary hammered out the terms of a \u00a3500,000 deal with two newspapers and a TV company, James Hewitt could be spied in a cafe over the road. We assume he was in the area in the hope of negotiating a similar deal, although we venture to suggest that it may not be quite as lucrative. </p> <p><strong>Sven signs off</strong><br> </p> <p>The same press pack last week followed Eriksson onto a plane from his Swedish holiday home to Amsterdam. He was predictably bad-tempered when challenged by reporters but agreed to sign his autograph for a Sun journalist posing as a passenger. When unfurled, it proved to be a mock resignation letter. Expect it on Ebay soon.</p>",
  "<p>'You have such beautiful skies,' Woody Allen said last week at the completion of another scene in another film, 'when they're overcast.' Allen and his crew had been looking up at the skies above West Kensington all morning, hoping for cloud. They were at Queen's Club, surrounded by the lush tennis courts and white-cottoned members trying not to appear too interested as a small 68-year-old man in a frayed green baseball cap moved among them. 'I never shoot in the sun if I can help it because everything looks much better without it,' the director continued. 'The sun has been the bane of my existence.' </p> <p>Allen's crew wear laminated passes bearing the letters WASP 04 - the Woody Allen Summer Project, the 36th such project in his career. They have filmed in Belgravia and the Fulham Road, in St James's Park and Tate Modern, and everywhere they've been people are thrilled to see them. Passers-by ring up friends on their mobiles: Woody Allen filming in our street! Scarlett Johansson looking beautiful! Woody much smaller in real life! 'Occasionally people ask me for autographs and I give them,' the recipient of this adulation says. 'People are so nice to me. If only everyone who is so keen to see me would go to see my movies!' </p> <p>WASP 04 is still a mystery, even to those on set. Allen will only say who's in it (Johansson, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode) and what it's vaguely about, which turns out to be the same as almost all his other movies - human relationships and their consequences. In his famous style, the actors only get to see their own scenes, and the producers even less. As the only person who knows quite what film he is trying to make, Allen says he is happy with progress, 'but I hope it's not just that the English voices are so beautiful to my ear that they cover a multitude of my sins.' </p> <p>He fears that the same speeches read by an American cast would be pedestrian. 'To hear Jonathan Rhys-Meyers do them or Brian Cox or Penelope Wilton - they sound like what we've grown up in America to consider as acting and theatre at its highest. And Scarlett is of course just a natural great actress. She can do no wrong, incapable of a bad moment. Very sexy, very pretty. She was just touched by God.' </p> <p>We talk while the sun is out - 10 minutes here, 15 there - on a sequence of benches, director's chairs and catering buses. Allen walks slowly between each spot, and speaks gently and with great conviction. When he is filming, he occasionally crouches down to peer through a lens, but otherwise watches over the cameraman's shoulder with the day's script tightly rolled in his hand, as if he is about to swat flies. He does not bellow 'And... action !' at any point; the working day progresses organically, merging from set-up to camera-roll in smooth order, with hushed conversations among his technicians between scenes. On this day in West London, precisely halfway through a seven-week schedule, it is as if nothing is riding on the film at all. </p> <p>If only this were so. The paying public and large parts of the film business have fallen out of love with Woody Allen's art, if not his person. With each new film they see a diminishing of talents. Allen peps up his work with the leading young actors of the day, and he injects the usual one-liners and angsty philosophies, but he is regularly regarded as a lost cause, a man who has spent the last decade grimly failing to reproduce the great achievements of his career - Annie Hall, Manhattan, Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Husbands and Wives - some of which defined an era, some of which just defined the best imaginable way to spend a Saturday night. </p> <p>It's not that Small Time Crooks or Sweet and Lowdown or Mighty Aphrodite are bad films - how much more entertaining they are than most teen and disaster movies - it's just that they don't fill us with the joy that they used to, and we don't tend to quote from them. Every year a hopeful critic jumps out from the page to proclaim The Curse of the Jade Scorpion or Hollywood Ending 'a magnificent return to form', but theirs is a minority voice. It may be his age, it may be exhaustion, it may be the lack of someone around him to say, 'Whoa, one movie every two years is enough for anyone!' Or it may be that he no longer has the power to grasp and ridicule the concerns of our times. But what if most people are wrong? What if his best work is still to come? </p> <p>I have met Allen twice before, but have never seen him with such an assured outlook on life. He says he loves being in London, his wife and two children are either out at the sights or in the pool of his rented house, and he is serious when he says that he finds the on-set catering to be better than in New York. His own opinion of his current standing in the film world is instructive. </p> <p>'In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now,' he says. 'There was a time in the 1950s when I wanted to be a playwright, because until that time movies, which mostly came out of Hollywood, were stupid and not interesting. Then we started to get wonderful European films, and American films started to grow up a little bit, and the industry became more fun to work in than the theatre. I loved it. But now it's taken a turn in the other direction and studios are back in command and are not that interested in pictures that make only a little bit of money. When I was younger, every week we'd get a Fellini or a Bergman or a Godard or Truffaut, but now you almost never get any of that. Filmmakers like myself have a hard time. The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films - if they get a good film they're twice as happy, but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500m. </p> <p>'That's why I'm happy to work in London, because I'm right back in the same kind of liberal creative attitude that I'm used to.' </p> <p>I wonder if there was a time recently when he found the situation he describes too painful to endure? 'Yes. In the last couple of years I've thought about if I do really want to function in the film business the way I did when I started. When I started, there was a great joy in wanting to make a film and knowing there was a huge audience out there - not huge, but a special audience, and I would try to appeal to that audience if I could. </p> <p>'You felt part of something. Now, you know, I don't really care that much. There's no real prestigious film industry, there's no real cultivated film industry. All new young directors are smitten by what they see, and they are smitten by special effects and blockbusters and they all want to make those kind of pictures. OK, not all - 98 per cent. Maybe if I can get a situation in the United States where someone will work the way I want to work I'll do it. If not, I'll make another film in Europe... or I'll work in the theatre.' </p> <p>In October he will direct his own play, Second-Hand Memory in New York. 'It doesn't have to be films,' he says of his future career. 'There's no film community I really care to be a part of.' </p> <p>For the time being he perseveres, often to the consternation of his greatest fans. Why does he work so hard? 'Why not?' he replies with some bewilderment. 'What does one do in the world? I read books, listen to music, I watch sports, and there's plenty of time to work. What else would I do? When my grandmother was old she used to just sit by the window all day and look out at people. That seems to me boring. Life is a meaningless grind, so... you know... One film a year really isn't a big deal. There's plenty of time to do all this stuff, and plenty of time for my family and to go to the basketball game and take walks and go to dinner every night. Tonight I'll go see the dailies, yesterday's work, and hopefully it will be good. I'll go home, play with the kids, my wife and I will go out to a nice restaurant for dinner, go to sleep...' </p> <p>Allen says he has all but given up on his ambitions to make a masterpiece, something that may be ranked against Kurosawa and his dead European idols. 'I've resigned myself,' he says. 'I'm functioning within the parameters of my mediocrity.' He maintains that he never sees any of his films after they leave the editing room, and that he remains vaguely unhappy with all of them; they never turn out the way he had hoped when he first sketched out his ideas in his bedroom. Surely not Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters ? </p> <p>'You know, I tried to buy Manhattan back, because I was disappointed with it and I wished I could get them not to release it and I'd do a free film for them, which is what I offered them. But other people loved it, so I can't really tell myself.' </p> <p>We walk towards some lunch. I tell him there is lamb today, and swordfish steaks. He says he may go for something more spartan. As he constructs a tiny mixed salad in a polystyrene bowl I wonder if he is glad that Manhattan appeared after all. 'Yes, because it was such a big success. I always think with films like that that I got away with something. I think, \"It's interesting, they really don't see what the problem is...\"' </p> <p>Allen says he feels the same when people pay to hear him play New Orleans jazz on his clarinet. Last weekend he travelled with his band to perform three concerts in Germany, and this weekend he's in Spain and Monaco for a Red Cross gala in the presence of Prince Albert. 'I have improved, but I've improved within the parameters of no talent. I don't say this with false modesty. I'm a strict amateur, with no ear, but people come to see me because I'm a celebrity from the movies. I would starve to death in a week if I had to do it without being a celebrity. I go into these 2,000- or 3,000-seat venues and I sell them out. Jazz musicians who are truly miraculous go in and don't have anything near that kind of thing, so obviously it's got nothing to do with the quality of my playing.' </p> <p>He fears that his fame may also work against him. 'I tried to write a novel,' he says. 'And I finished it. But I didn't want to have a novel out there that would be regarded as the work of a celebrity. I didn't want it looked down upon or embraced because it had a celebrity name. I wanted to write a novel that could hold its own with professional novels, and I didn't think that this could, so I have it in my drawer. I just didn't think it was good enough.' </p> <p>His assistant joins us at the back of the catering bus, asking whether it's OK if a driver can bring someone to the set. 'That is OK,' Allen says, 'but I need something more to eat.' He holds up his bowl. 'These turned out to be cucumbers but I thought they were something else. Can I get a piece of bread, a nice dry piece of brown bread, a few more tomatoes?' </p> <p>'A candy bar?' his assistant asks. </p> <p>'No, I don't want a candy bar. If there's anything else in the vegetable family...' </p> <p>I wondered about the title for his London film. He said that when he writes in his bedroom he too refers to his new movie as the Woody Allen Spring / Summer / Fall Project. 'It's never that I'm hiding the titles. When I have them, I always give them out. But when a film is over then I want to see what title feels best, and what title best leads the audience to that material. I've had all the people working for me trying to think of titles. Sometimes it comes right to the wire and we panic.' On one film he came up with the title Anhedonia. 'They thought it was too obscure a word; it means the inability to experience pleasure. People said, it's a lovely movie, but if they see the title Anhedonia they won't be interested at all. So finally, not even two weeks before we were ready to make the ads we thought, OK: Annie Hall.' </p> <p>The appearance of one Woody Allen title each year has remained the only constant in a decade of flux. The last 10 years have been one of dramatic personal and professional upheaval for Allen: he split from his partner Mia Farrow and married her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. They adopted two children. Both his parents died. He endured a painful legal battle with his long-time producer Jean Doumanian. He even changed his jazz musicians. </p> <p>He talks of these events with protective nonchalance, but once there was a period when his career, or at least his reputation, seemed over, those months when Mia Farrow accused him of child neglect and people assumed he was sleeping with his daughter. One thing was clear even before the courts ruled on custody: Woody could never really play Woody again. </p> <p>'I never give it any thought,' he claims. 'It never meant anything to me. I just function, and the tabloids do their work, and it never had any direct bearing on my life. It didn't make my pictures do better or worse. It didn't make me happy or unhappy. As a newspaper reader you could read about it every day, but there was nothing really happening. If you were in it, it was kind of boring. </p> <p>'I consider myself incredibly lucky,' he continues. 'I have an ideal marriage and great kids. My parents both died peacefully. I was disappointed that I had a falling-out with my former producer because she was a friend, but it's not a brain tumour - that's the worst thing that could happen to either one of us.' </p> <p>Several times during our meeting Allen mentioned how grateful he was to have his health, and he did look for wood to touch. His father lived beyond 100, his mother to her mid-nineties, so the great screen hypochondriac has genes on his side. 'My hearing is a little worse,' he says, 'and my eyesight is a little worse, but I'm in reasonably decent physical shape. But growing older you never like, because it's sadder, because you're getting closer to dying, and who wants that?' </p> <p>Last week Anything Else opened to the usual mixed reviews. It's an intriguing film, in which Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci take the roles Allen would once have written for himself. Allen plays a paranoid crank who may also be a visionary, a gag-writer who advises everyone to carry a rifle and water-purifying tablets and a torch that floats in water. It is a part that for once no one can mistake for autobiography: he drives a red Porsche and wants to move to LA. But it may be autobiographical in other ways. Anything Else is rather an optimistic picture, despite the apocalyptic jokes: the Jason Biggs character cleanses his life of pretence and disastrous relationships and moves on to some sort of contentment. I went to see it on the first Sunday evening following its release - and there were only about 30 others in the cinema. </p> <p>The real buzz is for his next film, completed not long before he arrived in London and already being lined up for the autumn film festivals. He describes Melinda and Melinda as both a dramatic and comic film, telling the same story from two perspectives. It features Will Ferrell, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Radha Mitchell, the latter replacing Winona Ryder at the eleventh hour and tipped by Allen for great things. In WASP 04, Scarlett Johansson replaced Kate Winslet shortly before shooting began, a switch that required the character to change nationality. 'It was not a problem,' Allen says. 'It took about an hour.' </p> <p>As we relocate for the fourth time I ask Allen what he enjoys most about filmmaking, and he says 'not the filming. I like the writing and the editing. When I get bored with writing, I can stop and finish the next day, and when I'm editing I have my own private room in New York, I have all my music, and it could be 95 degrees outside or zero, and I'm functioning.' </p> <p>What he likes most about filming is the improvement actors bring to his scripts. 'There is a lot of improvisation. I make up things all the time, and I encourage the actors to do the same. The first thing I tell the actors is \"Disregard the script - if you want to drop lines, change lines, improvise, lengthen or shorten something just do it and if you're getting anything wrong I'll tell you.\"' Brian Cox said recently that he found Allen a very fast director but the freedom Allen gave him was rather intimidating. 'Woody will say, \"You know, it would be nice if I could recognise some of my own words, but that's OK...\"' </p> <p>Ten years ago, when I first met him, I reminded Allen of something he'd once written: he'd said that if he could live his whole life again he'd do it just the same but he wouldn't read Beowulf. I wondered what he'd change in reality. He said he would have liked to have entered a more physical profession, perhaps ballet dancing. </p> <p>Ten years on, he says: 'It would be like having a re-shoot. Whenever I do a re-shoot for a scene the new scene is always better, and this would be the same with my life. I only wish I could do a re-shoot. I would rather that my talent had been a musical one. I would rather have been a great instrumentalist. Or when I did What's New Pussycat? in 1965, my first movie, in retrospect I regret not staying and living in Paris. Living in Paris was a very happy experience. I thought, \"What if I never go home? What if I stay in Paris, I love this city.\" I wonder in retrospect if I would have enjoyed that more... making films in France.' </p> <p>The sun was disappearing for him again; there was another career move to make. I asked him what he'd still like to achieve in his life. 'Besides death in sleep? I'd like to keep happy and play with the kids and be with my wife. I've never known great family life since I was an adult, but now I do and it's meaningful to me. I would like to keep healthy and make a great movie. I would love to be able to do that, but I don't think that's going to happen any more. If I keep working, I think it's possible that I could do a great movie some day by accident.'</p>",
  "<p>You have always been the most communicative of readers. Your mail arrives at my door by the sackful, couriered to my home with the weekly barrage of press releases, piles of review books and food samples. Now you have a working email address for me, you might actually get a reply within weeks rather than months. I'm sorry if some of your queries have disappeared into the ether. One day there were so many I had to phone the server to unblock my system. Of course, it wasn't only your questions that choked my Mac, but the usual mishmash of friends saying hello, PR drivel and the neverending offers of porn and other things I would rather not think about. If any of you failed to fill in the subject box, I'm afraid you got deleted. I have learnt the hard way not to open emails from women called Shelley. And while I reckon I am pretty sharp at spotting unwanted spam, one or two did get the better of me. How was I to know that an email labelled 'Have Some Cannelloni Tony' would turn out not to be one of your cookery questions, but an Italian gay porn film on DVD? </p> <p>I wish I had room to answer all your queries - sadly, I would need the entire magazine to myself. Instead I have picked the ones I feel will be of interest to as many people as possible. Really technical questions or pleas for recipes I have hedged. Oh, and thank you all for the advice about the squirrels and foxes and slugs that plague my kitchen garden, and for asking about the cats. They are fine, if getting a little elderly.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hello Nigel, I can't do puddings at all. I tried to make your very quick chocolate cake for a friend's birthday and that went wrong - I'd have been better off just bringing in the Valrhona for people to gorge on. What can I make that will be lovely and foolproof? Please help me - there are sometimes some evenings when only a pudding will do, and now I am scared of them. Hope your cats are OK. <br><strong>Love from Suzanne</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hi Suzanne, It's not you - it's the recipe. That Quick Chocolate Cake recipe is crap. It is one of those recipes (now about 12 years old) that will haunt me till the end of my days. I guess every cookery writer has one - the recipe we wish we had never done. Tear it out and have a go instead at the Chocolate Espresso Cake in my book Real Food (\u00a312.99, 4th Estate), the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake in Appetite (\u00a315, 4th Estate) or the brownies I did in this column a couple of weeks ago. </p> <p>But then, there is no real reason why you have to make a pudding yourself. The French and Italians are perfectly happy to go and buy that bit of the meal from the shops without apology. There is no shame in buying something in if it's good. The British have this strange idea that we must do everything ourselves. We don't. So if you can't make pudding, then don't. Make something else.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Why do you only give metric measurements for the recipes? It has infuriated me for years, and I have longed to demand why. It isn't just the inconvenience of my cake tins all being in inches, or the irrational nostalgia I have for still using my mother's old cream-enamel weighing scales from the Fifties, or even the fact that I can't instinctively cut 100g of butter like I can 2oz. I am a teacher, and the maths curriculum we have to teach to ages seven to 12 includes both the metric system and the imperial one. Children have to know how much a pint is and a yard, as well as a litre and metre.</p> <p>I know the government insists every butcher displays the kilo price, but everyone I stand next to is still asking for a pound of sausages and getting served without query.<br><strong> Yours, Ms G Bennett</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Oh, for heaven's sake. Did you make all this fuss when we changed to decimal currency? Do you still demand that shopkeepers tell you the price in pounds, shillings and pence? No, of course you don't. We are only talking about a new set of scales, Ms Bennett, not a sex change.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, I tend to use sherry vinegar the most in my cooking (having followed your advice), but when should I use all the other vinegars in my store cupboard? I've got balsamic, red, white and cider vinegar, plus lemon and lime juice. Hope you're still swimming (and eating ice cream).<br><strong> Alwyn Jackson, Rochdale</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Yes, Mr Jackson, I'm still eating ice cream. That is why I have to do all the swimming. There are so many wonderful vinegars about, from rich, mellow balsamic to light, fruity raspberry, and many in between. All are worth a try. I tend to sip them, then decide what will work best. It is worth remembering that in matters of taste there is no right and wrong, so if you want to put balsamic vinegar on your ice cream, then why not? Italians do.</p> <p>On a daily basis I use an Italian red-wine vinegar for most things - it is my knee-jerk vinegar - but I do use a white one from time to time. Much depends on how rich you want a salad dressing to be. Sherry vinegar is perfect with walnut oil and for wintry salads, and is just fabulous with mushrooms. (Try sprinkling on a little before you bake them.) I am very partial to a drop of French tarragon vinegar, especially if it is going to accompany chicken. Try adding a shake or two to the gravy for roast chicken, or a neat drizzle on freshly steamed runner beans. Cider vinegar is good in any salad containing nuts and is something I will happily use with oily fish such as mackerel. </p> <p>I sometimes add a dash to the gravy for a pork roast. It seems to bring the pan juices to life. Have you ever tried balsamic vinegar in home-made strawberry ice cream? Do - it adds a real depth.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I've been trying to make pesto with rocket, as I have masses of the stuff in my garden. It's a particularly peppery variety, and I wondered if you have any suggestions for adding something to make the end result less bitter. <strong>Regards, Damian</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Damian, You have reminded me, I really must plant some more rocket. I have the seeds, but keep forgetting to put them in. Few salads grow more easily, even in a large flowerpot, and I like the way you can just keep picking them all summer. Few leaves have that clean, peppery edge, though I would rather have a glut of watercress!</p> <p>Yes, rocket pesto, or salsa di ruchetta, can be on the bitter side, especially if it is made with really punchy rocket. It will be less so if you mix in a small quantity of parsley, but the underlying bitterness will still be present.</p> <p>The secret is to add just a little bit of sugar. I was against the idea at first, and tried making mine with a sweet, bland olive oil and then a little more Parmesan in an attempt to avoid adding the sugar, but in truth you really don't need much - I think you can get away with a mean teaspoon per 200g rocket, and in terms of the quantity of rocket leaves, that is almost negligible. Even so, it will make a huge difference.</p> <p>By the way, have you ever used it as a spread on bruschetta? Just fabulous, with a clean, peppery taste and masses of aromatic bite.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, It's probably thanks to you that I now use my juicer more often. And as you say, the chore of washing it seems less of a bore if you accept beforehand that cleaning it is part of the routine. </p> <p>I find it easier to keep mine on the draining board and to have a large vegetable brush handy. I often make carrot juice instead of an afternoon cup of tea for my husband and myself. My query concerns the debris left after juicing carrots. It seems such a waste to throw it away. Would it still contain any nutrients? Surely it would be worth using, if only for the fibre? <br><strong>All good wishes, Gitta Zarum</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Gitta, Juicing does produce a lot of debris. Yes, there will be a fair amount of nutrients left, not to mention a goodly sum of roughage, but this is the way I look at it: if I was really worried about losing all that, then I would be eating the carrots whole rather than juicing them. I guess we either eat the vegetables or drink them - we can't have it both ways. You could make the debris into vegetable cakes, but it sounds a bit parsimonious to me, like boiling up peelings for soup. I think the machine has taken out enough of the goodness for us to forget about the peel and pips, and just chuck it on the compost. It will probably do more good there than in our stomachs.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> However much trouble I take when making gratin dauphinois or other gratin-type dishes with milk/cream (leeks, courgettes, etc), the milk always seems to separate in cooking, leaving me with a mixture of water and curdle. How can I avoid this? I always heat the milk before putting it in the dish, and place the dish in a pre-heated oven (200C).<br><strong>Patricia Kinder, Paris</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Patricia, I think your oven temperature is a bit too high. This gorgeous dish, with its layers of velvety soft potatoes held together with thick garlicky cream, is best cooked very slowly, so that the cream and milk don't boil. About 160C should do it. Try the lower temperature, and I think the problem will disappear. As will the dauphinois.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel: Every recipe I have ever read for risotto says that it will take about 20 minutes for the rice to absorb the gradually added liquid to the right texture and consistency. I have never made risotto that hasn't taken at least twice this length of time, and also much more than the specified quantity of liquid. Why is this? <br><strong>Name withheld</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Well, there are several points here. I have said before that time is a very unreliable way to measure the progress of a dish. But it is all part of the fact that in Britain we are obsessed with following recipes word for word rather than cooking with our senses. All rice is different and it cannot be expected to cook at exactly the same speed. There are several different types of risotto rice, and the make-up of their starch cells is all slightly different. This affects the cooking time. Some rice swells quickly; others take a while to plump up with stock. The age of the rice will also make a slight difference.</p> <p>But there are other reasons why your risottos may take a while longer to cook. It may be that your stock is not as hot as usual, or that you have let the rice cook too long before adding the stock (the rice grains will harden if left too long before the liquid is added). Maybe you like your rice a little softer than the people whose recipes you follow. Personally, I think 20 minutes is somewhat pushing it anyway. Mine tend to take a bit longer - yes, sometimes as long as 40 minutes. And as to the quantity of liquid, I couldn't agree with you more. I have never found a risotto recipe that didn't underestimate the liquid quantity. I think it's so the readers won't be frightened off by how much stock they will need!</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hi Nigel, I love roast beef but I have never been able to do it successfully at home. The reason for this is that we are a small family and simply cannot afford to buy a large joint of rib or sirloin for three people. I yearn for thick, tender slices and the astonishing burst of joy in the mouth from biting into crisp, golden-brown fat with a mouthful of tender, juicy pink beef - yet what I achieve with a very small joint of topside or silverside (often sold as 'roasting joints' by supermarkets) is overcooked, dry brown meat, or nearly raw and still-tough slices, however thinly it's cut. My yearning is becoming an obsession. Is there any way to achieve a decent result with such a cut? <br><strong>Merry xxx</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Dear Merry, It's not your cooking that needs help, it's your shopping! What are you doing buying something as important as the meat for your Sunday roast from a supermarket? They might be good for bin liners and washing-up liquid, but if there is one thing supermarkets don't do well it is meat (or fish or cheese, for that matter). If a roast is to be tender, then it has to be from meat that has been properly hung and has a good marbling of fat. My advice is to go to a (good) local butcher rather than a supermarket for your beef. Explain that you only want a small piece - and you will be surprised what he will find for you.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Why do all the food gurus and chefs think samphire needs cooking? Can you enlighten me? <br><strong>Louise Hopes</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You are right. Samphire doesn't always need cooking. But some can be excessively salty, depending on where it is grown, and cooking it will take away some of its salinity. If it is cooked lightly, for just a minute or two, it will be as fresh and bright as you could wish for and a great accompaniment to fish or, to my taste, lamb. If it is overcooked, it will be just as ghastly as overcooked cabbage. Another point: a brief plunge into boiling water will see off any unwanted bugs that may have been hanging around the seashore.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, I have never read a description of how to deal with the recalcitrant artichoke in such a way to make it seem easy rather than incredibly fiddly. Please could you enlighten me how to treat this most wonderful foodstuff? Best wishes. <br><strong>Michael Shmith, Richmond, Australia</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I too have read pages and pages of explicitly detailed instructions for dealing with this majestic and under-used vegetable. It's like: let's see how complicated we can make this, let's see if we can put everyone off this glorious vegetable! Michael, ignore it all. Don't do any of that snipping and fiddling around that everyone tells you to. Just rinse the artichokes well (insects love hiding in between the layers of leaves), drop them into furiously boiling, lightly salted water, and let them cook until you can pull away one of the leaves without much effort. Then drain.</p> <p>I eat mine by pulling out the hot leaves one at a time with my fingers and dipping them into olive oil, melted butter or a pot of hollandaise sauce. When I have pulled the flesh off each leaf with my teeth, I pull out the thistly bit from the bottom of the artichoke and discard it with the sucked leaves. (There is usually a huge pile of debris.) You will be left with a soft green cup of artichoke flesh. It's the best bit of all, though not as much fun as sucking warm butter from the leaves.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I often cook fish, especially mackerel, by covering it completely in rock salt or sea salt. Does the salt absorb all the oil and, hence, all the good omega-3s? <br><strong>Andy Stringer, Streatham</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What an interesting question. I love this way of cooking whole fish - and chicken, too. Whole mackerels are particularly delicious baked in a covering of wet salt. They stay moist and juicy and the skin just peels away when you crack open the baked salt. But I am going to have to phone a friend over this one. Dr Briffa, who knows more about omega 3 than I do, says: 'Andrew's question stems from the notion that salt can \"draw\" fluid into it. This effect may possibly be relevant to the water content of a food, but whether it has any bearing on any fatty component is unlikely. Also, even if some omega-3 fat was lost to the salt, the chances are this would only affect the most superficial part of the fish. It is highly unlikely that salt encrustment will have much bearing on the omega-3 content of oily fish.' </p> <p>So it looks like we can keep on baking our fish in a salt crust. If you've never tried it, I recommend it. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Hello Nigel, I'd really like to make panna cotta, but where I am - County Clare in Ireland - I can only get powdered gelatine. Can I use that instead? <br><strong>Thank you, Emma Stewart-Liberty </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Yes, it is infuriating that leaf gelatine is so difficult to get hold of. It is one of the reasons I so rarely run a recipe using gelatine. Most professional cooks and chefs wouldn't dream of using the powdered stuff. It causes more problems than any other ingredient I know of. We prefer leaf because, unlike the gelatine powder, it is easy to use and gives a gentler set. All you have to do is push the leaves into a bowl of cold water and let them soften for a few minutes, then drop them into the warm mixture and they will dissolve without trace. The finished mousse, souffle or panna cotta will be a more subtle affair altogether with leaf gelatine. If you were making blancmange or even a lemon mousse, I would suggest you could use either type, but not in a panna cotta. The recipe is just too delicate.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Dear Nigel, My wife reads your column and has books and tapes from TV of all your work. So we watch this episode with you and your 'comfort food' and the bit with the new potatoes in the French soft cheese. I agree with her that it looks good, so we push the boat out (Northern saying) and purchase an Epoisses for \u00a34.99 from Tesco so we can do a retake. However, we don't even get to push our forks into the cheese for the wine to get into the Epoisses, as it just stinks!</p> <p>My question is this: this cheese, is it off, or should it really smell this bad? I have the luxurious smooth cheese, washed with Marc de Bourgogne, in front of me now, and I can tell you that its scent is stronger than that of the stuff that collects between my toes! Our house is now unsellable and the children in the street throw stones at our windows shouting, 'Smelly, smelly - we hate you.' What have you done to us? Take care, Keith and Liz</p> <p><strong>A</strong> Ah yes, Epoisses - it does pong a bit. Heaven only knows what it smells like when it gets warm. Rather you than me. I am not surprised that your neighbours were throwing stones.</p> <p>If you are going to bake a whole French cheese, then you want nothing more exotic than a good old Camembert. It will smell very cheesy, and deeply comforting, but won't upset the neighbours. Simply secure the box with a staple or two (the glued ones come undone), then bake it in a hot oven till the cheese is bubbling. Dip in stalks of celery, hot new potatoes or just crusty bread. Once everyone smells that, they'll come knocking at your door for a taste.</p> <p>PS: Stinky cheese does have its uses. I once had a ghastly time at a bed and breakfast in France. The owner was so rude that I stuffed a ripe Epoisses behind the radiator in the bedroom before I left.</p>",
  "<p>This column is the hub of my working week - everything else is fitted around it. Each week I sit down and sort of write you a letter - although I don't know who you are. Just occasionally I meet some of you or you write to me, and if you say nice things about this column that counts for as much as anything in my working life. I am pathetically easily flattered. </p> <p>But we hardly ever talk. So, after 10 years, this is the first time that I am responding to your specific gardening concerns. </p> <p>When I started to write this column, I realised that the only way that I could work was to write about my own experiences and concerns. I am entirely self-taught, which means that my day-to-day gardening in my own back yard is my centre of knowledge. My gardening life is likely to be pretty much like yours, if perhaps a little more so, given that I am completely obsessed by it. But as I get older and more experienced, I still feel hopelessly ignorant about too much. I suppose I have now learnt enough to know how little I know. </p> <p>Obviously, I am sorry if you were not one of the few I have replied to here. Some questions I rejected because they were general and others required only a brief sentence or name, but I could have easily answered 10 or 12 different sets and have been as representative.</p> <p><strong>You ask the questions</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My wife and I are keen - if a little inexperienced - gardeners and last year we bought and planted out an established (3ft high) olive tree (Olea europaea). Last year's long, hot summer brought to bear a handful of tiny fruit that never developed. We live in Cambridgeshire and have reasonably mild winters. Our garden is sheltered and is east facing and the tree itself is planted on the southern side. Am I holding out too much hope that our olive tree will bear fruit? All references I have found tend to suggest that trees rarely bear fruit outside the Mediterranean. <br><strong>Neil and Lois Rowlands</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you have fantasies of pressing your own oil a move to Tuscany would be quicker and cheaper. But it should be straightforward enough to raise an interesting and handsome plant. They like a very well-drained, light, alkaline soil and need very little water. I would definitely grow it in a pot that can be taken outside for the summer and then brought in under glass for winter, mixing a peat-free potting compost 50:50 with grit. They are tender and should be kept frost-free as far as possible, but do not make the mistake of heating them in winter and keeping the air good and dry. In spring, at the first sign of growth, water them with a seaweed solution and repeat this monthly until autumn. Put them outside at the beginning of May, but have some fleece handy in case there is a late frost, and bring them back under cover around the end of September. As with citrus, only water when the soil is bone dry. And if you do take the Tuscany option, I'm up for a bottle of the first pressing.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have had such a problem with slugs this year. They have decimated flowers and veg. My lupins didn't flower because they'd been so badly eaten; every delphinium I plant gets reduced to twigs within 48 hours; pretty much every vegetable I've planted has been eaten as soon as it pokes its head above the soil. I try to garden totally organically and I am thinking of getting some nematodes - is there a best time of year to introduce them and do they need re-applying at a certain interval? <br><strong>Yours hopefully, Alice Fox, Shipley</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> There is no easy answer to this, Alice. Slugs are with most of us and they are here to stay. Global warming means that they overwinter much more than they used to and in any realistic world we have to learn to share the garden with them. </p> <p>Slug pellets have very limited use and are harmful to the garden's ecobalance, so they are not an option. I have found various barriers, such as beer traps, grit, eggshells or even human hair, to be a waste of time, although old copper piping worked as a barrier around seedlings outside.</p> <p>All the following things will help. The parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a minute worm that infects the host with a fatal disease and, rather gratifyingly, eats the slug up from the inside. Yum. You buy them live, mixed with a clay-based agent, which must be diluted with water. The solution is then watered on to the area you wish to protect. The soil must be warm and wet for them to work and they need time to breed; normally, they only stay effective for about six weeks. Ducks, hedgehogs and beetles eat slugs and thrushes love a snail. A sawn-off plastic bottle over young seedlings works well but looks horrid. Rotovating bare soil in winter chops up some slugs and exposes others to hungry birds. </p> <p>But I prefer a more general approach. My own garden is riddled with slugs and yet I have come to an acceptable level of accommodation by working out various avoidance and diversionary tactics. To start with, I would highly recommend getting a greenhouse or at least a cold frame that can be kept more or less slug-free. I sow as much as possible in containers and grow the seedlings in this protected zone. After hardening off outside (in another area with a daily anti-slug patrol), I plant them out. By this time they are both coarse enough and growing quickly enough to resist being eaten. This system works beautifully for things like lettuce, beans, or tender annuals like cosmos. </p> <p>The other important factors are timing and feeding. Slugs like young, soft tissue, so make it available for as short a time as possible. Harden the plants off really well before planting out, so that they are acclimatised and will grow quickly. I often pick a lettuce that has a dozen small slugs secreted about it, although the leaves appear practically untouched. It means everything must be carefully washed, but that is an acceptable price to pay. </p> <p>Resist sowing or planting tender plants too soon. It is better to wait another week or so than risk losing plants, and do not feed plants more than is necessary. Feed the soil, not the plant. This will avoid a spurt of soft, sappy growth, which slugs love. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I had grown a magnificent 8ft onopordum from seed and then the Cornish gales came. I noticed that you had them as focal points in the beds at Berryfield. How do you stake them without it looking ugly?<br><strong>Jenny Blincoe, Fowey, Cornwall</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Onopordums are the prickliest, biggest, baddest thistle there is. They look fantastic, are easy to grow, and self-seed, so you only ever need buy a couple to have a supply for ever. But they are an absolute bugger to support. I get round it by using fencing stakes and thick hop twine, and even then I usually leave it too late and a storm sends them sprawling. In short, use the thickest stake you can buy and try and hide it as best you can. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> The apples on our Bramley apple tree, which we planted eight years ago, suffer badly with bitter pit. We pruned it hard back, but still the crop suffered from the brown pit marks. Is there anything we can do to remedy the situation? We have a warm and dry walled garden with several other fruit and apple trees. <br><strong>Jackie Sayer</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I like the sound of a warm and dry walled garden but therein, I suspect, lies your problem. But first three cheers for planting a Bramley. They make the best of garden trees - becoming solid and avuncular without overwhelming even a small garden and are perfect for a swing. Also, we must all fight for our orchards and mature apple trees. </p> <p>As a result of the recent withdrawal of EU subsidy, farmers are now grubbing out orchards that are extremely old, extremely beautiful and almost irreplaceable. It is a monstrous piece of eco-vandalism that is a result of the crazy CAP, tyrannical supermarkets and our willingness to tolerate cheap, tasteless food.</p> <p>Back to bitter pit. You can recognise this by the sunken pockmarks on the fruit surface. Then, when you peel the apple there are brown bits on the flesh beneath each pit. The main problem is that it dramatically reduces the apple's keeping time. It is caused by a calcium deficiency in the fruit itself and is induced by water shortage. Hence the clue in your warm and dry walled garden. If it is planted up against the warm and dry wall, it will be drier still, as any wall sucks away moisture from the ground. </p> <p>Clearly, a lot of extra watering will sort this out, but it is just as important to reduce the competition for water by clearing an area a metre in radius right round the tree and mulching this thickly with straw, grass cuttings or wood chips. Manure or compost will tend to induce too much soft growth without increasing fruit production, but it will not do any harm if it is the most convenient material to use. </p> <p>Some varieties, such as 'Newton Wonder', 'Bramley's Seedling' and 'Egremont Russet', are more susceptible to bitter pit than others, so consider an alternative to these if you live in an area of low rainfall or have a warm, dry, walled garden. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> How do you get around the problem of oriental poppies leaving holes in your planting? They are a large plant until mid-June, but then you're left with a big gap in the border when you cut them back after flowering. I have three clumps in my mixed border (of 'Karine' and 'Patty's Plum') which grow to nearly a metre in diameter each, but afterwards I'm left with a crown of about 20cm and a big bare patch all around. This year I managed to buy some tall-ish bedding - salvias and snapdragons - and I have planted these around the crowns, but I am still not convinced this is the best solution. What do you suggest? <br><strong>Sam Grover, Bristol</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hey Sam, let's call it a space rather than a hole, and an opportunity rather than a problem. I plant tender annuals into the opportunity as soon as I have chopped the poppies back. This year it was tithonias and cosmos. Inevitably, both sit without doing much for a while, but the light and space give them a chance to get growing rather than having to compete with other plants. Buying bedding is a good solution, but sowing some well ahead of time so that you have choice and control is the best solution of all. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> We have a wooden pergola with a lattice down one side (about 10 years old) which is covered by some gorgeous New Dawn roses. The rose, of course, twines through the lattice and around the pergola and the wood in the pergola is rotting. We would like to replace it with a more robust version, probably oak. But how do we replace it without having to severely prune the rose? I have attached a photo of the rose in full glory. <br><strong>Madeleine Haines</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Thanks for the picture Madeleine, and yes, you are right, it is lovely and it is swamped. But this is not a pergola question so much as a pruning one. You can't have both rose and pergola as they are, so the rose will have to be radically hacked back from the wooden support. The good news is that this will not damage it and, if two or three healthy young shoots can be salvaged at a reasonable length, then it should do it a lot of good, with it growing back in full flowering glory the following year. </p> <p>The secret is to never let the growing shoots wind themselves around the support. Instead, you must attach them to it so they are resting against it. Then they can be untied and gently lowered. </p> <p>There is also a pruning regime that allows you to annually correct and repair the trend towards entanglement. This should be done as soon as the rose finishes flowering - which in the case of New Dawn could be well into October. The idea is to take out some of the old wood each year, pruning it right down to the base of the plant, leaving behind a tracery of uncluttered straight stems attached to the outside of the archway. Reduce the lateral growth from these stems so that nothing is touching or crossing. Do this every year and the plant will remain controllable, as well as renewing itself completely every three or four years. On the other hand, you could let it froth and foam freely, just sniping off the bits that catch in your hair and accepting a total revamp every 10 years or so.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Our four-year-old rosemary bush suddenly and spontaneously passed away. It stood among other shrubs by a north-facing wall. Should we try again in the same place, or move to the south-facing fence, together with the more exotic shrubs? <br><strong>Richard Bateman, Walsall </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Rosemary is surprisingly hardy and will take winter frosts well below -10C, but it hates sitting in wet soil, especially in winter. Like all Mediterranean herbs, rosemary needs as much sun as you have to give it, and a north-facing wall is probably the worst possible place to put one. It also thrives in very poor, well-drained soil, so it can easily be killed with kindness. Start again in a sunny spot, adding lots of drainage (sharpsand, grit, even rough stones) and do not give it any compost, manure or fertiliser. Oh, and it's a plant, Richard. It did not 'pass away'. It died. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a problem growing sweet peas. They grow tall but never produce many flowers, even though I pick them. What soil, feed and position are the best to get good results?<br><strong>Sally Roberts</strong></p> <p>Each year I raise sweet peas from seed and plant good little plants out in spring - and each year, after a first flush of lovely long-stemmed blooms, the second flush can only produce flowers on short stems of about 3in long. Am I starving them? <br><strong>Jan Church</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> First, Sally, do you pinch out the leader when they are a few inches tall? This is important, as it promotes side shoots - which bear the flowers - rather than strong upright growth. You might have to do this several times before planting out so you have a bushy, short plant that needs no support rather than a spindly, floppy affair. </p> <p>Sweet peas need rich, moisture-retentive soil so sow the seed in a good potting compost (I add some sieved garden compost, too) but do not over water until they have developed a leaf or two, and then never let them fully dry out. They like cool conditions, so semi-shade is ideal. I grow mine up wigwams of hazel bean sticks and before I make each support I dig a pit under the site and fill it with garden compost. This feeds the brutes and acts as a sponge to hold water for them. Having very rich soil and lots of water will make for bushier, healthier plants with lots more flowers. As for your short stems, Jan, this is because the first flower has had all the energy of the plant focused on to it. Professional growers pinch out all side branches and tendrils save for one, to try and get as long a stem as possible. For most of us, the shorter stems of the subsequent batch of flowers is a price worth paying for the extra blooms. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My front garden is full of English marigolds and now I would like some in my back garden, but garden centres seem to sell only French marigolds. How could I produce new plants from the seeds of my plants, and when is the best time to do this?<br><strong> Carol Mooney, Blackpool</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> The English or 'pot' marigold is calendula and self-seeds prolifically, which is why, in your front garden, they have multiplied over the years. The easiest way of getting them into the back garden is either to collect seed from these in late summer, keep it in the fridge over winter and sow them in March, or move some seedlings next spring, while they are still small. Otherwise most seed companies will supply them from a garden centre or by mail order. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Which pot plants would you suggest for an urban balcony? It is southwest-facing on the second floor and susceptible to prevailing winds. A cantilever roof shields the balcony from rain, necessitating hand watering with (hard) tap water. <br><strong>Jo Langley, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It sounds as though you have an ideal position, facing southwest to get the afternoon and evening sun, sheltered from cold winds and with a cover to protect from the worst weather. Even warm wind is desiccating, so a screen would help - ideally a glass or Perspex one, so it does not block out too much light. A strong balcony can take an awful lot of pots of varying sizes. But it will mean daily watering or investing in a simple irrigation system. Actually, I think hand watering is good because it becomes part of your intimate acquaintance with the plants.</p> <p>Potting compost becomes a big issue on a balcony. Ideally it is water-retentive, nutritious, but also drains well and allows a healthy root run. Avoid any peat-based compost - I would recommend an organic soil-based potting compost or one based on crushed bark. And make sure that every pot has crocks or broken polystyrene at the base to help drainage - very few plants survive sitting in water. </p> <p>If you do not use peat - and I strongly urge you not to - then you will find it difficult to grow many ericaceous plants such as heathers, rhododendrons, camellias or pieris. However, most plants grow in most situations in most soils.</p> <p>I would go for a seasonal succession, starting with pots of snowdrops and crocus, perhaps with some daffodils coming through. Tulips look wonderful in pots. If possible I would have a number of smaller pots, each with a single variety. These can be left tucked away for the summer. Geraniums will do well, and you could have flowering shrubs of a hundred different types, from ribes to roses as well as topiary in box - which is very happy in pots - for green structure. A friend of mine successfully grew a wide range of veg on a balcony in Gray's Inn Road, including lettuce crops, runner beans, tomatoes and even potatoes, and I would certainly do this with growbags and a couple of large pots. Chillies and peppers are ideal for a sunny balcony, although have some fleece handy in case of cold late-summer nights. I'd also suggest some herbs - rosemary and thyme in one pot and some annuals like basil and parsley in another. </p> <p>Finally, whatever you grow, you'll need to supply some extra feed, and I suggest a weekly watering of a liquid seaweed solution. As for strength and regularity, the best advice is: weakly weekly.</p>",
  "<p>It should make us happy, but environmentalists are deeply alarmed: Prozac, the anti-depression drug, is being taken in such large quantities that it can now be found in Britain's drinking water. </p> <p>Environmentalists are calling for an urgent investigation into the revelations, describing the build-up of the antidepressant as 'hidden mass medication'. The Environment Agency has revealed that Prozac is building up both in river systems and groundwater used for drinking supplies. </p> <p>The government's chief environment watchdog recently held a series of meetings with the pharmaceutical industry to discuss any repercussions for human health or the ecosystem. </p> <p>The discovery raises fresh fears that GPs are overprescribing Prozac, Britain's antidepressant of choice. In the decade up to 2001, overall prescriptions of antidepressants rose from nine million to 24 million a year. </p> <p>A recent report by the Environment Agency concluded Prozac could be potentially toxic in the water table and said the drug was a 'potential concern'. </p> <p>However, the precise quantity of Prozac in the nation's water supplies remains unknown. The government's Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) said Prozac was likely to be found in a considerably 'watered down' form that was unlikely to pose a health risk. </p> <p>Dr Andy Croxford, the Environment's Agency's policy manager for pesticides, told The Observer: 'We need to determine the effects of this low-level, almost continuous discharge.' </p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat's environment spokesman, said the revelations exposed a failing by the government on an important public health issue. He added that the public should be told if they were inadvertently taking drugs like Prozac. </p> <p>'This looks like a case of hidden mass medication upon the unsuspecting public,' Baker said. 'It is alarming that there is no monitoring of levels of Prozac and other pharmacy residues in our drinking water.' </p> <p>Experts say that Prozac finds its way into rivers and water systems from treated sewage water. Some believe the drugs could affect their reproductive ability. </p> <p>European studies have also expressed disquiet over the impact of pharmaceuticals building up in the environment, warning that an effect on wildlife and human health 'cannot be excluded'. </p> <p>'It is extremely unlikely that there is a risk, as such drugs are excreted in very low concentrations,' a DWI spokesman said. 'Advanced treatment processes installed for pesticide removal are effective in removing drug residues,' he added.</p>"
