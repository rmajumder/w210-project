  "<p>Two of the greatest 20th-century British poets of place, Ted Hughes and WH Auden, came late in their lives to resemble the landscapes they loved. One thinks of Hughes's great granitic head, more tor than skull, and of the Auden of the 1960s, his face deeply creased and grooved laterally, like the limestone pavements of Yorkshire in which so much of his early poetry is grounded. </p> <p>John Muir also grew into likeness with the mountains he adored. The most famous photograph of Muir - the guardian of Yosemite, the family man, the esteemed essayist and memoirist - shows him in profile, seated on a boulder of his beloved Californian granite. The tones of his shirt and the colour of his beard rhyme perfectly with the pale grey of the rock beneath him. He is half Victorian patriarch, half geological extrusion. </p> <p>Muir (1838-1914) himself never knew quite what he was, and it delighted him not to know. \"I am a poetico-trampo-geologist-bot. and ornith-natural, etc.!!!\" he wrote gleefully to a friend in 1873. Looking back over his long life, one sees why he had to weld together such a compound description of himself -there are so many John Muirs. There is Muir the long-distance tramp, vagabondising 1,000 miles from Indianapolis to the Gulf of Mexico. There is Muir the mountaineer, stalking the high ridges of the Sierra Nevada range in California, and making the first ascents of several of its biggest peaks. There is Muir the geologist, decoding the glacial origins of the Yosemite Valley. There is Muir the explorer, opening up unmapped regions of Alaska in his 50s. There is Muir the botanist, striding through the pollinous bee-meadows of the Sierra, counting the 10,000 flower-heads in a square yard of sub-alpine pasture, and worshipping in the crypt-light of the sequoia groves. There is Muir the activist, successfully lobbying Congress for the creation of a national park in the Yosemite region. And there is, of course, Muir the nature writer, finessing a prose style which, more purely and ringingly than any other, communicates the joy of being out of doors. </p> <p>If you have heard of Muir before, it will probably have been as the third name in a sentence which includes Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Too often, at least in Britain, Muir is tucked away like this, lost in the pockets of the two great American sages of nature. True, Muir's environmental metaphysics were less instantly complex than those of Emerson or Thoreau. But his soul was tingled by landscape in ways which Thoreau's and Emerson's never were, and it is this which makes him more enduringly important than either of his predecessors. </p> <p>Reading Walden, or Emerson's essays, the natural world comes at you deodorised and desensitised, insulated behind the double glazing of logic and rhetoric. Muir's prose, by contrast, is a miracle of immediacy. His books, many of which were not published until very late in his life, have none of the elegiac and crepuscular quality of much memoir. They are illuminated by sunshine and starlight. The cold mineral air of the mountains and the resiny reek of coniferous forests lift bracingly off his pages. No other writer is so ceaselessly astonished by the natural world as Muir, or communicates that astonishment more urgently. Muir lived - as he put it in a typically lovely phrase - \"in an infinite storm of beauty\", and his readers live in it with him. </p> <p>In North America, Muir has achieved the status of prophet. He founded the Sierra Club, which now has more than 600,000 members and is the most formidable environmental pressure group in the States. So many peaks, lakes and glaciers have been named after Muir that the US Geological Survey has been obliged to issue a statement declaring that they would \"not be likely to approve any further such commemorations\". Three plants, a butterfly, a mineral have been christened in his honour, as well as, less appropriately, a touring musical, and the John Muir Parkway, a four-lane freeway in Martinez, California. </p> <p>Muir's reputation in Britain, the place of his birth - in Dunbar, Scotland, third child of a fiercely Presbyterian farmer and lay preacher - is less secure, and his influence less ubiquitous. There is, though, one key British organisation to which he has lent his name and his ethos. The John Muir Trust, which celebrates its 21st anniversary this year, is the foremost wild-land protection group in Britain. It owns and manages seven substantial areas in Scotland, including 3,000 acres of the remote Knoydart peninsula; 11,000 acres of Sandwood Bay, the great white strand near Cape Wrath in Sutherland and - perhaps most marvellously - a large portion of the Ben Nevis massif, which includes the mountain's highest summit. </p> <p>\"Wildness,\" wrote Muir, \"is a necessity; and mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.\" This was the insight he bequeathed to modernity: that a landscape might be valuable not in terms of the economic or agrarian resources it provides, but in terms - harder to measure, harder to prove - of its profound spiritual effect. In the words of one of Muir's disciples, the American novelist and essayist Wallace Stegner, we need \"wild country available to us, even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in. For it can be a means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as creatures, a part of the geography of hope.\" </p> <p>nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;* * * </p> <p>Like all those who survive posterity's prolific deletions, Muir's life has the outline of a myth. At least the way he told it, he underwent a spiritual conversion at the hands of nature. In the course of a single remarkable summer, Muir was transformed from the son of a preacher to a child of nature. </p> <p>In 1849 the Muir family had moved from Scotland to Wisconsin in search of a new life. Trying to ripen farmland out of the Wisconsin earth was arduous work, and between the ages of 11 and 22, Muir laboured on the farm. The family rose early, worked all day, and went to sleep immediately after evening prayers. When he was 15, Muir was set the task of excavating a well in the sandstone rock on which the farm stood. For several months, every day except Sundays, Muir was lowered alone in a bucket, with a single candle for light, to continue the digging work. At a depth of 80ft, he passed out for lack of oxygen. The next morning his father lowered him to the bottom again. Not until he was 90ft down did he hit water. What would now make for a best-selling Pelzerish memoir would, perversely, make Muir into a loafer. The virtues of diligence, labour and \"time-hoarding\", which had been drubbed into him during his adolescence - what he came to call his \"old bondage days\" - would be radically unlearned during a summer of ecstatic idleness in the Californian mountains. </p> <p>In 1868, aged 29, Muir arrived in San Francisco. He found the city oppressive and, in a now legendary exchange, stopped a passer-by to inquire the nearest way out of town. \"'But where do you want to go?' asked the man to whom I had applied for this important information. 'To any place that is wild,' I said. 'Yosemite' was the answer.\" And so off Muir went to the Sierra Nevada, the range of mountains which spines central California, and out of which the Yosemite Valley was glacially gouged during the Pleistocene era. </p> <p>The following May, Muir took a job in the Sierra as a shepherd. He was to move a sheep flock \"gradually higher through the successive forest belts as the snow melted, stopping for a few weeks at the best places we came to.\" My First Summer in the Sierra (1911) is Muir's account of this time - exploring, sleeping out, botanising, climbing - and is without doubt his finest single work. Reading the book now, one is rushed back to those joyous first months, and to Muir's drastic reimagining of himself. Here is his journal entry for June 6: \"We are now in the mountains and they are in us ... making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks, in the waves of the sun, - a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal ...\" </p> <p>Muir's pronouns tell the whole story. \"I\" has become \"we\": the monad of the Presbyterian soul has dissolved into the plurality of the pantheist's. What we see at work here is \"sympathy\" in its strongest 19th-century form - not feeling sorry for someone or something, or even feeling like them, but actually being them. The distance of simile has been abolished; Muir has become the mountains, and they have become him. My First Summer teems with passages like this, where Muir's self melts into his environment. His experiences of rapture were close to the classical Greek concept of \"metempsychosis\" (the transmigration of the spirit) or, to give it its beautiful German name, Seelenwanderung : \"soul-wandering\". \"I'm breathing the granite again,\" reads a journal entry from July. \"The mtns. are getting back into my blood.\" In 1870, when he was first falling in love with the Californian forests, Muir wrote a letter to a friend. He put his address down as \"Squirrelville, Sequoia Co, Nut time\". \"I'm in the woods woods woods,\" the letter began, \"&amp; they are in me-ee-ee.\" </p> <p>Muir's collected writings, most of which are set in the Californian mountains, comprise the greatest canticle for the wild ever written. In Britain, few words can be more trusted to shrivel the sensitive reader's enthusiasm than \"nature writing\". They tend to evoke the bearded enthusiasms of an over-earnest brigade of curates and minor gentry, a lazy Edwardian attentiveness, a nookishly myopic interest in rock-pools and phyla. Muir's robust and invigorating visions show how narrow-minded this set of connotations is. </p> <p>Lyricism is a function of precision, and Muir was unforgettably precise when writing about landscape. He noted the \"heavy masonry\" of the Sierra range. He wrote of the \"wind-history of trees\": the ways the screws and gyres of trunks and branches archived prevailing weather patterns. He walked across \"a field of snow as trackless as the sky\" (an image which tellingly predates aviation). He exulted in \"the wild gala-day of the north wind\". He described squirrels in their pines, \"fiery, peppery, full of brag and fight and show, with movements so quick and keen they almost sting the onlooker\". He followed a \"fat, pollen-dusted\" bumble bee as it \"rumbled among the flowers\". </p> <p>The intrepidity of Muir's wild experience is also unforgettable. JG Ballard once speculated on the leisure activities of the future. They would include, he proposed, lava-rafting and avalanche-surfing. He should have read Muir who, 100 years earlier, was already inhabiting Ballard's near future. In 1873, Muir surfed his first avalanche: \"I was swished down to the foot of the ca\u00f1on as if by enchantment. The wallowing ascent had taken nearly all day, the descent only about a minute. When the avalanche started I threw myself on my back and spread my arms to try to keep from sinking. Fortunately, though the grade of the ca\u00f1on is very steep, it is not interrupted by precipices large enough to cause outbounding or free-plunging. On no part of the rush was I buried. I was only moderately imbedded on the surface or at times a little below it, and covered with a veil of back-streaming dust particles; and as the whole mass beneath and about me joined in the flight there was no friction, though I was tossed here and there and lurched from side to side. When the avalanche swedged and came to rest I found myself on top of the crumpled pile without bruise or scar. This was a fine experience ... This flight in what might be called a milky way of snow-stars was the most spiritual and exhilarating of all the modes of motion I have ever experienced! Elijah's flight in a chariot of fire could hardly have been more gloriously exciting!\" </p> <p>There is so much to admire here, whether it is the \"veil of back-streaming dust particles\", or \"milky way of snow-stars\". What might, in the hands of another writer, have become a raucously self-vaunting anecdote of a life nearly lost - the prose equivalent of slamming a drained beer glass down on a table - is for Muir an experience midway between scientific experiment and religious epiphany. </p> <p>Muir's books are filled with such moments of ecstatic transport. When an earthquake strikes the Yosemite Valley at night in March 1872, he is woken by the shaking: \"The strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, near the Sentinel Rock, both glad and frightened, shouting, 'A noble earthquake!' ... The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves, and it seemed impossible the high cliffs should escape being shattered.\" </p> <p>On another occasion, in a now notorious incident of brinkmanship, Muir tracked the Yosemite Creek to the edge of an escarpment, where it falls half a mile \"in showy foam to another world\". Keen to hear \"the death song\" of the creek in its plummet, Muir clambered down to a \"narrow shelf about three inches wide on the very brink, just wide enough for a rest for one's heels ledge\". From there, soaked by spray, he \"obtained a perfectly free view down into the heart of the snowy, chanting throng of comet-like streamers into which the body of the fall soon separates\". </p> <p>There is nothing lazy about Muir. Reading him, you feel invulnerable. He gives you seven-league boots. He climbs high mountains in a single paragraph. Rock-fall, blizzard and avalanche cannot harm him. Even his metabolism is superhuman - when he goes off to climb a big peak, he typically \"fastens a hard, durable crust to my belt by way of provision in case I should be compelled to pass a night on the mountain-top\". </p> <p>Those who seek to disparage Muir often dismiss him as an over-writer. And it is true that, where the melancholic WG Sebald can sometimes seem like the Eeyore of non-fiction, there are times when the ceaselessly joyful Muir sounds too much like Molesworth's nature-loving schoolboy peer, Fotherington-Thomas. \"Hello birds, hello trees! Nature alone is beautiful!\" cries Fotherington-Thomas. \"How fine the weather is!\" cries Muir. \"Nothing more celestial can I conceive! How gently the winds blow!\" </p> <p>It is no surprise, indeed, to learn that the exclamation mark was Muir's favourite form of punctuation. Forster once likened the use of exclamation marks to laughing at one's own jokes, but nothing so solipsistic is at work with Muir. For him, the exclamation mark was just a way of notating rapture. There was never any self-admiration involved in his writing. </p> <p>nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;* * * </p> <p> After that magical first summer, Muir stayed in the valley for six years, rarely leaving its precincts. He climbed and explored, walked many thousands of miles, discovered the first living glaciers ever found in the region, mapped the distribution of the giant redwoods, guided famous visitors - including Emerson and Roosevelt - around the region, and built up the formidable archive of natural experience which would issue into his prose. Towards the end of that time, too, he launched his writing career with a series of articles called \"Studies in the Sierra\". It was Muir's prose, mostly published as articles and essays, which would win him such a massive public following, and give him such powerful political leverage. </p> <p>During the last four decades of Muir's life, he merged his intuitive and abstract love of wilderness with a great facility for realpolitik. He learned the need to lobby for the preservation of the landscapes he loved. The two principal results of Muir's political activities - the Sierra Club and Yosemite National Park - are enduring achievements. </p> <p>Less immediately obvious, but perhaps more deeply influential, was the revolution of wilderness sensibility which Muir's prose incited. Muir introduced the concept of interconnectedness; that, in his words, \"as soon as we take one thing by itself, we find it hitched to everything in the universe\". This, he proved, was an aesthetic truth as much as an ecological one. Beauty, like nature, existed as a network and not a hierarchy. Muir also explained and energised a sense of the spiritual worth of wilderness. He asked the question not of what wild places can do for humanity, but what they can do to it. Muir's proclamations about the wilderness have a burry relevance to them - they become ever more insistently attached to our culture. \"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilised people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home,\" he wrote in 1901. </p> <p>Unlike so many eminent Victorians, who survive only as sepia print or guano-streaked statuary, Muir has grown in importance since his death. The American left in particular, in its huge battles with the Bush administrations over environmental use, has needed Muir this past 20 years. In a curious recent twist, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in an attempt to further green his regime, has commissioned Muir's face as the icon for the new California state quarter. Muir is needed in the UK, too. There is a false and dangerous amnesia at work concerning the very existence of wild places in these islands. False, because it is clear that the British Isles in fact still seethe with wildness and wilderness. And dangerous, because it licenses a laissez-faire attitude towards the wilderness which does remain; if we do not think it is there, we will not take care of it. I have said it before, but it cannot be said often enough: the natural world becomes far more easily disposable if it is not imaginatively known, and a failure to include it in a literary regard can slide easily into a failure to include it in a moral regard. </p> <p>And this is why Muir's fiercely immediate attention to the power of wildness to change us as humans - the power of outer landscapes to reshape for the better our inner landscapes - is so valuable and so political. Most people in Britain exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed, and controlled. It is easy to forget that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Yet were Britain to bankrupt itself of wilderness - as it is perfectly capable of doing - the change in the country's mood and morale would be devastating. One thinks here of Auden's tersely brilliant observation that \"a culture is no better than its woods\". The preservation of wild places is as essential to Britain's geography of hope as urban regeneration, and John Muir is the finest geographer of hope we could ever wish for. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Macfarlane's Mountains of the Mind: A History of a Fascination (Granta) won the Guardian First Book award, 2003.

  "<p>The Manchurian Candidate of 1962, directed by John Frankenheimer from Richard Condon's thriller, is a chunk of America's psycho-history - as much oracle as movie - steeped in what Norman Mailer called \"that concentration of ecstasy and violence which is the dream life of the nation\". Not surprisingly, Jonathan Demme's remake, conceived in the aftermath of 9/11 and opening in the midst of the 2004 presidential campaign, has been received as an intervention, a desecration, a revision and an all-purpose metaphor. </p> <p>Condon's 1959 bestseller featured a Korean war hero created and programmed by the Chinese communists to serve as the \"sleeper\" assassin who will allow anti-communist triple agents to stage an election year coup d'etat. In essence, Condon suggested the cold war was a Soviet-American co-production. US electoral politics were represented as the province of communist dupes and zombie secret agents, while the novel's demagogic Joseph McCarthy figure himself turned out to be a Soviet creation. One brain washed the other; left- and right-wing paranoia merged. The scenario was nothing less than a satiric version of the John Birch Society's Black Book, which held President Dwight D Eisenhower to be a dedicated servant of the international communist conspiracy. </p> <p>Produced by its star Frank Sinatra's company and released by United Artists, The Manchurian Candidate became the quintessential Kennedy-era thriller. Indeed, there's a sense in which the movie is the Kennedy era - the epitome of glamour and anxiety, an anthology of cold- war anxieties ranging from TV image-building to communist infiltration of the government, which materialised at the height of the Cuban missile crisis to startle audiences with a baroque tale of mind-control, assassination and conspiracy. </p> <p>Sinatra was known to be a presidential pal and, when the Democratic honchos who then ran UA deemed The Manchurian Candidate too controversial to touch, Kennedy proved instrumental in getting the movie made. (Although JFK previewed The Manchurian Candidate at the White House in late August 1962, history does not record his response. Perhaps he was distracted - that day a U-2 spy plane had reported eight missile installations in Cuba that were only weeks away from being operational.) Two months later, The Manchurian Candidate had its premiere as Soviet ships steamed towards the US quarantine line surrounding Cuba, and Under-Secretary of State George Ball warned UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson that there could be a \"shooting war\" by the following afternoon. </p> <p> The Manchurian Candidate opened at the climax of the cold war and fulfilled its prophetic mission 13 months later when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. One researcher recently proposed The Manchurian Candidate as the \"trigger film\" for the ex-marine, returned defector, sniper-or-patsy Lee Harvey Oswald. There's no proof that Oswald ever saw or even heard of The Manchurian Candidate but, even so, the circuit is complete: the movie Kennedy inspired also served as his death warrant. </p> <p>That the Manchurian candidate is a myth may be gauged by two seemingly indestructible misapprehensions, both regularly reiterated in reviews of Demme's remake. The first is the stubborn insistence that the 1962 movie had been a commercial failure and was thus an arcane message or a missed prophecy. In fact, having supplanted Darryl Zanuck's D-Day epic The Longest Day, The Manchurian Candidate reigned as national box-office champ (just in time for Kennedy's mid-term elections). The second misapprehension is that, following the Kennedy assassination, a remorseful Sinatra withdrew the movie from circulation. On the contrary: The Manchurian Candidate was re-released in early 1964 and, revived in the 1970s, it was used to \"explain\" the election-altering shootings of Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy and George Wallace. (Truman Capote made waves in 1968 when he proposed on The Tonight Show that RFK assassin Sirhan Sirhan was a programmed \"Manchurian candidate\".) </p> <p>Six months after the Wallace shooting in 1972, and a decade after The Manchurian Candidate's initial release, Sinatra reasserted his rights in a contractual dispute with UA and the movie disappeared from cinemas, if not television or popular consciousness. The Manchurian Candidate 's extremely literal and highly fanciful view of behavioural modification remained topical, particularly after revelations of CIA mind-control experiments became public in the mid-1970s. Some 25 years after its release, a network television documentary based on John Marks' 1980 CIA expos\u00e9, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, used clips from the Frankenheimer film to illustrate its thesis. </p> <p>Slick and sombre, Demme's new Candidate lacks the giddy insolence of its predecessor. The tale of a programmed \"sleeper\" assassin, a high-level political conspiracy, and an election-year coup isn't played for gleeful dark comedy; the update recalls Alan Pakula's post-Watergate, crypto- Manchurian remake The Parallax View as much as Frankenheimer's original. Gone is Frankenheimer's svelte Resnais-influenced integration of dreams, flashbacks and daylight reality. The cold war is no longer the nightmare from which Frank Sinatra is trying to awake. Rather, it's the new world order. The bogus military hero Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and his commanding officer (Denzel Washington in the Sinatra role) have their brains washed during Operation Desert Storm; the title now refers to the mega- corporate Manchurian Global, part Halliburton, part Carlyle Group. Coup d'\u00e9tat has been reformulated as \"regime change\" and there's a red-meat evocation of \"the first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States\". </p> <p>Sinatra's daughter Tina had long been interested in a Manchurian remake, but the project was only given the go-ahead in September 2001. The new version was co-produced by Democratic activist Scott Rudin for Paramount Pictures, whose head of production, Sherry Lansing, is a contributor to the Kerry campaign - as is Sumner Redstone, CEO of Paramount's corporate parent, Viacom. (Paramount has also released Hollywood's most scurrilous contribution to the political season, the raunchy puppet animation Team America: World Police.) Several writers were involved but, according to Rudin, once he and Daniel Pyne (who previously adapted The Sum of All Fears) shifted the emphasis to corporate chicanery, \"You could feel the script start to be alive.\" </p> <p>The second Manchurian Candidate belongs to Bush II nearly as much as the original did to JFK. The movie was in production during the run-up to and early months of the Iraq war, with dialogue rewritten in the light of unfolding events. And, from the opening theme, Wyclef Jean's cover of the anti-Bush anthem Fortunate Son , through the references to \"no-bid contracts\", computerised voting and constant terror alerts, to the elaboration of a corporate conspiracy to install a \"sleeper\" as president, the remake is an unambiguous attack on the current American administration. Despite the internet-fuelled rumour that Meryl Streep was evoking Hillary Clinton for her character, her portrayal of the candidate's mother is far more evocative of Bush aide Karen Hughes - or perhaps even Bush's own mother who, according to Kevin Phillips's American Dynasty, had spoken of becoming First Lady as early as the late 1940s. </p> <p>A week before the second Candidate opened, the New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman, a relentless Bush critic, imagined a scenario for \"The Arabian Candidate\" in which Islamic fanatics installed a puppet US president who presented himself as the leader in a war against terrorism. Opening in the US less than 24 hours after the Democratic National Convention ended, the movie struck Krugman's colleague, the cultural pundit Frank Rich, as being so blatantly partisan that it \"could pass for the de facto fifth day of the convention itself\". </p> <p>Of course, rightwing websites were already attacking John Kerry as a Manchurian candidate - a bogus war hero under the control of billionaire George Soros - just as Bush's one-time Republican rival, Senator John McCain, had been smeared four years ago as another such \"candidate\", brainwashed in a North Vietnam POW camp. All of the candidates had their Manchurian aspect - not least the third-party perennial, Ralph Nader, who, as several commentators pointed out, seemed determined to ensure Bush's victory and thus a pro-corporate agenda he ostensibly opposes, in a second consecutive election. </p> <p>Demme's movie, too, has been attacked as a \"Naderite yelp against Democratic backsliding\" (The New Republic ), as well as characterised, more approvingly, \"the most extravagantly Chomskyite movie Hollywood has ever made\" (In These Times). Significantly, its release coincides with the remarkable success, at least in New York's alt-film world, of the Canadian horror-doc The Corporation, which applies the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to demonstrate that corporations are by nature psychopathic - self-absorbed, irresponsible, manipulative and unable to empathise or feel remorse. </p> <p>There's no need for a Joe McCarthy-like demagogue in the new Manchurian Candidate . Demagoguery has been dispersed, institutionalised and built into the workings of the national entertainment state that has rationalised, if not replaced, the old American dream life. Paranoia, in the Manchurian remake, is blatantly orchestrated, with a steady background of terrorist and counter-terrorist chatter and a sense of constant surveillance. Patriotic pageantry is even more hysterical and Pavlovian than in the original - and, in the deployment of heroic New York City firefighters and Mount Rushmore, makes a reasonably accurate prediction of Republican campaign ads. </p> <p>These days, regime change through the strategic elimination of political leaders is no longer an issue, at least in the US. Nor is the construction of history's secret agent. A mysterious squarish bulge visible beneath President Bush's suit jacket during his first debate with John Kerry led to much media speculation that he was wired with some sort of radio receiver. Still, the most retrograde aspect of the new Candidate is the use of the old-fashioned Jos\u00e9 Delgado-type brain implants. </p> <p>As demonstrated by the terror alerts that have figured in the current presidential campaign, along with the new Department of Homeland Security's blandly issued threat of a cancelled election, it's not the assassins who are being programmed with sinister microchips - it is America's body politic. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Manchurian Candidate is released on November 19. The Corporation is out now. J Hoberman is senior film critic at the Village Voice and author of The Dream Life: Movies, Media and the Mythology of the Sixties (The New Press).</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this month, the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, Trevor Phillips, spoke on the BBC of something he called \"passive apartheid\", which existed in the British countryside. According to Phillips, it arose out of a kind of \"mutual incomprehension\" between white and non-white people when they encountered each other outside the much more racially diverse cities. He said: \"This [the passive apartheid] is not by anybody's will: there is no law and I doubt if anyone in the countryside wants to keep people out. But I think what we are seeing is a gradual drift towards a difficult situation in which people from ethnic minorities feel uncomfortable.\" </p> <p>I don't know what evidence Phillips has for his \"gradual drift towards a difficult situation\". In Britain, black and brown people have always been much sparser outside towns than inside them. Today, according to a recent report in the Guardian, the average for non-white citizens in the UK as a whole is one in 12 of the population; in southwest England they number only one in 85. Patterns of original settlement and kinship and occupation would explain most of that - and also, perhaps, that historic English dream of \"living in the country\" which is probably more potent among the white middle class (who have the money to achieve it) than among any other group, so that the movement from city to country is predominantly a white one. Rarity always commands attention. A man of Nigerian ancestry is bound to attract more curiosity in Devon than in Dalston Junction. But will there be more hostility towards him? Or any more now than before? </p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, I was married to a non-white woman. I can't and won't speak for her experience of racial abuse or racial difference. All I can say is that, as she related it, in London it was sometimes funny (drunken Irishman on the pavement outside Finsbury Park tube: \"Now what time would it be where you come from?\") and that, for me, the worst of it came in a field in Fife where a group of boys shouted at her to \"go back to the trees\". I hadn't expected it in the place I grew up, which was foolish of me. Perhaps, had my then wife appeared in that field in the 1950s, I would have been among a group of similar boys and shouted the same thing. I don't think so, but I don't know. </p> <p>One of the interesting gaps in documentary literature and documentary film is how \"ordinary\" British people have reacted to migrants, soon to be fellow-citizens, of a different colour. Thanks to a range of writers and diarists - from William Hickey to George Orwell - we know about white reaction to non-whites in their native places. Thanks to another range - from Indian travellers in the 1800s up to Niraud Chaudhuri, Naipaul, Rushdie and Andrea Levy - we have an idea of how non-whites found Britain. But the encounter inside this country from the white side is very rarely described. Perhaps it doesn't need to be and would be too shaming to read. Perhaps it really is just a matter of Enoch Powell, NO DOGS NO BLACKS on the boarding house door, and grainy footage of the Empire Windrush. My own feeling is that it is more complicated than that. </p> <p>The first black person I ever saw was on the Piccadilly line, somewhere near Hammersmith (I saw a rare London Transport steam engine outside the window just before or after) in 1951 when I was six. We'd come to stay with my granny and to see the Festival of Britain. The black man, who wore a smart suit, sat across the train's aisle and smiled at me. I think my father encouraged me to smile back. Perhaps I had been staring. That was that. </p> <p>The next year we moved to the village in Scotland where, so many years later, the boys in the field saw a brown woman and told her to get back to the trees. The term \"Scottish village\" has many connotations, almost all of them homely and almost all of them wrong. My village had been thoroughly mixed up by the conflicts of the 20th century. Nearby, there was a naval dockyard and an airbase or two, while the village itself held a small army barracks and a Royal Navy signal station. Many of the children I knew were raised - a puzzle to me then - by their grandparents. </p> <p>Here in the flat across the street from us lived my second black, or at least non-white, man: \"The Raja\". What did we know of him? That he was brown and robust-looking and cheery; that for a living he caught and cast off the ropes at the pier where the ferryboats came and went; that he lived with his daughter, Maggie (our popular postwoman), and his Cornish son-in-law Norman, and his grand-daughter, May, who played in the street with us. Eventually we also knew that he was from Malaya and had lived first in the village on the seashore in the \"Nestl\u00e9 Milk Huts\", so-called because their roofs were made of old enamel adverts for that brand of chocolate. </p> <p>The Raja was a very friendly man, especially towards ferry-boat passengers who in the summer included foreign tourists (it was said that he'd been round the world twice and could speak five languages), and it was thanks to his gifts in this department that our little street witnessed the most exciting event in its history. The Raja had encountered Malay's police pipe band on the ferryboat - it was around the time of the Edinburgh Tattoo - and arranged that the entire outfit, drummers and pipers and pipe-major and cooks, came to his very small council flat for lunch. I can still remember the big shining pans of rice, and uniformed bandsmen balancing plates of curry and trying to find somewhere to sit in the front garden. </p> <p>This week, thinking of Phillips's \"passive apartheid\", I rang May (who still lives in the same house) to ask about her grandfather and what it was like to grow up not-quite-white in a Scottish village 50 years ago. She spelt out his real name for me, Raja Mahamet, and said that he had come to England, perhaps to study medicine, but there married a girl from Norwich, which caused his family to disinherit him. Then he began to look for work. He'd sometimes spoken of a day or two he spent on the Jarrow march. </p> <p>She remembered his precepts: how courtesy was vital at all times and how she must forgive and forget insults because they came out of ignorance. Insults such as? \"I did get upset at times at school when people said: 'You're a Chinkie!' or 'Your grandpa's black!'\" </p> <p>I grew up in the same street as she and had either never known of these insults or had forgotten I'd heard them. Perhaps this is what Phillips means by \"passive apartheid\" - too little, rather than too much, curiosity about the others in your midst, so that their individual humanity never emerges and they remain strangers known by their colour. What is harder to believe is that it's worse now than it was, or threatening to become so. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ian Jack is editor of Granta</p>",
  "<p>Beeban Kidron is a one-woman brass band - all eyebrows and fiery gestures and sudden changes in tempo and delivery. Italics don't even begin to do justice to her emphases, her passion. Everything she says is delivered with more than conviction, with complete credibility. When I say brass band, I don't mean noisy - she isn't - I just mean that she is the kind of person you'd follow into combat, or down a mine.</p> <p>And that's one of a whole load of reasons that you wouldn't expect Kidron to have directed the second Bridget Jones movie, The Edge Of Reason. From the closing credits of the original, the sequel seemed all stitched up. With the cast assembled, the director a buddy of the writer, the writer a global success story, and blockbuster status for all of them, you'd think they'd just roll up their sleeves and start over again. Instead, they drafted in a director with the most flawless feminist pedigree, along with a history of political activism both inside film- making and out. </p> <p>Besides wondering what made them choose Kidron, more to the point is what made her choose them? Well, she has this pitch of persuasiveness that seems as if it comes from spending a working life trying to persuade people to part with 20 quid to make something that sounds unwatchable but is actually brilliant. What do you do with all that spare charisma when there's more money than you could shake a stick at and the film is so eagerly awaited that it probably doesn't even need adverts? This sounds as if I'm accusing Kidron of selling out, which I'm not, but if I were, she has rather a wry and unarguable answer to that one: \"From the moment I went to Hollywood for the first time, I was accused by various people of selling out. So I feel I've done my sell-out films already. I've sold everything! I've sold every piece of soul I ever had!\" </p> <p>Kidron's filmography is surprisingly short, considering how recognisable her name is - you always expect a director (or an actor, or anyone involved in the business, really) to have done two films, to every one you've heard of, that were forgettable, or rubbish, or straight-to-video. Kidron has, mostly, only done ones you remember: Carry Greenham Home, the documentary she made with Amanda Richardson about the women's peace camp at Greenham Common, which she began when she was 20; Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, the television adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's novel that swept the Baftas of 1991; Vroom, the above-average Brit flick that featured breakthrough performances by David Thewlis and Clive Owen; Antonia And Jane, the female buddy movie starring Imelda Staunton and Saskia Reeves; Hookers Hustlers Pimps And Their Johns, a startling documentary with a self-explanatory title; and Murder, the 2002 TV drama starring Julie Walters. Indeed, the only spider in the ice cream is the disappointing Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert clone To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, in which she got Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes into frocks. </p> <p>And that's pretty much it. Kidron nods vigorously, mercifully unoffended by what is essentially a really rude question. \"Yes, I wish I'd made more films. I wish it was easier to make films I'm interested in. My taste is very, very broad, but the quality, I'm only interested in a certain level of quality. And Bridget is part of that, for me. I think you can sort of look at this slightly odd CV that I have and see where Bridget fits in. It's been the Antonia [And] Jane, To Wong Foo strand, the more comedic of my work. I think it is a great gift to make people laugh, and it shouldn't be underestimated. I mean, I don't mean my great gift [laugh, eyes, fireworks], I mean a great gift in the community.\" </p> <p>Bridget is a very funny film. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who has been billed since Nurse Irene as the comic actress of her generation, does more than flex her comedy muscles. Here, she flexes them, and then picks up a huge big truck. You could say that about the first one, too, but there's more meat to her this time (no, no, I don't mean the weight-gain thing; the scale of weight-gain has remained the same). Hugh Grant, given more of an unambiguous bad guy role, is able to do comic malevolence in a way that few directors allow him, since they never want to waste his peerless romantic hero shtick. The smaller roles are way more carefully tended, and laugh-out-loud jokes are slipped in at the end of scenes, rather than announced with a big fanfare - this film has enough funny gags that it can sprinkle them about like hundreds and thousands. </p> <p>Kidron is naturally keen to give all the credit to Helen Fielding, Zellweger (\"She's actually a thoroughbred actress, is what she is\") and Grant. She goes so far as to have a bit of a moment over Colin Firth: \"I've walked down the street with Madonna, and I've walked down the street with Colin Firth, and it was a little bit more ... with Madonna they were a little rougher, but they were all there for Colin. It was amazing. Women adore him. They swoon. Anyway. Stop. If I say anything stupid, you have to cut it out.\" </p> <p>But aside from how well the others did their jobs, it's clear she did hers so well because she attacked it with absolute fervour. This wasn't a film taken on by someone who needed a new bathroom - put it that way. Kidron isn't a trainspottery Bridget Jones aficionado - she makes no claims to being the first to discover how funny it was, or being able to quote whole chapters of the oeuvre, but equally there's no part of her that feels as if she's ... not dumbing down, exactly, more unfeministing-down (can I get away with that?) in having taken on the project. \"I remember when the first one came out, and this guy on the telly attacked the movie on really pseudo-feminist grounds, you know, that it makes women stupid, it saw them only in relation to their men. I remember turning on him and saying, 'You're wrong. You're wrong. No one thinks of Laurel and Hardy as stupid, or Buster Keaton as denigrated. It is a metaphor for how we feel, it's a realisation of our fear of how we're going to behave.'\" </p> <p>She makes no outlandish claims for the importance of this film, but does insist that, in its way, it is radical. It's radical because its heroine isn't perfect, she isn't graceful, she isn't chaste or even particularly monogamous, and she isn't thin. That last is what everyone fixes on, but the rest is, in the context of what is expected of female leads by mainstream Hollywood and so many other branches of the media aimed at women, just as important. \"Now, I don't say it's broadly radical, and I absolutely can see how you could put it in a cultural context and say it is shoring up a number of things, heterosexual, blah, but you know what? The world is so far gone, and women are under such a lot of pressure ... You have a choice in the mainstream media of saying a little thing to a lot of people, or a great many things to many fewer people. It is very, very rare that you can do both.\" </p> <p>Kidron views it not with derision but with amused bafflement. \"I had breakfast with one of my more intellectual friends - I mean, properly intellectual, a very, very famous man in the world. I was in the middle of shooting, one day off, and he said, 'And how is she doing? I hear she ate 13 doughnuts in one day.' I was absolutely stunned. And I went, 'Antony Gormley O ... B ... E! I cannot believe you are concerning yourself with what Ren\u00e9e Zellweger has for breakfast!' I was flabbergasted.\" </p> <p>You'd think, with a sequel, that people would get bored with such a surface detail, but no - everyone still talks about Zellweger's phenomenal eatathon as though she'd been forced to give away a kidney for the sake of her art. I suppose this reinforces Kidron's point that, at this particular time in the trajectory of images of femininity, a message as simple as \"It's OK not to be skinny\" is radical, and will continue to be, until more people make it, and more often. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it's probably still not the film Kidron thought she'd be making 20-ish years ago when her first film, Carry Greenham Home, came out. She was still at film school when she made it - indeed, had just gone along for the weekend to try and figure out how to use a camera and ended up staying a year. \"Literally, night and day, night and day. I had my 21st birthday at Greenham, by the fire, chanting. It was one of my better birthdays. And I think I had a New Year's Eve going over the perimeter fence. It was one of my better New Year's Eves.\" </p> <p>Kidron is uncharacteristically not-that-modest about this venture, which I think is because it's so long ago that she sees it as part of the time, rather than part of her work: \"It was a huge, huge act of protest and politics and rage at what was going on in the world. But it was still funny, it was still touching, it was still a version of a documentary, and that's always been my interest. How do you speak to the many? And how are you - not in a compromising sense, but in the most positive possible sense - the acceptable face of what they do not understand or will not tolerate?\" </p> <p>Having said that, she doesn't hold much with self-effacement, certainly not the half-meant, simpering kind, and I think it would be impossible to have been politicised in the era that she was, without winding up way too bolshie and full of vim to affect a \"don't mind me\" stance about anything. Besides which, it is a brilliant documentary, vivid and funny and sincere to a degree that is actually a bit depressing, since it reminds you that the most you ever see about important protests now is when Ali G goes down to take the piss out of them and ask why they don't have more baths. It reminds you, also, how polarised people used to be about things like this, how a great many people saw nothing at all worthwhile, or worth listening to, about peace protesters, and normal-looking Greenham locals went round with angry faces and badges saying RAGE (Residents Against Greenham ... I can't remember what the E stood for. Maybe eejits). </p> <p>As distinct, easily, were the battle lines drawn around Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. It's easy to forget the context of this, along with the reaction it drew. Plus, the tragic early death of its lead actress Charlotte Coleman bathes it in nostalgia, rather, and puts it on a cultural par with the children's television series Marmalade - something of which everyone was immediately fond, and remains so. </p> <p>But this was a time when there were only four channels, and everyone was watching one of them, and the only way to opt out of cultural debate would be not to watch telly at all (whereas now you can just watch Friends all the time). It was also long before the first lesbian kiss on Brookside, before gayness was even a twinkle in the eye of EastEnders, and a good 10 years before Coronation Street caught up. The first scene of same-sex intimacy on British television is what gave it its shock value, and Mary Whitehouse wasn't alone in her crazy talk of depravity. The BBC wasn't too keen on it, either. \"I remember that when the executive producer, I can't remember his name, Michael something ... but not Grade [eyes flash with prospect of amusing identity mistake]. Definitely not Grade. But anyway, he stood up, and he said, 'Well, that's not very BBC, is it?' And he walked out, and that was his contribution.\" </p> <p>It was phenomenally successful in the mainstream, with all the Baftas and such, and also won every gay and lesbian film-making award going, but Kidron's standing as a resolutely radical and campaigning director, on this front, is complicated. To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar, starring all those quintessentially straight big shots, garnered some serious-minded critiques for not going far enough, not using any gay actors, not showing the reality of being a transvestite in small-town America, all those boxes it would have ticked if its aim had been exclusively political. </p> <p>As is probably clear by now, Kidron would rather be somewhat political and somewhat mainstream than very political and not mainstream at all. She talks about films \"doing their job in the world\". When she pantomimishly claimed to have sold every bit of soul she had, it was underpinned by a more serious rejection of the academic/arthouse path through culture, which guards its purity very closely but doesn't reach an awfully large audience. \"All these things are cultural conversations. You want to be part of it, you don't want to leave it to everyone else. 'Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I'm doing something terribly right on.' I'm not that interested in that. I think we have a broader palette.\" </p> <p>In terms of her personal politics, she says she's the kind of person who seems terribly political to the outside world, but who, in the context of her Marxist upbringing, isn't political at all. She isn't the same creature, politically, as the one who made Carry Greenham Home. \"The world has changed so much. And my relationship with it has changed so much. I'm older, and I'm a mother, and I've been through many and various life experiences. I lost my father. I'm even married, which I never thought I would be. There are many, many things that have changed my relationship with the world.\" </p> <p>And, for half a second, that all sounds like a roundabout way of saying that hoary old Churchill thing about being a socialist until you're 30 because you've a heart, and a conservative afterwards because you've a brain. But, of course, that's not what she's saying at all. \"I've been very encouraged by the numbers of young people gathering around the anti-globalisation thing. It's not all thought through, but it's pretty anarchic and it's pretty fantastic and it's pretty loud. And the huge movement against the war, which, of course, should have been heeded, and which, of course, Blair is a criminal to have turned his back on, is also encouraging because, in this time in which we lack community and lack a structure and lack a political education, here is the largest street demonstration in history. So you've always got to look to the facts ... there are very stupid movies, with very stupid women in them, but there are also very intelligent movies, with very intelligent women in them. There is despair about international politics and a despair about domestic politics, but there is a proper, vibrant opposition, and it's not around traditional party lines.\" </p> <p>I love the way women in films keep bobbing back up as she talks, regardless of the subject; it's a million miles away from the crass, keep-plugging-the-product stuff you get sometimes when you try to draw a filmy person away from the film. A project can consume terribly energetic, terribly passionate people to the extent that all conversations dovetail with it, at least for a time. Kidron had Bridget Jones absolutely right - it is not the most groundbreaking film ever made, but it breaks enough ground, and it's all done so expertly and charmingly you wouldn't want it to go further. </p> <p>\"So long as I haven't dropped the crown jewels, so long as people think that their Bridget is safe, so long as people know it's still OK to have a big arse and say the wrong thing and not be able to live up to this or that - all these expectations of what being a woman is - and they will still find romance and love and happiness, and all the things you want in a good life, then I've done my job. And maybe if the world was some other world, then it wouldn't be enough, but, right now, I think it's important. I don't want to be grand, but I think it's a little bit important.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason is released on November 12.</p>",
  "<p>Camera retailer Jessops managed to get its flotation away yesterday but only after dropping the price of its shares, underlining the unsettled conditions of the stock market for new issues. </p> <p>Jessops, founded almost 70 years ago, saw its shares start trading at 155p, compared with its original price range of 185p-220p a share. At the start of trading Jessops was valued at \u00a3160m, almost \u00a330m less than its advisers originally hoped. </p> <p>The stock failed to develop any serious following and the shares finished their first day of dealings at 150p. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the company put on a brave face, saying: \"The objective of the initial public offering was to raise money to pay down the debt and it has done that. But it does show that the IPO market is not wholly open to new issues at this point.\" </p> <p>Jessops raised \u00a396.8m to pay off the majority of its \u00a3130m debt while its venture capital backer, ABN Amro Capital, was able to raise about \u00a315m by selling some of its stake. It will retain 18% of the business, which it cannot sell for at least six months. </p> <p>The company's current and former management sold about \u00a38m worth of stock yesterday, but its executive directors are not believed to have dumped a lot of stock in the market. About 20 managers will retain about 6% of the business. </p> <p>Jessops is the latest entrant that has been forced to rein back its valuation in the face of investor uncertainty about stock market performance. Over the summer Sir Richard Branson was forced to slash the price of his mobile phone business, Virgin Mobile, to get the business on to the public markets. </p> <p>Market watchers hoped the appetite for new issues had recovered after Admiral Group, the insurance firm, got its flotation away successfully late last month. </p> <p>But this week shares in Spanish toll road operator Cintra fell on their first day of dealings despite being sold to investors at the bottom end of their proposed price range. </p> <p>Jessops, which has 263 stores across the country, started trading in 1935 and was a family-run business until a management buyout in 1996. ABN Amro bought the business from the buyout's backer, Bridgepoint Capital, in October 2002. </p> <p>The company estimates it made earnings before financial charges of \u00a319.5m last year, compared with \u00a317.1m in the previous year, on turnover of \u00a3319m. </p> <p>The company, which is hoping to capitalise on the growing demand from consumers for digital cameras, said like-for-like sales over that period increased just over 6%. </p> <p>Derek Hine, chief executive, said: \"We are delighted that the global offer has been successfully completed despite the uncertain stock market conditions for IPOs.\"</p>",
  "Lisa Johnson made the same trip I did. But while it has taken me a month to get from Boston she and her husband drove down in just three days. It was 1980, she was 28 and he had landed a job in the booming oil industry in Midland. <p>\"I thought I was coming for one year,\" she says. \"That was the agreement. All the way through Texas I was fine. But when I came into town and saw all the oil tanks I just started crying. It was pretty ugly and you could smell the oil.\" </p> <p>If you cannot find a way to love oil - the industry that produces it, the environment that it scars and the money that it makes - then you will probably never find a way to love Midland. </p> <p>Rising from the West Texas desert like a small Gulf state, your entrance to the town is flanked by restless, bobbing, pumping jacks and vast shrubland pockmarked with derricks. </p> <p>Along with Odessa, it's poorer, even uglier sister city 16 miles away, Midland sits in the heart of the Permian Basin - a 1000-mile platform of sediment and salt with a slab of rock on top that is home to one fifth of the country's oil reserves. Between them they boast more than 2,000 firms involved in the oil and gas industry. </p> <p>And according to United States president, George Bush, if you don't find a way to appreciate Midland then you will struggle to find a way to appreciate him. </p> <p>\"I don't know what percentage of me is Midland,\" he once said in an interview, \"but I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland and the attitude of Midland.\" </p> <p>The percentage matters. Mr Bush was not born here but in New Haven, Connecticut. Nor does he live here now. When he is not in Washington DC, his home is 330 miles away on a ranch in Crawford, also in Texas. </p> <p>In fact, his relationship to Midland is quite episodic. He came here as a two-year-old, attended the Sam Houston elementary school and then San Jacinto junior high (both state schools). He returned 16 years later in 1975 and married a local woman, Laura Welch. In 1987 he left to help his father on his presidential campaign and has only returned to campaign and visit friends and in-laws. </p> <p>\"He was viewed as an outsider,\" says Jim Brown, a geologist who did business with Mr Bush in the 80s. \"Midland has embraced him as a native son now because he was governor of Texas and now he's president. But back then, to the few people who knew who he was, he was just a rich Yankee kid.\" </p> <p>His Democratic challenger, John Kerry, has a stronger claim to Boston, where he has lived and worked since he returned from the Vietnam war. But while Mr Kerry holds Boston at arms length, lamenting the fact that he \"moved around a lot\" as a child, Mr Bush holds Midland in a bear hug. </p> <p>He has written the city into his personal story as though its mores were seared into his soul. \"There's a West Texas populist streak in me and it irritates me when people come out to Midland and look at my friends with the utmost disdain,\" he told Texas Monthly. When he dies, he says, he wants to be buried in Midland. </p> <p>To his critics these are just more examples of Mr Bush's bid to shed his blueblood background. In 1978 the Democrat Kent Hance inflicted the only electoral defeat Mr Bush has ever suffered, largely by portraying him as a carpet-bagging, Ivy League Yankee. </p> <p>Mr Bush learned his lesson well. But Mr Bush certainly has an emotional claim to the place. Midland is where Mr Bush found a wife, God and gave up the bottle. </p> <p>In 1969 the cultural geographer DW Meinig described Midland as \"the purest example of white Anglo Saxon Protestant culture in Texas\". One of the last cities in the country to desegregate its elementary schools, today it is almost 40% black and Hispanic. </p> <p>But while the colour of the inhabitants may have changed, many of its customs have not. On Friday nights thousands pack the local Grande stadium for high school football. On Sunday mornings they go to church. It's a no-nonsense place where, during the 80s, business was often concluded on a handshake. \"People here are generally friendly,\" says John Nute, who runs a cafe in Wall Street. \"But there's an edge to that. One of the first questions you're asked when you come here is, what church do you go to? If you're answer is one they don't like then you never see them again.\" </p> <p>Oil and money may dominate, but one in eight of the city lives in poverty, most of them quite literally on the wrong side of the rail tracks. \"I doubt he even knew those places existed,\" says Midge Erskine, who knew Laura Bush's mother. \"It's a very segregated town. Over the years the town's ambivalent self-regard has been reflected in its changing slogans. They have included: \"Midland: In the Middle of Somewhere\"; \"Midland: Most Ambitious City Between the Oceans\"; and recently, \"The Sky's The Limit\" - a slogan from the 70s when the oil prices were so high that loan officers needed permission to turn you down - has been revived after Mr Bush said it encapsulated the Midland he knew. It's not difficult to see why Mr Bush would want to mythologise both the town and himself in this way. </p> <p>What is more baffling is that he has managed to get away with it, given that Midland was the site of his most conspicuous failures to date. </p> <p>He set up an oil business, Arbusto, which failed. He ran to represent the area in Congress and lost. By all accounts he had plenty of chances, did not work hard and never succeeded at anything much. \"He used to come into meetings still hung over and you'd see him fall asleep,\" says Mr Brown. \"Then when it was over he'd kind of jolt up and walk out with his team.\" </p> <p>But the nature of each setback and the manner in which he recovered are themselves revealing. Mr Bush is no self-made man. His father arrived in the early 50s and used the finance capital from his family to make millions. </p> <p>When Mr Bush arrived as a young man, 20 years later, his father was a former Congressman and ambassador, soon to become the vice-president. And in Midland connections are everything. \"If a Harvard MBA came to Midland without connections he wouldn't be able to raise the kind of money Bush did,\" says Mr Rosen. </p> <p>But while connections could provide Mr Bush with the money he needed it was not enough to guarantee him success. His father's picture hangs in the Petroleum Museum's hall of fame, but his will not be there any time soon. </p> <p>Mr Brown says Mr Bush's plans were flawed because they were based on \"poor science\". But the firm Mr Brown worked for invested in the projects anyway. </p> <p>\"It was a way of funnelling money to the Bushes without looking like it. His expertise was socialising.\" </p> <p>What is most remarkable about Mr Bush's relationship with Midland is that, despite the fact the he achieved so little, drank so much, lost an election and a lot of other people's money, pretty much everybody liked him. </p> <p>\"You never walked away from George Bush thinking he was a rotten individual,\" says Mr Brown. \"You thought he was your friend, your pal, your chum.\" </p> <p>In other words Midlanders liked him, not because of what he had achieved, but regardless of what he had not achieved. On Tuesday we will see if America will feel the same way.</p>",

We were going to make it in England, ship it to Australia, put it on the back of a truck, and dump it in my home town, which is an extremely small, ultra-conservative place. It's now been turned into a rehousing town for ex-cons who want to go straight, only nobody has gone straight, and it's turned into this strange lawless place,\" he explains, exhaling a lungful of smoke. \"If they don't accept it we were just going to drive it out to the desert and dump it somewhere, Planet Of The Apes style.\" </p> <p>Nick Cave, a source of civic pride? Is he serious? Apparently so, although his interviews often have a casual relationship with the truth. In the past he's told reporters that he was born with a tail, and now he's insisting that at sound-check they rocked. In a progressive way. \"It's one of my darkest secrets, that I do know a lot about prog rock. Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, Moody Blues, all that stuff. We do a mean version of Locomotive Breath.\" </p> <p>Since Nick's the one supplying the information, it's difficult to know when you're being led gently up the garden path. \"I'm Australian - even we don't know when we're joking and when we're not.\" Quizzed separately, the rest of the band back his spectacularly unlikely claim. </p> <p>The band are often portrayed as being in bad need of a good laugh, but despite an obdurate refusal to look on the bright side, as with Leonard Cohen's output, there's a streak of gallows humour running through Cave's work. Broadly speaking, he writes upbeat songs about death and miserable ones about love. Anyone who duets with Kylie and sings about caving her head in with a rock has an interesting funny bone. Then there's the comic-opera campness of the Murder Ballads album, with a death count of 37. It has to be said, if you find yourself in a Nick Cave video, wear shoes you can run in and get out while you have the chance: it's unlikely to end well for you. </p> <p>The new album, Abattoir Blues/ The Lyre Of Orpheus, features visions of hell, of course, but also love songs and pastoral imagery alongside black humour. A double album, it's the first without guitarist Blixa Bargeld, and is their fastest selling record to date. A \"micro-Seeds\" consisting of Jim Sclavunos, Martyn P Casey and Warren Ellis decamped to Paris to help with the writing. \"There were certain power-driven songs I wanted to do that I had in my head, but they needed other people to get them to work and, as it turned, out it was a fruitful thing to do.\" </p> <p>Cave has a slight punching-the-clock approach to interviews, totally at odds with his demeanour before and after. He is a musician who enjoys only the work, and not the self-promotion that comes with it. Armed with a roll-up, his words are chosen painstakingly, in a way that suggests they may have been misconstrued in the past. This reticence is matched by his profound distaste for the music industry's celebration of itself. </p> <p>When offered an MTV award, he was not so much uncomfortable as utterly demoralised, declining to \"harness my muse to this tumbrel, this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes\". Adverts are unconscionable to him, a transgression he seems to regard as being on a par with putting cats in the microwave or murdering children. When Gap approached him, he responded with another letter: \"Dear Gap, I might put on a pair of your jeans if you were to pay me $1bn, but even then I would have serious reservations.\" </p> <p>His self-destructive past is well documented. In the late 1970s he was an art student playing in the celebrated but nihilistic band the Birthday Party, which he remembers as being \"in a total state of disgrace\". He became addicted to heroin and his habit continued throughout the 1980s and much of the 1990s when, in the early days especially, he often looked like something the Grim Reaper threw back. Having cleaned up when he met his wife, Vivienne Westwood model Susie Bick, with whom he has twins, he now leads an almost comically respectable family life, and is widely regarded as one of the finest literary songwriters around. \"I'm a non-story,\" he claims, slightly disingenuously. \"I'm happily married, with kids, I go to the office, and I work nine to five.\" </p> <p>Right now, Nick wants to go sightseeing. Folded into a car, he requests Finnish folk songs from the driver, threatening to sing some himself and chats about politics and films. Nick's image of a spectral figure detached from modern life is not entirely accurate; he has little time for the current music scene, and doesn't watch TV, but he reads a newspaper, and knows what's happening in the world. The residents of Porvoo, a low-rise hamlet of ancient wooden houses and antique shops, are not sure what to make of the rake-thin man with jet-black hair and piercing blue eyes striding around purposefully. A sleepy, faintly forlorn place, like an out-of-season theme park, its residents stare with who-let-him-out-of-the-house looks. Some children even salute. He seems perfectly at ease with its Scandinavian oddness, and heads off for lunch at a snail restaurant. </p> <p>The band love to eat. You name it, they've eaten it. Gathered round a dinner table after the show, they order their food carefully, trading appetisers and discussing local delicacies reindeer and bear along with kangaroo and snake. They quite literally love their grub. \"Have you ever eaten insects?\" Warren ups the ante. \"I've had witchetty grubs,\" Nick enthuses gamely. </p> <p>The \"micro-Seeds\" are a robustly congenial cabal, despite a reputation for tortured intensity. Dressed way past the nines in their trademark gangster-chic suits and colourful shirts, their snap-crackle dialogue gives them a certain Reservoir Dogs flavour - like the characters, you sense they'd all want to be Mr Black - and the results are very entertaining indeed. Topics covered include what to say to the Crown Prince and Princess of Norway, who came backstage after a recent show, acceptable stage garb for their upcoming tour (suits of course, but Nick wants sequins, no less) and merchandising (Nick proposes a Lyre Of Orpheus tea towel). </p> <p>This easy camaraderie goes some way towards explaining their longevity. It takes dedication to keep a band together for 20 years, nearly three times as long as the Beatles. Especially when you consider they all have their own separate musical projects, along with the sheer impracticality of being scattered across three continents. As Jim puts it, \"Fuck Benetton, we were global before it was fashionable.\" Nick thinks it's due to their work ethic: \"We are men, we wear suits and we go to work.\" </p> <p>In any case, it is the ace up the band's sleeve. As the audience shouts out requests during their live show the following day, it's obvious that, like Nick's heroes Elvis and Bob Dylan, they really do have lots and lots of songs. To have this kind of repertory you have to have been around a while. And they're not getting off the stage until they're good and ready. </p> <p>\"The fact that you're getting older is the interesting thing. Obviously, it involves a series of small humiliations as you go along. It's admirable if you can suffer that stuff and be dignified about it at the same time.\" This is easier said than done. Earlier, in a mesmerisingly awkward TV interview, Nick was presented with a pair of orange gumboots. \"The whole thing was to see my response to that. I later found out the theme of this show was sexuality, which I wasn't told, so I'm left sitting there with a pair of orange gumboots in my hand. This is a sort of metaphor for my position in rock music.\" He may belong outside of rock, of celebrity, but all things considered, it's not a bad gig being Nick Cave. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds' UK tour begins on Wednesday</p>",
  "Plenty of Americans believe it is none of our business whom they elect as their leader on Tuesday. But there are two underlying reasons why any presidential election matters to the rest of the world. The first concerns America's power. There is no nation in the history of the planet whose strength and actions more directly affect the whole human race than the United States. To an unprecedented degree, America makes the world's weather. Its economic, military and cultural might shapes our lives. If America goes to war, we are all embroiled, as the events of the past three years have certainly shown. If the American economy booms or busts, then ours follows suit. If America spurns global agreements on climate change, the whole planet is more vulnerable. Even our domestic politics are shaped by theirs, as the last three years have again dramatically proved. We may not have a vote, but our interests are at stake on November 2, as surely as if we lived in Ohio, Oklahoma or Oregon ourselves. <p>The second reason, more controversially for some, concerns America's example. There has never been a nation like the United States. Its creation was, at least arguably, the single greatest constitutional achievement of mankind in the last millennium. From the earliest days until now, the eyes of all people have indeed been upon America, just as John Winthrop claimed four centuries ago. We can debate whether the greatest of all US presidents was right to see America as \"the last best hope of mankind\". But it is a matter of fact that successive generations on every continent have shared Abraham Lincoln's optimism about his homeland, that they have been inspired by American opportunity and freedom, and that new generations continue to be so. Few nations may have been so fundamentally shaped by racial injustice as the US was, but none in the history of the world has ultimately made a greater success of mass migration and of multi-cultural life either. Anti-Americanism may be more rife than ever in many parts of our world, but even where it is strongest it is a matter of record that millions of people in these very same societies admire America above all other nations. </p> <p>Since at least 1945, when the United States played the decisive role in creating the United Nations, an American presidential election has always been the single most influential event in the global political cycle. No such election, though, has mattered as overwhelmingly and urgently as this one. Four years ago, George Bush was beaten in the popular vote nationwide, yet captured the presidency because of electoral abuse in Florida and a shoddy legal judgment by the nation's highest court. Ever since, far from governing in the unifying manner that would have been appropriate in the circumstances (and that he briefly promised), he has done the opposite. But if Mr Bush has been partisan and confrontational at home - over the federal budget, education, race, civil liberty, the environment and a host of other social and cultural issues - he has been every bit as partisan and confrontational abroad. The attack of September 11 2001, an event of historic seriousness, created an unprecedented outpouring of solidarity worldwide. Three years later, much of that solidarity has been squandered. This has happened largely as a result of a war on Iraq that was not just ill-prepared and ill-executed in its own terms but that also exemplified the administration's aggressive contempt towards other nations, with disastrous consequences that continue to this day. </p> <p>To adapt the words of Talleyrand, the Bush presidency has been not merely a crime but a mistake. Mr Bush has proved a terrifying failure in the world's most powerful office. He has made the world more angry, more dangerous and more divided - not less. This, above all, is why it matters to us, as it should to Americans, that John Kerry is elected on Tuesday. A safer world requires not just the example of American power but the power of American example. Mr Bush has done more to destroy America's good name in the world than any president in memory. Mr Kerry provides an opportunity to begin to repair the damage. It is as simple - and as important - as that.</p>",
  "Britons may be unknowingly buying diamonds mined in Sierra Leone, where profits are used to arm militias. <p>\"Conflict\" or \"blood\" diamonds bought by developed countries have funded guns for child soldiers, provided arms to fight UN peacekeeping forces and financed several African civil wars, according to Amnesty International. Research by the environment group Global Witness revealed that in the 1990s the Angolan rebel army Unita generated $3.7bn in six years largely by trading illegal gems.</p> <p>Almost two years after the industry agreed to a self-regulation system to prevent the trade in diamonds from regions of conflict, many jewellers are unable to assure customers that the gems they are buying do not come from conflict regions. </p> <p>Members of Amnesty International visited more than 330 British jewellers' stores to question them about their policy. Only 38% of salespeople said they had received training about conflict diamonds. Almost half of the retailers said they could not provide a copy of their policy on conflict diamonds; more than a fifth said they had no store policy.</p> <p>Leading British retailers Asprey, Theo Fennell and Debenhams did not respond to letters requesting written information about company policy. In the US Costco Wholesale Corporation, TJ Maxx and Kmart did not respond.</p> <p>The research by Global Witness shows the industry has\u00canot implemented a system of self-regulation agreed in January 2003. Under the Kimberley Process ? a scheme to banish conflict diamonds from the legal trade in rough diamonds ? commitments were made to introduce a code of conduct and to educate employees about the issue.</p> <p>The World Diamond Council has also proposed that the industry create a system of warranties for diamonds, under which all buyers and sellers of rough and polished diamonds must provide a warranty saying they have been bought from a legitimate source not involved in funding conflict.</p> <p>The findings, which include research from Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland, were presented at the World Diamond Congress in New York this month. Amnesty International and Global Witness have called on governments to intervene, asking for independent monitoring, rigorous auditing and inspections.</p> <p>The director of Amnesty International UK, Kate Allen, said the industry was not taking the issue seriously enough. \"The trade in conflict diamonds has fuelled protracted and bloody wars in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone, destroying nations and costing an estimated 3.7 million lives,\" she said.</p>",
  "It was the opening of Catch-22: love at first sight. Yossarian? Me. The Chaplain: a grungy hole of a baseball ground called Fenway Park. A chilly Boston night in April 1982, the Red Sox playing the Oakland A's managed by the somewhat recovering drunk, ex-Yankee Billy Martin. What was I doing there? No idea. <p>Cricket and football (our football) were my games and would stay that way, never mind that I was living in Boston. Every month my dad had taken me to Lords to see Middlesex - the Comptons, Freddie Titmus, Alan Moss - and I'd happily inhaled the mix of beer tankards and fresh-cut grass while Arthur Schama went blissfully to sleep as the county lost yet again to Sussex (Ted Dexter). In winters it was White Hart Lane - starting early - when Alf Ramsey played for them in his long baggy black shorts, and then into the glory glory years of Nicholson, Blanchflower, Mackay and the dashingly, undependable Greaves. So why would I want to waste my time watching glorified rounders in what looked like a terrible dump, its drab paint a bilious grey-green, and peeling, just like the girders on the elevated freeway? </p> <p>Because my friend John Clive had nagged and nagged and I had given in. He was an unlikely Sox fan himself: my colleague in the Harvard history department; biographer of Macaulay; originally Johan Kleiff from Jewish Berlin: big, round, soft and exuberant with dark-brown eyes, and a hoarse chuckle. He loved great historical writing, Apple Brown Betty (a pudding not a call girl) and the Red Sox. So (grudgingly bemused) I went along for the ride, all innocent of the imminent and irreversible Change in Life, the coup de foudre; the date with fate that was about to hit. </p> <p>My nose got it before the rest of me did. Walking among the mass of the Sox Nation converging on the ballpark, up Yawkey Way, the nose surrendered to the smell of Italian sausage and frying onion peddled from the street stalls. You eat them sandwiched in hot doughy rolls, with screaming yellow mustard dripping out the end, and we did. Holy shit, there was something in those sausages; something that obviously made people happy, for happy this crowd surely was, kids and grandpas; lots of loud Boston women with insecure dye jobs and square shoulders encased in warm-up jackets that had seen many years of heartache; dads with six-year-olds riding on their shoulders. A crowd pouring through the gates from tough Irish Southie, patrician Marblehead or, like us, from bosky Lexington. </p> <p>Inside, Fenway was unpromising: a mass scurrying up and down dark and dirty ramps; programmes hawked, the notorious horse-trough toilets already brimming horribly from hours of Yawkey Way beer. But then, the climb up the steps into ballpark heaven: a blaze of golden light; grass as damply brilliant and as soft as a meadow in County Donegal; men in blue-and-red jackets gently warming up; a thuck-thuck as the baseball hit the mitt; an ancient organ that sighed and groaned and wheezed and sang while welcoming us to the inner sanctum of the cathedral; an even more ancient announcer, the late, great Sherm Feller, who from the depths of his avuncular baritone declared, \"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Fenway Park\", and from the ladies and gentlemen and boys and girls a soft roar of mass pleasure that rippled round the stands, and my cricket-loving, football-doting self was a hopeless, helpless gonner; Middlesex and Spurs were yesterday's passions. This, I thought, as I improbably caught the bag of peanuts chucked at me from 15 feet by the vendor, was where I had to be. This was home. </p> <p>The Red Sox won that evening: veterans (as I rapidly learned) charging round the bases, such as \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski, a high-octane hulk; taciturn Jim Rice, the slugger leaping at the edge of the outfield to hoist in what seemed sure home runs; Dwight \"Dewey\" Evans, natty in his trim moustaches, an elegant stance at the plate, cracking line drives through the emerald grass. So we went home happy, but being the Red Sox Nation, morning-after moodiness replaced the brief euphoria. Catch-22 - we won, but actually we should have lost - began in earnest. There were anxieties about the veterans. How long could this bunch hack it? Was it Yaz's last hurrah? And indeed I had noticed the air of slightly decrepit gentility - like much of Boston - hanging over the team as they chawed their chewing tobacco. </p> <p>I had no idea, of course, what I'd got myself into. I was still clueless about recognising pitches, especially from the bleachers or the box seats way out behind third base; couldn't tell a cut fastball from a slider if they hit me in the face. (It takes time, but believe me, it repays study. Great pitchers can turn the ball in mid-air in ways that spin bowlers have scarcely dreamed of.) Much more ominously, I had no idea of the dreaded history: the feckless sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees by the owner Harry Frazee, reputedly to finance the Broadway musical No No Nanette; the ensuing \"Curse of the Bambino\"; the failure to win a World Series since the Kaiser hung up his helmet. </p> <p>I vaguely knew of the Yankees-Sox rivalry but - since the Bronx Bombers were themselves regularly bombing in the 1980s - who cared? I had no idea whatsoever of the saga of torment; the moments of deluded euphoria (Carleton Fisk hitting the walk-off homer in Game 6 of the 1976 series against Cincinnati) before the crushing putdown (the loss of same series in game 7); an epic of sustained pain that by comparison made the pecking of Prometheus look like a day at the beach. </p> <p>I would learn in the worst possible way: the notorious 1986 World Series against the New York Mets. In the American League Championship series (semi-finals to you lot) the Sox had come from a strike away from being eliminated by the California Angels, when a pitcher called Donnie Moore served a fat one over the plate to Dave \"Hendu\" Henderson who saw it coming with his name on it, grinned one of his gap-toothed grins and sent it away. Stuck with the stigma of being the \"goat\", poor Moore went into a depressive slide and committed suicide. We went into the World Series against the Mets high on confidence - we had the brilliant pitching duo of Roger Clemens and Bruce Hurst and some of those unbowed veteran hitters from the early 80s. One strike away from Winning It All in Game 6, a ball notoriously trickled through the open gate of Bill Buckner's bandy legs and the Mets came back from the grave. In Game 7 it was our hearts into which the stake was driven. </p> <p>Years - decades - of roller-coaster elation and despair followed. In the meantime I had done something unforgiveable, saddled my own two kids with this infatuated allegiance; taken them to Fenway, shoved peanuts and sausages into their faces, made them do the \"wave\"; embarrassed them with my roaring abuse of visiting Yanks; taught them (yes, I could do that now), the difference between the cut fastball and the slider; in short pretty much ruined their blameless lives. </p> <p>This came home to me in the worst possible way, almost exactly a year ago when I took my son, 18, and grown prematurely wise in Soxian pessimism - to Yankee stadium to see the seventh and deciding game of the American League Championship. Around the seventh inning, well up on the Yanks, our ace Pedro Martinez pitching, we dared a cautious smile of anticipation. The Yankee fans were leaving in depressed droves; those that weren't were scowling at us or hiding their faces in their hands. Then Martinez, kept in for an inning too long, suddenly folded, surrendering hits. Amidst pandemonium, the game tied, and then a homer by the aptly named Aaron Boone won it for the Evil Empire. My son's face was drained of colour but he was the grown-up attempting to console his unhinged father. So now you know why I was up at 4am on Thursday morning watching every last pitch of the game with St Louis online; now you can measure the combination of ecstatic disbelief and narcotic jubilation coursing through my veins as our ace closer Keith Foulke made the last out. </p> <p>A bit OTT? Absolutely not, my world-weary cricketing friends. Anything is possible in 2004: the trains will run on time; balmy breezes will drift over Wales in December; the lion will lie down with the lamb and, oh yes, a Red Sox fan will, come January, be sworn into office as the 44th President of the United States.</p>",
  "A former British army captain who claims to have worked with Winston Churchill on secret wartime operations has been found guilty of reworking a painting by another former employer, the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed. <p>John Peter Moore, a former private secretary to the artist, cut up a stolen 1969 Dal\u00ed painting, The Double Image of Gala, and used it to create what he claimed was a new Dal\u00ed, according to court documents cited by Spanish news agency Efe. </p> <p>The new picture, called Dal\u00ed Painting Gala, was placed on display in Moore's art gallery in Cadaqu\u00e9s in north-east Spain in 1999, but was taken away by the police, who also found 10,000 fake Dal\u00ed lithographs. </p> <p>Moore, now 85, was convicted together with his wife Catherine Perrot, of \"damaging the moral rights of the author\", the Gala-Salvador Dal\u00ed Foundation confirmed. </p> <p>The foundation, which owns Dal\u00ed's estate, said Moore and his wife would have to pay damages estimated at more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3700,000), costs, and an unspecified sum to restore the picture. </p> <p>\"This sets a very important precedent in the recognition and defence of the moral rights of artists,\" the foundation's statement said. </p> <p>How restoration will be achieved is impossible to say. </p> <p>A spokesman for the foundation said it had no photograph or technical details of the original work, which was stolen from the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1974. </p> <p>Valued at about $125,000 (\u00a368,000) in 1975, the picture was sought worldwide for many years by the FBI and Interpol. </p> <p>The conviction is a further bizarre twist in the story of Moore and the man who appointed him not only as his private secretary but also his personal \"defence minister\". </p> <p>Moore, who liked to be photographed petting his tame ocelot - an American wildcat - was a key member of Dal\u00ed's colourful entourage for 20 years. </p> <p>He was involved in many of the money-making schemes the artist was so fond off, including the mass-production of Dal\u00ed lithographs. </p> <p>Dal\u00ed's voracious appetite for money once led the French surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton to rework his name into the anagram \"avida dollars\". </p> <p>The painter added his signature to an estimated hundreds of thousands of lithographs churned out over the years. </p> <p>\"Each morning after breakfast I like to start the day by earning 20,000 dollars,\" he once said. </p> <p>The existence of several hundred thousand lithographs signed by Dal\u00ed has encouraged a flourishing, parallel global trade in fakes. </p> <p>Dal\u00ed died in 1989 of heart failure, leaving an estate estimated at $87.7m </p> <p>Dal\u00ed and Moore first met in Rome, where the latter arranged payment for a portrait of the British actor Lord Olivier which Dal\u00ed had painted in 1955. </p> <p>A Spanish court dropped a prosecution for dealing in fakes because of Moore's advanced age. He has denied the accusation. </p> <p>\"I have no need to make fakes,\" he told a Spanish radio station after the police raided his gallery and warehouses five years ago. </p> <p>\"I have all the original Dal\u00eds I could possibly want. This is all the result of envy,\" he said. </p> <p>Moore's wife, Catherine Perrot, told the Guardian yesterday that he would appeal.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's best new public building this year is ... a couple of miles of tarmac painted with dotted white lines. Congratulations to the A650 Bingley relief road. There was some spluttering into champagne glasses last night when the decision was announced to give the bypass the annual Prime Minister's Award - previously won by icons such as Tate Modern in London. </p> <p>\"Astonishing, amazing,\" said Tony Bosworth, transport campaigner for Friends of the Earth. \"The award this road deserves is for shortsighted planning. All it's done is destroy one of Britain's finest nature reserves and shift congestion a few miles down the Aire valley.\" </p> <p>But architects and planners largely welcomed the choice, the first non-building to win since Tony Blair invented the prize four years ago to raise the sights of public sector design and construction. </p> <p>\"This is an award for building, the verb, not buildings, the noun,\" said Paul Finch, head of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, which administers the scheme. </p> <p>\"The choice is refreshing. A road is a piece of construction which can affect far more people for good or ill than an individual building.\" </p> <p>The bypass, born in fierce controversy in 1976, when a public inquiry was aborted after fistfights, was one of three roads on the prime minister's 17-strong shortlist. </p> <p>Most of the other candidates were major buildings, but his blessing could have fallen on a coastal floodwall in Dorset, public lavatories in the New Forest or the bulldozing of part of Birmingham, which was entered as an example of \"heroic demolition\". </p> <p>One of last year's also-rans prepared the way for Bingley's victory - repairs to a stretch of the M1 which were carried out on time, to budget and without lane closures. </p> <p>Paul Watters, head of road policy at the AA Motoring Trust, said: \"Of course roadworks should qualify for the PM's award. You can build roads aesthetically or you can make a pig's ear of it. I don't want to mention Twyford Down, but ...\" </p> <p>The A650 beat the new Trafalgar Square in London and a hostel for eavesdroppers at GCHQ in Cheltenham. </p> <p>The road, which cost just under \u00a350m, also has a place in culture. It has finally been welcomed for bringing peace and charm back to Bingley's main street, where the novelist John Braine ran the library between writing Room at the Top and complaining about the traffic.</p>",

  "<p>Edinburgh side Hearts have confirmed that head coach Craig Levein is on the brink of a move to Leicester City to replace Micky Adams, who resigned last week. </p> <p>The 40-year-old has made up his mind to leave the Edinburgh club after a four-year spell in which he has established a reputation as one of Scotland's top coaches.</p> <p>Hearts yesterday turned down Leicester's request to speak to Levein, and the move has yet to be finalised as a compensation package has not been agreed.</p> <p>Levein is nonetheless preparing to travel down to the East Midlands to conclude a deal with the Foxes, who had identified him as their first choice to succeed Adams. Levein was at Hearts' Riccarton training ground today overseeing training while waiting for the green light from his employers.</p> <p>A Hearts spokesman said: \"We are still in discussions with Leicester over compensation.\" </p> <p>The former Scotland defender was to have met with prospective new Hearts owner Vladimir Romanov, the Lithuanian banker, last night to discuss plans for the future.</p> <p>But events had already overtaken that scenario as Levein had made up his mind to try to restore Leicester's Premiership's status and make his name in England. </p> <p>He is expected to take No2 Peter Houston with him and Levein's intention is to watch Leicester's Championship game at Cardiff tomorrow. Houston may stay on for a little longer however to oversee tomorrow's Tynecastle clash with Dundee.</p> <p>As a listed company, Hearts know they must make a statement to the Stock Exchange once a deal is concluded. Levein took over from Jim Jefferies in December 2000, with his predecessor having joined Bradford City - then in the Premiership - because of the Edinburgh club's money problems.</p> <p>Levein was able to make the club the most competitive outside the Old Firm despite having to shed big earners as Hearts' financial worries became so acute they decided to sell Tynecastle to wipe out debts of almost \u00a320million. That decision - which has yet to become reality - was bitterly opposed by a huge section of supporters, who vented their wrath on chief executive Chris Robinson. </p> <p>But Levein's reputation was not in the least tarnished by his association with an unpopular regime as he steered the club to third place finishes in the last two seasons. </p> <p>They have also reached the Uefa Cup group stages this season and will play Germans Schalke 04 next week, but by the time that game comes around Levein may already have taken charge of his first Leicester game at Crewe on Tuesday. </p> <p>Hearts fans had been hoping the arrival of Romanov, which is set to be completed on December 8 when he buys Robinson's 20% holding, would herald a great new era under Levein. Now they must hope his successor can also find a successful formula and many would back the appointment of Inverness manager John Robertson, who is one of Hearts' all-time greats. </p> <p>But Romanov may already have his own plans and was known to be intending to bring in Anatoly Byshovets above Levein as \"football consultant\". The former USSR player and coach could therefore take over the running of all team affairs.</p>",
  "<p>Jessops, the UK's largest photographic retailer, got its stock market flotation off the ground today - but at a far lower-than-expected price. </p> <p>The group unveiled plans for an initial public offering earlier this month, and subsequently indicated a price band of between 185p and 220p per share. Yet today it cut its flotation price to just 155p a share, following poor demand from investors.</p> <p>The price values the company at around \u00a3160m, compared with an anticipated price band of between \u00a3173m and \u00a3189m.</p> <p>Jessops said it had already raised \u00a3120m through the sale of 77.3m shares and that it would receive proceeds of around \u00a397m, which it will use to repay debt.</p> <p>Around three quarters of the outstanding 102.8m shares following the offer will be in public hands, it added. Today's dealings were conditional, meaning only institutional investors could buy shares. The offering will be available to the public in a week's time.</p> <p>\"We are delighted that the global offer has been successfully completed, despite the uncertain stock market conditions for IPOs,\" Jessops chief executive Derek Hine said. </p> <p>Mr Hine added that he believed investors shared the group's view that it was well-placed to profit from the growth of digital photography. Jessops, which employs around 2,800 staff , has been investing heavily in digital technology, amid forecasts the photographic market will grow by 23% to \u00a32.7bn over the next four years - with 76% of this in the digital sector. </p> <p>Although car insurer Admiral managed a successful listing last month, a flagging market for IPOs has forced a number of companies to shelve plans for offerings this year. Others, such as Virgin Mobile, have cut the price at which they sold their shares. </p> <p>Jessops, with 263 stores nationwide, was founded in 1935 and operated as a family business until July 1996 when it was acquired in a management buy-out. Its venture capitalist owner, ABN Amro Capital, then bought it in 2002, after an earlier attempt to float was thwarted by stock market conditions.</p> <p>Market sources said today that ABN was believed to have cashed in its holdings in the offer. Early this morning, Jessops shares were trading at 156.5p in conditional dealing.</p>",
  "<p>I entered the Frankfurt book fair with a map of Iraq as a brooch on my blouse. The spotlights dangling from the publishers' aisles were burning into contract paper, glossy posters and visitors' faces. The scent of smoky ink brought back memories of my late Scottish mother, a librarian in Edinburgh in the 1950s. She invited me to become a writer, and the Arab League invited the writer to Frankfurt. </p> <p>She took care of hundreds of books: dusted, archived, and cherished them, but she would never keep them at home. In Baghdad, she would proudly arrange her collection of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but she would never display novels on her shelves. Her philosophy was: \"Novels should be circulated among readers. We have to let go of them, to allow the stories to spread.\" Holding that thought, I searched for fellow novelists. </p> <p>The opening ceremony highlighted the importance of building a bridge between east and west. The speakers took turns: the German chancellor, the lady mayor of Frankfurt, the secretary general of the Arab League, the chief of the union of German publishers, and a representative of Naquib Mahfouz, the Nobel prize winner. </p> <p>First Lady Mubarak did not give a speech. Instead, she had a poster in the Egyptian pavilion with her photo stating: \"Reading is for all\". It was claimed that 1,000 writers, novelists and thinktanks would be there, 300 of them from the Arab world. </p> <p>The event was referred to as a festival of curiosity; meeting the unknown; the alien; the foreign; the exotic; poverty and crisis; it ended with the key words, the third world. Opinions varied: \"Islam is generalised\"; \"it is not about a clash of cultures, it is about fighting terrorism\"; \"the question is not about who was right, we are now responsible for stability and democracy\"; \"all that happens in the world is due to the written word\". The brief mention of the issue of Palestine sounded like history, and the issue of Iraq sounded like the future. </p> <p>With fresh sunflowers in the background, the speakers engaged in botanical terminology. \"A book is like a garden you carry in your pocket\"; \"we want to smell the roses of your garden\"; \"flowers of light\"; and \"fruits of culture\". Entwined in the Laura Ashley exchange, the Arabs insisted they were the source of knowledge since the dawn of civilisation, a fact the Germans diplomatically conceded. </p> <p>I sensed a subtext: \"Hey, west, let's settle the account. You acquired our sciences: now you have the technology. We write about our miseries: now you can help us publish them - and maybe make some money.\" </p> <p>I learned to sense subtexts when I was little. I was my mother's translator. It was my duty to explain to her what was meant in the language of my father's people. Thus I learned the art of simplification. It is interesting what one picks up amidst the differences in cultures. From my parents' disputes I learned the dos and don'ts. </p> <p>In this cultural gathering, I tried to remember not to use the word orientalist in the presence of researchers into Arabic culture; nor to use the term Arabist in the presence of Palestinians. Meanwhile, Iraqis thrived on the term occupation, and a bunch of Israelis who were not happy demonstrated outside the fair against the guest of \"honour\". </p> <p>I liked the expression of a German official who labelled the event \"the city of intellectual wrestling\". I particularly salute its unknown soldiers, the translators. I followed their miraculous input in a very short time, nearly breaking down with exhaustion as they translated the Arab works into German, with great care. They are the true bridge builders. </p> <p>Throughout the symposia I felt too much emphasis was put on questions like: Who are we? Who are they? Who does the novel belong to? What do you consider your home? And the issue of double identities. The theme repeated itself to the extent that when someone asked me, \"So where do you live?\", I decided to adopt my global attitude: \"In my head, and when I want to talk, I open my mouth to let myself out.\" </p> <p>During an overwhelming four days of self-promotion, I was surprised by my Iraqi compatriot's choice of reading. It was a short story about a crime of honour in which the male catches his female partner messing around with another man. A shotgun shows up in the scene, bang, and the lady is dripping with blood in bed! </p> <p>Then I tried to detach myself by attending Arabic musical performances. Sheherazade was a good idea, but Rimsky-Korsakov - not original Arabic compositions - was thrown at the western public, along with an exaggerated sketch of the evil dancer chopping off the heads of 10 female dolls with an Arabian dagger! </p> <p>Low on energy, I bumped into Khalil Shawki, a veteran Iraqi actor in his late 80s. I said: \"I'm not sure that my writing will contribute to changing the world, as expected by all these speeches.\" He replied: \"It's up to you how you use your pen. The human being is like steam: he can move a train or limit himself to a boiling kettle.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Betool Khedairi was born to an Iraqi father and a Scottish mother; she is the author of two novels, A Sky So Close and Ghayeb (The Absent One) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.betoolkhedairi.com\">www.betoolkhedairi.com</a></p>",
  "<b>Murder law</b> <br> The home secretary, David Blunkett, apologised for the botched announcement of a review of the law on murder. He said it had been his intention to make it in Wednesday's debate on the domestic violence, crime and victims bill. But a press release had been issued by his department \"prematurely\" and the stage in which he would have spoken on the legislation was never reached. <p>Mr Blunkett said he had taken steps to avoid such an incident happening again. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said he should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to the house. But he welcomed the review and the home secretary's \"gracious apology\". </p> <p><b>Iraq cost</b><br> Military action in Iraq has cost the British taxpayer \u00a32.159bn, it emerged in the latest government figures. Armed forces minister Adam Ingram said additional defence costs of \u00a3848m were incurred in 2002-3 and \u00a31.311 billion in 2003-4. Estimates for 2004-5 were not yet available. </p> <p><b>School run</b><br> Ten of thousands of poor families and parents of special needs pupils will have to pay for school transport under plans to tackle the school run, shadow education secretary Tim Collins warned. He said plans to hand control of school transport to councils could land them with bills of up to \u00a3500-a-year for each child. </p> <p>MPs were debating the school transport bill, which the government hopes will cut traffic and help curb rising obesity levels of youngsters. Councils in a pilot scheme will be given \u00a3200,000 each to \"kickstart\" trials of new ideas for getting children to school. Authorities taking part would be able to charge fares to help pay for new schemes. </p> <p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, accused the Tories and Liberal Democrats of \"sheer naked opportunism\" and said councils controlled by all parties were keen to take part. </p> <p><b>School dinners</b><br> The standard of food is too low in many schools, the government conceded. Charles Hendry, for the Tories, said a Soil Association report highlighted a \"shocking\" loss of mineral content in school meals. Junior education minister Ivan Lewis said some examples given in the report did not fulfil basic nutritional standards. These were being revised. </p> <p>\"We do accept that there are many secondary schools where standards aren't as high as they should be,\" he said. </p> <p><b>Smacking</b><br> Labour MPs stepped up demands for a free vote on moves to ban smacking and afford children equal protection from assault as adults. The leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, said an outright ban was against government policy but told MPs they could vote on proposals to allow \"mild smacking\". </p> <p><b>Hunting</b><br> Elements of the pro-hunting lobby are undermining its position by resorting to violence and thuggery, Mr Hain warned. It was unacceptable that the security of MPs and ministers was increasingly under threat, he protested. Mr Hain was pelted with eggs by pro-hunt demonstrators as he addressed a meeting at Oxford on Wednesday. </p> <p><b>Pollution</b><br> The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, was prevented by cabinet colleagues from making an oral statement to MPs on scaling down pollution targets, Paul Tyler, for the Liberal Democrats, protested. He also alleged she had been overruled on the issue by Mr Blair and the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt. Mr Hain did not comment on claims about a cabinet split, instead emphasising the government's commitment to reducing emissions. </p> <p><b>Gypsy camps</b><br> The legal process to reclaim land over-run by \"gypsy camps\" takes too long, Tory Adrian Flook said. He told MPs a five-acre field at Curry, Somerset had been \"turned into an illegal gypsy camp complete with roads, fencing and septic tanks\" over a 48-hour period last weekend. Mr Hain said he acknowledged the problem, adding: \"I know these problems bedevil constituencies across the country and your point has been put very effectively.\" </p> <p><b>SNP</b><br> The Scottish National party should make a public apology for branding the Union Flag a \"butcher's apron\", the government was told. Nationalist Bruce McPhee made the comment last week and said he just wanted the Saltire flag to hang outside the Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh. Labour's Jim Sheridan said the statement was \"outrageous\" and demanded an apology. Mr Hain said an apology should be made for the \"disgraceful attack on our armed forces\". </p> <p><b>Regional assembly ballot</b><br> The referendum on a north-east regional assembly, to be declared next Thursday, is degenerating into chaos, shadow Commons leader Oliver Heald claimed. He said: \"Ballot returns are tiny and there are reports that 17-year-olds have received ballot packs in Northumberland. </p> <p>Voters in Darlington are reporting that their ballot packs contained a charity envelope rather than a voting paper.\" Mr Hain hit back: \"The returns are now accelerating and I hope that the people of the north-east of England will vote 'Yes'. </p> <p><b>Robert Kilroy-Silk</b><br> Labour's John Cryer said Robert Kilroy-Silk had used taxpayers' money to stand successfully for election but had now decided to \"have a little tantrum\" and resign the UKIP whip. He told Mr Hain: \"Shouldn't we consider that he pays taxpayers' money back and if he fails or refuses to do it we'll seize his villa in Spain.\" A smiling Mr Hain said he was \"very attracted\" by the proposition. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>Parliament is not sitting. </p> <p> <b>In parliament on Monday</b><br>There are Commons questions on culture, media and sport, the church commissioners, the public accounts commission and the Speaker's committee on the Electoral Commission. The gambling bill is set to gain its second reading. The Lords debates the pensions bill's report stage and Sudan and Darfur.</p>",
  "<p>China took the global markets by surprise yesterday as it raised interest rates for the first time in nine years in an attempt to cool its rampant economy. </p> <p>The move - which raised the country's official deposit and lending rates by 0.27 of a point to 5.53% - sent bonds, stocks and the US dollar into turmoil as financial markets tried to digest the implications for the world economy, of which China is rapidly becoming an increasingly important part. </p> <p>Analysts said the Chinese authorities had probably decided on the move because other measures to rein in credit growth and fixed investment had not been sufficient to cool the economy, which has long been in danger of overheating. </p> <p>The Chinese government estimates that its economy grew at an annual rate of about 9% in the third quarter of the year, down marginally from the 10% seen in the first quarter but still far more rapidly than any economy in the developed world. </p> <p>China is growing so fast that it is likely to overtake Britain in 2005 to become the world's fourth largest economy. </p> <p>Its vastly larger population means its people will take many years to catch up with Britain in terms of income per person, however. </p> <p>The growth rates have been so dramatic that the prices of world commodities such as copper, steel and oil have been pushed to record highs as the Chinese economy has sucked in vast quantities of materials to feed its hungry factories. </p> <p>Oil prices hit a record high of $55.67 earlier this week and analysts say surging Chinese demand has been a crucial factor driving up oil this year. </p> <p>Indeed, oil prices fell back on world markets after the Chinese rate increase on concern that it would cool the country's demand for oil. </p> <p>In London and New York, the stocks of mining companies, which have benefited from the rapid Chinese expansion, fell sharply as traders feared that demand for other commodities would also be hit if the Chinese economy slowed. </p> <p>But analysts cautioned against overreacting. \"The decision to hike rates by China should not come as a shock. We have just come through a period in which global growth was historically rapid, and China was the strongest component,\" said Larry Kantor, an analyst at Barclays Capital. </p> <p>\"Moreover, Chinese inflation has picked up. Growth seems to have slowed somewhat since the extraordinarily rapid pace at the start of the year, but clearly not enough to satisfy the Chinese authorities,\" he added. </p> <p>The dollar gyrated on the foreign exchanges as the markets tried to assess the significance of the move. The currency, the renminbi, is pegged to the dollar by the Chinese authorities at an artificially low rate of 8.28 to the dollar to boost exports. </p> <p>Eventually the dollar fell back against the yen and other major currencies as traders decided the rise could be a precursor to a move by the Chinese authorities to revalue its currency. </p> <p>Tapan Datta, an economist at Schroders, said the rate move was too small by itself to make much difference to the Chinese economy but did signal renewed determination by the Chinese government. </p> <p>\"The bets will be on that further rate rises will come, given that this prolonged policymaking paralysis has been overcome. Worries are going to set in about a tighter policy environment in 2005 and their effects, as they should!\"</p>",
  "<p>Profits at Lord Heseltine's Haymarket Group fell 10% in 2003, according to accounts that have just been filed to Companies House. </p> <p>The trade and consumer magazines group, publisher of Campaign, Management Today and Stuff, made a pre-tax profit of \u00a313.9m for 2003, down from \u00a315.2m the previous year. </p> <p>Turnover, including joint ventures, at the group was virtually static, rising to \u00a3180.6m from \u00a3179.6m. </p> <p>One of the directors, but not Lord Heseltine, received a payment of \u00a31.22m for 2003, which constitutes accumulated bonuses \"for quite a number of years,\" according to the Haymarket finance director, David Fraser. Meanwhile, the group's international expansion continues. </p> <p>Turnover originating outside the UK rose from \u00a319.8m to \u00a342.3m for 2003. Over the year the group established a subsidiary in India, and a joint venture in China. </p> <p>This marks the second year of profitability in a row for the group, following a disastrous 2001, when the global downturn in advertising contributed to a \u00a37.2m loss. </p> <p>The group is majority owned by Lord Heseltine and family trusts. Formerly a Conservative deputy prime minister and president of the Board of Trade, Lord Heseltine was once tipped as a possible Tory leader, though he decided not to contest his Henley seat at the 2001 election. Despite his allegiances, the group contributed just \u00a31,000 to the Conservative party, making a further \u00a325,000 contribution to the centrist umbrella campaign group, Conservative Mainstream. </p> <p>Lord Heseltine said: \"I am pleased to report a steady performance for the Haymarket Group in a year of continued difficult market conditions. </p> <p>\"As we predicted last year, turnover and profits have remained flat where we have faced tough conditions in some of our core markets, but this did not deter us from pursuing our growth plans both in the UK and overseas, shown by the increase in our development expenditure to \u00a32.7m.\"</p>",
  "A lunar eclipse. A World Series victory after 86 years for the Boston Red Sox. For the Democratic faithful, it was an unmistakable omen: John Kerry, locked for weeks in a dead heat with George Bush, now had the stars on his side. <p>Mr Kerry certainly seemed to think so yesterday as he bounded on stage in baseball cap, shirtsleeves and striped tie in Toledo, Ohio, much more relaxed than usual, and visibly happy. </p> <p>\"I'm feeling great,\" he told the crowd in a voice raspy from cheering on his team. He recalled the right-wing radio host who had taunted that he would never be president until the Red Sox won the title: a notion once dismissed as impossible for a team famously seen as cursed. </p> <p>\"We're on our way, we're on our way,\" Mr Kerry gloated. </p> <p>The good humour was infectious and the rumbustious crowd of students, boiler-makers, steelworkers, auto-workers and other union members stamped their approval. Mr Kerry even loosened up enough to admit having Vietnam flashbacks, saying the thunder reminded him of bombing raids, and the audience liked him even more. </p> <p>\"If there was any doubt I had, I don't no more,\" said Jennifer Hawkins, 27, a restaurant manager and part-time student. \"He was just awesome.\" </p> <p>Nobody on the Democratic campaign dares speak of a wave, but with just four days left there is a sense that Mr Kerry is rising to the occasion. </p> <p>Campaign staff often frustrated by their candidate's difficulty in connecting with ordinary Americans are now enjoying a discernible satis faction. Someone has painted \"Red Sox rule\" on the windows of cars in the motorcade. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Kerry's famously convoluted sentences were tighter. The aloof New England demeanour softened, and his message rang more clearly. The candidate with the reputation in baseball par-lance of a \"good closer\" is growing visibly stronger the finish line approaches. </p> <p>This week has been an exercise in endurance and star power. On Tuesday he travelled 3,000 miles in a single day. On Wednesday he enlisted Carole King and Bon Jovi, and last night it was Bruce Springsteen, whose No Surrender Mr Kerry has adopted as his signature tune. </p> <p>At every stop in the midwest he has relied on the same top line, assailing Mr Bush for the disappearance of nearly 400 tonnes of explosives in Iraq. </p> <p>He soon returns to more traditional Democratic terrain, presenting himself as a \"champion for the middle class\" as he tacks a populist line on jobs, healthcare, and tax breaks for the rich. But his focus on the missing explosives has been unblinking, with the Democratic challenger clearly believing the debacle will amplify his larger arguments about Mr Bush's conduct of the war. </p> <p>\"This week's news about the missing explosives speaks directly to the president's mistakes in Iraq,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>On Wednesday he went even further, accusing Mr Bush of putting US troops in greater danger. \"The missing explosives could very likely be in the hands of terrorists and insurgents, who are actually attacking our forces now 80 times a day on average,\" he told a rally in Rochester, Minnesota. </p> <p>As the crowd hooted in delight, he drove the knife in still further, saying: \"I know that President Bush doesn't like to deal with facts, and doesn't like the truth to get in his way.\" </p> <p>The strategy has had some success. Mr Bush waited two days to respond to the charge that the White House was to blame for the wayward explosives. Once he did, Mr Kerry pounced again, accusing him of shirking responsibility for the misdeeds of his administration. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's decision to campaign this week in the states of the upper midwest - Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa - is a defensive one. They narrowly favoured Al Gore in 2000, but this year the Republicans see them as an insurance policy in case Mr Bush fails to hang on to Ohio and Florida. Mr Kerry must protect his flank. </p> <p>For days now the two have traced each other's footsteps across the American heartland, and Mr Bush is due to do his turn in Toledo today. </p> <p>That gives Mr Kerry a double-edged task. He is going to pockets of uncommitted voters and soft Republicans, such as Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Tuesday: a town which has suffered serious job losses. At the same time he has to gee up Democratic bedrock towns such as Toledo. </p> <p>There was good news for the Democrats in Ohio, where a Los Angeles Times poll gave Mr Kerry a six-point lead. But there is a statistical tie in Wisconsin, where Mr Kerry made his second stop in two days yesterday, and in Minnesota, where he was thought to have a tiny edge, there was worrying news in a University of Minnesota poll that showed Ralph Nader siphoning off most of his support, giving Mr Bush a three-point lead. </p> <p>\"It's a very very close election,\" the Democratic governor of Wisconsin, Jim Doyle, said. \"We need to make sure even in areas that are heavily Republican that they are coming out to vote for John Kerry.\" </p> <p>It is an election at which voter sentiment has proved almost impossible to gauge. Registration drives have brought in tens of thousands of potential new voters. Deep anger at Mr Bush has given Mr Kerry thousands of new volunteers. </p> <p>A Democratic strategist in Ohio was not ready to give Mr Kerry victory. \"Most of the states are still on the cusp,\" he said. \"But there are more states on the cusp and leaning towards Bush than on the cusp and leaning towards Kerry.\" </p> <p>What the Democrats now hope is that the Red Sox win, and Mr Kerry's ebullient mood, will tip the balance their way. </p>",
  "<p>The ill-tempered debate about Jonathan Bloomer's suitability to continue as chief executive of Prudential - in the wake of the insurer's sudden and wholly unexpected call for \u00a31bn of fresh cash - rumbles on. </p> <p>Rebel investors are busily briefing the press, on a no-fingerprints basis. They think Bloomer has simply used up too many executive lives with his failed US sortie, a dividend cut and now a major policy U-turn, diverting the Pru's strategic attention from the far east to the British market. </p> <p>But there is a palpable sense of frustration amongst those doing the whispering. In normal circumstances, when a group of disgruntled institutional investors want to impose their views on what they see as a wayward quoted company board, their first port of call is the Association of British Insurers. </p> <p>With the Pru, however, that is a little tricky, because the company happens to be the ABI's biggest member. Hence all the disorganised - and at times contradictory - talking to the press. </p> <p>At the Pru, meanwhile, chairman Sir David Clementi - a genuine top drawer name in financial circles - is said to be at pains to stress that the rights issue decision was very much a board-wide decision. His is a clear message that the non-executives have no intention of feeding Mr Bloomer to the City pack. </p> <p>Albeit faintly, for the moment at least, this affair has echoes of the damaging standoff between investors and the hapless boards at Carlton and Granada before they ousted Michael Green and finally consummated the ITV merger. </p> <p>On that occasion, when institutional views were ignored, the fund managers plotted and plotted, and waited for the moment to act. The end result was much bloodier than it might have been. </p> <p>Mr Bloomer is not yet being held in the same searing contempt reserved for Mr Green. </p> <p>But the Pru man had better hope that his company's share price does not weaken much further from its sickly level, down 8% since the rights was unveiled. </p> <p>The new stock is being offered at 308p - still a substantial discount from today's level. A bad market-wide squall, while failing to trouble the underwriters, could unseat Mr Bloomer in a flash. </p> <p><strong> Reverse thrust </strong><br> </p> <p> Foxtrot Oscar. That was the verbatim response from Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary last month to a demand by the European commission for repayment of the \u20ac4m (\u00a32.8m) in benefits extended to the airline by Belgium's Charleroi airport. </p> <p>O'Leary flatly refused to accept the commission's decision that his airline had enjoyed unfair subsidies from the publicly owned airport through discounted landing charges, aid with training, free office space and cut-price ground handling. </p> <p>But bravado can only get you so far. Faced with the full force of Brussels' legal authority, O'Leary backed down yesterday. Ryanair agreed to put the money into an escrow account which will be released to the Walloon authorities if the ruling is upheld on appeal next year. </p> <p>Ryanair's U-turn statement was full of bluster. It continued to argue that the commission's decision was \"flawed\" and that it \"perverts open and fair competition\". </p> <p>The airline said it was backing down in order to avoid putting the Walloons in a difficult position. It would be awkward for the Belgian regional authority to be pushed into seeking an injunction to demand the cash. </p> <p>When the commission declared its verdict in February, O'Leary declared it a \"disaster\" for passengers and claimed it could lead to the end of low-cost travel as we know it. </p> <p>In fact, the ramifications have been relatively modest. Ryanair has amended its deal with Charleroi and may have to do so elsewhere - its arrangements with several airports in Spain are under the microscope. </p> <p>But there is no sign that the ruling has affected other airlines, nor that Ryanair will be forced to scrap dozens of routes. </p> <p>The commission's verdict on Charleroi was not an attack on cheap flights. It was a response to a very specific situation. O'Leary just may be beginning to recognise that his aggressive style can be counter-productive. </p> <p><strong> Crash avoidance </strong><br> </p> <p> Wall Street is marking the 75th anniversary of the 1929 crash this week in fitting style: investors are not looking backwards, even for a moment. </p> <p>Tuesday saw the flotation of Shopping.com on Nasdaq. The shares promptly soared 60%, giving this six-year-old company, which compares the prices of internet retailers and makes money referring shoppers, a market capitalisation of more than $800m (\u00a3440m). That's about seven times current year revenue forecasts; don't even ask about profits. </p> <p>Yesterday saw the market debut for DreamWorks Animation, the maker of Shrek 2, spun out of Steven Spielberg's film group.

  "The Pope intervened yesterday in the EU's institutional impasse caused by MEPs' opposition to his close friend and confidant Rocco Buttiglione, an outspoken critic of gay and women's rights, as the new justice commissioner. <p>A day after Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the incoming commission president, staved off a defeat by MEPs by withdrawing his entire team, Pope John Paul called for a resolution of the crisis by \"reciprocal respect in a spirit of goodwill\". </p> <p>His intervention, at an audience with Romano Prodi, the outgoing president now acting in a caretaker capacity, came as senior Christian Democrat sources indicated that Mr Buttiglione and \"three or four\" other nominees would have to go to win the parliament's broad backing for the Barroso team. </p> <p>Mr Barroso, who began discussing a reshuffle with EU leaders in Rome last night, on the eve of today's ceremonial signing on the Capitoline Hill of the new constitutional treaty, admitted in a series of radio interviews that \"several changes\" might have to take place, \"well less than eight or 10\". </p> <p>As Tony Blair and other EU leaders tried to resolve the crisis in talks in Rome last night, senior MEPs suggested that it might take until Christmas to resolve the crisis. </p> <p>The Christian Democrats are said to be gunning for Neelie Kroes, a Dutch liberal chosen as competition commissioner, because they blame the 88 Liberal MEPs for the prospective vote against the team which forced Mr Barroso to back down. </p> <p>Ms Kroes is already opposed by Socialists, Greens and other leftwingers on the grounds that her extensive business links constitute a conflict of interests. </p> <p>She dropped her business interests on September 1 and promised not to return to corporate life when her five-year tenure ends in 2009. </p> <p>With every sign of revengeful political leaders seeking tit-for-tat withdrawals of nominated commissioners after this week's wheeler-dealing in Strasbourg, the Hungarian socialist Laszlo Kovacs (energy), the Danish liberal Mariann Fischer Boel (agriculture), the Latvian Ingrida Udre (taxation), and the Greek Stavros Dimas (environment) are all seen as vulnerable. </p> <p>The Pope told Mr Prodi, who plans to lead the Italian left against the re-election of Silvio Berlusconi's government next year, that the EU was wrong to leave Europe's centuries-old Christian heritage out of its new constitution. </p> <p>Mr Buttiglione, who founded the ultra-conservative Communione e Liberazione group in 1968 to campaign against the secularisation of Italian and European society, fought to get a mention of Christianity in the constitution when he sat as minister for Europe on the EU convention drawing up the treaty. </p> <p>In the face of evidence that most MEPs are determined to hold on to a vision of the EU as a secular entity, Mr Berlusconi, another conservative Catholic, clung to Mr Buttiglione as Italy's nominee. </p> <p>Mr Berlusconi, who presides over today's ceremonies in the room where the EU's founding treaty was signed in 1957, said his friend had been chosen by \"consensus and appreciation\". </p> <p>He is under pressure to nominate Franco Frattini, his foreign minister, or retain Mario Monti, the outgoing competition commissioner. </p> <p>Mr Barroso's dilemma is heightened by the reluctance of government leaders to withdraw their nominees, prompting some Christian Democrats to suggest that there will be a minimal reshuffle in which two lose their posts and three or four otherschange places. </p> <p>But parliamentary leaders said he would not win over enough MEPs and could simply prolong the crisis. </p> <p>Gary Titley, the Labour leader, urged Mr Barroso to present his new team at next month's plenary session of the parliament.</p>",
  "Tony Blair's friend Bill Clinton rose from his sick bed this week to deliver a timely message to American voters: \"If one candidate is trying to scare you, and the other is trying to get you to think; if one is appealing to your fears, and the other is appealing to your hopes - it seems to me you ought to vote for the person who wants you to think and hope.\" <p>At the next election in Britain, however, it seems unlikely that too much hope will be on offer, at least from Labour. The cabinet yesterday agreed the legislative programme for the probable final session of this parliament. From identity cards to anti-terrorist legislation, it is likely to be dominated by fear. The Britain this Queen's speech will address appears to be a nation under threat from (in no particular order): illegal immigrants, rowdy youngsters, litter louts, liberal judges and organised crime. Oh, and a global terrorist network, too. After cabinet Mr Blair went on to launch another crackdown on a perennial enemy: yobs and nuisance neighbours. \"People are entitled to feel safe,\" he said. </p> <p>You do not need to subscribe to the whole conspiratorial thesis of the BBC's provocative series, The Power of Nightmares, to wonder then why Mr Blair continually emphasises threats. The sense of alarm was underlined by the newly appointed Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair (no relation), who in his inaugural remarks repeated the view that terrorists would attempt to attack Britain and announced that Special Branch officers would be abandoning their desks to track down al-Qaida in the streets of the inner cities. </p> <p>Terrorism is indeed a threat. It places a burden on the state that cannot justifiably be equated with the task of, say, promoting road safety (though the risk of dying in a car accident is greater than that of dying in a terrorist attack). But the atmosphere engendered by fighting terrorism may be almost as damaging to the principles that underpin liberal democracy. To compromise civil liberties as much as this government has done offers not only a kind of victory to the terrorists. It also contributes to a broader lowering of legal standards, an uncomfortable slide that links counter-terrorism legislation to other measures such as changes to court procedure intended to make it easier to secure convictions, or yesterday's extension of anti-social behaviour orders. In the name of security, the government magnifies the climate of terror. But it is far from proven that such an approach actually does as much damage to the terrorist threat as it does to the civil liberties of British citizens.</p>",
  "Michael Howard yesterday marked the eve of the first anniversary of Iain Duncan Smith's downfall by promoting the only frontbencher who put his head above the parapet in an attempt to overthrow the former Tory leader. <p>Crispin Blunt, a former army officer who resigned from the frontbench in May last year, joined the whips office last week but the announcement was delayed until last night. </p> <p>The timing may be seen as unfortunate, not least by Mr Duncan Smith who is still sore about his treatment a year ago today when Tory MPs voted by 90 to 75 to unseat him. </p> <p>In a mini-reshuffle Richard Ottaway stood down as shadow environment secretary to serve on the Commons defence select committee. Tim Yeo, the environment team leader, will take over his duties. The other change sees Andrew Selous, the MP for Bedfordshire South West, join the whips office. </p> <p>Mr Blunt laughed last night when he was reminded of the overthrow of Mr Duncan Smith, which came nearly six months after he issued a call for him to make an \"enormous personal sacrifice\". He said: \"That is all behind us. \"We are working together to win the election. Iain and I talk perfectly happily.\" </p> <p>His remarks reflect the feelings of most Tory MPs who agree that the unanimous election of Mr Howard as leader transformed the mood of the party, if not its place in the hearts of the British people. \"Is it a year since Dunkers fell?\" asked one frontbencher. \"Let's have a party and celebrate.\" </p> <p>Tory MPs agree that the departure of Mr Duncan Smith has at least ensured that the party will avoid being wiped out at the next election. </p> <p>He won widespread praise for placing Europe on the back burner and for focusing efforts on public services to help \"vulnerable\" people. But his poor performance on television and his angry, but ineffective, appearances in the Commons persuaded MPs that they should dump him. </p> <p>Many MPs are, however, concerned at the party's failure to make any headway in the polls. The latest Guardian/ ICM poll put the Tories on 32%, with Labour on 37%. The last Guardian/ICM poll during Mr Duncan Smith's leadership placed the Tories on 33%, with Labour on 38%. </p> <p>The leadership, which admits it is not doing well enough in the polls, believes that the collapse in trust in Tony Blair will benefit the party at the election. Aides also believe this will give them one key benefit - victory for the no side in the referendum on the European constitution. </p> <p>Mr Howard intensified his campaign against the European constitution. In a speech at the British headquarters of Goldman Sachs, the Tory leader said: \"Far from addressing [Europe's problems] the constitution will compound them. It will be a giant ball and chain round the ankle of British business.\" </p> <p>He believes he embarrassed the prime minister in the Commons this week when he quoted the former Downing Street economics adviser, Derek Scott, who warned the constitution would \"entrench Europe's economic failings and drag Britain down too\". </p> <p>The threat to the economy will be one of Mr Howard's main lines of attack as he seeks to avoid repeating William Hague's flag-waving campaign against the euro. \"The EU was designed to liberate our markets. Instead it has burdened them with extra costs and regulations, undermining their abil ity to compete. The status quo in Europe is not an option: it is a recipe for economic decline.\"</p>",
  "Today in Rome the prime ministers of 25 European nations gather to sign up to a common constitution and to commit themselves to the same standards of human rights and democratic values. <p>Pause a while to contemplate the remarkable transformation of European politics which has made this event possible. Most of the countries sitting together in the same council chamber have been at war with each other in living memory, and repeatedly in the century that preceded it. A third of the states affirming the new charter of fundamental rights were satellites of the Soviet Union within the past generation, and denied both individual rights and national self-determination. </p> <p>Another two were victims of the last fascist dictatorships in Europe, and a third was ruled by a military junta. The evolution of our continent into a partnership of nations which guarantees human rights and banishes war is an extraordinary achievement, which previous generations would have regarded with envy. </p> <p>Yet how many voices will be heard in Britain hailing today's event as a triumph? Any brave soul murmuring that there may be something positive to be said for a Europe of peace and democracy will be drowned out by the blast of amplified heckling from the Daily Mail, the Murdoch press, and the post-Hollinger Telegraph. The Mail has dubbed the European constitution as the greatest threat to confront us for a thousand years. It takes a high degree of perversity to regard a charter of human rights as a greater threat to our country than the Norman Conquest, the Spanish Armada or the London Blitz. </p> <p>But their appeal to a past millennium betrays what drives their resistance to European integration - a misplaced nostalgia for the outdated world of freestanding nations. It is an era that has vanished. We are all interdependent now. The Eurosceptics bitterly complain that membership of the European Union requires us to compromise with others and to give up going our own way, but those are necessary conditions of life in an interdependent world. In truth it is not the rules of the EU that the Eurosceptics dislike, but the reality of that modern world. </p> <p>It is a paradox that the European constitution should have become the target for attack by those who complain most volubly about a slide into a federal Europe. They should be welcoming a constitution that delivers a hard knock to federalism and tilts the balance of power towards member states. The biggest innovation to the institutions of Europe will be a full-time president of the council of ministers based in Brussels, in place of the rotation of the presidency every six months between prime ministers based in the distant capital of their country. The new animal in the Brussels jungle will produce a further shift of initiative away from the commission and to the council, which represents the member states. In the argot of Brussels, the future direction of the EU will be less supranational and more intergovernmental. </p> <p>It is that kind of impenetrable language that has helped create the barriers between the European project and the people it is supposed to serve. Electorates across the continent do not feel they have ownership of the EU, and the scenes on television bulletins tonight may only serve to confirm their suspicion that it is the property of top politicians meeting in exclusive venues. Europe's leaders need to spend less time revising the rules under which they hold meetings, and put an awful lot more energy into convincing their voters that the outcome of those meetings is in their interest. </p> <p>Holding a referendum on the European constitution is not necessarily the smartest way of setting about that task. It runs the risk of confirming the stereotype of the EU as a remote body whose primary purpose is extruding lengthy texts rather than a valuable organisation to promote trade and jobs, protect the environment and raise standards of employee rights. </p> <p>However, defeat in the referendum would be a dire reverse in the long march to persuade Britain to be comfortable with its place at the European table. Most of the European constitution is not new at all. Three-quarters of it is a consolidation of all the European treaties going back over half a century. Vote no to the European constitution and you reject everything we have signed up to over a generation. A focus of the Mail assault has been the provision that European law takes primacy over domestic legislation, but that has been the rule ever since we joined in 1975. If Britain votes no on those grounds we are rejecting the very basis on which we became members. </p> <p>It is a chimera to imagine that we could then merrily continue to trade the great majority of our exports to the rest of Europe, while sidestepping any political cooperation. Telling the continent \"Get lost, but keep buying British\" is unlikely to work with our European neighbours. Nor should the Murdoch attempt to design a business Europe shorn of its social dimension have any appeal to the British left. </p> <p>This brings us to the positive reason why the left should welcome today's adoption of the European constitution. The progressive case for supporting the constitution is that it expresses values and goals of the European social model. It defines the values of the EU as \"respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights\". It sets full employment as a goal of the EU and commits it to \"combat social exclusion and discrimination\" and to \"promote social justice\". </p> <p>Its charter of fundamental rights embraces economic and social rights, such as limitations on working time, the right to consultation at work and the right to social security out of work. Indeed, one of the most bitter complaints of the right about the constitution is that it explicitly enshrines the right to strike. </p> <p>The strategic case for reaffirming those European social values is that for the past four years they have been under siege by a US administration which has demonstrated an evangelical zeal for reshaping the world in the image of Texas. The lesson of the recent past is that when Europe is divided its views can be ignored and its values can be undermined. The left, more than anyone else, should support a constitution for a strong Europe that can offer a multilateral partnership in place of Bush's unilateralism, and our social model as an alternative to his version of feral capitalism. </p> <p>Europeans have no vote in next week's presidential election. But we can at least vote on today's constitution, and if the US result goes wrong, it will be all the more important that we affirm our right to different European values. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:r.cook@theguardian.com\">r.cook@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Bjorn Lomborg, the controversial environmentalist, recently brought 38 top economists to Copenhagen to discuss the best ways of helping the world's poor. Most of their conclusions were commendable. Asked about the most cost-effective way to spend $50bn, the economists put control of HIV/Aids at the top of their priorities, reckoning that $27bn could prevent 28 million cases of HIV by 2010. Second, they allocated $12bn on micronutrients for the diets of 850 million people in chronically malnourished sub-Saharan countries. Third, more controversially, they decided to promote free trade - but since that would mean the end of agriculture subsidies it could free $250bn a year to spend on other things. </p> <p>The sting was in the tail. Bottom of their priorities for the human race came climate change, which they dismissed as a problem for the future rather than today. Would it were so. Yet global warming is like a slow heating kettle taking ages to come to the boil. The signs of warming we see today are the results of actions taken, or not taken, 30 years ago. Climate change that causes floods in some places and drought in others hurts the poor most, by depriving them of food and drinking water. Even if there were not a threat of global warming it makes sense to implement the Kyoto protocols. It is essential we use finite sources of energy more economically and think of our environmental legacy to future generations as well as facing today's problems. </p> <p>It is economic nonsense to suggest that there is just one pot of money from which all these things must be funded. There is no reason why the world cannot help the poor and fund a solution for global warming at the same time. There is a variant of Pascal's Wager at work here. Even if there were only a 30% chance that the global consensus of scientists was right in claiming that global warming could bring catastrophe, the consequences of doing nothing at all would be too horrendous to contemplate without first taking out a very hefty insurance policy. What is stopping us doing more to help the world's poor is not lack of money - it is lack of will.</p>"
