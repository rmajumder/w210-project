  "<p>It is a strange feeling being here at Britain's pre-Olympic training camp in Paphos because I am in a resort surrounded by thousands of Britons enjoying their summer holidays and I am most definitely not on my holidays. </p> <p>There is no sitting around the swimming pool with a cocktail, or heading off to the hotel's nightclub and partying until the small hours. For me, it is early to bed and early to rise. </p> <p>Since I got here on Sunday evening, I have followed the same routine. I get up at 8am, have a light breakfast and am at the training track,which is about two miles away, by 10am. </p> <p>There I do some warming up, a bit of stretching and some gentle strides. Most of the hard work for Athens was done in the winter and the early part of the spring. If I am not ready now, then it is too late to do anything about it. </p> <p>It is all about walking a fine line and making sure I remain active in order to keep my muscles ticking over. I do not want to overdo it and risk causing myself an injury that could jeopardise my participation in the games. </p> <p>That is why one of the best things about being here is the incredible medical support that is here with the team. As soon as I finish a session I come back to the hotel, have a shower, a spot of lunch and am able to have treatment and a massage. </p> <p>I do not have any serious problems but the sheer fact that I am an international sprinter means that I inevitably suffer from niggles because of the strain that I place on my body - it goes with the job. Getting these minor problems seen to straight away should ensure that they do not develop into anything more serious. </p> <p>Dean Kenneally, the team's physiotherapist, who is joining Tottenham Hotspur after the games, is considered to be a bit of a genius among the athletes, after the great work he has done in the past with Denise Lewis and Dean Macey. </p> <p>I have had treatment under him before at the High Performance Centre in Birmingham so he knows my body and all the various crinks that need straightening out pretty well. </p> <p>I am hoping that this kind of round-the-clock treatment will give me the boost that I need before I get to Athens on August 17. </p> <p>In the afternoon I usually do another light session to keep my muscles loose. The other sprinters and I also have relay practice to fit in around preparing for our individual events. </p> <p>We then warm-up together and have a bit of a joke before working on our baton changes. We know that we definitely have a chance of a medal - perhaps even a gold - so it is something we are taking very seriously. </p> <p>Once my training is complete and my body has been given the once-over by Dean, it is important I relax. That is why I have brought my Playstation and X-box over from Birmingham. </p> <p>When you are away in a hotel like this where there is so much lovely food and drink available, the temptation is to stuff yourself silly. Obviously, that is the last thing that I want to do just a week before I am due to run in the Olympics. </p> <p>I have to be disciplined to limit my intake and make sure that I do not pile on the pounds. It comes back to what I said in my column on Monday - it is about being disciplined and remembering that I am here to do a job for my country. When you are surrounded by so many great athletes, it is a lot easier to do. I have never been to a camp like this before and it is fascinating observing people like Darren Campbell and Denise Lewis as they prepare. </p> <p>You watch what people like that do because they have been to an Olympics and come back with medals. </p> <p>They are so professional and thorough about everything they do and I am making sure that I observe and hopefully learn. It is certainly a fascinating experience and is making me really excited about Athens. The people here on holiday tell me to go out and make them proud.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edinburgh is rainy. We've gone from drizzle to out-and-out monsoon. Turns out that all the summer dresses and flip-flops I've packed will go unworn, and I'll have to sit around the flat in my pyjamas while the one jumper and pair of jeans in my suitcase get washed every other day. </p> <p>It's the street performers I feel most sorry for, especially the human statues. Imagine: you spend two hours at home in the morning painting yourself silver, then you leave the house, the rain comes pouring down, and you're nothing more than a slightly grubby person standing very still. </p> <p>As a stand-up comic, pampered with a microphone and lights and seats and a roof (at least at most gigs), I have nothing but admiration for street performers, and this is a great place to see them. The director of my stand-up show, John Fealey, worked for many years as a street performer (his shows at this festival with Eddie Izzard in 2001 are the stuff of legend), and he has taught me lots of useful skills. </p> <p>The first night that my show opened at the Assembly Rooms, it was running a bit late because of all the delays that had accumulated in the venue in the course of the day (this always happens on the first night of every venue in Edinburgh). John instructed me to go and talk to the queue of people who were waiting for my show and tell them what was happening, and that we would be going ahead as soon as possible. I was stupidly terrified, because I'm used to dealing with people via a microphone in a properly set-up environment. But actually, talking to the crowd outside the venue - as I handed out conciliatory sweets - was a really fun thing to do. I'm considering phoning in hoax bomb threats to the Assembly Rooms every day so that I get to do it all the time. </p> <p>The Assembly Rooms is a lovely venue to perform at: the crowds so far have been very nice, and I've spotted Alan Rickman, Michael Portillo and Rodney Bewes there. If you want to come and rub shoulders with celebrities such as these, as well as enjoying a fine night of stand-up comedy, may I suggest that you come to Stand-up for Freedom, the Amnesty International benefit that will be held on August 18. It's hosted by Boothby Graffoe, it features an outstanding line-up of musicians and comedians and it's a great excuse to come out and have a laugh for a good cause. And though, as a Wednesday this is technically a school-night, you might have a few drinks. It's for charity. I intend to be so charitable that I need a long lie-in the next day. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I'm also gearing up for my acting debut in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. As I write, we're set to open tomorrow, as Christian Slater has thankfully recovered from chicken-pox. Even though I only have a few lines, I'm terrified that I'm going to forget them. I keep thinking about the story of the actor who had only one line as a French soldier in a play about the Napoleonic war. The line was: \"Hark! I hear the cannons roar,\" and he rehearsed it day and night, playing with different stresses and perfecting his French accent. On the play's opening night he heard the actual - very loud - sound effect of the cannon's roar for the first time, and his line came out as: \"What the fuck was that?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I feel I should close by recommending some other shows from the fringe festival. In no particular order, I would advise that you see Jim Sweeney's My MS and Me at the Gilded Balloon, Count Arthur Strong's Through It All, I've Always Laughed at the Pod Deco, and Dirty Fan Male - The Show at the Gilded Balloon. </p> <p>Sweeney's show is a funny and moving description of living with multiple sclerosis. Count Arthur Strong is a theatrical phenomenon - shambling, inept, drunk and utterly hilarious. Dirty Fan Male is a selection of genuine letters that men have sent to female porn stars: occasionally disturbing and utterly compelling.</p>",
  "<p>A year to the day after the temperature in Kent rose to 38.5C (101F), the highest ever recorded in Britain, the Met Office was yesterday advising campers in the Pennines to consider packing up and seeking shelter indoors. </p> <p>The north and Midlands bore the brunt of yesterday's torrential downpours, with 100mm of rain falling in less than 24 hours over parts of Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire. More was forecast by this morning. </p> <p>Holidaymakers on their way to France endured lengthy delays after one of the two tracks running through the Channel tunnel had to be shut after humidity overwhelmed the signals. </p> <p>Drivers waited up to four hours to board the Eurotunnel shuttle at Folkestone and passengers at Waterloo were delayed for up to 90 minutes. </p> <p>Eurotunnel blamed the hold-ups on a rare combination of summer heat and soaked trains that had led to unusually high humidity in the tunnel. </p> <p>\"Because all the trains going into the tunnel are wet, it's caused problems for the signals,\" a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Rail services in the north-west were also badly affected when several stretches of track flooded. A number of Arriva Trains Northern and First North Western trains were cancelled and flooding near Carlisle caused delays on the west coast line. </p> <p>Another 50,000 tonnes of storm sewage had to be discharged into the Thames at Isleworth. Tens of thousands of fish died last week after London's drains were overwhelmed and emptied 600,000 tonnes of waste water into the river. </p> <p>Fifteen centimetres (6in) of water flooded parts of Whiston hospital in Liverpool, forcing the casualty department to close. </p> <p>\"The trolleys were standing in it,\" a hospital spokeswoman said. \"The water has been pumped away and we are working on the clean-up operation now. It is too early to say if any equipment has been damaged.\" </p> <p>Nine homes were inundated in the Lancashire village of Laneshawbridge. Firefighters pumped 30cm of water back into the river Laneshaw, but evacuated the residents because of fears that the floodwaters had affected the electricity supply. </p> <p>The number of flood warnings rose steadily yesterday as the Environment Agency said a number of rivers were close to bursting their banks. </p> <p>By early evening, 58 local warnings had been issued, chiefly in the Midlands and the north-east, and a further 56 alerts were in place in other parts of England. </p> <p>Cars and buses became stranded in 90cm of water in Sheffield, briefly halting the city's trams. Overspilling drains were mostly to blame, though the agency used loudhailers to warn people living close to the Sheaf that the river would flood. </p> <p>The waterlogged ground in East Anglia, which endured 2 times as much rain as usual during July, was spared the worst of the storms. </p> <p>Twenty-two areas are on flood alert and further rain is forecast in the region during the second half of August. </p> <p>The Met Office, which has put out more than 20 severe weather warnings since Friday, said the downpours would ease off over the next few days. </p> <p>\"The persistent stuff that we've got at the moment is going to nudge northwards,\" a forecaster said yesterday. </p> <p>\"There will be heavy rain mixed up in that, but not the torrential rain we've been seeing this week.\" Eastern Scotland will continue to see plenty of rain. </p> <p>\"Flooding is a natural phenomenon that we expect to see more of,\" David Rooke, the head of flood defence at the Environment Agency, said yesterday. </p> <p>The agency warned that the extreme weather conditions would worsen unless carbon emissions were reduced. </p> <p>Summer rainfall could fall by 60% by 2080, with the south-east likely to experience the biggest rise in temperature over the next few decades.</p>",
  "<p>Four workers were killed and seven others were injured on Monday in Japan's most deadly nuclear power plant accident. </p> <p>Officials insisted that no radiation escaped when steam leaked from cooling pipes at the Mihama plant in Fukui prefecture, but the plant's owner faced criticism after it was revealed the pipes had not been inspected since 1996. </p> <p><strong>Japan Today</strong> put the incident in the context of a series of recent safety problems that have lead to widespread distrust of nuclear power. </p> <p>Japan was already \"reeling from past accidents and scandals\", including \"cover-ups by utility companies of safety violations\". </p> <p>It warned that the accident would \"deal a serious blow to the nuclear industry in Japan, which depends on nuclear power to supply 40% of its electricity\". </p> <p>The <strong>Mainichi Shimbun</strong> agreed. \"We cannot ignore the impact the accident will have on Japan's nuclear power plant development and nuclear energy policy as a whole,\" it said. </p> <p>\"In Japan, it is virtually impossible to build new nuclear facilities,\" added the <strong>Asahi Shimbun</strong>. </p> <p>The paper was concerned about the state of the country's existing plants: \"Facilities are wearing out, and there are worries about increasing problems with corroding pipes.\" </p> <p>Overseas, the accident prompted several papers to consider the global profile of nuclear energy. Despite the \"fearsome challenges\", the <strong>Financial Times</strong> reckoned that nuclear power had an \"enduring attraction\", and was \"creeping up the political agenda in many countries\" because of fears over the political, environmental and financial costs of relying on other forms of energy. </p> <p>For oil-rich countries in the Middle East, the incident showed how ill-advised it would be for politicians to listen to the pro-nuclear lobby. </p> <p>\"Such is the nature of nuclear power that any accident is one too many,\" warned the Saudi <strong>Arab News</strong>. </p> <p>If the \"methodical\" Japanese could not prevent such an incident, then \"there is no such thing as a safe nuclear power station\". </p> <p>\"The real lesson, that runs through all the nuclear accidents of the last 48 years, is that the nuclear dream was a misconception,\" concluded Qatar's <strong>Gulf Times</strong>. </p> <p>\"The risks and problems it creates exceed its benefits.\"</p>",
  "<p>Japanese tyre maker Bridgestone boosted its full-year net profit forecast by 39% thanks to favourable exchange rates and strong sales at home and overseas. </p> <p>The revision was expected after the company lifted its profit forecasts in May for the January-June first half, but had left full-year projections untouched citing risks of the yen's strengthening, among other factors. </p> <p>The dollar was trading at about \u00a5110 yesterday, compared with Bridgestone's initial assumption of an average \u00a5105 this year. </p> <p>Bridgestone expects net profit of \u00a5104bn (\u00a3511m) for 2004 instead of \u00a575bn forecast six months ago. Last year's figure was \u00a588.72bn. </p> <p>A consensus estimate of 15 brokerages put full-year net profit at \u00a598bn, up 10% from last year. </p> <p>On top of increasing global tyre sales, Bridgestone is likely to get a boost from last month's reopening two months ahead of schedule of the rubber-mixing facility at its Tochigi plant, badly damaged by a fire in 2003. </p> <p>For the six months to June 30, net profit rose 63.6% to \u00a552.29bn, while recurring profit grew 31.8% to \u00a586.82bn on sales of \u00a51.15 trillion, up 3.7%. </p> <p>Those results outperformed Bridgestone's latest net and recurring profit forecasts of \u00a545bn and \u00a578bn. </p> <p>Before the announcement, Bridgestone shares ended down 0.82% at \u00a51,942 against a rise of 0.41% in the Nikkei 225.</p>",
  "<p>How do you make \u00a38m in half an hour? The answer, it seems, in the case of Citigroup, is to sell a container-load of bonds issued by eurozone countries, creating a market panic in the process, before then buying back a chunk of the same bonds at lower prices. </p> <p>This, or something like it, seems to have happened on a quiet day last week. Citigroup, the world's largest financial institution, refuses to talk in detail about the saga, but it is nevertheless clear that it sold an astonishing \u20ac11bn (\u00a37.3bn) worth of eurozone government bonds via the Italy-based MTS electronic trading system. </p> <p>Across a wide range of debt instruments, this had the predictable effect of pushing down prices - by about 40 ticks, or 0.4% of a percentage point. </p> <p>It may not sound much but, when you are dealing in billions, small margins can still translate to substantial profits. </p> <p>When Citigroup bought back \u20ac4bn of the same bonds half an hour later it will have benefited by about \u20ac12m, assuming a more conservative profit (or spread) of about 30 ticks. </p> <p>Eurozone bonds will seem pretty esoteric stuff to many readers, but many dealers who found themselves on the losing side of these transactions reckon Citigroup is guilty of something akin to market manipulation. </p> <p>MTS, which is owned by a group of banks, is sufficiently concerned to have placed a temporary restriction of \u20ac1bn on the amount that any bank can trade within two minutes. </p> <p>Of course, Citigroup did nothing illegal here. It legitimately filled orders that had been placed by willing counterparties, all of whom were grown-up financial institutions used to dealing in large numbers. </p> <p>The novel aspect was to trade in such size across a range of debt at such speed. It looks to have been a clever, if controversial, piece of market trading. </p> <p>Even so, two thoughts occur. One is that eurozone governments will not like the idea that a US investment bank is using its huge balance sheet to play silly buggers with their debt, particularly if the effect is to reduce liquidity; Citigroup, which likes to act for governments directly, will have received some black marks in certain European capitals. </p> <p>Second, the tale illustrates the truly huge sums now involved in what the investment banks call proprietary trading, and outsiders think of as gambling with the bank's capital. </p> <p>The buccaneering Citigroup trade was clearly well-designed and executed - but, sooner or later, there will be a major casualty in this game. </p> <p><strong> Water fight </strong><br> </p> <p>Tens of thousands of dead fish in the River Thames are concentrating minds in Essen, headquarters of RWE, the German multi-utility. </p> <p>It owns Thames Water, the company that discharged more than 600,000 tonnes of raw sewage into the eponymous river during last week's torrential floods - to avoid that sewage flowing on to the capital's streets and into homes and offices. </p> <p>There is a (drawing-board) scheme to prevent a recurrence of last week's ecological setback - a \u00a32bn tunnel stretching 20 kilometres to end storm discharges through 58 special sluices. But Philip Fletcher, the water industry regulator at Ofwat, is sceptical about such grandiose and costly schemes. </p> <p>He and Harry Roels, RWE's chief executive, are squaring up for a public battle over investment in the capital's Victorian network of pipes and sewers. Yesterday, Mr Roels spent a not insignificant part of his presentation on RWE's first-half results addressing the issue. </p> <p>Thames Water, as a non-listed British company, is the only one regulated by Mr Fletcher that is seriously threatening to take him and his regulatory proposals to the Competition Commission if his final plans this December do not allow it to invest more and raise charges to customers. </p> <p>In his initial proposals for the next five years - warmly welcomed by consumer groups and the Environment Agency and surprisingly embraced by investors and companies - Mr Fletcher slashed Thames's investment plans from \u00a34bn to \u00a32.7bn and cut prospective real-term price increases from 38% to 14.5%. </p> <p>It was part of an overall approach, consummate in its political adroitness, that lopped \u00a35bn off capital spending, halved proposed price rises, gave companies a slightly better rate of return (5.1%) than feared and also added incentives to squeeze further efficiencies (3% a year). </p> <p>The regulator effectively told ministers they had better come up with ideas of their own to relieve the financial burden on pensioners and the poor. </p> <p>Mr Roels and Bill Alexander, his chief at Thames, had better think very carefully before they rush to the Competition Commission in the fond but mistaken belief they are the avant-garde of the corporate water sector. </p> <p>Given that Mr Fletcher has already indicated he could allow interim price rises during the next five years and approve other, properly costed investment schemes, probably including those planned by Thames, the men in Essen should stick to traditional German prudence and rejoin the pack.</p>",
  "<p>Oil majors, including Shell and BP, are moving closer to establishing a long-term presence in Iraq, source of the world's second-largest oil reserves, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Shell, which has been forced to downgrade its proven oil and gas reserves by almost a quarter this year, has appointed a Dubai-based exploration and production executive to act as its \"country chairman\" for Iraq. </p> <p>It has consulted an executive search firm to help find an Iraqi to act as \"external affairs support\" for Wolfgang Stroebl, the senior manager, described as \"projects director\", spearheading its return to Iraq some 30 years after Saddam Hussein nationalised the industry. </p> <p>Both Shell and BP also said they were evaluating the prospect of conducting research into two of Iraq's biggest oilfields - Kirkuk in the north of the country and Rumaila, close to the Kuwaiti border. </p> <p>As Iraqi officials said output from the country's southern fields was resuming, helping to ease global oil prices, the government put out tenders for the two fields. The process closes on Sunday. </p> <p>BP, whose chief executive, Lord Browne, has been hostile towards investment in Iraq because of the security situation, said it was considering a bid. Shell said it was evaluating both opportunities. </p> <p>Both groups indicated that this technical work, using existing data, would not require a physical presence in Iraq and Shell insisted that it had no staff working in the country. </p> <p>But Platform, a research group specialising in the environmental and social impacts of the oil industry and a long-standing critic of Shell, said this was disingenuous, given its appointment of Mr Stroebl. </p> <p>Greg Muttitt, who discovered the advertisement seeking Mr Stroebl's assistant, said the German-born executive had been working in and around Iraq since at least the late 1990s as a negotiator with the authorities. </p> <p>The advertisement, placed by Glenn Irvine International, says the successful candidate will help bring \"suitable op portunities to fruition on behalf of the company\" and draw up a \"reputation management plan\". They will ideally have \"strong family connections and an insight into the network of families of significance within Iraq\". </p> <p>Platform said Mr Stroebl's \"secretive\" appointment contradicted statements to shareholders at the June annual meeting that Shell had no activity or plans in Iraq. </p> <p>The group, which refused to comment publicly on his role, insisted he was operating from outside the country and the Iraqi government would determine the pace of developments. </p> <p>It said: \"We are interested in establishing a material and enduring presence in Iraq. We have no intention of operating there unless stability and security are ensured not only for the communities in which we would operate but for the sake of Shell's staff.\" </p> <p>Shares in the troubled Russian oil company Yukos plunged yesterday after bailiffs seized shares in the company's core operating unit, Yuganskneftega, for the second time, writes Carolynne Wheeler in Moscow . </p> <p>Lawyers for Yukos said yesterday that the oil company may contest the move after justice ministry officials, collecting a $3.4bn tax debt, announced they would again seize shares despite a court decision on Friday that an earlier seizure was illegal. </p> <p>Yukos shares ended the day down nearly 14%. Trade on the Moscow exchange was suspended for more than an hour in the morning after shares fell more than 15%. </p> <p>Yesterday was the day when Yukos had warned it would have to stop shipping oil by rail as its tariffs were paid only until then. But the company yesterday confirmed that its oil shipments would continue throughout the month. Analysts have speculated that Yukos's subsidiary operations are footing the bill. </p> <p>The Moscow arbitration court yesterday adjourned until next week hearings of a plea by Yukos to stop bailiffs from enforcing collection of its $3.4bn tax bill.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Murray is an Irish diplomat and writer. His biography of Lafcadio Hearn won the Koizumi Yakumo literary prize in Japan in 1995. His latest work, From the Shadow of Dracula: A Life of Bram Stoker has just been published by Jonathan Cape. Here he chooses his top 10 novels in the older gothic tradition.</p> <h2>1. The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole</h2> <p>Horace Walpole published what is generally recognised as the first gothic novel almost two and a half centuries ago. The Castle of Otranto (1765) created a confluence of medievalism and terror that has mutated and endured ever since. Stoker may have paid an oblique tribute by featuring Walpole's kinsman, the 17th century prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, in Miss Betty (1898), his next novel after Dracula.</p> <h2>2. History of the Caliph Vathek by William Beckford</h2> <p>William Beckford's History of the Caliph Vathek (1786) merged the 18th century fashion for oriental tales with the newly-established gothic tradition. Byron and Mallarme, among others, admired this work, which HP Lovecraft considered caught well the \"shadowy spectral horror of the Saracen spirit\". A fascination with, and fear of, the east was a feature of the gothic novel.</p> <h2>3. The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe</h2> <p>Radcliffe's 1794 work anticipates Stoker's ability to describe landscapes unseen by the author. The final chase of Count Dracula across Europe by his righteous band of pursuers also recalls Radcliffe at her considerable best. She has a masterful ability to suggest the supernatural without ultimately invoking it. Hugely, and deservedly, popular in her time.</p> <h2>4. The Monk by Matthew Lewis</h2> <p>One of the most vicious, rip-roaring and entertaining novels of the entire gothic genre. Written by an MP, its reactionary political message - an attempt to revive the horror of the intertwined threat of the Spanish and the Papacy at a time when they had been displaced as the main threat to the British state by the new ideology of the French Revolution - is clearer in retrospect. It shocked even Byron when it appeared in 1796.</p> <h2>5. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley</h2> <p>Together with John Polidori's The Vampire (the first fictional vampire tale), Frankenstein (1818) emerged from the high jinks, featuring the Shelleys, Matthew Lewis, Polidori and Byron, at the Villa Diodati on the shores of Lake Geneva in 1816. It created a monster rivaled only by Count Dracula in the global consciousness. It also contains a reference to the monster as a vampire and anticipates Dracula's multiple narrator technique. It marks a confluence of the gothic and romanticism.</p> <h2>6. Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Maturin</h2> <p>Representing the beginning of the Irish gothic tradition in 1820, it is considered by some the greatest of all gothic works. Representing a significant stride in the evolution of the genre, Melmoth profoundly influenced some of the most important writers of the 19th century, including Scott, Thackeray and Baudelaire. Balzac grouped Melmoth with Moliere's Don Juan, Goethe's Faust and Byron's Manfred as one of the supreme allegorical figures of modern literature. Maturin's relative, Oscar Wilde, symbolically took the name Sebastian Melmoth when he went into exile following his release from prison.</p> <h2>7. Salathiel the Immortal by George Croly</h2> <p>Now almost forgotten, the Reverend George Croly was a friend of the Stoker family. In Salathiel the Immortal (1829), there are similarities of predicament between Salathiel and Dracula (as well as with that of Melmoth the Wanderer). Salathiel led the mob which promoted the death of Jesus, in return for which he was condemned to the misery of the undead state. A reshaping of the Wandering Jew legend which underlies so much of the gothic genre, including Melmoth the Wanderer. Like Maturin, Croly was a Church of Ireland clergyman.</p> <h2>8. Varney the Vampire or The Feast of Blood by James Malcolm Rymer or Thomas Pecket Prest</h2> <p>Published in 1847, the year of Stoker's birth, this penny-dreadful contained over 800 pages of often confusing text. It did, however, create some of what would become the stock characters of the vampire tale, especially its central European vampiric aristocrat with ambitions to be master of a great English house and a taste for the blood of young virgins. He is possessed of glittering eyes that fascinate his victims and fang-like teeth. The staking of one of his victims established one of the most potent images of the genre while the elderly and wise Admiral Bell anticipated Van Helsing. Varney represented the first full-length vampire novel in fiction and probably also the first significant fantastic adventure story.</p> <h2>9. The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson</h2> <p>Like Oscar Wilde's slightly later Dorian Gray and Stoker's Dracula, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1887) achieved a dramatic effect by bringing the terror of the primitive, or the peripheral, 'other' home to the heart of empire. A play based on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was put on at the Lyceum by the actor Richard Mansfield in 1888 with limited success. Like Dracula and Frankenstein, it became a major magnet for movie makers and is now embedded in the mass consciousness.</p> <h2>10. Dracula by Bram Stoker</h2> <p>Don't believe those who tell you that Dracula (1897) does not need to be read: no movie to date has done justice to a long and complex work. Arguably the greatest, certainly the most popular gothic novel of them all. It has been reinterpreted afresh by each succeeding generation, a sure sign of a masterpiece, and still generates oceans of critical comment, some of it profound, some unintentionally hilarious, much of it just plain silly. Stoker would have been amazed (he replied to one earnest American correspondent that he clearly knew more about Dracula than he did himself!).</p>",
  "<p>At least one part of Tottenham Hotspur's preparations for the new season is well in hand. They are limbering up nicely to ensure that White Hart Lane is shrouded in its usual atmosphere of confusion, conflict and mystery. Supporters, with only the sedating effects of pessimism to take the edge off their twitchiness, are likely to be feeling subdued before the new season is properly begun. </p> <p>The side have their 12th friendly match of the build-up against Celtic in Glasgow tonight, but all that action has failed to establish a settled environment. With several players injured the generally poor results are no cause for distress, but there will be true angst if a new regime is not bedding in at Spurs. </p> <p>Both Jacques Santini, the manager, and Frank Arnesen, the sporting director, have plenty of experience of those roles at other clubs, but the impression is being given of utter disorientation now that they have come to London. \"I hope to have a meeting with Mr Arnesen and Mr Levy to discuss our functions and how it will work,\" said Santini after the defeat by Cagliari at the weekend, tugging the chairman into the puzzle. </p> <p>It is difficult for fans to understand how job descriptions could not have been agreed long ago, when Santini, before Euro 2004, agreed to give up his post with France. He actually sounds puzzled and resentful over the workload facing his squad. \"The pre-season programme was not devised by me,\" he grumbled on Saturday. </p> <p>So everyone can just forget about Spurs for another year? The oddest thing about the club is that its strains ought to be relieved with ease. It cannot really be beyond mature figures such as Arnesen and Santini to collaborate rather than snipe at one another. Apart from anything else, a decidedly useful squad is waiting patiently for guidance in a reassuringly serene workplace. </p> <p>The composition of the staff may be a bit of a mystery. Some of the new names were probably found on a list that David Pleat left in his desk before being dismissed. Others, such as Basel's Thimoth\u00e9e Atouba, were most likely on Arnesen's laptop well before he parted with PSV Eindhoven. </p> <p>Despite the suggestion of disjointedness in the acquisition policy, fans at many other clubs would envy Spurs. However it has arisen, there is an emerging theme at White Hart Lane. The rejuvenation of the line-up was under way well before Arnesen and Santini came to town and it has gathered pace since they set to work. </p> <p>Thanks to a share issue, there has been money to spend. In January this year, Jermain Defoe arrived to join Freddie Kanout\u00e9 and the presently injured Robbie Keane, giving the club substantial presences in attack, even if the hope of nurturing Helder Postiga was soon abandoned. With that department attended to, eyes have turned to the midfield. </p> <p>Although Tottenham last night pulled out of negotiations to sign Danny Murphy from Liverpool, they have brought in Sean Davis and the Champions League winner Pedro Mendes for the centre of the pitch. With the approaches for Shaun Wright-Phillips of Manchester City and Nottingham Forest's Andy Reid, efforts are being made to invigorate the build-up play. </p> <p>With Ledley King developing apace, Simon Davies to return before long, Paul Robinson bought to resolve the goalkeeping question and Stephen Kelly equipped to take over from the departing Stephen Carr, it is remarkable that no follower of Spurs can spot an uplifting scene at White Hart Lane. Maybe they have been hurt too often, and the club has certainly dismayed them by installing a management regime without being clear as to quite how it will operate. </p> <p>None the less, Spurs may have broken their habit of signing footballers whose value only depreciates. That would be a turning point, since one of the prime areas of distinction between two clubs of inherently similar size is that Arsenal have often been inspired when investing in players. </p> <p>The team will not be battling for major honours, but they could start to carve out a new identity for themselves. Why should they not be a youthful team with a capacity for goalscoring that wins some popularity in the football community at large? It is a sign of how far Spurs have fallen that few are prepared to see them as more than relegation-zone toilers. </p> <p>If the misunderstandings and feuds continue, this may be one more year of dismay. That would be unforgivable when all that is needed is for some proven footballers with their peak years ahead of them to be handled. That achieved, trips to White Hart Lane could be a pleasure rather than a wretched duty.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Team news</strong> </p> <p>Liverpool leave Michael Owen out of their Champions League starting line-up as speculation over his future at Anfield heightens. The theory that he is on the brink of a move to Real Madrid is given more credence by coach Rafael Benitez's decision to name the England striker only on the bench, meaning he will not be cup-tied in European competition for the season unless he sets foot on the pitch. In other words, he's doing one. </p> <p> <strong>Preamble</strong> </p> <p>Sweet Jesus, is it that time already? Michael Owen may be off to Madrid, but sadly I'm going nowhere. So excuse me as I paraphrase the late Bill Hicks and plaster on a fake smile, crack the knuckles of each hand and get ready to plough through another long season of this tedious minute-by-minute tosh one more time. It's so nice to be here with an uplifting message ... </p> <p> <strong>1 min:</strong> AK Graz strikers Kollman and Aufhauser get proceedings underway for the home side, a team I am perfectly happy to admit I had never heard of before yesterday. Graz AK line out in red shirts with white shorts, while Liverpool are playing from left to right in their away kit of yellow, with black trim and black shorts. Excited? I know I am. </p> <p> <strong>2 mins:</strong> Liverpool's signing from Malaga, the right-back Josemi, plays his first pass of the season. It's a long ball down the right from inside his own half which is easily cut out by a Graz AK defender. Moments later, Liverpool win a free-kick a few yards outside the Graz AK penalty area, to the right. Finnan swings it in and Sami Hyypia brings a good save out of Scheuer in the Graz goal with a fine header. Corner for Liverpool. </p> <p> <strong>3 mins:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick in an identical position. Finnan takes it again, but his delivery is poor. </p> <p> <strong>6 mins:</strong> A rash challenge by Standfest earns Liverpool a free-kick in the centre of the field. Steven Gerrard takes it quickly and nothing comes of it. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Stephen Early writes: \"C'mon Barry for crying out loud, cheer up,\" he begs. \"I'm writing up a 7,500 word essay on secularism in France and no matter how badly Liverpool play tonight, they can't be as irritating as that.\" </p> <p>Are you sure, Stephen? Are you? </p> <p> <strong>9 mins:</strong> Cisse takes delivery of a long ball from Riise and promptly loses it. Graz AK counter and win a free-kick a few yards outside the D of the Liverpool box. Kollman shoots, but his effort deflects harmlessly out of play off the Liverpool wall. </p> <p> <strong>10 mins:</strong> Why are Irish people so obsessed with getting what is known as 'the mention' in media circles? It really puzzles me. Take Patrick Falvey, for example: \"You wouldn't manage to mention a few things about Graz would you for the barstoolers amongst us who have no clue,\" he asks. \"Also - will ya try and sneak in a mention for a new ex-pat's website <a href=\"www.irishvibe.com\">www.irishvibe,com</a>?\" </p> <p>It is done. </p> <p> <strong>14 mins:</strong> Milan Baros fluffs an easy chance from about six yards after latching on to a lovely through ball from Steven Gerrard. All he had to do was slot the ball home past Scheuer in the Graz AK goal, but he got the ball caught under his feet and couldn't dig it out in time. </p> <p> <strong>16 mins:</strong> A free-kick wide on the right for Graz AK, which is swung in towards Liverpool's far post. Jerzy Dudek earns his corn by plucking it from the air. Interesting fact: Graz AK currently top the Austrian Super League and won the League and Cup double last year after going 106 years without winning the title. Mad, eh? Oh. </p> <p> <strong>18 mins:</strong> Kollman goes close for Graz AK. He robbed the ball from the toe of a dozing Steven Gerrard in midfield, went on a surging run and, upon being forced wide by Sami Hyypia, tried a shot from distance which fizzed past Jerzy Dudek's right-hand post. </p> <p> <strong>20 mins:</strong> \"For god's sake, the name of our goalkeeper is SCHRANZ, not scheuer. how did you get that name?\" writes Peter Malik from Austria, another man who's far too busy and important to bother with frivolities like capital letters or punctuation. </p> <p>I got the name \"Scheuer\" from the news wires, but as they're wrong more often than not, Peter, I'll bow to your superior knowledge and call him Schranz from now on. </p> <p> <strong>21 mins: Graz AK 0 - 1 Liverpool</strong> Schranz/Scheuer/Whoever is left clutching at thin air as a Steven Gerrard howitzer from just outside the Graz AK box flies past him and into the top left-hand corner. A beautiful strike. </p> <p> <strong>26 mins:</strong> Patrick Falvey is back and, while delighted with his mention, still wants more: \"How are both Finnan and Josemi playing - is one of them in midfield?\" Eh yes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cisse fails to get on the end of a low, hard cross from one of his team-mates whose name I didn't quite get because I was neither listening nor looking. It should have been 2-0. I should have been paying attention. </p> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> Baros fails to bury an easy header from close range, the by-product of a wasted headed opportunity from Cisse. </p> <p>\"If you expose yourselves against us, then we're going to score!\" says Ray Clemence on Five, when asked for his opinions on what the Liverpool players might be thinking about their opposition. Perhaps somebody should tell him they aren't in a lap dancing club. </p> <p> <strong>34 mins:</strong> Three Liverpool substitutes are warming up, but Michael Owen is not one of them. Read into that what you will, although mark my words he'll be off in the next week or two. Baz knows. Baz always knows. Even when he doesn't know. </p> <p>Meanwhile in America, the vice president of Headwater Creative writes in to tell me how lucky I am: \"Hey, I'm stuck here in a non-descript office building (not dissimilar to where you might find David Brent), in Bloomington, Minnesota, on a cold and blustery day,\" says Dave Jarzyna. \"I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat just to see some actual football (or as we Americans proudly call it, soccer). Do you have any idea where Bloomington is?\" </p> <p>No I don't, Dave, but if your company makes money I'll gladly call your bluff and swap lives with you. Do you have a nice girlfriend? House? Car? Income? </p> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Harry Kewell drives a low, hard cross from left to right across the Graz AK box. Cisse can't quite get in front of his marker and <em>just</em> fails to poke it home. </p> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Liverpool are not defending deep at all tonight and are maintaining a defensive line quite far out from goal to facilitate quick counter-attacks. This will come as a relief to fans who were tiring of Gerard Hollier's 11-bats-hanging-from-their-own-cross-bar style of attacking football. </p> <p> <strong>42 mins:</strong> \"Look, mate, we're all looking forward to this next year with you and your fellow musketeers of the minute-by-minute,\" writes David Studer. \"So please, please, drop the whining about your sorry lot, stop making mistakes about people's names and just get on with the vital job of diverting us from our responsibilities.\" </p> <p> I'd love to, David, but unfortunately whining about our sorry lot and making mistakes with people's names is just a part of what we are. </p> <p> <strong>44 mins:</strong> \"Who is playing right back, Finnan or Josemi?\" writes John O'Driscoll, with the kind of urgency that suggests he really, really <em>cares</em> about who is playing right-back for Liverpool in a Uefa Champions League third qualifying round first leg. It's Josemi, John. Finnan is on the right side of midfield. </p> <p> <strong>Half-time</strong> </p> <p> <strong>Half-time high jinx</strong> </p> <p>\"My sister Juliette is very impressed with the speed at which you are writing and following the match - she wonders what you are doing with your left hand?\" writes Duncan Kemp from Lapland. And a ho-ho-ho to you too, Duncan and Juliette. </p> <p>\"You may not be pleased to be back but if you need a pat on the back/kick up the arse - I have been using your commentaries for a pre-season masterclass to persuade my Italian crew to start expressing themselves a little in their minute by minute reports for the club websites - make of that what you will,\" harrumphs Mike Ingram. That's very flattering, Mike, if not a little scary and distrubing. </p> <p>Now would you all just stop moaning. This time last week I was sitting drinking lots of beer in the sunshine outside a bar in Amsterdam, looking at gorgeous women passing by as barges chugged up and down an adjacent canal. The most pressing concern I had was what I was going to have for my dinner and where I was going to go afterwards. Now look at me and what I'm doing - is it any wonder I'm cranky? </p> <p> <strong>Craven plea for employment:</strong> \"Tell Dave Jarzyna that I'd love to be in Bloomington and if he's willing to give this MBA a shot, I'll get a satellite system put in my home there and we can take long lunches when necessary to watch live football...er, soccer,\" writes Lee Warren. </p> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Liverpool get the second half underway in the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium. There are no changes on either side and Michael Owen has not signed for Real Madrid since last we spoke. </p> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick in the corner, on the right. After much pushing and shoving in the box, Ehmann gets booked and Finnan promptly wastes the free-kick. </p> <p> <strong>48 mins:</strong> It's all getting very scrappy and niggly. It sure ain't pretty. </p> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> After a mazy run down the left, Harry Kewell rolls the ball across the edge of the penalty area, to Milan Baros. Schranz gets down quickly to save his low, scuffed effort. </p> <p> <strong>51 mins:</strong> Gerrard gives ball away again (shades of Euro 2004, England v France, anyone?) and Kollman is released one on one against Dudek. Offside! </p> <p> <strong>53 mins:</strong> Kewell lays the ball off to Baros on the edge of the Graz AK penalty area again, but the Czech striker - who I absolutely love because his goalscoring exploits at Euro 2004 paid for my summer holidays - is bundled off the ball before he can turn and shoot. </p> <p> <strong>54 mins:</strong> \"I've been a Liverpool fan forever and personally I've always thought Owen was over rated,\" writes Michael Furlong. \"A low work rate and a one-style striker. Even if he tried harder it would be easier to forgive him. Owen leaving. So sad. Too bad. Sunny weather here in San Francisco. The East Bay Senior Soccer League kicks off in September. My team moves up a division. Life is good.\" </p> <p>At least somebody's happy. </p> <p> <strong>56 mins:</strong> Kollman goes close again, but doesn't trouble Jerzy Dudek. Liverpool are completely in control of this game, but occasional sloppiness from their midfielders mean the home side aren't out of it yet. Do you see what I'm trying to do there? Do you? I'm trying to generate excitement wherre there just isn't any to be found. Is it working? Nah, didn't think so. </p> <p> <strong>58 mins:</strong> Another Liverpool attack down the left, another ball into Baros on the edge of the Graz AK penalty area. Again, nothing comes of it. Baros is playing with his back to goal and just isn't being given room to turn. </p> <p> <strong>60 mins:</strong> A brilliant save from the agile Schranz in the Graz Ak goal, who tips a headed effort from Baros around his own post and out for a corner. Baros's effort had come from a corner swung in by Steve Finnan. Good effort, fantastic save. </p> <p> <strong>62 mins:</strong> Bazina, who is a Croatian international, replaces Skoro, who isn't.</p> <p> <strong>63 mins:</strong> \"I am a Liverpool supporter from England currently living in sunny Los Angeles, California trying to follow the match on the Guardian website and work at the same time,\" writes Alex Hill. \"It's tricky but I'm managing it - these pesky Americans wouldn't appreciate it if they knew what I was up to but luckily we don't have an IT department to check on these things. Anyway, do Baros and Cisse look like they are working well together up front?\" </p> <p>Well Alex, thank you for getting to the point eventually. To answer your question - no they don't. Baros looks a shadow of the man who swept all before him in Euro 2004, while Cisse is having what can only be described as 'a shocker'. Never mind working well together, they don't even look as if anyone's taken the trouble to introduce them to each other. </p> <p> <strong>66 mins:</strong> A brilliant 25-yard volley from Steven Gerrard fizzes past Schranz in the Graz AK goal, but his effort is ruled out by the linesman's flag. Having seen it three times now, I still have no idea why it was disallowed. Nobody was in an offside position, there were no obvious infringements and it was an absolute screamer. A very odd decision which Steven Gerrard has taken far more stoically than I would have. It's not every day you fire home a zinger like that. </p> <p> <strong>69 mins:</strong> \"Bloomington, Minnesota, is 500 miles north of Chicago near the Canada border and the proud home of the Mall of America - the biggest freaking mall in the country,\" writes Dave Jarzyna (34 mins). \"It sits on the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, which once hosted Pele, Beckenbauer and the rest of the New York Cosmos against our very own Minnesota Kicks of the North American Soccer League.\" </p> <p>Very informative, but no mention from Dave over whether Lee Warren can have a job. You have to love the Yanks though - imagine being so utterly bereft of culture that you're reduced to boasting about how big your local shopping centre is. Fantastic. </p> <p> <strong>72 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Michael Owen for Milan Baros. Sorry, did I type Michael Owen? I meant to type Salif Diao. A slip of the fingers is all it was. Also, a man named Sick has replaced somebody on the Graz AK side. </p> <p> <strong>76 mins:</strong> John O'Driscoll has mailed in to tell me that elsewhere in Europe, Juventus are 2-1 down at home to Djurgarden, who I've never heard of. That's all well and good, John, but how are Sunderland getting on against Crewe in the really big match of the night?</p> <p> <strong>77 mins: Graz AK 0 - 2 Liverpool</strong> <br> Steven Gerrard settles the match with a low diagonal drive into the bottom corner from the right corner of the six yard box. His goal was teed up by Harry Kewell after excellent work down the left by Cisse. </p> <p> <strong>81 mins:</strong> \"Believe me, I'm not boasting about the Mall of America,\" counters Dave Jarzyna in an email headed 'Be nice'. Could this be the same Dave Jarzyna, incidentally, who still isn't prepared to give Lee Warren MBA a job. C'mon Dave - could you not have him making the tea or something? He sounds desperate. Perhaps he'll work for food. </p> <p>Liverpool substitution: Stephen Warnock for Steven Gerrard. </p> <p> <strong>82 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Finnan off, Darren Potter on for his competitive debut for Liverpool. He looks about 12 years old and more Harry Potter than anything else. Who are these children? </p> <p> <strong>85 mins:</strong> Warnock has been getting stuck in all over the shop ever since he came on. I do like his swagger and the cut of his jib. Or should that be spelt gib? I dunno - I'll delete the incorrect version when I'm going through my post-match routine of correcting typographical errors, and inserting factually correct information and funny jokes. </p> <p><strong>89 mins:</strong> Never mind this Euro-tripe - John O'Driscoll has written in to tell me that Sunderland are whupping Crewe 2-1. That's more like it. As Liverpool waste time over a throw-in, Graz AK's Sick looks ... sick as a parrot.</p> <p> <strong>90 mins:</strong> Sick gets booked for a poor challenge on Cisse. Bleeeeurrgghhhh!!!</p> <p> <strong>Full time</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! It's over. Liverpool take what should be an unassailable 2-0 lead home with them for the second leg. Thanks for tuning in and I'll look forward to hearing from you all again next week, and the week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that, and the week after that and the week after that. <em>Repeat to fade.</em> </p> <p><strong>Graz AK:</strong> Scheuer, Tokic, Ehmann, Ramusch, Standfest, Muratovic, Skoro, Amerhauser, Pogatetz, Aufhauser, Kollmann.<br><strong> Subs:</strong> Almer, Daniel Pirker, Bazina, Sick, Majstorovic, Plassnegger. </p> <p> <strong>Liverpool:</strong> Dudek, Finnan, Hyypia, Carragher, Riise, Kewell, Gerrard, Hamann, Josemi, Cisse, Baros. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Kirkland, Henchoz, Potter, Owen, Diao, Sinama Pongolle, Warnock. </p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Alain Sars (France)</p>",
  "<p>It sounded like the ultimate retro break - a state-subsidised stay in a government-owned log cabin, maybe with a little communal tractor-driving thrown in. Such fun prospects from the Soviet era are still available in North Korea, Cuba - and New Labour's Britain, according to a Conservative policy document on potential savings at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>Deep in the woods, three relics of socialism offer strength through joy at a \u00a33.7m loss last year, courtesy of the Forestry Commission, say the Tories. The nearest to me in Leeds is Keldy in the North York moors national park, and we were soon on the way there, knapsacks stuffed with Tizer and song sheets from revolutionary socialist student days in the 1960s. </p> <p>\"You'll be held up in Pickering by the traction engine rally,\" said Sue Cox's cheerful voice from cabin control, when my wife and I rang to check arrangements. And we were; creeping, steaming monsters (how can so much power create so little speed?) paralysed the roads for miles. Here was authentic nostalgia and Soviet-style inefficiency; we had nothing to lose but our place in the queues.</p> <p>But that was it as far as Michael Howard's nightmare of Komsomol dachas were concerned. Once you get on the road to Helmsley, brown tourist signs to \"Keldy Forest Cabins\" abound - nothing hidden or surreptitiously socialist here. So do estate cars full of the sort of cheery families you meet at Center Parcs, heading for something basically similar, though simpler. Typical. The bourgeois take over everything. </p> <p>There are no glorious names from the socialist era either - Aneurin Bevan, Barbara Castle - carved on the cabin walls. Like the other two sites, in Cornwall and Perthshire, Keldy has just been completely torn down and rebuilt, which turns out to explain the <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/news/story/0,7445,1271602,00.html\">Tories' suggestion</a> that Forest Holidays (an arm of the Forestry Commission which is about to become a public-private partnership) is mired in loss. The 141 cabins and 5,000 caravan pitches make an annual profit of about \u00a31m. The year the Tories picked on saw the budget skewed by major investment.</p> <p>Cabins like ours - whose workaday name, Number 52, was its only Soviet feature - arrived as \u00a370,000 flatpacks which were assembled among the trees this winter. \"Cabin\" is a fanciful name, too, for something Hansel and Gretel would consider a mansion. Think \"lodge\" or even \"villa\". These are Scandinavian-style chalets of the type you see at Langdale in the Lake District and other smartish time-shares. They have mod cons which some Forest Holidays veterans consider extremely pansy. Dishwashers, even. TVs and videos. </p> <p>\"Some regulars were a bit surprised,\" says Sue Cox, who runs the 62-cabin site with her husband Dave and a handful of green-shirted Forestry bods (another, very slight, uniformy nod in the direction of the Kremlin). \"They talk about the days when they were children and they had to climb a vertical ladder to get to their bunks.\" Now, the children's bedroom is up an elegant wooden flight of bannistered steps, complete with retractable stairgate.</p> <p>What do you do? This is Center Parcs without the flumes and Jacuzzi. There's ping pong, communal barbecueing and a huge emphasis on nature. See deer from your bedroom window over morning tea. Track a pheasant sauntering past your big, Californian-style deck. Tick off the birds, insects and reptiles from big recognition charts in the Children's Room. This is the sort of holiday break of which a certain type of Guardian reader dreams.</p> <p>There are also extras. Keldy has a turreted squash court, the only relic of a hideous Edwardian shooting lodge built here by the Reckitt family, chemical magnates of Hull. Ha! Their property now belongs to the people (sort-of). There's also a pretty cast-iron certainty of seeing badgers. On our one evening's stay, we had an excellent spell in the hide. I'm convinced our badger waved.</p> <p>The walks are also five-star. Not simply the chance to wander for miles in the vast loveliness of the North York Moors, but full of well-marked circuits in the dark, beguiling forests of Cropton and Dalby. Biking is even better and very much Keldy's preferred method of transport. Short-term hire is quite pricey - nothing socialist about \u00a38 a day - but there are good family and week-long deals.</p> <p>Children buzz about the whole site safely on bikes or foot, and there's quite a likelihood of meeting extended family parties - three-generation holidays are common - and wholesome groups organised by churches or the Inner Wheel. As great escapers from anything resembling a camp, Penny and I were extremely pleased to find the New Inn, Cropton, less than three miles from Keldy, whose pub micro-brewery produced Britain's champion bitter two years ago. The menu groans with such excellent things as steak and ale pie.</p> <p>No, Soviet it ain't. But Keldy has some of the simplicity of former times and, if you like camping, there's a bit of make-do feel, even to the luxury new cabins. Ours was for six, but that means two people using a sofa bed in the main, kitchen-and-sitting room. Given the current hard times at Conservative central office, I can't think of a better place for a shadow cabinet brainstorming and get-to-know-you weekend.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Martin stayed in a six-person cabin at Keldy. Prices start at \u00a3285 per cabin for a three-night break between September 4 and October 12. A seven-night break in September starts at \u00a3495. <a href=\"http://www.forestholidays.co.uk\">forestholidays.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"mailto:info@forestholidays.co.uk\">info@forestholidays.co.uk</a>, 0131 314 6100</p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard, the leader of the Tory party, will today highlight pupil violence in the classroom, claiming that a crackdown by a Conservative government would see heads given new powers to tackle problem children. </p> <p>Ten pupils a day are being expelled from English classrooms following an assault on a teacher, he claimed. </p> <p>Ahead of his major speech in Middlesborough today, Mr Howard's office released a dossier on violence in schools documenting a rising number of exclusions.</p> <p>It cites Office of National Statistics figures reveal there were 17,000 exclusions - temporary and permanent - in the last term of last year. Of those, 4,000 were excluded for attacks on adults. The dossier goes on to list high profile cases of violence in schools over the past three years. </p> <p>Previous government figures for last year showed that 9,290 children of secondary school age were permanently excluded, 245 fewer than the previous year and 3,000 fewer than in 1997.</p> <p>As part of a wider speech on crime and disorder Mr Howard will today link discipline problems in classrooms with anti-social behaviour elsewhere. </p> <p>\"Many people now believe they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions,\" he will say. \"It's someone else's fault, or something else's fault - the environment, society, the government.\"</p> <p>The key proposal in the Conservative policy, which is not new, is to give headteachers the last say in exclusions. </p> <p>The Labour government brought in pupil appeal panels, which allow a pupil and their families to contest an exclusion. They have come into criticism for not taking the headteacher and teachers' opinions into account, and undermining their authority. </p> <p>In September 2002 a row kicked off at Glynn technology college in Surrey where two pupils were returned despite making death threats against a teacher. The then-education secretary Estelle Morris stepped in and ordered the children out of the school.</p> <p>The panels have since been reformed so that they have to include a serving or ex-heateacher and they have to consider the needs of all children in a school, not just the excluded pupil. They have been justified as a last resort for pupils to appeal against a decision they may feel is unfair.</p> <p>Today's dossier, which also highlights the Conservative policy, promises to \"give control back to heads, teachers and governors\". </p> <p>\"We will abolish appeals panels, re-establishing the authority of heads and governors to deal with unacceptable standards of behaviour.\"</p> <p>Last year there were around 1,500 appeals - out of nearly 10,000 exclusions. One hundred and forty nine pupils were reinstated.</p>",

  "Michael Howard today reopened the row over racism within the police by pledging to scrap the \"politically correct\" requirement on officers to record the ethnicity of all people stopped on the street. <p>The Conservative leader made the controversial call in a speech on crime in Middlesbrough aimed at putting \"clear blue water\" between the Tories and Labour on the issue of law and order in the run-up to next year's likely general election. </p> <p>Such is the importance the party is attaching to the keynote address, which covered all aspects of law and order, that Mr Howard flew back from a holiday to give the speech. </p> <p>He said the police had been undermined by political correctness and would receive backing for \"zero tolerance\" policing under a Tory government. </p> <p><b>Measuring inequality</b></p> <p>More controversially, Home Office plans to give all people stopped by police a receipt detailing their race and why they were stopped would be scrapped in the event of a Tory victory at the next general election.</p> <p>The receipt scheme was recommended by the Macpherson inquiry into the racist killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence as a way of discouraging police from using \"stop powers\" disproportionately against black and Asian people. </p> <p>It has been piloted in seven areas of the country and is due to go nationwide by April 1 next year. </p> <p>Overall race totals will be monitored in a bid to crack down on officers who stop too many black people and Asians; at present records are kept only of people who are stopped and then searched. </p> <p>Mr Howard's speech came just a month after the police were accused of \"Islamophobia\" when figures showed the number of Asians targeted by stop and search powers had risen 302%. </p> <p>The number of overall searches increased dramatically, but the figures showed Asians saw the highest increases in stop and searches under the Terrorism Act powers, rising 302% from 744 in 2001-02 to 2,989 in 2002-03. </p> <p>Black people were also six times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than whites, the figures revealed. </p> <p><b>Shades of Hague</b></p> <p>Mr Howard's speech was remarkably similar to one made by William Hague in December 2000 - also just months before a general election campaign - in which he defended the right to stop and search and said the Macpherson report had been used to dub every police officer a racist.</p> <p>Even before Mr Howard's speech had been delivered, it attracted a chorus of disapproval. Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said Mr Howard appeared determined to \"make the situation worse\". </p> <p>He said: \"There are some corners that cannot be cut. Last month the government admitted that too many people from ethnic minorities were being stopped and searched. Michael Howard seems determined to make this situation worse.\" </p> <p>Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, which encourages ethnic minorities to participate in the democratic process, accused Mr Howard of \"sanctioning the demonisation of black and Asian youth\". The Tory policy was \"deeply disappointing\", he said. </p> <p>Mr Woolley attacked the system of stop and search as a \"draconian, humiliating, 'sledgehammer to crack a nut' approach to crime\". </p> <p>The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, also defended the use of receipts, saying it aided community relations.</p> <p><b>'PC mumbo jumbo'</b></p> <p>In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Howard pledged to scrap the electronic tagging programme, which allows prisoners out of jail early.</p> <p>Mr Howard said 3,500 crimes, including nine serious sex crimes, had been committed by tagged offenders since the tagging scheme was introduced in 1999. </p> <p>\"I have had enough of the culture of political correctness,\" Mr Howard said. \"The clear distinction between right and wrong has been lost in sociological mumbo jumbo and politically correct nonsense.\"</p> <p>Pledging to increase prison capacity, he said: \"It's not a question of if we build new prisons, it is a question of how many new prisons we build and what kind of prisons they are.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard went on to dispute the accuracy of the British Crime Survey, which the government claims gives the most accurate picture of crime trends in the UK. </p> <p>The Tory leader noted that the survey excluded an estimated 12m crimes a year. </p> <p>Recorded crime statistics showed crime in England and Wales had risen by 85% in the last five years and violent crime by 83%, Mr Howard said, suggesting that these statistics were \"the most reliable\". </p> <p><b>Personal responsibility</b></p> <p>He said there had been a \"dramatic decline\" in personal responsibility and he disputed the validity of the term \"antisocial behaviour\" to describe activities such as drunkenness, intimidation and overturning litter bins. </p> <p>\"That behaviour is not just antisocial - it's wrong ... and people shouldn't be allowed to get away with it,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions; it's someone else's or something else's fault: the environment, society, the government. </p> <p>\"All too often, teachers cannot discipline pupils let alone expel them from school,\" he added.</p> <p>\"We will introduce enforceable home-school contracts that spell out both parents' and pupils' responsibilities, and we will give heads complete control over expulsion. </p> <p>\"If they decide to expel a disruptive pupil, they will not be second-guessed by an outside panel.\" </p> <p>The Tories would introduce a \"strong legal presumption\" in favour of equal rights for parents in a child's upbringing so that more families could benefit from a father's influence, Mr Howard said.</p>",
  "<p>In a few days' time a succession of bodies honed to the purest, most extreme form of physical perfection will run, jump and spin into action in Athens. The athletes competing in the 2004 Olympics have trained to a level unachievable for most people. The benefits are obvious - medals for the best, fame and admiration around the globe, and a serotonin buzz without parallel. </p> <p>But what of the downside? While medical experts universally agree about the health benefits of physical activity, there is an optimum level. Does the physical thrashing of the body at its peak leave it weak and mangled in the post-competition years or is it an investment that pays long-term dividends? </p> <p>According to Dr Greg Whyte, director of science and research at the English Institute of Sport, the key to long-term health for Olympic athletes is not to cross the fine line between \"super physiology\" and damage. </p> <p>\"Getting this right is dependent on how well the athlete is managed,\" he says. \"There are a fair number who cross the line and this can result in unexplained under-performance syndrome, an ME-like condition that affects about 10% of elite athletes training in endurance sports.\" </p> <p>Osteopenia, a reduction in bone mineral density, is a condition that can cause long-term damage to both male and female athletes. It can lead to an increase in stress fractures although Whyte says that no one has yet proved a link with cause and effect of intensive training. </p> <p>He and his team are studying exercise-induced asthma and look ing at the impact of sports such as swimming and skiing where very high volumes of air go through the lungs on a prolonged basis. Environmental pollution absorbed into the lungs at much higher levels than that of non-competitive swimmers and skiers is thought to be a factor in the development of long-term asthma. </p> <p>Anabolic steroids, which are, of course, banned but have been used by some athletes in recent years, can also cause long-term damage to the body, including early heart disease, increased tendon damage, liver disease and changes in the composition of blood cholesterol, increasing the risks of coronary artery disease. </p> <p>Eating disorders are another occupational hazard for Olympic athletes. Research carried out at the University of Leeds found that almost one in 10 of Britain's top female distance runners had some kind of eating disorder. In the short term, reducing body fat does improve athletic performance as oxygen can be transported to the muscles more quickly. However, in the longer term it can lead to the loss of muscle bulk as well as causing osteoporosis and kidney damage. </p> <p>Managing Olympic athletes so that they can continue to raise the bar of achievement for the human body ever higher has become a highly sophisticated science. But the sheer complexity of the combination between genes, environment and training means that it is impossible to always achieve the ultimate super-physiology while at the same time insulating the body from long-term damage. Most elite athletes follow all the state-of-the-art advice available in the hope that they will not only win medals but also glide into an agile middle and old age. Then they unscientifically cross their fingers and hope for the best. </p> <p> <strong> Christopher Dean, 46</strong> With Jayne Torvill, gold for ice dancing in 1984, Sarajevo, and bronze in 1994, Lillehammer <br> </p> <p>Most of our training took place on the ice and we practised for about five hours a day. Jayne was my weights workout and I spent a lot of time lifting her. But it wasn't the conventional sort of weightlifting where you bend your knees - we always performed things off balance, which puts a lot of strain on the arms and on the lower back. Jayne used to hang off my neck quite a lot, too. Groin strains were common because of the stretches and extensions we were always doing. There was also a lot of mental stress associated with the Olympics. Everything you work for comes down to one routine of four minutes. </p> <p>When we competed as amateurs in the Olympics we would practise all year for three or four events. When we turned professional, we did eightshows a week - at the weekend we did two shows back to back - with 60 lifts per show. We didn't work out how many miles we skated but at the end of each show we would have lost 2-3lb in fluids. The hardest thing would be having to perform even if we got a bug or food poisoning. After a performance I would look like the Michelin man with ice packs on both sides of my legs, on my lower back and on my neck. </p> <p>We carried on performing together until five or six years ago. Now I choreograph shows for Stars on Ice. I have some arthritis in my knees and degenerative discs in my back because of the amount of lifting I did, but for a 46-year-old I'm OK. I've trained my body and my muscles to be a certain shape and if I maintain that, things aren't so bad. But after a hard day's choreographing, I tend to end up with the physiotherapist. </p> <p>One of the great health benefits of spending lots of time on ice is that I've got fewer wrinkles than people who spend lots of time in the sun, like tennis players and golfers. </p> <p>There was a sadistic pleasure in pushing my body to the pitch I did but I don't still hanker after that physical perfection; I've let loose now, I don't think it's healthy to stay that wound up for ever. These days I think that people who push their bodies to the ultimate goal have probably gone a bit too far and I don't think that's healthy. But I don't regret the way I pushed my body. Oh gosh, no. I wouldn't change a thing. </p> <p><strong> Colin Jackson, 37</strong> Silver medal for the 110m hurdles in 1996, Atlanta<br> </p> <p>For my training as a sprinter I had to push my body by lifting weights and be as flexible as a gymnast, as well as the running. It was a total combination of work and I would have to spend at least four hours a day on it. It was hard when the weather was dark or gloomy but I could never miss a session because then I knew it would be easier to miss a second, third or fourth training session too. </p> <p>I did push my body to its limits and because the body can only do certain things I had to train my mind to be stronger than my body. As a result, there were a few occasions when my commitment to training was too intense and my body couldn't handle it. At those times my body would literally crash and collapse. My knees have always been my biggest problem. I have had seven operations on them - one to realign the patella and the others because of cartilage problems. I've been told that the weaker the muscles around my knees become, the more chance I have of developing arthritis, so I have to keep them in shape if I want to avoid that. </p> <p>At the moment there isn't any arthritis there and I'm not doing any running. It's way too much hard work to start that again. I did start training again with guys who are still competing but I started training too intensely - it's all or nothing for me. I've just come back from a skiing holiday and if I'm bored I'll do press-ups and sit- ups, but that's it at the moment. </p> <p>I think that the most important thing any Olympic athlete can do to preserve their health long-term is to know when it's the right time to retire. If you want to retain your physical health, you have to know when to call it a day. I made sure I did everything I was supposed to do, which is why my career lasted for 18 years. I really looked after myself and I had great medical backup. It's a legacy of those years that I can still do things like the splits. </p> <p><strong> Liz McColgan, 40</strong> Silver medal for the 10,000m in 1988, Seoul<br> </p> <p>I used to train for about three and a half hours a day. I would run 145 miles a week for three weeks and on the fourth week I would have an easy week running 105 miles. I also went to the gym a couple of times a week, lifting weights and doing circuit training. These days I still run - I started when I was 11, so it's a way of life. I just go out running once a day now rather than the two or three times a day I used to go out. </p> <p>I think that, considering the amount of training I used to do, my body has done pretty well. I've got arthritis in my feet but so has my sister and she doesn't do much exercise so it's probably a genetic thing rather than caused by my running. </p> <p>I did have one serious problem with my knee but that was a result of wearing ill-fitting orthotics. I've got a lot of energy as a result of all the exercise I do. I feel it's good to push your body to its limits. Every time I push my body further than I've pushed it before it makes me feel good. Seeing how far I could push myself is what gives me a thrill in running. I still time myself and I can still achieve the same highs I achieved during the Olympics. </p> <p><strong> Mary Peters, 65</strong> Gold medal for the pentathlon (hurdles, shot, high jump, long jump and 200m) in 1972, Munich<br> </p> <p>I started competing at 16 and carried on until I was 35. I used to train for two hours a day because I was an amateur and athletics was just a hobby for me. With weightlifting, pentathlon, high jump, long jump and 200m, my body got a lot of abuse but I've just had my 65th birthday and am enjoying really good health. I've never been in hospital apart from one very minor thing overnight. I don't have any problems in my joints or anywhere else. </p> <p>I would have 860lb weights on my shoulders and would do one-arm jerks with 120lb weights. I never warmed up properly the way athletes are taught to today, I never drank three litres of water the way people are advised today and I never ate pasta before an event as athletes are advised to do today. I used to eat steak and salad and I'm absolutely fine. I ran a gym for 20 years so I kept myself pretty fit and I've just been trekking in New Zealand to raise money for Mencap, walking 100 miles over the course of eight days. </p> <p>When I was training for the Olympics I did work hard but it was just a hobby; it wasn't torture and I didn't push myself beyond my limits. I can remember one athlete saying that he was sick after every training session and that if he wasn't sick he hadn't trained properly. That didn't happen to me. These days, athletes do a lot of warming up and warming down but I just didn't have the time. I did pull a hamstring one season and I got tennis elbow early on because of poor technique in my shot-putting but that was all. I think the standard of Olympics athletes has improved enormously. I did it for fun and if I was successful that was a bonus. </p> <p>I think physical activity has always been important in the evolution of men and women and I think people move around less than they did 50 years ago. Exercising makes me feel so much better mentally and physically. </p> <p>I'm not quite as supple as I used to be but I'm lucky not to have suffered any ill effects from competing at Olympic level. I think it's partly down to genes; my brother is also fairly active and in good health. I feel as if I'm 18 even though I don't look it. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Colin Jackson is a member of the commentary team providing live coverage of the Olympics on BBC1 and BBC2, August 13-29.</p>",

  "<p>The Iraq war is, unsurprisingly, a powerful presence in this year's Fringe programme. There is already one full-length play on the subject, The Pull of Negative Gravity, which opened at the Traverse on Sunday. Written by Jonathan Lichtenstein, it concerns a Welsh soldier's return from the war to his family, whose farm is ravaged by the effects of foot-and-mouth. The story is drawn from Lichtenstein's experiences with former soldiers working on an oil rig, but this makes it no less topical. \"We made a show for now,\" says the director, Gregory Thomson. \"Whether the war was just or not, we have to deal with the consequences.\" </p> <p>Many Fringe directors have chosen to do this by updating Greek classics. The Trojan Women, a show on the Royal Mile, discusses the impact on women of modern wars, including Iraq. Meanwhile, Women of Troy, Women of War, at Venue 45, adds real testimonies from homecoming soldiers and references to the events at Abu Ghraib to Euripides's tragedy. It is produced by a group from West Michigan university and \"everyone in the cast knows someone in Iraq\", says the director, Joan Herrington. The show's props master was recently recalled to the Gulf. </p> <p>Sideswipes at Dubya remain the easiest, and thus the most plentiful laughs in town. But many comedians, such as Paul Tonkinson, Laurie Kilmartin and Frank Sanazi &amp; the Iraq Pack, have devised more considered responses to the war. In his show I Didn't Vote for George W, at C Central, Brian Longwell takes a direct approach, questioning how much it cost and \"What I'd have done differently.\" </p> <p>At Pod Deco, Tina C's Manifesto Show is a more light-hearted attack on Republican politics and warmongering. Tina C - aka comedian Chris Green - is a sweet-hearted country and western singer with a political conscience. Green's act began as a way of dealing with the status of women, and then became politicised by 9/11. </p> <p>In Manifesto Show Tina reports back on her experiences entertaining the troops in Iraq, before launching her bid for the 2008 presidency. For Green, it's important to preserve the complexity of the subject. \"I don't like one-dimensional comedy when the comedian colludes with the audience saying, 'We all think this, don't we',\" he says. But is any comedian brave enough to admit being pro-Bush?</p>",

  "I am delighted to be here in Middlesbrough with Ray Mallon this morning. <p>Ray has proved that if you want to cut crime, you can cut crime. He has shown that with decisive action and clear direction you can begin the process of urban renewal. And he has demonstrated that when local communities pull together they can start to improve everyone's quality of life. </p> <p><b>Rising Crime</b></p> <p>This is the reality of Britain today. Parents are afraid to let their children walk to school. Women fear intimidation from hooded youths as they walk home at night. And couples stay in rather than run the gauntlet of the binge drinkers who have taken over many of our towns and city centres. </p> <p>Crime undermines the quality of all our lives - and as with most failings in society it is the poorest who suffer the most. People living in deprived areas are more than twice as likely to be mugged as those living in better off neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Rising crime has left people across Britain feeling powerless and insecure. And in many places they worry that the police have become powerless too - remote and distant, unable to deal with the issues that concern their neighbourhoods the most. </p> <p><b>Crime statistics</b> </p> <p>Criminologists and commentators frequently try to downplay the problem by saying that the fear of crime is actually greater than crime itself. They appear blind to the fact that disorder and violence have became a fact of daily life in many communities across Britain. </p> <p>government ministers cite the British Crime Survey as evidence that there has been a steady decline in crime over the last nine years. But the BCS excludes lots of crimes from its calculations - such as murder, crimes against children under 16, sexual offences, dealing and taking drugs and shoplifting. It is estimated that around 12 million crimes a year don't even make it onto the BCS radar. </p> <p>The most reliable crime statistics - those crimes actually recorded by the police - show that crime in Englandand Waleshas risen by almost 850,000 in the last five years. </p> <p>While burglary and car crime have fallen: gun crime has doubled; robbery has gone up by more than half; and, most damning of all, violent crime has increased by 83%. Last year it hit the one million mark for the first time ever. That is 3,000 violent crimes every day - and more than a hundred violent crimes every hour. </p> <p><b>Respect and Responsibility</b></p> <p>There are many factors which have contributed to the breakdown of law and order in Britain today. In many ways the police, the courts and the prison service are simply picking up the pieces of other people's failures. </p> <p> As a society we are in danger of being overrun by values which eat away at people's respect for themselves, each other, their homes and their neighbourhood. </p> <p> Most damaging of all has been the dramatic decline in personal responsibility. Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions. It's someone else's, or something else's fault - the environment, society, the government.</p> <p> Remember the lines from West Side Story, when the gang of hoods try to excuse their actions: \"I'm depraved on account of I'm deprived,\" says one. \"Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease\" says another. West Side Story may have been written by an American at the tail end of the 1950s, but these attitudes are all too prevalent in British society today.</p> <p>These excuses shift the balance away from the yob, the shoplifter, the joy-rider, the mugger, any criminal, on to someone or something else. What more harmful message could we send than to say: \"It's not your fault, it is society's fault\"?</p> <p> And while responsibility has declined, rights have proliferated. \"I've got my rights\" is the verbal equivalent of two-fingers to authority. There is now a palpable sense of outrage that \"so-called\" human rights have tipped the balance of justice in favour of the criminal and the wrong-doer - rather than the victim and the law abider. </p> <p>The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of rights have left us in an ethical quagmire, which is undermining our fight against crime. The clear distinction between right and wrong has been lost in sociological mumbo-jumbo and politically correct nonsense. </p> <p>Just consider that phrase \"anti-social behaviour\" which we hear so often today. Eighteen-year-olds out after a night's drinking, overturning litter bins, pushing each other around, intimidating others - in my language, that behaviour is not just anti-social - it's wrong. Yes: it's wrong. And people shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. </p> <p>Decent, hard-working people understand this. But they also understand that while politicians and the police must take the lead in tackling crime and disorder, families and communities have a part to play too. They know that there is a right path for our society - one based on personal responsibility, moderation, truthfulness, honesty, and liberty under the law. </p> <p> Ask these people what they think is at the root of many of the problems we face in society today, and they will say obvious things. The things many politicians have been too frightened to say for far too long.</p> <p> Why do some parents allow their children out until the early hours?</p> <p>How does it help parents instil discipline if they are told that they cannot smack their children?</p> <p>Why can't teachers discipline disruptive pupils any more?</p> <p>It is to the people who ask these questions, who have been resolute but silent for so long - the backbone of our country - that I am addressing my comments to today. </p> <p>Conservatives will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. We will put their rights first. </p> <p>Like them, I have had enough of the culture of political correctness - which is designed to blur the distinction between right and wrong. </p> <p>And like them, I have had enough of excuses for poor behaviour and crime.</p> <p>If we are to tackle crime, we must begin to challenge these attitudes head on.</p> <p><b>Failings in the Criminal Justice System</b></p> <p>But we must also tackle the fundamental problems at the heart of our criminal justice system.</p> <p>It's not just about money. This year we will spend \u00a319bn on our criminal justice system - the equivalent of \u00a3316 for every man, woman and child in the country. Home Office spending has risen by 65since 1997. Yet crime is still rising. </p> <p>It's about culture, belief, approach. At every step of the way, our criminal justice system has become overwhelmed by political correctness and paperwork.</p> <p>Political correctness and paperwork are undermining our police. The police can only do their job properly if they are able to intervene, to confront and to take action against crime and anti-social behaviour. They cannot police our streets if they have one hand tied behind their back, or if paperwork keeps them chained to their desks.</p> <p>So great is the deluge of paperwork that, for every extra police officer Labour have recruited, almost one extra bureaucrat has had to be employed. So great is the number of pen-pushers that they will not fit into the new Home Office that Labour are building.</p> <p>Mismanagement is rife in both the Crown Prosecution Service and our courts. Seven per cent of cases are abandoned because of errors by the CPS. In London alone 1,400 defendants went free last year because of delays in gathering evidence. A fifth of all trials don't start when they are meant to. </p> <p>Labour have downgraded prison as a punishment with the introduction of their early release scheme. Since it was introduced in 1999, more than 3,500 crimes have been committed by prisoners on early release - including nine serious sexual crimes.</p> <p>And finally we have failed to invest in new prison capacity, thereby constraining the ability of our courts to send persistent, serious and dangerous criminals to prison. </p> <p>This is the politics of the mad house. The first duty of government - any government - is to protect the public and maintain law and order. But government in Britain today is manifestly failing in that duty today.</p> <p><b>Solutions </b></p> <p>Restoring law and order to Britain will be a priority for the Conservatives.</p> <p>How? First, rebuilding respect. </p> <p>Children, especially boys, benefit hugely from a male influence in their lives. Of course this isn't always possible because a large number of men simply abandon their responsibilities as fathers. But there are many fathers in Britain today who do want to play their part, yet cannot get access to their children. </p> <p>Conservatives believe that there should be a strong legal presumption in favour of both parents having equal rights in the upbringing of their children. This change to our family law will mean that fathers are much more likely to remain involved in their children's lives even when families split up. </p> <p>Discipline in school is also essential if children are to learn respect for authority at an early age. I suspect that I am just one of millions of parents and grandparents bewildered and horrified by the breakdown in discipline in our schools. </p> <p>Violence in the class room is rising - up nine-fold since 1997. Yet all too often teachers cannot discipline pupils, let alone expel them from school. And it is often teachers - not pupils - who find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Only recently we had the nonsense of a teacher taken to the crown court to stand trial by jury because she had - in jest - put some tape over the mouth of a child. </p> <p>Disruptive and violent pupils don't just ruin their own education - they ruin that of every other child in the class. </p> <p>We will introduce enforceable home-school contracts that spell out both parents' and pupils' responsibilities. And we will give heads complete control over expulsion. If they decide to expel a disruptive pupil, they will not be second-guessed by an outside panel. </p> <p>Next, the police. As with every other public service, Labour has inundated the police with Whitehall targets, inspectorates and directives. Of course, the move towards centralisation did not start in May 1997. It has been happening gradually for decades. But top-down control has ballooned under this government. </p> <p>Under Labour, the National Policing Plan sets out five strategic priorities for the police. The Police Performance and Assessment Framework has 13 headline measures and 36 component measures. The police are overseen by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Audit Commission and a new Police Standards Unit. </p> <p>As Robert Peel, the founder of Britain's police force, said: \"The test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder - not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with it\".</p> <p>But David Blunkett's Policing Performance Assessment Framework requires the police to: \"measure the victims' ... of domestic burglary or violent crime ... satisfaction with the overall level of service provided\". But what the victims of burglary and violent crime want is to see the criminal who caused the crime caught, convicted and punished.</p> <p>David Blunkett's bureaucratic framework also sets out to measure the percentage of local people who think their police \"do a good job\". But people know if their police are doing a good job by the level of crime and disorder in their neighbourhood. </p> <p>It is not PR that people want, it is effective policing. </p> <p>Conservatives will give the police a simple, clear objective: \".... to prevent crime and disorder\". </p> <p>We need to police our streets - not de-police them. We need a police force which intervenes, confronts and challenges every kind of crime and disorder - from graffiti and litter to burglary and robbery. In short we need zero tolerance policing. </p> <p>As Ray has shown in Middlesbrough, and Rudi Guiliani showed in New York, by challenging disorder you begin to claim ground back from the yobs and hoodlums controlling our cities. You demonstrate that there is a line people cannot cross - and as police confidence rises in challenging unacceptable behaviour, so public confidence rises in the police. By challenging so-called small crimes head-on, you push back the burglars, car thieves and drug dealers responsible for so much of the crime in Britain today. </p> <p>Conservatives will cut away at the police paperwork that keeps policemen and women chained to their desks. And here's an example of what we don't do.</p> <p>The Macpherson report recommended that the police keep a record of every stop they make - and that anyone stopped by the police should be able to see a record of that paperwork. On average, it will take about seven minutes to fill in the paperwork for each individual stop.</p> <p>If a police officer saw a troublemaker on the high street, is he or she more likely to stop him if it means having to spend seven minutes filling in the paperwork back at the station? And imagine if it wasn't just one - but half a dozen? That's not just seven minutes - it's the best part of one hour. Would that police officer still stop those troublemakers? </p> <p>The government is about to launch further trials to implement this recommendation. Conservatives would not implement this recommendation.</p> <p>And Conservatives will support the police when it comes to stop and search. Increased stop and search is part of the solution to rising crime.</p> <p>Effective policing depends on stop and search. In response to the 9/11 disaster David Blunkett rightly gave the police new stop and search powers to deal with terrorism. At the time he described them as \"reasonable and proportionate\".</p> <p>Not surprisingly the police used those new powers. But no sooner had they done so than the government instigated an inquiry into their use. Politicians in Whitehall need to stop second guessing the police at every turn. </p> <p>And Conservatives will put more police back on our streets. We will massively increase police numbers across the country. The lesson of Guiliani's success in New Yorkis that you need to increase police numbers. </p> <p><b>Licensing Laws</b></p> <p>Everyone knows that a great deal of criminal behaviour is fuelled by alcohol. I am all in favour of people having a good time - and the creation of a caf\u00e9 culture is part of the process of regeneration in our towns and cities. But in many places what we're seeing isn't a caf\u00e9 culture - it's a yob culture. </p> <p>The government claims to have handed control over licensing to local councils. But as always with Labour, it's not real local control. For example, central government guidelines make it virtually impossible for local councils to turn down applications if they think there are already too many bars or clubs in an area. But local people must be able to say through their elected representatives \"enough is enough\" if they want to. Conservatives will give local councils real control over licensing in their area.</p> <p><b>Punishing Offenders</b></p> <p>When it comes to punishing offenders, we need to send a clear, unequivocal message to criminals - if you break the law you will be punished. </p> <p>Cautions should be for first time offenders - community penalties for less serious crimes. But persistent, violent and dangerous criminals should be sent to prison. The public needs protection from them. </p> <p>A hard core of criminals commit most of the crime in Britain today. If they are behind bars they cannot commit more crime.</p> <p><b>Prison</b></p> <p>Under Labour, prison building has not kept up with the rise in the prison population. As a consequence our prisons are over crowded. Prisoners are now being released early to cope with the problem - and the courts are increasingly unable to sentence persistent offenders to prison.</p> <p>As if this wasn't bad enough, Labour have set an arbitrary limit on the prison population in the UK. Ministers have said it must not rise above 80,000. This is an extremely dangerous approach - which will only store up problems for the future.</p> <p>Yes prison building costs money - but it is the first duty of government to protect the public. The best way to do that is to put serious, persistent and dangerous criminals behind bars. And it sends a powerful to message to those outside prison - crime doesn't pay.</p> <p>The cost to society of failing to take action is far greater than the cost of prison building itself.</p> <p>Conservatives will also end the government's dangerous early release scheme. </p> <p>It's not a question of if we build new prisons - it is a question of how many new prisons we build and what kind of prisons they are.</p> <p>And zero tolerance should apply just as much inside prison as on our streets. We will drug test all prisoners on arrival - and test them regularly throughout their sentence. </p> <p> Recent reports from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons suggest that drug testing in prisons is not being effectively implemented. And how many people know that when prisoners commit crimes against other inmates, they are rarely prosecuted. Why? If prisoners commit crimes they should be prosecuted. Failure to do so brings the law into disrepute.</p> <p>Finally, drugs. Despite increasing drug abuse, there are only 2,000 rehab places in the entire country. That's right just 2,000. All the evidence shows that people with a drug habit are more likely to kick it if they receive intensive treatment in a secure, residential clinic. So we will increase the number of rehab places to 20,000 - enough for every hard drug addict aged 16 to 24. </p> <p>Addicts will then face a choice - rehab or prison. And if you drop out of rehab you go straight to prison. There will be no second chances. If we are to get young addicts off the conveyor belt to crime we will need to be firm but fair.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>On November 201996 Ray Mallon was appointed Head of Crime Strategy for the Middlesbrough Division of Cleveland Police. That same day he pledged to cut crime by 20% within eighteen months or else resign. Ray exceeded his target within six months.</p> <p>Crime is still falling in Middlesbrough today.</p> <p>But across Britain crime is rising. People today fear crime. They know that the criminal justice system is moving in the wrong direction and that as a society we are under attack from values which put rights before responsibility. </p> <p>We need to make clear the difference between right and wrong. We need an end to the excuses for poor behaviour and crime. We need to stand up for the resolute, silent majority.</p> <p>Our society needs more discipline, decent values and respect. Respect for people, respect for property and respect for the neighbourhood. Today crime is at record levels, and under Labour, it will only get worse. </p> <p>By cutting police paperwork and political correctness, and putting more police on the beat, we can and we will make our streets safer. </p> <p>Why should people believe me any more than any other politician when I say this? Because I have some experience when it comes to cutting crime. </p> <p>Last month Tony Blair boasted that it was time to end the 1960s consensus on law and order. But the truth is I ended that consensus when I became home secretary in 1993. </p> <p>My approach was simple: to give the police the powers they needed to catch criminals; to give the courts the powers they needed to convict criminals; and to give our prisons the space to take persistent, serious and dangerous offenders out of circulation altogether. </p> <p>That approach worked. By 1997 when I left the Home Office, almost one million fewer crimes were being committed each year. I am proud of my record in cutting crime.</p> <p>I did not accept then and I do not accept now that rising crime is an inevitable fact of modern life. With decisive action and clear leadership, we can cut crime.</p> <p>But although I have a track record, I know that, to the silent, resolute and decent people who may read or hear these words, that will not be enough. Talk is cheap. </p> <p>People have had enough of personal crusades that last as long as a news bulletin. They want to know that, for a change, a politician means what he says, and will be prepared to take the rap if he fails.</p> <p>My fight against crime will not last for a news bulletin. It will last for five years.</p> <p>After five years, I will be happy to be judged on my record.</p> <p>As I showed when I was home secretary - and Ray Mallon has shown in Middlesbrough and Hartlepool- if you are resolute, if you are determined, if you have the will, you can cut crime.</p> <p>We are resolute, we are determined, we have the will. We will cut crime.</p>",
  "<p>The government today announced a campaign against the booming trade in counterfeit goods such as DVDs and perfumes, which deprives the UK economy of billions of pounds.</p> <p>Britain's first intellectual property crime strategy - which encompasses brand owners, police, trading standards and customs - involves sharing information and improving inter-agency coordination, improving the training of frontline staff, and an annual national enforcement report. </p> <p>\"Intellectual property crime is not victimless,\" Jacqui Smith, the industry minister, said. \"As well as cheating consumers, the trade in counterfeit goods costs UK companies billions of pounds and thousands of jobs every year. </p> <p>\"That is why we are working together with industry and law enforcement agencies to clamp down on this illegal trade.\"</p> <p>The new initiative comes amid an explosion in counterfeiting and piracy which is believed to have cost the British economy \u00a310bn and 4,000 jobs last year, according to Ruth Orchard, the director of the anti-counterfeiting group.</p> <p>All the major anti-piracy trade bodies are reporting a huge rise in the level of fake products being smuggled into the UK. The federation against copyright theft seized almost 1.8 million pirated DVDs last year - a rise of 405% cent on the previous year and one that deprived the film industry of \u00a3440m in lost revenue. </p> <p>Anecdotal evidence suggests blockbuster movies were available illegally long before their release date. The hit British film Love Actually was released last Christmas, but was sold illegally several months before. Anti-piracy organisations also believe that a boom in the number of websites and internet user groups devoted to selling illegal copies of CDs and movies indicates a growing problem. </p> <p>The British Phonographic Industry, which represents the major record labels, says commercial piracy is on the increase. </p> <p>Music piracy generated more than \u00a356m for counterfeiters each year, the BPI said, with the figure growing by 13% in 2003 - six times the rise in legitimate CD sales. However, even these estimates, which are based on seizures of counterfeit media, are thought to underplay the true extent of the problem. </p> <p>\"Counterfeiting is a massive problems for the recorded music industry,\" David Martin, the BPI anti-piracy director, said. \"A huge amount of investment goes into developing new acts, and piracy makes that investment that much harder. It's not the established acts that suffer the most at the hands of music pirates - it's the unsigned artists that rely on that investment.\" </p> <p>Fake branded products such as perfume and clothes still make up the lion's share of the counterfeit market. Trading standards officers, however, believe that a steep rise in the amount of pirated media smuggled into the country from Russia and Asia is becoming the fastest-growing area.</p> <p>\"Counterfeiting is a global business run by highly-organised serious criminals using it as a low-risk way of laundering money and raising funds for other criminal activities,\" Bryan Lewin, of the Trading Standards Institute, said. </p> <p>\"To tackle crime at this level, trading standards, the industry, and other enforcement agencies must adopt an equally organised and co-ordinated approach. The national intellectual property crime strategy will help to achieve this objective.\"</p>",
  "While most natural disasters have only a local impact, some rare events can have knock-on effects that reach out for thousands of miles. Referred to by scientists as gee-gees, \"global geophysical events\" are so severe their impact can be felt the world over. <p>Climate change is a more familiar gee-gees, but mega-tsunami, strikes by asteroids or comets, and so-called super-eruptions from volcanoes are also being studied. </p> <p><b>Mega-tsunami</b> are caused by asteroids or comets crashing into the sea, or collapsing islands such as La Palma in the Canary islands. The chances of experiencing a mega-tsunami, with enormous waves charging around the globe, are calculated to be in the order of 0.7%. </p> <p><b>Super eruptions</b> are also rare. According to Bill McGuire the chance of experiencing a super eruption in your lifetime is less than 0.14%. The last one happened 73,500 years ago in Toba in Sumatra, with a force at least 1,000 times that of the Mount St Helens eruption in 1980. </p> <p>Super eruptions produce enormous amounts of ash. Around 1,000 cubic kilometres can be thrown into the atmosphere 120 times faster than water plunges over the Victoria Falls. </p> <p>The ash ejected from a super eruption immediately blackens the sky, preventing light from the sun reaching the planet. The consequences are a \"volcanic winter\" - stretches of bad weather lasting more than five years, potentially triggering a collapse in agriculture. </p> <p><b>Comet and asteroid strikes</b>, such as those thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs, have been the subject of intense research in the past decade. In 1994 the comet Shoemaker-Levy collided with Jupiter, the first time humans have been able to witness a giant impact on another planet. \"A similar impact [on Earth] would have completely devastated our civilisation,\" said Benny Peiser at Liverpool's John Moores University. </p> <p>After this the US initiated a search to identify 90% of large \"near Earth objects\" within 10 years. By 1995 scientists had detected around 300. Now they know of 3,000. By spotting the heavenly bodies and calculating their trajectories, scientists can work out which may be on a collision course with Earth. </p> <p>Thanks to better telescopes, the threat of a catastrophic collision with a comet or asteroid is one gee-gee that is becoming less of a threat. \"It is likely that within the next one or two generations, we'll actually be able to close the window of vulnerability and get on top of this problem,\" said Dr Peiser.</p>",

  "<p>Inflation stayed firmly under wraps in July despite strong economic growth, official figures showed today.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% on the month, taking the annual rate down to 1.4% from 1.6% and below consensus forecasts for 1.5%.</p> <p>July's figures leave inflation well below the Bank of England's 2% target, although policymakers last week already predicted a slowdown in the near-term when they raised the base interest rate to 4.75% - the fifth increase since November.</p> <p>Despite the slowdown in consumer prices, analysts said an interest rate rise was likely in the next few months because of the Bank's worries about inflationary pressures stemming from strong growth.</p> <p>The Bank \"is more concerned about the increased underlying inflationary pressures stemming from above-trend growth and a small and rapidly disappearing output gap, as well as rising earnings amid a tight labour market\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>\"Furthermore, oil prices have moved back up recently.

  "<p>Tony Blair has laid out a five-year plan for schools that will mean the \"best schools\" will be able to abandon the shackles of local-authority control, and pay teachers according to the market. The Conservative party has similar proposals to allow all schools freedom from LEAs. Both parties are promising parents the chance to choose the best school for their child.</p> <p>There seems to be little to separate the two parties, apart from the issue of selection. Blair is against it; Michael Howard, the Tory leader, wants to give secondary schools the power to choose their own pupils.</p> <p>I believe the Labour party has dug itself into a big hole in this regard over the past 30 years. During the 1960s it introduced the comprehensive system. In most boroughs grammar schools were abolished. Yet, three decades on, it is unnerving to see that most of the cabinet are either public-school educated or from grammar schools.</p> <p>Isn't it disturbing to see that very few comprehensive pupils, especially ones from working-class backgrounds, have made their mark on society? Look at the upper echelons of the BBC, or the media, or the legal system, and you will see that they are dominated by people from public schools and grammars. It is even more worrying to see two public school boys - Tony Blair and Charles Clarke - dictating education policies. And it is positively alarming to note that the prime minister himself sends his children to a school that is in effect selective.</p> <p>\"Faith-based\" schools such as the London Oratory can select pupils on the basis of their religious orientation. In practice, this means that headteachers can interview children and glean much information about their academic abilities as well as their commitment to a faith. \"Faithbased\" school is code for \"selective\" school, for those in the know.</p> <p>Blair is telling parents to send their children to the local non-selective comprehensive, yet he and his family are benefiting from the opposite system. I am a parent who lives in London. I also work at a state-funded secondary school, which is losing its ability to select pupils because of Labour party policies. The school interviews pupils and judges them on seven criteria, including extracurricular interests and belief in a Christian ethos.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the headteacher is looking for pupils who are bright and articulate - whatever their background. Because the school is nearly 500 years old, and was based in Mile End Road until the 1970s, it has seen its remit as being to educate children from many areas in the east end. It is now based in the leafy suburb of Upminster, but serves a very wide catchment area.</p> <p>Teaching at the school has made me aware how important it is for highly intelligent children to learn in a friendly, intellectual environment.</p> <p>Unfortunately, my experience has been that clever children can often - but not always - become disaffected in classrooms where there are a lot of kids who are struggling with the curriculum. There's no one to compete with. In such contexts, it's much easier for clever kids to switch off and think up intelligent scams for winding up the teacher. In non-selective schools I have taught in I have seen quite a few very bright pupils - boys in particular - give up entirely.</p> <p>In my school, where results are among the best in the country, boys achieve at more or less the same level as the girls, because the competitive atmosphere to succeed spurs them on. Such levels of achievement among boys are unheard of in most comprehensives. Seeing this has made me think that perhaps cities like London could benefit from schools that select according to ability. The trouble is, many cities like London are tremendously polarised. Adhering to a non-selective system has created ghettoisation in urban schools. Many are dominated by one social or ethnic group. Giving schools the power to select pupils is a good way round this: it means a mix of pupils from different backgrounds can be achieved. </p> <p>Ironically, it is the non-selective system, whose champions pride themselves on being so inclusive, that is the most divisive. </p> <p>Why should the prime minister be one of the very few people who has the opportunity to send his children to a state-funded school that is selective in all but name?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Francis Gilbert's I'm A Teacher, Get Me Out Of Here is published by Short Books</p>",
  "<p>The price of crude on futures markets rose to record levels in both London and New York last night after the threat of sabotage by rebels forced Iraq to shut down production in its southern oilfields. </p> <p>Fears of prolonged disruption to supply led to a fresh wave of speculative buying in markets already rattled by the prospect of dearer energy, prompting a slowdown in the global economy. </p> <p>After falling back early in the day, prices surged as threats from the militia of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr prompted emergency action from the Iraqi authorities to protect oil installations and pipelines. </p> <p>\"Pumping from the southern oilfields to storage tanks at Basra was stopped today after threats made by al-Sadr,\" an official said. \"It will remain stopped until the threat is over.\" </p> <p>Guards were yesterday patrolling the length of two pipelines which link Iraq's southern fields with two terminals in the Persian Gulf from which the crude is exported. Reports said, however, that militiamen loyal to al-Sadr were controlling key road junctions in Basra, Iraq's second city and the heart of its oil industry. </p> <p>Airlines have already started increasing surcharges on passengers to offset the rising cost of aviation fuel and motorists were last night bracing themselves for a further increase in petrol prices. </p> <p>Brent futures rose more than $1 a barrel to $41.65 by the close in the City and US light crude traded within a whisker of the key support level of $45 a barrel in early dealing. </p> <p>The Iraqi official said militiamen from al-Sadr's Mehdi Army had threatened to sabotage production by the state-owned Southern Oil Company, based in Basra. </p> <p>He said storage at the Basra terminal was sufficient to keep exports running for about two days. </p> <p>Despite attempts to calm the markets, news that Iraqi armed militiamen were freely roaming the main southern oil production centre and that insurgents had fired mortar rounds at the oil ministry compound in Baghdad prompted speculation that the cost of US crude would soon be testing the $50-a-barrel level. </p> <p>Iraq has been exporting about 1.9m barrels a day, but a week of violence in the country has rekindled concern about the ability of oil supplies to keep up with strong global demand. With the threat of bankruptcy still hanging over the Russian oil company Yukos, analysts were gloomy about the outlook. </p> <p>\"It looks like the insurgency might threaten oil supply, and that's enough to get this speculative momentum going again,\" said Marshall Steeves, analyst at Refco Group. </p> <p>Prices have rallied more than 30% this year as demand growth, especially in the United States and China, has left little leeway for any supply disruptions. Consumption is accelerating at its fastest pace in more than 20 years. </p> <p>The oil cartel Opec, which controls about half of the world's crude export supply, has said it is pumping at the highest levels since 1979. Its president, Purnomo Yusgiantoro, said last week the group was ready to lift production by 1m to 1.5m barrels a day if deemed necessary when ministers meet next month.</p>",

  "It has everything you could wish for in a cliche-ridden disaster movie. A beautiful volcanic island in the Atlantic is on the brink of catastrophic collapse, threatening to unleash giant waves that will wreak havoc around the globe within hours. And while scientists try in vain to make their concerns heard, the world's governments look the other way. <p>But yesterday a leading expert claimed the doom-laden scenario was not only real but was being almost completely ignored by people in power. </p> <p>Bill McGuire, the director of the Benfield Grieg Hazard Research Centre at University College London, said a huge chunk of rock, roughly the size of the Isle of Man, was on the brink of breaking off the volcanic island of La Palma in the Canaries. </p> <p>When - Professor McGuire says it is not a matter of if - the rock plunges into the ocean it will trigger giant waves called mega-tsunamis. </p> <p>Travelling at speeds of up to 560mph, the huge walls of water will tear across the ocean and hit islands and continents, leaving a trail of destruction. </p> <p>Mega-tsunami waves are much longer than the ones we are used to. </p> <p>\"When one of these comes in, it keeps on coming for 10 to 15 minutes,\" Prof McGuire said. </p> <p>\"It's like a huge wall of water that just keeps coming.\" </p> <p>Computer models of the island's collapse show the first regions to be hit, with waves topping 100 metres (330ft), will be the neighbouring Canary Islands. Within a few hours the west coast of Africa will be battered with similar-sized waves. </p> <p>Between nine and 12 hours after the island collapses, waves between 20 and 50 metres high will have crossed 4,000 miles of ocean to crash into the Caribbean islands and the eastern seaboard of the US and Canada. </p> <p>The worst-hit will be harbours and estuaries, which will channel the waves inland. The loss of life and destruction to property will probably be immense, according to Prof McGuire. </p> <p>Britain would not escape entirely, he added. Waves of around 10 metres are likely to strike the south coast four to five hours after the island collapses, causing damage to seaside resorts and ports. </p> <p>Such devastating natural disasters are rare, occurring on average every 10,000 years. But La Palma could collapse much sooner than that. \"The thing about La Palma is we know it's on the move now,\" Prof McGuire said. </p> <p>The island came to the attention of scientists in 1949 when its volcano, Cumbre Vieja, erupted, causing a huge chunk of its western flank to drop four metres into the ocean. Scientists believe the chunk of land is still slipping slowly into the water, and say another eruption is likely to make the entire western flank collapse. \"When it goes, it will likely collapse in around 90 seconds,\" Prof McGuire said. </p> <p><b>Precarious</b><br> </p> <p>Despite the potential scale of the threat, little is being done to monitor the geological activity of La Palma. Only a few seismometers have been set up on the precarious western flank of the island, which do not provide enough information to predict when another eruption might occur. </p> <p>\"It's really a worrying situation,\" Prof McGuire said. \"It will almost certainly go during an eruption. The problem is that with just a few seismometers on the island, we may not get the notice we need.\" </p> <p>The scientist called for an international effort to install more sophisticated sensors on the island, as well as global positioning satellite units to detect how quickly the land mass was falling into the ocean. \"We need to have better monitoring so we know when an eruption is about to happen,\" he said. Such a system could cost as little as a few hundred thousand dollars. </p> <p>\"The US government must be aware of the La Palma threat. They should certainly be worried, and so should the island states in the Caribbean that will really bear the brunt of a collapse. </p> <p>\"They're not taking it seriously. Governments change every four to five years and generally they're not interested in these things.\" </p> <p>Even with new monitoring equipment in place, La Palma presents a difficult problem for those charged with mitigating against natural disasters. </p> <p>Little can be done to protect against the waves produced when La Palma collapses. Barriers would not be able to sustain the battering, and breaking the island apart before it collapses is either too dangerous or time-consuming. </p> <p>New sensors could warn of an impending eruption two weeks in advance. But no one knows whether the island will collapse during the next eruption, or in an eruption that will not happen for centuries. </p> <p>Ordering mass evacuations would have a huge financial impact that could cause resentment if it turned out to be a false alarm. The disaster could affect up to 100 million people from the coast of Africa to the Canary islands and the east coast of North America. </p> <p>\"The future president of the US has got to make a call at some point, that when La Palma erupts, what is he going to do?\" Prof McGuire said. </p> <p>\"Is he going to evacuate all the major cities on the east coast? If he gets it wrong, nobody's ever going to pay attention again and he'll be out of a job.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"We live,\" the cover story of the current Spectator tells us, \"in the happiest, healthiest and most peaceful era in human history.\" And who in the rich world would dare to deny it? The aristocrats, the cardinals, Prince Charles, the National Front, perhaps: those, in other words, whose former social dominance has been usurped by the times. But the rest of us? Step forward the man or woman who would exchange modern medicine for the leech, sewerage for the gutter, the washing machine for the mangle, European Union for European wars, relative democracy for absolute monarchy. Not many takers, then. </p> <p>But the party is over. In 2,000 words, the Spectator provides plenty of evidence to support its first contention: \"Now is good.\" It provides none to support its second: \"The future will be better.\" Ours are the most fortunate generations that have ever lived. They are also the most fortunate generations that ever will. </p> <p>Let me lay before you three lines of evidence. The first is that we are living off the political capital accumulated by previous generations, and that this capital is almost spent. The massive redistribution which raised the living standards of the working class after the New Deal and the second world war is over. Inequality is rising almost everywhere, and the result is a global resource grab by the rich. The entire land mass of Britain, Europe and the United States is being re-engineered to accommodate the upper middle classes. They are buying second and third homes where others have none. Playing fields are being replaced with health clubs, public transport budgets with subsidies for roads and airports. Inequality of outcome, in other words, leads inexorably to inequality of opportunity. </p> <p>The second line of evidence is that our economic gains are being offset by social losses. A recent study by the New Economics Foundation suggests that the costs of crime have risen by 13 times in the past 50 years, and the costs of family breakdown fourfold. The money we spend on such disasters is included in the official measure of human happiness: gross domestic product. Extract these costs and you discover, the study says, that our quality of life peaked in 1976. </p> <p>But neither of these problems compares to the third one: the threat of climate change. In common with all those generations which have contemplated catastrophe, we appear to be incapable of understanding what confronts us. </p> <p>Three wholly unexpected sets of findings now suggest that the problem could be much graver than anyone had imagined. Work by the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen suggests that the screening effect produced by particles of soot and smoke in the atmosphere is stronger than climatologists thought; one variety of man-made filth, in other words, has been protecting us from the effects of another. As ancient smokestacks are closed down or replaced with cleaner technology, climate change, paradoxically, will intensify. </p> <p>At the same time, rising levels of carbon dioxide appear to be breaking down the world's peat bogs. Research by Chris Freeman at the University of Bangor shows that the gas stimulates bacteria which dissolve the peat. Peat bogs are more or less solid carbon. When they go into solution the carbon turns into carbon dioxide, which in turn dissolves more peat. The bogs of Europe, Siberia and North America, New Scientist reports, contain the equivalent of 70 years of global industrial carbon emissions. </p> <p>Worse still are the possible effects of changes in cloud cover. Until recently, climatologists assumed that, because higher temperatures would raise the rate of evaporation, more clouds would form. By blocking some of the heat from the sun, they would reduce the rate of global warming. But now it seems that higher temperatures may instead burn off the clouds. Research by Bruce Wielicki of Nasa suggests that some parts of the tropics are already less cloudy than they were in the 1980s. </p> <p>The result of all this is that the maximum temperature rise proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2001 may be a grave underestimate. Rather than a possible 5.8 degrees of warming this century, we could be looking at a maximum of 10 or 12. Goodbye, kind world. </p> <p>Like every impending disaster (think of the rise of Hitler or the fall of Rome), this one has generated a voluble industry of denial. Few people are now foolish enough to claim that man-made climate change isn't happening at all, but the few are still granted plenty of scope to make idiots of themselves in public. Last month they were joined by the former environmentalist David Bellamy. </p> <p> Writing in the Daily Mail, Bellamy asserted that \"the link between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming is a myth\". Like almost all the climate change deniers, he based his claim on a petition produced in 1998 by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine and \"signed by over 18,000 scientists\". Had Bellamy studied the signatories, he would have discovered that the \"scientists\" included Ginger Spice and the cast of MASH. The Oregon Institute is run by a fundamentalist Christian called Arthur Robinson. Its petition was attached to what purported to be a scientific paper, printed in the font and format of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In fact, the paper had not been peer-reviewed or published in any scientific journal. Anyone could sign the petition, and anyone did: only a handful of the signatories are experts in climatology, and quite a few of them appear to have believed that they were signing a genuine paper. And yet, six years later, this petition is still being wheeled out to suggest that climatologists say global warming isn't happening. </p> <p>But most of those who urge inaction have given up denying the science, and now seek instead to suggest that climate change is taking place, but it's no big deal. Their champion is the Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg. Writing in the Times in May, Lomborg claimed to have calculated that global warming will cause $5 trillion of damage, and would cost $4 trillion to ameliorate. The money, he insisted, would be better spent elsewhere. </p> <p>The idea that we can attach a single, meaningful figure to the costs incurred by global warming is laughable. Climate change is a non-linear process, whose likely impacts cannot be totted up like the expenses for a works outing to the seaside. Even those outcomes we can predict are impossible to cost. We now know, for example, that the Himalayan glaciers which feed the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong, the Yangtze and the other great Asian rivers are likely to disappear within 40 years. If these rivers dry up during the irrigation season, then the rice production which currently feeds over one third of humanity collapses, and the world goes into net food deficit. If Lomborg believes he can put a price on that, he has plainly spent too much of his life with his calculator and not enough with human beings. But people listen to this nonsense because the alternative is to accept what no one wants to believe. </p> <p>We live in the happiest, healthiest and most peaceful era in human history. And it will not last long.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The end of the second world war, and the building of the New Jerusalem: in the histories, the two morph seamlessly into one another. Hindsight records the elision as seemingly inevitable. But for those living through the period, that was never quite the way it felt. History was altogether more personal. War was more about doing one's duty, looking out for one's fellow soldiers, sailors and airmen - not to mention friends and family - and hoping one would come through unscathed, rather than about some grander moral purpose.</p> <p>When the servicemen and women were demobilised, it was their own fractured lives and relationships they were primarily concerned with rebuilding. It was a time of hope and uncertainty: hope that after six years of fighting, their lives could be rebuilt; uncertainty that they had the wherewithal to do it.</p> <p>How do you start again? This was a question that both government and individuals had to answer. What you need in time of war is not what you need in time of peace. With this in mind, the government introduced the Further Education and Training Scheme to allow war veterans easy access to university; entrance requirements were waived, grants were offered and two-year degrees established.</p> <p>Not everyone wanted a place at university: some felt their moment had passed, that they had experienced too much. And not all those who wanted a place could get one, as six years of entry had to be shoehorned into one or two.</p> <p>But for those who did, the experience was often life-changing. Many went back to study something completely different to what they might have done had war not broken out. Virtually all took their courses more seriously. This was the moment to make up for lost time. It was also the moment when many of the old hierarchical structures between academics and students began to break down. The ex-servicemen were that much older, that much more experienced than previous generations of students and were not going to be bound by petty restrictions. Unlike many of the academics, who could only read about history, this generation had helped to write it.</p> <p>The ex-servicemen interviewed on these pages are unwilling to make many claims for their achievements. Their stories have been lost in the wider social histories of the time, and their pathfinding for the students of the 50s and 60s has largely gone unheralded. But it is not too much to say that this generation changed the nature of the modern university.</p> <p><strong>Alastair Mundy-Castle, 81, taught at Harvard and was professor of psychology at Lagos University. He lives in South Africa</strong></p> <p>I was at school in Tonbridge when the war broke out. I tried to join the RAF as a 16-year-old in 1939, but was too young. I remember the excitement as I watched the Battle of Britain being fought in the skies over Kent and in 1940 I applied to the RAF again and was accepted for initial training.</p> <p>It was a strange period. I was first sent to Iceland, then Canada, before ending up in Georgia in the US. It took a while to get posted back to Britain, and then I was sent to South Africa to become a flying instructor for the Empire Training Scheme. Death was accepted as part of the deal, even at training school. When someone died, everyone got drunk and played games of hurling ourselves on top of one another. When we sobered up, it was back to normal.</p> <p>At the end of my stay in South Africa I got married, and my wife and I returned to Britain in January 1948. My time in the RAF had brought me into contact with many different types of people, and I was keen to study psychology. I didn't have a career in mind, just a tremendous thirst for knowledge. If the war hadn't come along, I'm not sure I'd have bothered with university as an 18-year-old: I was rather wild then and I had visions of going to India to become a pearl diver.</p> <p>I was a rather serious student when I went up to Cambridge in October 1948. Partly, this was because I had to live out of Magdalene College as a married man, and partly because I was very conscious of making up for lost time. Most of my friends were ex-servicemen and we all felt like that. I only went out on a Friday or Saturday, and college dinners were much grander than anything I had come across before.</p> <p>We did have fun, though. Cambridge was a beautiful place and so relaxing after everything I had been through. I played rugby and squash and loved sitting by the river, chatting to Michael Blair, one of Wittgenstein's philosophy students. We would discuss Freud, Adler and art in the earnest way that students do. I enjoyed every minute - so much so I went on to make a career out of it.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Lever, 83, from Bolton, retired after a career as a land agent. He lives in Malvern</strong></p> <p>I was accepted for Christ's Cambridge as a result of the matriculation exams I sat when I was 16, and went up in 1938 to read science. It was an odd choice as I was intending to become a priest.</p> <p>I didn't work at all hard and no one pushed me to do so. Most of my first year was spent hanging around with a scholar from Caius who was much wealthier than me, going on the river in the morning, eating strawberry mash and watching trains in the afternoon.</p> <p>My tutor, the novelist CP Snow, rather liked me and gave me a special at the end of the first year, which meant I could stay up to do an ordinary degree, but I rather think I would have failed that, had I stayed on. I still have many of the textbooks from that time on my bookshelves. And they're still unread.</p> <p>We all knew there was a war coming in 1939, but I tried not to let that interfere with my life too much, and spent the summer of that year playing tennis and restoring my mother's cottage.</p> <p>But you couldn't totally ignore the war. I had joined the Territorial Army in 1938 and in July 1939 I was sent on a short course for junior officers at Sandhurst. I was mobilised on the day before war was declared.</p> <p>It seems strange to admit it, but the early days of the war were rather fun. I was in the 5th Royals, which was initially an infantry regiment but soon switched to motorbikes, which I enjoyed immensely. I only stopped riding my old Triumph when I was in my late 70s.</p> <p>I became frustrated at my lack of promotion and applied to join the RAF. I was assigned to the Observer Corps. This, too, was fun while we were flying Sunderlands, but when the squadron was switched to Blenheims I became terribly airsick. I was sent to become an instructor.</p> <p>This was fine for a while, but I soon felt worthless. It seemed as if I was teaching aircrews things they already knew. I couldn't handle the lack of responsibility and had a breakdown, and was sent to the brand new psychiatric unit at Guy's Hospital in London.</p> <p>I was invalided out of the war in 1944 and went back to Cambridge later that year to read agriculture and estate management. The only condition imposed on me by Christ's was that I couldn't have a room in college, as I was told they didn't want to run the risk of the embarrassment of a suicide in the building.</p> <p>The five-year gap had left a marked change of attitude. During the war, I had learnt to work and I basically got my head down. I did play some bridge in the evenings, but as all my partners were eventually sent down, even that pleasure went by the wayside. The other change in me was that before the war I had been very High Church: by the end I had lost my taste for it entirely. I'm not sure why exactly.</p> <p>In 1944 most of the undergraduates were crocks, such as myself, who had been invalided out of the services and we tended to stick together. There were a few younger cadets, on six-month secondments before joining up, but they were there for such a short time I never really got to know them.</p> <p>The ethos of the university had also changed. We were all looking forward to the future, towards building our careers. We didn't want to look back. On VE day I had my head buried in books revising for exams and on VJ day I was inspecting potato crops.</p> <p><strong>Laurence Harbottle, 80, is still a partner in his London law firm</strong></p> <p>I was at school at the Leys in Cambridge, and we were evacuated to Pitlochry in 1940 when Addenbrookes Hospital took over the school. I enlisted with the Royal Regiment of Artillery in Scotland on an army con trick: they took me under age and sent me to Durham University for six months. I learnt about fuels and explosives by day and did some army training in the evening.</p> <p>The regiment then sent me to an officer training unit and I spent two years on active service at various camps around England as a 2nd lieutenant. In early 1944 the regiment was split up and the officers were sent to organise the embarkation contingent for D-day at Felixstowe. Afterwards we were posted to India and were on the point of chasing the Japanese out of Malaysia when the war ended. We then did some peace-keeping on the north-west frontier in the run-up to independence, before being sent home and demobilised in 1947.</p> <p>I never had a career plan, either before or after the war. I flirted with the idea of becoming an actor, but I settled for studying law. I thought I should do something useful: I had taken five years out of my life doing what other people wanted me to do, and I felt the need to make up for the time I had lost.</p> <p>Being accepted at Emmanuel in 1948 was surprisingly easy - just a couple of letters and an informal interview. I think the master of the college had good connections with my former English teacher. Cambridge itself was a novelty. The 1950s are often thought of as a time of austerity and deprivation, but it didn't feel that way to me. Maybe I just wasn't much of a sybarite: I still remember the stir that Kenneth Tynan caused when he came to visit from Oxford in his purple suit.</p> <p>There were schisms. Some of the older lecturers seemed to be slightly at a loss for not having been part of the war and felt inferior to the returning warriors, while many of the younger lecturers had fought alongside the student ex-servicemen and this created a mutual respect and bond between us.</p> <p>My time in the army had made me very adaptable, and I just got on with life. I was living in digs, and wore my demob suit to lectures almost every day. I'm not sure that everyone knuckled down in the way I did: the younger students seemed to have much more fun, but I was just busy getting a degree.</p> <p>It was all rather tame in some ways. I'd learnt to obey the rules so that's what I did. We all had to be in at certain times - the college doors were closed at 10pm - and I was never locked out. We were all very controlled and conformist at heart, I suspect. The real revolutionaries were the students who came after us.</p> <p><strong>Bob Brow (main picture), 80, is the former head of a mission group in Canada. He lives in Ontario</strong></p> <p>At the start of the war I was at Stowe, and during the Battle of Britain my parents called me out to join them in India. It was a long and dangerous journey and one or two of the escort ships were sunk, though I was more concerned about my girlfriend on board than the threat of torpedoes. I was 16 when I arrived in Karachi, and I spent the next two years at Aitchison College, Lahore. I was supposed to be completing my education, but the most important lesson seemed to be learning how to ride a polo pony.</p> <p>I was called up into the Yorks and Lancs regiment seven days after my 18th birthday, and was sent for officer training at Bangalore as the Indian army urgently needed officers in Burma. It was a job with a high death rate as the officers were picked off by the Japanese, and several of my friends were killed. More by luck than anything else, I was selected as a small arms instructor for the Mahratta Light Infantry. My last posting was as adjutant of my battalion in Java.</p> <p>As we came back to India early in 1947 I wondered what I would do when I was demobilised. To my astonishment I heard that the government would pay all my expenses to study at the university of my choice. I thought of a business career and was accepted at the London School of Economics. But when I wrote to my school principal, JF Roxburgh, at Stowe, he answered: \"My Dear Robert, I put you down for Trinity College, Cambridge on the basis of your school certificate, and if you write to Mr Sandbach, you will find you have a place there.\"</p> <p>Early in October 1947 I went into digs on Jesus Lane, and found myself eating in the Great Hall at Trinity. Bertrand Russell used to sit at the high table, except when he knew he would be the senior don and required to say the three-minute grace in Latin. But otherwise it was hardly different from eating in the regimental mess.</p> <p>We all got on well - both the ex-servicemen and the undergraduates straight from school - and Cambridge was certainly a happy place to be. We were all quite serious, though, and one of my tutors did comment that he had never had such a hard-working group. Once a week I had to present an essay for discussion with my economics tutor. That was a wonderful, mind-opening experience, but I did find it hard to keep up after so long away from academia.</p> <p>During my years in the army I was an atheist. In my first week at Trinity I was persuaded to go a meeting of the Christian Union (CICCU), and next morning I bought a Bible, which I had never read before. My conversion was instant and my new friends encouraged me into a very different lifestyle from the heavy drinking and smoking of five years in the army. I am now 80 years old and would have been dead long ago if I had continued on my previous course.</p> <p><strong>Fred Jarvis, 79, is former general secretary of the National Union of Teachers. He lives in London</strong></p> <p>My parents lived in West Ham and I was evacuated to Weymouth almost as soon as the war started, but nothing much seemed to be happening so we moved back to the East End. The very first bomb of the Blitz landed in the next street to us when I was on my way back from school.</p> <p>My father worked on the docks and he was transferred to Birkenhead, so I finished my education at Oldershall Grammar school in Wallasey. I wanted to stay on at school after 16, but my parents didn't have the money so I got a job in the education department and acted as a fire-watcher for the Home Guard in my spare time.</p> <p>I was called up to the 75th Highland Artillery regiment in 1943 and my active service began on D-day +4 when we were landed at Ouistreham. After the fall of Caen, we followed the German retreat through France, Belgium and Holland and my last active service was shelling Bremen in 1945.</p> <p>During my time in Wallasey I had been active in the Progressive Youth unit, and after the war ended I was put in charge of running various groups for German youngsters. At roughly the same time I was offered a scholarship from Ruskin College, which I planned to take up after I left the army.</p> <p>However, it was suggested I do a two-year social science course at Liverpool University, so I applied and was offered a place under the war veterans' access scheme. In August 1949 I got a call from St Catherine's College, Oxford, to say someone had dropped out and, as a result, I was admitted on a two-year PPE [politics, philosophy and economics] shortened honours course.</p> <p>The war had taken four years out of my life, so I took my studies rather seriously. I wanted to make up for what the war had cost me. Most of those who went up to Oxford at the same time as me were ex-servicemen, and my impression was we all felt the same way.</p> <p>I had always been a political animal and gravitated to those with similar views; but, even so, it did feel as if everyone took their responsibilities more seriously than they do now. Freedom had been hard fought for, and no one took it for granted. I stood as a Labour candidate for Wallasey in 1951 and became president of the National Union of Students in 1952; even Rupert Murdoch was in the Labour club.</p> <p>None of us talked much about the war: maybe we were a more reserved generation, or maybe we were just all so determined to look forward and build something new.</p> <p>I do think the character of Oxford changed as a result of the war. Because we were much older than the usual undergraduates, we tended to look on many of the academics as equals. Many of the barriers between students and academics broke down at this time, and some of the old petty rules and traditions passed into history.</p> <p>The war certainly changed my life. If it hadn't come along, I doubt I'd ever have gone to university at all.</p> <p><strong>Peter Green, 79, is the Dougherty Centennial professor emeritus of classics at the University of Texas at Austin. He lives in Iowa</strong></p> <p>I was at Charterhouse during the Battle of Britain and an oil bomb exploded 30 yards from my study, but my memory of the time was that the war was peripheral to my life at school.</p> <p>In 1942 I won a major open scholarship in classics to Trinity, Cambridge, but I wanted to join the RAF before taking it up. Curiously, I did my initial training in Cambridge itself and, unusually for a public schoolboy, enlisted as a Non Commissioned Officer (NCO). I was detailed to be aircrew but was passed unfit after contracting double pneumonia, and I was packed off to the operations room of Fighter Command.</p> <p>I saw out the end of the war in the far east, where I became acquainted with Paul Scott, who went on to become both a successful novelist and my agent. Thankfully, some of the more bizarre plans - such as landing a glider on the top of a hill in Mandalay - were never put into action, and I survived the war.</p> <p>Going up to Cambridge in 1947 didn't require major readjustments: being in the far east during the war had been so different, it was simply another world that never impinged on life in England.</p> <p>What the war did do was make my time at Cambridge even more enjoyable than it might otherwise have been. I'd grown up very quickly and, as an NCO, I'd already gone through the love affair with alcohol that so often takes up so much of an ex-schoolboy undergraduate's time, energy and money.</p> <p>Since a large proportion, not only of my fellow students, but also of my teachers, were ex-service, there was little sense of strangeness - classics had more than its share of wartime luminaries: Nick Hammond, Geoffrey Kirk, Maurice Balme, et al - and anyway, as I recall, we never talked about it: there was a strong sense of looking forward rather than back, of catching up on lost time.</p> <p>One of my best friends among the dons, John Raven, had been a conscientious objector: I admired his integrity, there was no sense at all of uncrossable divides. The only split I recall was when the Conservatives were running Air Marshal Tedder as a candidate for the chancellorship of the university, and Harry Sandbach asked me why there was this prejudice among the students against generals, admirals, air-marshals: \"Because we had to serve under them,\" I said.</p> <p>It's interesting that though the food shortages were still acute I don't recall being bothered by them: this may have been because I'd returned from the far east with a passion for curry, and if there was one thing Cambridge had and to spare - cynics said it went with a sudden shortage of cats - it was curry.</p> <p>One reason I had for sitting the (very tough) University Scholarship exams in classics was because the financial benefits were non-taxable: the proceeds could go on good wine as well as good books. We were most of us living on the proverbial shoestring, and I don't think anyone I knew owned a car.</p> <p>My experiences sharpened my passion for Greek and Roman antiquity, the study of which I found exhilaratingly civilised by comparison with what was going on around me, and shed a very clear light on contemporary problems. Unlike some, I never for one moment considered changing my field of study because of anything I had experienced during the war.</p> <p>Back in 1942, I was something of a fla\u00e2neur - clever and idle, and I'd probably have settled for a job teaching classics at a provincial university. Being away broadened my horizons, and the war concentrated my mind. From then on I was more focused and worked hard.</p> <p>I did find the older generation of Cambridge classicists in many ways inhibiting, and I'm sure they found me peculiarly irritating; but my postwar Cambridge experience still remains with me as one of the defining, and intensely enjoyable, experiences of my life.</p> <p><strong>Edward Drake, 83, retired in 1976 after a career in advertising. He lives in Warwickshire</strong></p> <p>I was working for Cadbury's in Birmingham when war broke out. My father had wanted me to go to university, but I'd seen my friends leave school and get jobs and I wanted to do the same. I wasn't that academic - or that well-behaved for that matter - so the headteacher was happy to get rid of me.</p> <p>I volunteered in 1941 and joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps - later the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers - and spent three years out in Alexandria. But by 1944 I felt further from the war in Egypt than the people back home, so I applied for a commission to join the infantry, and was accepted into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.</p> <p>After various detours through Palestine and Italy, I found myself fighting in north-west Europe. I was wounded on May 1, starting the last action before VE day near Lubeck. It was my own fault, really. You're always taught not to underestimate the enemy's strength, and I thought we were being pinned down by a single sniper from a signal box near the railway. It turned out to be a whole company of Panzer grenadiers and I was badly shot in the arm. That was the end of my war.</p> <p>Back home I realised what a chump I had been to have missed out on going to university before the war. Cadbury's had kept my job open and were happy for me to study for a degree. I decided I wanted to read French, as my languages had improved somewhat during my time in France and Belgium.</p> <p>I applied first to St John's College, Cambridge, and was turned down flat. I was told I had had my opportunity before the war. Luckily, the tutor at Downing took a different view. He saw the cast on my arm and offered me a sherry and a place.</p> <p>It was extremely daunting going back to academic study after so long away. My supervisor, FR Leavis, gave me a huge reading list and I did my best to work my way through it. It was always something of a struggle to keep up, though.</p> <p>There was a difference between us ex-servicemen and those who were fresh out of school. We all got on together, but I did tend to stick with the older age group. We had so many experiences in common, and often after dinner we would get together and discuss our lives in the war - or swap lies. I think we all felt rather sorry for those who were younger, as they didn't have our confidence to ignore the petty rules. One ex-serviceman was asked to turn his radio down: he wasn't asked again. After all we had been through, we weren't going to be treated like children.</p> <p>One particular experience sums up the difference between the two groups. Our JCR had decided to hold a May Ball, but the Master told us the college was not able to guarantee the expenditure involved. In the pre-war days, that would have been the end of the matter. However, our chairman asked what figure was necessary for the ball to go ahead. The JCR then wrote to former members of the college asking them to guarantee a sum, and the ball was a huge success.</p>",
  "Iraq's rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr vowed yesterday to stay in Najaf \"until the last drop of my blood is spilled\" as his militia fought gun battles across the country, including in Basra where a British soldier was killed and fiveothers were wounded. <p>The soldier died after two military Land Rovers were set alight and Mr Sadr's militiamen fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at their patrol. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence said British forces were attempting to calm the situation and avoid actions which might lead to an escalation in violence. </p> <p>\"There have been a number of incidents within the British area of operations in and around Basra,\" said an MoD spokesman. \"We regret we can confirm that a British soldier has been killed and there have been a number of other casualties. </p> <p>\"The situation is being brought under control, and whilst we continue to maintain our non-escalatory posture, we use force where necessary in self-defence.\" </p> <p>Fighting also spread to the southern city of Diwaniya, where militia were said to have surrounded the police station. In Sadr City, the eastern slums of Baghdad where Mr Sadr's movement is particularly well supported, the Iraqi government imposed a night-time curfew. </p> <p>In Najaf the young cleric defied a five-day onslaught by the US military to appear in public for the first time since launching his latest uprising. </p> <p>As his militia fought in the streets around him, Mr Sadr was led into a thickly carpeted room inside the Imam Ali shrine in the heart of the old city. There, before a stylised portrait of his revered father, he committed himself to a bitter fight against the US. </p> <p>\"I am staying in Najaf and I will not leave,\" he said. \"I am here as a defender of Najaf. I will stay until the last drop of my blood is spilled.\" </p> <p>In the streets outside, his militia, the Mahdi army, fired RPGs at American positions. US marines returned fire with heavy machine guns. </p> <p>\"I told the Mahdi army they are my brothers,\" said the cleric. \"They should call this the honest resistance. We are defending Islam.\" </p> <p>In April the 30-year-old led a series of violent uprisings across southern Iraq, the first time the Shia fought against the occupation. </p> <p>Eventually he struck a deal with the US military to end the conflict, but last Thursday that truce was broken, and fighting has raged since then in Najaf and elsewhere. </p> <p>Iraq was forced to stop oil production from its southern oilfields yesterday for the first time since the hand-over of power to Iraqi authorities in June, because of threats to sabotage the Basra-based state Southern Oil Company's operations. </p> <p>\"Pumping from the southern oilfields to storage tanks at Basra was stopped today after threats made by Sadr,\" an official told Reuters. \"It will remain stopped until the threat is over.\" </p> <p>The spectre of sabotage sent oil prices on the world's futures markets to record levels. The cost of Brent crude futures was pushed more than $1 higher to $41.65 and US light crude futures rose to $44.97, prompting fears that rising energy costs could derail global economic recovery. </p> <p>Mr Sadr has refused to take part in Iraq's political process, although he appears to be preparing to contest the elections which are due to be held next January. </p> <p>He said he wanted the Iraqi government put in charge of the US-led multi-national forces. \"When I see the Americans under their command, I will take part in their elections,\" he said. \"Now I am the enemy of America from now until judgment day.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr's presence in the Najaf shrine yesterday and the position of hundreds of his fighters throughout the old city suggested he remains in a stronger position than the US military has so far admitted. The cleric has ignored several ultimatums to withdraw. </p> <p>US commanders claim they have killed 360 militiamen, but there is no evidence to sup port this. </p> <p>Hussein Hadi, the deputy director of Najaf's main hospital, said yesterday that 23 people had been killed since the fighting started last week and 98 had been injured, mostly civilians. Among the dead were five Iraqi police and four Iraqi army soldiers, he said. The Mahdi army treats its injured away from the hospital. </p> <p>In Najaf's main police station officers showed off a room crowded with around 300 Mahdi army prisoners, each sitting cross-legged and facing the wall. In one corner there were several plastic water bottles filled with urine. Before they opened the door the sound of screaming had been coming from inside. </p> <p>Ghalib al-Jazairy, Najaf's police chief, admitted several of the captives were policemen from stations in Basra and Amara, who had joined the militia. He said police had arrested 1,200 people in the past week, but half had already been released. </p> <p>\"We have the law on our side and we will find anyone who doesn't respect the law,\" he said. </p> <p>On Sunday, Mr Jazairy's uncle, who was also his driver, was kidnapped by the militia and his car was stolen. In the car, the militia found documents written by Mr Jazairy to the interior ministry recommending that Najaf's water and electricity supply be cut off. He admitted writing them as a \"suggestion\" to the ministry. </p> <p>There was heavy fighting yesterday as the US 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit made a push into the ancient cemetery known as the Valley of Peace, just north of Najaf, but there was no sign of American troops inside the city. </p> <p>Just a block away from the fighting in the cemetery, half a dozen young militiamen lay resting on fishing nets in a dark, brick basement. </p> <p>They were a platoon from Khalis, a small Shia town just north of Baghdad, and had arrived in Najaf to fight four months ago. Several wore green silk headbands, signifying their commitment to \"martyrdom\". </p> <p>Latif al-Khalisi, their leader, spent his life under Saddam Hussein running from military service. He was sentenced to death four times for suspected membership of the Da'awa party, then the leading Shia opposition group. He welcomed the fall of Saddam. </p> <p>\"We had this happiness at the beginning, then the Americans came and they didn't fulfil anything for us,\" he said. </p> <p>\"All the rich people in the west came and started taking money and contracts in this country. The wealthy people in the west didn't think of the poor people in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Most of Mr Sadr's support comes from the poor, male, urban working class, and the militiamen complained about the lack of work. Many had been soldiers under Saddam. </p> <p>\"There are three kinds of job you can get now: a guard, a janitor or making sandbags for the American camps,\" said Muhammad al-Ajeel. </p> <p>\"And then there's the new Iraqi army. They are fighting with the Americans and tomorrow they might fight Iran or Syria. How can we join our hands with them?\"</p>",
  "Ralph Nader, the consumers' champion who became the scourge of Democrats for his determination to run for US president, faced a concerted challenge yesterday to his candidacy in a battleground state. <p>In two separate lawsuits, Democratic activists in Pennsylvania sought to keep Mr Nader off November's ballot. </p> <p>The move intensifies the war between Republicans and Democrats over Mr Nader's candidacy, a conflict fuelled by the maverick's willingness to accept funds and help from some of George Bush's most ardent supporters. </p> <p>Republicans are eager to see Mr Nader do well - not because of his stand on the environment or Iraq - but in the hope that he will tip the balance towards Mr Bush in the race against John Kerry, the Democratic challenger. But the Democrats have stood their ground, with activists harrying Mr Nader's effort to get on the ballot in several states. </p> <p>In the Pennsylvania lawsuits Democrats accused the Nader campaign of falsifying thousands of names on petitions endorsing his candidacy in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. His campaign was also accused of failing to pay the contractors who organised the petition and who allegedly paid homeless people a dollar for each signature. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Nader said only petition gatherers who turned in fraudulent signatures were unpaid. </p> <p>The Democrats took Pennsylvania by a relatively slim margin during the last election and party activists defended the law suits against Mr Nader yesterday. </p> <p>\"The bottom line for us is that we are partisan Democrats, and we are very much interested in getting John Kerry elected,\" said Michael Manzo, aide to a Democratic state legislator. \"We view Mr Nader's candidacy as a threat. Will it be a large threat? We hope not, but we are not willing to take any chances.\" </p> <p>Similar scenarios are unfolding in other states with Democrats fighting a rearguard action to keep Mr Nader out of the presidential race. </p> <p>In the battleground state of Arizona he was knocked off the ballot on a technicality, and the party is raising funds for legal challenges in Florida, Michigan, West Virginia and Nevada. </p> <p>Mr Nader dismissed the challenges as a display of insecurity. \"It shows the lack of confidence Democrats have in their own candidate,\" he told Businessweek magazine. </p> <p>However, among Mr Nader's new supporters this election is the billionaire Richard Egan, who was appointed ambassador to Ireland after raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for President Bush. Campaign monitors say other big Republican donors have contributed as well. In Oregon, also poised for a tight contest, two conservative groups admitted telephoning supporters to help put Mr Nader on the ticket. </p> <p>But even with the new-found patrons, he has made slow progress in his effort to get on state ballots. He missed a chance to get on the ballot in California at the weekend when supporters raised only half the 153,000 signatures required. </p> <p>But Democrats say that was Mr Nader's due when he decided to contest these elections, reopening the feud on the American left begun when Mr Nader drained off crucial support for Al Gore in the 2000 elections, handing Mr Bush his victory. </p> <p>With memories of that defeat still rankling, even some of Mr Nader's closest associates were outraged when he announced his candidacy earlier this year. </p> <p>That anger grew further when Mr Nader rebuffed a request from Mr Kerry to stay out of the race in key states. </p> <p>That is when the Democratic machine stepped in with Howard Dean, a hero to the party's left wing for his anti-war stance, deployed to herd wayward Democrats. </p> <p>One of Mr Dean's aides from his failed campaign for the Democratic leadership founded a website called the Nader Factor which documents Republican support for Mr Nader. </p> <p>Mr Nader is not expected to match the 2.8m votes he won last time. But some like John Zogby, the Democratic pollster, say that hardly matters. </p> <p>He said Mr Nader could hold the balance in several states - should he succeed in getting on the ballot. </p> <p>But his candidacy presents another challenge for the Democrats. </p> <p>\"He is the ghost of the left, he is the one who rallies the anti-war sentiment and Democratic populism, and so his presence in the race is casting a shadow on Kerry,\" Mr Zogby said. </p> <p>\"It's not going to be enough for him just not to be George Bush.\"</p> <p><b>States of flux </b></p> <p>A poll last week had Kerry on 48%, Bush 43%, and Nader 3%. If Nader gets on the ballots, and taking into account polls' margins of error, he can turn several states, including: </p> <p><b>Florida </b><br>Kerry 1% up on Bush <br>Nader 1.5% </p> <p><b>Minnesota </b><br>Kerry 1% up on Bush <br>Nader 2% </p> <p><b>New Hampshire </b><br>Kerry 4% up on Bush <br>Nader 4% </p> <p><b>Pennsylvania </b><br>Kerry 5% up on Bush <br>Nader 5% </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Source: Zogby International, Mason Dixon, the University of New Hampshire</p>",
  "<p>It is a truism that the advertising industry exists on bright ideas, but few can have been as dazzlingly lucrative as Roger Hatchuel's vision. </p> <p>Not that the International Advertising Festival was his brainchild. But when he took it over in 1987, it was a cosy assembly of advertising agencies which gathered in Venice to award each other trophies for creating the most original cinema spots. </p> <p>The trophies remained lion-shaped, the symbol of St Mark, a memorial to Venice, but the hunting ground was to be global. </p> <p>First, Hatchuel expanded the competition to include print and outdoor advertising, then in 1997, when the dotcom boom was still a faint rumble, he created the Cyber Lions to take in the nascent field of online. </p> <p>At this year's festival, Hatchuel announced that 2005 would see sections for radio, public relations and design. </p> <p>Agencies pay up to \u00a3370 a time to enter ads - even a bronze Lion might ensure that an agency in Kuwait, for instance, retains its local contract with a big motor manufacturer while a grand prix could mean the capture of a global contact from another big network. </p> <p>So the cynical would say the expansion is Hatchuel cranking up a money machine. But this is a man whose enthusiasm for advertising has been overwhelming since his days as a law student in London. Procter &amp; Gamble, Mediavision, Pearl &amp; Dean: he has spent one career as a respected hands-on adman and another as adland's impresario. </p> <p>Last year, as recession hit and agencies shed staff, he coined a new festival catchphrase: all work, no beach. </p> <p>Festival delegates duly stepped up the seminar programmes and kept the beach parties low profile. </p> <p>This year, he decreed, was \"the year of the client\". Top executives from big advertisers including P&amp;G, McDonald's, Nokia, Volvo and BMW duly booked their flights to Cannes. </p> <p>Many said they found the experience revelatory. Instead of talking to the account executives, they were chatting to the creatives - the guys (it is a male-dominated business) who spend months, and millions, shaping the public face of their product. </p> <p>Even for Emap, Hatchuel is going to be a hard act to follow. </p> <p>\u00b7 Phil Sommerich has worked on the Lions Daily News, the festival's newspaper, since 1997</p>"
