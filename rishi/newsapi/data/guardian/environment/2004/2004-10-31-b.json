  "I'm writing from California, where the presidential election is mainly a rumour, fed by cable news. Poor souls, we see only the barrage of television ads that now constitute the bulk of a modern campaign when they're excerpted on the news broadcasts - which they increasingly are. In one of this campaign's novel twists, many adverts are now made only to be 'released' to the internet in the hope of garnering free news coverage. <p>In the 1950s, fear-mongering critics foresaw a dystopian future in which political leaders would be 'sold like soap'. They were risibly wrong. Soap advertising rarely stoops to the level on which American political advertising, with its creepy background music, grotesque slo-mo footage and fear-inducing voice-over announcers, lives. </p> <p>California is on the outside looking in because this state is overwhelmingly pro-Kerry. The polls say so. And so we suffer our lack of inundation, due to this odd confluence of a political antique and the latest technology. The antique is the Electoral College, which distributes votes for president state-by-state, and its accompanying state legislation which, with a couple of exceptions, apportions those votes on a winner-take-all basis. The latest technology, gleaned from advertising, dictates that you focus only on likely prospects. In California, long since relegated to the Kerry column, there are none. A California Bush voter is, in effect, a wasted Bush voter. So for us, as for you, this excruciating year has been, aside from the fundraising, mainly a spectator sport. </p> <p>The local newspaper printed an opinion piece last Sunday about the man whom a recent book identified as 'Bush's Brain', Karl Rove. Liberal writer Neal Gabler offered the most dire interpretation of Rove's baleful influence on politics - even calling him, at one point, Machiavellian. Well, excuse the hell out of me. I thought this was a contest about life-and-death issues, the war, global warming, the future of the world's most conventionally powerful nation - you know, stuff like that. If you really wanted to win such a campaign, gosh, maybe you'd even like the operation to be run by someone Machiavellian. After all, if the toilet stops up, I call the plumber. </p> <p>Liberals, of the Hollywood variety particularly, evince the most exquisite dismay at the ruthless and unethical behaviour of the likes of Rove. Then they go back to chuckling indulgently at the less ethical, and less explicable, behaviour of the often-feral agents and producers in their own midst. At least Rove has the good manners not to behave like a spoilt three-year-old who's been kept up two hours past his bedtime. </p> <p>Democrats generally revel in the conceit that they're smarter than their opponents, while Republicans assure themselves they're more moral than the other guys. But, Bush is not the idiot liberals like to think. He's got a kind of reptilian cunning, and Rove taps right into that political lizard brain. Combined with fervid Methodism, you've got ruthless certainty. Bush also has excellent speech writers, and knows how to stick to the script. </p> <p>Kerry's way of vaulting over the threshold issue - are you tough enough? - has been to proffer his Vietnam resum\u00e9. When it was savaged by the Swift Boats for Truth ads, he spent the first three weeks of August not defending his own military record. When asked about this strategy, Kerry said his advisers wouldn't let him. </p> <p>The senator also has his own savant, a seven-time loser (in presidential campaigns) named Robert Shrum. His signature is a sort of throwback populism. In a recent New York Times Magazine article, Shrum was asked why the Kerry campaign was ignoring the centrepiece of his Senate career, a tough investigation that led to the closing down of BCCI, an international bank with drug cartel and - how's this for relevance? - terrorism connections. Shrum's answer: it's too complex for 'them'. Populism in action. So, Kerry's senatorial life is a self-defined black hole. Fortunately for him, there are no Machiavellians around to define it in more sinister terms. </p> <p>Bill Clinton has been brought in to 'make the sale' for Kerry. Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing similar last-minute work for Bush. How do you like your testosterone: straight, or mixed with steroids? </p> <p>One can excuse the still undecided for thinking this election boils down to a simple question: after the funeral, whom would you rather hang out with, the preacher or the mortician? </p> <p>For me, it's also a simple question. Bush has run a disastrous war. Kerry has run a feckless campaign. On Tuesday, the American people can punish only one of them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Actor and writer Harry Shearer voices Mr Burns and Smithers, among others, in The Simpsons.

  "<b>ABORTION</b> <br> <b>Countdown starts for Roe v Wade</b> <p>Dorothy Fadiman was a graduate student at Stanford University when she became pregnant, and begged her gynaecologist for an abortion. When he said he couldn't do it, she 'found a branch of the Mafia, paid someone $600 cash, and had a blindfolded, unanaesthetised abortion from a stranger'. The operation went so badly that, she remembers, 'the same gynaecologist who would not give me a safe abortion came to the intensive care ward and saved my life'. </p> <p>The year was 1961. In 1973, in the landmark Supreme Court ruling known as Roe v Wade, abortion was made legal in the US. It is now estimated that about one in three American women will have had an abortion by the age of 45. But the ability of individual states to impose restrictions on women's access to safe abortions has been gradually expanded since 1973. </p> <p>Now more than half the 50 states require parental notification for minors, and many states impose a waiting period and restrict public funding or insurance coverage - a situation which means that, in the words of one clinic director in Alabama, 'for young women and poor women, the desperation is already here'. Because they receive federal funds, US military hospitals abroad are not allowed to perform abortions on servicewomen or the wives of servicemen. </p> <p>Roe v Wade is currently upheld in the Supreme Court by a slim margin of 5-4. Since it is one of the longest-serving Supreme Courts in US history, the next President is expected to appoint one or more Supreme Court justices. Depending on who they are, and who retires, a woman's right to choose may be severely threatened. George Bush has said he is not in favour of a 'litmus test' which would force a judge to outline his or her position on abortion beforehand. John Kerry stands by the constitutional right to choose, and has outraged his fellow Roman Catholics by stating that the decision is 'between a woman, God and her doctor'. </p> <p>The hottest topic due to appear before the Supreme Court on this issue is the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It was first introduced in 1995, vetoed by President Clinton, and recently passed into law by President Bush. Three district judges declared the ban unconstitutional, and it is now on appeal. </p> <p>The ban refers to a procedure dubbed 'partial-birth abortion' by anti-abortionists. Medically termed 'dilation and extraction' (D&amp;X), it involves partially delivering a second-trimester foetus before puncturing the skull and suctioning the contents before final delivery. It is used very rarely, but because of its apparent brutality the pro-life movement has found an emotional argument. 'From a PR standpoint, it's a winning issue for them,' says Steven Emmert, of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. 'When they created the term \"partial-birth abortion\" they won the PR war.' </p> <p>'D&amp;X' first came to national attention in 1992, when Dr Martin Haskell, a physician in Cincinnati, Ohio, gave a paper on it. He and other doctors had begun to use the procedure when aborting foetuses with severe birth defects (undetected before 20 weeks), because doctors needed an 'intact' foetus to be able to advise parents whether future children were at risk. </p> <p>The banning of a specific procedure is unprecedented but, as Carol Tobias, political director of the National Right to Life Committee, puts it, 'we think if we want to protect unborn children we have to take it one step at a time'. </p> <p>Though there may now seem little to defend about D&amp;X as opposed to other methods, the ban is seen by the pro-choice movement as a symbolic step towards overturning Roe v Wade. 'It's not about a particular procedure,' says Emmert, 'it's about turning the public against abortion in general. And it's working: the frightening thing is, when we look at polling numbers, increasingly young women who have not lived through the days before Roe are more apt to say they are anti-choice.' Tobias says that overturning Roe v Wade 'will take a few years, but I certainly think it's possible'. </p> <p>Susan Cohen, director of Government Affairs at the Alan Guttmacher Institute in Washington, formerly part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, believes that a Bush win means 'we can anticipate more federal legislation restricting various aspects of access to abortion'. </p> <p>One of these is the Child Custody Protection Act. If passed, it would mean that, if a minor who lived in a state requiring parental consent crossed state lines to have an abortion in one that didn't, whoever accompanied her - friend, boyfriend, grandmother - could be jailed. In some states abortion clinic staff face daily aggressive protests. Since 1977 there have been seven murders, 166 arson attacks and 1,042 acts of vandalism at clinics. </p> <p>Dorothy Fadiman is now a 65-year-old maker of documentaries. She is married, has children, and has been nominated for an Oscar for a film she made about abortion. In the run-up to this election, she has been touring colleges in swing states, trying to keep young women informed. 'It's the stealth nature of the effort. Under the radar screen, they've been whittling away at all these rights. Now the liberals are saying, \"Where were we? Asleep at the wheel?\".' </p> <p><b>Gaby Wood</b></p> <p><b>JOBS</b> <br><b>Mixed messages in the Rust Belt</b></p> <p>It is called the Rust Belt and it extends in a wide arc across the north-east of America, from Buffalo in upstate New York to the car capital of Detroit hundreds of miles away in Michigan. </p> <p>It is a land of emptying factories and job losses. It should be safe Democratic territory. But in America's divided election of 2004, few things are simple and the issue of jobs is no exception. </p> <p>The Rust Belt runs across several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. All have suffered job losses. For some, voting for John Kerry is as natural as breathing. John Abdalla, chairman of the Democratic Party in Ohio's Jefferson County, says jobs are the key issue in his corner of the most vital swing state in the election. 'We just cannot stand any more of this,' he said. </p> <p>Jefferson County lies alongside the Ohio river valley and is full of towns that rely on the huge steel mills that dot its banks. But many are running on much reduced capacity. Some have closed. Joseph Brem used to work in one of them. But its workforce has been slashed, and his healthcare benefits have been lost. Now he is volunteering for Kerry's campaign. 'I will do whatever it takes to beat Bush,' Brem said. </p> <p>Brem said everyone in his hometown of Steubenville has a story about the decline of the mills. Their legacy is obvious. Huge murals celebrating the steel industry are painted on the sides of buildings on the town's main street. The hulking mill complex dominates the town, as do the scarred hills above it, decimated by decades of mining. </p> <p>Justice Smith pointed to the mill. 'This is a steel town. Both my grandfathers spent 40 years in that mill,' he said. 'Steel is everything here.' </p> <p>But there are other economic trends afoot. Smith lives in Steubenville, but works in nearby Pittsburgh as an advertising executive. New jobs have arrived in the Rust Belt. </p> <p>In fact, the traditional political orthodoxy - that job losses equals a boost for Democrats - has not held true in 2004. In Ohio, which has lost almost a quarter of a million jobs in the past four years, the race is still tight. The same is true in Michigan, where factory closures and layoffs have not yet put the state firmly in the Democratic camp. Bush is still campaigning hard and has the state firmly in his sights as winnable. </p> <p>Yet the situation is reversed in Florida. There the economy is booming and producing more jobs than anywhere else in the country. In the past 12 months, 125,000 new jobs were created. Bush won the state last time by a razor-thin, and fiercely disputed, margin of just over 500 votes. But this time round, Bush has failed to capitalise on the boom. The state could still vote for Kerry. </p> <p>There are two factors that confuse the picture. The first is that terrorism and the war in Iraq has trumped jobs as the main issue in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. </p> <p>David Griffey is a life-long Ohio steelworker, the son of a retired union president and a registered Democrat. Yet last week he attended a Bush rally in Youngstown, Ohio, and said he was voting for the President. 'Bush is trying to create peace around the world. The mistakes in Iraq are from the military. You can't blame the President for them,' he said. In Florida, that situation is reversed. The state is home to many veterans and families of soldiers. Many have turned against the war and will be supporting Kerry. </p> <p>The other factor is the economy itself. It has painted a confusing picture that has allowed both candidates to pick and choose what they want. Kerry has slammed the job losses and pointed to the fact that Bush is the first President since the 1930s to preside over a net loss of jobs. But the Republicans point to a low unemployment rate that matches the levels of the boom during the era of Bill Clinton. They also say that economic growth is healthy. </p> <p>That allows George Bush relentlessly to use the same stump speech phrase at rally after rally. 'The economy is strong and getting stronger,' he says. </p> <p><b>Paul Harris</b></p> <p><b>SECURITY</b> <br><b>Military's poll paradox</b></p> <p>Steven McHugh never planned a career in the military. But after al-Qaeda launched its attacks on 11 September, the 22-year-old from New Jersey told his mother that he believed it was the defining moment of his generation. So McHugh volunteered to fight those responsible. </p> <p>But where the army took McHugh was not to the war against Osama bin Laden, but Iraq. When he returned on leave to New Jersey in July his mother Mildred was shocked how her son had been changed in six months based near the city of Samarra. </p> <p>'He seemed like a different person. He had lost his best friend in his unit. He said that he had seen some terrible stuff. He was incredibly jumpy, looking at cars all the time as if they be a threat and dropping to his knees if he heard a loud noise.' </p> <p>What makes Mildred angry is that she believes her son's sense of idealism and duty was betrayed. Steven was sent to fight the wrong war. </p> <p>The result has been that for the first time in her life, the 44-year-old has started going to demonstrations. She says if the US electorate returns George Bush as President this week she is not certain how to deal with her disappointment with her fellow Americans. </p> <p>And for those like Mildred and her son, the appearance of the bin Laden tape has confronted them with the central paradox of this election: if security is the big issue, then how is it that after so many American deaths, the self-declared nemesis of the US is still free to taunt them? </p> <p>It is this question that has separated the two candidates' rhetoric most bitterly, as John Kerry has repeated again and again on the stump that he would have done it differently and concentrated his efforts on bin Laden. Bush, meanwhile, has accused Kerry of being inconsistent in his record of voting as a Senator on terror issues. </p> <p>Which leaves the question: would a Kerry presidency be any more effective in confronting the problems in Iraq or the elusive bin Laden? </p> <p>It is a moot point. In a speech in February in Los Angeles, Kerry articulated his vision for a new direction on the war on terror while admitting that the US was still committed to finishing the job in Iraq. </p> <p>On the fight against al-Qaeda, his proposals often appear as much a change of style and management skills as a grand departure into new territory, diplomacy and international consensus. </p> <p>Where Kerry does differ, though, is in dealing with issues around the problem - insisting on the need for a tougher line on money flowing through Saudi Arabia and a campaign of 'naming and shaming' those involved in financing terrorism. </p> <p>'The fight requires us to use every tool at our disposal,' Kerry said then. 'Not only a strong military - but renewed alliances, vigorous law enforcement, reliable intelligence and unremitting efforts to shut down the flow of terrorist funds. </p> <p>'To do this demands that we work with other countries instead of walking alone. For today the agents of terrorism work and lurk in the shadows of 60 nations on every continent. In this entangled world, we need to build real and enduring alliances. </p> <p>'Allies give us more hands in the struggle, but no President would ever let them tie our hands and prevent us from doing what must be done.' </p> <p>Among those unimpressed by either of the candidates' approach to the threat of al-Qaeda or Iraq is Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the Carter administration. </p> <p>Writing in the New York Times last week, he noted acerbically: 'Both candidates have become prisoners of a worldview that fundamentally misdiagnoses the central challenge of our time. President Bush's \"global war on terror\" is a politically expedient slogan without real substance... The predicament faced by America in Iraq is more complex than the solutions offered so far by the Democratic side in the presidential contest.' </p> <p>If one thing is certain, it is that whoever wins the election, soldiers such as Steven McHugh will still be fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p><b>Peter Beaumont</b></p> <p><b>SUPREME COURT</b><br><b>Tipping the balance</b></p> <p>With moral and cultural issues playing as large a role in influencing Tuesday's presidential election as security, money and war, the question over the future make-up of the US Supreme Court is the issue that neither candidate has wished to fully acknowledge. </p> <p>Beyond the prospect that disputed results in many states could once again put the outcome of the election in the hands of nine ageing justices, the next president is almost certain to have the power to affect the ideological balance of the court, which often divides five to four on controversial issues. </p> <p>With America's moral and cultural armies squaring off over gay marriage, stem-cell research and abortion, the power to appoint one or more new justices to the ideologically divided court is perhaps more important in the long term than who sits in the White House. </p> <p>Last week, the issue came into focus when it was announced the court's 80-year-old chief justice, William Rehnquist, was being treated for thyroid cancer. Rehnquist, an ideological conservative who has presided over the court for 17 years and who has seen the country move to the right since he was appointed by Nixon, is said to be ready for work next week in case there are election issues to resolve. </p> <p>But Rehnquist's illness placed both sides of America's cultural divide on notice. Three other justices have already been treated for cancer, and with all but one over the age of 65, the court is fast approaching a changing of the guard that makes the outcome of Tuesday's vote all the more important. </p> <p>It's 10 years since the last justice was confirmed; not since 1812-23 has it gone that long unchanged. Indeed, some commentators fear Kerry's first or Bush's second term could be dominated by nomination battles. </p> <p>Democrats see the court as dominated five to four by conservatives; Republicans see it as evenly split. Any change in the make-up could tip it further either way. </p> <p>'This election is not just about the next four years but the next 40,' says Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice. 'The new president or the re-elected president will have huge control over the future direction of the court.' </p> <p>Democrats fear that if Bush is reelected, he will follow a familiar pattern of judicial appointment. 'Ideology has triumphed qualification in Bush's judicial selections,' says Aron. 'He's looked for young ideologues with fixed hostilities toward civil rights, environmental and consumer protections and a woman's right to choose.' </p> <p>Despite his faith, Kerry has vowed he will not nominate a judge who does not support abortion rights. Bush, somewhat opaquely, says he'll name 'judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law'. </p> <p>Under a Bush second term Democrats fear a conservative could be selected to replace liberal John Paul Stevens, 84. And conservative groups fear a liberal successor to Rehnquist or to the committed conservative Antonin Scalia. </p> <p>'I don't think it is too much to say that the culture may well hang in the balance with the appointment of Supreme Court justices in the coming years,' says Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council. </p> <p>As an original opponent of abortion rights and supporter of invading neutral Cambodia in the early 1970s, Rehnquist has been a soldier for the right, helping to deliver the 2000 election to Bush, weakening the barrier between church and state, restricting the criminal appeals process and the reach of affirmative action, as well as reducing the power of Washington to dictate to the states. </p> <p>During this election the court has already made itself felt. Two weeks ago, it refused to hear an appeal by independent candidate Ralph Nader, against a lower-court ruling that kept him off the Pennsylvania ballot. And last week, Clinton appointee Justice Stephen Breyer admitted he wasn't sure he was being truly impartial when he voted against a recount in Florida in 2000 and thus gave Bush the White House. </p> <p>Still, there is little doubt that when Americans go to the polls next week, they will be voting on issues that will ultimately end up before the Supreme Court. Eleven state ballots, including four crucial swing states, carry an amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. </p> <p>It's the issue beyond others that has energised Christian evangelicals and other social conservatives. In Ohio, where polls are dead even, the Ohio Campaign to Protect Marriage claims to have registered 55,000 new voters on the strength of feeling over the issue. Both sides of the marriage debate say it could be the issue that swings the state, and potentially the election. </p> <p>And even if the election results do not end up before the court, it is likely that key national issues will be before it again in the near future. 'All you need is the retirement of one or two justices and rulings on abortion, affirmative action, gay rights and the death penalty can be in play again,' says John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. </p> <p>At the same time, scaremongering by both sides is rampant as both candidates try to motivate their bases. 'It's too big a leap to think all the big decisions of the last 30 years could be reversed,' says Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. 'Everything is carried to extreme in these last couple of days.'</p> <p><b>Ed Helmore</b></p> <p><b>They said what?</b></p> <p>'Too many good docs are getting out of the business.

  "<p>'Every Czech's a musician', goes the typically exaggerated yet illuminating saying. It became believable when I spent a few January days in beautiful Prague. From the Pilsner-stained flagstones of the jazz dens to the Rococo-frescoed ceiling of the State Opera House, the city of a thousand spires always reverberates to homegrown music. During the Winter Festival of classical and jazz music, six days are crammed with concerts, ballets and opera using four major orchestras and a whole host of Prague's elegant music venues. </p> <p>In the early days of the new year, the blackened Gothic skyline is artistically sprinkled with pure-white snow. Gingerly legging it up icy steps, we get to our first destination just in time. Two of the three pillars of Czech classical music, Leos Jan\u00e1cek and Antonin Dvor\u00e1k, are represented at a concert played by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (CPO) at its home in the wonderful late-19th-century Rudolfinum, on the banks of the River Vltava. This is like watching lions on the plains of the Serengeti: classical music in its original habitat. The Rudolfinum hosted the CPO's first concert when it was under Dvorak's conduc torship, and they have rehearsed and performed ever since in this cut-glass, walnut-panelled concert hall. </p> <p>First up is Jan\u00e1cek's Sinfonietta. As the conductor's baton taps silence on his lectern, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, along with the 10 extra brass instruments - trumpets, trombones and flugelhorns - on the bal cony above the full orchestra. They launch into a visceral rendition of the dissonant Slavic masterpiece. The acoustics of the hall and the performance are equally superb, with every instrument distinct. The programme's second half is an equally accomplished performance of the New World symphony by Dvor\u00e1k. It's a wistful letter home from the Czech who was spending three lucrative years in America - but its syncopated brass motifs have nevertheless been borrowed by the scores of every Western film ever made. </p> <p>As the music plays, I look up at the sculptures of famous musicians that line the balustrades; those on the roof were the cause of a blackly humorous incident played out in the late 1930s. The occupying Nazi authorities demanded that the statue of Jewish composer Felix Mendelssohn be pulled down. The statues are neither brilliant nor named, so the hapless workers assumed he'd be the one with the biggest nose. They pulled down Hitler's favourite, Richard Wagner, instead. </p> <p>After the rousing concert it's out, well wrapped-up, into the biting chill, and on to the stunning landmark Charles Bridge with its looming smoke-blackened statuary. A firework display forms a spangly backdrop to the ringing tones of the symphonic poems Ma Vlast (My Country), by the third patriarch of Czech music, Bedrich Smetana. They include the ode to the River Vltava, which takes its musical shape from the water's course through the country. The intense cold, the soaring music, romantic cityscape, fireworks and warming herbal elixir Becherovka make a heady combination. </p> <p>Hearing is not the only sense stimulated by this city - there are always things to look at, talk about, eat and drink. On the extraordinary astronomical clock ( Orloj ) in the Old Town square, the skeletal figure of death tinkles his bell for the hourly procession of apostles, Jews, Turks and cockerels. The Lanterna Magika - a unique Prague theatrical experience combining actors, ballet and film - provides a humorous break from the cold. Then there is the superb jazz on offer throughout the town. Perhaps the best is played at the Reduta Jazz Club in the New Town. Bill Clinton jammed here with Czech President Vaclav Havel in 1994 - it was either the pinnacle of liberal political cool or a dad-dancing-at-the-disco moment, depending on how deaf you are - but usually the music is superb. </p> <p>Nearby stands the wonderful National Theatre. It took 13 years to build, was burnt down within two months and miraculously rebuilt within another two years. Paid for direct from the pockets of the Czechs, it is a stunning building crammed with statues and frescoes of Czech heroes and pastoral scenes. </p> <p>The culmination of the Winter Festival is a performance of Mozart's The Magic Flute, held at the neo-Rococo National Opera House. Wolfgang Amadeus visited Prague four times and, although Austrian, is often claimed as an honorary Praguer. His opera Don Giovanni was dedicated to Prague and had its world premiere at the city's Estates Theatre on 29 October 1787. Writing of a ball held to celebrate the occasion, Mozart recalled that 'the cream of the beauties of Prague flew about in sheer delight to my Figaro '. Milos Forman's biopic Amadeus was filmed at the Estates Theatre and paid for a superb renovation which included replacing the bulbs with candles - sadly only temporarily. </p> <p>Sitting in a presidential box, sipping the Czech sparkling wine Sekt, and watching the Queen of the Night singing 'The vengeance of Hell is in my heart' is a slice of luxury hard to forget. OK, so the performance is a little amateurish and the Queen of the Night can't move and sing at the same time, but with the best seats costing \u00a315, who cares?</p> <p><strong>If you liked the sound of that ... try these winter music festivals</strong></p> <p><strong> Mozart in Salzburg</strong><br> 20-25/25-30 January Salzburg celebrates its most famous son with the annual Mozartwoche.

There are plenty of wet-weather activities at Center Parcs to stop the family getting cabin fever. The largely indoor centre in Longleat Forest near Warminster is especially good.

Bruges is a rare exception. Much of the town is medieval - cobbled streets, pretty stone guild houses and palaces - giving the place a villagey feel.

Cley Windmill sits at the edge of the county, overlooking saltmarshes and the sea. It's ideal for blustery walks and there's birdwatching at the Holme Dunes Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserve or Salthouse Marshes, where waders stride and brent geese rest in winter.

  "<p>The latest docu-film in the Supersize Me, Farenheit 9/11 vein is The Corporation (<a href=\"http://www.thecorporation.tv/uk\">thecorporation.tv/uk</a>). It takes a typical US corporation and analyses it, as if it were a person. It turns out that if it were a person, it would be a psychopath.</p> <p>The film shows that many corporations still violate basic human rights and ruin the environment, despite the fact that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the point at which enterprise meets ethics, was supposed to change all that. Usually credited to Keynesian economist J K Galbraith, CSR is a concept whereby companies realise that their actions affect society and the environment and so adjust them for the better. CSR should then transform business from a profit-obsessed monster riding roughshod over communities into an environmentally responsible entity. </p> <p>Although around since the Seventies, it's only recently that CSR has become a 'buzz concept', with glossy CSR reports everywhere. Naturally, corporations love to big-up their ethical achievements and CSR reports are full of pictures of CEOs with big hair, looking sincerely and responsibly into the camera. </p> <p>Occasionally a corporation shows some ethical progress. When allegations first surfaced linking Gap to sweatshops, the multinational was defensive. But in a 2003 social-responsibility report Gap came clean, admitting that many of its factories failed to comply with minimum labour conditions.</p> <p>But much CSR can be written off as 'greenwash' or a 'PR fig-leaf', tying in with Mark Twain's view that 'the secret of success is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake these, you've got it made.'</p> <p>Certainly Christian Aid (<a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk\">christianaid.org.uk</a>) is not impressed. 'Behind the mask: the real face of CSR' is a damning look at how some multinationals use CSR agendas to appear as paragons of virtue, while decimating the local environments of vulnerable 'fenceline' communities. And then there are the companies with shiny, squeaky CSR reports who earn big bucks selling arms to Mugabe.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's (<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk\">foe.co.uk</a>) annual 'Xpose' spoof awards ceremony celebrates this type of 'confusion between rhetoric and reality' by including an award for the 'best omission from a CSR report'. This year's honour went to BAE Systems, which omitted 'to mention it made weapons that kill people'. </p> <p>Through the Core coalition, (<a href=\"http://www.corporate-responsibility.org\">corporate-responsibility.org</a>), Christian Aid and Friends of the Earth are pressing for corporate behaviour to be governed by enforceable rules. Social responsibility would not be voluntary and corporations would no longer be able to 'pick and mix' a bit of CSR to make themselves look cuddly. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the CSR industry believes that children are our future. There's even an international Junior Ethics Movement (<a href=\"http://www.ja.org/ethics\">ja.org/ethics</a>) that teaches kids 'the right way to be successful in our free enterprise system'.

  "<p>In all the fuss this week about gambling reform, it's easy to overlook that we live in an economy that's founded on a casino. It's called the stock exchange. All trading is at root gambling, a link that is made manifest in the phenomenon of spread betting. A growth area in the $100 billion global gambling industry, spread betting allows you to gamble on the difference between the bookmaker's predicted spread of events and your own predictions. Well established for sporting events outside the UK for many years, it began and continues in the UK in financial markets. </p> <p>Whether on financial markets or not, the name on the spread-betting label indicates the nature of the game: if you're betting, you can lose money.Yet the warning appears not to deter us but to appeal to our innate 'gambling instinct'. What makes spread betting in particular so attractive, and potentially dangerous, is that it plays directly to the two elements that are acknowledged to hook gamblers: ease of access and frequency of the game. Spread betters can play by the second. The variety of betting opportunities is another attraction. During the Iraq war, for example, gamblers spread- bet oil contracts and even placed bets on the likelihood of Saddam's fall. </p> <p>Although we know that playing the markets is risky, it is not the markets that make mistakes - it is the humans who play those markets. How do we ruin our chances when we gamble? How might we manage the urge? </p> <p>Successful spread betters, traders, investors and gamblers all have something in common - knowing when to hold and when to fold. Why is timing a problem? Because most of us want to be doing something, anything. Under laboratory conditions, people are more than happy to trade away merrily even when they have been told that real opportunities are few and far between. In fact the longer the long shot the greater the thrill. But activity is not the same as judgment. Renowned trader Warren Buffet describes his investment demeanour as 'bordering on sloth', while Jesse Livermore traded himself to pre-Second World War speculative infamy believing that the big money was never made in the buying or selling, but in the waiting. </p> <p>Classic investment texts and great investors all speak about the huge impact on our wealth of our hopes, fears and fallacies. Human behaviour inhibits us from holding or folding when we should. While practitioners have been aware of this from at least the beginning of the last century, it is only in recent years that behavioural and even newer neuro-economists have come to accept the role of human emotions. What makes us tick and why we take economically 'irrational' risks are now seen as crucial elements of systemic economic analysis. </p> <p>According to the Nobel prize-winning Professor Daniel Kahneman, market participants place far greater emphasis on losses than on profits. As a consequence, they hold too long (to avoid the pain of loss) and fold too early (for fear of losing what they've won). Some people actually find profitable trades more stressful than losing ones; they take hair-raising risks on the downside and are mice on the upside. </p> <p>Why do we do this? Research with very young children and animals shows that, being less emotional than their adult human counterparts, they are actually more rational. By contrast, adults find it hard to take decisions independent of their emotional memory, in which financial losses have become emotional losses. So when they are losing, people tend to throw good money after bad, particularly if that goal is receding or elusive. </p> <p>If you gave someone 'perfect' spread betting rules that dictated when to hold and fold, runs of losses would still be inevitable. This statistical fact puts pressure on people's emotional tolerance. After seven losses in a row most people will exit their next profitable trade far too early. The memory of past pain pushes them to grab any pleasure they can. And this emotional tolerance is a critical reason why great trading ideas fail in practice. As Keynes tersely put it, 'markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent'. </p> <p>If you know that losses are the only inevitable thing in speculation - the house always wins - you want to ensure you do not lose money faster than you make it. The real question then becomes how much you are willing to lose on one trade. </p> <p>Stop-loss orders can be placed with the bookie to limit how much you lose on an individual trade. Defining how much to lose can be done in several ways. Although the rules of thumb are unavoidably simplistic, they are a huge improvement on just throwing money around. </p> <p>Making sure we lose money slowly only gives us the time to begin emotionally appreciating these facts. You must still have realistic expectations, coping with what psychologists call the illusion of control, perhaps the most naked exhibition of hope in gambling. People often believe they can make a difference using their skills alone, even in something as unequivocally random as a lottery. North American lotteries became popular only when people were allowed to choose their own numbers. In experimental lotteries people pay more for lottery numbers they can choose than for random ones they are given. </p> <p>Further research on gambling behaviour reveals other very human wealth-destroying pitfalls. Profiting from the improbable is more of an ego-boost than boring success. Even some fund managers put the enjoyment of occasionally beating the index before maximising wealth. The simplest way to avoid that type of behaviour is by not talking about your profits or losses unnecessarily. </p> <p>We also know that people are willing to overpay for the slightest chance that they can win something large enough to change their lives. Combining kamikaze odds with those times when we are chasing money is a recipe for wipeout - punters lose more in later races as they desperately bet on longer-odds horses to get back into profit before the day ends. Floor traders at the Chicago futures exchanges have been found to trade more heavily later in the day if they were not profitable earlier on. </p> <p>Playing the markets is a tough game in which we are our own worst enemies. Pre-empting weaknesses will give you a head start to see if your strategies are worth anything, before being human makes your best-laid schemes go awry. You need to know your enemy and why it behaves the way it does. </p> <p>Incorporating such knowledge into your betting strategies should help limit losses - and just possibly take some of the heat out of both the markets and the debates. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Professor Chris Brady and Richard Ramyar are at Cass Business School, which specialises in the study of gambling and trading behaviour</p>",
  "<p>The Queen has made a rare intervention in world politics to warn Tony Blair of her grave concerns over the White House's stance on global warming. </p> <p>She is understood to have asked Downing Street to lobby the US after observing the alarming impact of Britain's changing weather on her estates at Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk. The revelation gives an unusual glimpse into the mind of the monarch, who normally strives to stay above politics. </p> <p>Further evidence of the Queen's views on global warming will be seen this week when she opens one of the most high-profile conferences ever staged in Europe on the issue. She is keen for this to be interpreted as a symbolic and political statement. </p> <p>The Berlin summit will come a day after the US presidential elections and its outcome will dictate the tone of key climate talks. George Bush's administration has remained hostile to international attempts to reduce emissions of climate change gases. </p> <p>'There has been dialogue between Downing Street and Buckingham Palace on all issues relating to climate change including the US position and the latest science. She is very keen to get involved,' said one of the UK's most eminent experts on climate change, who agreed to speak to The Observer on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>He added: 'From her own observations on the climate she has become worried like the rest of us. She has made it clear she wants to raise the importance of the issue.' </p> <p>In addition to her own fieldwork, the Queen was inspired by briefing papers supplied by Blair's chief scientist, Sir David King - who has described the threat of climate change as greater than global terrorism - and John Schellnhuber, research director of the Tyndall Centre, where Britain's pioneering work on global warming is conducted. </p> <p>During this week's conference, Tony Blair, using a live video link, will hail a new Anglo-German alliance to persuade other countries, including the US, to reduce the impact of global warming. </p> <p>Schellnhuber, who this week will receive a CBE from the Queen for his work on climate change, added that the identity of the next President of the US, the planet's biggest polluter, would dominate discussions. </p> <p>'If John Kerry wins, there might be a better chance of an open dialogue, there might be a feeling we can start again. If Bush wins, then we will have to wait and see,' added the former chief scientist to the German government. </p> <p>Environmentalists believe that the Queen's intervention is likely to prove crucial, particularly as Blair has promised to make climate change a key issue at the G8 group of major industrial nations next year. </p> <p>Among those present for the Queen this week will be Sir David King, Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who sounded a fresh warning only last week about the perils of climate change. </p> <p>Bush has provoked international condemnation by refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol, the international treaty to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Russia's recent decision to sign the treaty has isolated the US on an issue described by Blair as the greatest environmental threat to the planet. </p> <p>Both Downing Street and Buckingham Palace refused to comment last night, in keeping with the convention that Prime Ministers do not disclose the content of conversations with the Queen. </p> <p>She is known to take an active interest in her weekly audiences with her Prime Ministers, for which she is carefully briefed: after decades on the throne, her political insights are said to rival those of senior diplomats. The conversations take place without private secretaries present and are traditionally never disclosed by either side - although the Queen did once admit that her most enjoyable audiences had been with Winston Churchill. </p> <p>On the rare occasions that the Queen does express a forceful personal opinion on political issues, protocol dictates the Prime Minister should raise it on her behalf with the appropriate head of state or minister - but discreetly, without compromising her. It is extremely rare for her views to become public. </p> <p>By contrast, Prince Charles has lobbied increasingly openly on political issues, often firing off handwritten letters - nicknamed 'black spider memos' in Whitehall because of his writing - direct to ministers on subjects ranging from complementary medicine to hunting.</p>",
  "The number of nurses who left the UK to work in America more than doubled last year, prompting concerns of an impending exodus and a deterioration in patient care. <p>There are also fears that the NHS, which has become increasingly reliant on the controversial policy of poaching recruits from developing nations to address its critical shortage of nursing staff, may be struggling to retain its foreign recruits as well as its home-grown professionals.</p> <p>A report published tomorrow will show that a record number of nurses left Britain last year to work abroad, lured by huge pay rises, bonuses and improved living and working conditions.</p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing, which compiled the figures, said it was particularly alarmed about the increase in staff tempted by America's recently launched aggressive recruitment drive.</p> <p>In 2002-03, more than 2,200 verification checks on UK-based nurses were requested by American employers, up from just over 1,000 the previous year. In the past year, US recruiters have embarked on a vigorous campaign to lure nurses from Britain across the Atlantic after a US government report said it needed an additional one million nursing staff over the next decade.</p> <p>The Nursing Times said that American companies were increasing their presence at job fairs in the UK and putting enticing adverts in the professional press. Some recruiters have offered guaranteed jobs to registered nurses who want to move to the States with their families.</p> <p>Packages offer salaries of up to \u00a339,000 a year, two months' rent-free accommodation, air fares, visas for all the family, educational opportunities, a green card working visa and the possibility of citizenship.</p> <p>There is already a critical shortage of some 30,000 nursing staff in Britain. In 2003 more than 8,000 nurses left to work abroad, the highest number in a decade.</p> <p>There are also concerns that the bank of foreign nurses which the UK relies on could also be lured to other countries. Hospitals in Canada and Australia are also suffering staff shortages and have embarked on recruitment drives in the UK.</p> <p>Beverly Malone, general secretary of the RCN, said the increase over one year was striking and, if sustained, could lead to a deterioration in patient care in Britain.</p> <p>'Up until recent years, it's tended to be a one-way street in the UK,' she said. 'Tens of thousands of nurses coming in, but relatively few leaving.</p> <p>'However, we are starting to see a worrying trend. With more than 8,000 nurses now leaving the UK annually, it is going to have a detrimental impact on the stock of nursing staff available.</p> <p>'There are also fears that the US has managed to double the number of nurses it has attracted from Britain in only one year. Last year we were recruiting from overseas with the US. Now they are recruiting from us.'</p> <p>Howard Catton, interim head of policy with the RCN, said Britain was on the brink of becoming a source country rather than a destination one in the global nursing market.</p> <p>'We are highly dependent on internationally recruited nurses - it is not an exaggeration to say that some healthcare organisations would cease to function without them.</p> <p>'But there are fears that these professionals may stay here for a year or two before moving on again to a country that offers better pay and conditions.'</p> <p>Chris Beasley, the government's chief nursing officer, said that steps were being taken to recruit, train and retain more staff.</p>",
  "When future historians of Northern Ireland's Troubles ask, 'Who won the war?' their collective reply will undoubtedly be contained in just one word - lawyers. <p>M'learned friends have certainly done rather well from the fall-out from 25 years of conflict. The battery of public inquiries, both present and pending, have become a massive money spinner for the legal profession, the sums earned in marathon investigations such as that into Bloody Sunday being both staggering and obscene.

Dr Chris Gilligan of the University of Ulster argues that what he terms the 'trauma' industry is also doing rather well out of the post-Troubles environment. </p> <p>In a paper delivered in Glasgow last Wednesday, Gilligan noted the growth in referrals for trauma counselling in recent years. Ironically, the UU sociologist pointed out, this rise in Northern Ireland people seeking psychological help did not correlate with any rising level in mental health problems. All the research suggested that there was little significant difference in mental health indicators before and after the 1994 ceasefires. Instead of an upsurge in mental health problems following the end of terrorist warfare, the levels of conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remained relatively constant. </p> <p>So what is going on here if the hard facts demonstrate that there hasn't been a significant upsurge in mental illness? Gilligan uses academe-speak to explain. He argues that the expansion in counselling was 'part of an increasing medicalisation of society and social issues'. Or to put it another way, the rise is down to the exponential growth in California-style psycho-ivel where the personal will always replaces the political. </p> <p>Gilligan focuses his thesis on ex-police officers diagnosed with PTSD. Controversially, he claims that their 'trauma' is more political than medical or psychological, that the sight of the old paramilitary enemy they militarily defeated sitting in government was the real basis of their mental anguish rather than some delayed psychological reaction to specific horrors witnessed during the Troubles. </p> <p>It would be unfair, however, to locate this fake-trauma synome down to one segment of northern society. Other groups like to portray themselves as 'victims', even those who perpetrated the vast majority of the violence from 1969. They retreat into medico-psychological excuses to escape from asking themselves fundamental political questions. </p> <p>Thus you have the unseemly, endless caravan of complaint-fest involving 'prisoners' groups' (loyalist and republican) talking about their pain. This, however, is merely a psychological mechanism to avoid the idea of human agency, the notion that they were free to choose between a life of terror and a life outside of that brutal universe, to elude their own personal responsibility in the carnage. </p> <p>More crucially still, donning the mantle of victimhood creates the illusion that the conflict in the first place was reactive, an understandable response to the injustices inflicted on their community rather than a deliberate political project. Masquerading as the great put-upon, seeing yourself as a patient in need of help, also avoids asking the most critical question of all: What the hell was all that for? </p> <p>Why, after all, do you think Gerry Adams goes around hugging trees on holiday? </p> <p>Tens of thousands of people simply got on with their lives after the Troubles ended, just as they did in Lebanon after the civil war and are doing in the formerly war-torn states of the Balkans such as Croatia and Bosnia. </p> <p>The masses in these two latter conflict zones didn't need an army of therapists, counsellors or touchy-feely quacks to 'ease their pain'. Instead they demonstrated one of the most admirable qualities of humanity - they bit their collective lip, refused to dwell in the past and moved on. </p> <p>Our own predecessors learnt the value of this long ago. In the century past they endured two world wars, economic depressions, poverty, pandemics and almost a half-century of incipient civil war but never sought the comfort of the couch or the soothing assurances of the psychotherapist. </p> <p>It is too easy to sentimentalise the working class, especially in a time when it has become weakened and atomised. None the less workers - in the trenches, on the factory floor or the picket lines - never broke down into blubfest-introspection. They faced hurricanes of steel on the battlefield and endured inhuman conditions both at home and work without the post-modern prop of therapy culture. </p> <p>Gilligan is right. Feeling their pain; treating them as passive victims (even the most active in the conflict); reversing the Sex Pistols' maxim that 'no one is innocent' with 'everybody is innocent'; it won't help society move beyond the Troubles. The 'first step' on the road to national recovery is to seek that one elusive palliative - the truth.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Coco Chanel, asked to explain the difference between fashion and art, elegantly replied that 'art appreciates in interest and value over time, fashion depreciates.' But art has lately become intensely fashionable. Its current dual status, as sexy but potentially enduring, makes it an immensely valuable tool of communication: cool, but capable of speaking viscerally at deeper levels of meaning. Which is how a group of British artists come to be in Mexico City, putting together a stunning exhibition of installations, video and works on paper.</p> <p>Vast, sprawling and polluted, Mexico is a multi-layered city: ancient, Spanish-colonial, modern. But not, probably, the first place you'd look for a major exhibition of cutting-edge British art. Not where you'd immediately expect to find Martin Boyce from Glasgow, installing his work 'Our Love Is Like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours', with its tree-like structures of fluorescent tubes, screens of metal fencing and shapes recalling half-destroyed park benches, the whole thing reminiscent of a crepuscular public space. Not, either, the first place you'd look for Mark Titchner, the London artist who has explored modernism through wall paintings, banners and billboards.</p> <p>But that would be to reckon without the British Council, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this week, and which has been quietly amassing an impressive collection of modern art for all of that time and showing it around the world. The British Council has sponsored Boyce, Titchner and other British artists to come to the teeming, steaming cacophony of Mexico City. What they achieve here, politically, will not be easily measured: art can only offer a subtle, slow-burn sort of diplomacy. It may be very valuable; we'll almost certainly never know.</p> <p>The British Council's job is to sell Britain around the world by way of culture. This can be an uphill struggle. Recent research by the Council in China, for example, found that among people aged between 25 and 34 who were well educated and had high incomes, only five per cent thought of Britain as a modern country. A British diplomat in Mexico told me that when Mexicans think of Britain, they typically think of beefeaters. As a result, British public diplomacy there is geared to getting across two messages: Britain is hi-tech; and Britain is a modern country.</p> <p>Art may be useful here: no one could argue that British art is not vibrant, intellectually engaged and global in its outlook and ambitions. At the same time, you can't go around telling people what they should find interesting about you. When, three years ago, the British Council approached the Tamayo Museum in Mexico City proposing an exhibition of our art, it was with the idea of sending a major Gilbert and George retrospective. But the Tamayo's director, Ramiro Martinez, didn't want Gilbert and George and he didn't want the YBAs. He wanted to know what was happening in Britain now, and he wanted his museum to be involved in deciding what about that was relevant to Mexico.</p> <p>As a result, the artists who are here installing their works for the opening were jointly selected by Tobias Ostrander, a US-born specialist in Latin American art who works at the Tamayo, and a curator from the British Council, Ann Gallagher. The show they have come up with is not intended to be a summation of where British art is now, even if such a thing were possible; 'rather,' according to Ostrander, 'it's a themed show with British artists.'</p> <p>The theme is the city. Mexico is the biggest city in the world (depending how you measure it) and one of the most dangerous (locals told me the only place riskier was Bogot\u00e1). Some of its inhabitants are off-the-scale rich: Mexicans would be well represented in a list of the wealthiest people in the world. Prices are as high as in London. </p> <p>At the same time, it is also extremely poor. This is the capital of a country whose second-largest source of GDP, after oil, is receipts from nationals working abroad, mainly in low-grade jobs in California.</p> <p>Vast areas of the city are dirt-poor. The infrastructure seems unable to take the strain: visitors are advised not to take taxis because the drivers may be in league with kidnappers. Mexico is a thick soup of cultures, often highly sophisticated; 'a city that's exotic for foreigners, where people are acutely aware of its foreignness,' as Martinez says. But it is also a city that provokes passionate attachment: 'People defend their belonging to the city, in a way like they do in New York.' </p> <p>So the artists selected from Britain, with their works on paper, videos and installations, all have something to say about this - about the sensory experience of the city, its smells, noises, and textures, about our relationship with its modernist ambitions and motifs, and about the emotions engendered by living with its artificiality and gritty realities. The show is to be called Sodium and Asphalt, words that, helpfully, are almost identical in English and Spanish.</p> <p>Twelve British artists are showing, although Oliver Payne and Nick Relph, who work together, should perhaps count as one. Six are in Mexico for the opening (David Batchelor, Kathrin B\u00f6hm, Martin Boyce, Rosalind Nashashibi, Melanie Smith and Mark Titchner); Jim Lambie and his technician have been and gone. Others will come in a few months, when the show moves north, to Monterrey. </p> <p>Tobias Ostrander visited Britain twice, seeing the studios and galleries of artists who interested him, concentrating in the end on London and Glasgow (the Glaswegian art scene is particularly vital at present; four of the selected artists were from the city). </p> <p>Before starting on the project, he knew the work only of a handful of the artists. 'I knew Richard Wright's work, so when I went to Glasgow I made sure I saw him. I'd seen Jim Lambie's work in New York, and also David Batchelor's; I also knew of David Batchelor as an important writer and teacher.' (Batchelor is the author of an influential, and in this context highly relevant, book about colour, Chromophobia.)</p> <p>'In Glasgow we saw Rosalind Nashashibi's video, \"The State of Things\",' Ostrander says. The video features women sorting through old clothes at a jumble sale, and is lingeringly, almost languorously shot. 'We were both drawn to it. That ended up influencing considerably how we thought about the textures of the city - its recycled materials, trash, its slowness.'</p> <p>Ann Gallagher paid reciprocal visits to Mexico City to explore the preoccupations of local artists and identify points of contact. She and Ostrander were in email contact for months, exchanging images and ideas. </p> <p>'Although this is a show about British artists,' Ostrander says, 'it also questions what it means to be British.' Melanie Smith arrived in Mexico City a decade ago and never left: one local critic told me that as far as the Mexicans were concerned, she was only on loan to Britain for this exhibition. Another of the artists, Kathrin B\u00f6hm, is German by birth, although she did postgraduate work at Goldsmiths, lives in Hackney and has an office/studio in Camden. Rosalind Nashashibi, who is based in Glasgow, is half-Palestinian. Nick Relph and Oliver Payne do much of their work in New York. </p> <p>In Albion, one of the best of the small landfill of books and academic papers that has been produced in the last 20 years agonising over what Britain stands for in a globalised, post-Cold War world, Peter Ackroyd argues that 'the power of Anglo-Saxon culture springs in part from absorption and assimilation ... it can be maintained that English art and English literature are formed out of inspired adaptation; like the language, and like the inhabitants of the nation itself, they represent the apotheosis of the mixed style.'</p> <p>One of the most appealing things about the British Council's proselytising on behalf of British culture is its inclusiveness about what our culture might be. When I visited the Council's permanent collection, Andrea Rose, head of visual arts, had told me of her department's eagerness to claim Anish Kapoor for Britain. Kapoor, who arrived in Britain from India at the age of 17, represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1990, a move that kick-started his career; he has maintained a warm relationship with the Council ever since, and donated works to the collection.</p> <p>Only a couple of elements in Sodium and Asphalt are from the British Council's permanent collection: a couple of glittery turntables by Jim Lambie, made from his usual recycled, junk-shop materials, alluding to the club scene in Glasgow, where Lambie was a band member and DJ; and a work on paper by Richard Wright '(not titled 31.3.04)', a faux-wood surface, beautiful in the way of meticulously executed original work, and yet representing something entirely cheap and fake. </p> <p>If Ostrander and Gallagher hadn't wanted so much that was site-specific, they could have put together any number of exhibitions from the permanent collection. The Council mounts an average of 60 shows a year, featuring 4,000 works. A couple of weeks before going out to Mexico, I'd visited the warehouse round the back of a bus garage in Acton, west London, where its store of treasures is housed, to see how the operation works.</p> <p>No sooner was I through the door than I came face to face with a vast yellow and primary-hued piece, 'Diana As An Engine' by Eduardo Paolozzi, which was just back from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tehran and Pakistan. Round the corner I almost tripped over a dizzying Bridget Riley; hanging on the wall beside it was an Antony Gormley sculpture, a huge nude with outstretched arms. </p> <p>I spotted a Grayson Perry pot on a table and a Tracey Emin blanket, which someone said offhandedly was 'probably going to Colombia'.</p> <p>It was all very odd: tucked under the Tube line where it peters out into west London was one of the most extraordinary and least-known collections of modern and contemporary art in this country - 8,000 works, representing every significant artist of the past 60 years, from Henry Moore to Damien Hirst, Lucian Freud to Rachel Whiteread, Bridget Riley to Sarah Lucas. The collection is quintessentially British, but only 10 per cent is ever in this country at any one time. Its role is to be out on the road, in Tehran and Turkmenistan, Bangalore and Mumbai, Bogot\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo.</p> <p>Co-curated exhibitions such as Sodium and Asphalt are not the norm, although increasingly, many shows involve some reciprocal local involvement - so, for example, a design exhibition that has been touring India this year and is due to travel to Australia early in 2005 has acquired a tour 'appendix' from every country or region visited, exploring the exchange of design ideas to and from the host area and other cultures. Featured artists often give lectures and host workshops: Richard Deacon, Bill Woodrow and Anthony Caro all flew out to a show of 20th-century British Sculpture in Iran this spring and met young Iranian artists, while Michel Muller of the Henry Moore Foundation ran a bronze conservation workshop and Tim Marlow, director of White Cube, and Tate Britain's director Stephen Deuchar both gave lectures.</p> <p>The operation is all the more impressive given the limitations of the British Council's budgets: in practice, there is roughly \u00a3100,000 a year available (out of a total grant of \u00a32.2m) to buy new work. This requires that the Council buys cleverly, mainly when artists are young and their influence unproven. One reason the acquisitions policy is so successful is that the Council has a very high-powered advisory committee. Currently chaired by the director of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, this includes the directors of the National Gallery, Tate Britain, the V&amp;A, the Whitechapel, the Hayward, the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, the Liverpool Biennial and the Henry Moore Foundation, plus one art critic (Richard Dorment at present) and one artist (currently Richard Wentworth, who also happens to be Master of the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at Oxford). It meets twice a year, but is feeding through information and insights all the time.</p> <p>The Council doesn't buy speculatively; it acquires works because of their fit for a particular set of projects. Andrea Rose shows me a recent acquisition by Toby Ziegler: a huge, hi-tech piece that's almost mystically reflective. It was purchased with a view to touring the Middle East, currently a high priority, but where figurative work can be seen as anti-Islamic and the sex-and-scatology content of some contemporary art can be a problem. It will form part of a New Abstraction show, for which it may take two years to assemble the right pieces. Obviously it would be easier and cheaper to borrow, and the Council will happily do so. But much of the work sitting in the warehouse on the day that I visit (including a new Damien Hirst, 'Resurrection', featuring a human skeleton) has just come back from Tehran. When the Iran exhibition was first being discussed, so was war in Iraq. The places that the British Council most wants to go are precisely those that the owners of much-loved, fabulously expensive artworks are least likely to want to risk sending them for months on end.</p> <p>In the warehouse, I see the first work the British Council's visual arts department ever acquired: a chocolate-boxy painting of a farmhouse, by Duncan Grant, a bucolic idyll of a certain kind of Britain. This inward-looking nation is not the one that the Council wants to promote any more. Its activities are much better summed up by its decision to send Sam Taylor-Wood to St Petersburg this winter to premiere two new videos; or indeed, by its eagerness to work with a Mexican curator on exploring common preoccupations in Latin American and British urban centres.</p> <p>'The foreign office sets the geopolitical agenda - the mission to younger audiences, East rather than West, the Islamic world and China. Editorially, we are independent,' says Andrea Rose. 'When we went to Iran earlier this year there was a definite sense on the part of people we were meeting and talking to of, \"Why aren't we part of the rest of the world?\" We can use this collection far more subversively than people realise.' </p> <p>In Mexico City, a pollution smog hangs over the city, obscuring the surrounding mountains: the altitude-thin air is thick with fumes and the press of people. It's the day before the opening. But the Tamayo Museum is air-conditioned and peaceful in the way of big, concrete modernist spaces, and the artists are managing to remain fairly calm, despite last-minute hitches. 'There's a very different energy in Britain now from the YBAs,' says Ostrander; 'especially the Glasgow scene: it's much more relaxed. There's far less ego: a really generous attitude.' The artists who have come out for the opening are distinguished by a thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness: one of the strongest themes in the show is a powerful, shared critique of formal abstraction. But they are also friendly, unprecious and easy-going.</p> <p>Kathrin B\u00f6hm is still sticking bits of paper to the gallery walls. Her work is part of an ongoing project called 'and millions and millions', which involves her pasting cut-up pieces of hand-printed and offset posters on the wall in a collage of flat, coloured, geometric shapes, often layered on top of each other. She works slowly, cutting out shapes, tacking them up with tape, on different parts of the wall and even different walls at the same time. The process is hypnotic, and confusing - why has she built up so much over there and nothing over here? It looks as if she will never be ready. </p> <p>Martin Boyce has spent the last few days installing his half-lit urban park, to which I keep returning, because in spite of its evocation of a vandalised space, I find it mysteriously inviting. But one of his three fluorescent tube-trees is too bright. Since Mexican dimmer switches won't work, another has had to be sent from Britain. Unfortunately, Mexican customs are holding it to ransom and want $150 for its release. Mark Titchner's giant billboard went up more easily than he expected A maelstrom of colour and patterning, it makes reference to computer punchcards, to the way that utopian and radical ideas are seized by the market, by advertising and hype, and reduced to banal slogans. The effect is compelling, resonant with colour and life. Unfortunately, it is also too long for the wall, which isn't straight. Obviously, he doesn't want to cut the end off, but neither does he want it hanging off the wall.</p> <p>Melanie Smith's piece involves a series of paintings in bright synthetic colours, using airbrush techniques, to produce linear optical effects recalling the work of Bridget Riley. She has stacked these against the gallery wall, and shows them in conjunction with five videos (the monitors resting on cardboard boxes): images of Mexico's streets, alluding to the sensation of groundlessness experienced in the city. She has been into the gallery and turned up the sound so that it's aggravatingly loud.</p> <p>Richard Wright isn't here, but he's sent a set of posters that he wants flyposted around the city, in addition to the works he is showing inside. Tobias Ostrander has the posters spread out in front of him on Jim Lambie's reverberating gaffer-tape floor. The posters are beautiful and I'm not surprised when Ostrander tells me a set is worth about $15,000. </p> <p>He's talking to someone who flyposts for Mexican wrestling about where to put them. 'They'll be photographed. And then they'll probably be damaged. But that's good. That's what he wants.'</p> <p>Richard Gough, the technician who is here to oversee the unpacking and installation, takes me out to the back of the museum, where the British Council's trademark powder-blue packing cases are stacked (the Tate uses yellow cases; the National Gallery dark green) and talks about his work with nerdy enthusiasm: 'This case was made for a Rachel Whiteread exhibition seven months ago. It's been to S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio.' Like several of the other British Council technicians, Gough was trained as a fine artist. He has reason to be proud of his packing: Diana Eccles, who is in charge of the collection, told me that nothing had been broken in 70 years of constant shuttling around the globe. The objects and paintings being transported are often terrifyingly valuable, uninsurable other than by government indemnity. 'If we did break something,' says Eccles, 'we'd probably go out of business.'</p> <p>The works for Mexico, or the materials required to make them, were wrapped in acid-free tissue, hermetically sealed in polythene, padded around with inert foam (to prevent vapours) and carefully packed in blue boxes to be air freighted. Swaddled and sealed like this, they are safe from cold, heat, humidity and vibration. They must be unpacked in the presence of someone from the British Council, and the contents and precise disposition of each layer noted, so that they can be packed up again in exactly the same fashion. </p> <p>Eventually, the dimmer switch is released. The gallery's lighting is fine-tuned so that it doesn't bleed into the wrong spaces. Melanie Smith's volume is turned down. The last pictures are secured on the wall and the fixings painted over. (They are lower, Ann Gallagher notes, than in Britain, because people in Mexico are shorter; in Germany pictures are hung higher.) The Tamayo technicians manage to build an extra bit of wall behind Mark Titchner's overhanging billboard. Kathrin B\u00f6hm stops, apparently randomly. She puts out posters for people to take, so they can try it at home. The floors are swept for the 20th time, tea lights are placed all round the walls of the foyer. Everything is more or less ready for the opening.</p> <p>The target audience is the usual one for the Tamayo; the director of the British Council in Mexico makes the point that he's not running a development agency, so his target market is not the inhabitants of the city's slums. It's key decision makers, such as the Minister of Culture; then advisers and the press; and thirdly, young people who themselves aspire to be decision makers, and who may also be interested in studying in Britain, since the Prime Minister has pledged himself to increasing the number of foreign students at British universities.</p> <p>Everyone is pleased, because the Minister of Culture turns up, and she doesn't usually bother with openings. A leading Mexican critic talks to me approvingly about bridging the cultures, about pop influences, references to the grid of the city and the poetry of its patterns. The British ambassador tells me that the Mexicans and the British share a sense of humour and predilection for not taking ourselves too seriously. The embassy, she adds, is working with the Mexican government on reform of the civil service and of the judiciary. With a nod to the customised nature of this show, she says, 'They like working with us, because we don't say: \"Here's one we made earlier.\"'</p> <p>One critic tells me he can't find enough political statement, and was expecting something 'more crude and direct'. But on the whole there's an atmosphere of goodwill. The leading critic, Cuauhtemoc Medina, says he's intrigued by the 'rather peculiar, not easily explicable dialogue between Mexico City and London'. (At the time of Sodium and Asphalt, six Mexican artists are exhibiting in different venues in Britain.) This dialogue is curious, he adds, given that Britain wasn't the colonial power, isn't the real power now, and there's no large immigrant population. In common with the British ambassador, he thinks it must have something to do with sensibility, 'with sense of humour and directness'.</p> <p>Nicholas Serota, who sat on the advisory board of the visual arts department for 30 years, once claimed the British Council offered a Rolls-Royce service. Andrea Rose prefers to think of it as a Land Rover service: 'I like to think that, like the World Service, we're there when everyone else is asleep.' The Council goes into places that are often tough and inhospitable, with its James Bond mission to show what we're capable of, in all our diversity and heterogeneity, our eclectic, adaptive pragmatism.</p> <p>It is impossible to measure what might be the effect of sending the work of a dozen British artists to Mexico, either now or in the future. But it seems only common sense for artists to share their intellectual and emotional insights. Like the World Service, the British Council's visual arts department isn't susceptible to the current obsession with targets, but one senses, nevertheless, that it's an institution about which we can probably allow ourselves to feel proud. The UK - four countries with an uncertain commitment to being a nation - seems particularly troubled by the legacy of its past and its part in the global future. It is a paradox that a nation so uncertain about its place in the modern world does propaganda for its place in the modern world really rather well.</p>",
  "<p>Casinos are a dream vehicle for the money launderer with dirty notes to put into the system. Money goes in and out of casinos with such speed and in such quantities that regulators struggle to track it efficiently. That is why the law places great reporting burdens on companies that operate casinos. </p> <p>Casinos are treated as financial institutions in much the same way as banks and are subject to money laundering regulations contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The owners of casinos are likewise subject to scrutiny and their anti-money laundering procedures must comply with defined reporting procedures. </p> <p>Casino reporting and regulatory systems, even when they are well implemented, are regarded by the law enforcement community as vulnerable to abuse. The prospect of the creation of additional and larger casinos fills police with dread. One concluded: 'The present proposals are bound to add to London's laundering risk. The scheme is barking mad.' </p> <p>One risk is the system's vulnerability to abuse by an outsider. In 1998, four employees working at three casinos in Nevada were charged with laundering $400,000 for undercover agents whom they believed to be drug traffickers. </p> <p>Money laundering through casinos started with the drug, hooch and mafia barons in the United States in the Twenties and Thirties. They set up gambling dens in offshore centres like Cuba and the Bahamas to hide their dirty money from the authorities' gaze. These off-shore locations might today be the chosen bases for online casinos, as local regulation is minimal. </p> <p>Many casinos today are very reluctant to accept cash and anyone who seeks to buy their chips with large quantities of cash is likely to be the subject of a report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Like banks, casinos must make a report on anyone seeking to spend \u00a310,000 worth of cash or more. </p> <p>But many casinos will require a punter to use a credit card to pay for his chips. That allows the casino to identify the user, as well as the source of his cash. 'Casinos have bought into the \"know your customer\" regime applied to banks,' said one investigator. 'The days when they were laundromats for dirty cash have gone.' Casinos are also required to register large cash payouts to protect them against a money launderer falsely claiming he won dirty money at a casino. </p> <p>The grand buildings in central London or the provincial leisure and shopping facilities planned by the government offer little money laundering risk. The real worry today is the abuse of online casinos. Control in cyberspace is minimal and the scope for abuse great. </p> <p>One investigator told of a drugs baron who lived the life of Reilly in the West Indies. His bank account was in his home town and he wanted to pull together in a single account the profits from his drugs business, which were scattered around the world. </p> <p>His solution was dangerously simple. He set up an online casino based on his West Indies island. He then gave each of his operatives a credit card and told them to gamble away a fixed sum on his casino. Their losses were clearly the casino's gain, and he deposited them at the local bank. The mafioso paid the credit card bills with his dirty money, so ensuring both the transfer of the earnings to his account, and the removal of some compromising cash. </p> <p>'Online casinos are ready-made for money laundering,' says Michael Adlem, the managing director of Protivity, the UK risk consultancy. 'This criminal activity relies on the use of credit cards, and the only way it can be stopped is if Visa and Mastercard are excluded from the gambling arena. That would kill online laundering stone dead, but the credit card firms would resist it fiercely. For them, it is a money machine.' </p> <p>'Due diligence of online gambling is not as stringent as it is in other financing institutions,' says Frank Yu of Hong Kong's Ion Global. 'The online gambling site can be properly legitimate. But many fail in performing the due diligence of finding out who they are accepting money from and who they are giving money to.' Similar concern was expressed by Rick McDonnell, the head of the Asia Pacific Group money laundering division, a part of the Financial Action Task Force. 'Internet gambling is a vulnerable area. It is a risk.' </p> <p>One scam of casino owners engaged in money laundering is to doctor high-payout slot machines. They have been known to use sophisticated technology to override the machine's random system, using a 'back door'. They then arrange for someone who is part of the plot to make a big win. The 'winner' has not had to supply the casino with personal details, as he would have to do if he were a conventional gambler, and the money is taken without the casino making a report.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dizzee Rascal</strong><br> Leeds University Union</p> <p>19-year-old Dylan Mills has achieved so much in the past 14 months - from scooping the Mercury Music Prize for his astounding debut Boy in da Corner to club, festival and TV appearances of ever-increasing stature, to last month's follow-up album, Showtime, that it comes as a shock to realise that this is actually his first proper UK tour. </p> <p>He may have received a surprisingly healthy reception in the States, but some would argue that Dizzee faces a harder task in trying to take such an intensely symbiotic urban sound into the provinces of his homeland. Born and bred in the east London estates of Bow, Hackney and Tower Ham lets, the sound and culture of Grime is one firmly set in a world which, you would think, would be alien to the majority of the audience in Leeds University union. </p> <p>If anyone can take the grimy underground overground, however, it's Dizzee. Showtime demonstrated clearly an expanding of horizons, both geographically and musically and, while it may be a bit much to claim that his sophomore record can do for him what A Grand Don't Come for Free did for the Streets, it certainly cements his position as the country's foremost MC. </p> <p>Rising rapper Taz does an impressive job of warming up the crowd - a mixture of fresh-faced students and huddles of those who look more like students of the street, topped with a sprinkling of prime examples of thoroughbred west Yorkshire chavs. But tonight is all about the boy in the other corner. Arriving on stage to a rapturous reception, with only a behemoth of a DJ and a fellow back-up MC for comfort, the little Rascal at first perches on the DJ's riser, from where he spits out his first few rhymes. But if curious elements of the crowd need a crash course in Dizzee they soon get it, as he launches into the title track from his second album in trademark machine-gun a cappella. MTV once measured the speed of Dylan Mills's rapping and calculated he could rattle off 86 words in 15 seconds. Speed and skill such as that have to be seen to be believed, and when Mills scatter-guns 'Showtime' across the crowd, he's won them over. After a collective gasp of disbelief, they go suitably berserk and, from then on, they're pure believers. Don't let anyone tell you different - they get grime up north. </p> <p>He might need more than a backdrop of his album's artwork visually when he steps up to larger venues, but tonight, Dizzee's pure energy and non-stop barrage of rhymes are more than enough to fill the venue, with even the most guilty of feet responding to the fractured rhythms. </p> <p>All the big tracks from his debut go down a storm, from the breakthrough single 'I Luv U' to the ballsy nonchalance of 'Jus' a Rascal', to the incendiary 'Fix Up, Look Sharp'. He's not afraid to address the crowd between tracks, although 'Who's working class?' draws a more muted response than his request 'Let's see ya L's' , which prompts the crowd to raise their right thumbs and forefingers in an L-shape. 'The L's for London' he nods in appreciation, before adding 'and Leed...Leeds knows the score.' </p> <p>He returns briefly for an encore of 'Stand Up Tall', his previous single, and as he raps 'Sounds of the young star Dizzee Rascal, don't give it half-hearted, give it all', it seems as if everyone is giving it at least that, with those down the front of the crowd almost pogoing as one. Dizzee new heights, indeed. </p> <p>'How am I gonna pull this one off, man?' Mills asks self-mockingly in the intro to new single 'Dream'. You just did, kid. </p> <p>Dizzee Rascal plays Norwich UEA, tonight; Bristol Academy, Tuesday; London Forum, Thursday</p>",
  "<p>For a moment forget about the charge sheet against Messrs Bush and Blair - the alleged lies about WMD or the illegality of the invasion of Iraq - and glance at the bigger picture. Global terrorism, global poverty and global warming form a toxic trio that promise a catastrophe that will make the horrors of 9/11 look like the Boston Tea Party.</p> <p>Do I exaggerate? In the Middle East untold thousands of Arabs are being slaughtered by US warplanes and artillery, supported by the British, to impose Western democracy on Iraq at the point of a gun. In Beirut, once dismembered by civil war but now at ease with itself, the young parade through the squares with grace and elegance. But listen to what they say and you discover a coruscating sense of humiliation and a deepening rage against America, startling in this most genuinely Westernised Arab state.</p> <p>Aliya Saidi, a young lecturer at the American University, was discomfited to be asked about Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld: 'I don't want to say I hate them but they are terrible people.' After an embarrassed pause, she added: 'I don't know if I should say that; my husband is American.'</p> <p>The resentment against the US administration (not the American people who are pre sumed to have been duped) crosses all classes and backgrounds. 'If the US continues to despise the Arab nation in this way,' the owner of a sportswear shop, Hadi Baalbaki, warns, 'I fear the whole Arab nation will form itself into one big al-Qaeda.'</p> <p>Richard Clark, Bush's former anti-terrorism coordinator who took charge in the White House on 9/11 and who retains close contact with intelligence agencies around the world, tells me that 'by almost any measure... the war on terrorism is being lost'. He cites the rate of terrorist atrocities, more than doubled since 9/11, and insists that the number of terrorists has risen to around 100,000 active 'jihadists' around the world. Chillingly, he believes these zealots are likely to be supported 'philosophically, politically, and perhaps with money' by upwards of 700 million Muslims - roughly half the global population of the Islamic faithful.</p> <p>When I was first in Lebanon, some 30 years ago, the young Palestinians in the refugee camps were taught how to use Kalashnikovs. Now, two generations on and still without any escape from their humiliation, they live in an emotional swamp of resentment and anger. Ahmad Iskandar is in his early twenties, edu cated and courteous and speaks as if explaining the self-evident to a backward pupil: 'I am ready to explode myself in Israel.' Ready to be a suicide bomber? 'It is not suicide, sorry. It is a martyr operation.' And what about the innocents who will die? 'Our heart is now dead. They make us forget everything. Just to go and kill them.' And he shrugs his shoulders.</p> <p>Already the poison of al-Qaeda is seeping into the Palestinian camps. Munir Maqhdar, a refugee, is holed up in south Lebanon where he leads a small band of gun-toting guerrillas who swagger around him as he says 'anybody who supports the killing of Arabs and Muslim people in Afghanistan and Iraq is a legitimate target. Any Arab or Muslim organisation is entitled to take revenge if the opportunity arises... the White House has to demonstrate that the historic injustice perpetrated against Palestinians matters every bit as much as the protection of the state of Israel.' According to the UN, 60 million Arabs live on less than two dollars a day, the population is growing rapidly, and unemployment is set to double in five years. The finance director of the Central Bank of Lebanon, Youssef el-Khalil, says that young people have a choice between corruption or fundamentalism. 'Fundamentalism is very much seen as the alternative to corruption... the war on terrorism has to address the war on poverty.'</p> <p>The neocons who hold sway in Washington do not flinch under this kind of fire. For them, in the words of Richard Perle: 'We are winning the war on terrorism. We have killed a significant number. We have put terrorists in many parts of the world on the defensive.'</p> <p>Try telling that to the two doctors I met in Ethiopia, who told me of impoverished young Muslims in the south-east of Ethiopia who 'are being indoctrinated under the coverage of religion with the beliefs and attitudes of al-Qaeda' and who, in some cases, are already in training for future operations. Try telling it to the American diplomat in Addis Ababa who gave me an 'off the record' briefing, holed up in the US compound which, like US embassies around the world, is protected from terrorist attack by armed guards, concrete barriers and razor-wire. He showed me a list of 'wahabi' clerics and business leaders in Ethiopia suspected of allegiance to al-Qaeda and volunteered that US special forces are now operating alongside Ethiopian soldiers in an effort to break up al-Qaeda cells in the Ogaden region. And how were they doing? He shrugged: 'We have already lost the war against terrorism in Africa.'</p> <p>Try telling the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, that 'we' are winning the war on terror. 'Yes,' he confirms (for the first time), US forces are indeed engaged in military operations alongside their Ethiopian counterparts but this 'police work' is only part of the solution - 'the most important part is fighting poverty'. This is not so much an issue of morality but of urgent necessity in a country stricken by familiar but excruciating indices of misery. 'There is a very frustrated population that sees no light at the end of the tunnel and therefore is susceptible to all sorts of saviours, false saviours,' he says.</p> <p>Ethiopia's 70 million population divides its religious affiliations almost equally between the Orthodox Church and Islam. Traditionally this has not been a cause of strife and inter-marriage is commonplace. But you now hear rage against America on the streets of Addis Ababa just as in Baghdad or Beirut. Meles is a member of Tony Blair's Commission for Africa though he has no illusions about its potential to deliver salvation. But in a continent where thousands of children die every day from preventable diseases and where (despite the ravages of HIV) more than 300 million live on less than a dollar a day, you are bound to grasp any outstretched arm and twist it to your advantage.</p> <p>As it is the grotesque distortions of the global market mean that for every dollar the West dispatches to Africa in the form of aid, two dollars are clawed back through subsidies and tariff barriers: a monumental rip-off by the rich as they instruct the poor to accept 'free' trade or else.</p> <p>A growing number of Africans, especially the young (mostly unemployed), use radio, television and the internet to keep themselves disconcertingly well-informed. The hypocrisies and injustices that are inflicted on them drives Meles Zanawi to warn that Africa, no less than the Middle East, could become the source of tomorrow's 9/11. 'Whether it is people in the rural areas of Ethiopia or the centre of Manhattan, we are in the same boat,' he comments, echoing outgoing European commissioner Chris Patten, who says, 'sometimes people are very angry, when they think that fairness is denied them until the crack of doom'.</p> <p>The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, tells me 'it is not that someone who is poor immediately becomes a terrorist... but what are the children going to do, young people with similar values to our own, can't get a job and are frustrated in everything they try to do?'</p> <p>As it is, the West can't even find the resolve to meet its UN 'Millennium Goals' - to reduce world poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. According to Wolfensohn and Gordon Brown, this target date, at the present rate of progress, will be overshot by more than 100 years. There is no excuse: as the Chancellor tells me in great frustration, 'What is lacking is the political will'.</p> <p>It can be done. If every Western nation were to contribute 0.7 per cent of GDP to overseas aid, write off the debt of poorest countries, and eliminate agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, they could find in the order of $785 billion dollars annually for development aid - more than 12 times the present commitment.</p> <p>Which takes us - or should take us - from global poverty to global warming. It is the greatest challenge facing humanity, to combat both at once - to deliver justice, fairness and prosperity to the poor without destroying the planet in the process. Already we are consuming the Earth's natural but finite resources faster than they can be replenished. Already Britain's chief scientific advisor, Sir David King, tells us global warming is a greater threat than global terrorism.</p> <p>So what happens when the poor have their just deserts? Will we see the melting of the ice-caps, catastrophic floods that drown hundreds of thousands of people and turn millions into refugees and famished migrants? Will we all perish in some Siberian or Saharan Armageddon? Or find ourselves caught in a Malthusian end-game as we perish for lack of food and water? Or will we start to control our profligate use of carbon fuels and persuade whoever wins the American election that the resources of the planet must be more equitably shared?</p> <p>As with winning the war on poverty, so with global warming: it is a matter of political will. Which is why a deeply frustrated president of the World Bank says: 'If someone came here from Mars and looked at the way we run the place, he'd get back in his spaceship and go back to Mars and say, \"You don't have to worry about them, they are going to destroy themselves\".' Which means, as I argue in The New World War , we had better get serious about global terrorism, global poverty, and global warming.

  "Terrorism is the use of force or the threat of force to make people - whether individuals or states - behave in a certain way. It depends on fear. And it often, though not always, works. Last week Osama bin Laden told the American people and their elected leaders that, if they did not behave in a certain way, serious consequences, involving massive loss of life and property, would follow. Given that, in almost the same breath, bin Laden claimed responsibility for 11 September, his threats, despite the massive efforts to ensure America's security in the past three years, are credible. <p>Bin Laden's capacity to launch terror strikes is now limited, but he will be pleased with the impact he has made. His project has always been to radicalise those who have hitherto shunned his fanatical message. In this he is little different from any other revolutionary political activist. Yet, through the use of modern media, bin Laden now has the sort of global influence achieved by only some states and a few world figures.</p> <p>Early indications are, thankfully, that his impact on the US electorate has been limited. Both President George W Bush and his challenger, Senator John Kerry, have resisted the temptation to score partisan points in one of the most hotly contested elections in memory. However, victory depends on a few voters in a few key states. It is too early to discount the possibility that bin Laden's intervention could make a major, indeed historic, difference, something that would be hugely damaging for democracy everywhere.</p> <p>There are many flaws in American democracy: the electoral college system dilutes the popular vote; armies of corporate lobbyists contribute to a colossal campaign cost; the legal process to decide any contested poll is unsavoury and unsatisfactory, and a spectre of electoral corruption hangs over the poll. None the less, it is hard not to admire the sheer verve of US politics. The huge crowds at rallies are not seen at political events in Britain. Voter turnout may be low, (traditionally about half of those eligible) but this time voter registration is up dramatically, and citizens across the country are engaged in this election to a degree we should envy. An incredible 63 million people watched, at home or in bars or at 'debate parties', the first of the televised contests between the candidates.</p> <p>Such engagement, embodying the liberal democratic principles on which America is based, is an example to the world. If a mass murderer holed up in a cave in southwest Asia can sway any election, let alone that of America, we will all be losers. We will be double losers if Bush profits from this 'October Surprise'. The American system has always represented a noble aspiration. Recently, those ideals have sometimes seemed distant.</p> <p>Bush has seen the rest of the world as a threat, not as a source of help and goodwill. A series of unforced errors has made Iraq a far tougher problem than it ever needed to be. At home Bush has torn up initiatives that might tackle global warming. He is the first President since Hoover to preside over a net loss in American jobs and the looming deficit, perhaps as high as $4.5 trillion, threatens global repercussions. The influence of the Christian Right, on issues such as stem cell research, gay marriage and abortion, is profoundly worrying. Finally, the current administration bears responsibility for the human rights abuses of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. Bush benefits from an insular society's natural fear after a savagely attack. But this is a negative way to earn votes and offers little reassurance of a change of tone in a re-elected administration.</p> <p>We believe Kerry would do better, particularly when it comes to building the global alliances against terrorism and other threats that are so essential. There may not be much to choose between these two millionaires and Kerry may at times be indecisive and uncharismatic, but the senator's sympathies are positive and thoughtful, his style more humane and he offers a vision of a safer, better world.</p> <p>After more than 200 years, the US system remains the best version of running a society yet devised. We hope there will be a clear winner on Tuesday who is able to reconcile the red and blue states and we hope men like bin Laden will have had no part in choosing him.</p>",
  "<p>There's a Marianne Faithfull song, written by Jarvis Cocker, that reminds me of Bill Nighy; it's called 'Sliding Through Life On Charm'. Nighy is a remarkably charming man, so effortlessly charismatic that, even though you know he worked hard to get where he is today, you can't quite believe he ever lifted an eyebrow, let alone a finger. He manages to make everything - acting, living, both together - seem so easy and amusing. </p> <p>But then, he is a brilliant actor: really, his long legs have been paddling away like mad for years, underpinning that smooth glide, those unruffled feathers, keeping him afloat. </p> <p>He's admitted to crippling self-consciousness and nerves, and though he tells me, 'I am a world-class procrastinator. I'm only an actor because I've been putting off being a writer for 35 years,' he procrastinates by being manically active, rather than vegging out and staring at the telly.</p> <p>As a youth, he kept running off, to Persia and Paris; as a young actor, he toured around the country and developed a raging booze problem; as a theatre luvvie, he worked constantly at the National; as a suddenly popular screen name, he doesn't seem to have paused for breath. In the past four years you could have caught Nighy in nine movies, including I Capture the Castle, Underworld, Shaun of the Dead, and Love Actually, and eight TV roles, from The Canterbury Tales to State of Play. And he's made more - he's just back from filming a BBC drama with Miranda Richardson, directed by Steven Poliakoff - but they're not out yet.</p> <p>Of his recent roles, the two most feted are his world-weary news paper editor Cameron Foster, in State of Play, and raddled rocker Billy Mack, in Love Actually. Not that they are better than any of his other performances (he is amazingly consistent): the first got press attention because it was in an excellent series that portrayed journalists as having more morals than politicians (us hacks love that one), and the second stood out, I think, because, along with Emma Thompson, Nighy saved the Richard Curtis smug-fest from complete insufferability. </p> <p>Anyway, they shoved him on to the national radar; now, people come up in the street and tell him he's lovely. 'It's very, very nice,' he offers, lounging in a chair in the penthouse suite at St Martin's Hotel; legs out, back curved, relaxed, yet active, like a stretched-out spring. 'Blokes call me \"top man\", and people smile when they see me, perhaps because I've played a sad old rocker - twice now - and it's a new character, because we never had old rockers before, and people are affectionate about them, because they're comic and they're still standing. Like me.' He's uncomfortable talking about his popularity: 'I speculate to be sociable, but it's a very big deal for me that any work I do should be well received. As for how people generally perceive me, I don't know.' He puts his specs on, then takes them off.</p> <p>In Nighy's 30-plus-year career (he's 54) he's never had a bad review - 'Not a really terrible one, no. God, that makes me nervous' - and he's not about to get one for his latest film offering, Enduring Love, directed by Roger Notting Hill Michell, from the Ian McEwan novel. The film stars Daniel Craig, Samantha Morton and Rhys Ifans, with Nighy and Susan Lynch providing the warm counterpart to the central madness. </p> <p>Essentially, they represent straightforward, stable, ordinary love as opposed to obsession or lust, or does-not-compute detachment. Nighy enjoyed that: 'It was refreshing to play somebody who's uncomplicatedly OK. It's not often I get to play those kinds of parts.' </p> <p>In fact, he says, because he has played 'so many bullshitters, I'm used to trying to sell things as a lie. I have a criminal mentality, from an actorly point of view. Roger had to pull me up and say: \"Why don't you try doing it honestly?\"'</p> <p>Nighy likes being directed: 'There was a time when you were supposed to question everything the director said, to create some kind of conflict, out of which creativity would be born. But I love it when they tell you what to do, you know: \"Start there, walk over there, say the line and I'll shout: Cut!\" I think it's groovy. When we were filming with Steven Poliakoff, his first note to me - he prefaced it with: \"That was marvellous\", which is always a good start - anyway, his note was: \"Don't wiggle your eyes about so much,\" and you know, my heart leapt. Because I know that. I know how to not make my eyes wiggle about.'</p> <p>There he goes again, making it all sound easy. In fact, Nighy is much more tightly wound than his nonchalance would suggest; he's obsessed with details, anally retentive. You can tell by the way he dresses: which is beautifully. When I say to him, I'd like to talk to you about your clothes, he almost whoops with joy, and we spend a good 20 minutes on suits, including which buttons to do up on your jacket: 'Middle: always. Top: sometimes. Bottom: never. Younger men do this unbearable thing where they do all three buttons up, and you just want to kill them.'</p> <p>Recently, for work, Nighy had a suit made at Alfred Dunhill, and he had long conversations with Martin, the tailor. Martin put him straight on a few things. Nighy has always liked a pleat in his trouser front - 'I feel I'm too long around for the flat-fronted trouser' - but he wanted to team this with a single-vented jacket, and Martin got upset. 'I said: \"Well, are we breaking any laws?\" And he said: \"No, but you're breaking my heart.\"' </p> <p>They spent hours in discussion: two-button jacket with pleated trouser (never); the problem of the double vent (makes your bottom look big). Nighy loved it: 'If you'd told me when I was a kid that I would be having that conversation, I'd have arranged to be more cheerful throughout my life.' When he was young, Nighy was a Mod - 'Ravel loafers, Madras jacket, Fred Perry, John Smedley'; he still buys a midnight-blue Smedley V-neck every year - and he spent his first wages, when he was a teenage messenger boy for The Field magazine, on pastel-coloured mohair jumpers from William Bill. So it must feel weird that he's constantly cast as these ridiculous old Seventies types, all hair and spangles and terrible trousers. 'Oh God, when I did Still Crazy! They put me in trousers that didn't meet my top! Never in my life ... You think: If this isn't funny, I will kill myself.'</p> <p>Of course it was funny: award-winningly funny, in fact - earning him the 1998 Peter Sellers Award for Comedy Performance. Nighy is hilarious. Even when he plays sad or evil characters, there's a wicked humour behind them, a knowing glint that makes you giggle. He's quite obsessive about that, as well: 'If you're in a play and you have the same jokes to deliver, eight times a week, it's endlessly fascinating, just trying to hit it each time, and maybe a little bit quicker, a little bit later, trying to feel the air in which you're about to place it. To have 400 people laugh at the same time, you would go to your grave trying to get it right. And it's also very glamorous when it's on film, because you're not there. I love it when a producer phones up and says: \"It played very well in France. They were laughing.\" In France.'</p> <p>Anyhow, I think he gets cast as old rockers because, despite his lean, mean Mod roots, there is something of the wild thing in Nighy. He loves music, especially rhythm and blues, especially The Rolling Stones, and has been told by his agent to stop playing air guitar in photo sessions because he does it so often. One of his recent highlights was singing with Radiohead at a charity do. They did 'Nobody Does It Better': 'And we brought the house down!' he yelps. </p> <p>The other factor that is very ex-rock star about Nighy is his previous drink-and-drug abuse. When he had just started working in the theatre, in the Seventies, and was itch hiking to Newcastle to paint a set, or to Liverpool to act at the Everyman, his old friends from his home town, Caterham, would try and talk him out of it. 'We used to expand our consciousness on a regular basis, and they'd sit me down and go: \"Bill, man, you've got to stop this shit, 'cause these middle-class fuck-pigs, these straights will fuck you up.\" And I'd say: \"Boys, I've got to make a living,\" and they'd say: \"We can make money, sell some hash, you know. Bill, you want to talk about theatre? The Stones is theatre, man. You want acting? Walking through customs with a couple of kilos - that's acting.\"'</p> <p>After a few more years of chemical experimentation and alcohol certainty, Nighy found himself with a problem. He's been clean for 12 years now and hates talking about 'my drink-and-drugs hell', but offers: 'It's exhausting if you discover that you have a taste for things mood altering. I don't think you have to have a particular desire - I think you're built one way or you're built the other, and I'm built that way. I don't smoke now, which is marvellous. My only addictions are caffeine and sugar.'</p> <p>That's not so bad.</p> <p>'Yes, but with me, it all ends up ... I can't have any breaks from it, I can get fucked up on anything you've got, really. I used to drink 18 cans of Diet Coca-Cola on a daily basis - people would just hand it to me when I walked on set, it was embarrassing. I managed to give that up, so now it's caffeine, I suppose.' Despite this, he orders a pot of coffee, and pours it the minute it turns up. </p> <p>Bill Nighy grew up in Caterham, Surrey, in a house that came with a garage - a real garage, where his dad was works manager. The petrol pumps were outside the family's front door. Nighy remembers sitting on the step, looking at the cars coming in and out. 'My earliest memories involve Swarfega,' he says, 'and Marmite sandwiches, because I used to serve Mass at school twice a week, which meant you had to fast overnight, so that your body was available for the body of Christ. And after you'd served, you didn't have to work in your first lesson, and you could sit there, in class, in front of everyone else, having a cup of tea and a Marmite sandwich.' The rewards of performance.</p> <p>He's not a practising Catholic any more. 'Not since I started combing my hair and worrying about my trousers. About 14, 15.' It was around that time that his dad let him paint his room any colour he wanted: Nighy chose red on one wall, purple on another and a lime green on a third - 'a disastrous first design decision'. No posters, except one of Celia Hammond on the inside of his wardrobe. It sounds like a room to make you go mad, I suggest, but actually he just used to read. There weren't many books in his home - the collected works of Dickens that his dad had won from the Daily Express, and a glossary of the world - but Nighy used to buy his own from second-hand shops: Fitzgerald, Joyce, Hemingway. He decided to become a writer, and ran away, with another boy, just before his O-levels, to Persia, to start. They got as far as the south of France, before having to appeal to the British Council to send them back, because they were starving. It cost \u00a325, and he spent years paying his dad back. </p> <p>Later, when Nighy was offered an opportunity to become a sub-editor for The Field, as opposed to just delivering it, he refused, because he was going to Paris with his friends Brandon and Jamie Jenning, to write the Great British Novel. The first night they were there, they slept underneath the Arc de Triomphe. They were surprised to see the traffic when they woke up. And no, of course, they didn't write anything. He still hasn't. </p> <p>Which is lucky for us, as he's been filling all that writing time with acting, which he's good at, though it took him years to realise it: 'I kept expecting to be arrested for impersonating an actor.' He only joined Guildford Drama School to impress a girl, and he only kept on with it because people kept trying to put him off. 'You know, there may be periods when you're unemployed. Great. You'll never know what will happen from one minute to the next. Yeah, fabulous. You don't know what money you're going to be making in 25 years' time. Yeah, baby! It's like being a gambler, and when I was 18, that was music.'</p> <p>But acting, in the end, expanded to fill his whole life: he met his long-term partner, actress Diana Quick, through work 23 years ago, and they have a daughter, Mary, who's apparently making tentative dramatic steps too. Plus, like many natural addicts - it takes a lot of dedicated effort to maintain a habit - it turns out he has a vast capacity for work. And he does love his job. It satisfies so many of his obsessions: the words, the clothes ... 'I even wear a suit for improvisation workshops, rolling around. Well, acting's a white-collar job, you know? You wear a suit.'</p> <p>It's time for Nighy to leave, and as he does, dashingly, charmingly (kissing me on the cheek, remembering himself to my brother), he comments on the suite decor, which is modern and spare but accessorised strangely, with pashminas on the couch and a ridiculous carved wooden table. It sparks something in him. 'I hate design which has nothing to do with function. When I first went to work and had digs, I would arrange that there was nothing in my room, just a bed and a chair. It was like a cell. And I once saw this thing on the telly where there were these two guys who lived in a minimalist house. Absolutely nothing in it, but they had a deal that if they left their shoes on the stairs in an interesting shape, and they both agreed, they could leave them there. I understand that.' Your house must be tidy.</p> <p>'Oh no, it's normal, because I live with normal human beings, and two dogs. And I don't do anything useful, like clean.'</p> <p>Nighy pauses - he's a bit embarrassed, </p> <p>I think - and then he says, all in a rush:</p> <p>'There's a bit in Performance, one of my favourite films - with James Fox giving one of my favourite performances - and there's a scene where he's getting ready, and there's a bit where he arranges his Playboy lighter, and the magazines, and the ashtray, perfectly symmetrically aligned on the coffee table, the funky coffee table. And then he gets his tie and his shirt absolutely fabulous, and the hair is right - and I love it with all my heart, and I love the whole movie, and I love him in it...</p> <p>'And then, he looks in the mirror and says: \"I am a bullet.\" And,' says Nighy, 'my heart goes boom.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Enduring Love is out on 26 November</p>",
  "<p>War in Iraq; unemployment in the rust-belt; hanging chads - American voters may have any number of issues uppermost in their minds as they cast their votes this week, but the value of the dollar in their pockets is unlikely to be among them. However, the mighty greenback, for many years the symbol of America's global economic hegemony, is wobbling, and the outcome of this bitterly contested election could help determine how far, and how fast, it falls. </p> <p>With a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent of GDP, and growth prospects under threat from $50-a-barrel oil, rising interest rates and an overstretched consumer sector, experts have little doubt that the greenback is overvalued. In fact, the correction has already begun: the dollar hit an eight-month low against the euro and a six-month low against the yen last week, after a respite over the summer. The presidential election could be just the catalyst the markets have been waiting for to spark a more sustained readjustment. </p> <p>'People are bearish because of the scale of the imbalances in the economy. Historically, current account deficits of this kind have been associated with pretty major currency reversals,' says Richard Iley of BNP Paribas. </p> <p>'There is no question, the dollar is definitely going down,' says Adrian Foster, head of currency at Dresdner. </p> <p>In the very short run, what investors would most like is a clean result next week. The dollar usually bounces immediately after presidential elections, but in 2000, it fell 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis between November and the end of the year, as Bush and Gore wrangled over 'hanging chads' and recounts. </p> <p>With teams of lawyers standing by for both camps this time, and little to choose between them in the polls, another pro tracted tussle - and another anxious month for the markets - looks likely. </p> <p>Once a victor is eventually declared, though, analysts believe a win for John Kerry could cause a short sharp shock for the greenback, while the familiar face of George W in the oval office might postpone the inevitable for a while. </p> <p>Ironically, one reason Kerry's arrival in the White House could be bearish for the dollar is that he would be more likely to try to get to grips with the $400 billion budget deficit that is Bush Jr's legacy. 'When you're a new guy in office, it's good to get your dirty work out of the way early, in terms of cutting spending, slowing the economy down,' says Steve Andrew, chief economist at F&amp;C. That could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more slowly, and put downward pressure on the dollar. </p> <p>'Kerry is broadly dollar-negative,' agrees Bill O'Neill, global strategist at JP Morgan. 'It's akin to the environment after the Reagan period, where you had fiscal consolidation and an easy Fed policy. That coincided with a soft dollar.' </p> <p>After capital controls were abolished in 1973, and the dollar was first allowed to float freely, it climbed during Gerald Ford's Republican presidency, from 1974 to 1977, and slid under Democrat Jimmy Carter, between 1977 and 1981. In the 1980s, 'Reaganomics' threw conventional left-right logic into disarray. </p> <p>Reagan initially presided over a great spike in the dollar's value, as he cut taxes and plunged into the red to pump up economic expansion. He was then persuaded that it had become too strong for the good of the US and the global economy; and in the era when currency fluctuations were a matter for international diplomacy, the G7 group of rich nations agreed to orchestrate an orderly depreciation, in what became known as the Plaza agreement of 1985. Two years later, in the so-called Louvre accord, they decided it was time to put a floor under the market. </p> <p>Under Clinton, particularly in his second term, as the fervour that underpinned the dotcom boom sparked talk of a 'new paradigm' and a 'productivity miracle', having a strong dollar became a matter of macho economic pride. </p> <p>Since the economy slid into reverse after the stock market bubble burst, the dollar has suffered, falling by about 7 per cent against other currencies on the Federal Reserve's broad index since Bush Jr's inauguration in January 2001. But analysts fear that by digging into the public coffers to reflate the economy and pull out of the dotcom downturn, Bush has stored up problems for the future. </p> <p>Both candidates have pledged to halve the huge fiscal deficit during their first term, but Kerry is seen by the markets as more committed to this goal. He has put considerable emphasis on keeping spending under control, and clearing the fiscal mess left by Bush. </p> <p>Judging by his rhetoric during the campaign, Kerry could be more protectionist, perhaps raising the pressure on the Chinese government to float its currency, the renminbi, and allow the dollar to fall against it. Much of the US's vast trade deficit is with Asia, as American consumers suck in billions of dol lars worth of cheap imports from China and Japan. US governments have argued for some time that the Chinese are gaining an unfair advantage by keeping their currency pegged to the dollar at a cheap rate. Last week's surprise move by the Chinese to push up interest rates in an attempt to guide their booming economy towards a soft landing raised hopes in the markets that their next step might be to allow the renminbi to appreciate. </p> <p>That would be a relief for the eurozone, which has so far been the main release valve for downward pressure on the dollar. In recent weeks, eurozone ministers have repeatedly suggested that they are unfazed by the idea of a strong euro, but its appreciation against the dollar is threatening to derail the fragile export-led recovery. </p> <p>The attitude of the Japanese government is also crucial: it has repeatedly propped up the dollar against the yen, and could begin doing so again once the election is out of the way. As a result, G7 meetings have once again become the forum for heated discussion about currencies. 'The G7 meetings have become a lot more important than they were: these are the most important issues facing the global economy,' says Iley. </p> <p>However, analysts fear that even if Japan continues to intervene, its strategy may not be sustainable for long. 'Not even huge intervention can stop the dollar defying gravity in our view,' said currency experts at Bear Stearns in a research note last week. 'The economics of the dollar are still poor.' </p> <p>Abandoning the long-cherished mantra of a 'strong dollar policy' would be read as a dramatic change, even if the policy means little in practice these days. But there is a growing consensus that the US cannot keep spending more than it earns, and importing more than it exports, at such an extraordinary pace. 'It's not in either candidate's best interest to actively encourage a stronger dollar right now,' says Foster. </p> <p>The adjustment may take longer to arrive if George W is in charge, but it can't be avoided for ever.</p>",
  "They are quintessentially English; the picture that adorns a million chocolate boxes. But the quaint tradition of thatched roofs on country cottages is under threat from the European Commission. <p>There are 50,000 thatched cottages in England and more in Wales and Scotland, many of which have survived centuries of exposure to the elements thanks to their long-straw wheat roofs. </p> <p>In recent years short varieties of wheat, which yield better grain crops, have increasingly replaced the long-straw type. These modern wheats need nitrogen and other chemicals to help them grow and stay pest-free, which also makes them bad for thatching because they rot more easily. </p> <p>Experts estimate that fewer than one in five thatched roofs is now being replaced with straw. The rest are being covered mainly by water reed - often imported from eastern Europe or China - or triticale, a modern cross between rye and wheat. </p> <p>This problem is exacerbated by local authorities not insisting on like-for-like replacements when roofs are rebuilt, critics claim. </p> <p>Attempts to save Britain's traditional thatched roofs are being thwarted because European rules ban farmers from buying or even being given the old long-straw organic wheat seeds they need to start growing traditional thatching straw. </p> <p>Some fear the old roofs could soon be all but lost, as they have been in mainland Europe. 'I'm quite pessimistic,' said Jack Lewis, a recently retired thatcher. 'It's a steady drip, drip, and after a while it might tip over.' </p> <p>Originally, all thatching in Western Europe was done with straw except pockets in areas where water reed grew, such as Norfolk. Up until 100 years ago, dozens of varieties of wheat were grown 'to meet this demand. </p> <p>Now there are just two varieties approved by the European Commission and British government which are close to long enough for thatching - and even they are 'second best', said Lewis. </p> <p>The list dwindled because not enough was done to keep farmers growing longer varieties for thatching, so there was not sufficient demand; but some critics claim seed companies now have a vested interest in preventing them being relisted because they would not profit from royalties for such ancient strains. </p> <p>John Letts, an Oxford-based archaeobotanist, now believes that at least 60 per cent of roofs are replaced with water reed and 30 per cent with triticale. </p> <p>'It's a huge threat,' said Letts. 'Not having access to the older varieties is really helping people to shift to the water reed and triticale.' </p> <p>Most people would not notice the difference, but traditionalists say that the new materials often don't last as long and are destroying the natural richness and diversity of the old roofs. </p> <p>'You could say that about so many historical buildings - 99 per cent of the population won't see it - but you're cutting out the history frankly,' said Chris Wood, a senior architectural conservator with English Heritage. </p> <p>Lewis and others are pressing the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to allow old wheat varieties to be grown again, which they say would also help struggling farmers who want to diversify. </p> <p>Others believe that the planners need to be stricter about insisting on traditional materials - with the government's lead. 'We think demand will lead supply,' Matthew Slocombe, deputy secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, said.</p>",
  "<p>Much of the most interesting, most urgent film-making of the past couple of years, especially in North America, has been in the documentary field, and the majority of the films are directly or obliquely political. They're a reaction, in part at least, against the false balance and censorship of TV, against the blandness of mainstream cinema and the solipsism and social disengagement of small-scale, independent productions. And they appeal to us because we live in a world of spin and image manipulation that makes it increasingly difficult to recognise what is real and authentic.</p> <p>The most striking success this year, of course, has been Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 , winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes and a box-office success the world over. But there's also been My Architect, Capturing the Friedmans, Super Size Me, The Fog of War, The Control Room, and now The Corporation, a long, sharp, polemical work, co-directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott and written by Joel Bakan, all of whom, as Canadians, bring a particular critical perspective to bear upon the United States.</p> <p>Abbott and Achbar are film-makers with a specific interest in the environment, the ecology and globalisation. Bakan is a lawyer and the author of a book on corporations with the blunt subtitle, 'The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power' which announces the film's central thrust. The movie argues that over the past 150 years business corporations have steadily grown to dominate the world, determining lives, overriding governments, depleting the world's resources, polluting the atmosphere. In the United States, lawyers, who are a form of corporate heavy artillery, took the Four teenth Amendment of the Constitution, originally designed to protect free slaves, and used it to have corporations attain the legal status of persons. But they are persons designed, and legally compelled, to pursue profit without concern for the human consequences. </p> <p>The film is hard-hitting but not hectoring, and among the 40-odd witnesses are eloquent spokesmen for capitalism, among them the gnome-like Milton Friedman, Lady Thatcher's favourite economist and the most right-wing person ever to win a Nobel Prize, and the likeable Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, former chairman of Shell. Sir Mark's home (as shown in some TV footage) was besieged by ecological commandos, who ended up being entertained to a picnic-cum-seminar on the family lawn. </p> <p>The movie and most of its contributors make a distinction between the people who run organisations and the institutions themselves. The most striking person in the film, a hero of sorts, is Ray Anderson, the CEO of Interface, the largest carpet manufacturer, who has been converted to the cause of sustainability and has made this the test of all his company's activities. But in one of the most amusing of the film's dozen chapters, the corporation itself as an entity is subjected to a psychiatric examination and diagnosed as a classic psychopath.</p> <p>One of the chapters, 'The Price of Whistleblowing', initially seems to be something of a diversion from the movie's main theme. It examines the case of two investigative journalists, Jane Akre and Steve Wilson, hired by Fox News, Rupert Murdoch's TV channel, and then put through legal hell when they made a programme exposing a synthetic hormone marketed by Monsanto to boost milk production. They highlighted the potential health risk of the product, to both cows and milk drinkers. But after threats from Monsanto's lawyers, Fox itself pursued the journalists, although a jury was persuaded that their claims had been true. This incident not only exposes the way in which conglomerates work together to protect their mutual interests, but also explains why Achbar, Abbott and Bakan don't work for the likes of Murdoch.</p> <p>This is a movie to see, ponder and discuss. It's disturbing but, ultimately, not despairing. It points to ways in which people can fight back. Just to hear an American corporate adviser say that the ultimate goal of capitalism is to have someone (preferably a corporation) own every square inch of the globe makes the blood boil and encourages one to seek some kind of action. </p> <p>A major question raised is why so many people now believe that anything privately run for profit is preferable to anything publicly run for the general good. The members of our corporation-loving government would be healthier for exposing both their minds and consciences to this film.</p>"
