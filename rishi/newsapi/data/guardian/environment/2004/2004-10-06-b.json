  "<p>\"Old Trafford might be the Theatre of Dreams but that perennial bid story has finally become a reality. Well, almost,\" said the <strong>Independent</strong>'s Jeremy Warner, after Manchester United confirmed it had been approached by an unnamed potential bidder. </p> <p>Despite the cloak of anonymity, no one appeared to doubt Malcolm Glazer was the mystery bidder. The 76-year-old US businessman - who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team - had been stalking United for more than a year. He recently increased his stake in the club to more than 19%. </p> <p>Neil Collins, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, wondered why anyone would buy a football club. \"The pleasures of winning are fleeting, the criticism from the fans relentless and the opportunities for making a decent return on the investment close to non-existent,\" he said. </p> <p>But the <strong>Wall Street Journal Europe</strong>'s Breaking Views column felt it was time someone made a bid for United. \"For more than 18 months now, a motley crew of rich men have been quietly building big stakes in [the club],\" it said. JP McManus and John Magnier, for example, own almost 29% of the shares. The Irish horseracing tycoons will be \"pivotal\" in any bid, said the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>. \"Analysts reckoned that they will sell if Mr Glazer offers more than \u00a33 a share.\" </p> <p>United's share price jumped more than 5% on Monday, raising the value of the club to \u00a3675m. The price eased 0.55% to 269.5p by the end of Tuesday. Mr Glazer would have to offer between \u00a3700m and \u00a3800m to capture the club, agreed the papers. </p> <p>But if the US businessman is in \"the driving seat, he had better make peace with the fans as soon as he can - even ... Rupert Murdoch found them a handful\", said Stephen Khan in the <strong> Daily Express</strong>, noting the media mogul's failed \u00a3624m bid in 1999. \"It would not do the image of Manchester United as a world brand any favours\" if there were regular matchday demonstrations, he added. </p> <p>Protests were a strong possibility, said the <strong>Manchester Evening News</strong>. \"The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association has warned that 'direct action' will form part of the strategy aimed at preventing the American multi-millionaire from gaining control of the club,\" said the paper. </p> <p>But because of stock exchange rules, the fans can do little to prevent the takeover, explained the Daily Mail. Mr Glazer only needs 50% of United plc plus one share to succeed, and \"UK listing rules allow [him] to cancel shares anyway.\" </p> <p>\"This time [the fans] are unlikely to be helped by the Monopolies Commission,\" said the Independent. The supporters have a right to question whether Mr Glazer is right for United, it added, but \"it is naive of them to reject commercialisation.\" </p> <p>Martin Samuel, in the <strong>Times</strong>, agreed. \"Memo to Manchester United fans: welcome to the free market,\" he wrote. \"No sporting organisation in Britain has so ruthlessly exploited market forces as Manchester United plc. Laissez-faire capitalism has brought them the biggest ground, the most expensive players, a global fanbase and a commercial arm second to none. It made the club the most dominant force and loudest voice in English football,\" but now leaves it vulnerable to takeover, said Samuel. </p> <p>But the Wall Street Journal Europe warned yesterday that Mr Glazer should not ignore the fans. \"Even if only 8% of shareholders vote against the bid, he wouldn't be able to squeeze them out,\" it noted. \"He would be stuck with disgruntled minority. What's more, Manchester United depends on its fans for revenue. Without their purchasing power the soccer club would not be as profitable as it is.\" </p> <p>Mr Glazer still has to woo Mr McManus and Mr Magnier, it continued. \"If Mr Glazer has to pay up to get this speculative pair on board, it might be enough to sway even the greed of the most ardent Manchester United fan.\" </p> <p>But who would be the beneficiaries of the latest takeover speculation? \"The smart money in this soap opera\" is on Mr McManus and Mr Magnier, \"who have outmanoeuvred everyone, and now they seem poised to collect their winnings\", concluded Collins in the Telegraph.</p>",
  "<p>The Environment Agency has launched an <a href=\"http://environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood/826674/\">interactive map</a> that tells you how much your home is at risk from flooding. Or as the Express put it on Tuesday, a \"secret map that could slash the value of your home\".</p>",
  "The European commission warned Turkey yesterday that it would break off entry negotiations if EU ministers found evidence of a \"serious and persistent\" breach of democratic and human rights. <p>The commission effectively gave Turkey the amber light for the start of accession talks, probably in the first half of next year, but only after expressing profound misgivings about violations of freedom. </p> <p>The 30 commissioners from 25 countries agreed to negotiations which could last until as late as 2019. To assuage some members openly hostile to Turkish membership, the commissioners said talks could be suspended by a qualified majority within the council of ministers. The commission offered no guarantee to Turkey that entry was assured. </p> <p>\"There was no vote and [no] unanimity, but there was a consensus,\" one EU source said. EU officials brushed aside suggestions that a proposal to insert a permanent safeguard clause, curbing economic migration to other EU countries, meant that the mainly Muslim country was being offered second-class membership. </p> <p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, said in Strasbourg that he was confident EU leaders would agree at their December summit formally to open talks early next year. But he demanded the same rules as other candidates, and criticised the offer's conditional nature: \"If negotiations are suspended this would show a lack of respect for Turkey's democratisation process and would conflict with the EU's own principles.\" </p> <p>He lambasted the French president, Jacques Chirac, for promising a referendum on membership amid growing fears in Brussels that other countries would follow suit, effectively vetoing entry. </p> <p>In contrast to France, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, who arrives for talks in Ankara today, said Turkey had undergone remarkable changes: \"The EU must now deliver its side of the bargain.\" </p> <p>Ankara's moderate Islamic government has staked all on EU membership for the impoverished country of 70 million. The foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, played down suggestions talks could be disrupted. </p> <p>\"Theoretically, there is such a possibility; but I believe it is impossible that something like that could happen,\" he said. </p> <p>The commission hopes the process of entry negotiations will buttress reform in Turkey and produce a positive outcome in any popular votes. With opposition growing in France and Germany to Turkey's candidacy, Romano Prodi, the outgoing commission president, spoke of the need to allay public fears that membership would radically alter the EU and flood it with immigrant labour. One diplomat favouring entry said: \"Safeguards on migration are simply throwing a bone to the Islamophobes which don't add up to anything; but if that's the price for agreeing to entry talks, it's worth paying ... It's just an insurance policy designed not to be used.\" </p> <p>Mr Prodi also warned Turkey \"much remains to be done\" in making good legislative promises to guarantee democratic and human rights despite \"clearly visible pro gress\", and pointed to \"still some blurred areas\". </p> <p>His aides said that, for the first time, a candidate would be judged on enacted reforms that prove irreversible, not just policy or legislation. </p> <p>A political assessment of how far Turkey had gone to meet the political entry criteria said it needed to consolidate and broaden reforms, especially \"zero tolerance policy in the fight against torture and ill-treatment\", measures to guarantee freedom of expression and religion, and rights of women, unions and minorities, especially the Kurds. </p> <p>G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the enlargement commissioner, told MEPs there were individual cases of infringement and abuse but the government \"does seem to be doing what it can to stop this practice\". The commission found no evidence of systematic torture and said some perpetrators had been punished, but called for further efforts. </p> <p>Hans-Gert Poettering, the leader of the conservative European People's party and a Christian Democrat, said this was \"the biggest nonsense of 2004\" and ignored the reality in Turkey's jails. Entry would fundamentally alter the EU, he warned; there were, he said, three not two options available: membership, non-membership, and \"privileged partnership\". </p> <p>Mr Prodi said Turkey could make a positive contribution but its sheer size and make-up, including its economy, called for \"clear precautions\" to \"prevent Turkey's integration from weakening the structure we have been building for more than 50 years\". </p> <p>The assessment lowered estimates of cost to the EU budget, previously put at up to \u20ac28bn (\u00a319.4bn) a year. </p> <p>The Turkish media was generally upbeat at the outcome. Commentators said it would help democratise the country, in turn weakening the role of the military. </p> <p>\"The harsh conditions are in my opinion a safety valve to dilute the reaction of those countries, like France, that are negative to Turkey's EU accession. Basically for Turkey the report said everything that one would want,\" said a political scientist, Ahmet Evin. </p> <p><b>What's in it for the union?</b></p> <p><b> For</b> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> EU credibility is at stake.

  "<p>The Italian defence group Finmeccanica said yesterday it would have to start laying off workers at the Westland helicopter plant in Yeovil unless the British government finalised a new order by the end of the year. </p> <p>The warning from Finmeccanica's chief executive Pier Francesco Guarguaglini came as Britain gave the green light to the \u00a31bn deal under which the Italian company will acquire the 50% of AgustaWestland which it does not already own. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Guarguaglini said without the order for next generation Lynx helicopters the Westland plant, which employs more than 4,000, would face a shortfall in its work load. </p> <p>The new Lynx contract is expected to be for about \u00a31bn worth of helicopters for the army and navy although Mr Guarguaglini said Westland would not need the go-ahead for the entire order immediately. </p> <p>But if Westland did not get a confirmation of at least part of the contract by the end of the year \"we would have some problems. Clearly some jobs will be in danger.\" He said that about 200 jobs would be involved. </p> <p>His comments came as competition minister Gerry Sutcliffe said he would not refer the Italian company's acquisition of the outstanding 50% of AgustaWestland to the competition commission but would accept Finmeccanica's undertakings that it would \"ensure the protection of classified technology and information and the maintenance of a UK military helicopter technology\". </p> <p>The Finmeccanica chief executive was in upbeat mood about the prospects for the second tranche of Eurofighters. He said he expected the French, British, Italian and German governments to sign an agreement to buy another 236 fighters from the manufacturing consortium of BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica subsidiary Alenia. </p> <p>\"I hope the parties will reach agreement within the next few days. The main problem is price.\" </p> <p>He was less forthcoming about the prospects of a third tranche involving a further 236 Eurofighters. He said he did not know if the third tranche would be built.</p>",
  "<p>Sterling's trade-weighted index closed last night at its lowest level for more than eight months - and no wonder. The mood in the City has turned bearish, with a sense that the economy is coming off the boil so quickly that interest rates may well have peaked. </p> <p>This looks like a good call. Imagine that you are a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, concerned about the medium-term outlook for inflation. A couple of months ago everything seemed to be going well. Rates had been pushed up five times, and further increases in November and in February 2005 were in the market. </p> <p>Since the summer, however, there has been little to justify a further tightening. Sure, yesterday's Halifax index showed a 1.4% increase in house prices last month, but the figure was laughed off - rightly so - by the City. Perhaps a more telling indicator of consumer sentiment was that new car sales last month were 2% down against the same month a year ago. </p> <p>Survey evidence - for both manufacturing and services - points to a slowdown in activity over the coming months as dearer borrowing costs and the \"soft spot\" in the global economy affect demand. </p> <p>Some moderation in the rate of growth was foreseen by the Bank of England in its August inflation report, but not this quickly. Moreover, the effects of higher interest rates have yet to have their full impact, since those who took out two-year fixes when rates hit rock bottom in 2003 will only start to feel the pain next year. </p> <p>True, the labour market is tight, and there is a risk that pay bargainers may push for higher wage settlements as compensation for higher petrol prices. </p> <p>But this won't show up this month or next, and in the interim inflation is below its target and growth is at - or even below - trend. </p> <p>As such, the chances of a rate rise this year are now slim. Indeed, the next move could well be down. </p> <p><strong> Google gobbles </strong> </p> <p>Everybody directly involved was doing their damnedest yesterday to play down news that Google is going into the retail book trade. Or rather that it is offering its services as a new electronic interface between book buyers and sellers. </p> <p>Google's typically open-armed style in such matters - in this case promising that publishers and retailers of all shapes and sizes will be welcomed into the new Google Print community - may well be good news for the publish ing industry generally, helping to generate fresh interest in the traditional printed word. Also, few analysts see any substantive impact on Amazon's position as the web's king of books. </p> <p>But somebody, somewhere, will end up paying for Google's listings - and with the intense price competitiveness that the internet brings, the betting is that it will not be the consumer. </p> <p>Established businesses in all sorts of sectors are looking at Google and wondering whether its a friend or a foe. Its position as the effective gateway to the web gives it, in some form or another, the ability to take a tiny clip from every cyber coin spent. </p> <p>During the boom, e-missionaries such as John Chambers of Cisco used to talk about stodgy old companies in each and every commercial sector getting Amazoned. </p> <p>He was only partially right at the time, but the march of technology has given us a similar, albeit more subtle, verb. Google News did it to newspapers, Wall Street got a taste during Google's flotation. Now that publishing has been Googled, it will be interesting to see who is next. </p> <p><strong> Rapture revisited </strong> </p> <p>Try to read the following without scoffing: \"Britain now has a number of beacons of hope in the fight against fraud, reminiscent of New York's success in reversing a supposedly unstoppable wave of law-breaking in the 1990s. Too many people said it couldn't be done. Mayor Giuliani proved it could and now a string of UK initiatives are setting a similar example on economic crime. There's too much unthinking pessimism. There is nothing inevitable about fraud. Insight and initiative can turn the tide.\" </p> <p>This is Ros Wright, the former director of the Serious Fraud Office, speaking in her new guise as chair of the Fraud Advisory Panel, an \"independent watchdog\" funded by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales. </p> <p>The panel is keen, in its annual review published yesterday, to highlight three aspects to \"getting it right\". </p> <p>1) High-level strategic thinking. The response to fraud needs \"a holistic strategy rather than through piecemeal initiatives\". </p> <p>2) Police-business partnerships. \"Much closer cooperation between the police and business is essential. Law enforcement can never do everything by itself.\" </p> <p>3) Cultural change. \"Long-term fraud reduction also depends on informing, training and motivating all employees. Economic crime is too widespread to be tackled only by a few specialists.\" </p> <p>\"Of course fraud is very far from disappearing,\" Mrs Wright added, \"so our rapture is modified. Progress has been made but it needs to be consolidated and built on.\" </p> <p>Our rapture remains non-existent.</p>",
  "<p>It was a thoroughly memorable occasion - on September 14, 300 people gathered to celebrate Horizon's 40th birthday and to launch the new series. For an old-timer like myself, who edited the series for six years in the 1970s, there was pleasure to be had in its long survival, the only programme left from the start of BBC2. There was pleasure too in meeting old colleagues and discussing the series, although what emerged was a widely felt concern. </p> <p>There was a feeling that Horizon was dumbing down, that it had lost its nerve, was terrified of failure and it was using old formats to tell stories that were not real science. Horizon had lost its way. </p> <p>These hefty criticisms were being directed not only at a great survivor, but at a series in apparently rude health. Only two years ago it won both the Bafta and Royal Television Society awards for best factual series. Furthermore, two films had recently won coveted American Emmy awards. </p> <p>The critics in question are not obvious grumblers and I shared many of their misgivings. So why, I asked, is there this dichotomy between the measurable success of the series and the views of us old hands? </p> <p>From the beginning there has been a tug-of-war between Horizon's educational agenda and its need to hold an audience. It was a struggle that was nearly lost within the first two seasons. The first editor, Gordon Rattray Taylor, an accomplished popular science writer, had purist notions. In the narration opening the first programme, a profile of Buckminster Fuller, he made clear that the series would be a \"platform\" for scientists, in effect placing the series producers at their disposal. </p> <p>This is not so bizarre as it might now seem; scientists had to be enticed to appear, and those who did faced some risk to their career. </p> <p>Taylor also had a very particular view of our audience (which at the start was very small). He once opposed a decision to move the series from its 10pm slot to 9pm. His reason - that someone such as the clerk to the House of Commons, in his eyes a typical viewer, would not have finished dinner by 9pm. (As I write this I wonder if I invented it, but no.) </p> <p>The series staggered through those first two years amid constant rumours of extinction. Its survival owes much to Taylor's successor, Bob Reid, and to David Attenborough, who shook it from its elitism and transformed a monthly magazine programme into a weekly single-subject film. </p> <p>By the time I became editor in 1969, there were 36 editions per year (there are some 20 now) and one subject was to transform the profile of the series: the environment dominated for several years. We investigated the pollution of Lake Eerie. We showed the efforts to save Venice while the bureaucrats argued and we showed how whales, whose intelligence was only then being recognised, were being slaughtered for pet food. Such was our taste for Doomsday scenarios, which questioned the role of science and technology, that this paper's esteemed TV critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, dubbed the series the Eeyore of television. </p> <p>It was an exciting time, with firsts to be had everywhere - an episode on the first test-tube baby, the first programme to describe continental drift and the first to look at the Crab Nebula. Later there were memorable films on the arrival of the microchip and on bubble memory - big subjects all. </p> <p>The narrative of these programmes was constructed around a description of the science. There were human stories, yes, but the science was paramount and remained so for two decades. </p> <p>It was then that the fight for ratings began in earnest, with the arrival of Channel 4, deregulation and the cable channels. Horizon, by then edited by Jana Bennett, approached keeping its audience in an interesting way. </p> <p>\"Her mantra was strongly narrative storylines,\" says John Lynch, who as editor and now creative director of science has had a great influence on the series. \"She asked, what is the story that will engage me even if I'm not interested in the subject?\" Instead of the science providing the narrative it would be the human story of the investigation or of a race to make a discovery. </p> <p>When the balance between science and human drama was right, then the results were exceptional. Lynch's own prize-winning film, Fermat's Last Theorem, described as a love story between a man and his equation, achieved that balance. And mixed in a series with other approaches, it is a valid format. </p> <p>But the extent to which it came to be used and to which the science often took a secondary role began to change the feel of Horizon, compounded by its weakness in describing the big ideas. </p> <p>This change was exacerbated by an increasing emphasis on \"hot button\" topics: audience-winners such as palaeontology, volcanos, earthquakes, disasters, cosmology and medicine. </p> <p>When Jane Root took over as BBC2 controller in 1999, and the bid for ratings became more direct, the unit rightly or wrongly felt the very future of the series under threat and moved to producing even more of those topics. Two years ago, nine of the 20 or so films in that year's series were on palaeontology or archaeology, and many used the strong narrative style. </p> <p>At the same time, other terrestrial cable channels moved in to capitalise on the audience appeal of these areas. Horizon's output quickly became indistinguishable from that of other channels. The ratings were good, but it risked losing its identity. </p> <p>So, you might think, here ends a sermon from an old-timer who prefers the way things were done in his day. Except that, since the anniversary party, I realise that the same fears about the series are felt by the present editorial staff. I have also been told about a piece of audience research commissioned by Horizon's new editor, Matthew Barrett, which asked a focus group what they wanted from Horizon. According to Barrett, it was that \"in a confusing world they wanted someone whom they could turn to and trust. That's a tremendously valuable role for us.\" </p> <p>If this finding is followed through, it means a shift in the balance of programmes away from the personal narrative towards exploring and explaining issues and science. \"We all of us started watching Horizon to learn something we didn't know, something new,\" Barrett says. \"And that must remain central to what we do. I think the narrative thing was an immensely valuable tool for us and helped breathe new life into the strand. But it isn't the only way to do things and maybe we went too far down that route.\" </p> <p>The arrival of Roly Keating as channel controller from BBC4 gives the unit real hope that ratings will no longer be the overriding issue. Recent shows, such as those about the threat to the Gulf Stream and dirty bombs, are just two of several recent films that demonstrate Horizon's programme skills in abundance. </p> <p>The new series began with a promising issue-oriented piece on vitamins. All this old-timer can do now is to watch this space and hope.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Richard Branson's budget airline, Virgin Express, seems likely to disappear from the skies in two years' time under the terms of a long-awaited merger with Belgium's SN Brussels. </p> <p>The final deal, announced yesterday, will give Sir Richard a continuing stake of 29%, with an option to sell his shares within three years for \u20ac54m (\u00a337.3m). </p> <p>He has given the merged carrier permission to keep using the Virgin brand name - but only for a period of 24 months from completion. </p> <p>Both airlines are based in Brussels. They have complained of overcapacity in the industry and struggled to cope with competition from Ryanair, which has benefited from a controversial cut-price landing deal at nearby Charleroi airport. </p> <p>Virgin Express has made steep losses and has had to borrow \u20ac27m from Sir Richard's parent company, Virgin Sky Investments. In a statement, it said its short routes to British and mainland European destina tions would be complemented by SN Brussels' longer haul services to America and Africa. </p> <p>Virgin Express's chairman, David Hoare, said: \"I am pleased that Virgin Express will be joining forces with SN Brussels to create the leading Belgian carrier, offering its customers not only a low fare but a full service product to a wide range of destinations.\" </p> <p>SN Brussels emerged from the ashes of Belgium's national carrier, Sabena, which went bust in the aviation industry's global slump following the terrorist attacks of September 11. </p> <p>The merger is intended to generate \u20ac44m of cost savings, although SN's chairman, Etienne Davignon, insisted he did not expect any job losses in the immediate future. </p> <p>Sir Richard's preferred strategy for his airline interests is to merge his long-haul carrier, Virgin Atlantic, with Sir Michael Bishop's BMI - although Sir Michael has consistently refused to discuss such a deal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> BMI is to begin flying from Heathrow to Mumbai and Bangalore in March in its first venture into Asia. It is keen to diversify from the highly competitive European market. Its existing long-haul operation consists of a few transatlantic routes from Manchester.</p>",
  "<p>BP has struck lucky in Russia with a potentially massive new oil and gas find off Sakhalin Island in the far east of the country but the success has alarmed environmentalists. </p> <p>The latest news from Russia came as global oil prices hit a record peak of nearly $52 a barrel fuelled by the impact of Hurricane Ivan on American crude inventories. </p> <p>The first well drilled was described by BP as \"exciting\" in a Sakhalin region that has already spawned multibillion pound developments for Shell and ExxonMobil. </p> <p>BP is already benefiting from a $7bn (\u00a34bn) merger with Russian oil group TNK which helped the British group to report an 11% rise in its third-quarter oil and gas output this week. </p> <p>But the Sakhalin drilling is not part of the TNK tie-up and has been undertaken by BP in cooperation with another Russian oil firm, Rosneft. </p> <p>BP said it had discovered significant amounts of oil and gas on the well drilled under an exploration licence for the Kaigansky-Vasukansky area. </p> <p>A spokesman for the British oil company said the hydrocarbon discovery was \"pretty exciting\" but the scale of the find would not be known until the well was properly tested, probably next year. </p> <p>The announcement caused alarm among environmental groups worried about Sakhalin's position as a whale breeding area. </p> <p>BP said it used \"whale watchers\" on its vessels but had not seen any in the area. Nick Rau, oil campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said Sakhalin was Russia's largest single fishing area. </p> <p>\"We would be very concerned about any further developments in this area where there are a lot of endangered species. No one has yet looked at the cumulative effect of all these different oil developments.\" </p> <p>Shell has been producing oil since 1999 at Sakhalin-2 while Exxon is planning to bring its Sakhalin-1 scheme on stream next year. </p> <p>Sakhalin is seen as an important future source of oil for export to the US while the gas could be shipped to Asia. </p> <p>Russian sources say the new site, Sakhalin-5, may hold 4.4bn barrels of oil - as much as the entire output of Qatar. But such estimates are seen by BP as unrealistic given the early nature of the drilling. </p> <p>Shell is already facing the wrath of Friends of the Earth after one of its vessels ran aground and caused an oil spill at Kholmsk on Sakhalin. </p> <p>Yesterday, environmental groups expressed anger that the Anglo-Dutch group was seeking to appoint an expert in crisis management and public relations for the area. </p> <p>\"Shell has created a beautifully crafted Potemkin village of environmental responsibility: it looks great, but there's nothing of substance behind it. It is very telling that we get an oil spin doctor before we get an oil spill response plan,\" said Doug Norlen of Pacific Environment. </p> <p>Shell declined to comment last night.</p>",

  "<p>Empty shelves in the stores, and now an empty desk in the finance director's office. Roger Matthews, the anonymous man on the Sainsbury's board, yesterday became the sixth director to depart this year - and that's even before new chief executive Justin King has said what he'll do with the business. </p> <p>Mr Matthews is going of his own volition, and not until next spring, so Sainsbury's could easily have sat on this news for a bit. Instead, it chose to go public ahead of the strategy announcement. Make of that what you will, but the City's view is this: if October 19 was going to be grim, it is now going to be very grim. </p> <p>Still, at least Mr Matthews' extended farewell means he will be around to shed light on the reasons behind the collapse in Sainsbury's competitive position over the past five years. </p> <p>One City analyst reckons most of the \u00a33bn spent on store and supply chain improvements has been wasted. </p> <p>That capital expenditure is often described as if it came from the personal budget of Sir Peter Davis, the ousted chief executive. </p> <p>Presumably, though, most of it was approved by the full board and Mr Matthews was involved in studies to measure cost-efficiency. </p> <p>He may also want to comment on suggestions among some Sainsbury's suppliers that they were asked to make upfront payments to the supermarket chain earlier this year - suggestions that Sainsbury's vehemently denies. </p> <p>Let's hope new chairman Philip Hampton - himself a finance director in his time - doesn't now hide Mr Matthews away in a dark corner. Mr Hampton, incidentally, seems to have developed a nasty case of chairmanitis, the tendency to generalise in the face of bad facts. Writing of Mr Matthews' five years at Sainsbury's, he says this was \"a very volatile time in the retail industry\". </p> <p>No, it wasn't. Consumers were remortgaging their houses to go shopping. It was boom time for retailers. Just ask Tesco, Philip Green, Asda, Burberry ... </p> <p><strong>New news, tricky test </strong><br> </p> <p>On the face of it, Reuters chief executive Tom Glocer has had something of an epiphany with his plan to develop the ubiquitous news and information service as a straightforward consumer brand. </p> <p>We will see the first demonstration of what they have in mind when Microsoft launches its media centre next Tuesday. </p> <p>Reuters has been selected as the sole news provider. As things currently stand, just about every media organisation in the world leverages Reuters' global network of correspondents - safe in the knowledge that, against so many of its direct news agency rivals, the information will be accurate and balanced. </p> <p>And for what? For decades now, the driver of profitability at Reuters has been its dealing services and the financial data it pipes into the world's financial sector. </p> <p>In any given year the news operation, upon which the unsullied reputation of Reuters essentially rests, barely washes its face. </p> <p>Meanwhile, with a few presentational and political tweaks, names like CNN, Fox News, the BBC, Google and Yahoo are routinely piggy-backing on Reuters information - and then taking all the glory and most of the revenue. </p> <p>(And yes, Guardian Unlimited's regular news updates are as reliant on Reuters as every other web service.) </p> <p>In aiming to expand Reuters from its traditional role as a wholesaler of information to full-on media retailer, Glocer will be helped by technology: with the belated arrival of mass broadband and 3G wireless, and the accompanying fragmentation of information sources, many will welcome a straightforward supplier of news they can trust. </p> <p>But completing this transformation while retaining Reuters' traditional revenue flows promises to be very tricky indeed - especially when Glocer is starting at least five years late. </p> <p><strong> Bidding for facts </strong><br> </p> <p>The weird and wonderful market in ebookers has presented another illustration of how knicker-twisted financial regulation creates the opposite of what it is supposed to, namely a false market. </p> <p>Back in early September ebookers said it had received takeover approaches from a number of parties. It quickly emerged that the most promising of these was from the owner of Expedia, the big American travel site, and shares in ebookers jumped 40% as a result. </p> <p>Yesterday, Expedia issued a formal statement saying it was no longer interested, and ebookers' price duly fell 15% on the news. </p> <p>But what about those other bidders mentioned four weeks ago? A clarifying statement from ebookers noting Expedia's decision but confirming talks were continuing with other parties was notable by its complete absence. </p> <p>CSFB, ebookers' financial advisers, refused to elaborate on the original statement - and as far as the regulators are concerned (spread between the Takeover Panel and the UK Listing authority) that statement is as good as the day it was issued. </p> <p>Which it clearly isn't.</p>",
  "<p>The recent procession of weak economic figures continued yesterday as growth in the UK's dominant services sector slowed to its lowest since June last year while mortgage equity withdrawal fell back, boosting speculation that interest rates may have peaked. </p> <p>The latest snapshot of the services sector from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed activity suffered its biggest one-month slowdown for three years. </p> <p>The survey's headline index fell to 54.7 last month from 56.9 in August - and was well below City expectations for a number of 56.5. It remained above the key 50 level, however, so was still signalling reasonable growth. </p> <p>New orders, too, grew at their slowest pace since June last year while cost pressures on companies increased due to both to oil prices and rising wage pressures. </p> <p>Transport-based companies reported the sharpest increase in average costs, the report said, reflecting soaring oil and fuel prices as crude futures climbed up steadily toward $50 a barrel during the month. </p> <p>A survey of the eurozone showed a similar slowdown, with the headline index dropping to 53.3 in September. </p> <p>The UK survey showed, however, that confidence in the service sector remained fairly high, with job creation running at the strongest pace for three-and-a-half years. </p> <p>\"While this is still a relatively healthy report, it is clear that the services sector has lost some momentum in recent months after a very robust performance in the first half of the year,\" said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. </p> <p>The CIPS survey is the latest in a series of weaker data from the British economy which is starting to make many analysts think that interest rates, which the Bank of England has raised to 4.75% this year, may not rise again. </p> <p>The Bank itself published data yesterday showing that mortgage equity withdrawal - when people borrow extra against the higher value of their house - fell to \u00a315bn in the April to June period, from \u00a315.4bn in the previous three months. Equity withdrawal is now at 7.6% of households' disposable income, down from 9% at the end of 2003. </p> <p>\"Overall, today's data suggest that both the services sector and households are feeling the effects of higher interest rates more strongly, and that activity has now peaked,\" said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics. </p> <p>John Butler at HSBC was less sure, however, arguing that both sets of data were consistent with economic growth of around 0.7% in the third quarter, slower than the second quarter's 0.9% figure but still robust. \"It is still far too early to conclude that the interest rate cycle has peaked, as is increasingly becoming the consensus view,\" he said. </p> <p>Separately, the Nationwide building society issued a report on consumer confidence showing far fewer people now thought their house would rise further in value than four months ago. The share dropped to 40% from 68%.</p>",
  "Generally speaking, only Australians are interested in Australian elections - and not of all them, at that. More so when, as is the case now, the incumbent prime minister, John Howard, looks likely to edge a fourth consecutive term. <p>For the Northern Rivers Echo in Lismore, New South Wales, the big news this week was the location of a new sewage plant. This pungent controversy has left the efforts of the Labor leader, Mark Latham, to defeat the Liberal-National coalition government, led by Mr Howard, in the shade. </p> <p>Another top story concerned a forthcoming celebration of International Lesbian Day at the Italo Club. \"Local identity Nora Vidler-Blanksby will MC,\" the Echo reported. \"The night includes a smorgasbord meal and DJ.\" </p> <p>The Alice Springs News was more exercised about the problem of petrol sniffing than who would be top dog in Canberra after Saturday's election. A Yuendumu community project at the Mt Theo outstation \"has provided a healing environment for sniffers\", a correspondent wrote. </p> <p>This is not to say that election news is entirely absent from the local press. In an apparently blatant bid for votes, the government has reportedly promised Alice Springs its own international airport. According to the Geelong Advertiser, Labor has pledged more funding for regional day-care centres. </p> <p>The Hobart Mercury was fixated meanwhile on Mr Latham's vow to end logging in Tasmania's conservation forests, seen as a transparent pitch for the Green vote. </p> <p>With Australia's economy booming, and unemployment and interest rates low, the two main political parties are not that far apart on domestic issues - although that has not prevented the customary argy-bargy. </p> <p>The hard-hitting Mr Howard's message is fairly basic: \"Who do you trust to keep the economy strong and to protect family living standards?\" His leadership alone would keep Australia secure, he says. Mr Latham, who, aged 43, is 22 years younger than the prime minister, believes it is time for a change. His vow to \"ease the squeeze on middle Australia\" and promote social values has led Mr Howard to dub him a \"behavioural policeman\". </p> <p>It is on international issues that the voters' options become more clear-cut, but even then, there is considerable policy overlap. </p> <p>Tapping into the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war, Mr Latham promised earlier this year to withdraw Australia's troops from the country by Christmas. But this Spanish-style pledge has now been watered down, with some forces likely to remain indefinitely. </p> <p>Echoing the British debate, Mr Latham accuses the prime minister, who in 1999 appointed himself America's regional \"deputy sheriff\", of being too eager to please the US president, George Bush, of undermining national security and misleading the country over Iraq. </p> <p>In a winning performance in a televised debate with Mr Howard, Mr Latham alluded to the terrorism in Bali, in 2002, which ended with 88 Australians killed, and to last month's bombing of Australia's embassy in Jakarta. Mr Howard's unquestioning support for the \"war on terror\" had rendered the country \"less safe\", he claimed. </p> <p>Labor says it wants a more regional approach to foreign and anti-terrorism policies and more emphasis on the UN and upholding international law. Funding would be provided, for example, to train Indonesia's police in counter-terrorism. </p> <p>But for all that, Mr Latham proposes no fundamental change in Australia's key US alliance or the Anzus mutual defence pact. And it was Mr Howard, after all, who long ago recognised the strategic and economic importance of building good relations with China, Asia's biggest player and biggest potential threat. Last year he gave the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, the honour of addressing parliament. </p> <p>This lack of clear alternatives may help Mr Howard keep his job. It also helps explain the local papers' preferred focus on stories like that of Brent Hall from Meerschaum Vale - who invented a macadamia nut harvester. In all innocence, he calls it the \"Bush Rat\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is Parmalat alleged to have done?</strong><br> Parmalat, an Italian company specialising in long-life milk, is suspected of having perpetrated a massive fraud. Billions of euros have gone missing from its books in a scandal that has drawn parallels with the collapse of Enron, the US energy giant. </p> <p>The company has admitted that the true level of its debt is \u20ac14.3bn (\u00a310bn) - eight times more than it claimed. Italian prosecutors are trying to convince a judge to order trials for 29 people, ranging from Parmalat's founder to former financial officers, accountants and lawyers.</p> <p><strong>How did Parmalat's crisis start?</strong><br> The questions began in December 2003 when Parmalat had difficulty making a \u20ac150m bond payment. The company, which had 36,000 employees, was supposed to have been been sitting on \u20ac3.95bn in cash, so Italian bankers were puzzled by its predicament. Parmalat's founder, Calisto Tanzi, brushed bankers' concerns aside, saying the company had a bit of a liquidity problem.</p> <p><strong>How did the crisis escalate?</strong><br> Parmalat's problems quickly reached epic proportions after it made the extraordinary admission that the \u20ac3.9bn it thought it had in the bank did not exist. The money was supposedly in a Bank of America account held by Bonlat, a subsidiary based in the Cayman Islands. But Bank of America said there was no such account.</p> <p><strong>Where were the auditors?</strong><br> Parmalat's primary auditor was Deloitte &amp; Touche, but the Milan branch of Grant Thornton dealt with some of the company's subsidiaries, including Bonlat. When Grant Thornton checked with Bank of America, the auditor received a letter on Bank of America letterhead confirming the existence of the account. However, Bank of America said the letter was forged. </p> <p>The Italian units of Bank of America and Deloitte &amp; Touche are among the defendants prosecutors want put on trial, as is the former Italian affiliate of Grant Thornton, which the auditor has now got rid of. Two partners of that affiliate have been sent for trial in January. They are the first individuals to be prosecuted in the scandal.</p> <p><strong>Did the money exist in the first place?</strong><br> Investigators have been trying to find out. There are suspicions that company executives invented contracts that were shown to the banks in order to raise cash that was then used to cover up day-to-day losses. </p> <p>\"The money was there in the first place but it got lost along the way,\" a US analyst said. Some press reports say as much as \u20ac10bn has disappeared from the company's accounts. </p> <p><strong>Did anybody harbour suspicions about Parmalat?</strong><br> Some analysts did voice concern about Parmalat's rapid expansion. The company started as a peddler of prosciutto in a small northern Italian hamlet but grew into a dairy giant selling long-lasting milk and other milk products in 30 countries, and employing 36,000 people. The global expansion started with an acquisition in Brazil in the mid-1970s. </p> <p><strong>Did the expansion run into trouble?</strong><br> As the company grew, so did its debt. It was bailed out in 1990, with the Tanzi family giving up 49% of its control of the company. </p> <p>Parmalat returned to the acquisition trail a few years later and bought US food giant Beatrice Foods in 1997. Other deals followed, taking the company into China, Australia and Mexico. In the process, Parmalat's debts grew to \u20ac6bn, but investors kept buying the company's bonds on the strength of its supposed cash pile. But at least one analyst thought the bonds too risky, describing them as \"junk bonds in drag\" two years ago. </p> <p><strong>Who were the architects of Parmalat's growth?</strong><br> The company was founded by Calisto Tanzi, a university dropout who transformed a family business, Calisto Tanzi &amp; Sons - Salamis and Preserves into an organisation hailed as one of Europe's biggest corporate success stories. </p> <p>Along the way, he relied on Fausto Tonna, who was the company's finance director for 16 years. \"Tonna was a bit of a peasant in his manners but had an extremely sharp mind for finances,\" said a banker who met him. If anyone has the answers it will be Mr Tanzi and Mr Tonna, who have both stepped down. </p> <p><strong>What happens to Parmalat now?</strong><br> The company has sought protection from its creditors after the Italian government rushed through an emergency decree that would allow companies to apply to the industry ministry to appoint an administrator with immediate powers. </p> <p>Enrico Bondi was appointed special administrator of the company in December 2003. Mr Bondi won acclaim for handling the break-up of the Ferruzzi family's business empire, Italy's biggest corporate crisis of the 1990s. </p> <p><strong>Will Parmalat survive?</strong><br> Parmalat is now in administration, so it enjoys protection from its creditors. But at some point it will probably have to sell off many of the companies it has acquired over the years. Analysts say the company was quietly seeking to offload assets in Mexico, Brazil and the US up to two years ago in an attempt to reduce its debts, but it was asking prices nobody wanted to pay. </p> <p>It will be different now, with Parmalat in a much weaker bargaining position. Global players such as Nestl\u00e9 and Danone would be the most likely candidates to pick up some of the Parmalat pieces. Parmalat will probably survive, but in much shrunken form. </p> <p><strong>What financial impact will the scandal have?</strong><br> Shares in the company, which once had a market value of \u20ac1.8bn, are worthless, so millions of investors are out of pocket. Bank of America is thought to have provided between $150m (\u00a384m) and $250m in loans to Parmalat, but those are trivial sums for America's third biggest bank.</p>",

  "<p>British teachers are to learn from their colleagues working in tough circumstances in Africa in a campaign announced yesterday, on World Teachers' Day. </p> <p>The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) is to send a representative to visit schools in Uganda along with Education Action International (EAI), a charity dedicated to supporting teachers all over the world, particularly those in conflict areas.</p> <p>The east African visit is part of a campaign by EAI to draw the attention of teachers across the UK to the plight of their counterparts in countries such as Uganda, Sudan and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Teachers in countries with poor infrastructure and few teacher training facilities face classes of more than 100 pupils with hardly any books, writing materials or even a proper classroom.</p> <p>Eight teachers will also make the trip to Uganda. It is hoped they will then cement their links with the African schools once back in the UK. \"Teaching about international cultures and sustainable development is emphasised in the national curriculum,\" said Lisa McFall of EAI, \"so learning about education in Uganda is very valuable.\"</p> <p>The acting general secretary of the NASUWT, Chris Keates, said: \"Our members benefit greatly from international links, and find they share many issues in common with foreign teachers, such as those of discipline and acts of violence against teachers.\"</p> <p>Ms Keates continued: \"Teachers' unions should stand for tackling injustice and we support the global campaign for primary education. We often forget that we receive high-quality education free of charge and we should use our own provision as a benchmark for what's happening elsewhere.\"</p> <p>In addition to the visit to Africa, EAI is asking 400,000 teachers from 25,000 schools to support their fellow teachers working in difficult conditions across the globe.

How can you get a quality teacher if you don't educate them, and only pay them 70p per day?\"</p> <p>The date October 5 was inaugurated as World Teachers' Day by Unesco in 1994 and was observed yesterday by more than 300 organisations across 100 countries.

  "<p>University chiefs should swallow their pride and start asking their alumni for money, the head of a top university said today. </p> <p>Malcolm Grant, the provost of University College London (UCL), today argued that British universities should lose the idea that asking for money is somehow \"not the British thing to do\" and be far more proactive as fundraisers, as he launched a \u00a3300m fundraising campaign.</p> <p>Professor Grant warned that if British universities were to compete on a global scale they needed to become as good at fundraising as their competitors in America. UCL today launched its Advancing London's Global University campaign, which aims to raise \u00a3300m over 10 years and place London firmly at the heart of the scholarly world. </p> <p>UCL's alumni will be approached for donations, along with the corporate sector, charitable trusts and industry.</p> <p>Professor Grant said: \"The challenge that we and the rest of the sector in the UK face is in increasing the proportion of overall philanthropic donation that universities receive. </p> <p>\"Compared to the US, the higher education sector takes a far smaller share of the country's overall level of philanthropic donation. \"I have heard it suggested that the concept of philanthropy is somehow alien to the national psyche, and that asking for money is not the British thing to do. This is, frankly, nonsense. </p> <p>\"Most of our leading universities owe their origins to philanthropy. Without the generosity of our founding fathers, UCL would never have seen the light of day back in 1826.\" He went on: \"We now have a huge, educated and wealthy middle class, who have benefited massively from the opportunities afforded them by a university education, and many of whom would be only too willing to support their institution were they given the opportunity.\" \"We need, in the university sector, to actively develop a culture both of asking, and a culture of giving.\" </p> <p>British university fundraising pales in comparison to the efforts of American universities. Harvard, for example, has an endowment of \u00a310bn compared to Oxford's \u00a32bn.</p> <p>In May this year, the vice-chancellor of the University of Bristol, Eric Thomas, published a government-backed report on university fundraising which suggested that British universities could raise at least an extra \u00a3600m a year if they employed US-style fundraising techniques to drum up cash from ex-students and big donors.</p> <p>The UCL Advancing London's Global University fundraising campaign aims to: <strong>\u00b7</strong> Earmark \u00a350m of the targeted funds to provide support for students and the next generation of academics, in the form of bursaries, scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fund the Institute of Women's Health - this will make a major contribution to the health care of women through research, education and clinical care, addressing the health needs of women across their entire life span; <strong>\u00b7</strong> Create the Intelligent Media Institute - a new centre to conduct research into new technologies and media that will forge the future of the creative industries in the UK - from art to architecture, music to materials, fashion to film, in collaboration with other London institutions; o Fund the Ear Institute - the campaign will help to fund a new national centre in London, working to find a cure for conditions such as tinnitus, that afflicts millions of people (the campaign aims to fund an endowed chair in tinnitus research); <strong>\u00b7</strong> Start a major refurbishment of the Wilkins Building, a London landmark, using state-of-the-art technology to ensure the library collection it houses becomes an important international resource for academics, researchers and students; <strong>\u00b7</strong> Fund the Spinal Repair Unit - UCL has recruited a world-renowned research team which aims to move to clinical trials as it works to restore lost movement to spinal cord patients;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Create the Panopticon - a new museum in the heart of London that would house one of the world's largest collections of ancient Egyptian artifacts, and an art collection that would include works by Durer, Rembrandt, Turner and Constable.</p>",

  "<p>Jackie Macpherson, deputy head at Campsie View School for young people with severe learning difficulties, is a woman who gets things done. When the standards expected of her pupils in a new curriculum introduced by the Scottish Qualifications Authority were, in her opinion, too high for them to achieve, Macpherson set about creating an alternative.</p> <p>While most people would have accepted the criteria and pushed the children towards unachievable goals, she worked with parents, teachers and the SQA to develop a pilot programme which adapted the curriculum to her pupils' skills and abilities.</p> <p>\"Our young people are functioning intellectually at a very early developmental stage. These are children who before 1974 would either have been in care homes or in hospital, not in education. We know now that they can achieve an enormous amount, but the SQA hadn't grasped the level they were at and was expecting too much.</p> <p>\"I thought their units were a very good starting point, so I took what they did and tried to make it fit our youngsters,\" says Macpherson. \"We broke them down into smaller and smaller steps so that they went at their pace.\" </p> <p>Now the pilot in East Dunbartonshire could be rolled out across Scotland. It is an achievement of which Carole Bowie, headteacher at Campsie View, is justifiably proud. \"For these children, life is difficult and if they can't see the relevance of something, they won't do it,\" says Bowie. </p> <p>\"Jackie made it more relevant and more motivating. That is one of her great strengths. She'll grab anything and run with it for the benefit of the kids.\"</p> <p>It was this determination that led Robert McComb, partnership at work officer at East Dunbartonshire council, to nominate Macpherson, 53, for the Guardian Public Servant of the Year Award.</p> <p>\"Jackie really stood out as an extraordinary person,\" he says. \"She's one of those people that goes beyond the call of duty. It's easy for us in jobs to be given new standards and know that they are not achievable, but just go along with it. But here is a person who actually challenged the system by working to find a better way.</p> <p>\"She is very, very modest and doesn't seek recognition, but when you see what she's achieved and the difference she will make across Scotland, it's just amazing.\"</p> <p>Campsie View School is in Lenzie, just outside Glasgow.

Earlier this year, the school opened a sensory garden with colourful and aromatic plants to stimulate the children's learning.</p> <p>The school has been repeatedly praised in inspections for its positive ethos, standard of teaching, professionalism of staff and the delivery of the curriculum. </p> <p>Last year's report by HM Inspectorate of Education gave the school the highest possible grade, praising in particular the happy, stimulating and secure environment, the commitment of the staff and their respect for the pupils' dignity and individuality, and the high expectations set for pupils, whose achievements are celebrated. </p> <p>Unusually, the report also singled out Macpherson, remarking that she carried out her duties \"with distinction\". </p> <p>As well as being deputy head, Macpherson is also responsible for speech and language therapy provision, IT support and helping the pupils' transition from school to the outside world. Earlier this year she accepted an invitation to speak about her experience of post-school provision at a conference run by the Scottish executive. It is a subject about which she is passionate.</p> <p>\"There's a long way to go before our young people's needs once they leave school are met,\" she says. \"There is a lack of options and services are desperately stretched. Our pupils might have been with us from the age of two until they leave at 19 and will be used to a long, busy day surrounded by friends doing the things they like. It can be very hard for them to leave, especially if the only option is to say at home, which wouldn't be right for any 19-year-old.\"</p> <p>Before joining the school seven years ago, Macpherson worked as a home visitor for pre-school children with complex educational needs. She says it was the fulfilment of her professional ambition when her application for the deputy headship at Campsie View was successful.</p> <p>Asked what she enjoys most about her job, there is no contest. \"The children,\" she says. \"That's what we are all here for. They constantly surprise you and the more you work with them, the more you know they can achieve. First and foremost they are children and they are students and they merit the same experiences and expectations that every other child should have.\"</p> <p>Macpherson is keen to emphasise the skills of the entire school staff working in what can be an extremely stressful environment. She appears embarrassed to have been singled out for an award.</p> <p>\"I am really lucky,\" she insists. \"I love the job I do and the people I work with are fantastic. I am pleased to have been shortlisted, but it did come as an amazing shock because I didn't even know I was in for it.\"</p> <p>But Bowie is delighted that her deputy is finally getting national recognition for her work. \"Jackie is a total one-off,\" she says. \"We deal with the most vulnerable children in society. They are very talented, very interesting young people with big personalities, but they can be unpredictable and difficult to manage. Jackie won't see the children's difficulties - she'll see the child. She sees talent and opportunity in everyone and she inspires everyone she works with. That deserves to be celebrated.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ruth Iveson, it is said, is running a special kind of dating agency. Her matchmaking skills have encouraged people with a wide range of conditions such as long term depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and learning difficulties into meaningful work in the health service. </p> <p>Iveson is the human resources manager of Mersey care NHS trust, a massive organisation with 5,000 staff providing the whole range of mental health and learning difficulties services across Liverpool, Sefton and Kirby.</p> <p>She is thought to be the first HR manager in the country to work solely with service users and carers to help them into work and also to have a say in recruiting the very people who will be providing their care and services.</p> <p>Iveson's work has meant that patients and their families have been able to take part in interview boards for everyone from the chief executive and consultant psychiatrists and nurses to administrators and catering staff.</p> <p>She has travelled across Merseyside speaking to voluntary and community groups about patient involvement and recruited more than 80 service users and carers who now play an active part in recruitment at the trust. To date they have been involved in more than 500 appointments and are now a normal part of the employment process.</p> <p>As Iveson explains: \"People said that doctors and nurses were coming into their homes and lives and they wanted to play a more active part in deciding who they are.\"</p> <p>Everyone on the recruitment scheme receives a four-day intensive course making them aware of the whole process from writing job advertisements, and compiling job descriptions, through to interviews and, if a candidate is successful, the corporate induction programme. </p> <p>Iveson trains and supports service users and carers to co-run the induction programme for all new staff which takes place every two weeks. And they each receive a fee of \u00a310 per hour in recognition of any of the work they do.</p> <p>According to Iveson, the scheme has given managers new insights into the sort of people they recruit: \"Service users and carers ask different sorts of questions. Not about qualifications and experience but saying things like, 'Is this is sort of person that I would like to look after me and come into my home?'</p> <p>\"Managers have said that it gives them a greater insight into the real responsibilities they have. Some people have said: 'I would never have thought of asking those questions.' They realise how important they are.\"</p> <p>The scheme has also been extended outside the trust to Liverpool University, where service users and carers talk to students on the clinical psychology course. </p> <p>Says Iveson: \"We have got some really good feedback from students, who tell us that having an understanding from the other perspective helps them to be better prepared.\" </p> <p>The pool of 80 service users and carers also have a role in patient environment action teams (Peat) that cover catering, cleanliness and the general quality of the hospital environment. In addition, the trust's Access to Employment (ACE) scheme has been designed to get service users back into employment and share some of their own experiences and insights with other staff.</p> <p>Since the scheme was launched last year, Iveson has identified 10 people who between them had more than 66 years of unemployment. Six have since secured full time jobs with the trust and two have gone into further education. \"We thought it was quite something to get such a success rate,\" says Iveson.</p> <p>The jobs were awarded on merit in competition with other applicants and there is scope for promotion and career development. To date six people have been employed as nursing assistants, administration assistants in the chief executive's office - one of who has now moved on to be the PA of another manager - and head of payroll for the section dealing with travelling expenses. </p> <p>\"These people have a breadth of experience and expertise and a high level of empathy which they can share with colleagues,\" says Iveson.</p> <p>She has also established an informal 'buddy scheme' for employees working in the field of mental health, in recognition of the fact that they can suffer high levels of stress and mental illness. </p> <p>\"People working in mental health service sometimes find it very difficult to admit they need some help themselves or are simply nervous about asking their own employer for help,\" Iveson explains. </p> <p>The scheme allows them to call on help and support without going through official management and clinical arrangements for sick staff.</p> <p>Lyndsey Dyer, director for service users and carers at the trust, says she proposed Iveson, 58, for the Guardian Public Servant of the Year Award not only for her tireless work with service users and carers, but for changing the role of NHS directors of human resources so that they can make a direct difference in the lives of these people. </p> <p>\"She goes the extra mile,\" Dyer explains. \"The service user or carer's needs always come first. She works outside her designated hours, she never lets barriers get in her way. In terms of innovation, Ruth is challenging and changing the traditional role of HR - service users and carers are as important a 'resource' as staff.\"</p> <p>She also feels Iveson's approach could be replicated elsewhere in the NHS. \"I am an old hand in the NHS but I think Ruth is simply fabulous. She has done some pioneering and innovative work to ensure that service users and carers have a real say.\"</p> <p>Evaluations of the approach show people have gained confidence, acquired new skills, increased their feelings of self worth, realised that they have something to contribute and gained employment. </p> <p>As one service user puts it: \"I have gained increased confidence in myself, which gave me increased personal skills, which has led to me gaining employment... a working man is changing, from many years of drug use, into a responsible citizen.\"</p>",
  "<p>Reuters, the international media and information group, intends to offer a video news service to consumers in a move that marks a significant shift in its corporate strategy. </p> <p>The Reuters Channel will be the first news service available on a new media centre service launched by software group Microsoft in the United States next week. </p> <p>The availability of the interactive service in consumers' homes represents a departure for Reuters - which earns some 90% of its revenues by providing financial information to investment banks, brokers and currency traders. </p> <p>Reuters' news service is a wholesale operation, which is used by newspapers and other media agencies. </p> <p>The tie-up with Microsoft is part of a much broader strategy that has been put in place by chief executive Tom Glocer to leverage the group's 154-year-old brand in the consumer market. </p> <p>\"We have ambitions to do more in the direct-to-consumer market,\" he told the Guardian yesterday. </p> <p>It is unclear how much the new strategy will cost. \"We don't yet have a big budget,\" said Mr Glocer. The news channel - located on Microsoft's media centre - will be supported by advertising. </p> <p>Mr Glocer's plans come almost two years after the former corporate lawyer - who is the first non-journalist to head the company - launched a massive cost-cutting drive. </p> <p>Although the plans are only at an early stage, Mr Glocer already sees the consumer market as a crucial driver of growth for Reuters in the wake of a difficult three-year rationalisation programme dubbed Fast Forward. </p> <p>\"If I'm going to stay around after Fast Forward,\" he said yesterday, \"that's what I want to do.\" </p> <p>The new strategy will directly involve Niall FitzGerald - who joined Reuters as chairman earlier this year after eight years at the top of consumer giant Unilever, which produces Lipton tea and Persil. </p> <p>Chris Aherne, the former banker who is now head of the media operation at Reuters, has been put in charge of the new project. </p> <p>The plans are expected to harness the group's reputation for unbiased, international reporting, and to use new broadband technologies like streaming video. </p> <p>Mr Glocer's ambitions were encouraged by the success of the raw feed available online, such as the entire text of Ken Bigley's statement. </p> <p>Some 1.5m video clips are downloaded each month from Reuters.co.uk. </p> <p>A company spokeswoman said: \"We were quite surprised by the level of interest.\" </p> <p>Company executives believe the company's output - it has some 2,300 editorial staff in 197 bureaux in 92 countries around the world - give it unrivalled coverage of international events. </p> <p>Unlike CNN and the BBC, Reuters believes it is not associated in the public mind with a single country. </p> <p>The London-based company was founded in 1850 in Aachen, Germany. </p> <p>Executives also believe the company has consistently missed golden opportunities for a direct consumer service. It sold its news to the start-up CNN, for instance, rather than setting up its own television service. It did the same thing for Yahoo! on the internet many years later. </p> <p>The plans appear to end speculation that Reuters is planning to pull out of its news coverage operation altogether after cutting 3,000 of its 18,333 jobs in 2002. </p> <p>\"We all know the brand comes from news,\" said a spokesman yesterday. </p> <p>Reuters spent \u00a38m on an advertising campaign a year ago - its first for four years -which emphasised the value of its news values, accuracy and global presence. The ads were targeted at traders, analysts, and financial advisors but appeared on major TV channels and outdoor sites. They focused specifically on the notion of trust. Tim Duffy, the M&amp;C Saatchi marketing director behind the ads, told the Wall Street Journal: \"There's an environment at the moment where it's important to get things right. Trust is something that right now has a premium.\" </p> <p>A strategic shift is likely to unnerve analysts and investors. Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis Securities, said: \"Looking at speculative diversions would not be the right thing to be doing right now.\" </p> <p>The City also has unhappy memories of the company's push online four years ago, which involved an attack on the consumer market and which failed. Since then, Reuters has been praised for its wholesale strategy: \"They positioned themselves as the seller of spades in a gold rush rather than the gold digger,\" said Mr Richards.</p>",
  "Many around the world are surprised at how little attention the economy is receiving in President Bush's re-election campaign. But I am not surprised: if I were Bush, the last thing I would want to talk about is the economy. Yet many people look at America's economy, even over these past three-and-a-half years, with some envy. Annual economic growth - at an average rate of 2.5% - may have been markedly slower than during the Clinton years, but it still looks strong compared with Europe's anaemic 1%. <p>But these statistics mask a glaring fact: the average American family is worse off than it was three-and-a-half years ago. Median income has fallen by over $1,500 in real terms, with families being squeezed as wages lag behind inflation. In short, all that growth benefited only those at the top of the income distribution, the same group that had done so well over the previous 30 years and benefited most from Bush's tax cut. </p> <p>For example, some 45 million Americans have no health insurance, up by 5.2 million from 2000. Families lucky enough to have health insurance face annual premiums that have nearly doubled, to $7,500. Families also face increasing job insecurity. This is the first time since the early 1930s that there has been a net loss of jobs over the span of a presidential administration. </p> <p>Bush supporters ask: is Bush really to blame for this? Wasn't the recession already beginning when he took office? </p> <p>The resounding answer is that Bush is to blame. Every president inherits a legacy. The economy was entering a downturn when Bush took office, but Clinton also left a huge budget surplus - 2% of GDP - a pot of money with which to finance a robust recovery. But Bush squandered that surplus, converting it into a deficit of 5% of GDP through tax cuts for the rich. </p> <p>The productivity growth that was sustained through the downturn presented an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity: if the economy was well managed, the incomes of Americans could continue to rise as they had done in the 1990s. The challenge: to manage the economy so that growth would be robust enough to create the new jobs required by new entrants to the labour force. Bush failed the challenge, and America lost the opportunity. </p> <p>True, the economy was stimulated a little by the tax cuts. But there were other policies that would have provided far more stimulus at far less cost. Bush's objective was to push forward a tax agenda that shifted the burden away from those who could best afford to bear it. </p> <p>Bush's failed policies have cost the economy dearly, and have left it in a far weaker position going forward. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office agrees that the deficit will not be eliminated in the foreseeable future - or even cut in half, as Bush has promised. Expenditures on which America's future economic health depends - infrastructure, education, health and technology - will be crowded out. </p> <p>Because fiscal policy did not stimulate the economy, a greater burden was placed on monetary policy. Lower interest rates worked (a little), but for the most part by encouraging households to refinance their mortgages, not by stimulating investment. The increased indebtedness of households is already leading to higher bankruptcy rates, and will likely dampen the recovery. </p> <p>National debt too has risen sharply. The huge trade deficit provides the spectacle of the world's richest country borrowing almost $2bn a day from abroad, contributing to the weak dollar and representing a major source of global uncertainty. </p> <p>There might be some hope for the future if Bush owned up to his mistakes and changed course. But no: he refuses to take responsibility for the economy, just as his administration fails to take responsibility for its failures in Iraq. In 2003, having seen that its tax cuts for the rich had failed to stimulate the economy, the administration refused to revise its strategies. </p> <p>In August, I joined nine other American Nobel prize winners in economics in signing an open letter to the public. We wrote: \"President Bush and his administration have embarked on a reckless and extreme course that endangers the long-term economic health of our nation ... The differences between President Bush and John Kerry with respect to leadership on the economy are wider than in any other presidential election in our experience. President Bush believes that tax cuts benefiting the most wealthy Americans are the answer to almost every economic problem.\" </p> <p>Here, as elsewhere, Bush is dead wrong, and too dogmatic to admit it. </p> <p>Joseph Stiglitz is professor of economics at Columbia University and a Nobel prize winner </p> <p>\u00a9 Project Syndicate </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</a></p>",
  "<p>UK Coal, Britain's biggest coal mining group, yesterday justified a decision to sack its chief executive, Gordon McPhie, saying it needed to improve its operating performance. </p> <p>Mr McPhie left last Friday with a \u00a3350,000 payoff and is to be replaced by Gerry Spindler, one of UK Coal's non-executives. </p> <p>The 56-year-old former president of Pittston Mineral Group is a US citizen but plans to move to Britain full-time. </p> <p>Amid mounting fears that there could be more job losses, UK Coal insisted that there would be no great change to the group's strategy but just more emphasis on \"delivery\". </p> <p>Ironically Mr McPhie leaves the company along with many rank-and-file miners as UK Coal completes the closure of Riccall, the final colliery at Selby in North Yorkshire, once the biggest coal complex in Europe. </p> <p>UK Coal made clear that Mr McPhie was paying the price for a cost-cutting programme that has gone into reverse. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the firm said that the price of mining the company's coal had gone down to 109p per gigajoule but then returned to 130p. \"Results needed to be improved,\" she explained. </p> <p>Other sources close to the company spoke of Mr McPhie as being a \"very good finance guy but not a leader of men bringing coal out of the ground\". </p> <p>There had been \"a bit of investor pressure\" for change at the top but there was a feeling in the upper ranks of the firm that it was time for new blood, sources explained. </p> <p>UK Coal has been under a new chairman for 18 months since the arrival of David Jones, formerly chairman of National Grid. </p> <p>Analysts believed Mr Jones had played a crucial role in pushing for a new chief executive. </p> <p>Mr McPhie was unavailable for comment but is understood to have left the company with 12-months' salary under the terms of his contract but no bonus. </p> <p>Last month UK Coal reported a set of poor interim financial figures showing that operating losses on continuing operations before exceptionals had gone from a \u00a3700,000 profit to a loss of \u00a314.2m. </p> <p>Mr McPhie admitted UK Coal had also seen output from its deep mines plunge nearly 25% to 6m tonnes. </p> <p>He described the results as \"disappointing\".</p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard yesterday gave Conservatives a clear reminder of why they were right to get rid of Iain Duncan Smith as their leader. Mr Duncan Smith's nasty and ill-judged party conference speech in Blackpool a year ago was another reminder of how difficult it has been for successive Tory leaders, from John Major onwards, to find an effective rhetorical alternative to Tony Blair. Mr Howard had clearly given a lot of thought to that problem. His answer was an intelligent one: to avoid grandiloquence, to adopt a more explicatory tone, to make his story more personal (resulting in some particularly effective passages) and, above all, to offer himself as an alternative kind of politician, a man with his feet on the ground not his head in the clouds, as Lord Saatchi put it yesterday. </p> <p>As far as it goes, this is an attractive strategy. We badly need a more truthful and accountable form of politics. But Mr Howard also gave his party a reminder of why he has not solved many of their more basic problems. An opposition party that is in danger of losing a third successive election needs to fire up its supporters, not to dampen them down; so, while Mr Howard can be commended for not opting for negative attacks, he can also be criticised for not giving his party clear lines on which to campaign against Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who were barely mentioned in the speech. </p> <p>It was also bad luck for Mr Howard that the evangelical Blair style against which his speech was so self-consciously constructed was also rather conspicuously abandoned by the prime minister in Brighton; Mr Howard, in other words, may be attacking a diminishing target. But the biggest problem was simply this: Mr Howard is an old-style politician to his finger-tips. For this most barristerial of all politicians to pose as an \"anti-politician\" is inherently implausible. </p> <p>The chief criticism of his speech was not its style but its substance. The list of subjects which the Tory leader failed to address was a long one. It included the economy and the business agenda - an almost incredible omission by a Tory leader in the run-up to an election - the environment, constitutional reform (Europe inevitably excepted), and the great traditional Tory rallying-cry of individual freedom. In the video shown to delegates before Mr Howard's entrance, freedom was a central theme (to the stirring accompaniment of Elgar's Nimrod); in his speech, he had almost nothing to say about it. And he bottled out of saying that the imperative to obey the law extends to the law on hunting with dogs. </p> <p>The speech was stronger on cliches than on firm pledges. The Tory leader tried to give the impression that a Howard government would spring instantly into life with an all-action agenda, but the commitments were few and general. Mr Howard said almost nothing of substance on health, education and pensions, beyond people being entitled to choice. The section on tax was deliberately opaque. The most settled prospectus was his old Home Office specialities of crime and immigration. </p> <p>The most striking and most carefully constructed part was on Europe. Here the pledges suddenly got more specific - a referendum on the EU constitution by September 2005, withdrawal from the social chapter, from the common fisheries policy and from EU overseas aid programmes. The delegates responded fervently - a sign of the Tory party's undiminished grassroots Europhobia. The big question in the conference corridors remains whether such pledges are enough to blunt the challenge of the UK Independence party. Mr Howard seems to have struck a dirty deal with John Redwood to persuade the businessman Paul Sykes to stop bankrolling Ukip. From a man who says he wants to give it to us straight, this seems very much like old politics as usual.</p>",

Comic Relief is unrepentant. \"We work with companies to help us raise much-needed money that will reach some of the poorest and most vulnerable people across the world,\" says a statement.</p>",
  "<p>The UN Millennium development goals, adopted by world leaders in 2000 to address poverty, health and environmental problems, are \"off track\" in 72 middle-income countries, according to a report by the Department for International Development (Dfid) that shows very few of these countries are likely to meet their targets, and that progress over the next 11 years will be slow and uneven. </p> <p>The problem, says the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, is that much of the US$17bn (\u00a39.4bn) a year given in aid to countries has gone towards achieving the donors' own political and commercial priorities, rather than making the poor better off. The report suggests that enough aid is being given already and that these countries don't need more, but better focused, aid. </p> <p>The solution, says Benn, is for Dfid to redirect its funding from programmes on the ground in middle income countries - where one third of the world's poorest people, earning less than US$1 a day, live - to influencing organisations like the World Bank, and the world's leading economies, to make sure they achieve the millennium targets. </p> <p>\"In some highly unequal countries, cash may not be the solution; it may be better to influence decision-makers through debates about different policy options that would lead to greater equity and poverty reduction,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Unlike Africa, the challenge is not about delivering large volumes of aid, but about ensuring the international system provides the right mix of high quality technical advice and international experience,\" Benn said. </p> <p>\"It is the poorest countries - that is the low-income countries, primarily found in Africa and Asia - that have the greatest need for the most development assistance. These are the countries with the highest and severest levels of poverty.\" </p> <p>This, say development campaigners, is fine in theory, but leaves Dfid with little legitimacy in the countries where it has cut funding. It also removes support for poor communities in their fight to get their own governments to sort out the problems - home-grown solutions usually prove to be more long lasting and effective. </p> <p>Without representation on the ground, said Lesley-Anne Knight, head of programmes at development agency Cafod, there is no way Dfid could \"guarantee that any country will have pro-poor policies or that they will have a strong enough civil society to persuade their governments to change.\" </p> <p>Matthew Lake, programme manager at Concern Universal, which runs projects to build strong civil societies, said that while Dfid says the right things, there is a feeling that they are passing the buck. \"Dfid has done some excellent work but now they are leaving these communities to it. Long-term changes in these countries can only come from the ground up, not from the top down,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Benn denies this, saying that the programmes won't be cut until later this year, giving them time to plan responsibly: \"In Bolivia our funding to the national agricultural programme will be sustained by other donors. Similarly, our support to communities in the flooded forest areas of the Amazon is being picked up by German funding.\" </p> <p>Critics, however, have pointed out that writing a strategy after decisions have already been taken undermines its integrity. Others have called the plan nothing more than \"window dressing\", arguing that Benn is being too optimistic if he thinks that by stopping Dfid's presence on the ground he can influence the big players behind closed doors. </p> <p>Tony Baldry, Chairman of the International Development Select Committee, says: \"The cuts have meant the closure of offices in Peru and the closure of the office in Honduras, only months after it had opened. In Peru, Dfid is totally disengaging, so no matter how intellectually robust you make the argument to influence multilaterals, the reality is that Dfid won't have the levers on the ground. It is intellectually coherent, but it won't happen in practice.\" </p> <p><strong>Between the lines</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Middle-income countries (MICs) include Albania, Columbia, Peru, Samoa, Iraq, Iran, the Maldives, Thailand, Ecuador, Surinam and Swaziland. Per capita incomes range from $750 (\u00a3421) a year to more than $9,000 (\u00a35,047). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> These countries are home to about 280 million people living on less than $1 a day and 870 million people living on less than $2 a day. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> According to the Overseas Development Institute thinktank, MICs \"account for substantial absolute levels of global poverty and deprivation\", and have \"high levels of inequality, widespread social exclusion and discrimination\".</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, Tim Smit was unknown. He had a degree in archaeology and anthropology from Durham; he had been a lousy busker; a goodish music producer and rock 'n' roller; and he was restoring Heligan, an old garden in Cornwall. A good guy, but hardly one of Europe's leading thinkers, entrepreneurs, businessmen or creative artists - and certainly not someone to whom ministers and foreign governments made beelines for tips about social innovation. </p> <p>But Smit will be at the Albert Hall in London next week, lecturing 3,000 people at a Day of Inspiration on how to change the world and realise people's potential. He has achieved minor celebrity status and has been showered with awards and honours - including a CBE and the Royal Society of Arts' Albert Medal, which is awarded to only one person in the world each year; previous recipients include Michael Faraday, Louis Pasteur, Madame Curie, Orville Wright and Ralph Vaughan Williams. </p> <p>Somehow, Smit has invented himself as Britain's motivator, a radical thinker who has proved that it is possible to make social and environmental change happen in the most unlikely ways. So, what happened in between? </p> <p>The answer, of course, is the Eden Project, the collection of giant domes and structures dreamed up by Smit and a friend and built, against all the physical and financial odds, in a derelict Cornish claypit. </p> <p>In five years, he and his team have turned what most people believed was a worthless, unusable, polluted site into Britain's fifth largest tourist attraction. It has drawn in 2 million people a year, raised \u00a3120m and is thought to have pumped \u00a3500m into the local economy. Now employing 500 people in a job-starved area, Eden has, almost without wishing to, become one of Britain's most successful regeneration projects. Which is not bad for a man who once produced the Nolan Sisters and Barry Manilow and who played keyboards on a record that briefly topped the Belgian charts. </p> <p>But Eden is more interesting than its statistics, or even the hundreds of thousands of plants growing under its emblematic domes. It is, say people who know it, becoming a great experiment, a test bed for ideas about how you can make change happen in Britain and unlock individual or national potential. </p> <p>Smit's secret, if there is one, seems to be that he can bring people of very different disciplines and skills together, get them to brainstorm and collaborate, and come up with the extraordinary. The Eden Project, he says, has attracted locals by the score, but also high-flying artists, businessmen, architects, scientists, engineers, educationalists, horticulturalists and ecologists from all over Britain. </p> <p>\"It feels like a renaissance organisation,\" says one woman who left a senior management job to work there as a director and has been amazed both at what gets done and the way it works. \"It's attracted a critical mass of people, and there's this passionate belief, right through the project, that it belongs to everyone who works there, that it's a team thing. I guess it demonstrates that you can have an organisation that is highly effective financially, environmentally and socially. It's a kind of experiment to show that you can work in different ways.\" A local woman who has been with Eden since the start is more succinct. \"It's the most equal place I've known,\" she says. </p> <p>\"This is a stage for change,\" says Smit, who admits that Eden can seem like a sect to outsiders. \"Many people have made life choices to come here. Most could earn five times as much elsewhere. But I'm aware that if you want to effect real change, and we do, that you must not own it. You have got to make sure that it's owned by more than one person.\" </p> <p>Smit, 50, half Dutch on his father's side, and with the air of a favourite uncle, can sound alarmingly like a personal development guru when he articulates how to achieve potential. Exuding positivity, he rejects all cynicism, hates the way idealism has been equated with naivety, and reels off truisms and catchphrases, such as \"start where you want to be and work back\", \"pursue only what interests you\", \"you have to love something to make it work\", and \"I want to know what victory is like before the war\". </p> <p>But his underlying point is always that change comes when people think differently and take risks. He says: \"We challenged a lot of people to say 'no', to say that Eden could not be done. But hundreds of people said 'yes'. I think the fear of losing paralyses people. The key to making Eden work was daring to lose, and the realisation that millions of people feel inside themselves that there is more in life than what they have done. There is a massive hunger in our generation, a feeling that people are not putting their talents to best use.\" </p> <p>He tries to make people think differently and to challenge their prejudices. \"I say to people [when they work here] that they've got to say hello to 20 people every day; read a book that they would never normally read, and then discuss it; cook a meal for all the people who make it worthwhile going to work; make someone else's wishes come true . . . There are 10 of these. They're all symbolic, but they make people think differently.\" </p> <p>Smit says he has been greatly influenced by people such as Ricardo Semler, the maverick Brazilian socialist who runs a large manufacturing business and lets his employees set their own hours and wages - but gets long-term loyalty and phenomenal growth. \"He read about the kid who hacked into a defence system, and offered him a job,\" Smit says. \"He told him just to walk around till he saw something that interested him, and then ended up with a free computer system. He realised that the establishment is miles off the pace of what's really going on. Eden is a bit similar. People make it their own. It's what they want it to be.\" </p> <p>Eden is growing fast, but he certainly does not want to see it franchised out and devalued. \"I've turned down 13 countries and \u00a3100m,\" he says. \"We say go and rearrange the phrase 'off and fuck'. What we have built is not Disney: it's a physical response to our own attitudes. One Arab country came, but I said it needed Arab poets, Arab astronomers, Arab builders. It's got to be all Arab.\" </p> <p>But Eden is just a start, a platform for wider social and environmental change, says Smit. He wants to address local problems such as housing, much of which is priced beyond the means of locals. \"We have to be radical,\" he says. \"For too long, we have associated affordable housing with cheap building. But analysis shows that building on the cheap is ridiculously expensive in terms of energy consumption and maintenance in the long term. We must produce attractive, sustainable, affordable housing that people will be proud to own.\" He has been working in a personal capacity with developers, public sector representatives and the Liberal Democrat MP for North Cornwall, Paul Tyler. </p> <p>Next week, at the Albert Hall, this incurable optimist will talk about globalisation and its potential. It comes, he says, from musing on the reasons why civilisations collapse: \"Because they think they can trash the environment, or when they lose their values.\" </p> <p>Smit recalls: \"I was at Eden and there was a dance one night. All these Bangladeshis, Chinese, Costa Ricans and others were there, and I thought: 'Fuck, I've been looking at the wrong thing.' I realised that, instead of being at the fag end of a culture, we were at the start of a great new civilisation and an era of massive personal democratisation. </p> <p>\"Perhaps the most committed environmentalists, such as Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, are wrong, and the small farmers are better off with Mr Unilever. Political correctness stops us thinking. We must keep questioning.\" </p> <p>He totally rejects the idea that kids are less feeling, that the computer age has bred only geeks, or that Britain is fast becoming a bland consumer society. Instead, he argues that it is becoming a much more democratic society, in the sense that people are taking more charge of their lives. Only when it comes to politics does he see what he regards as the hopeless. \"Politicians are like remainder-book salesmen,\" he says. \"They just haven't understood that people have moved way beyond them. </p> <p>\"What I find interesting about Britain is that it has the most individualistic people, and yet also the most acquiescent. They've got a bloody-mindedness that I like. If I could change anything, it would be that people believed in their own improvability.\" For a society to thrive, it must remain true to its core cultural values, he says. In Britain's case, these are probably generosity and humanism. \"There is a right way of doing things and a wrong way. The wrong way is anything that does not accord to kindness and virtuosity.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tim Smit will be talking at the Royal Society of Arts' Day of Inspiration at the Royal Albert Hall on Monday, October 11.

  "The politics of disablism surfaced again on Monday in a rowdy demo outside the London headquarters of Scope, the charity for people with cerebral palsy. <p>A score or more of disabled people, some in wheelchairs, came to accuse Tony Manwaring, the charity's chief executive, of taking a high-handed approach to the people it serves. The charity was forewarned and the protesters were blocked by police.</p> <p>The demonstrators were from the Disabled People's Direct Action Network (DAN). Its spokeswoman says: \"Scope's current practice of incarcerating disabled people, young and old, in residential institutions, and the continued segregation of disabled children in their special schools, is discrimination at its very worst.\"</p> <p>The activists complain that the charity launched its Time to Get Equal campaign this year without adequate consultation with the people whose equality it espoused.</p> <p>The charity replies: \"In early September this year, we invited DAN to meet with Scope outside a protest atmosphere and specifically to discuss their response to the Time to Get Equal campaign. We received no reply. We have subsequently invited them to meet with us through a mediator, but have still received no reply.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman says Manwaring and Andy Rickell, the disabled people's activist who was recruited this year to be the charity's executive director for diversity and corporate planning, were still prepared to meet with two representatives of DAN by appointment, but not during the course of a demonstration.</p> <p>Sharon Hughes, a trustee of Scope and wheelchair user with cerebral palsy, says the charity does involve disabled people in its campaigning and supports segregated education only when pupils' needs could not be met adequately in an inclusive environment.</p> <p>DAN wants the charity to ring-fence all new jobs for disabled people. Hughes says it had a target of employing at least 20% disabled people by 2008. That might require positive discrimination, but there would be no immediate ring-fencing.</p>",
  "Despite \u00a312bn spending by water companies on sewage and storm water treatment works over 14 years, 95% of British rivers will fail to meet new European standards for water quality if further work is not done, the government conceded yesterday. <p>Since the privatisation of water companies in 1990 there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of water in rivers, with fish returning to areas which had been dead for 100 years. But the EU rules mean that a new way of managing rivers must be adopted, said the environment minister Elliot Morley. </p> <p>Instead of just using chemical content and dissolved oxygen as a way of measuring the health of rivers, the directive demands much higher standards of river management, including maintaining water flows and diversity of life, and the removal of hormone disrupting substances which are turning thousands of male fish into females. The directive also applies to lakes, estuaries and coastal and ground waters which were previously not measured. </p> <p>In total 82% of all water bodies in the UK are at risk of failing the EU's new standards, and more than half of groundwater sources. About a third of the country's drinking water is extracted from groundwater and it also feeds the springs from which streams and rivers flow. </p> <p>Mr Morley said: \"In effect we are going back to year zero on the health of our rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastline, to a completely new process that looks at the whole ecological balance. It is a huge and important task but one that is welcomed by the government and will be by the public generally.\" </p> <p>Currently 93% of rivers in England are classed as in good or fair condition for chemical content, compared with 73% in 1990. The levels of oxygen have also risen: 95% are of good or fair quality compared with 89% in 1990. </p> <p>Nearly all this improvement had been brought about through \"end of pipe\" solutions, upgrading industrial and sewage disposal facilities, said Sir John Harman, the chairman of the Environment Agency. He said progress had slowed since 2000, with some rivers getting worse again because of low flows caused by drought. </p> <p>\"Around 30% of our rivers, however, still need improvement, and one in six rivers in urban areas are still classed as 'poor' or 'bad'.\" </p> <p>He said the EU directive would provide a more detailed picture of the ecological health of rivers and new ways of measuring quality. </p> <p>Although the new rules from the EU water framework directive do not come into force until 2015, the new targets are so stringent that work must start now in order to reach them. Mr Morley said the government would face prosecution by the EU in 2015 if it failed to make its best efforts to reach the targets. </p> <p>Instead of merely looking at the content of the water and its quality, the whole life of the river and its catchment area must be studied, he said. This started with the quality of the groundwater that feeds the springs, and whether it was polluted because of chemicals soaking into it from farmland. </p> <p>It also dealt with such issues as whether water companies damaged river flow by abstracting too much water from the ground. Chemicals from farms and roads washed directly into rivers was another problem which the directive highlighted and those responsible would be asked to pay the cost of the damage, Mr Morley said. </p> <p>Aspects of river water quality examined will include its temperature, oxygen levels, and nutrients such as nitrogen. The river must also be studied to see what sort of life it would support if it had not been altered by man. </p> <p>A new area which the directive covers is human interference with the natural flow of rivers. Mr Morley said that where rivers had been put into concrete culverts for flood control, or otherwise changed, the reasons would have to be examined and, if necessary, the decisions reversed.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Dear George</strong> </p> <p>My argument [about climate change] . . . is based on the past record of natural climatic change, and questions how a rise in the tiny amount of carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere could have such a drastic effect when water vapour makes up some 96% of all the greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Yes, we should stop burning fossil fuels. Yes, we should stop draining peat bogs, destroying soil and natural and semi-natural vegetation. Yes, we should stop overfishing and overgrazing the planet. That is why I am still working an 18-hour day helping groups that are trying to reverse this trend, as I have been doing for the past 40 years. </p> <p>[But] why are the so-called greens backing a cartel of multinational companies which are hell bent on covering some of the best areas of our countryside with so-called wind farms, which can neither provide us with a sustainable source of future energy, nor have any measurable effect reducing the amount of carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere? If he can disprove the latter - which is the mathematical truth - I will fall into line over global warming, even if, like Galileo, I have to say \"but it moved\". <br> <em>Yours, David Bellamy</em> </p> <p><strong> Dear David</strong> </p> <p>I struggle to understand what the performance of wind farms has to do with whether or not man-made climate change is taking place. The science is now as unequivocal as the science of a complex system can be. Yet you have stated in recent months that \"the link between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming is a myth\"; that global warming is \"a problem that actually doesn't exist\"; and that \"climate change is an entirely natural phenomenon, nothing to do with the burning of fossil fuels\". Some of these statements . . . reveal that you haven't the faintest idea what you are talking about. If (as you say in the Daily Mail) you really believe that a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \"would produce a rise in plant productivity\", I can only assume that you have not read a scientific paper on this topic over the past five years. If you really believe that carbon dioxide is not an important greenhouse gas (as you also say in the Mail), you can't have read the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports or any of the thousands of papers showing the role carbon dioxide plays. </p> <p>Do you have any idea how much damage your articles and interviews have caused? Do you have any idea how your name is now being used by everyone from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders to Exxon executives to suggest that \"if even an environmentalist like David Bellamy says global warming isn't happening, then it can't be true\"? The harm you have done to environmentalism over the past few months is incalculable. May I suggest that you talk to some mainstream climatologists (not just the cranks whose work you champion) before writing any more on this topic? <br> <em>Yours, George Monbiot</em> </p> <p><strong>Dear George</strong> </p> <p>As you don't seem to have understood it, I will elaborate. At the moment, Britain has some 1,100 wind turbines doing their intermittent best producing meaningful amounts of electricity for only 24.1% of the year. Together, they produced less than four one-thousandths of the power used in the UK and saved less than one thousandth of the carbon dioxide produced by our profligate lifestyles in 2003. Please note those are mathematically provable facts from government statistics. </p> <p>There is also the fact that, however many turbines are erected, there is need for fossil-fuel back-up that must be kept in repair and in hot spinning reserve (when they work very, very efficiently), ready to cut in when the wind isn't behaving itself. </p> <p>The Germans have said that no power stations will be shut down as a result of wind power, however many turbines they erect. What is more, they have decided to replace their ageing nuclear facilities with gas-fired stations, while at the same time Tony Blair has now named three possible locations for the siting of a new nulear station, all in Scotland. </p> <p>As for the cartel, how can the so-called greens support RWE (one of the world's biggest providers of atomic power, who own Greenpeace's beloved Juice/Npower), Amec and McAlpine (haven't you railed against them in the past?). </p> <p>I would be very interested to see any of the statements regarding the use of my name by the society of motor manufacturers to Exxon. It seems very strange that these same words were used against the Conservation Foundation over 20 years ago, when we launched the Ford Conservation awards, yet we were shown no evidence. And why are they doing that when many oil companies are cashing in on the wind rush and many industries, including Caterpillar, BMW, Renault, Dublin airport, etc, are leading the way in the drive for energy efficiency and are finding it saves them lots of money? </p> <p>I must also ask, if our government is really worried about so-called people-made global warming, why are they not taxing Avigas, taking VAT off DIY insulation materials, and why are they continuing to fund the building of coal-fired power stations in the developing world, none of which are fitted with lean and clean burn technology to which we hold the patents? </p> <p>Let me reiterate. Even with our target of 25 to 30 times as much wind electricity, the proportion of global carbon dioxide emission displaced will not be enough to measurably alter the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, let alone alter climate change. <br> <em>Yours, David</em> </p> <p><strong> Dear David</strong> </p> <p>I challenged you on climate change, and again you reply with a letter about wind power. Climate change and wind power are not the same issue. Until you began your campaign to debunk the science of climate change, I had great respect for you. So did all the environmentalists I know. </p> <p>You question the notion that your public statements are being used by the corporations. As it happens, I was prompted to challenge your position after I spoke to Nigel Wonnacott, press officer at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. He cast doubt on the existence of climate change, on the grounds that you have said it's not happening. </p> <p>Now on to wind power. I'm no expert on this subject . . . but I would like to pass on some comments from the people who have read your letter: </p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Your statement: \"At the moment, Britain has 1,100 wind turbines doing their intermittent best producing meaningful amounts of electricity for only 24.1% of the year.\" Response: \"David has made this comment before - it is wrong, but it is an easy trap for people to fall into. First, a capacity factor of 24.1% has nothing to do with the amount of time the turbines are generating electricity - it is simply a measure of how much electricity they generated over the year, compared to if they had been operating at full speed all year. </p> <p>\"Second, all generators have a capacity factor less than 100% - nuclear is 76%, gas is 60%, coal is 50% - but I doubt if David would argue that nuclear 'only' produces electricity for nine months of the year, or that coal 'only' produces electricity for six months of the year. Third, the 24.1% figure is an anomalously low figure - taking an average of the last six years, the figure is around 28%, and this is without any meaningful capacity in higher wind areas, such as offshore or northern Scotland.\" </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Your statement: \"They produced less than four thousandths of the power used in the UK.\" Response: \"The figure of 'four one-thousandths' is meaningless when taken out of context - UK electricity demand in 2003 was 337TWh, of which wind supplied 1.3TWh. What isn't mentioned is that UK conventional generating capacity is almost 79,000MW, while wind generating capacity is 740MW. Exactly how much electricity demand does David think wind will satisfy when it makes up around 0.9% of generating capacity in the country?\" </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Your statement: \"However many turbines are erected, there is need for fossil fuel back-up\". Response: \"Back-up is needed because conventional generators experience breakdowns, systems go offline, plant maintenance takes longer than expected, or simply because the estimate of future demand is inaccurate. In short, the UK electricity system has never operated without fossil-fuel back-up, and this situation is going to continue indefinitely.\" </p> <p>But surely the underlying point is this: if climate change is happening, we have to find a means of doing something about it. </p> <p>Your denial of climate change relieves you of the need to engage in these dilemmas. The rest of us cannot afford this luxury. <br> <em>Yours sincerely, George</em></p> <p>For the full correspondence, see <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bellamy.org\">www.bellamy.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Your article draws comparisons between the proportion of \"state v private\" pupils who attend institutions such as the Royal Academy of Music and, say, the Wimbledon School of Art (Discordant note over 'too posh' academy, October 4). </p> <p>This argument, as postulated, is totally fatuous. Whatever the merits of schools of art, music colleges serve a totally different set of objectives - namely, the development of a cadre of professional musicians and teachers who are the equal of any in the world. As someone who has managed two great orchestras - the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields - I can say with absolute certainty that professional musicians work unbelievably hard in a high-risk environment, and for relatively poor pay. </p> <p>For this chosen career, they must practise until their fingers and lips bleed: and this, with the help of the best teaching at our conservatoires, may bring them a living. To compare this to the culture of many of the visual arts, where cutting a cow in half, or failing to make a dirty bed appears to be defined as \"art\" is simply farcical. Professional musicians have to achieve supreme technical standards and world-class excellence before their career can even begin. Of how may of our visual arts students can that be said, whatever their origin?<br><strong>John Manger</strong><br>North Hillingdon, Middx </p> <p>The problem is not just one of funding for instrumental lessons. It is a wider one and is caused by a culture which all too easily equates relatively ephemeral and/or commercially orientated music with that which has been developing for hundreds of years. This is why we have music graduates who don't know anything much about harmony and look at you blankly should you dare mention Skriabin, Alban Berg, or even (heaven forbid) Charlie Parker. </p> <p>Professor Curtis Price might be worrying about what will become of the talented young musicians still emerging from the colleges. A good many will seek employment in countries where enthusiasm and funding is undiminished, but many who elect to stay here may have a precarious future. That is because in order to flourish, music needs an audience. Sales of CDs and attendances at classical concerts are not in good shape. Why? Because the potential audiences have not been introduced to a whole area of culture which they would find enormously valuable throughout their lives.<br><strong> Christopher Gunning</strong><br>London </p> <p>Prof Curtis Price rightly states that a generation of music students has missed out, owing to the running-down of free instrument teaching in state schools. Apart from its benevolent work and further funding for postgraduate musicians, the Musicians Benevolent Fund can also help talented instrumentalists under 18 years of age. Annual awards are made for instrument purchase, and the cost of lessons or fees for study at the junior departments of the principal music colleges in the UK.<br><strong>Michael White</strong><br>Musicians Benevolent Fund<br><a href=\"http://www.mbf.org.uk\">www.mbf.org.uk</a> </p> <p>I am not surprised at the imbalance of opportunity at the Royal Academy of Music. Private schools' resourcing, through fees and charitable status, far exceeds that available for our children. As a consequence, their provision for music teaching and its costly instruments is of a nature which the majority of children can only dream about. Yet again, the dice are heavily loaded to favour those who can afford to buy privilege for their children.<br><strong>Tony P Mitchell</strong><br>Vice-chair, Socialist Educational Association</p>",
  "<p>Toytown is tottering. For 20 years Barbie Millicent Roberts, Mattel's serene Wasp from Willows, Wisconsin, has been queen of the global doll world. Two Barbies are sold each second and, if you placed all the Barbies and family bought since 1959 head to toe, they would circle planet Earth seven times. Whatever her incarnation - princess, palaeontologist, presidential candidate, paramedic - Barbie ruled.</p> <p>But an interloper has stepped in to imperil Barbie's $3.6bn annual turnover and the welfare of her 48 pets. The upstart's name is Bratz, and she is three years old. In 2003, Bratz generated $2.5bn in global revenue and last month secured 45.1% of the British fashion-doll market, making it the No1 bestseller. Barbie has fallen off her plastic throne. </p> <p>Dolls are both imago and icon for little women; they tell us what we fear, desire and, also, what we might become. And on the third floor of Hamleys in central London lies this magic looking-glass - the doll zone. I have a sudden pang for the beloved Sindy doll of my childhood and yearn for her friendly smile and her long vinyl limbs. Sindy lived in a Bishops Avenue mansion in my bedroom. She was haute bourgeoisie; she rode, she swam, she dated a man who looked like George Hamilton, and she owned a caravan. She lived the affluent life I grew up to covet and, before I chopped her head off, I adored her. But, in the doll death-match, Barbie saw off Sindy long ago. </p> <p>Barbie World stretches out before me. It is a pink purgatory, starring row upon row of Barbie's most beloved self - forever \"princess\". It's a Royal Wedding with just one guest, guarded by a Hamleys employee wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a pink princess hat. Princess Barbie is 12.5in high and smiles out of her packaging. If she were human, she would be 6ft 2in and weigh seven stone. </p> <p>Barbie was inspired by a German sex-kitten doll called Lilli. Lilli was sold to men only at tobacconists in Germany in the 1950s. But this geisha incarnation is long forgotten. Today Barbie is wearing a glittery pink gown and sitting in a peach carriage, drawn by peach horses. She clutches a dead-eyed swan. Ken stands behind her carriage, watching Barbie. He looks like Robert Kilroy-Silk in golden boots. </p> <p>I find just-married Barbie, a Vivien-Leigh-in-Gone-With-The-Wind Barbie, and even a sinister Fulham tableau starring a mumsy Barbie, a grey-haired Ken posing as an actuary, and a baby. Then come the branded tie-ins to help little girls learn to desire other corporations - a small army of Disney Barbies, Coca-Cola Barbie, Ferrari Barbie, even a Vera Wang Barbie. These more modern dolls are dissemblers: Barbie cannot hide her true nature. She is an icon of postwar American affluence and confidence. Barbie has many careers, but, if you look at her face, you know she doesn't need them. She oozes a sugary, pre-sexual revolution status quo. There is no crimson lipstick, no thigh-high boots, and certainly no fuck-me-Ken shoes. She is a smaller, less talkative Nancy Reagan. </p> <p>But Barbie World is deserted. Boxes of Barbie-branded bits (spoons, karaoke machines, skipping ropes, tissues, a Christmas tree) are piled up unsold. An Afro-Caribbean Ken has been reduced to \u00a34.99. </p> <p>I cross the plastic aisle, the Valley of the Dolls, and enter Bratz World, six feet and a social revolution away. Bratz isn't smiling out of her complex packaging, which indicates she is for the bedsides of seven to 12-year-olds. She pouts violently and with unspoken malice. Bratz is 11.5in high (one inch shorter than Barbie) and voluptuous. Were she human, she would stand 5ft 6in tall. She has an oversized head, thigh-length hair and slanting, opiate-drugged eyes. These are dolls that Martin Amis would recognise. Her lips are huge, painted and parted. </p> <p>You can take Cloe, Dana, Jade, Sasha, Yasmin, Fianna, Neura or Meygan home. These dolls are red-, brown- or indigo- haired; just one blonde glares out. Bratz are \"multi-ethnic\". There is a black Bratz, an Asian Bratz, and a Eurasian Bratz. Standing beside them are their lovers: Cade, Dylan, Eitan, Camero and Koby. I see no change in male dolls yet; these dolls are square-jawed and stereotypically handsome, just like the repulsive Ken; they are Harrison Ford before he went to seed. One has a Justin Timberlake Afro, another wears skis, and their expression, faced with a torrent of plastic promise from Meygan and friends, is bewildered. They wear Gap and Benetton-esque clothes. Ken's golf-club chic is gone. </p> <p>There is no dream castle in Bratz World, no dull and honourable marriage to Ken. These are a gang of groovy, careless singles. They party in the Bratz sushi lounge, the internet cafe and the Big Brother hot tub. They own mobile phones, plasma screens and an entire Harvey Nichols-ful of call-girl ruffs and feathers, thigh-high leopard boots, black leather miniskirts and pink silk camisoles. Bratz drink espresso and smoothies. This corner of Hamleys is a mini episode of Footballers' Wives, a plastic representation of a party at Beckingham Palace. These are dolls for children who watch television, read Heat, surf the internet and worship Britney Spears. </p> <p>I take a poll of small consumers and grinning parents. Why do they like these pouting dolls? They consider. Anisha, aged six, says, \"Bratz are pretty and they're fashionable.\" Abby, seven, likes \"to dress them up and do their hair\", while Jessica, four, thinks \"they look lovely. Shoes,\" she adds. \"Hair.\" Alice, also seven, thinks, \"Bratz look kind\". Would they buy a Barbie? \"Too babyish!\" they cry. \"Barbie is for little girls.\" How old are the Bratz? They all describe then as \"teenagers\" except Anisha, who thinks one particularly predatory-looking Bratz \"is about 12\". </p> <p>The Bratz were created by Isaac Larian, an Iranian Jew described in the toy industry as \"a charismatic entrepreneur\". Larian came to America to become a structural engineer in 1971 but instead he founded MGA, now the biggest privately owned toy company in the world. In 2000, the designer Carter Bryant walked into his California office with a drawing of a Bratz doll. Larian's seven-year-old daughter Yasmin (now immortalised as a doll) liked the drawing. Larian commissioned a prototype and the cold wind began to blow through Princess Barbie's realm. </p> <p>Why does Larian believe he has sold 80 million Bratz? First, he cites the Death of the Blonde. \"Bratz are not all blonde and busty like Barbie,\" he says. \"I decided to make Bratz multicultural. A Mexican child thinks her Bratz is Mexican, a Brazilian child thinks her Bratz is Brazilian. The multiculturalism is their magic.\" </p> <p>The second ingredient in this Willy Wonka world is the Bratz clothing. Most Barbie clothing is - and looks - cheap. Larian employs professional designers to ape the clothing children see on the Sugababes when they switch on the ubiquitous television. \"We go to fashion shows every year to identify trends and we change the clothes the dolls wear three or four times a year, just like in the full-sized fashion industry,\" says Larian, who produces his dolls in Southern China, where careful attention is paid to makeup. \"Each doll goes through 16 rotations - that is workers - just to paint the eyes.\" </p> <p>When a child is aged between four and six, he argues, \"it wants to be like its mummy. Barbie is mummy. But as they get older they want to be older and develop different role models. Children always want to become old.\" </p> <p>Esther Jones, curator at the Museum of Childhood in east London, agrees. \"Little girls always want what they can't have and don't have. These Bratz are into music and fashion and boys; for the girls who buy them, these are almost unobtainable - and yet almost there. To see Bratz as provocative is an adult interpretation. To the children, they just look attitude-y. It's a yearning for womanhood and for maturity.\" </p> <p>The UK licence to sell Bratz is held by Nick Austin of Vivid Imaginations. He talks affably and gleefully in the weird marketese that business people love about Barbie's fall. \"Barbie is struggling to stay relevant with older girls,\" he says. \"She is looking like an old, tired brand. The big-shoulder, power-dressing Barbie of California is out; the big hair, the unfeasible figure. It's anathema to today's nine-year-old.\" Austin argues that it's significant that the Bratz come with a wider range of accessories per doll. \"With Barbie you have to buy a lot separately. Ours is the more honest approach to retailing. We deliver everything in one purchase and we are following the brand consciousness of young people. We are mirroring the wider society's obsession with brands.\" </p> <p>Barbie is still the No1 brand leader globally - but she does seem to be going through a mid-life crisis. Recently Barbie dumped Ken, her 12-inch consort of 43 years, and began dating an Australian surfer called Blaine. </p> <p>Not that her people are sweating in public. Sarah Allen, public relations manager for Mattel UK, describes the fashion-doll industry as \"an evolving feast, through which trends and new fashions move\". She insists that the My Scene dolls, which appeared in 2002 and resemble Bratz very closely (except with slightly less filthy eyes), were not a response to the challenge from Bratz. \"We were working on them for some time,\" promises Allen. </p> <p>But never write off a prom queen from Wisconsin. At the moment she may be a wallflower, but Barbie is an American icon, a blonde tank wrapped, like the astronauts in Tom Wolfe's novel The Right Stuff, \"in God and flag and hearth and home\". She emerged smiling from the Totally Hair Barbie experience, when she was given a toe-length wig. She has survived an incarnation as Judy Garland, another as Cher and a spell in the US airforce. Summit Barbie partied through the end of the cold war; I know she will see the 22nd century through those cold, blue eyes. </p> <p>But for now the lipsticked juggernaut of Bratz rolls on, high-kicking in its combats and delivering irony, attitude and sex for the seven-year-old. There are 36 Bratz licences in the UK - for magazines, posters, perfume, sweets, hats, tissues, underwear, jewellery, games, socks and stickers - and an animated Bratz movie entered the shops last last month. In 2005, comes a TV series; in 2006, a live action movie. \"We want to take Bratz out of the toy aisle and into lifestyle,\" says Lisa Shapiro, who is in charge of licensing. \"We want the girls to live the Bratz life - wear the mascara; use the hair product; send the greeting card. The toy business is shrinking. Kids are getting older younger and we're losing them to clothing, computers and DVDs. If Barbie is about fantasy, then Bratz is about real life. It has to be.\" </p> <p>Parents be warned: Bratz are about to swallow your kids.</p>",
  "In this political season, where men on both sides of the Atlantic are frantically offering themselves up for public approval - a beauty contest for unlovely people - it seems right to ask: what makes a good politician? It's not a simple business. John Kerry was declared the winner of last week's TV debate not only because of his concisely expressed criticisms of the invasion of Iraq, but also because of his demeanour. He displayed that elusive, indefinable quality: he looked presidential. The timbre of his voice, his posture and bearing, gave him an aura of steady authority. George Bush, by contrast, looked tetchy - and that was when he wasn't smirking. Still, Bush has other strengths to draw on. He is so determined, so ruthless a fighter that there is almost no trick he won't pull between now and November 2 to get elected. He's proved that before - in the 2000 primaries against John McCain, the Florida stand-off that year, and the mid-term elections of 2002. The methods might have been foul - full of dishonesty, cynicism and hypocrisy - but they worked. Bush won. <p>The trouble with both these qualities - an aura of gravitas or a talent for political blood sport - is that, while either might bring you electoral success, neither ensures skill in the area that politics should be about: governing. For proof, look no further than our own country. In the brute business of politics - winning and keeping power - Tony Blair is a truly world-class performer. As a speechmaker, he gets better and better. You only had to watch Michael Howard in Bournemouth yesterday to realise how good Blair was in Brighton a week ago. He combines light and shade, switching effortlessly from soft-spoken and sincere to loud and declamatory. He seduces an audience, as if in private conversation. </p> <p>But he is not accomplished in the performance art of politics alone. His move last Thursday night - the dramatic triple announcement of cardiac surgery, a house move and a determination to stay in the job for one more term - won plaudits as a stunning piece of political footwork. He had turned a moment of vulnerability into an act of aggression, asserting his own primacy. Any circling sharks were told to withdraw their fangs for a few years at least. It's not just the little moves that Blair gets right. He's done pretty well on the big ones too. The depth of the Tories' plight, so vividly on show in Bournemouth, is very much Blair's achievement. By colonising the centre ground and beyond, he has left them homeless. </p> <p>All this is evidence of Blair's mastery of politics. The trouble is, that's not the same as an ability to govern. There, a different picture emerges. After seven and a half years in power, even Blair's admirers talk of his almost desperate search for a legacy. They concede that the large domestic achievements of this administration are associated with the Treasury rather than with him, and that little bearing the Blair stamp will endure long after he has gone. Even the big constitutional changes - devolution to Scotland and Wales - are attributed more to his predecessor than to him. </p> <p>The problems he defined in opposition have persisted, or at least that is the impression he gives. His constant talk of reform of the public services implies that the public services are broken and need fixing. Judged by his own rhetoric, he has failed the big domestic tests he set for himself. Those decisions with which Blair is intimately associated tend to be unhappy ones. In the innocent days of the 2001 election, it was the Dome that he could not quite shake off. Next time it will be the much graver matter of Iraq. </p> <p>Put simply, Blair may one day be viewed as a first-class politician whose record in government was not in the same league. The contrasting figure is Gordon Brown. His record in government is gargantuan: a stable, record-breaking economy; a minimum wage; action on child poverty; a move to full employment; unprecedented investment in public services, blessed by the public; and a war on global debt. Yet his record in politics does not look quite so accomplished. Of course, it's a major achievement to have stayed in the exchequer as long as he has - most have failed to hold on - and to have retained the electorate's support throughout. Labour's private polling has Brown's trust-rating around plus-65, while Blair's languishes around minus-20. But in the cruel game of politics, there is only one measure that counts - and that is winning the big prize. </p> <p>On this test, Brown has shown none of the ruthless skill of his neighbour. In November 2003, Blair promised he would stand down a year later in Brown's favour - so long as Brown helped him through the period ahead, allowing Blair to make a graceful exit. He had to get through Hutton and Iraqi reconstruction, and wanted a couple of domestic achievements. Brown duly cooperated - pulling the plug on a backbench tuition fees revolt which might have proved terminal to Blair, offering a public defence of the Iraq policy and even shelving his own misgivings on foundation hospitals and the like. </p> <p>Blair pocketed all that help, got through the year - and then promptly announced the deal was off. As an act of political betrayal, it has few rivals. (And now the Blairites have the chutzpah to say it was Brown who reneged on the deal - a deal which, they hastily add, did not exist!) Express dismay at this treachery and Blair's defenders will only redouble their admiration. As one put it to me: \"That's showbiz.\" In other words, politics is a tough game and Brown has simply not proved tough enough for it. Good at governing he might be, but as a practitioner of the blood sport he's not quite top-notch. He lacks the killer instinct. </p> <p>Yet this story may end in a twist. For what if Blair's skill was not so much in politics, as in short-term politics? Last week's move certainly brought a good instant hit on the TV news, swapping negative for positive coverage. But the after-effects of pre-announcing his own eventual resignation have not been good, even for Blair himself. Cartoonists are already depicting the prime minister as a lame duck. Drawing up the manifesto will be \"impossible\", says one insider, as former colleagues see each other as rivals in a now-declared leadership contest and position themselves accordingly. Rather than a smooth transition, which would have safeguarded his legacy, Blair has ensured a dogfight which could imperil it.</p> <p>Brown's long game, by contrast, might pay off. Trusted by the public, eschewing the short-term, quick hits of his neighbour, he remains the natural inheritor when the arrangement announced last week finally breaks down - as surely it will.</p> <p>There is a touch of the tortoise and the hare about this story. Until now, Blair's darting and weaving has kept him ahead, while Brown's steady plodding has held him in perennial second place. If Brown prevails, he would prove that government and politics are not different disciplines after all, that to succeed in one brings rewards in the other - eventually.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Kodak, the American photographic equipment manufacturer, has angered trade unions by unveiling plans to cut 600 jobs in Britain and close a factory in Nottingham. </p> <p>The move comes only a month after the British arm of a rival, Ilford Imaging, slipped into administration with the loss of hundreds of jobs. </p> <p>Both companies have blamed the same pressures of a consumer switch from traditional film to digital cameras. </p> <p>Kodak plans to shut its photographic film-finishing plant at Annesley, Nottinghamshire, with the loss of 350 jobs and axe a further 250 positions by closing part of its operations in Harrow, north-west London. </p> <p>The company intends to move more than 300 jobs from its headquarters at Hemel Hempstead to Harrow, which will become its new base in this country. </p> <p>Peter Blackwell, Kodak's UK managing director, said there was a \"fundamental shift in customer and consumer behaviour\" that made a restructuring vital. </p> <p>\"These have been difficult decisions to take and no reflection on the highly valued work performed by our employees,\" he added. </p> <p>However, trade unions in Britain expressed frustration at the plans and threatened to oppose them. Joe McGowan, a regional officer of the manufacturing union Amicus, said: \"Amicus does not accept the economic rationale behind the decision to announce 600 job losses and the closure of the Annesley site. </p> <p>\"This is another blow to UK manufacturing; we will be demanding no compulsory redundancies and for the com pany to reconsider their decision to close the Annesley site.\" </p> <p>The cuts are part of a wider global restructuring programme by Kodak that will affect up to 15,000 staff. </p> <p>The company said its Easyshare photo printers, which allow people to develop digital photographs at home, had \"taken the snapshot photo printing market by storm\". </p> <p>Kodak also produces the Picture Maker Kiosks, which allow customers to print digital pictures from cameras or mobile phones at retailers. </p> <p>More than 740 people were employed at the Ilford site in Cheshire, which was controlled by the private equity firm Doughty Hanson. This business is now in the hands of of accountants Grant Thornton, which has laid off half of the workforce as it restructures the business ahead of a possible sale.</p>",
  "Tony Blair's declaration that he intends to serve another full term accentuates the constitutional crisis now building in Britain - the growing belief that all the normal checks and balances have broken down and the country's leadership seems unaccountable and uncontrollable. <p>There are several factors feeding this despair: massaged intelligence; decision-making confined to a tiny non-elected coterie around the prime minister; and neither parliament nor the electorate able to secure a change in policy. Although discussion may take place on public platforms and in some of the media, the government shows no sign of listening. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, this has generated great frustration and anger, but it has not had any decisive effect because all the constraining elements in the power structure have been stymied. Parliament is hamstrung by the government's huge majority, enforced by a mixture of patronage and rigid discipline. No objection was raised even when the sole debate on the crisis in Iraq since the so-called end of the war was staged by the government without a substantive motion, and therefore with no vote at the end. </p> <p>Pressures from within the Labour party have been deflected because the national executive committee, the parliamentary party, the trade unions and the annual conference have all either had their composition weakened or their role largely marginalised. Even a leadership challenge is problematic under internal Labour rules. Not only is a challenger required to obtain the openly declared signatures of a fifth (83) of Labour MPs, but consent to an election could still be withheld if half the delegates to party conference did not agree. </p> <p> We not only need a radical strengthening of parliament's holding the executive to account but also, even more important, new forms of direct democracy involving the electorate. </p> <p>In parliament, we need a fully elected second chamber - perhaps based on regional representation - in order to secure a more democratic determination of policy than a whipped programme handed down from above without genuine consultation. We need cabinet appointments to be ratified at a public hearing of the appropriate select committee before they can come into effect, so that the principle of joint accountability to both prime minister and parliament is established, with the option of recall by either where justified. </p> <p>We need the appointment of the chair and members of specialist committees of inquiry (such as Hutton and Butler), and their terms of reference, to require approval by the relevant select committee. And we need the members of these revamped committees to be elected - in quotas reflecting the balance between the parties in the Commons - by MPs of each party in a secret ballot. If introduced, these measures would greatly strengthen parliament in checking the centralisation of power in the executive. </p> <p>But the democratic deficit will not be met without wider reform. Turnout at elections is steadily declining because people feel that one vote every 4-5 years gives them no influence over major events - foundation hospitals, top-up fees, GM crops, war in Iraq, to name just some. </p> <p>Bills, instead of being hammered through parliament on a whipped vote, should be examined first by a Commons committee in televised sessions, with specialist witnesses. Interested electors could then offer online comments, to be fed into the parliamentary process. </p> <p>Even more important is to draw on best democratic experience from abroad. In Switzerland, for example, citizens have a right to call a referendum on any issue they like, so long as they gather enough signatures. Indeed, any new law brought before the Swiss parliament can be challenged by the voters before it is enacted. If 1% of the population sign up to a proposal within an 18-month period, it can be voted on by the public and, if passed, become law. This really is direct democracy in action.</p> <p>Suppose, more modestly, we were to require a 5% threshold: that would require nearly 2 million people to sign up - an exacting demand, but by no means a prohibitive one. It would radically transform our politics.</p> <p>Of course there is a risk, with inflammatory tabloid headlines, that law-making could be too influenced by emotions rather than reasoned judgments. But a delay before a referendum could be held would allow tempers to cool. What is needed is a public debate about the pros and cons of referendums, which would enable us to achieve a real element of direct democracy while minimising any unintended misuses. If we could get that balance, it would re-engage public involvement in the big decisions, make politics meaningful beyond one vote every five years and, as a last resort, hold government leaders to account when all else fails. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:massonm@parliament.uk\">Michael Meacher</a> is Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton; he was environment minister 1997-2003</p>"
