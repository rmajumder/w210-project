  "<p>And now for Ucas - the Movie. Or at least, Ucas the soap opera. This week, UK vice-chancellors gathering in Oxford for their annual conference will hear plans for a television channel dedicated to choosing a university.</p> <p>If the idea of 16- and 17-year olds sitting down to watch TV before entering the labyrinth of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service seems bizarre, the promoters of University Choice TV believe this is an idea whose time has come.</p> <p>They are busy raising around \u00a32m to get their digital channel off the ground, and it's not a charity.</p> <p>With university heads now preoccupied with the impact of tuition fees on their recruitment - some are worried about attracting enough students, others about how they can satisfy the government's demands to broaden access to students from poor families and ethnic minorities - entrepreneurs Shaie Selzer and Michael Kesztenbaum believe they can get enough universities on board to make their venture fly, although they have not been endorsed by Universities UK, which represents all the vice-chancellors.</p> <p>They plan to go on air from September 2005 with a digital channel on which universities will pay between \u00a3200 and \u00a3400 to broadcast their pitches to prospective students. The channel will carry general programmes about going to university and student finance as well as films made by individual institutions or groups wanting to promote a specific subject like engineering. The schedule will be organised regionally and rotated - there will be no primetime slot to be monopolised by a few institutions - and no one university will find itself competing with EastEnders every week.</p> <p>Sir Graeme Davies, vice-chancellor of the University of London, who chairs the company's board, was persuaded the idea was a runner by the figures for satellite television, showing that viewers were more likely to be from low-income groups and ethnic minorities - the groups higher education is desperate to reach out to.</p> <p>The Schwartz report on access today could hardly have been better timed for the channel's promoters.</p> <p>More than 50% of UK households have digital TV but that rises to 75% of households that have 16- to 18-year olds, says Selzer, who is confident that three out of four of the age group will thus be able to watch their channel via Sky. The channel will also be available as a broadband service, tapping into the 4 million broadband subscribers in the UK.</p> <p>Sir Graeme adds: \"It's a route to the part of the potential student population who are difficult to get to. It's as near a magic bullet as you can get.\"</p> <p>Plenty of universities already have promotional videos but the quality, as Selzer tactfully puts it, is mixed. Part of the channel's role will be to introduce universities and film-makers to each other. And, as he says, they have to make the channel watchable.</p> <p>The funding council has already put up money for a review of current video offerings from universities, which will serve as a starting point and identify the best ones in the field for other institutions to emulate.</p> <p>Goldsmiths College, University of London, is reputed to have one of the best - its 12-minute video made in 2001 by students and recent graduates won a silver medal from the US-based Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (Case) and the revised version won a gold medal this year. There was also a bronze award from the International Visual Communication Association (Ivca), which hands out gongs to a much wider range of business media.</p> <p>But more gratifying than medals for Goldsmiths were the comments from year 11 students (16-year-olds) who have seen the video. \"It was pretty laid back, arty and cool ... I liked the camerawork a lot ... honest and gritty with the students' personal views ... raised issues like the first day, which are of concern ... good to show samples of actual classes in action ... students seem to tell the truth ... inspired lecturers ... diverse university with cultures and ethnicities ... welcoming environment ... friendly people ... it made me feel I could fit in.\"</p> <p>Goldsmiths, which has a reputation for arts and media, has also been paid the compliment of being imitated by other universities with its attempt to get away from the \"talking vice-chancellor\" style of video. \"Next time round we will look at a complete reshooting. We've noticed a few people have nicked our ideas. We want to keep it ahead of the game,\" said a spokeswoman. Three years ago, people were not thinking in terms of DVDs, but that looks an obvious omission now.</p> <p>The video with a gentle musical track - laid back or dull, depending on your taste - shows glimpses of the university's departments and impressions in students' own unscripted words. Actually the student I happened to watch it with found it pretty dull and was irritated by the lack of useful information it conveyed, but then he already knows what being at university is like and the video is presumably aimed at an age group with little idea - and perhaps false impressions - of what to expect, or what range of things they can study.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see if universities can tap into their students' creativity when it comes to making items for the new channel.</p> <p>Even so, it is hard to imagine anyone watching much of this sort of thing at a time. Selzer, however, is convinced UCTV will fit the channel-flicking habits of teenagers who have music, TV and computer going at the same time.</p> <p>He says UCTV will bring open days into the homes of university entrants in a way not possible through a website or prospectus. \"Typically, students base their decision on information from prospectuses, websites, and hearsay. There is no guarantee that schools will give good advice, and applicants will typically attend only one or two open days.\"</p> <p>The channel is promoting itself not only as a means for universities and colleges to reach a million potential entrants but for subjects struggling to recruit students to make their case as well. Physics, engineering and modern languages could all benefit from a bit of positive publicity, a point picked up by Sir Graeme and also by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce).</p> <p>But the biggest attraction for many universities is the hope of reaching disaffected 16-year-olds and teenagers who just don't consider that higher education is something for them. Selzer will emphasise the point this week when he talks to vice-chancellors in the Victorian setting of Keble College, Oxford. \"With almost 50% of young people applying to university, many families have no experience of the sector,\" says Selzer. \"The demographics of digital television are ideal for reaching these sections of the population. In particular, UCTV is well placed to recruit students from ethnic minorities, as digital television is the principal source of special-interest programmes for these groups.\"</p> <p>Market research by NOP for the company suggests nearly half of 15- to 19-year-olds would be very or quite interested in getting information on colleges and universities via television but this rose to over 50% among 15- to 17-year-olds, the real target audience. On a class breakdown of the survey, it was the C2 youngsters who were most interested in receiving this information from television.</p> <p>Here Selzer and Kesztenbaum seem to have struck lucky, launching just at a time when the government is giving universities special funds to promote wider access. To their delight, Hefce has confirmed that this money may be spent on videos and broadcasts.</p> <p>John Rushforth, director of widening participation at Hefce, has written to Selzer. \"We see universities or colleges which elect to represent their institutions on this channel as adopting a specific measure designed to increase their effectiveness in widening participation, thereby attracting students from groups that had hitherto been under-represented within higher education ... Any institution could choose to use part of the funds we allocate for widening participation funds for this purpose.\"</p> <p>So if teenagers can be tempted to watch UCTV that could well keep the new watchdog, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), from the door of Oxbridge and other Russell group institutions with an embarrassing lack of working- class applicants.</p> <p>Sir David Watson, vice-chancellor of Brighton, is a member of UCTV's advisory board and calls the channel a clever idea. \"The bottom line is the relationship between late teenagers and the screen. They are the screen-age generation. They are hooked on MTV. If we could get a message inserted somewhere in there, there are lots of institutions with high-quality video and film records of what they do.\"</p> <p>Brighton is currently trawling through film and video footage of student activities, particularly in the creative arts and sport, as the basis for material to broadcast.</p> <p>Promotional videos are, of course, only a small part of the task facing British universities in the dawning era of variable undergraduate fees, which will be discussed at the Universities UK conference this week. Pricing will be crucial in some cases, even if the majority of institutions are publicly intent on showing they could charge top rate. But frank discussion here will be inhibited by the rules on cartel price-fixing that have already prompted an investigation into possible collusion between independent schools.</p> <p>More pressing concerns about what happens to the universities' share of funds in the government's spending review will be aired more frankly. Has the departing higher education minister, Alan Johnson, left negotiations with the Treasury in good shape? His old boss, the education secretary, Charles Clarke, will be there to address them but will not be in a position to reveal much about the spending review.</p> <p>But one aspect of this week's conference is clear: it won't feature in a promotional video. That would be a challenge too far for the most adventurous film-maker.</p>",
  "It is the end of the first ever lunch break at the gleaming new Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, east London, and more than 200 11-year-olds are standing silently in lines beside the netball courts. <p>\"Bags off your back and on the floor; leather school shoes on,\" commands a teacher as the pupils shuffle slightly in their oversize grey blazers with red ribbon trim. There is a brief pause and then each class files wordlessly along the school's covered cloisters (there are no corridors at Mossbourne - they are havens for unruliness and bullying) and into one of the school's \"terraced house-style\" learning areas to complete the first day of the new term. </p> <p>Mossbourne, it does not require a proud education minister to point out, is very new, very ambitious and very different from your average secondary, from the glass roof of its \u00a3325m timber and glass Richard Rogers Partnership-designed building to the state-of-the-art computer \"clusters\" located on the ground floor of each learning area (not forgetting the River Cafe-supervised school dinners and planned organic kitchen garden designed by Jamie Oliver). </p> <p>In a borough where multifarious social challenges combined with town hall ineffectiveness and mismanagement on an epic scale have led to a disastrous educational record, the academy is charged with proving that Britain's inner cities can offer high quality, well-resourced state education to children of all abilities, including the offspring of the middle class parents who currently desert Hackney in droves in search of better schools. </p> <p>Mossbourne, oversubscribed this year, belongs to the government's flagship programme of academies - state schools funded partly through private sponsorship and granted freedoms to innovate and experiment in an effort to raise standards, particularly in deprived areas. </p> <p>Five schools opening this term bring the total to 17 nationally, with a government goal of 200 academies by 2010 under a rapid expansion ordered by Downing Street but questioned by some critics concerned that the fledgling and expensive programme has yet to prove its success. </p> <p>Pacing a playground still faintly bearing the tracks of builders' machinery and overlooked by the school's two giant three-storey \"wings\", Mossbourne's principal, Sir Michael Wilshaw, (the knighthood rewarded services to education) acknowledges that the pressure is great, nationally as much as locally, to ensure that the academy succeeds. </p> <p>\"This is more than just another school in Hackney: it is a symbolic school, an emblem, saying these places should be where children from all backgrounds in inner city areas should come and be successful.\" </p> <p>Adding to the symbolism is the academy's location, on the crushed rubble of the old Hackney Downs school, decreed a failure and closed seven years ago, yet once one of the top grammars in the country and boasting old boys including Harold Pinter and Michael Caine. </p> <p>Whatever their social background, all concerned parents have the same fundamental requirements of a school, Sir Michael argues. They want good results, a sense that their child's individual needs will be identified and met, and - crucially - a safe environment, free from bullying and disruptive or dangerous behaviour. </p> <p>The school, forming a wide V shape with its windowless soundproof back to two noisy railway lines and its mainly glass front overlooking the triangular \"social area\" and the grassy expanse of Hackney Downs, has been designed according to the principal's requirements to minimise behavioural problems. </p> <p>From his glass fronted office, the principal can survey the entire playground, as well as the school's approach road and the downs. When changing lessons, pupils do not rush down internal corridors but must leave by the front door of one learning area and walk along the cloister to the next. </p> <p>\"I want to supervise these children at all times,\" says Sir Michael, who made his educational name revolutionising the educational performance of St Bonaventure's in nearby Newham. \"I can stand here [in the playground] and see their progress around the school clearly.\" </p> <p>The controlled approach extends to discipline and general behaviour, though with only 11-year-olds in the school so far - the academy will fill up year by year - the silent post-lunch break line-up feels almost eerily orderly. Later, as Sir Michael, a calm but commanding figure with a chief executive's air and wide pinstripe suit, enters one of the technology \"clusters\" where pupils sit in a three storey atrium beneath white cafe-style umbrellas, most of the youngsters remember to stand up, as they must, whenever a teacher enters a classroom. </p> <p>Today, on day two of their Mossbourne careers, the academy's pupils will be divided into sets for all main curriculum subjects, based on the tests each of 600 applicants sat before being banded and selected to engineer a cross section of ability. </p> <p>The ability mix, says Sir Michael, is crucial if the academy is to succeed. \"I wanted to ensure a balanced intake. We don't want a secondary modern school, we want a comprehensive school.\" </p> <p>A sophisticated continuous assessment system, with catch-up classes for weak areas and extension classes to build on strengths, will ensure that each pupil - including black boys, so often let down by the education system - is stretched, he argues. \"My aim is to get children here to university and Oxbridge, as well as developing those who won't take academic routes.\" </p> <p>Mossbourne's fate will depend on the confidence it inspires in parents, and particularly the middle classes, as a genuinely different type of school which is more than a very stylish building. If it could ensure its success by sheer force of will, and some confident self-promotion, then its chances, even in a traditionally under-achieving area, are strong. </p> <p>A sponsor, Clive Bourne, an engaging Hackney-born businessman who put \u00a32m and apparently endless effort into ensuring that the academy opened its doors this term, argues it will become a blueprint for all future schools in Britain. Nibbling a River Cafe-influenced salad and grinning broadly yesterday, he pronounced: \"All schools should be like this.\"</p>",
  "<p>Skills shortages and the government's determination to encourage cutting-edge science are exerting a major influence on how the UK's \u00a31.3bn research funding is spent. Any hopeful postgraduate researcher needs to be aware of these funding priorities. Whilst research councils have been given more money by the government, there are still many more projects coming forward than can possibly be funded.</p> <p>Last year, for example, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) received 4,248 applications for research grants of which 1,345 were funded to a total of \u00a3330m. Quite often differences in quality can be minuscule and decisions all the harder to reach. Lesley Lilley of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) says: \"Out of the 772 applications we received 630 that were alpha rated but only 267 could be funded. A success rate of one in three applications is widely accepted as the norm.\"</p> <p>What factors will give a postgraduate's funding application the edge? Analysing projects approved by the research councils, common threads emerge. Research is concentrated in new technologies that enhance national competitiveness, generate wealth and contribute to quality of life. EPSRC, for example, is committed to knowledge transfer partnerships between universities and the private sector. Manufacturing technology in Scotland was boosted recently by \u00a34.2m EPSRC-funded Scottish Manufacturing Institute at Herriot Watt University designed to apply research in photonics (laser sensors), microsystems assembly and digital tools for manufacture. Collaborative research with industry accounts for around 40% of EPSRC's research portfolio.</p> <p>The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council's (BBSRC's) four priority funding areas - the interface between biological science and physics, maths and engineering, infectious diseases in animals, whole organism physiology and stem cell research - are aimed at closing worrying gaps. Events such as the catastrophic foot and mouth epidemic as well as the rise in variant CJD have drawn attention to research weaknesses, while medical research needs more researchers with the mathematical and computing skills to analyse gene sequences.</p> <p>At the Medical Research Council (MRC), a major priority is equal access to facilities - the politics and demography of healthcare. The Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc) is concerned, among other things, with investigating links between soil structure and soil erosion and major catastrophic events such as mudslides, while at Imperial College the EPSRC is funding a mathematical modelling project that could give early warning of volcanic eruptions.</p> <p>Many projects are jointly funded so that overlapping areas of research do not fall through the gaps. EPSRC is one of several research councils to fund Case awards (Collaborative awards for science and engineering). MRC plays a big role in funding bioscience research along with the BBSRC - quite often there is a thin dividing line between, say, stem cell research to advance understanding of organisms and clinical applications.</p> <p>One highly successful project working at the boundaries of medicine and engineering is the EPSRC-funded researchers at the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering who have developed electronic sensors linked to a warning device that can alert elderly sufferers of dementia to hazards in the home.</p> <p>Dr Ian Lyne, BBSRC's head of postgraduate training and fellowships, says: \"Quite a number of universities have significant biological representation but you will find our studentships scattered throughout other departments as joint research breaks down traditional barriers. Bio-informatics - DNA analysis and sequencing of genomes - could be going on in a computer science department.\"</p> <p>The trend towards multidisciplinary research and mathematics and engineering in particular is evolving to embrace medicine, biosciences and the environment. So much so that Nerc acknowledges difficulties in recruiting maths graduates. Judy Parker, business manager for Nerc, says: \"We need more researchers capable of mathematical applications such as climatechange modelling.\"</p> <p>Nerc has just undertaken its biggest funding review and, as a result, is expected to adjust the balance of funding in favour of PhD students and postdoctoral fellowships.</p> <p>The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) operates three sites, the UK astronomy technology centre in Edinburgh, the Isaac Newton group in Las Palmas and the joint astronomy centre in Hawaii, besides being responsible for space.</p> <p>The loss of the Beagle 2 on its mission to Mars last Christmas was a disappointment for researchers but the agency is a partner in the European Space Agency's Lisa project, a precursor to the first space-based gravitational wave observatory, so there are still opportunities for space scientists.</p> <p>PPARC funds the UK's involvement with the Cern project in Geneva, the world's largest circular Hadron particle collider. The agency is ramping up its funding for a global collaborative science project to build an even bigger linear electron-positron particle collider that will advance the science of the exploration of sub-atomic particles. The data pouring out of these experiments are like gold dust for scientists in the field.</p> <p>Research money follows success. Iain Cameron, head of postgraduate training at EPSRC, says: \"What we want to see is people being trained in a good academic environment.\" The council backs institutions with a proven track record and where the majority of PhD students successfully stay the course.</p> <p>Students worrying about how to apply for research funding need to recognise that science research councils deliver the bulk of their funding direct to universities, which are then held accountable for distributing it. For their part, the research councils have used their influence to boost the maintenance grant element of their funding and aim to continue to advance the pay of postdoctoral researchers ahead of inflation. The additional tax-free grant, which has risen from around \u00a38,000 a year to over \u00a310,000, is in response to the findings of the Roberts Review in 2002, which described an urgent need to build capacity in science and engineering.</p> <p>The research councils allow universities a certain leeway in how to allocate the increased funds. One way of achieving this has been through the introduction of flexible four-year doctoral training accounts in which stipends are available over a longer period - enabling students to complete their PhDs free of financial worry. The stipend, which is over and above the tuition fees that are paid direct to institutions, represents a real rise and is aimed at slowing the brain drain of top graduates to the City where scientists, engineers and mathematicians - numerate problem solvers - are in high demand.</p> <p>Cameron says: \"Our studentships from 2004 is going to be \u00a312,000 per annum. Tax free, that is the equivalent of an \u00a318,000 starting salary and it will not trigger student loan repayments.\" Despite funding priorities, student preference still counts for a lot. Dawn Duncan at the MRC comments: \"The shift towards post-doctoral training accounts is aimed at giving the maximum opportunities for researchers to produce something of value and move their careers on.\" BBSRC's Ian Lyne concludes: \"There's no better time to be going into research.\"</p> <p><strong>Tips to success</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Get sound advice. Dr Ian Lyne of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council says: \"We advise students to talk to their own tutor first about what research opportunities are available.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Make sure you apply to a research department with a proven track record of academic excellence. \"We allocate our studentships according to a range of issues,\" says Lyne. \"We put money into university departments that have a strong training environment and a good supportive structure for PhD students to work within.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Make sure your project has a strong grounding in theory yet has a practical or commercial application. Dawn Duncan of the Medical Research Council says: \"If your proposal is of high quality, is feasible science and is relevant to human health we will approve it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Since the vast majority of research projects are sponsored by universities make sure your application fits in with the work of your chosen department. Duncan observes: \"If a student is working within a university department their application has got to be fundamental to the group they are working with.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Originality never fails to impress. \"In preparing a PhD thesis a student must be able to prove a real contribution to knowledge,\" says Lyne. \"Often research will contribute to an ongoing project with the hope that it can develop into a significant breakthrough. This is what excites and motivates.\"</p> <p><strong>Bodies of research</strong></p> <p><strong>Research Councils UK (RCUK)</strong><br> Strategic partnership set up to champion science, engineering and technology and to provide a common framework for research, training and knowledge transfer.

  "<p>What do Sven Goran Eriksson, Bill Sweetnam and Duncan Fletcher have in common? They are all high-profile British sports coaches, and yet none of them actually hails from these shores. England football coach Eriksson is this country's most notorious Swede; Sweetnam is Team GB's Australian swimming coach and Zimbabwean Fletcher is credited with putting the English cricket team back at or near the top.</p> <p>Each sport's governing body naturally looks for the best coaches and our record at the Olympics - we came back with 30 medals - shows that shopping overseas pays off. But there remains a nagging doubt that goes all the way to Whitehall and it is this: that it would be preferable, especially given the possibility of a London Olympics in 2012, to have home-grown coaches to train British athletes.</p> <p>But where to find these coaches? Especially in the more obscure sports such as orienteering or archery, the question arises: who writes the courses and where do we find the trainers and assessors? In an education system where academia has always taken priority, the governing bodies of different sports frequently struggle to find the quality of coaches they require.</p> <p>But times are changing. In 2002, the government announced its Coaching Project Initiative, which includes a \u00a328m package of investment into sport with the recruitment of 45 coach development officers and 3,000 community sports coaches by the end of 2006.</p> <p>Those in the know say there has never been a better time to get into coaching.</p> <p>\"By becoming a coach you have the satisfaction of improving an athlete's performance and knowing you've had an impact,\" says Melanie Parker, head of communications at the charity Sports Coach UK. \"You're out there dealing with people, playing the sport, getting involved. It's a great way to spend your time.\"</p> <p>So how would you go about it?</p> <p>\"The way to become a coach is to go to the governing body of that sport and do one of their coaching qualifications,\" says Parker. \"They will have their own qualifications and will advise you on the best place to start.\"</p> <p>Many, but not all, sports use national vocational qualifications, or NVQs, to assess their coaches, the standards for which are set by SkillsActive, the sector skills council for sports. NVQs are divided into five levels, according to how advanced the student wants to become.</p> <p>John Thorpe, the head of technical standards at SkillsActive, says: \"The Coaching, Teaching and Instructing NVQ is based on generic standards we draw up, which are the same for all sports. The concept of the NVQ is that it describes competencies. At level 2 for instance, the candidate is required to be able to plan and prepare a series of sessions and to be able to evaluate those sessions. They will also be required to maintain an environment in which participants can improve their performance and to be able to effectively coach participants to improve their performance. They will also need to know how to deal with accidents and emergencies.</p> <p>\"Each sport's governing body will use these standard competencies and then slot the specific requirements of their sport into each of them.\"</p> <p>For many of the UK's estimated 80 sports bodies, the system works well.</p> <p>Chris Hatton was just 18 and ranked among the top 15 swimmers in the UK when a back injury put paid to a career in the water. Keen to stay involved in the sport, Chris decided to train as a coach. Now 23, he has just completed his NVQ level 3 through the Amateur Swimmers' Association.</p> <p>\"I knew I wanted to stay in the sport and I am now a qualified swimming club coach,\" says Chris from Chelmsford in Essex. \"I teach at my old club, Thurrock swimming club, and also at local schools. The NVQ tested me in practical coaching techniques and land conditioning, which is weights work and fitness. I also did a written exam and completed a logbook in which you record your experiences in things like psychological tests on athletes and their physical condition, such as testing their heart rate and pulse and assessing their diet. All this then gets assessed by your tutor. I thought it was a great system.\"</p> <p>The good thing about the coaching NVQ is that it sets a national standard, regardless of which sport it is taken in. People hiring coaches with NVQ to level 2, for example, will know that, in accordance with the framework set out by SkillsActive, their new employees have had adequate experience to be able to coach an individual or group unaided.</p> <p>The logbook format requires candidates to undergo continual assessment, which means an employer can be confident that their coaches will have had extensive \"field\" experience of their topic, rather than having done a 10-day classroom-based course, for example.</p> <p>Yet some sports governing bodies see the logbook as an excessive bind involving a lot of administration, paperwork and costs.</p> <p>\"Don't even get me started on the NVQ,\" says Anne Baker, the national development manager at England Hockey, the sport's governing body. \"Although it means coaches can be assessed using external criteria, the paperwork is excessive. The NVQ is great for a work-based subject such as engineering, where the candidate can work on their logbook every day, but it is almost untenable in sport, where many of our coaches are volunteers and just don't have the time or the inclination to fill out vast reams of paperwork. You also have to find and train the tutors, which is time-consuming and expensive.\"</p> <p>Hockey England, along with 22 other sports governing bodies, is now involved in developing the UK Coaching Certificate - one of the initiatives that came out of the government's \u00a328m package. The certificate criteria will be designed so that each sport can define what is important for its coaches - for example, physiology is an essential component for swimming coaches but arguably less important in, say, archery - but will still have factors common to all sports so that a cross-industry standard is maintained.</p> <p>Last week, a survey by Sports Coach UK found that there are now 1.2 million people involved in coaching at all standards across the UK.</p> <p>Responding to the survey, Richard Caborn, minister for sport, said: \"The coaching figures are really positive and reflect the interest that exists across the nation in getting involved in sport through coaching. Coaches are crucial for sport at all levels, from the school pitch to major international teams. They are the people who motivate, encourage and inspire.</p> <p>\"With concrete evidence that so many are involved in coaching, we can build on the UK Coaching Certificate initiative and encourage even more people to get involved and increase the percentage of people coaching who hold a recognised qualification.\"</p>",
  "The Korean peninsula is probably the most dangerous place on earth, made worse by those who extrapolate dodgy intelligence to fanciful \"worst-case\" scenarios that become the sand on which policy is founded. <p>In reality, Europe being threatened by North Korea's nuclear missiles is about as likely as the Pope converting to Islam. The most \"pessimistic\" estimated range of Pyongyang's projected Taepodong 2 missile would fall well short. Even concerns over last week's \"mushroom cloud\" in the north-east were quickly dismissed by the US and South Korea. </p> <p>The truth is that North Korea is changing: it wants to come in from the cold. A country seen by many as the final remnant of the cold war is trying to transform itself, driven by need, and necessity to embrace the market. These steps signify a willingness for engagement not seen before, but they have been overshadowed by the \"nuclear crisis\" triggered in October 2002 when Pyongyang admitted to having the \"know-how\", but not the technology, for a highly enriched uranium route to nuclear weapons. </p> <p>In fact, North Korea didn't trust the US to keep to the 1994 framework agreement which promised - in exchange for the freezing and dismantling of its Russian-designed reactors capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium - a lifting of the 50-year economic embargo; normalisation of relations; a formal commitment not to use nuclear weapons against North Korea; two proliferation-resistant nuclear reactors; and an interim supply of oil. </p> <p>Pyongyang had a point. The US negotiators in 1994 were confident that after the collapse of the Soviet empire, North Korea was sure to follow. They failed to take into account that, in contrast to central and eastern Europe, North Korea's was an indigenous regime rooted in the country's history and culture. </p> <p>Now, the revelation that Seoul had its own clandestine nuclear programme, which went further than the one Pyongyang has admitted, undermines the US's righteous indignation. On top of that, North Korea's military budget is a quarter of Seoul's. South Korea spends more on defence each year than the North's entire GDP. </p> <p>In the 90s, North Korea suffered badly from a series of natural and man-made disasters, including droughts and floods, and from Russia and China switching from friendship prices and counter trade to demanding pre-payment in hard currency. Starvation killed up to 3 million people, one in eight of the population. Substantial humanitarian aid slowly stabilised the situation. The World Food Programme now estimates that \"only\" 250,000 children under six are suffering from chronic malnutrition, which will leave them stunted and brain damaged, while a million are badly malnourished. Again this year, there will be a 20% shortfall of cereals: 1m tonnes. </p> <p>It took a while, but in July 2002 North Korea embraced the market. Salaries were increased 18 fold, food prices 26 fold, and the exchange rate for the euro - Pyongyang's official currency for foreign exchange transactions - 70 fold. Farmers were set attainable targets for food delivery to the state, with the surplus allowed to be sold in new markets set up around the country. As the vice-minister of state planning, Pak Chang-ryun, said: \"It has worked better than fertiliser in improving productivity.\" </p> <p>Last month North Korea went a step further, acknowledging that central planning must be curtailed because it loses local knowledge and undermines creativity. In future, factories will be set financial targets. Managers will be able to hire and fire at will, and choose what to produce and how much to charge. </p> <p>The new markets are flourishing. Crowds are buying everything from Spanish oranges to ice-cream makers. But rice price inflation is running at 400-500% per annum. Despite the people's distribution service delivering about 50% of daily needs at hugely subsidised prices, up to 5 million people no longer earn enough to feed themselves. The problem is particularly acute in the heavily industrialised north-eastern cities, where few factories are working and access to homegrown food or humanitarian aid is limited. A new rich class is emerging, and they are beginning to appropriate what little is available. </p> <p>Freeing the farmers to go to the market is having an impact on productivity, despite inflation. However, the same is not true in the manufacturing sector, where the boost in demand is merely sucking in imports. Without development aid to kick-start the economy, the situation will not change. North Korea, once a developed country with 70% of the workforce in manufacturing, is experiencing a reruralisation of the economy, with factory managers laying off industrial workers to grow food instead. </p> <p>What can be done? It is in our interest to negotiate away the country's nuclear programme - though Pakistan, the source of the technology sold or traded to North Korea and others, seems to be mysteriously escaping global condemnation. It is clear that the programme can be ended with a package of economic and political incentives. If we can set the North Koreans on the broad path to emulating China and Vietnam, the world will be a safer place. With a changing regime instead of regime change, we can move on to restart the human-rights dialogue. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Glyn Ford is the Labour MEP for South West England.

  "<p>The Cuban and Floridian press tried to prepare their readers for the arrival of Hurricane Ivan, as the powerful storm moved on from its battering of the Cayman Islands and Jamaica at the weekend. </p> <p>Florida's <strong>Sun-Herald</strong> admitted that \"the idea that a third major hurricane [after Charley and Frances] could hit us inside a month is too much for many people to imagine - or bear.\" Some Floridians would now leave the state for good, the paper predicted, but \"that will be the exception ... The people close to you will be ready tomorrow, next week and next month to continue rebuilding.\" </p> <p>With characteristic black humour, the novelist Carl Hiaasen provided the <strong>Miami Herald</strong> with a guide to \"the exciting world of hurricane journalism\". The reporter should \"always stand dangerously near the rough water and position yourself so that the spray hits you directly in the face ... Take off your hood and let the wind mess up your hair. Remember: a wet, tired and weather-beaten appearance is crucial to your credibility as a hurricane journalist.\" </p> <p>In the Cuban state newspaper <strong>Granma</strong>, Jose A de la Osa noted with approval that President Fidel Castro had announced that \"no aid will be accepted from those unleashing cruel economic warfare on our country ... After the last cyclone hit Cuba the US government offered the ridiculous sum of $50,000 (\u00a327,797) of humanitarian aid.\" </p> <p>Barbara Gloudon of the <strong>Jamaica Observer</strong> also warned readers that they would need to be self-sufficient. \"We cannot expect overseas aid as quickly as the [Hurricane] Gilbert experience [in 1988] ... The US government has a relief bill of billions of dollars to meet the Florida damage alone. Don't expect any big handouts.\" </p> <p>The <strong>South China Morning Post</strong> took a global view, linking recent hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan to other examples of \"extreme weather\" such as Asia's \"worst floods in decades\" and last year's European heatwave. Global warming, the paper said, was \"the prime suspect\", but this remained \"a matter of dispute\", with some believing it was part of a long-term cycle. \"The lack of comparable data going far enough back in history makes it more difficult for a conclusion to be reached,\" said the paper.</p>",
  "Michael Howard today promised that a future Conservative government would take the international lead on the environment and persuade America to \"join the battle against climate change\". <p>In a speech hosted by the Green Alliance, the Tory leader compared his record on the environment - as a former environment secretary - favourably with that of Tony Blair, which he said amounted to little more than a desire to lecture people.</p> <p>He also committed a future Conservative government to phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons [HFCs] between 2008 and 2014 and reforming stamp duty to encourage greater home energy efficiency. </p> <p>Mr Howard's words were welcomed by the director of Friends of the Earth, Tony Juniper, as the \"most sensible comments on the environment from a Conservative leader for many years\".</p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman, was, however, less enthusiastic, accusing the Tory leader of \"attempting to jump on the green bandwagon\".</p> <p><b>Bringing US on board</b><br></p> <p>Mr Howard used his speech to argue that Conservatives have had a long-term commitment to the environment and to highlight the perceived one-sidedness of the prime minister's relationship with the US president, George Bush.</p> <p>He claimed that, as environment secretary, he had persuaded the previous Republican administration, led by Mr Bush's father, \"not just to attend, but to sign up to the climate change convention, the forerunner to Kyoto\".</p> <p>\"It is very disappointing that Tony Blair has not succeeded in persuading the present administration that the challenge of global warming is one that cannot be shirked,\" he added.</p> <p>He further criticised the prime minister for allowing CO2 emissions to rise and for having a contradictory transport policy and one-club renewal energy strategy.</p> <p><b>New priorities</b><br></p> <p>Mr Howard said a future Conservative government would act on four key areas: reasserting Britain's international leadership on climate change; creating a global market to encourage a reduction in emissions; building up a diverse renewable energy sector; and encouraging greater energy efficiency.</p> <p>To those ends, he said a Tory government would phase out the use of HFCs, which are set to double by the end of the decade, between 2008 and 2014.</p> <p>It would examine how emission trading could be encouraged to business to \"find the most cost-effective route to reduced emissions and to make proper financial provision for the emissions it cannot yet reduce\".</p> <p>And it would look at what incentives it might introduce to encourage such \"vital sources of renewable energy\" as \"offshore wind, biomass and the emerging technologies of solar, wave and tidal power\" which, he claimed, are neglected by the government's focus on encouraging wind farms.</p> <p>Mr Howard added that the Conservatives \"are consulting on a proposal that all homes which meet a specific energy efficiency target, benefit from a reduction in stamp duty\".</p> <p>And he hinted that airlines might be called upon to pay more tax to help deal with the growing problem of aviation pollution, under the \"principle of the polluter pays\".</p> <p>While welcoming Mr Howard's speech, Mr Juniper called on the Tory leader to \"commit himself to Labour's target of reducing carbon dioxide levels by 60% by 2050\".</p> <p>Lib Dem Mr Baker, meanwhile, accused him of being a \"toxic Tory\" who had given \"an amnesty to water companies polluting rivers and attempted to repeal European environmental legislation\" as environment secretary.</p>",

  "\"I am here to make the case for new leadership in the way we manage our environment. Success is central to our pursuit of a better quality of life. The challenge has become more pressing as the evidence grows - both of the risks we are taking and our failure to respond effectively. <p>I make the case today as leader of a party which has consistently placed concern for the environment at the heart of its philosophy. Whether the words were those of Edmund Burke or Margaret Thatcher, the sentiment has been the same for 200 years. Burke saw the living as \"the temporary possessors and life renters\" of this world. The living must think about the future, lest they, as he put it, \"leave to those who come after them a ruin instead of a habitation\".</p> <p>Over the years that rhetoric has been backed up by a long track record of action. It was Conservatives who led the way in public health and clean water - back in the nineteenth century.</p> <p>The Clean Air Acts were Conservative achievements. </p> <p>Conservative governments introduced the modern framework for countryside and wildlife protection; the ban on CFCs; tax incentives for unleaded petrol; the great clean-up of our rivers and lakes; the landfill tax; and the Home Energy and Conservation Act. </p> <p>It was Edward Heath who established the Department of the Environment. </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher was one of the first major world leaders to alert the international community to the threat of global warming. Chris Patten produced the first white paper on the environment. John Major set up the Environment Agency.</p> <p>It was a great privilege for me to serve as environment secretary. I signed the agreement to end CFCs. And one of the most extraordinary and rewarding days of my entire time in government was when I was environment secretary. Just after the 1992 election, I spent a day in Washingtonand succeeded in persuading the United States government, under George Bush senior, to sign the Climate Change Convention, the forerunner of the Kyoto Agreement.</p> <p>My successor, John Gummer, continues to be recognised as a leading international authority on the environment. This is a proud tradition, which I am determined to build on as leader of the Conservative party.</p> <p><b>Looking to the Future </b><br> Today - out of government - we are still doing our bit. Despite the hot air generated by politicians, I am proud to say that we are taking the necessary steps to make our new headquarters in Victoria Street carbon neutral!</p> <p>The environment needs a government that is prepared to set a regulatory framework that is fair, sensitive and effective, that is prepared to lead by example, and that is prepared to stand up and be counted in the international community.</p> <p>Today is a unique opportunity for me to set out the Conservative stall in front of a distinguished and informed audience. Many of you here today have done so much to persuade British governments to do the right thing as far as the environment is concerned.</p> <p>There are many issues that I could touch on. The environment encompasses almost everything we do. But I want to focus on the single most important environmental issue of all - climate change.</p> <p>Climate change is one of mankind's greatest challenges. In the last 30 years, world temperature has increased by almost half a degree centigrade. We cannot predict with certainty what will happen now. The risk of abrupt climate change exists. </p> <p>A recent report for the Pentagon states that \"with over 400 million people living in drier, subtropical, often over populated and economically poor regions today, climate change and its follow-on effects pose a severe risk to political, economic and social stability\". Climate change has happened in the past through a variety of natural causes. But I am persuaded that human activity is a major factor in the changes we see today. </p> <p>As Margaret Thatcher put it in her speech to the United Nations in 1989, \"it is mankind and his activities which are changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways\". Never one for fads or scare stories, she was the original sceptical environmentalist. And she was convinced.</p> <p>The call to action is even stronger today than it was then. </p> <p>Britain and the global community are still moving too slowly. The international effort on climate change desperately needs renewed leadership. </p> <p><b>Labour's Failure on Climate Change </b><br> Britain is in a position to provide that leadership. We have done so in the past. We are one of the few countries likely to meet our Kyoto obligations, largely it should be said because of the Conservative led \"dash for gas\" in the 1990s.</p> <p> We have a privileged relationship with the USA, which leaves us best placed to persuade them into the international fold. We assume the presidency of the G8 and the EU next year.</p> <p>My concern is that we are squandering this opportunity. Because of our failure to follow up bold rhetoric with action that inspires trust. </p> <p>The instinct of our prime minister is to lecture people. But on his watch CO2 emissions have actually risen. He has set ambitious long term targets for CO2 emission reductions but few people outside government believe that there is a coherent plan for achieving them. </p> <p>Labour's policy on sustainable transport is now a jumble of contradictions. </p> <p>Their renewable energy strategy begins and ends with onshore wind farms, despite the opposition from local communities. </p> <p>Their support for new technology is well behind that of other leading economies, despite the fact that they could transform the debate and create great opportunities for British companies.</p> <p>Their incompetence in managing European legislation has been unbelievable. Take fridges for example. When the new rules for disposing of fridges came into effect in January 2002, the UK had only two sites available for recycling and disposal. Defra incompetence led to enormous expense, the infamous \"fridge mountains\" and the transportation of redundant fridges to Europe where the appropriate machinery was available. </p> <p>How can we expect to make progress if even the most basic environmental legislation cannot be properly implemented? </p> <p>Above all, Labour have failed to engage the British people, whose decisions as consumers, taxpayers and parents are of crucial importance in shifting Britain towards being a low carbon economy. In fact, over issues like fridge mountains, they have alienated them. </p> <p>Because of Labour's high-handedness, consumers, communities and small firms now more often than not see environmental regulation as a burden and a hindrance, rather than what it should be, as a step towards a sustainable future.</p> <p>This is not the ideal background against which to assume the presidency of the G8 and the EU next year. </p> <p><b>The Conservative Approach to Climate Change </b><br> So what would a Conservative government actually do? There are four key areas for action: </p> <p>1. Re-asserting our international leadership in this area; </p> <p>2. Creating a global market to encourage a reduction in emissions; </p> <p>3. Renewing the drive for a diverse renewable energy sector; </p> <p>4. And re-focusing on increased energy efficiency. </p> <p><b>International Leadership </b><br> First of all, we must and we will reassert British leadership in the international arena. The best way is to lead by example. </p> <p><b>HFCs</b><br> First, we must be more active in removing the causes of harmful emissions where we are able to. I can announce today that the Conservatives are committed to phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, between 2008 and 2014. </p> <p>HFCs have solved one problem - they do not damage the ozone layer. But they have caused another - they contribute significantly to global warming. Their impact is some thousands of times greater than CO2. HFCs currently account for two per cent of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions and they will have doubled by the end of the first decade of the twenty first century. </p> <p>Some companies are already tackling this problem. Coca Cola - which owns around nine million refrigerators worldwide - is to phase out the use of HFCs in its refrigerators. Unilever has taken a similar stance, and Toyota is introducing non-HFC air-conditioning in their cars. These companies recognise that HFCs are not the way of the future.</p> <p>These are welcome, but isolated, examples. Unless this issue is addressed as a matter of some urgency, and government gives a clear lead, then the situation will only worsen. That is why a future Conservative government will work with our European partners to phase out the use of HFCs over the next decade.</p> <p><b>Bringing the USAinto the international fold </b><br> Like the war on terror, or the drive for responsible free trade, climate change is an international issue that depends on international cooperation. No one can opt out of the fight against global warming. </p> <p>That means persuading the Americans to join the battle against climate change. America generates a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet it has only four per cent of the world's population. </p> <p>Their involvement is essential if we are to have effective action. It can be done. After all, we've been here before. </p> <p>One of the greatest challenges I faced as secretary of state for the environment was to persuade the Americans to participate in the first Earth Summit. As I described earlier, I vividly remember my 24 hours of shuttle diplomacy in Washington before the Rio Summit, ending with me in the White House persuading the Americans not just to attend, but to sign up to the climate change convention, the forerunner of Kyoto. </p> <p>It is very disappointing that Tony Blair has not succeeded in persuading the present administration that the challenge of global warming is one that cannot be shirked.</p> <p><b>The Role of the Market: emissions trading and creative markets </b><br> We can help them by pressing the international community to harness the power of the free market to combat, rather than contribute to, climate change. That must be our second area of focused action. </p> <p>Conservatives have shown how the market can be used to deliver environmental ends. In the past we pioneered market incentives for both recycling and landfill. Emissions trading is the next step. It is something we began to look hard at when I was environment secretary. It will give business the incentive to find the most cost effective route to reduced emissions and to make proper financial provision for the emissions it cannot yet reduce.</p> <p>Europe's scheme is set to start at the beginning of next year. We have yet to see how effective it will be in practice, but we certainly support the principle. Schemes are already available in parts of North America. Together they will provide the building blocks for a global emissions trading system. The promotion of carbon trading will be a major objective for the next Conservative government. But to be effective it must be rigorously policed and must be built on a level playing field, with a consistent carbon value across all participants so that no nation's industry can claim to be at a competitive disadvantage. </p> <p><b>Renewable energy </b><br> Our third major area of focus will be renewable energy. Given that only three per cent of our energy comes from renewable sources, the upsides are enormous if we can find cost effective ways to tap into the almost infinite reserves of renewable energy.</p> <p>The government is betting the farm on onshore wind, focused as it is on its short-term 2010 renewable energy target. In doing so, I believe that they have made two mistakes that undermine the long term potential for renewable energy.</p> <p>First, by changing the planning guidance, they have put the renewables sector as a whole on a collision course with local opinion. They have shifted power away from local communities and put it in the hands of developers and politicians.</p> <p>We oppose the new guidelines. We are not against on shore wind but we believe that communities must be won over, not walked over. That is in the long term interest of renewable energy.</p> <p>The government's second great mistake is its neglect of offshore wind, biomass and the emerging technologies of solar, wave and tidal power.</p> <p>These are now emerging as potentially viable sources of renewable energy. I was delighted, for example, to hear of the first wave machine to supply electricity to the national grid, operating off the Orkney coast. </p> <p>These technologies offer significant commercial potential but Britain is missing out. Even with offshore wind and wave power, where we have enormous natural and technical advantages, we are losing ground to the Danes and the Portuguese.</p> <p>We should not allow these promising technologies to be victims of a classic poverty trap - what the environmentalists frequently call \"the valley of death\" - the gap between grant aid and the ongoing support provided through the Renewables Obligation. We support the principle of the Renewables Obligation but are consulting on ways to reform it so that it bridges the so-called valley of death and provides access to the necessary start-up funds.</p> <p>I am convinced that, with the right incentives and with the right long term vision, the 21st century will be the age of renewable and recoverable energy, just as the 19th century was the age of the steam engine and the 20th the age of the internal combustion and jet engines. Man's ingenuity is almost limitless, and clean energy will dominate the planet and secure our future well before the end of the century we live in today.</p> <p><b>Energy efficiency </b><br> If finding new sources of clean energy is one part of the equation, conserving the energy we use is the other. The fourth major focus for a Conservative government would be an urgent refocusing on the benefits of greater energy efficiency.</p> <p>Energy efficiency has always been the Cinderella of the debate on climate change. It is not as exciting as renewable energy, its effects are gradual and unseen. But there are huge gains to be made. </p> <p>Household energy accounts for more than a quarter of all our CO2 emissions. When I was secretary of state for the environment, I established the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, which succeeded in assisting more than two million homes by the time we left office. But I know how much more there is still to do. Indeed, because of Labour's refusal to push forward energy efficient measures for public housing, we are well behind the energy efficient target set by the last Conservative government. </p> <p><b>Home Energy Efficiency </b><br> The place where we can make the most progress is in the homes that we live in. We must face up to the challenge of Britain's ageing, inefficient housing stock. At least two thirds of it has yet to benefit from any energy efficiency measures at all. </p> <p>It is estimated that insulating the walls of a quarter of a million homes would result in annual carbon savings of around 500,000 tonnes. </p> <p>Only radical measures will ensure that we make real progress in this area. Fiscal incentives have been used in the past to make real progress. They worked, for example, when we introduced differential fuel duty to promote the use of unleaded petrol. They exist at the moment with varying rates of vehicle excise duty. We are looking at a similar approach to encourage homeowners to become more energy efficient. Today it is not a priority issue for most homeowners. Through the tax system we have the opportunity to change attitudes and make even clearer the financial and environmental benefits of energy efficiency. </p> <p>For example an adjustment to stamp duty could be a powerful incentive to increase home energy efficiency. We are consulting on a proposal that all houses which meet a specific energy efficiency target, benefit from a reduction in stamp duty - much in the way that energy efficient cars benefit from reduced road tax.</p> <p>The reform could work in either one of two ways. </p> <p>If the home has been upgraded already, the stamp duty could be reduced at the point of purchase. If the home has still to be upgraded, the new homeowner could make the improvements and then claim a rebate on the stamp duty they have paid.</p> <p>As I say this is the sort of radical measure that we must now consider if we are to make the necessary breakthrough on home energy efficiency.</p> <p>But there may be other areas as well. We also have to consider simplifying the current building regulations that relate specifically to energy efficiency standards, and perhaps replacing them with one simple thermal target.</p> <p>And we should be more ambitious about those standards, and more rigorous in making sure they are met in practice. We are way behind. Just remember that, on average, a British home consumes over three times as much energy as a German home. A Conservative government will consult on the most practical timetable to achieve zero emissions from new houses, without compounding the problems of affordable housing. That must be the ambition and we must strive to make progress towards it. </p> <p><b>Microgeneration</b><br> Micro generation - low carbon power generated by individuals, small businesses and communities to meet their needs - is likely to play an important part in this drive towards greater energy efficiency. I know that the Green Alliance have been active in making the case for bringing micro generation into the mainstream, and I am sympathetic. We should be doing more to facilitate localised generation not least because it is an opportunity to engage the public more closely with the benefits of energy independence and efficiency. </p> <p><b>Combined heat and power </b><br> We also want to make the most of a proven, but shamefully underused technology, which is more than twice as efficient as centrally-generated energy sources. If only we used CHP - combined heat and power - properly we could greatly expand the possibilities for household energy efficiency. For every 1000 megawatts of CHP energy operating in the UK, nearly one million tonnes of carbon are saved each year. </p> <p>When I was secretary of state for the environment, the Conservative government created Britain's first CHP target. We set the country on a firm path to achieving it, and then increased it. Labour have missed our CHP target by four years and the reality is that CHP capacity is now in reverse as ministers invent excuses for inaction or actively discourage it. For example, the new electricity trading arrangements put CHP producers at a significant disadvantage. </p> <p>CHP and micro CHP could be much more prominent, and they will be under the next Conservative government. We will give the CHP industry the confidence it needs to invest for a successful future. We will work closely with local authorities to encourage them to implement more community CHP schemes, particularly in new housing developments.</p> <p>And we will learn from examples of local success. We will look closely at schemes like that in Woking, whose town centre now largely runs on CHP. Britain needs more schemes like Woking's, an entirely achievable goal that would make an immense contribution to our climate change objectives.</p> <p><b>Transport</b><br> Our pursuit of energy efficiency must include the transport sector where it is clear that we must do better. </p> <p>Transport contributes around a quarter of our emissions and that proportion is expected to grow, not least as aviation emissions are expected to double by 2020.</p> <p>Over many decades, the car industry has made huge strides in making cars more fuel efficient through a combination of stick and carrot. The future looks even more promising. A new generation of cars, using LPG and hybrid technology, are on the market, offering up to 50% savings in emissions. But they represent less than 0.5% of the total UK vehicle fleet.</p> <p>Biofuels can cut emissions by 50% compared with fossil fuels. But they represent less than 0.2% of the UK market. Hydrogen is coming. Ford and General Motors have promised production model hydrogen cars by the end of the decade. </p> <p>These are exciting prospects for a government and society that has the vision and will to help the great polluter of the twentieth century become the most environmentally-friendly form of motorised transport in the 21st century.</p> <p>A Conservative government will work harder to bring the future forward. Through the tax system we have opportunities to send clearer long term signals and incentives to both motorists and suppliers. Through action at the European level, we have the opportunity to set higher standards for monitoring and improving fuel efficiency and emissions. The carrot for the industry is the guarantee of a real market in the future for fuel efficient vehicles. But the stick to ensure action will be more effective and ambitious Europe-wide energy standards.</p> <p>Government can provide leadership here not just through regulation, but by example. Between them, the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Home Office have 5,836 vehicles. Just 183 of them use alternative power. A miserable three per cent.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will make it a point of principle for every car purchased by a government department to be the most fuel efficient or best alternative fuel car available.</p> <p>Nor will we duck, as this government has done, the challenge of getting under control the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases - aviation. </p> <p>Britain cannot solve the problem of aviation pollution on its own. But we should do more to inform consumers of the environmental impact of their choices. We should work to reach faster conclusions on the feasibility of including aviation in an EU, and eventually global, emissions trading scheme.</p> <p>We should be more insistent in pursuing the principle of the polluter pays. And more imaginative in giving industry the incentives to pursue greater efficiency and less noise pollution. Promoting greener behaviour need not hold back economic growth or restrict choice. But the longer we delay action, the harder it will be to achieve that outcome. </p> <p>Today I am giving you a sense of direction in relation to promoting greener transport. Over the next few weeks and months we will be announcing more specific ideas. We hope they will generate an honest debate, one which will engage the British people with the key challenge of adapting to achieve a more sustainable way of life.</p> <p> If you asked anyone in the street whether they are concerned about the environment, they would say, \"yes, of course we are\". It is one of those issues that we are all signed up to. It is motherhood and apple pie.</p> <p>In a sense, that puts the environment at a huge disadvantage. We talk about the need for a debate on the environment but in fact that there is almost no meaningful debate. It means that politicians like me can trot up to the odd conference, and make a fine and concerned speech, and go away again, perhaps coming back in 12 months to chuck around a few statistics to show what progress has - or has not - been made.</p> <p>The urgency of global warming means that fine words are no longer enough. We need action. </p> <p>I am the first party leader who has served as environment secretary. It's an issue I care passionately about. I want the Conservatives to carry on leading this debate. And we will. </p> <p>The next Conservative government will replace aspiration with achievement and words with actions. We will reassert Britain's global leadership on climate change. We will renew the drive for a diversified renewable energy sector. We will champion renewable energy technology to bring forward the future. We will provide fiscal and pragmatic incentives to increase energy efficiency dramatically. </p> <p>And we will engage the British people because in this debate we are all decision-makers. </p> <p>We have inherited a diverse and beautiful world - we must hand it on, enhanced and not diminished. </p> <p>It should be the ambition of every politician in this country - and indeed every politician around the world - to say when he or she leaves office: if you want to see my monument, look around you. I have left this world a better place than when I found it.</p> <p>I believe that the next Conservative government will be able to say that. I am determined that it should.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of WPP, has fuelled speculation that his next target is the French advertising agency he defeated in the battle to take over Grey Global today.</p> <p>After defeating Havas for the race to buy Grey, Sir Martin today refused to rule out bidding for parts of WPP's smaller French rival if it was eventually sold. </p> <p>Sir Martin revealed in a conference call with analysts that 18 months ago the company had twice attempted to buy a minority stake in a Havas unit, Media Planning Group, only to be rebuffed.</p> <p>\"We have expressed an interest, historically, in parts of the group,\" Sir Martin told financial analysts today.</p> <p>\"A Havas spokesman cheekily suggested that no approach had been made and that rather annoyed me,\" Sir Martin said.</p> <p>But Sir Martin suggested a bid for Havas was not part of his current thinking. \"We have to focus on our issues. It's probably wrong for us to focus on Havas.\"</p> <p>Some analysts predict that Havas, the loser in the race to buy Grey, might itself be sold within two years.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't want to upset Vincent Bollore,\" Sir Martin said, in reference to the prominent Havas shareholder who was against the company attempting to bid for Grey.</p> <p>Mr Meyer, the 77-year-old chairman of Grey Global, said he had met with staff today and explained why he was selling the agency to WPP.</p> <p>\"To handle the large, multinational clients out there it has been necessary to join with another group,\" Ed Meyer told analysts. \"I'm thrilled it's WPP.\"</p> <p>Mr Meyer, who will remain as chairman of Grey Global but will step down from his role as chief executive of its advertising agency, Grey Worldwide, said staff in New York had \"reacted warmly and supportively\" when he explained the reasons for the sale.</p> <p>Mr Meyer and Sir Martin will jointly choose a new chief executive for Grey Worldwide. Mr Meyer said he would then join the WPP board.</p> <p>Mr Meyer said that the business, although a public company, had been run \"somewhat familiarly\" because of his large personal shareholding in the company. He said Grey's low profit margin was due to it being geared towards serving the clients, rather than achieving a high profit margin.</p> <p>Mr Meyer said none of his clients had \"given me a hard time\" over the sale.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Ed Mayer, the 77-year-old chairman of advertising group Grey Global, today described the deal to sell his company to Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP as \"bittersweet\".</p> <p>He has landed a \u00a3187m windfall from the \u00a3845m acquisition of his company but in an email to staff said it was a tough choice to sell out.</p> <p>Ed Meyer, who joined the New York-based advertising firm in the 1950s, is to stay on as chairman and chief executive officer and has won guarantees from WPP that the company will retain its independent identity.</p> <p>\"This is a somewhat bittersweet moment for me. Grey's historical independence was right for us for many years; it helped catapult us to the very top of our profession. But now, looking to the future, I am reassured, indeed, inspired by the confidence I have that Grey will remain Grey and our passion for great client work will remain our center of attention,\" he said.</p> <p>Grey Global, the world's largest remaining independent advertising agency, has been on the market for the last three months since the veteran Mr Meyer indicated he was willing to talk to buyers.</p> <p>In the email to staff he described WPP as one of the world's \"most admired communications companies\" and asked staff to remain \"laser-focused\" on the business of servicing their staff.</p> <p>\"Business as usual sounds a little trite but it's very much true,\" he said exhorting staff to \"get back to work\" after the unsettling weeks they have suffered.</p> <p>WPP came out on top after a three-way battle with French advertising group Havas and US investment firm Hellman and Friedman, he has walked away with a deal worth \u00a3120m more than expected.</p> <p>Mr Meyer has signed a contract to remain as chairman and chief executive of Grey until at least December 31 2006. He will remain chairman of Grey Worldwide, the advertising division of Grey Global, until a successor is appointed six months after completion of the deal. Mr Meyer will then become a member of the WPP board.</p> <p>\"I have spent my entire working career, nearly 50 years, at Grey helping companies build many of the world's greatest brands,\" Mr Meyer said in a statement. </p> <p>\"I am equally proud of the work I have done to build the Grey brand. I am personally committed to a very smooth integration and to Grey's continuing success.\"</p> <p>The \u00a3845m acquisition was confirmed on the stock exchange this morning and, with combined revenues of \u00a38bn, WPP has closed the gap with Omincom, the world's largest advertising services group. </p> <p>The deal follows 48 hours of intense negotiations and was clinched on Saturday night. Grey Global is the world's seventh largest advertising group and the largest last remaining independent.</p> <p>WPP will pay about $1,005 a share, more than most analysts were predicting in a deal that is half cash and half shares. Grey's closing share price on Friday was $940. </p> <p>The deal gives Sir Martin Sorrell's group access to a series of blue-chip clients including Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, 3M, Mars and Warner Bros.</p> <p>WPP will manage client conflicts by running Grey as an independent network alongside its other advertising networks, J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Young &amp; Rubicam. </p> <p>The company will look at ways that Grey's MediaCom, the largest media buying agency in Britain with \u00a3611m in annual billings last year, can use its buying power in alliance with WPP's media buying agencies. \"In addition to broadening our relationship with a number of our leading clients, Grey will bring access to new clients, strengthen our activities in advertising, media investment management, public relations, healthcare and direct and interactive,\" Sir Martin said in a statement today.</p> <p>\"Additionally, Grey's broad geographic spread will further strengthen WPP's market position. We believe that WPP will offer Grey's clients and its people significant enhanced opportunities.\"</p> <p>The deal requires regulatory and Grey shareholder approval, but Mr Meyer has pledged to vote for the deal and he controls about 43.5% of total voting power.</p> <p>WPP said it would finance its cash offer for Grey from its existing facilities and expected to issue $82.2m in ordinary new shares, about 6.5%</p> <p>Havas, which confirmed it had made a bid last week, did not increase its initial offer. </p> <p>\"An increase in the price would have compromised the speed and level of return on investment of Havas' current shareholders,\" the company said in a statement today.</p> <p>\"At the end of the offer process, we concluded that the price required by Grey would not allow us to generate sufficeint added value for our shareholders,\" said Alain de Pouzihac, the Havas chairman.</p> <p>\"As a result, we did not increase our offer, so as to remain totally focused on the objectives I set our teams over a year ago - to relaunch our group to rapidly reach the same growth and operating margin levels as the market leaders.\"</p> <p>WPP said the deal would lift its revenues in the fast growing regions of Asia and Latin America - a priority for Sir Martin - to more than \u00a3750m.</p> <p>WPP and Grey would save \u00a311m through synergies in head office and worldwide infrastructure. </p> <p>WPP said it would increase Grey's operating margin, a level of profitability, from 5.8% in 2003 to 10.5% in 2005. WPP said the combined margin for the two groups in 2005 would be 14%.</p> <p>The deal is a further indication of global consolidation in the advertising industry. WPP bought UK rival Cordiant, owner of the Bates network, last year while Publicis, the French advertising group, bought US group Bcom3 in 2002.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>If you thought product marketing was all about multi-million pound TV ad campaigns, think again. True, advertising still plays a major role, but media fragmentation has made it increasingly tough for brand owners to win customers solely via conventional ad campaigns. Which is why big, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are concentrating more of their marketing muscle on targeting consumers where they know they will be noticed - in shops. </p> <p>Brand owners will spend \u00a31.17bn on \"point of purchase\" - in-store - marketing activities this year. In fact, industry figures show 91% of brand-owning companies expect their expenditure on this to rise over the next year. The reason is simple: three out of four buying decisions are made by shoppers within the last few minutes before they reach the checkout. </p> <p> Not so long ago, in-store marketing meant point-of-sale promotions - the poor cousin of glossy TV advertising campaigns. But today it has become a complex and challenging, multi-disciplinary marketing specialism in its own right, extending from how products are positioned on shelves to in-store media and promotions, data collection and analysis, says Guy Vaughan, director of Retail Marketing Services, Europe's leading in-store market research specialist. </p> <p>\"For many years, in-store marketing has been driven by retailers,\" he says. All of the leading supermarket chains have followed Tesco's lead and introduced loyalty card schemes to collect invaluable insight into their shoppers' brand preferences, shopping habits and lifestyles, for example. </p> <p>Most are now developing in-store media: earlier this year Tesco became the first supermarket to launch its own TV channel, with the advertiser-friendly claim that it would attract more viewers than I'm a Celebrity _ Get Me Out of Here. </p> <p>The TV station is being rolled out in stores around the country and features health and beauty tips, recipe ideas and information on healthy living - as well as conventional advertising - on large TV screens with programming targeted to suit specific aisles. </p> <p>Rival Asda claims to reach 13m shoppers a week with its in-store media, which ranges from magazines and radio stations to live events. \"Retail marketing has got far more credibility among branded suppliers now,\" claims Asda's media centre director, Sarah Brookfield. </p> <p>Since the late 1990s, brand owners have focused on in-store marketing to try to gain greater control over how their products are marketed in-store. Some, including Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle, have even set up in-store marketing operations dedicated to getting the best possible deal for their brands. </p> <p>\"The traditional way of taking brands to market has changed and we have had to respond to that,\" explains Jesper Wiegandt, director of P&amp;G's dedicated in-store marketing department. \"We can no longer rely on traditional advertising.\" </p> <p>Wiegandt's department comprises 10 in-store marketing specialists charged with everything from coming up with ideas for in-store events to analysing different retailers' customers for the brand marketing teams. </p> <p> \"We can't run the department as an isolated empire: co-operation with other departments is critical,\" says Wiegandt. Which is why team skills are a major requirement for in-store marketing specialists at P&amp;G. Equally important, however, is work experience from other marketing fields. </p> <p>Members of the P&amp;G team have backgrounds in traditional sales, traditional media buying and traditional advertising. What sets them apart is that they also share an entrepreneurial flair. \"As this is still a relatively new area, you need to be able to thrive in a poorly defined environment,\" says Wiegandt. </p> <p>It's a similar story at Unilever Bestfoods, the part of Unilever responsible for manufacturing brands such as PG Tips and Hellmann's. \"In-store marketing has become increasingly important over the past three or four years, driven by factors including the development of the supermarket environment and the space available in these outlets for branded FMCG products being reduced,\" says Nick Widdowson, merchandising manager for Unilever Bestfoods UK. </p> <p>There are two main aspects of visibility management, he says. \"The first concerns shelf layout - analysis of space allocation and product performance determines the optimum space a product deserves on-shelf. Understanding how the customer shops in-store, as well as the structure of the product category, helps the merchandiser recommend the best position on shelf for a product.\" </p> <p>The second involves developing \"point of purchase\" materials to enhance the display of a product on-shelf or in other positions. </p> <p> The qualifications required by visibility managers at Unilever include some in-store experience, technical and computing skills, and creative and analytical ability. The current team includes people with backgrounds in store management, customer management, brand development and supply chain management, and degrees in marketing and design. </p> <p>Despite the newness of in-store marketing as a specialism, long-term career prospects look good. The evolution of digital technology at point of purchase combined with the premium placed on space in supermarkets mean it will be critical for any consumer brand's future success.</p>",
  "<p>It's a funny thing, celebrity. How can Nadia from Big Brother be part of the same shiny, stardust world as Victoria Beckham? Or Tom Cruise and the comedy, moustachioed runners from the 118118 advertising campaign? </p> <p>The point is, fame now comes in all shapes and sizes. And as society has become increasingly obsessed with every possible permutation of it, companies have woken up to the power of celebrity endorsement for their brands. They see how celebrity can brush off on a brand, making it hit the headlines as a result - and they all want a piece of it. </p> <p>\"Brands need to have a celebrity strategy today because celebrity is taking on a more powerful role in people's lives,\" says Julian Henry, founder of the consumer PR agency, Henry's House, which counts Johnny Vaughan and Will Young among its star clients. \"Companies cannot afford not to have some sort of tie-in. Without a strategy, they are missing a valuable link to their customers' lives.\" </p> <p>Over the last 10 years, deals between brands and famous people have become far more sophisticated. Bunging Ulrika Johnson a couple of grand to turn up at a photocall or plonking some random household name in a testimonial ad is no longer enough. </p> <p>\"Core to any endorsement now is the successful transfer of brand values from the celebrity to the brand,\" explains Stephen Curnow, senior marketing officer at SFX Sports, the leading sports marketing agency behind Andre Agassi and Gary Lineker. </p> <p>\"There has to be a good fit. The brand is essentially borrowing the characteristics of the individual. Any successful endorsement must either change or reinforce consumer brand perception.\" </p> <p>The most tangible element of an endorsement is the star-led advertising campaign, such as Beyonce and Britney Spears in Pepsi's last TV blockbuster, Peter Kay in the hilarious John Smith's ads, or even Michael Winner in the excruciating e-sure commercials. One recent survey found that as many as 50% of the ads in the centre break of Coronation Street had some sort of celebrity connection. But there are also a whole host of other possible off-screen deals. </p> <p>\"The celebrity-led TV commercial is the icing on the cake,\" says Curnow. \"A typical endorsement involves use of the star's image for on-pack advertising, in-store promotions or press advertising. In addition, they may well agree to appear at company conferences, golf days or even sign a quantity of merchandise.\" </p> <p>As the market has matured, celebrities have become pickier and more demanding about what they will do. Mark Borkowski, agency head of Borkowski PR, which specialises in celebrity stunts, says: \"We used to try to get stars 'out' of the commercial and create publicity around them or buy them up as endorsers, but now agents are much cuter about the deals.\" </p> <p>Johnny Vaughan's late 1990s tie-in with Strongbow, for instance, stipulated that he would only appear in the ads and nothing more. David Beckham's deal with Vodafone was similarly restrictive. </p> <p>The endorsements can be worth anything from thousands of pounds to fees of over \u00a31m for the global stars. Beckham's international deal with Gillette, clinched in May, was reported to be worth a colossal \u00a330m, but then he has been identified as \"the new Lady Di\", capable of touching everyone - and that comes with a hefty price tag. </p> <p>Hollywood celebs and international sports stars may be stratospherically expensive, but there are alternative celebrity sources to plunder. TV provides a rich seam of cheaper talent, while some companies have even made stars of their own workforce. Hence the Halifax selected its bespectacled employee, Howard, to front its advertising, fusspot Alex from Big Brother 3 was snapped up by Domestos in July 2002, and creative PR even made a celebrity out of an animal - the cat in the Bacardi commercials. </p> <p>\"We call it 'celebrification',\" says Henry. \"Society has become 'celebrified' - celebrity is now something that is accessible to everyone. It is not just A-list celebs like Jamie Oliver and Posh Spice, it's behind-the-scenes people or the man in the street. Everyone has potential.\" </p> <p>The world of celebrity endorsements is far from plain sailing, however. Dealing with famous people might seem like fun, but it can involve back-breaking negotiations, fighting through multiple layers of over-protective hangers-on, and having to handle big egos. Then there are the scandals, which can suddenly plunge a brand into crisis (consider Wayne Rooney's latest colourful, off-pitch behaviour and its impact on his squeaky clean sponsors, Coca-Cola, Ford and Nike). </p> <p>\"What happens if you've got someone who doesn't behave or who has some sort of drugs scandal?\" asks Borkowski. \"Your brand can go down with them and you can be left with a year-long deal you want to get out of.\" </p> <p>Working in such a market requires nerves of steel, strong networking capabilities, tenacity and commitment, say the experts. </p> <p>\"You have to be positive in your approach even when faced with a nightmare situation and you've got to be strategic in your vision,\" advises Henry. </p> <p>Borkowski cautions further: \"You must be spirited, freewheeling, passionate to succeed in an often bizarre world and, most importantly, have a containable ego. You need to have your feet on the ground and not get carried away with the world you're dealing in.\" </p> <p>If you are determined to enter this particular jungle, the best thing is to bang on doors and convince companies you would be prepared to \"lie in the road for your star\". </p> <p>PR or general marketing degrees might be handy, but, ultimately, it's down to gritty determination plus a fair bit of luck. And remember, advises one rather jaded practitioner, \"You'll need that not just to get started in your career.\"</p>",

  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell's advertising group, WPP, appeared to have clinched the takeover of Grey Global, its smaller American rival, yesterday with a cash and shares deal worth just over $1.3bn (\u00a3720m). </p> <p>Grey last night confirmed that its directors, led by chairman and controlling shareholder Ed Meyer, are recommending Sir Martin's terms - defeating rival offers from the French group Havas and an American private equity consortium, made up of Hellman &amp; Friedman and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Grey refused to give further details. </p> <p>The move, which will see WPP close in on Omnicom, the world's largest advertising and marketing conglomerate, came after 48 hours of intense negotiation. Grey's directors made a final decision to sell at a board meeting on Friday, before entering detailed negotiations with each of the short-listed bidders. WPP secured Mr Meyer's support early on Sunday in New York. </p> <p>The takeover hands Sir Martin the chance to handle the account of Proctor &amp; Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, which is assumed to have supported the WPP deal. </p> <p>At the same time, WPP is expected to pre-empt concerns over potential conflicts of interest with existing clients by retaining a quasi-independent Grey network, operating alongside the established WPP advertising group. Most notably, Sir Martin will have to assure Unilever - P&amp;G's chief rival in the consumer goods sector - that it will continue to receive a premier service. Similarly, Sir Martin will have to address issues of overlap between WPP and Grey with clients such as Nokia and BAT, which may ultimately move some of their business to a competing agency group. </p> <p>While the precise financial terms of WPP's offer remained unclear last night, it is believed to have increased the cash portion of its offer significantly during the final hours of negotiation. Competition from both the private equity consortium and Havas came in the form of pure cash bids. </p> <p>Speculation over corporate developments in the world of advertising is now likely to turn to Havas, where rebel shareholder Vincent Bollore had voiced his opposition to the Grey bid, arguing that Havas was simply too weak financially to consider the deal. </p> <p>Its chairman and chief executive, Alain de Pouzilhac, pressed on regardless, seem ingly viewing a Grey takeover as his last chance of propelling Havas into the top ranks of global advertising. Mr de Pouzilhac won financial backing from Deutsche Bank and Caylon, the French bank, only to be outbid. </p> <p>Mr Bollore, a maverick investor who first came to prominence 10 years ago after build ing up a holding in the Lazards investment banking empire, had offered to help strengthen Havas's balance sheet if the company recast its ambitions. The financier is thought to have recently increased his stake to over 10% and industry analysts believe Mr Bollore may now use his holding as a platform to call for boardroom changes. </p> <p>Grey, the world's seventh largest advertising group, was considered to be the last of the major independents after the consolidations of the 90s. It remains unclear how long Mr Meyer, who joined Grey from P&amp;G in the 50s, will stay with the business. The takeover is likely to see him bank a payment of more than \u00a3300m.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The Blair-Brown saga, Hurricane Ivan's devastation and concerns about teenagers' mental health</p> <p><b>A BLACK DAY IN BAGHDAD</b></p> <p>When the FT's front page consists of three business stories, you might guess there's not much general news about. In fact, there's quite a bit, but today's papers are much more concerned with Blair-Brown speculation ahead of the TUC conference.</p> <p>With a picture and caption, the FT manages to squeeze Iraq onto its cover. The image is of an Iraqi man waving a flag over the burning remains of a US armoured personnel carrier. The caption tells us that 110 people died across Iraq in widespread violence yesterday, and that the man is a \"rebel\" celebrating a suspected car bomb attack in a \"Ba'athist stronghold\" area in Baghdad. The Guardian's report on the same incident is on page 2, but has none of the sangfroid of the FT's coverage. The Guardian says 13 Iraqis were killed when US helicopters fired on \"unarmed demonstrators\". It says an Arab journalist was killed. A Guardian journalist and a Reuters cameraman were also injured. </p> <p>Earlier in the weekend, the Times spoke to the Iraqi interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi. He told the paper that elections would go ahead in January, even if some areas, such as Falluja, had to be excluded because of ongoing unrest. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1303127,00.html\">Thirteen die in US attack on Baghdad crowd</a><br>* <a href=\"http://search.thetimes.co.uk/cgi-bin/ezk2srch?-aSTART#\">Times: Why I cannot give every Iraqi the vote</a></p> <p><b>11 INTO 10 WON\"T GO</b></p> <p>\"Today the political soap opera goes on tour,\" writes Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian, as conference season gets under way with the TUC's annual gathering. \"One storyline will loom larger than all the others.\" Yes, Wrap readers, prepare for even more stories about Tony and Gordon.</p> <p>The Guardian kicks off with a report about divisions between the Labour party and the unions, which means points dropped by Tony Blair. It says the \"big four\" union bosses have warned the prime minister, who addresses the TUC conference today, that \"policy concessions agreed in the summer\" had to be honoured. The areas addressed in a \"national policy forum\" in July were mostly employment rights and pensions. Significantly, the union leaders also got in a dig at Alan Milburn, the Blairite MP entrusted last week with the party's manifesto. They accused him of making \"wild statements and ideas\".</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph concurs, saying union bosses have said \"they would not tolerate interference by Mr Milburn\". It cites foundation hospitals as one of Mr Milburn's \"wild ideas\", and quotes Kate Hoey, a former Labour minister who says the foundation trusts are a \"mess\". \"On the back benches\", says Ms Hoey, \"there will be a feeling of why has [Mr Milburn] come back so soon, other than to show Gordon the prime minister is in charge.\"</p> <p>In case you worry Mr Blair is clocking up too many points, let's go back to the Guardian for a gleeful report on the prime minister's conceptual difficulties with economics. A former Downing Street adviser has published a book in which he says Mr Blair is a figure of fun at No 10 for his limited grasp of the subject. Apparently, a well-meaning official once attempted to give the prime minister some basic textbooks as holiday reading. The Guardian says this ties Mr Blair into a \"noble, if slightly amateurish tradition\" going back to Alec Douglas-Home. It says Mr Blair's holiday reading \"usually consists of worthy - but not academic - biographies\", while Mr Brown likes \"to immerse himself in the works of such heavyweight thinkers as Noam Chomsky\".</p> <p>There's none of this wide-eyed admiration for Mr Brown's intellectual abilities over at the Times. Next to a sinister cartoon of an eyeless chancellor being kept out of No 10 by a snarling Milburn-dog, William Rees-Mogg launches a blistering attack on Mr Brown's pensions policy, which he says \"has been one of the great disasters of British financial history\". And that's one of the nicer bits. He says Mr Brown has wrecked both state and private pensions, imposed stealth taxes and reduced the valuation of the stock market. \"He has impoverished generations of old people past, present and to come.\" No, I don't understand how he can impoverish the past either. In any case, Rees-Mogg concludes that demographics are against Mr Brown, as an ageing population means that at the next election nearly half of active voters will be pensioners. On the front page, the Times says national insurance contributions will have to rise by one-and-a-half pence in the pound to fund bigger state pensions, and that the prime minister is considering making contributions compulsory. The chancellor, says the paper, wants to wait until the next parliament to deal with the issue.</p> <p>So, with divisions multiplying in the Labour party, happy days for the Tories? Sorry, says the Daily Telegraph. Damian Green, an MP who resigned from the shadow cabinet last week, tells the paper Michael Howard is \"wilfully dividing the party by shifting it to the right\". Bizarrely the paper's leader comment then criticises embittered former shadow cabinet members who \"assist Downing Street in creating the impression of a 'lurch to the right\".

The paper says 56 people were killed in Grenada and Jamaica when the storm hit. Details were \"sketchy\" as to what had happened in the Caymans because communications had been hampered by the storm. Cuba's president, Fidel Castro, is shown taking a personal interest in the weather. There are worries about crops on the island being destroyed, and about high-rise buildings collapsing, though Mr Castro says Cuba is \"prepared\". </p> <p>The Times graces its report with a little fact box comparing the Cayman islands - a \"British overseas territory\" - and Cuba - a \"communist republic\". GDP per capita in the Caymans is \u00a320,000, against \u00a31,555 in Cuba, the Times notes. The Wrap is a cynical soul, and suspects the Times is making some sort of ideological point, albeit one slightly undermined by the first listing under \"main industries\" for the Caymans: \"tax haven\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=561023\"> Independent: Ivan tears into Cayman islands</a></p> <p><b>'ANXIOUS, DEPRESSED AND ANTISOCIAL'</b></p> <p>A welter of reports about young people brings out traditional concerns in three of the papers. The Times leads its \"iGeneration\" report with a picture of princes William and Harry, who are typical of the youth of today in various ways, the exception being that they are prepared to fight for their country. Well, it is their country. </p> <p>The Guardian is worried about the mental health of 15-year-olds. A survey shows sharp increases in behavioural problems over the past 25 years, across all social classes and in all types of family. Madeleine Bunting on the comment pages thinks the problem is pressure, notably pressure to do well in exams. </p> <p>The Sun worries that young people are having too much sex. It is, as people all over England will be remarking to one another, \"a terrifying teen sex timebomb\". One in four, we learn, \"romps while underage\", and 60% don't use a condom. Many also drink alcohol. The report sits under a picture of \"flirty Kirsty\", a television presenter modelling a new range of flimsy underwear.

  "Research which finds that teenage problems have more than doubled in 25 years is the kind of headline-grabbing news that social scientists launch gingerly into the public domain. You could hear the nervousness as I interviewed one of the authors. This kind of statistical research is raw and powerful ammo for a string of ugly political agendas. No wonder the researchers decided to leave alone all question of the causes of this explosion of misery: they wanted to separate out a set of bald facts about the increase in 15-year-olds' emotional and behavioural disorders, and leave others to get stuck into the arguments. <p>Put this research into the hands of the Daily Mail and it would be ample grist for those peddling tales of Britain's moral decline: kids don't know right from wrong; they lie, they steal, they're disobedient. Or another favourite: the breakdown of the family is making our teenagers miserable, and working mums should bear the most blame as the rise in maternal employment virtually parallels the increases in emotional and behavioural problems. New Labour has opted to play the former tune - Tony Blair gave one rendition earlier this summer in his tirade against 60s values. </p> <p>New Labour has had only two policies on youth: its crusade against anti-social behaviour and its mission to raise educational standards. It expects two things of adolescents: that they achieve academically and are law-abiding. A very large proportion fail on one or both accounts. Surveys of the developed world show UK teenagers have one of the worst staying-on rates in after-16 education and are more likely than most to take drugs, binge drink and have underage sex. Compared with this dire record, the success story of government policy has been all about Sure Start and early years. The language is about investment, as if children were stock options. The pressure is on teenagers to start paying returns - and yet this is entirely at odds with reality. </p> <p>Never has the financial dependence of children lasted so long - well into their 20s - and at the same time consumer pressures have intensified. No political party has known what to do with adolescents once the apprenticeships and assembly-line jobs ran out. The Tories cut their benefits. Under New Labour, they got the New Deal and little else. Adolescents have had a raw deal out of a government which heaps expectations on them which they can't meet. In the New Labour rubric of rights and responsibilities, they were given the latter but without the means to fulfil them. At the same time, the rights shrank. It is harder than ever to get on to the housing ladder, harder than ever to fund a university education. New Labour has only exacerbated the contradictions of the transition to adulthood which awaits your average 15-year-old. We expect them to be independent and yet cut off all financial means of being so. No wonder the 18- to 24-year-olds are the constituency least likely to vote. </p> <p>Experts are divided about the rise in teenage misery. They broadly fall into two camps. The first take the view that the causes lie predominantly in structural issues: for example, the labour market has few jobs for 16-year-olds spilling out of an unsatisfactory education, and the secondary educational system sets up far too many children to fail. Plus, we have a media culture which bombards teenagers with marketing and invidious social comparisons that undermine self-esteem. As a result, adolescence has became a painful experience and teenagers are self-medicating with drugs and drink to cope with the stress. </p> <p>This is the explanation which has got through to government, and two initiatives out next month will propose remedies: the Tomlinson report is looking into a restructuring of education for 14- to 19-year-olds, while a green paper will look at youth services such as leisure activities. The concern is that both are being drawn up according to the familiar New Labour preoccupations of ensuring that teenagers are employable and law-abiding. </p> <p>The second camp take a much bigger and more disturbing view. They argue that this is not just a problem of adolescence, but that further research is likely to show up a comparable rise in miserable seven-year-olds. They argue that there has been a deterioration in the mental health of all children. This isn't just about troubled teenagers but troubled tots. An increasing number of under-twos are exhibiting abnormal behaviour which is being diagnosed as depression. </p> <p>The idea that we are raising unhappy children seems close to a doom scenario, but even more horrifying is how commonplace this kind of assumption seems to be among many experts in child and adolescent mental health. It is an assumption which has made few inroads into public debate and has had precious little impact on government policy: only 5% of the mental health budget goes to the under-16s. Perhaps we just don't want to know; we invest so much in the happiness of our children, we can't bring ourselves to face the evidence to the contrary. Perhaps we prefer to indulge in moral panics about their unruly behaviour rather than listen to their misery. </p> <p>This line of argument takes us swiftly into huge controversy because it goes to the heart of how we parent. It suggests that an increasing minority of parents are unable or unwilling to provide the emotional nurturing which will ensure a resilient child. Margot Waddell, consultant psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic in London, defines that as wisdom, thoughtfulness, consistency, forbearance and availability. These qualities can occur in any shape of family and in any kind of childcare, so we shouldn't get caught up in pinning the blame on single parents or working mothers - it's the emotional dynamics which count. The question is why fewer of us are providing that kind of care for our children. At adolescence, early experiences of childhood are being replayed, says Waddell, and the stress of the transition to adulthood exposes all the faultlines. Dinah Morley, of the mental health charity Young Minds, puts it even more starkly: there is a failure in attachment. A growing number of us simply aren't bonding sufficiently with our babies. </p> <p>That's a haunting thought. We're anxious parents now, but what we worry about more than ever is our children's safety, health and education. Childhood has been infected by a highly supervised techno-managerialism loaded with targets and statistics - developmental outcomes, tests, league tables - and perhaps we need to put back centre stage an old dream: happy children. What is just as important to a child's life chances as a clutch of exam certificates is their emotional resilience to deal with what life will throw at them. It's a troubling possibility that our teenagers are like the canaries they used to take down the mines to detect gas. Their acting-up is acting out a much bigger problem. </p> <p><b> \u00b7</b> Time Trends in Adolescent Mental Health is published in November's issue of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Vogue, the ultimate consumer bible, is planning to launch a Chinese edition next year, giving readers in the People's Republic the opportunity to slaver over the latest haute couture designs from the likes of Christian Dior and Chanel.</p> <p>Publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast's entry into the market comes as the world's largest media companies jockey for position in an attempt to tap into the country's huge population.</p> <p>Jonathan Newhouse, the Cond\u00e9 Nast chairman, said the glossy magazine would launch next year in partnership with Chinese publisher China Pictorial. </p> <p>\"It is a distinct pleasure to bring Vogue to China and to an ever-widening global audience,\" he said. </p> <p>The launch of the 112-year-old high fashion title in the world's most populous country is the latest stark example of the growing conflict between the Chinese government's desire to open up the country to global trade and its determination to enforce communist doctrine. </p> <p>On the face of it the magazine will be at odds with the possibilities on offer Chinese consumers.</p> <p>The magazine has long enjoyed a reputation as a purveyor of the aspirational and often unaffordable as well as promoting unattainable role models for young girls in the shape of ultra-slim and long-legged young women.</p> <p>But China is slowly opening itself to western consumerism and upmarket fashion retailing. Armani recently opened shops in Beijing and Shanghai and plans to open more. And Prada, which has very few standalone stores, has also singled out China for its next shop.</p> <p>But Vogue's entry into China lags behind its competitors, which have published women's fashion titles in the region for nearly a decade.</p> <p>Hearst began publishing a Chinese edition of Cosmopolitan in 1998 and Harper's Bazaar in 2001, among 15 other titles. Hachette Filipacchi, a unit of France's Lagardere SCA, has published Elle magazine in China since 1989.</p> <p>Mr Newhouse said Vogue had deliberately delayed its entrance into the Chinese market and had also fallen victim to a three-year ban on issuing new permits to publish magazines by the general administration for press and publication. </p> <p>Emap's lads' title FHM also launched in the country earlier this year, although the version on offer in Beijing would be virtually unrecognisable to UK readers of the magazine used to pages of semi-naked flesh. </p> <p>FHM is being produced by the Trends Group, which also publishes the Chinese versions of Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar and Esquire</p> <p>Vogue is likely to face a myriad of obstacles as it navigates unfamiliar territory, said one competitor, citing difficult conditions endemic to the nascent publishing market in the country. </p> <p>The main problem is that magazine publishers have been largely restricted to three key points of sale - Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, George Green, the chief executive of Hearst International, told Reuters. </p> <p>\"Distribution is the biggest problem,\" he said, citing a lack of an efficient distribution network, which controls how magazines are sold and delivered in other countries. \"There are limitations to how big you can get.\" </p> <p>But the lure of the region remained strong. \"The market is terrific,\" Mr Green said. \"The country has identified the problem and is working on it.\" </p> <p>Mobile phone companies and media giants including AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp are among those attempting to forge a presence in China, but progress has been slow as they attempt to negotiate the tricky political climate. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>McDonald's is upping the ante in its PR battle against critics who link its food with childhood obesity by funding the training of 10,000 community football coaches across the country.</p> <p>The company has trained 5,100 local club level football coaches across the UK since 2002 and hopes its efforts will have a trickle-down effect in the battle against the negative PR that is engulfing the company.</p> <p>Unlike Walkers, which promoted a school books campaign, McDonald's prefers a low key approach, advertising on noticeboards about local football teams in its outlets rather than through a large advertising campaign.</p> <p>\"It's a community programme for McDonald's, it's not a marketing programme,\" said Caron Beith, the head of Leo Sports, a division of Leo Burnett, McDonald's advertising agency.</p> <p>The coaching programming is one plank in McDonald's PR strategy in the obesity debate. </p> <p>The company has stepped up advertising its salads and healthy foods to counter negative publicity surrounding the release of the anti-McDonald's documentary, Super Size Me, in which filmmaker Morgan Spurlock damaged his liver after eating nothing but McDonald's food for a month.</p> <p>On Friday McDonald's launched a new phase in its healthy eating campaign with a newspaper advertisement asking readers, \"Don't fancy a Hamburger?\" and answering, \"Then you have come to the right place.\" Another advert promoted its salads in press adverts with the caption, \"Funny looking fries\". </p> <p>Ms Beith said the community programme had benefits for McDonald's in the obesity PR war. \"McDonald's uses the coaching programme to encourage people to be more active,\" she said.</p> <p>The coaches are recruited and trained by the Football Association in England, and the relevant associations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But children and their parents cannot fail to be aware that McDonald's funds them. The coaches wear tracksuits with McDonald's logos and use 16 footballs supplied in two kit bags that are branded with the McDonald's logo.</p> <p>\"When Ray Kroc started McDonald's, being a part of the community was part of his ethos,\" Ms Beith said.</p> <p>The company is on track to achieve its target of training 10,000 coaches by 2006.

  "It's a long way from Brussels to Diyarbakir, dusty capital of Turkey's remote south-east, so Guenter Verheugen, the EU's German commissioner for enlargement, got a red-carpet welcome last week when he flew in to assess how things are going as the moment of truth approaches. <p>Turks have been straining to hitch their wagon to Europe for 40 years, and it is finally about to happen. Next month, the commission will say that they have met the political criteria for membership; governments are expected to follow suit in December. This is a very big deal: no country that has begun negotiations on joining the club has failed, eventually, to make the grade. Actual membership could be 10 or more years away, and by then there will be 80 million-plus Turks. With voting power tied to population size under the new EU constitution, Ankara will be as important a player as Berlin, Paris and London. </p> <p>Yet this is about much more than how a Europe of 28-plus countries will work: as a secular democracy whose citizens are mostly Muslim, Turkey could be a beacon for Islamic and Arab countries stunted by underdevelopment, human-rights abuses and fundamentalism - and which still have lessons to learn from Ataturk's revolutionary separation of mosque and state. </p> <p>The prime minister, the conservative Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has pushed ahead with political, judicial and economic reforms while powerful generals have had their wings clipped, allowing flexibility over Cyprus. The prospect of being in \"Europe\" has been a big spur to change, on both sides of the Bosphorus. </p> <p>Not all the news is good. As Verheugen rightly warned, implementation of new laws on Kurdish language rights and on torture has been slow and patchy. And there is dismay at Erdogan's ill-conceived and domestically controversial support for a law banning adultery, a family-values issue for his supporters. </p> <p>Turks already have a hard time facing down the sort of prejudice expressed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whose elegant circumlocutions about \"cultural differences\" are only slightly less offensive than the cruder view of another clever Frenchman, Voltaire, who called the Turks a reminder to Christians to atone for their sins. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, support for Turkish membership is weakest in France (16%, according to the German Marshall Fund), and many believe accession talks should not begin until after the country's risky referendum on the EU constitution. But hostility is strong too in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands: another Brussels commissioner, the Dutchman Frits Bolkestein, spoke darkly of the \"Islamisation\" of Europe if Turkey joins - a betrayal of Christendom's historic victory over the Ottomans at the gates of Vienna in 1683. That's hardly the right sort of message to send to the 12 million Muslims who are already European citizens. </p> <p>Turks know a long haul lies ahead, and are prepared to be patient. But Erdogan is hardly being alarmist in signalling a dangerous backlash if the EU's \"yes\" is anything other than unequivocal. </p> <p>Complicating this question is heavy pressure from the US to embrace its veteran (though no longer automatically compliant) Nato ally and strategically placed neighbour of Iraq, Iran and Syria. Resentful Europeans counter that the EU is not a military alliance but a union of democracies sharing some sovereignty - and wonder out loud how George Bush would react if Jacques Chirac kept urging him to accept Mexico as the 51st state. Transatlantic tensions are inescapable these days. But they should not be the deciding factor here: if the EU is indeed a community of values as well as a huge market and aspiring global player, then a warm welcome for a rapidly changing Turkey should be beyond doubt. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Democrats made a small gain in the Hong Kong legislative council elections yesterday, exit polls indicated, but failed to meet their expectations. <p>They had portrayed the elections as a virtual referendum on the right to vote, but a sex scandal, Beijing's carrot-and-stick policies and the complicated voting system kept their gains in check. </p> <p>\"I am disappointed. It shows how unacceptable the electoral system is,\" said Martin Lee, a former chairman of the Democratic party. </p> <p>Supporters of democracy seemed certain to have increased their 17 of the 30 directly elected seats by at least one, the television exit polls suggested. Supporters of Beijing were projected to increase their share from seven to nine seats. </p> <p>The other 30 seats on the council are indirectly elected by professional and business groups. </p> <p>Eleven have been returned unopposed, the other results are not yet known, but the bloc has been dominated since the return to Chinese rule in 1997 by supporters of the Communist government in Beijing, which nominates the territory's chief executive and has ruled against early steps towards greater democracy. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands demonstrated against that decision on July 1, giving the Democrats hope of increased support. </p> <p>But Tsang Yok-hing, a former chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, said yesterday: \"The message we got from voters in the past few weeks is many want ... a stable, harmonious environment.\" </p> <p>The high turnout - about 53%, which equalled the 1998 record, had been expected to favour the Democrats. </p> <p>The official results are due today. In the previous chamber the democracy camp held 22 seats and the Beijing group 34; the rest were held by independents. </p> <p>Support for the democrats began to sag after a Democratic party council member, Ho Wai-to, was arrested in southern China last month and held for six months for allegedly hiring a prostitute. </p> <p>He has not been re-elected, and some Democrats suspected that the incident was set-up by Beijing to smear him. </p> <p>The winners include the maverick Marxist \"Long Hair\" Leung Kwok-hung, who has taken every opportunity to heckle the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa. </p> <p>\"I'll demonstrate my electorate's dissatisfaction towards this minority-chosen government by protesting in the council in my special way,\" he said last night. <br><b>Reuters</b></p>",

  "I was head of sixth form at Tulse Hill school, a medium-sized boys' comprehensive in Lambeth, south London, from 1977-89, when 161 of our students proceeded to degree courses at university (No more lost boys, September 7). The ethnic make-up of those students was as follows: black-African-Caribbean 43; black-African 13; Asian 47; white (UK born) 44; other (born in Europe, Turkey, South America etc) 14. <p>The relative success of our African and African-Caribbean students was the result of a number of factors, few of which seem to have been considered by the Mayor's London Development Agency, and an advisory board led by Diane Abbott. Sixth forms should be seen as a vital catalyst for working-class and ethnic-minority success for the following reasons. </p> <p>The presence of a large number of 17- to 19-year-old academic achievers act as role models for the rest of the school population - many inner-London boroughs have abandoned sixth forms for spurious economic reasons; continuity of pastoral care is an important element for many children, particularly as they approach school-leaving age; and the availability of A-level teaching attracts high-quality staff, and also broadens the social mix of students as middle-class parents no longer see the need to reject local comprehensives. </p> <p>Tulse Hill (sadly closed in 1990) introduced a multicultural curriculum, which would probably not be allowed by Ofsted's dead hand.

  "I first met Samira Bellil, who has died aged 31 from stomach cancer, at a grimy community centre in Marseille on Valentine's Day last year. She was small, with eyes that were surprisingly blue for a young French woman of Algerian origin, and corkscrew curls that I recognised from the cover of her book, Dans L'Enfer Des Tournantes (In The Hell Of Tournantes). <p>Published in 2002, it had made her immediately infamous, because it was the first time a young woman had dared to reveal the reality of life in the deprived ghettos - the banlieue - of French cities. In these suburbs, violence against young women was standard; gang rapes were endemic. They were not even called gang rapes, but tournantes, or pass-rounds, because the girl was passed around like a joint. </p> <p>Samira was first gang-raped when she was 14, when her boyfriend handed her over to three of his friends. They beat her viciously, raped her all night, and then made her breakfast. A month later, the most violent rapist, K, dragged her off a train by her hair, while other passengers looked the other way, and she was gang-raped again. These events made her, if not typical of a young woman of immigrant background in the suburbs, then not exceptional either. </p> <p>Samira was born to Algerian parents in Algiers, but her family soon moved to the Parisian suburb of Seine-Sainte-Denis. Her father was sent to jail almost immediately for what Samira later described as \"stupidities\", and she was fostered by a family in Belgium for five happy years, before being summoned back to her parents \"like a parcel\". She found her father violent and distant, and her home life was not happy. </p> <p>As a teenager, she started to go out, to meet boys, to rebel. It was dangerous behaviour, in a macho environment where a girl's reputation is sacred. A reputation could get you sent back to the bled, or homeland. Or worse: girls who dared to go out, wear make-up or drink were considered fair game for a tournante. When young women were told to behave, or they would end up in the basement, everyone knew what it meant. </p> <p>Samira did not report her rapes until two friends told her that K had raped them too. Reprisals are common - flats burned down, little sisters threatened - but Samira decided to prosecute. In the end, K was sentenced to eight years in prison. </p> <p>As she wrote in her book, she was condemned to a lot more. Her parents threw her out in shame, and her quartier, or neighbourhood, rejected her. \"People outside the estates don't know,\" she said. \"And everyone on the estate knows, but they won't say anything.\" There were years of drug abuse, squats, foster homes, despair. </p> <p>Eventually, she found a psychologist who helped her. She had years of therapy, and decided to write her book to show other young women that there was a way out. \"It's long and it's difficult, but it's possible,\" she wrote in the dedication - to \"my sisters in trouble\". She used her real name and put her photo on the cover, \"because,\" she said, \"my editor said I had a nice face\". She played it down, but it was courageous, especially as she still lived in the same quartier, and K lived there too. </p> <p>Samira was at the social centre in Marseille that day as part of a women's march organised by Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Slags Nor Doormats), the first organisation - which she had helped to found - to publicly address the issue of violence against young banlieue women. The march got attention; Samira's book had shocked France into acknowledging what was happening in its suburbs. </p> <p>Young women who were used to keeping quiet for fear of family pressure or worse, now stood up in packed community halls, finally telling the truth. At a public debate, a young man asked Samira what was wrong with gang bangs, anyway. She looked exhausted, but she responded characteristically. \"Firstly, mate,\" she said, looking at him, \"get it straight. It was not a gang bang. I was gang-raped. OK?\" Thanks to her book and her activism, the French government and the mayor's office in Paris began researching the problem of violence against young banlieue women, and her portrait was hung outside the French national assembly. </p> <p>Samira continued to speak out, though, as she told me when we met for an article I wrote on tournantes for Guardian Weekend last year, \"I can't carry all that violence forever\". She slowly found some peace, doing drama, which she loved, and working as a youth worker in her quartier; she said there were incredible people in the banlieue , and that despite everything, that was where she belonged. She was reconciled with her mother, and close to her two sisters, and she even decided that not all men are bastards, as she put it. </p> <p>She wanted to fall in love, be normal, but she didn't have time; after a life of violence, and a short period of respite, she was defeated by cancer. She deserved better.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Samira Bellil, writer, activist and youth worker, born November 27 1972; died September 4 2004</p>",
  "<p>When Brazilian president Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva visited Haiti last month to inspect some 1,200 of his troops leading a United Nations peacekeeping mission there, he did more than watch both countries' soccer teams play a game designed to bring much-needed cheer to the troubled Caribbean nation. </p> <p>The trip reinforced just how much new-found visibility Lula's two-year-old government has gained on the world stage and, combined with recent positive economic news in Brazil, made many ponder the president's potential future at home. </p> <p>Since winning Brazil's presidency by a large margin in 2002, the former union activist and pre-eminent figure within Brazil's Worker's party has re-cast his country's image abroad from that of \"the country of the future, always has been and always will be\" to one of a nation struggling concretely to get a handle on its economic and social ills while steering an independent and activist course in international affairs. </p> <p>In August, Brazil successfully led the G20 group of poor nations as it argued before the World Trade Organisation that subsidies paid to farmers by wealthy nations had priced the agricultural exports of other countries off the world market, miring nations like Brazil in persistent poverty. </p> <p>In April, the WTO sided with Brazil over a charge that cotton subsidies to US farmers were illegal because they artificially depressed world prices. </p> <p>Taken with Brazil's volunteering to lead the peacekeeping duties in Haiti and its role in negotiations to form the Mercosur trading bloc among South American countries, the Lula government has garnered significant praise from some of the same quarters that have lambasted Venezuela's left-leaning Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>On the domestic front, after undergoing an agonising 0.2% economic contraction in 2003, the Brazilian economy shows marked signs of picking up this year, a trend Lula's party will no doubt exploit to its fullest in municipal elections around the country scheduled for October. </p> <p>Brazil's economy expanded by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2004, a stunning leap beyond the year's first-quarter expansion rate of 2.7%. The Brazilian central bank opted to keep its benchmark lending rate at 16% on August 18 in an effort to blunt the spike of inflation and the rate, while still high, nevertheless represents a three-year low and far below the 26.5% with which Brazil began 2003. </p> <p>Lula is not without his problems. A law submitted to the Brazilian congress this month to set up a government-run journalism council, designed to accredit, regulate and censor reporters wishing to work in the country, has been denounced by local media professionals as smacking of the authoritarianism which characterised Brazil's 1964-85 military dictatorships. </p> <p>Inflation surged to a 15-month high in July, with consumer prices rising 0.91% after a 0.71% increase in June, which left the rate of price rises over the previous 12 months at 6.81%, up from 6.06% in June and including a 2.5% increase in petrol prices. </p> <p>The head of Brazil's central bank, former Fleet Boston Financial Corporation executive Henrique Meirelles, recently saw his position elevated to cabinet-level status despite being summoned before the Brazilian senate, accused of failing to declare all of his assets in his tax returns. </p> <p>Nevertheless, these difficulties are not seen as insurmountable. \"Lula's popularity is safe now as long as the economy and employment continue to grow,\" says Terry McCoy, director of the Latin American business environment programme at the University of Florida. \"Inflation does not seem to be a threat despite the recent uptick.\" </p> <p>The questions about Meirelles, while troubling, many say are likely have to reach a far higher pitch before they pose any significant danger to the administration. </p> <p>\"It's clear that there's something fishy going on, but not how bad it is,\" says David Samuels, author of Ambition, Federalism and Legislative Politics in Brazil. \"But this is not going to be the scandal that brings down Lula's government or forces Meirelles to resign. The supreme court is going to have to bring charges or even congress itself for this to stick.\" </p> <p>The question, it appears, is not whether the Worker's party will gain in the coming elections but how broad the margin of victory will be and how convincing a mandate it will provide for the Lula government. </p> <p>With analysts raising their predictions for overall 2004 growth for Brazil and the country having posted four successive quarters of positive economic movement, many observers are looking for the Brazilian president to come out of the ballot newly empowered to continue down the economic path he has blazed during his first two years in office.</p>",
  "<p>Three of the country's biggest accounting bodies are likely to announce tomorrow that they will merge into one larger body, representing 200,000 accountants and 80,000 students. </p> <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales (ICEAW), the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima) and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) announced exploratory talks two months ago. Previous attempts to merge have failed, however. </p> <p>The institutes hoped that a combined body \"will command a position of tremendous influence in the global profession\", Cipfa president Mike Barnes said at the time. </p> <p>All three say they are coming from a position of strength but they also face a need to cut costs due to sluggish membership growth. </p> <p>The rival Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), which has 320,000 members and students globally, has accused the three bodies of being forced to throw in their lot with each other because of problems in attracting new students and members. </p> <p>Cima says, however, that a tie-up would create \"a single voice that would have more influence on accounting issues in discussions with governments, regulatory bodies and standard setters\". </p> <p>The merger plans may be opposed by some of the institutes' members who would have to give their approval to the merger. Their qualifications are similar but not identical. </p> <p>Cipfa specialises in local government while Cima generally handles accountancy for business. ICEAW members staff most of the big four accounting firms and sit as finance directors on the boards of many of Britain's largest companies.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago it was hailed as the biggest single investment in public transport outside London and essential for breathing new life into run-down communities. In authorising a three-fold expansion of Greater Manchester's super-tram system - Metrolink - deputy prime minister John Prescott, then transport supremo, hailed the network as a model for the rest of Britain. </p> <p>The local passenger transport executive (PTE) spent \u00a3200m buying land while demolishing houses, blocks of flats - even schools - along the proposed routes of three new lines while it prepared to let contracts for the expansion. </p> <p>Out of the blue two months ago, transport secretary Alistair Darling pulled the plug on the system, which began operations in 1991, because he claimed costs were rising out of control. </p> <p>However, others suspect that the Department of Transport has gone cool on schemes for light rail, or trams, in a string of cities - earlier this year Nottingham became the latest to take to the streets - as it grapples with the cost of the proposed Crossrail rail link between west and east London. </p> <p>At first sight Mr Darling's decision appears to have some justification, with the cost of Metrolink's expansion rising from an original \u00a3520m to \u00a3900m. </p> <p>But transport planners claim the costs are inflated because companies which run the system under contract to the PTE now include a sizeable sum in their estimates to take account of risk. The experts say costs could be reduced considerably if the government or local taxpayers agreed to underwrite some of that risk. The Department of Transport is said to be balking at the prospect. </p> <p>Whatever the financial arguments, Mr Darling's decision, which has been privately questioned by Mr Prescott, has generated a big campaign in Greater Manchester, with slogans plastered on the sides of trams, town halls and in shopping precincts. </p> <p>As part of a Get Back on Track campaign, rallies are being held throughout the conurbation while a deputation of local MPs met Mr Darling at the weekend, apparently gaining few concessions. Tony Blair has agreed to meet another lobby group. </p> <p>\"No issue in recent times has so united people in anger and bewilderment,\" proclaimed Michael Meacher, the Oldham West and Royton MP and former environment minister, at a weekend rally in his constituency. \"All of us are going to fight to get this changed for as long as it takes.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Mr Prescott told the Guardian that expansion of the network was still a live issue. \"The trams have been a success in Manchester. They have got people out of their cars and on to public transport, and brought growth to outlying areas.\" </p> <p>The deputy prime minister is particularly uneasy because he will be hosting a conference on urban themes in Manchester in January which will attract speakers from around the world. It will include study visits around a city which Mr Prescott sees as one of the greatest regeneration successes in Britain. Metrolink was meant to symbolise that success. </p> <p>When the first Metrolink line opened in 1991, stretching 20 miles from Bury to Altrincham, with a short spur to Eccles following in 1998, the system was hailed as a pace-setter for the rest of the country. The planned new lines would link Manchester city centre with Oldham and Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester's booming airport, Britain's third largest. </p> <p>Around the country, seven systems are now operating, from the extensive Tyne and Wear Metro, which opened almost 25 years ago, to Sheffield, Croydon, Birmingham-Wolverhampton and Nottingham. Others were planned for Leeds and Liverpool, while a system for Edinburgh, Mr Darling's home city, is in the pipeline with part of the funding likely to come from the Scottish Executive, not the Department of Transport. </p> <p>Claiming the various systems were a huge success, the then transport minister John Spellar said his department was \"extremely heartened\" by their operation. But that was two years ago. At the weekend Mr Darling told the protesting MPs that the rise in Metrolink's costs was not acceptable. </p> <p>Chris Mulligan, director general of Greater Manchester PTE, said the Department of Transport was encouraging the conurbation to consider congestion charging as a way of funding extensions. </p> <p>\"That is a flip-flop in government policy because the idea is that you improve public transport to provide an alternative to the car before any changes take place,\" he said. \"We have proved this system is a great success. It makes a healthy surplus. I have never seen such a strength of feeling among our MPs.\" </p> <p>Manchester city council maintains that the government has a moral commitment to proceed with the scheme because developers have been persuaded to invest in the city on the grounds that Metrolink will serve the regenerated areas, particularly around the Commonwealth Games complex in east Manchester.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Given the average age of a Telegraph reader, Monkey wonders whether its editor, Martin Newland, was right to lay into his 80-year-old father in a piece about a pilgrimage in Spain in last weekend's paper. Young Martin describes how his mother, when angry with his father, referred to him as a boludo (literally, heavy balls). \"Frequently, visits to see my family are marred by fights between us on these fronts - and not just disagreements, but massive verbal conflagrations,\" says Martin, who ends up calling his dad a \"sod\".

As the room temperature plunged below zero, Paterson's wife Sue Robertson, spin matron at Channel Five, weighed up whether to drench the Australian in Jacob's Creek. \"I really can't as I'm always nagging my team about discipline,\" she decided. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Cilla Black had her audience in stitches at the launch of her new entertainment extravaganza on, er, Living TV last week, but not perhaps in the way she intended.

I've heard they do very good handjobs.\" Oh for the innocent days of the first Blind Dates. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Stephen Lambert, the creative driving force at Wife Swap producers RDF, made one plea to members of the Broadcasting Press Guild after addressing them over lunch last week: Not to print the mind-boggling sum he said anyone who drops out of the indie's US reality shows can be sued for.

Miles will act as consultant editor, running the central fea tures section. Who needs a TV listings magazine when newspapers provide it as a throw in? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Richard Sambrook starts work today at Bush House, and - besides a biog on the World Service website which piquantly gives a perhaps uncalled-for prominence to his carpeting over the Gilligan affair - the ex-chief of BBC News will find a somewhat confusing set-up. Nigel Chapman, the former deputy to Mark Byford who was tipped to get the top job before Sambrook's sideways move, is now director of the World Service, while Sambrook (who moonlights as boss of global news) is its head. As Vinnie Jones might say, who's the guvnor? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> It has miffed a lot of folk that the tasty new contract to make 30 media shows for BBC4 - under the banner The Desk - has gone to Moonbeam Films and Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9's Winkontent. But perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Moonbeam's founder Anne Reevell launched Radio 4's acclaimed media show Medium Wave. One of her early contributors was a trendy young thing called . . .

Professor Richard Wiseman, chair of the understanding of psychology (there's a job that involves a lot of sofa time) finds that the surreal notions that surface in our dreams, every so often result in \"an amazingly creative solution to an important problem\". </p> <p>Snooze, anyone? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Oh yes, Christmas. Major decisions to be made. What image to choose for the corporate greetings cards? A jokey cartoon? A revered old master? Something funky and modern? Hey, how about nothing at all? </p> <p>Mercifully, homeless charity Crisis has come up with a solution to let us off the hook. That's right, no more Christmas cards, everyone. In exchange for a donation, they will publish your name and a hearty seasonal greeting over a double page spread in the Financial Times over the holiday season. That way, you get to look smug and self-righteous, and your corporate clients will thank you for not cluttering up their filing cabinets. </p> <p>One thing you might like to remember: keep the cards you receive this year. Next year, when you don't get any, they might come in handy to brighten up the office in the depths of December. Who's going to know? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> If you want to keep your job, don't get pregnant. This is the doom-laden message from the Equal Opportunities Commission, who find that \"women who get pregnant face pay cuts, demotion, hostile treatment or are made to work in an unsafe environment.\" </p> <p>In some cases, there isn't even a pretence at finding some sort of pretext. Nearly a quarter of women who made an employment tribunal claim were dismissed within hours of telling their employer they were pregnant. That doesn't even give her time to become excessively emotional and forgetful. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Is this your chance to change your life? No, not Extreme Makeover, it's an excuse for the public to laugh at someone else's foolish dreams. </p> <p>BBC3 is looking for participants for two new series, Fantasy Career and Fantasy Business. You get a taste of your dream career change (you know the kind of thing, football manager wants to be a masseur, politician wants to be a nursery schoolteacher) and then they send in the experts to tear your ideas down to size. </p> <p>Anyone with a crazy business idea aged 25-40 should call 0161 244 3974 or email <a href=\"mailto:fantasyseries@bbc.co.uk\">fantasyseries@bbc.co.uk</a>. No aspiration too ludicrous.</p>"
