  "<p>When Gordon Brown stands up to deliver his autumn pre-Budget report, due by early December, it will be the usual tub-thumping recital of his greatest hits: unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s; the longest uninterrupted period of growth since records began; public debt repayments slashed since the dark days of Tory rule. While he sticks to his familiar theme tune, though, his critics will be murmuring the t-word - tax. The government is boxed into the tightest financial corner since Labour came to power, and there is a growing consensus that, once the election is out of the way, Brown will be left with little option but to push up taxes to get himself back on track. </p> <p>The Chancellor's spending habits are constrained by his self-imposed 'golden rule' - he allows himself to borrow only to fund investment, so other spending has to be balanced against receipts over the economic cycle. If he dips into the red in a lean year, he has to make up for it by running a surplus in healthier times. </p> <p>The Treasury reckons the current cycle began in 1999-2000, when Brown was sticking to strict Tory spending plans and running up chunky surpluses. It is projected to end in 2005-06. On the latest estimates, made in this year's Budget, he is due to meet his golden rule with a wafer-thin margin of \u00a311 billion to spare. </p> <p>Since those plans were written, much of the economic news has been bad: oil prices have shot up to record highs above $50 a barrel, and few analysts expect them to come down any time soon; consumer spending and the housing market are showing signs of the long-awaited slowdown; and the US economic recovery seems to have hit the skids. Brown is pinning his hopes on economic growth of 3-3.5 per cent in 2005, to bring the tax receipts rolling in; but the consensus among experts is now 2.5 per cent. 'I do feel that his forecasts are too optimistic,' says Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Simon Rubinsohn, of City brokers Gerrard, agrees: 'If you stick with the forecasts, you're leaving yourself open to the criticism that you're not responding to global developments.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, the latest snapshot of the public finances, released last week, showed that, even this year, with growth expected to live up to Brown's expectations, current spending is expanding too quickly for him to hit the \u00a310.5bn deficit he is expecting. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain's top tax think-tank, says that at this rate the deficit on the current budget could be as large as \u00a322bn, gobbling up his margin for error and leaving him no choice but to bust the rule next year. The Treasury recently tweaked the way it assesses the rule, measuring the average budget deficit as a proportion of GDP over the cycle, instead of looking at the raw cash figures; but the analysts say which ever way you look at it he's in danger. </p> <p>Fortunately for Brown, it's the Treasury that decides when the economic cycle ends. He could announce in the pre-Budget report that he thinks the economy has picked up more quickly than expected, so that the cycle ends in 2004-5, allowing him to meet the golden rule, and emerge from the next election with a clean sheet. </p> <p>But Oliver Letwin, the Tory Shadow Chancellor, says there will have to be a reckoning after the election. 'He provided himself, I think wrongly, with the ability to fiddle the assessment of the timing of the cycle, and because of that he will find a way of not breaching the rule in advance of the election; but he then faces the fact, if he's re-elected, that he's starting a new cycle without the surpluses with which he began the last cycle, and with runaway spending.' Letwin believes the probability that taxes will have to go up to make the sums work in the longer term is '99.9 per cent'. </p> <p>Christine Frayne, of the IFS, agrees that moving the end of the cycle forwards 'would increase the need for tax increases or spending cuts to ensure that the rule is met over the next economic cycle'. And cuts are difficult, with plans already pencilled in for every year until 2008, under which spending will expand at the same rate as the economy. 'He's in a really tight position,' says Loynes. 'The elbow room built into the fiscal rules has diminished. It may be that he can just about cling on to the current forecast; but it leaves whoever is there after the election almost certainly having to raise taxes.' </p> <p>Letwin says that, despite Brown's commitment to cut civil service posts and pare back costs, his political priorities, and the powerful momentum that has built up behind spending in Whitehall, make it impossible for him to alter the path of future spending. </p> <p>'The point is, it's become a structural deficit, because his current spending on bureaucracy is out of control. He would like to control it, but he can't. The ineluctable consequence is that you have to raise taxes.' </p> <p>The Treasury refuses to accept that logic. 'There will be absolutely no softening of the golden rule,' a spokesman says, dismissing doubts about its forecasts. But if Letwin, the IFS and the City are right, the timing could be exceptionally tricky for the Chancellor. Selling tax increases to a public who are simultaneously being told they must save more for their retirement, or to a business sector facing soaring costs and tough competition, would take all Brown's considerable political acumen. Not only that, but being labelled a tax and spend chancellor, instead of the man who abolished boom and bust, would make a tricky platform from which to launch a leadership bid.</p>",
  "English football will have its sexiest, shiniest face on today when Manchester United take on Arsenal at Old Trafford. The sublime talents of stars such as Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo may decide what some are calling 'the game of the decade'. There will be a sellout 68,000 crowd, millions will be watching on television, at home or in the pub, and a global audience of several hundred million more in 186 countries. <p>But appearances are deceptive. There is a growing disaffection as our investigation into the Premiership in today's Sports section reveals. Beneath the sheen of money, excitement and success, problems loom large. Crowds are falling, down 6 per cent compared with last year. Attendances have dropped at more than half the Premiership's 20 clubs. Fans are finally refusing to pay prices which, for years, have far outstripped inflation. Clubs such as Chelsea are increasingly reluctant to offer cheaper tickets to young fans. They may bring in more revenue in the short term, but if today's curious eight-year-old cannot afford to attend a game, he or she may never become a lifelong regular. </p> <p>The outcome of the Premiership is increasingly predictable. Arsenal's 'invincibles', chasing their 50th match unbeaten today, are beautiful to watch, but unhealthily dominant. If the first three in an Olympic marathon were known after six miles - or even before the start - with everyone else competing for fourth place, how compelling would we find that? Added to this are intractable concerns that diminish the game's reputation: unscrupulous agents, the off-field behaviour (drug-taking, urinating in the street, 'roasting') of players who earn up to \u00a380,000 a week, while a growing number of live matches broadcast on Sky may be breeding over-familiarity. The self-styled 'most exciting league in the world' is attracting resentful disillusion. Fewer games seem to matter; the 'degree of uncertainty' which gives sport its raison d'etre is being eroded. </p> <p>Other major sports have had to be innovative to survive: cricket's 20-20 format has been a success, as has rugby union's Heineken Cup. Should the Premiership be cut to 18 teams? Should there be fewer live games on television? Would a 'shared revenue' system, which operates in America's major sports, help end the English game's competitive imbalance? We should ask, too, how Germany, where players are paid much less than England, can still draw crowds bigger than in England (and why fans standing at matches do not misbehave). More immediately, Premier League clubs could remember that it's a game first and a business second. Start charging less and see the full houses return.</p>",
  "Loopholes in Whitehall guidelines are allowing ministers to pressure scientists charged with providing government with impartial advice, it was alleged yesterday. The claims raise fears that independent guidance about scientific issues could be compromised unless action is taken. <p>Last week two leading radiation experts, Bryn Bridges and Dudley Goodhead, accused former environment minister Michael Meacher of 'attempting to manipulate' the work of the Cerrie committee on radiation dangers - claims that are rejected by Meacher. </p> <p>The Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (Cerrie) - made up of academics, nuclear industry staff, and experts recommended by green groups - reported last week that radiation risks to the public could be 10 times greater than previously thought. At the same time, two dissident Cerrie members, Richard Bramhall and Chris Busby - backed by Meacher - published a separate report claiming the dangers were were really hundreds of times worse. </p> <p>Goodhead, Cerrie's chairman, told The Observer : 'I came under extraordinary pressure from Meacher - while, and after, he was environment minister - to include a minority report by Bramhall and Busby in our final official report. I refused because their conclusions were unsupportable.' </p> <p>This view was backed by Prof Bridges, chairman of Comare, the standing committee on radiation risks to whom Goodhead and his committee members reported. 'Dudley and I are both heading for retirement,' Bridges said. 'We have nothing to lose. 'But younger scientists, with careers ahead of them, might well have backed down in the face of such pressure from a minister.' </p> <p>Cerrie was set up in 2001 by Meacher to examine dangers posed by radioactive releases into the environment. 'It was originally called a consultative exer cise, not a committee,' said Goodhead. 'It also included two individuals, Richard Bramhall of the Low Level Radiation Campaign and Dr Chris Busby of Green Audit, who hold extreme views about the dangers of radioactive discharges. But as we were acting merely as a consultancy, I didn't mind. </p> <p>'Then Meacher changed our name from a consultancy to a committee - even though the latter has more stringent membership rules. This was done by back-door methods.' Goodhead said he believed Meacher was being secretly briefed about committee discussions as they occurred, even after he had been sacked as environment minister last year. </p> <p>As a backbencher, he continued to ask detailed parliamentary questions which exactly mirrored committee debates. At the same time, several stories appeared in national newspapers claiming that key views about the dangers of radiation were being suppressed by the committee. Meacher was quoted in many of these. </p> <p>In the end, Cerrie refused to publish Bramhall and Busby's minority report, despite Meacher's 'bullying', as Goodhead put it. Instead their views were published by an independent Welsh company. Meacher provided an introduction but ignored the publication of the Cerrie report, although he commissioned it. </p> <p>'I think Michael Meacher was right to set up this investigation,' said committee member Phil Day, of Manchester University. 'But recently, he has let himself be influenced by people who hold extreme views and that has been very damaging.' </p> <p>Last night, Michael Meacher said he has been in regular contact with Bramhall and Busby during the committee's meetings but said this was 'perfectly normal'. He said criticisms of his use of parliamentary questions were impertinent and that he had behaved properly towards the committee at all times. 'At no time did I try to bully or influence this committee. It is an utterly unfounded allegation which I reject,' he said.</p>",
  "<b>Frost bite</b> <br> <p>Your editorial (Comment, last week) concerning the US Presidential election stated that America is about to reach a fork in the road and has, so far, shown indecision on which direction to take.

  "<p>One of the first signs that things are going awry is when you start to measure your life in song lines. Not in a Chatwin-esque, sub-Aboriginal way, but more in a Leonard Cohen, Radiohead, Nick Drake kind of manner. I wouldn't dismiss this approach out of hand - like every other melancholic, middle-aged man I am an inveterate sucker for poetic gloom - but real darkness needs lifting, not indulging. You have to find some light or go under. The garden is damp and unkempt and reminds me of a basement flat that has not been lived in for a while. If I were a visitor I wouldn't know who gardened here or what they were about. Yet of course I live here - it is my home and it is all my fault, one way or another. Look at it another way. It is like a marriage. We live together, the garden and I, share the same space for a minute or two (there I go again, another line, the temptation for second-hand emotion is overwhelming), but we are clearly not spending enough meaningful time together.</p> <p>But I make myself go outside and look for the good. In the vegetable garden, the artichokes have regrown with the new vigour they show in spring. Although this is a triumph of hope over experience because the frost will cut them down, it is stirring to see. The 'Doyen du Comice' pears are just at the point of picking. I am loath to gather them off the espaliers any sooner than I must - and yet once they drop it is too late. </p> <p>I counsel others to check them all every day but don't do it myself, of course. If only. The late sowing of beetroots worked, and there is now a whole bed of golfball-sized beets with very edible tops. The chicory's all dandy; the radicchio and 'Red Treviso' turning their winter crimson. </p> <p>I am good at chicory. This is not hard, but the knowledge and reminder of it cheers me up. </p> <p>Then on into the damp garden, ravaged by neglect. No, on closer inspection, that is my cast of mind. The eyes form a kinder judgment. A bit weather-blown, perhaps, but mainly just unvisited by me. We are strangers to each other and I resent this very much. </p> <p>You have to do it together, you and the garden. We need each other to make any sense out of it. I see that the comfrey has grown back lustily from its cut-back just a few weeks ago and the lovage and cardoons are brown echoes of their summer selves. But there, solitary and at first hidden, is the best thing I have seen in this garden for weeks and weeks. A solitary quince, pear-shaped, downy and lime green.</p> <p>Just five yards away is another quince tree, bent double with the weight of its fruits, which are much rounder - apples to the other's pear - and smaller. These are good, too - no, fantastic, a gift - but familiarity has bred a little contempt. The other is the first fruit of that tree and I am jubilant, claiming credit where absolutely none is due. These are Cydonia oblonga, not chaenomeles, although the latter will make edible fruit as a by-product of its flowers. But cydonia makes trees, and although the blossom is as good as any chaenomeles imaginable, that is the warm-up act, presaging the real thing that is the fruit.</p> <p>The single quince is 'Vranja', which is the most upright of the four varieties I have been growing. The fruit is very large, but then if a tree has only one fruit to put its energy into, it ought to be a whopper. According to my garden diary, I bought the tree on 6 November 1997, but it only reached this final position in the garden two years ago, which was its third move in five years, so no wonder it had refrained from fruiting until now. But in theory, 'Vranja' is an early cropper and one of the few quinces that can be trained successfully against a wall as a fan shape.</p> <p>The tree laden with fruit is 'Lescovacz'. Two years ago it had 47 fruits, but last year not one, despite an incredible blossoming. Quince blossom is the best of all - a sugar pink that is never sickly. It comes late and stays for too short a time but is always breathtakingly beautiful. This year there must be more than 60 fruits. </p> <p>We still have plenty of the membrillo that I made with the bulk of the crop two years ago, which is a coarse but delicious sweetmeat that is ideal with a smoky cheese, game or added to a gravy. But a little of it goes quite a long way, so maybe I should make marmalade and wine this time, although I have just found another marmelo recipe that involves boiling the fruit in wine and honey rather than a sugar solution, which sounds worth trying. The edible point about quince is that it is aromatically, deliciously sweet but this only reveals itself, in the northern hemisphere at least, when cooked. It also has a great deal of pectin, so jellies easily and therefore can be stored conveniently. This is a kind of alchemy and the tree has always been revered as being magically benign. In fact, eating quince has been in decline ever since cane sugar became popularly available and the idea of preserving fruit became a chore rather than a stored-up treat.</p> <p>My other trees are 'Champion' and 'Portugal'. 'Champion' has a roundish fruit; 'Portugal' has more oblong, irregular pear-shaped fruit, almost orange and very woolly with down, and are early to ripen - if they appear. I see a quote that says it is 'slow to start bearing and a shy cropper'. Shyness is potentially attractive but something in the fruit line would be nice soonish. The down is part of their odd, rather confusing charm, even though to the uninitiated it can look like a virulent mould. Just rub it off before cooking.</p> <p>Growing quinces successfully depends upon rich, wet soil, although Jane Grigson says they do well in 'the driest of upland fields and the hottest of small village gardens' in France. Certainly they need sunshine, but don't gamble on the dry-upland bit. If you have a wet patch of ground they will reward you for it. Order or buy a quince now (it is worth shopping around the net and nurseries for the variety you want) and plant it between now and March. Plant it like any other fruit tree - with care but not reverence, digging a wide, but not too deep hole, loosening the subsoil and adding no organic material below the roots but plenty as a mulch on the surface in a 1m-radius around the tree. It will need staking for its first three years but no special care or pruning again in its life other than keeping it weed-free.</p> <p>Quince trees are self-fertile - so you can have just one and expect it to fruit - and grown on their own rootstock. Pears are almost inevitably grown on quince roots as well. This keeps pears small, whereas on its own roots a pear tree wants to become a large, even magnificent tree, more like a full-grown ash or beech than a back-garden bush. Quince tames and reduces it with three possible measures of quince-vigour 'A', 'B' or 'C'. A few pear varieties, such as 'Williams' Bon Chr\u00e9tien', are incompatible with quince and have to have an intermediary graft or 'interstock' to connect the rootstock with the scion which is compatible with both quince and pear. This is called 'double-worked' and makes the tree more expensive, as it adds a year on to its nursery life. </p> <p>On its own roots, quince is sprawly and gangly and it is a waste of time trying to clip or prune it to your preconceived ideas of beauty. Go with it. Be astonished at the blossom. </p> <p>Be unreasonably proud of the fruit. Drink in the incredible fragrance with which a single quince can seduce a room and feast on its pomaded sweetness. It will, I promise, brighten your northern sky.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:monty.don@observer.co.uk\">monty.don@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Dusk in Kabul, and the sky is turning purple over the hills that rim the horizon around the city. Fluorescent lights flare green and red above a crowd and a stage. In the photograph, the crowd is fluid, its movement blurred by the long exposure. What the camera cannot capture is the wonderful, ethereal sounds of Farhad Darya, the legendary Afghan musician who had returned from exile in Canada to perform for the first time for years at the national stadium in Kabul this May.</p> <p>Six years before, I had sat on the stadium's concrete steps on a Friday afternoon. It was a pleasant summer's day, a weak sun lit the grey terraces, and the sky was the washed-out, eggshell blue peculiar to Kabul. Hawkers moved among listless spectators. I watched as doctors amputated the hands of two thieves. Then a man was made to squat by the penalty spot and was shot in the head. Once the blood and brains had been cleared away, there was a football match between teams from Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad. </p> <p>In the winter of 2000 I was back in the stadium. This time, a woman was executed. She had been convicted of battering her husband to death with a hammer, a crime that I remember thinking would meet with a similar punishment in many countries in the world, including the US. She crouched in her blue burqa, its fringe tugged by the breeze, looking over her shoulder like a nervous child. I remember hearing the long metallic scrape of the bolt on the executioner's AK47 being drawn back, clearly audible in the hush, and I can remember the three rounds that rang out, the dust that kicked up as the first two travelled through the woman's head, and then the fragments of skull that flew forward. </p> <p>Those days are gone. Two weeks ago Afghans voted in a presidential election, pretty much the only more or less free and fair poll ever held in the country. Holding the election was largely symbolic, but wonderful to see nonetheless. Most people voted on traditional lines - for whoever their village headman or husband or father determined. But at least it was an election. </p> <p>There are no longer executions in Kabul stadium. And many of the seemingly extraordinary restrictions the Taliban imposed on the capital have gone, present only in an odd sort of reverse image, like a photographic negative, when people do what was previously banned.</p> <p>Kabul has been transformed since the days when the Taliban were in control. In those days, traffic was minimal. A few old Soviet-built Volgas or imported Toyota Corollas bounced over the pitted streets. There was one half-decent restaurant where huge piles of steaming pulau and kebabs were served and senior Taliban officials sat on long greasy cushions with their catamites and their automatic weapons beside them. There was one hotel with six functioning rooms. The polytechnic was a minefield. At night, the intermittent electricity flickered on and off in a few favoured sections of the city. The rest was left in chill darkness.</p> <p>In contrast to today's bars, restaurants and thriving expat social scene, the international presence in the city was limited to a few NGOs, the UN, a handful of reporters and an increasing number of Arab, Pakistani or Central Asian militants. Often I was the only Western journalist in the country. Afghanistan was a decrepit global cul-de-sac. </p> <p>The Taliban's rule in Kabul, from 1996 to 2001, is now generally considered the epitome of fundamentalist Muslim repression. But the Taliban regime and its seemingly irrational social regulations can be better understood if seen in the context of Afghanistan in the mid- to late Nineties.</p> <p>For all their failings, the Taliban brought security to many areas where there was none. Impositions that were shocking in the cities were not impositions at all in the vast majority of Afghanistan. In the dusty hill villages of Paktia or Oruzgan province, of Ghor or Faryab, women had never gone to school or travelled without a burqa. Nor was the ban on televisions much of an issue. There weren't any.</p> <p>The Taliban's security meant that when, crippled by an enormous hangover, I left a wallet containing my passport and $1,500 on a bus, it was returned intact. It meant you could hail a cab and go virtually anywhere, provided you took the precaution of first checking in with the local warlord or Taliban official (often the same person). I slept in villages, military bases, the occasional fly-blown hotel, or in chai khannas, the roadside inns where tea and food (chai and khanna) are served to travellers. In one, just outside the town of Qalat on the road between Kabul and Kandahar, I woke at dawn to find everyone, guests and staff, lined up in the dust of the road for dawn prayers. I lay wrapped in blankets and watched them. It was an insight into the depth of local piety. Imagine a Travelodge on the M4 emptying into the car park for prayers at 4am. This was not fundamentalism or extremism. It was simply an expression of a faith that articulates every part of life. It was also an example of something that is often forgotten in analyses of the Taliban and of Afghanistan: the profound difference between Kabul and the rest of the country. </p> <p>No one in the West took much notice of the Taliban until they arrived in the capital and began imposing their infamous bans - on weather forecasting, representations of living things, leather jackets and 'Western hairstyles', pigeon racing, kite flying and most other forms of entertainment. Yet the reasoning behind this extreme rigour deserves understanding and even, controversial though it may be to say so, a degree of sympathy.</p> <p>Many Taliban had seen their families destroyed, their fathers killed, their fields deliberately despoiled, their culture splintered and their homeland sucked into a welter of violence. And if they hadn't witnessed it themselves, they had been told during their childhood in their stinking, seething refugee camps in Pakistan about the devastation wrought by the war with the Soviets in the Eighties. The attraction of the clear certainties of a rigorous interpretation of Islam to those steeped in such chaos is easy to comprehend. They believed that all that had gone wrong in their lives could be attributed to modernity, to newness, to change. They wanted a revolution in the original sense of the word, a turning back of the clock. There was a blackness, a trauma, at the heart of the Taliban movement. Outside the Ministry of Religious Affairs, I once saw a painted slogan: 'Every breath is a breath closer to death.' A year later it had been replaced with: 'Throw reason to the dogs. It stinks of corruption.'</p> <p>There was a perversely logical rationale behind the bans. The Taliban imagined the life they had lost as an idealised version of rural tribal society. That life, with its supposed purity and social justice, could be enjoyed once more if everybody followed the Shariat, the corpus of Islamic law, particularly where it intersected with local traditions that were threatened by change. And if people didn't want to, then for the greater good of all, they needed to be forced to. </p> <p>Thus all the injunctions: women could not go out without a close relative (effectively preventing them from working), men had to wear beards of a specific length, anything that detracted from prayer or religious observance had to be shunned. Secularism, cosmopolitanism, gender equality (and rule by non-Pashtuns) all had come from Kabul. And while the provinces had suffered terribly during the Soviet war, Kabul had done quite well, with big aid programmes, building schemes, cafes and cinemas, girls in miniskirts, imported films. The city dwellers were seen as collaborators. Kabul, to the rural Taliban, was Babylon and its women were the whores. And the Taliban behaved accordingly. </p> <p>As the years of their rule progressed, and their international isolation deepened, the Taliban drew closer to the Gulf-based strands of Islam followed by men like Osama bin Laden. Even as late as 1998 the Taliban were almost astonishingly simplistic. Bored, waiting for an interview with the minister for religious affairs, I once asked his guards, a detachment of religious police charged with enforcing the minister's harsh edicts, if I could join them. They looked me up and down and then conferred. Of course, they said, if I really wanted to. There followed another debate. One came over and shyly asked if I was a Muslim. No, I told him and asked if that was a problem. He looked grave and spoke to his colleagues again. A minute later he returned, all smiles. No problem, he told me, if I came with them to the mosque for dawn prayers the next day I could convert and there would be no trouble at all. </p> <p>There were, of course, far darker elements to the Taliban's regime. Arbitrary beatings were regularly meted out. Ethnic minorities, especially the Hazaras from the centre and west of the country, were cleansed from much of the city. The plains to the north were effectively razed. Once they had been the bread basket for the capital, spotted with beautiful villages set among orchards and vineyards. By the time of the war of 2001 they were wastelands, populated by thin, haunted, hunted people. </p> <p>Things are better now, as these photographs reflect. At least, they are in Kabul. Women are still dying without medical attention because their menfolk refuse to take them to hospital, but large numbers of girls are educated, there are women police officers, men can have their beards cut, the university is full, the mines have been cleared from the polytechnic, there are international flights to destinations throughout Europe and Asia from the city airport, cinemas have reopened to show the hugely popular Bollywood musicals (and Western pornography). Though in most of Afghanistan the misogyny and repression of centuries past continues almost unaltered, this is a start at least. </p> <p>The shame is that the attention of the world is now drifting elsewhere. Last November, I wandered through the hospital in Kandahar, the main city in southeastern Afghanistan. The sound of steady sobbing echoed through empty rooms. In one wing I found children dying of malnutrition. </p> <p>A handwritten sign stuck up in a corner told me I had found the 'therapoetic feeding centre'. The bathos was terrible. Two years after their country had been invaded by the world's richest and most powerful state, five-year-olds were starving to death. </p> <p>A few days later I drove out to the village of Sangesar, where the Taliban had been founded 10 years ago. I spoke to the locals gathered for Friday prayers at the mosque where Mullah Omar, the reclusive one-eyed cleric who led the movement, once preached. Did they want the Taliban back, I asked. No, they said. They wanted a well. </p> <p>During Taliban times there was a man who rode an old Russian motorbike around a rickety wooden 'wall of death' in Ariana Square in the centre of Kabul. He rarely drew much of a crowd and it was hazardous work. The bike was barely fast enough to maintain the momentum to keep him from crashing to the floor. I saw him a few times. I wonder what happened to him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Afghanaid is an independent UK-based charity that has worked alongside Afghan communities for two decades.

  "<p>Adam Curtis likes a challenge. Eighteen months ago he proposed a new series of documentary films for the BBC. The films, he explained to his bosses, would be about the philosophical ideas behind conservatism. As a pitch, he concedes, it was 'about the dullest of all subjects you can imagine'. In these days of docusoaps and reality stunts it says just about everything you need to know about Curtis's brilliance as a filmmaker that he was commissioned to make the series at all. The BBC's faith has been more than rewarded, however, by The Power of Nightmares , the first part of which went out on Wednesday. </p> <p>Curtis's original idea led him in typically unexpected directions. In particular, to developing a fearful symmetry between American neoconservative thought and Islamic fundamentalism. In looking back he discovered that the progenitors of each of these movements - the American political philosopher Leo Strauss, and the Egyptian revolutionary Sayyid Qutb - had been responding to similar observations. They had both been at American universities just after the Second World War - Strauss as a professor, Qutb as a student - and what they had seen there had convinced them that within American prosperity lay the seeds of its moral destruction. </p> <p>'Everyone was thinking Truman's America is great and these two completely obscure figures were looking at it, in 1949, and thinking no, there is something wrong with this; they were both pessimists. We now live in a world that is shaped partly by the results of their thinking.' </p> <p>From this beginning, Curtis went on to deconstruct the ways in which the governments of America and Britain in particular had seized upon fear as a way of connecting with their population, and presents the war on terror as a product of this thinking. 'What I am saying,' he says, 'is that I don't think al-Qaeda exists in the way that we have been asked to understand it. There are awful atrocities, of course, and there is militant Islamic fundamentalism. But the idea of a global network of terror run by Osama bin Laden, unique in its threat, which we have been told about for three years now is, I believe, a myth. I have backed this belief up with ideas that I think show the reasons why this myth has been created.' </p> <p>To understand Curtis's methods in presenting these arguments you have to understand a little of his background. Now 50, he set out teaching politics at Oxford, but got bored with the isolation of that. He decided to work instead in TV and got his first job on Esther Rantzen's That's Life . He found dogs that could sing, researched investigative segments. Along the way he learned a lot about comic timing and the ways an audience might be engaged by issues. 'The best lesson that Esther taught me was that people who think they are funny rarely are,' he says. </p> <p>When he got to make his own documentaries on more serious subjects, he attempted to integrate some of this training with the BBC tradition of documentary-making inspired by his hero James Mossman. His first successful attempt at this was The Road to Terror, a film which intercut footage from the Iranian revolution with material from movies about the French revolution, and with incongruous music. Alan Yentob, who had just become BBC2 controller, loved the playfulness of this, and encouraged Curtis to apply his sense of mischief to the weightiest of subjects, mixing high seriousness and impeccable journalism with an extreme lightness of touch. </p> <p>If there has been a theme in Curtis's work since, it has been to look at how different elites have tried to impose an ideology on their times, and the tragi-comic consequences of those attempts. In his series Pandora's Box he examined the apocalyptic political fallout of nuclear science. In The Mayfair Set , he looked at how buccaneer capitalists were allowed to shape the climate of the Thatcher years. And in The Century of the Self he traced the ways in which Freud had been used to generate the triumph of Western consumerism. </p> <p>The fun and surprise of his films is the footage that he uncovers to support his mesmerising essays. The first part of the current series featured not only pertinent clips from Gunsmoke, but also bravura material from Donald Rumsfeld's days as Defence Secretary in the Seventies, talking up the Soviet threat, just as he now talks up the unprecedented danger of bin Laden's terror networks. Curtis has a remarkable feel for the serendipity of such moments, and an obsessive skill in locating them. 'That kind of footage shows just how dull I can be,' he admits, a little glumly. 'The BBC has an archive of all these tapes where they have just dumped all the news items they have ever shown. One tape for every three months. So what you get is this odd collage, an accidental treasure trove. You sit in a darkened room, watch all these little news moments, and look for connections.' </p> <p>He likes to think his approach to documentary shares something with the method of a 19th-century novelist. 'You look at Bleak House, say, and Dickens throws 10 strands of news stories together and sees where they lead him. I love the idea of that.' </p> <p>In this way, led partly by curiosity and chance, Curtis leaves his films open to possibility. 'Journalism traditionally is done in specialisms,' he says, 'but the interesting thing in the modern world is that different things impinge on each other in unexpected ways.' By cutting at almost subliminal speed between news footage and pop cultural references, academic interviews and fragments of film noir, Curtis's films recreate exactly that sense of juxtaposition and seem close to the way we experience the world. </p> <p>Thus his history of Islamic fundamentalism begins with an observation Sayyid Qutb made while at a dance in America in 1949, watching 'decadent' young Americans smooch. The song that was playing was 'Baby, it's Cold Outside'. 'That song,' says Curtis, 'was really what made me want to make the film. It was a tune which in itself was responding to postwar anxieties. And Qutb watches people dance to that song and he has these thoughts about the moral emptiness of capitalism. The beginning of thoughts about how he might change the world.' That, Curtis thought, is like the start of a novel. </p> <p>His own journey from that point was based on two specific kinds of faith. First in the power of narrative, of one extraordinary thing leading to another. And second in the intellectual curiosity of his viewers. 'If you can get from a church dance in 1949, to the assassination of President Sadat within an hour, and you fill in a lot of the gaps between, then I think people will watch that.' </p> <p>Most of all he remains firm in his unfashionable belief that our world is shaped by big ideas. 'I found out that Sayyid Qutb and Leo Strauss had both deduced from Nietzsche the way that liberal society was heading: towards nihilism. The real basis of my films is that Nietzsche's ideas have shaped the world we live in, but in totally unpredictable ways.' Imagine trying to sell that to the marketing people. </p> <p>At the heart of his argument is the proposal that Blair and Bush have, deliberately or not, exaggerated the current danger to give themselves a new connection to their voters. 'The war between good and evil gives them a purpose. Blair has a temperamental sense of imagining the worst. What the films begin to show, though, is that they are protecting us against a myth.' </p> <p>His third film in particular, he acknowledges, may expose Curtis to similar charges of naivety, in its assertion that al-Qaeda, as a global terror network, is a convenient political illusion. He has a ready response to politicians and spooks who may suggest he does not know the half of it. 'If they want our trust, they should trust us in return. Stop whispering to friendly journalists about this unknown terror, tell us the basis of your fear. Because I have looked for it, and I can't find it. If you examine the figures, they have not found any evidence of a hidden network in three years. They have managed to convict three people by association with Islamist groups. The majority of people who have been arrested under the new laws in that period are Irish terrorists.' </p> <p>In making this case, Curtis has produced the most provocative piece of television that the BBC has shown since the Hutton inquiry. He says that he sees at close quarters how 'BBC people are terrified often of doing politics'. But also how actually that seems to be flying in the face of what people want. 'Politics are actually \"cool\" right now; the trick is to try to do them in a new way. People come into TV at 25 or so, they are interested in politics, but they are told they have to do things like they were done 20 years ago, boring graphics, talking heads. It is as if nobody has ever seen The Day Today .' </p> <p>Curtis gave a lecture to the BBC bosses once; Greg Dyke called him in to address his 'central command unit'. What he argued was that as a corporation they had stopped explaining things. 'Events come at us in emotional waves and we let that happen.' Worse, he believes, that method has also started to be applied to the past. 'You go back to the Brighton Bomb, and you make it a human interest story. You take away the fact that this is actually part of a dispute over particular ideas and the result of particular politics.' </p> <p>News, he believes, must be run by people who can maintain a strict sense of questioning distance. 'If you report things emotionally it immediately depoliticises them. No one gets judged, little gets fully understood.' </p> <p>Still Curtis is under no illusion that he is moving against a powerful prevailing culture. 'They pulled some of the trails for my series out of respect for the family of Kenneth Bigley,' he says. 'What kind of madness is that? If a bomb went off here tomorrow, I have no doubt they would pull the series itself. They have discussed that. My rational argument would be immediately that this does not defeat my point in any way. There are of course bad people in the world who have bombs. But that does not justify the scale of the fear that currently possesses people. We have been prepared by politicians and the media to expect nightmares, even to need them. If nothing else we need to get a grip.' </p> <p>As good a place as any to start, in this respect, is with the second film in Curtis's series, on BBC2 this Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>Football attracts plenty of negative publicity, a lot of it justified. Tales of greed and corruption, of excess by overpaid young men and irresponsible older men, of tantrums, takeovers and ticket prices. But it is not all like that. I had first-hand experience last week of the good a Premiership football club can do when they put their heart to it. And Charlton certainly do that. </p> <p>This story started in 2001, when Southwark Police, an inner-city division of London's Metropolitan Police, were given a brief to support the police in the township of Alexandra, South Africa. Alexandra is a long-forgotten community sprawling in the shadow of Soweto, its better-known sister township. Soweto is like Mayfair compared to Alexandra, an upside-down world where cholera and Aids, domestic violence and child abuse are daily hazards. One in two adults is unemployed, one in four is HIV-positive and more than 90 per cent of children live with physical or sexual abuse. </p> <p>This is a context you have to comprehend to appreciate the impact of 'Lesedi La Bokamosa - Looking to the Future', a project conceived and delivered by the phenomenal partnerships of the Metropolitan Police, the South African Police Service, Charlton Athletic FC and British Airways. PC David Snow, a Charlton fan who works in Southwark, dropped in at The Valley in 2002 shortly before heading off to South Africa. With two South Africa players, Shaun Bartlett and Mark Fish, playing for Charlton, PC Snow thought the club might be interested in contributing to the police scheme. He ended up with more than 100 boxes of football kit, balls and coaching equipment. 'We had so much, we contacted British Airways to see if they could get it on the flight,' he says. 'By coincidence, it turned out they had a community project working in the township of Alexandra.' </p> <p>The Met and BA brought in Charlton's community football coaches and the John Cabot College, Bristol, to talk about a joint effort. Two teachers from the college were enlisted to deliver educational sessions in Alexandra on citizenship, community, health and dental hygiene. BA agreed to meet travel costs, so Lesedi La Bokamosa came into being in 2003. </p> <p>After a decade of pioneering community work in south-east London, Charlton have extensive expertise in using football to enhance the lives of young people in a community where youth crime is prevalent. All Premiership clubs run schemes for football in the community and Charlton lead the way with more than 50 full-time staff, eight times more than any other club.</p> <p>Last week, the Charlton coaches yet again visited the township. I was there, with my Sussex County Cricket Club vice-captain, Charlotte Burton, to offer cricket sessions to complement the football and educational workshops. </p> <p>The days were split into two. From nine until noon we visited schools, then headed to the Three Squares Facility, alias the Sheeps' Head Stadium, so named because of the cooking taking place on open fires around the fence. This rocky, dusty grass area, roughly the size of a football pitch, had a neatly run pavilion and a newly laid basketball court. Each day we coached 350 children aged between nine and 12. </p> <p>Alongside the football and cricket coaching and the educational classes held by the Bristol teachers was the coaching of coaches: 20 adult volunteers undertaking an FA course. </p> <p>Given the chaos of Alexandra, I was staggered how smoothly the days ran. Most schools have only one football and I did not see a cricket bat all week. We had come prepared, however, and one legacy of the scheme is that we were able to leave a vast amount of football and cricket equipment. </p> <p>The smiles on so many faces will stay in my memory for a long time. But smiles do not last. As with any charitable undertaking, creating something permanent is the key to success. Charlton's community liaison officer, Ben Tegg, says: 'This project isn't about finding the next Mark Fish or Shaun Bartlett. It's about focusing on coaching the coaches in this deprived community. That's where we can make the most difference. Long after we've left, these coaches can continue to train thousands more players and identify budding talent.' </p> <p>The past six months are testament to Tegg's vision. Eighteen male and female volunteers from Alexandra were awarded their FA level one coaching certificate last year, so more than 12,000 children from the township have benefited from football coaching since March, a remarkable success story. Charlton chairman Martin Simons, one of the team of 28 who worked on the project in the township, was as hands-on as the rest of us. 'This is not a flash in the pan charity handout,' he says. 'To return to Alexandra a year on and see last year's coaches still hard at it proves that this scheme works and can last. </p> <p>The number of children - 30 per cent of them girls - who now have football in their lives is staggering. I am so proud of these coaches, who have not earned a cent along the way.' </p> <p><strong> THE MONEY BEHIND</strong> the scheme has mostly come from the Foreign Office but will not be there indefinitely. The next aim is to find a major sponsor. 'The coaches are unpaid - that's got to change if they are to stay motivated and if we are to encourage more members of their community to be involved,' says Simons. 'We ultimately need to be able to hand this over to the community of Alexandra on a practical level. The police in Alexandra are vital in the future of this project; their role in this crime-ridden environment must be to facilitate the work of the coaches, to direct them into the corners of the township where sport is so needed.' </p> <p>We saw only a few of those corners during the week of our visit and we saw only a small percentage of those who wake up to life in those corners. I walked away feeling uplifted. Not by that short-lived, essentially selfish feeling that sometimes accompanies 'charity work' but in the knowledge that Lesedi La Bokamosa genuinely is looking to the future. </p> <p>Football can feel proud of Charlton.</p>",
  "<p>Jens Lehmann does not go along with the old-fashioned theory that you have to be mad to be a goalkeeper, but he accepts that irrationality is part of the deal. 'If you always thought rationally, you would never dive at an attacker's feet,' the Arsenal goalkeeper says. 'You have to lose control in certain situations and not worry about getting kicked in the head. Goalkeeping is sometimes like an extreme sport. You have to let yourself go.' </p> <p>The Germany player certainly returned to Highbury to some extreme headlines last week, after his confident but misjudged forays from his line cost Arsenal two goals and two points against Panathinaikos in Athens. It was not the first time Lehmann had slipped up in the Champions League, either, and with Tim Howard in Manchester United's reserves after losing Sir Alex Ferguson's confidence, both teams taking part in the biggest Premiership game so far this season at Old Trafford today are said to be in the market for new goalkeepers. </p> <p>Yet if Lehmann is a liability, as his detractors complain, he saves most of his blunders for Europe. </p> <p>The 34-year-old former Borussia Dortmund player is the enigma at the heart of Arsenal's record-breaking unbeaten run. He has played in all but two of the 49 Premiership matches, the sequence having started at the end of the 2002-03 season before he arrived at Highbury. It means that he has played in 47 consecutive games, something none of the other Arsenal players has done. He has been at Highbury almost a season and a half and has yet to experience defeat in the Premiership, which is no mean feat for a so-called dodgy keeper. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, publicly at any rate, argues that Lehmann contributes enough positives to the team to outweigh any lapses. There is no doubt that his assertiveness and usually effective interventions allow Arsenal to play farther up the pitch. That, in its turn, has helped Arsenal to evolve into the sort of team who do not worry about going a goal down because they know that they can always score one or more at the other end. </p> <p>But there can be little doubt, either, that Lehmann is viewed as one of Arsenal's few weak links and there is increasing evidence that opponents are attempting to play on his weaknesses. Lehmann's shot-stopping ability, positioning and preference for punching rather than catching are legitimate avenues for opponents to explore, although many have cottoned on to the fact that his temperament might be his biggest vulnerability. Lehmann has been known to lose his temper, and with it his concentration, and having complained early on that he was surprised at the physicality of the English game, he gets a regular bumping and bruising at corners and free-kicks. </p> <p>The most recent time Arsenal were in Manchester, three weeks ago, City manager Kevin Keegan sent Richard Dunne forward at set pieces to make his considerable presence felt in close proximity to the goalkeeper. When David James went up for the last corner of the game and jumped straight into his opposite number, Wenger was moved to protest on Lehmann's behalf. </p> <p>'People are going overboard, Jens is entitled to more protection,' Wenger said. 'It is fair enough jumping for the ball, but people are not playing the ball, they are playing Jens and that's a foul.' </p> <p>Lehmann has said the same - 'The hardest thing to get used to in England was everyone attacking me, not the ball, and the ref never whistling' - but has learnt the sad truth that moaning only marks him out for more attention. </p> <p>For all his midweek miscalculations, Lehmann has at least proved more consistent and resilient than Howard, the United goalkeeper who won all the plaudits after two saves in a penalty shoot-out when both players made their debuts in the English game in the 2003 Community Shield. The American looked a real find but became erratic towards the end of last season and Ferguson lost patience after he was directly responsible for conceding the first goal away to Lyon last month. </p> <p>That match ended 2-2, as did Arsenal's in Athens last week, but whereas Lehmann can ride out the occasional mistake, Ferguson decided that Howard's unpredictability was making his defence twitchy. Roy Carroll is not the most nerveless and dependable of performers, either, and Ferguson has shown a reluctance to give him an extended run in the first team, but he made some important saves in Prague on Tuesday and is in the side on merit. </p> <p>His Premiership record is more broken than Lehmann's, but it bears comparison. He has lost only once in 27 appear ances and believes that Arsenal can be denied. 'We don't care how many goals they have scored,' he says. 'The way we are defending at the moment, there's no reason we can't keep a clean sheet.' </p> <p>The oddest aspect of the whole story, perhaps, with question marks over the goalkeeping roles at Old Trafford and Highbury, is that the apparent future of English goalkeeping changed hands in the summer for the modest sum of \u00a31.5million. Tottenham probably cannot believe their luck, especially since Paul Robinson has moved so adeptly into the England role within the past couple of months. </p> <p>United continue to be linked with everyone from Carlo Cudicini to Iker Casillas, while Arsenal are thought to fancy Norwich's England prospect, Robert Green, yet under everyone's noses Spurs got the snip of the summer from the great Leeds giveaway. And they did not even have a manager at the time. If Carroll or Lehmann gives a goal away today - a possibility that cannot be discounted - questions will have to be asked.</p>",
  "<p>Thinking of doing something different? Well, in that case, learn from those who have gone before you.

Looking back, Murrell says: 'I wish I had calculated just how dramatically changing careers would affect my finances. I did do the sums and in quite a lot of detail, but I was still surprised.

I would also recommend saving enough money to buy some time to find the right job, rather than just having to take the first thing offered to you because money has become tight.

The one thing the 43-year-old wishes he knew then was 'just how hard studying really is. You tend to believe that it's easy. But it's not. It's really demanding. And there are no short cuts. If you need that piece of paper, you've got to go out and get it. And you tend to forget the stress of all that - until you try to do it again. And when you do, you can suddenly find yourself feeling afraid. You've taken a risk and now you're wondering if you're going to be able to pull it off.

The one thing Withers would have loved to have known at the beginning of her career change was just how long it would take to get herself up and running in her new profession. 'It can take much longer than you expect,' says the 42-year-old. 'Even once you've retrained and researched the opportunities available to you, there can still be a long wait before people give you the chance you need to start afresh. I suggest you be prepared to really prove yourself to people.

I was prepared for them. But there is the theory in your head and then there is the reality. And the difference between the two was quite something. But, and this is the thing, you do adapt. And you do adjust.

He says: 'I would have felt better at the time I made the change if I had known where best to put my faith. When you experience a lot of uncertainty it's natural to worry, and yet all of the minor panics come and go and are forgotten, replaced by new ones. I wish I'd been able to trust that even though things might not turn out exactly as planned, I would, somehow, find a way. My advice to others would be to see changing careers as like going for a drive: pack basic repair essentials but then get on and enjoy the open road, knowing that if something does go wrong, you'll be able to cope.' </p> <p><strong>What a lot I could do, if I had a little money...</strong></p> <p>You need to fund your ambition.

  "<p>MG Rover, the beleaguered carmaker, will this week admit to a disastrous yearly performance after seeing heavy losses following a massive slump in sales. </p> <p>Despite the continued failure of the Longbridge-based company to meet its often postponed break-even targets, a handful of its directors are set to receive a payment of about \u00a34 million into a controversial trust fund that was set up to provide retirement benefits. Last year five directors - including the original 'Phoenix Four' led by John Towers who took over the business from BMW in 2000, benefited from a \u00a312.95m payment into the fund. </p> <p>The payments brought accusations that directors were asset-stripping the business - although these were contested by Towers and his colleagues, Peter Beale, Nick Stephenson and John Edwards. </p> <p>This year's figure is lower because it covers a single year, while the \u00a312.9m covered the first two-and-a-half years of Phoenix Venture Holdings owning the group. </p> <p>The 2003 accounts, due out on Thursday, will reveal a loss of about \u00a370m, reflecting an improvement on the 2002 deficit of \u00a395m and continuing the annual reduction in red ink since 2000. But while it will not make a specific earnings forecast for 2004, the company will say that it will not continue this trend in 2004 and that losses will bounce back up again because of a very difficult trading environment. </p> <p>Rover sales suffered crippling decline in the last two reported months - August and September - falling by more than a third in each month compared with the previous year. The September drop is particularly damaging for the company because it is seen as a crucial month for sales throughout the industry.

  "<p>'I'm trying to bridge art and commerce,' mumbled Ian Schrager in a heavy Brooklyn drawl while sipping an iced Coke in the bar of his stylish St Martin's Lane hotel in London's West End. 'I'm still looking for my masterpiece.' </p> <p>The 58-year-old hotelier describes himself as 'a home-run hitter'. In other words his projects don't fiddle round the edges. They make an impact. </p> <p>This is no exaggeration. It was Schrager who jointly founded and ran New York's Studio 54 which, in the Seventies, was the world's most famous nightclub and disco's holy shrine of hedonistic excess. Following a year in jail for tax evasion, he went on to redefine hotels with a blend of nightclub chic and provocative, ironic design. </p> <p>Schrager, with his French partner Philippe Starck, tapped into nascent wannabe celebrity culture, created the first boutique hotels and made lobbies a place to be seen in. But today there is a big question he has to face up to: Is he past it or is there something left to bring to the party? </p> <p>His business empire has hit a crossroads. His nine luxury hotels are only just emerging from serious financial difficulties. But if the Brooklyn-born law graduate can create a new genre in entertainment it would see the 58-year-old hotelier emerge triumphant as perhaps the most vivid encapsulation of style and commerce over the last 30 years. </p> <p>In his first newspaper interview since his difficulties emerged, Schrager appears chastened, but has no doubt about his place in the scheme of things: 'I'm in the opportunity business. I started in hotels responding to the opportunity. When I sold Studio 54, I was given an IOU. \"What have you got?\" \"A hotel.\" I took it. We traded.' </p> <p>The trading shows no sign of stopping now. Schrager is gearing up for a new phase. Whether it follows the template he masterminded from his backroom at Studio 54 - the media frenzy, the celeb clientele, the smart design - is unclear. That reached a glittering lucrative climax in the manic run-up to the new millennium, when it was said that his hotel empire rang up profits of \u00a3120m. </p> <p>But the party gave way to a mighty hangover. The dotcom bubble burst, planes flew into New York buildings and George Bush invaded Iraq. The hotel market has been on its knees since. </p> <p>For Schrager, the pummelling was severe. Bank covenants of $355m were breached last year and his hotel in San Francisco, the Clift, filed for bankruptcy protection. </p> <p>Media reports over the last year have centred on whether style gurus have tired of his creations; his space eaten away by imitators. Schrager acknowledges imitation and has a word for it: 'Schragerisation'. But he insists only a 'visionary and not a functionary' can carry it off. 'I don't mean that to sound...' Arrogant? 'It's not arrogant.' </p> <p>Schrager is undoubtedly a tough nut. And he is in town to put the record straight. After a year's silence, his message is that he is back and soaking up new influences. Trips to Istanbul and Croatia are feeding the muse. Ecleticism and bohemia is where it's at, he reckons. Far harder to imitate than minimalism. </p> <p>Travelling the world, Schrager is only taking on projects that take his fancy. He is working on hotel projects in New York with new design partners, John Pawson and multimedia artist Julian Schnabel. He has commissioned Herzog and De Meuron to build the first major new building in New York for years. Those who know him say he should do more in Europe. 'He doesn't realise how successful he could be there,' said one business partner. </p> <p>As for financial difficulties, Schrager says they are behind him. His bank debt has been refinanced. The Clift has emerged from bankruptcy protection with 'creditors getting 100 cents in the dollar'. Its demise was 'an embarrassing mistake that should never have happened', brought on by the downturn in Silicon Valley's dotcom industry. The Clift is ringfenced from his other assets. </p> <p>Now he is engaged in the sale of his two London hotels, the Sanderson and St Martin's Lane. The timing could hardly be better. The London market is on the march again after three years in the doldrums. Room occupancy rates are rising. US businessmen and tourists are returning. London is, for obvious reasons, their only European destination. </p> <p>Hotels were further rejuvenated by the \u00a3750m sale of the Savoy Group by US investor Blackstone to an Irish consortium. This deal worked out at more than \u00a31m per room. And a wall of money from overseas investors is beating a path to London to buy up trophy assets. </p> <p>For more than a year, Schrager's hotel business partner, the property firm Burford, has been trying to persuade Schrager to sell his two London establishments. Last August he relented. Schrager wants \u00a3200m but associates say anything over \u00a3150m would be a result. Schrager is adamant he will retain management of the hotels. But others say he could be bought out. </p> <p>He grew up in Brooklyn's East Flatbush. From good Jewish middle-class stock, his father - who was big in real estate - would have blanched at the thought of his son making a living running nightclubs. </p> <p>Although if you believe rumours - always flatly denied by Schrager junior - his father was used to living near the edge, with alleged Mob connections. Both parents had died by the time Schrager was 24. They were spared the trauma of his time in jail. It was a time when life was out of control. </p> <p>Studio 54 introduced the world to the purple rope, an 'in-crowd' door policy. It was where Andy Warhol, David Bowie and Mick Jagger partied and Bianca Jagger famously made her entrance on a white horse. It was also where raiding police found $1m in bin bags hidden in the club's ceiling. A further $2.5m was believed to have been 'skimmed'. </p> <p>Prison hit Schrager hard. For months he was held in a maximum-security wing, rubbing shoulders with murderers. He paid inmates to keep him from harm. But prison was in a sense the making of him; he had time to develop his new hotel concept. </p> <p>His colourful life belies his understated manner. But he doesn't miss a trick. 'I used to travel between Boston and New York. The Boston skirts weren't as short as in New York.' </p> <p>Schrager last year flew to Iraq with US General Tommy Franks to 'be a part of history'. He believes the negative portrayal of the war by the New York Times is misguided, but he will back John Kerry when the US goes to the polls next month, citing Bush's mismanagement of the economy as his main reason. </p> <p>His free time is spent with his two daughters Sophia, 10, and Ava, seven. He is divorced from his wife Rita, a former ballet dancer. 'For most of my life, business was my life. I'm 58. I had kids in my late forties. I can afford to be selfless and patient. Maybe 10 years ago I wouldn't have been like that.' </p> <p>He delights in recalling how his elder daughter confessed to him that she can never pre-plan what she is going to wear because it never looks right. Schrager wears a green woollen V-neck over a white T-shirt. 'That's it. I'm the same,' he said, raising his hands like Robert de Niro's brother. </p> <p>But there could be a downside to having Schrager as your dad. His simply furnished, gargantuan 4,000 sq ft apartment in Nolita, that's 'North of Little Italy', is all white, even the curtains. Make a mess at your peril. </p> <p>You wonder if now, at 58, he doesn't tire of the endless demand to create hype; to ensure the kooky product not only enthralls but satisfies demanding customers. 'I will always be doing something. I need to.' Celebrity pals include Madonna, De Niro and Bowie.

  "<b>Furious at 70p Ikea card fee </b> <br> How is Ikea getting away with charging its UK customers extra for using their credit cards? <p>The fee is 70p per transaction and, I was told, started in September. The checkout operator apologised for the inconvenience and suggested that, in future, I use a debit card instead. </p> <p>This is infuriating. The reason most of us use credit cards is that they enable us to spread payments over a month without risking unauthorised overdrafts at the bank. </p> <p>I use my Visa card most days, usually for items costing less than \u00a320. If I were to be charged 70p for every transaction, this would amount to more than \u00a320 a month. Heavy users of credit cards would face even higher charges. The credit card companies must act to prevent other retailers from following Ikea's lead. </p> <p>In the meantime, may I suggest we all surcharge Ikea by imposing our own unofficial \"glassware tax\". We should place an extra set of glasses in our trolleys every time we shop. </p> <p>When the checkout operator mentions the 70p credit card surcharge, we should then leave the unwanted glasses there and pay - by debit card - for the goods we really want. This is likely to cost Ikea more than 70p in extra labour and breakages alone. <br><b>Tony Wilkinson<br> London</b> </p> <p><b>How to make them pay</b><br> John Green asked in Jobs &amp; Money's letters column last week whether fraud was the answer in how to deal with the increasing frustration with various financial service companies. The moral response is of course \"no\" as then you become as evil a \"bottom-dweller\" as them and the politicians. However, I sympathise enormously as he is not alone. </p> <p>Weekly, the level of service provided across sectors I deal with (and pay good money to) from public utilities to financial institutions is shocking and getting seemingly worse. </p> <p>Sometimes even putting up a fight does no good - as I found out this week with losing nearly \u00a3100 to a shower called the Gift Registry who went into administration in early October after a summer of gathering wedding present lists and then failing to deliver said wedding presents to our friends (and I'm sure hundreds of others). My error was paying with Switch upfront. </p> <p>So yes John, change providers of any service until you get one that provides it properly, use credit to the max, where possible default on payments (if there's no penalty) and generally let them chase you until the last moment. And let others pay for you in your old age of course. </p> <p>Stick to the old adage of \"if it looks too good to be true it probably is\" but start acting with the initial thought of \"they'll definitely be getting something out of this deal and almost certainly more than me\". <br><b>Alan Gately<br>Preston, Lancs</b> </p> <p><b> Thanks for teaching me</b><br> Thank you Jobs &amp; Money!

It took me a couple of hours to find the necessary paperwork and put a letter together. </p> <p>This morning I received a cheque from Nationwide for \u00a36,037 for mis-selling me the endowment.

To take one example, consider What a difference 40 years makes by Rupert Jones in the Guardian on October 16. It claims that the value of property has risen by 10.3% per year over the past 40 years and implies that this is a financial rate of return. </p> <p>\".. this finding will cheer people who take the view that property is a safer home for their cash than conventional savings products\". </p> <p>Consider the following: </p> <p>(1) a 1964 house and a 2004 house have very different specifications; it is not a comparison of likes </p> <p>(2) house ownership involves a wide range of costs (eg insurance, maintenance, tax, utilities etc) that do not figure in the 10.3% calculation </p> <p>(3) 2004 is an atypical year since it is a peak in the property cycle. A 1964 to 1999 comparison gives an average annual price increase of only about 8.0% and this is a more meaningful growth figure than your 10.3%. </p> <p>The misleading figures that are often stated in the media do much to stoke up these periodic property bubbles that do so much harm to everyone.

  "I simply don't recognise the South Africa George Monbiot describes (Comment, October 19). The South African government and the South Africans that I know are battling to overcome the legacies of apartheid and build their nation. George sees a South Africa overrun with foreign donors, where the government is either unable to think for itself or does not care about the plight of its people. Yet international aid to South Africa is worth only 0.3% of its GDP. The government has told the IMF it does not want to borrow from it and has restricted the involvement of the World Bank. <p>DfID is working in South Africa on the areas where the government has asked for our assistance, including education, health and the restructuring of public enterprises. In the case of public-private partnerships, it was the South African government that decided to use DfID project funds to advise it on this complex area. The South African treasury decided the terms of reference for the consultants, negotiated on their fees and manages their work, which includes advising on financing for hospital rehabilitation and road building. </p> <p>Contrary to what George says, ASI has not been given \u00a35m to disburse \"as it pleases\". The South African government has made it clear that ASI's role is limited to an advisory one; it is the government that makes policies. It also stipulates the areas where it requires ASI's advice and oversees their work.

  "Young soldiers should expect better protection from the army, a judge said yesterday after jailing a training instructor at the controversial Deepcut barracks for a catalogue of sado-masochistic sexual assaults. <p>Leslie Skinner, 46, who was sentenced to four and a half years, had been given a job at the base despite having a known history of predatory sexual behaviour towards teenage boys. </p> <p>Kingston crown court heard that Skinner had been convicted by a court martial of indecently exposing himself to a 17-year-old boy in the Maze prison in Northern Ireland in 1996. His rank was reduced to private. </p> <p>But rather than being discharged from the army, he was sent to Deepcut, Surrey, the base where police discovered a regime of bullying and inadequate supervision during an inquiry into the apparent suicides of four privates between 1995 and 2002. </p> <p>Judge Charles Tilling, sentencing Skinner, said: \"For some reason best known to itself the army then placed you in a position where you were in contact with and had influence over young recruits. </p> <p>\"Far from heeding the warning that your reduction in rank should have given you, you proceeded to indecently assault another three young vulnerable soldiers. Those who enter the army at that sort of age have and should expect to be able to have protection from this sort of behaviour.\" </p> <p>The judge told Skinner, of Gainsborough, Lincs, who is married with two children aged four and six, that he would be jailed for two years on one count of indecent assault and a further two and a half years for a further four. </p> <p>Skinner had been due to stand trial in September but changed his not guilty plea at the 11th hour and admitted a string of sexual attacks on recruits aged 17 to 19, over several years, beginning in 1992 while he was a staff sergeant at Arnhem barracks, in Aldershot, Hants. </p> <p>His victims were all in the early stages of their army careers and remained silent about the assaults for up to 10 years because they knew Skinner was \"rank\" and in the army you did \"what you are told\". </p> <p>In February 1998 he was court martialled again for indecently assaulting another young recruit, jailed for six months and dishonourably discharged. </p> <p>The scale of Skinner's offences was uncovered two years ago, after one victim saw a BBC Kilroy programme on male rape and contacted police. </p> <p>Surrey police, who were conducting an inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut, began an investigation and during a search of Skinner's home in June 2003 found an album containing photographs of naked young men hidden beneath a floor mat in his car. </p> <p>According to the police, the pictures were taken many years ago, some as far back as 1992. Tracing those concerned proved difficult but eventually four came forward to testify. </p> <p>One victim was forced to strip naked while Skinner beat him with a riding crop. Skinner twice abused another victim in his room at Deepcut while another woke to find him performing a lewd act on him. The final soldier, who was 17, was forced to whip Skinner. </p> <p>The victim of the indecent assault which led to Skinner's second court martial was David Leaning, still a serving officer. </p> <p>Mr Leaning, 26, who gave permission to be named, said of today's sentence: \"I'm as happy as anyone, it's some thing we've all been waiting for for a long time. I never felt justice was done by the army when he was court-martialled and so I'm really happy with the result today.\" </p> <p>Mr Leaning, who is taking the army to court, referring to his own experience at Skinner's hands, said: \"It should never have happened in the first place. After his first incident he should have been kicked out of the army. Putting him in a position of authority in a young persons' environment, this shouldn't have happened. It was neglectful.\" </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence said it was easy to be critical of the decision to send Skinner to Deepcut in 1996, but if a soldier were to be found guilty of the same offence now it would not happen. </p> <p>Surrey police said an investigation failed to prove any link with the deaths of the four soldiers at the base who the army claim committed suicide. </p> <p>\"It was found that Skinner was not at Deepcut at the material times,\" the police said in a statement.</p>",
  "For a generation or more, it has been an article of faith, at least in Europe, that the nation state is in profound decline. The rise of globalisation, growing economic interdependence, the spread of new international organisations and the power of multinationals, not to mention the European Union itself, suggested that the future lay in new forms of global and regional governance. This was a delusion. The opposite is happening. Nation states will be the decisive players in global affairs over the next few decades. <p>So much is already clear with the United States. During the cold war, it behaved as a superpower constrained by its allies. Since 9/11 it has acted as Prometheus unbound, a nation state answerable to nobody but itself. Even if John Kerry is elected president, the US will not revert to its pre-9/11 behaviour. Kerry may emphasise the importance of allies, but the unilateralist instincts of the sole superpower will not be put back in the bottle. </p> <p>The weakness of Europe as a global player is also a reminder of the efficacy of the nation state. Economically, the EU remains a formidable force, rivalling the American economy. As a political player, though, it pales into insignificance in comparison. Unable to act with any decision even in the Balkans, its impotence has been all too transparent over Iraq, where the EU has essentially been reduced to its component parts, most graphically illustrated by the divergent roles of Britain and France. </p> <p>Whatever the lament about the dangers of a European superstate, it is inconceivable that this will change in the foreseeable future. Europe cannot act in concert outside of itself because it is divided into nation states whose interests remain distinct and divergent. The recently expanded union will serve only to make this more true, with the consequence that Europe will continue to be a weak and marginal player in global affairs. </p> <p>Even Iraq is a reminder of the importance of the nation state. Before the invasion, liberal imperialists liked to emphasise the limits of sovereignty, and to extol the virtues of imperial power acting to promote human rights and democracy, intervening in order to \"civilise the uncivilised\". They have gone a little quiet recently, for two reasons I would guess. Firstly, the US has behaved in the way that imperial powers always behave; it is an illusion to believe that it has ever seriously or systematically promoted democracy or human rights outside its own territory. And secondly, Iraq's resistance movement has reminded the world of the power of self-determination, of the resentment felt against rule by an overweening power from an alien culture and race. This was the lesson of the anti-colonial struggle, which somehow had been conveniently forgotten. National sovereignty and independent nation states matter, not just for countries such as Britain that have enjoyed this condition for centuries, but no less for those for which this is a historically novel experience. </p> <p>There is another sense, though, in which we are likely to see the resurgence of the nation state. The last century was dominated in its first half by medium-sized European nation states, and then subsequently by the rather larger US and Soviet Union. Of the world's presently five most populous countries - China, India, the US, Indonesia and Brazil (in descending order) - only the US has been a major global power during the course of the last half-century. This picture, however, is about to change; indeed, given the rise of China, it is already changing. </p> <p>Over the next half-century, the world is likely to assume a rather different shape. For the first time in the modern era, the world's two most populous countries (by a huge margin) will become major global players in their own right. It will mark the biggest watershed in global affairs since the birth of the modern nation state system. </p> <p>China and India, with well over a third of the world's population, will become major arbiters of all our futures. Compare that with the late 19th century, when Germany, France and Britain were the dominant powers, while accounting for only around 7% of the world's population (excluding their colonies, of course): or the US and the Soviet Union, which, by the end of the cold war, contained slightly over 10% of the world's population. The emergence of China and India as global powers will, in contrast to any previous period in modern history, introduce a rough and ready democracy to global affairs: the west, still the overwhelmingly dominant power in the world, represents only 17% of humanity, even on the most generous definition of the term. </p> <p>The arrival of China and India on the world scene will reinforce the importance of the nation state. They will dominate east Asia and south Asia respectively, which between them have well over half the world's population. Any trend in those regions towards the pooling of sovereignty along the lines of the EU, as in the case of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, will be secondary rather than predominant tendencies. The same can be said globally. India and China are, and will be, very different kinds of nation states from those that we are familiar with in the west. Not only are they far more populous - a novelty in its own right - they are also products of very different histories, cultures and races. </p> <p>Perhaps China provides the starkest illustration of the emergence of a new kind of nation state. Populous countries are often prone to fissure, the most recent example being the Soviet Union, while Indonesia is undoubtedly the least stable of the present top five. After Tiananmen Square in 1989, it was widely assumed in the west that the communist regime would fall, as it had in the Soviet Union, and that the country might even split. Neither happened. A crucial difference was that while the USSR was very multiracial, the Han account for the vast majority of Chinese. </p> <p>As Jared Diamond puts it in Guns, Germs and Steel: while five of the world's six most populous countries are creations of the past 200 years or so, China, is more than 2,000 years old. This is a nation state possessed of an extraordinary centripetal unity, its cohesion born of history and ethnicity. The fact that its population is almost twice that of North America and the EU combined provides an insight into its novelty as a nation state. </p> <p>None of this is to deny the importance of growing global integration, of which the EU is one example. Similarly, the accretion of a body of international law and the mushrooming of international institutions, such as the World Trade Organisation and the international criminal court (ICC), are intimations of a nascent sense of global community. But these tendencies have lulled many commentators into underestimating the continuing strength and importance of the nation state. </p> <p>The emergence of the US as a unilateral superpower was a rude reminder of where power is really located: indeed, it has sought to withdraw from, boycott or ignore the Kyoto treaty, the ICC and other bodies. The arrival of China as a superpower, and probably India a little further down the historical road, will only reinforce the underlying importance of the nation state. Nation states, not multilateral institutions, will be the decisive players of the 21st century. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Martin Jacques is a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics Asia Research Centre </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martinjacques1@aol.com\">martinjacques1@aol.com</a></p>",
  "He has accused the country of being part of the axis of evil, a harbourer of al-Qaida terrorists and a nuclear menace threatening global stability. <p>So President George Bush may view with suspicion a ringing election endorsement from one of America's current enemies. Iran has thrown its weight behind the Bush campaign, saying it is unimpressed with John Kerry. </p> <p>\"We haven't seen anything good from the Democrats,\" said Hasan Rowhani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, on state television. \"We do not desire to see Democrats take over ... We should not forget that most sanctions and economic pressures were imposed on Iran during the time of [former Democratic president Bill] Clinton. And we should not forget that during Bush's era - despite his hardline and baseless rhetoric against Iran - he didn't take, in practical terms, any dangerous action against Iran.\" </p> <p>Iran's declaration, however, is unlikely to be used on the stump by Mr Bush, despite the closeness of the race. </p> <p>\"It's not an endorsement we'll be accepting any time soon,\" said a Bush spokesman, Scott Stanzel, who suggested that Tehran should concentrate on pledging to \"stop its pursuit of nuclear weapons\". </p> <p>With the adage that \"with friends like these, who needs enemies\" probably springing to mind, Mr Kerry's spokeswoman, Allison Dobson, said: \"It is telling that this president has received the endorsement of a member of the 'axis of evil'.\" </p> <p>Washington severed diplomatic ties with Iran after militants stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. America supported Iraq in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and relations plummeted again when Mr Bush accused Iran of being part of an \"axis of evil\" with North Korea and pre-war Iraq. </p> <p>Since then, US forces have accused the Iranians of fomenting violence in Iraq. </p> <p>However, Mr Rowhani did not seem to think that Iran would be targeted next. \"At least Republicans have come to the conclusion in our region that militarism and invasion has not only failed to bring any results but, on the contrary, it is threatening their interests.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mr Bush gained another foreign endorsement yesterday when Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, said he \"hoped and believed\" the US president would win. But his prophecy may not be that reassuring. Mr Berlusconi confidently predicted victory for Spain's Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar in March, only for the incumbent to lose.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Saturday October 23</strong></p> <p><strong>Young Sherlock Holmes</strong> (Barry Levinson, 1985) <br>1pm, ITV1</p> <p>With Steven Spielberg as executive producer, there's a touch of young Indiana Jones about this exotic adventure. Chris Columbus's script has schoolboys Sherlock (Nicholas Rowe) and trusty Watson (Alan Cox) taking on a weird Egyptian cult that murders victims with hallucinatory drugs.</p> <p><strong>Green Card</strong> (Peter Weir, 1990) <br>3pm, Five</p> <p>Weir, director of Picnic At Hanging Rock and Witness, isn't the first name to spring to mind to direct a tinkly-light romantic comedy, but he does it with some style. Another surprise is that the great shambling Gerard Depardieu and anodyne Andie MacDowell make such a lively screen couple.</p> <p><strong>The Wind And The Lion</strong> (John Milius, 1975) <br>4.05pm, C4</p> <p>Loosely based on a turn-of-the-century diplomatic incident when upright President Teddy Roosevelt set about rescue and reprisal after a US woman and her two children were kidnapped by Moroccan bandits. Viewed simply as a desert adventure it's not far removed from Milius's Conan The Barbarian, but it's also a thoughtful study of clashing codes of honour, sophisticated westerner against noble \"savage\". Some serious acting, too: Brian Keith, Candice Bergen and Sean Connery (OK, he's not quite sho sherioush).</p> <p><strong>K-Pax</strong> (Iain Softley, 2001) <br>9.10pm, C4</p> <p>When Kevin Spacey's Prot arrives in Manhattan with that otherworldly smirk and eerie zen calm purporting to be a visitor from the planet K-Pax, Jeff Bridges' psychologist is perplexed: maybe Prot is just another deluded soul, but he has a curiously calming effect on the other patients, and seems to know an awful lot about space. A slightly schmaltzy mix of ET and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.</p> <p><strong>Unhook The Stars</strong> (Nick Cassavetes, 1996) <br>10.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>Cassavetes, son of the great John, has mum on his side in his impressive directing and writing debut. She is Gena Rowlands, who stars as Mildred, an elderly woman whose life takes an unexpected turn when she meets drunken Monica (Marisa Tomei) and her six-year-old son JJ (Jake Lloyd). Gerard Depardieu as a big ol' Canadian trucker is a slightly peculiar presence, but it's a sensitive and moving portrait.</p> <p><strong>Michael Collins</strong> (Neil Jordan, 1996) <br>1am, ITV1</p> <p>This stirring account of the Republican hero spans the period from the 1916 Easter uprising to his assassination in 1922, impressively melding emotional and political imperatives along the way. It's a vivid but balanced picture of a country in painful ferment, superbly photographed by Chris Menges, and full of excellent performances, including Liam Neeson as Collins, Alan Rickman as De Valera, Stephen Rea the dubious Ned Broy and Julia Roberts as Kitty Kiernan.</p> <p><strong>Scum</strong> (Alan Clarke, 1979) <br>1.30am, C4</p> <p>This grim picture of borstal life - which started out as a TV play until the BBC turned it down - packs a real punch. And kick, and head-butt. Roy Minton's story of a young offender brutally fighting his way to supremacy inside makes an angry case for reform, and there are uncompromising turns from Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels.</p> <p><strong>Sunday October 24</strong> </p> <p><strong>Red River</strong> (Howard Hawks, 1948) <br>2.15pm, ITV1</p> <p>One of the great westerns, an epic, oedipal tale acted out on the cattle trail. John Wayne's Dunson is an old westerner clinging to harsh, outmoded values; only a final, inevitable confrontation with his adopted son, Matt (Montgomery Clift) offers hope of redemption.</p> <p><strong>Star Trek: Insurrection</strong> (Jonathan Frakes, 1998) <br>7.10pm, Five</p> <p>After the dark pleasures of First Contact this ninth outing for the bold Trekkers seems a little tame. On a planet of eternal youth, Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard is forced to disobey Federation rules in order to save the peace-loving Ba'kus from ethnic cleansing by F Murray Abraham's oppressive So'na race. The thin plot barely makes warp-factor two, but it's an enjoyable voyage.</p> <p><strong>What's Love Got To Do With It?</strong> (Brian Gibson, 1993) <br>10.55pm, BBC1</p> <p>A gutsy biopic of Tina Turner, played with belting power by Angela Bassett. It's based on the soul singer's autobiography and she was on hand throughout the shooting, so it's very Tina-friendly. Having said that, there's much to admire in her rise to the top, weathering the storm that was her abusive husband Ike (Laurence Fishburne) along the way; and it pulls no punches with the domestic violence. Great songs too.</p> <p><strong>Predator</strong> (John McTiernan, 1987) <br>9pm, Five</p> <p>Gruesome but effective sci-fi adventure with Schwarzenegger leading a platoon of highly trained, highly unlikable fighters on a rescue mission in a South American jungle. But soon it is they who need rescuing, when they encounter an invisible alien who proceeds to slaughter them horribly, one by one, until the creature (Kevin Peter Hall) is goaded into showing itself and challenging Arnie to single combat: big mistake. The Predator, of course, is on the big screen now in Predator Vs Alien - hence this creative bit of scheduling ...</p> <p><strong>Alien 3</strong> (David Fincher, 1992) <br>11.10pm, Five</p> <p>Once more into those dark tunnels for Sigourney Weaver in this exceptionally gloomy chapter of the great SF horror saga. Her battle-weary Ripley crashlands on a planet colonised by convicts. Her surrogate family, and with them hope, are dead, but one creature is very much alive and stirring in her belly. Charles Dance as the resident doctor offers a little TLC until, her head shaven as if in preparation for execution, she rises to the final challenge. Attagirl, Ripley.</p> <p><strong>Monday October 25</strong></p> <p><strong>The Old Dark House</strong> (James Whale, 1932) <br>11.20pm, BBC2</p> <p>A classic comedy of horrors: the plot, from a JB Priestley novel and concerning a group of travellers obliged to spend the night with the menacing denizens of a creaky old mansion, has reappeared endlessly since. And Whale gathered a cast to die for: Boris Karloff, Charles Laughton and Raymond Massey.</p> <p><strong>The Lightship</strong> (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1985) <br>12.05am, BBC1</p> <p>Psychotic Robert Duvall and his ugly escapee henchmen hijack a lightship off the Norfolk, Virginia coast, but the captain is impassive Klaus Maria Brandauer and the baddies have run their flag up the wrong pole. Good, glowering performances and a suspenseful clash of good and evil.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 26</strong></p> <p><strong>Sleep, My Love</strong> (Douglas Sirk, 1948) <br>1.25pm, BBC2</p> <p>From the opening scene in which Claudette Colbert awakes on a New York-to-Boston train, not knowing how she got there, this is a tense and unsettling thriller that rarely loses the pace. The sad fact is, she's being drugged into mental breakdown by her no-good husband Don Ameche, so he can grab her money and run.</p> <p><strong>New York, New York</strong> (Martin Scorsese, 1977) <br>11pm, ITV1</p> <p>Scorsese goes on the town with a fine updating of MGM musical myths. So instead of debonair Gene Kelly you get Robert De Niro's charming, angsty saxophonist in harrowing love with singer Liza Minnelli. It looks and sounds great, with jazzy George Auld dubbing for De Niro; and it carries a real emotional charge.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday October 27</strong></p> <p><strong>The Way To The Stars</strong> (Anthony Asquith, 1945) <br>1.15pm, C4</p> <p>Second world war drama from the school of modest heroism, a detailed, low-key account of crew and groundstaff at an RAF bomber station in the midlands. The acute screenplay encompasses the ordinary and the tragic, and there are sterling, stiff-upper-lipped performances all round.</p> <p><strong>Die Another Day</strong> (Lee Tamahori, 2002) <br>9pm, ITV1</p> <p>Director Tamahori brings a muscly conviction to this 20th Bond adventure, even if the familiarly preposterous plot (involving North Koreans and Toby Stephens' abrasive megalomaniac, Gustav Graves) is much the same as the previous 19. Pierce Brosnan brings a steeliness to 007 unseen since the days of Connery, and Halle Berry as his tough and sexy sidekick Jinx deserves a movie of her own.</p> <p><strong>The Bodyguard</strong> (Mick Jackson, 1992) <br>9pm, Five</p> <p>Glossy, well-produced romantic thriller in which only the turgid theme song lingers - unwanted - in the mind. Kevin Costner plays a minder, ex-CIA, looking out for pop star Whitney Houston. The formulaic plot has the couple falling in love and hiding out in a rural retreat where he can lay down honest country values. Watchable, undemanding stuff.</p> <p><strong>Thursday October 28</strong></p> <p><strong>Carrington VC</strong> (Anthony Asquith, 1954) <br>1.15pm, C4</p> <p>The courtmartial of an army major on a trumped-up fraud charge. David Niven is his usual charming self as the unhappy Carrington, betrayed by neurotic wife, Margaret Leighton, and shifty superior Allan Cuthbertson, in an engrossing drama.</p> <p><strong>Six Days, Seven Nights</strong> (Ivan Reitman, 1998) <br>8pm, Five</p> <p>Harrison Ford stars in light comedy mode as a drunken pilot who crashlands on a remote South Pacific island with Manhattan magazine editor Anne Heche. So far, so contrived; and while their respective partners (Jacqueline Obradors, David Schwimmer) find solace together, Reitman has the marooned pair dunked in a sub-Romancing The Stone adventure. Despite the age gap, however, Ford and Heche make a winning couple.</p> <p><strong>8mm</strong> (Joel Schumacher, 1999) <br>10pm, C4</p> <p>A low-life wallow from Schumacher, with Nicolas Cage in world-weary private investigator mode, hired by a widow to find out whether the snuff movie found among her dead husband's possessions is the real thing. The trail through the gutter of LA's underworld is long and sludgy.</p> <p><strong>Friday October 29</strong></p> <p><strong>The Invisible Man</strong> (James Whale, 1933) <br>11.20am, BBC2</p> <p>Another intelligent, creepy horror story from the director of the classic Frankenstein. Claude Rains makes a singular debut - we don't glimpse his face until the very end - as the scientist whose self-experimentation makes him first invisible, then a mad murderer.</p> <p><strong>South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut</strong> (Trey Parker, 1999) <br>10.40pm, C4</p> <p>Fans of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's cheerfully offensive TV cartoon series will love this big-screen spin-off. The kids - Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman - sneak into a showing of the adult movie Asses Of Fire and come out with an extended vocabulary which they naturally pass on to their friends. Soon parents are united in moral outrage, and a war with Canada is on the cards. With a topical subplot involving Satan and Saddam Hussein, this is an outrageous, often hilarious satirical attack on censorship.</p> <p><strong>Crimes And Misdemeanours</strong> (Woody Allen, 1989) <br>2.35am, Five</p> <p>A film of two loosely-linked halves. Martin Landau plays an eye surgeon who coldly hires a hitman to deal with his troublesome mistress (Anjelica Huston); then Allen plays a TV producer who, for the love of Mia Farrow (those were the days) agrees to make a film about his insufferably successful brother-in-law and purveyor of sitcoms (Alan Alda, excruciatingly good). Intelligent and well acted, it seems finally over-ambitious.</p>",
  "When weblogs first sprang up, they tended to be whimsical \"online diaries\" or pages that recommended interesting sites to visit on the net. <p>Now bloggers have become weapons in the American presidential election battle. </p> <p>Since the campaign got under way their readership has grown enormously and the tone of their output has changed dramatically. </p> <p>Edward Morrissey, who runs the pro-Bush <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/\">Captain's Quarters</a> - by no means the largest - is now logging 840,000 visits a month (up from 30,000 in January) to his daily Democrat-bashing. </p> <p>Recent entries include the latest theft or defacement of a Bush campaign sign and the lyrics of a satirical song about John Kerry, Mekong Delta Blues, written by contacts in Minneapolis: \"When I was first elected / My daddy told me son, / You gotta raise their taxes / And take away their guns.\" </p> <p>Mr Morrissey argues that the lack of a British-style national press in the United States catering for readers across the political spectrum creates a natural audience for blogs. </p> <p>He said: \"American voters live primarily in cities and suburbs with easy access to only one print newspaper. They get only one point of view.\" </p> <p>Interest in an ideological rival, the pro-Kerry <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos </a>, has leapt from 40,000 visits a day to 800,000 in the past year. </p> <p>Markos Moulitsas, the man behind it, argues that blogs serve multiple roles in the election - as media watchdogs, centres for activism and fundraisers. </p> <p>He is one of several bloggers who banded together in an effort to persuade readers to lobby advertisers on TV stations affiliated to the Sinclair Broadcast Group about its plans to screen a documentary linking Mr Kerry's anti-Vietnam campaign to the torture of captured US soldiers. </p> <p>Rightwingers replied with a blog mobilisation of their own urging the advertisers to stand firm. </p> <p>Part of this development is due to the Howard Dean effect. The former Vermont governor's campaign for the Democratic nomination was propelled by activist bloggers, and he quickly realised that a large number of small internet donations could be as valuable as those raised by setpiece events. </p> <p>These days many bloggers spend much of their time dissecting and analysing quotations and news reports in support of a favoured candidate. The pro-Kerry <a href=\"http://www.electablog.com/\">Electablog</a> made a great deal of an admission by the TV evangelist Pat Robertson that George Bush had told him before the war there would be no US casualties in Iraq. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.blogsforbush.com/\">Blogs for Bush</a> was delighted when the retired general Tommy Franks appeared to refute Mr Kerry's claim that Osama bin Laden had been let off the hook at Tora Bora. The pro-Bush <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php\">Little Green Footballs</a>, meanwhile, has mocked Mr Kerry's running mate, John Edwards, as a \"silky pony\" for his shiny hair, and called Teresa Heinz Kerry a \"billionairehead\". </p> <p>Not all are so partisan. Andrew Sullivan's <a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/\">Daily Dish</a>, which is logging an average of 3m visits a month, is yet to endorse a candidate. </p> <p>He enjoys the freedom, saying: \"I don't think a leftwing mag would have tolerated my pro-war enthusiasm a year ago, and a rightwing mag wouldn't tolerate my disillusionment today.\"</p>",
  "<p>Traders did not know which bid situation, or phoney bid situation in some cases, to watch yesterday - what with talk that <strong> HBOS</strong> was bidding for <strong>Prudential</strong>, approaches being made for Kidde and <strong>Eckoh Technologies</strong>, another player appearing in the Manchester United saga and stake-building by Icelandair in <strong>easyJet.</strong> </p> <p>In the grand tradition of Friday bid rumours there was also talk that an approach had been made for white goods retailer <strong>Kesa Electricals</strong>, up 2.25p at 272p, and online travel agent <strong> ebookers</strong>, which shot up 19.25p at 217p. </p> <p>While HBOS, down 6p at 728p, put the kibosh on the Prudential story - Pru ended up 5.75p at 392p - easyJet's Icelandic raider was flushed out into the open. At the end of the day, Icelandair admitted it had picked up an 8.4% stake in easyJet, up 21p at 152p. </p> <p>Elsewhere among the second liners, speech recognition software specialist Eckoh Technologies - what remains of former dotcom darling 365 Corporation - rocketed 23% to 11p after the company said it had received a bid approach. </p> <p><strong>Carphone Warehouse</strong>, up 6p at 160p, is thought to have run its slide rule over the business in recent weeks but no bid is believed to be imminent. </p> <p>As well as its voice recognition business, which does everything from automated cinema listings to train timetables, Eckoh recently bought telecommunications service provider Intelliplus. The business would fit well with Carphone's Opal Telecom, which lies behind its successful Talktalk home phone service. </p> <p>Away from all the talks and rumours, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended down two points at 4615.4 points as the oil price continued to rise, reaching a new high in New York as London trading drew to a close. </p> <p>After the close of play on the stock market, Brent crude set a new record high of $51.55 a barrel. While that was good news for <strong>BP</strong> - up 3p at 542p - and <strong>Shell</strong>, up 1.75p at 419.25p, traders were fretting about the impact of rising prices on corporate earnings and the global economy dragging the wider market down. </p> <p>Some stocks bucked the trend. <strong>Intercontinental Hotels</strong> added 12.5p to 676p after Morgan Stanley raised its target to 710p, while investor approval of its buyback plans saw <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> gain 5.5p to 357p. </p> <p>Away from the main index the <strong>FTSE 250</strong> added 22.5 points to 6,287.2 points with the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> at 2595, up 4.7 points. </p> <p><strong>Roxboro Group</strong> continued its recent good run, adding 9p to 357.5p - a new year high - on talk that trading continues to be very strong at its So lartron electronic measurement unit. </p> <p>Down on AIM, <strong>Civica</strong> rose 9.5p to 224p as the software and services group, which specialises in working with public sector clients, announced its latest suite of products. Broker Altium Securities, which has the stock as a buy, said the Authority range of products is aimed at helping local authorities optimise council tax collection and deal with fraud. \"In an area which remains highly competitive, the Authority product suite should help enhance Civica's already strong market position among local authorities,\" the broker said. </p> <p><strong>Neteller</strong> gained a further 12p to 311.5p following Thursday's news that the online money transfer company has been awarded an e-banking licence by the Financial Services Authority, which opens up the rest of the European Union to the company. </p> <p>Joint broker Durlacher said that means Neteller will be able to make use of BACS transfers, credit card and debit card transactions - which will make it easier for customers to use the worldwide money transfer service. </p> <p>Shares in <strong>Just Car Clinics</strong> leapt 3.75p to 23p after it settled a legal spat with Dixon Motor Holdings, while <strong>Ultimate Leisure</strong> rose 8.5p to 363.5p following positive comments by chairman Allan Rankin at the bar operator's annual meeting. </p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Prestbury Holdings</strong> lurched 9p higher to 27p as the financial advisory firm hoisted the for sale sign as part of a strategic review of the business. Just over a month ago chief executive Lee Birkett bought 23,314 shares in the company at 12.75p each. At present he has just over 8m or 46.2% of the business. </p> <p>Something of a renaissance has been going on at themutual.net, one of the great dotcom survivors. Since the start of the month, shares in the AIM-listed online reward company have doubled in value. </p> <p>The company operates a website that members use as a portal to access about 500 online shopping sites. Every time they buy from one of these sites, members are given rewards redeemable for cash or shares in the themutual.net. The profitable business makes money from commission paid by the retailers and from selling member's email addresses to direct marketers. </p> <p>Admittedly, the share price is still so small you need a magnifying glass to see it, but on Monday themutual.net will carry out its share consolidation. It has also changed the way it rewards its customers, so many members will take cash instead of shares, ending the dilutive effect of successful trading. These moves have apparently aroused interest in the stock among some institutional investors, and the stock closed yesterday at 0.315p, compared with 0.15p at the start of September. </p> <p>Finally, Monday will also see the debut of <strong>ADDLeisure</strong>, an investment vehicle designed to capitalise on new opportunities in the health, leisure and fitness sectors, following a successful placing by Seymour Pierce at 5p a share. </p> <p><strong>BT</strong> continued its recent weak spell yesterday, easing 0.5p to 183p as rumours circulated around the market that it has hit a snag with one of the key NHS contracts won by its global services arm. </p> <p>Industry whispers over the past few days were that BT had been forced to ask LogicaCMG, its partner in the \u00a3530m, seven-year contract to build a national communications backbone for the NHS, to double the number of its staff working on the \"spine\". LogicaCMG shares ended up 2p at 178.75p yesterday. </p> <p>Industry moles said BT was experiencing problems hitting milestones connected with the contract. </p> <p>With BT's retail business showing few signs of significant growth and its wholesale arm held back by regulation, the global services unit is one of the few bright spots in the BT universe. </p> <p>But a spokesman for BT's global services business last night denied anything had gone wrong, saying: \"The thing is still just going ahead as normal.\" </p> <p>BT shares were also knocked by a downbeat note from Lehmans ahead of quarterly figures in November. The broker reiterated its underweight stance, saying that, while its wholesale business will show continued strong growth in broadband connections, its retail market share will remain \"disappointingly low\".</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1332853,00.html\">Read part two of How I did it</a></p> <p>Philip Green is a man whose reputation precedes him like a particularly clamorous one-man band, heavy on the cymbals and trombone slides. It's as though he burst out of a side street three years ago, marched himself along the main drag colonising the marketplace, then stopped, turned round and strutted back trailing gaudy evidence of his conspicuous spoils. First, he took over Bhs, then the entire Arcadia Group, which owns the rag-trade high street middle ground - Topshop, Topman, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, to name the most prominent - doubling profits on a gentle upward annual trajectory while all about him are dropping off. Meanwhile, we stand on the sidelines wearing his garments, our British puritanical sensibilities outraged, giving him a slow handclap. Boo, we say, who is this vulgarian from the wrong side of the tracks? How did he come to win the real-life Monopoly game while our backs were turned? </p> <p>We don't like this sort of thing. We think there is something faintly obscene about a man who is so full of himself he spends \u00a35m on his own birthday party, particularly if he calls it a \"toga\" party, holds it in Cyprus and welcomes such as Michael Winner to it. Imagine! All done up in sheets like Roman emperors. Who do they think they are? And his wife bought him a solid gold Monopoly set, featuring his very own acquisitions. How bling-bling can you get? And a \u00a37m yacht to swan about in. Can't be right. How rewarded we were when he came a cropper with his bid for Marks &amp; Spencer back in the summer and the big-store establishment told him what he could do with his \u00a39bn bid. He'd have swept the board. Had us over a barrel. There were tantalising tales of fisticuffs among the retail hierarchy and a particularly delicious episode where Green is alleged to have not only landed one on his arch-rival Stuart Rose, but to have subsequently handed him his mobile phone so that his wife could give him a piece of her mind into the bargain. He's a spiv, bawled the media. A former barrow boy, a mock gangster, a rough diamond, a bully boy. He's not like proper City businessmen. I can attest to this last. He isn't. </p> <p>For one thing, he doesn't keep you waiting. None of that usual plutocratic, my-time-is-priceless-your-time-is-worthless exhibitionism applies in Arcadia headquarters. You get about two minutes to register how palatial are the premises, how pretty are the young women, how scrupulously buttoned up inside their suits are the young men and how peacefully reverential are their references to Him and He: then the show is on the road. </p> <p>\"Let's give it a whirl,\" said Philip Green, taking off his jacket, folding back gleaming white cuffs to reveal a watch with which you could circumnavigate the world. You don't get to be a multibillionaire Bonaparte of the retail establishment and control more of London's prime real estate than the Duke of Westminster by sitting dutifully answering questions. And he doesn't. He goes to it at a mile a minute. In short, sharp, staccato bites, he does it his way. Tells you. His way. How he did it. His way. If a modest interjection amuses him, he'll take it up before tossing it aside. Otherwise, he goes silent for a count of about four seconds, then continues as though nothing happened. At one point he rudely interrupted himself. \" Gemma! \" he bawled. \"Can you bring me a cup of tea, darling\" - then, as an afterthought, \"D'you want anything? No? Right, cheap round.\" He doesn't have to do this, he wants you to know. Just last week he turned the entire Channel 4 news team out of this very office. Jon Snow came on all aggressive, pointed his finger at him. He's not having that. Why should he? Still, he's a man of his word. </p> <p>He rattled through the early stuff. Born 1952. Croydon (in case his accent doesn't give him away). Went to boarding school in Berkshire, aged eight. Nothing wrong with that; gives a boy independence and, no, he wouldn't send his own kids away to school. Because he wants them at home, that's why. Left at 15. Parents in business. Garages, electrical shops, property. His heart wasn't in it till he got to the bit about half a crown. When he was 12, his father died. His mum carried on the businesses. \"She's a go-getter,\" he said. \"Still is. Ring her up and she's on the other line to her solicitor, telling him do this, do that. She's still got the properties she had 45 years ago. Still does all her own books at 85 years of age.\" Anyway, back then, she let him help out in the shops and garages. She opened a self-service petrol station and he'd work in the forecourt on weekends and school holidays. Wipe windscreens, change oil, that sort of thing. The punters would tip him, sixpence, two bob, half a crown. \"Half a crown,\" he said with a nostalgic smile. \"Remember them? Nice heavy coin, that.\" Saturdays he could knock up as much as five pounds. Pocket money? What's pocket money? Having money given to you? No way. He earned what he got. At school there were two sorts of boys: those who wanted to stay on and those who wanted to get away. Simple as. He was the second kind. Things have changed, we're in different times now, light years away. Education's high up on the agenda, you know? Everybody pushing to get their kids in university. Living standards have changed, values have changed, the value of money has changed. \"You look round and say to yourself, whoooosh, the last 10 years just flashed by. And you remember what half a crown used to mean.\" </p> <p>Philip Green got his wish and went out to work when he was 16. \"Obviously,\" he said, \"I was never going to be a scholar.\" He laid an emphasis on the \"obviously\" that is both pre-emptive and pragmatic. It tells you he finds nothing wrong with book-learning, but it was not for him, and if you imagine that makes him a dunce, you've got another think coming. While others chose to sit in classrooms being told what to think and how to pass exams, he was out in the real world with the grown-ups, observing how many beans make five. For five formative years he learned the ropes of shoe retailing, importing and so forth, starting with filing and warehouse work and trotting samples to salesmen, until what he didn't know about shoes wasn't worth knowing. </p> <p>\"They were what you might call old money shoes. One-ninety nine, two-ninety nine, mostly imported from China and Taiwan. We were one of the first to do business in the far east. Eventually, after about four years, I was allowed to sell. Talk about how things have changed! In those days, they used to set up in hotels. This was in the Mount Royal Hotel, above the Cumberland. All the importers and buyers would check in for the annual shoe exhibitions. I was standing there and this guy came in and picked up one of our shoes. Well, it was a clog, really, like a Scholl with a bit of a heel and a leather strip over the top. Liked it. How much is it? I said one ninety-nine. What's the price of 40,000 pairs? I said I'd look into it, belted over to the boss. Which is he? I pointed him out. No, he said, he's got long hair, he can't be serious. I knew the guy came from a big group so I said, right, I'm going to get that order. He bet me five pounds that I couldn't and gave me a deadline. So off I went. They wanted them wrapped in a special way, special box, special this, special that, what didn't they want. I said yes, yes, I'd see to all that, and the weeks went by and the deadline was coming up, so I'm chasing, chasing, dadadada, and I get the order, on the nail. I ran all the way up the five flights, up to the top of our building, slapped it down, said there's your order. And he got this old-fashioned leather wallet out of his back pocket, and every note was like it had been ironed. Got the note out, feeling it to make sure it was just the one and handed me the five quid. That was my first order. Anyway, eight weeks later there had been so much aggravation about what they wanted and didn't want, the whole thing got cancelled. So he called me and said, when you're passing, call in and give me my fiver back. Still, he trained me up ...\" </p> <p>By the time Green was 23, he reckoned he was ready to strike out on his own. He took himself to Hong Kong and got the lie of the land. The principle, he reasoned, was the same - he would just deal in jeans instead of shoes. \"That's how I started,\" he said, somewhat portentously. \"Importing jeans.\" </p> <p>It was risky, but I thought it was time to speak up for the wet liberals of this world. \"Sweat shops,\" I ventured. \"Exploiting the poor,\" and waited to be thrown out on to Oxford Street. </p> <p>He paused a couple of seconds. \"Have you ever been to Hong Kong?\" he said. \"No, I didn't think so. It's very fast moving, Hong Kong. Very fast. Very quick. Nobody goes to sleep. They work 17 hours a day and nobody's tired. Hong Kong. Very built up. You wouldn't imagine it. Every inch built up, cram full of people. All working. What's your definition of exploitation? Would you go out and pay twice as much for something you could get three doors away at half the price? What Hong Kong and Taiwan were then, the whole of China is today, and China is the fastest growing country in the world. They've got the endeavour. That's why. Is that exploitation, using the workforce of a billion people who want to make produce for the rest of the world? Now we have Vietnam and eastern Europe. I've just helped one of my suppliers build a factory in Vietnam. So what are we doing, are we providing the expertise in these places to help people work or are we exploiting them? It's a marketplace,\" he said, emphatically, as though I had thought it was a holiday camp, \"and I'm concerned to buy the best products I can in the marketplace we're in. We're not looking to exploit, but we are looking to be quick on our feet.\" He looked about himself for inspiration to clinch his argument, picked up a small bottle of mineral water (in Arcadia, everyone seems to be sip-sip-sipping mineral water all day long) and declared, \"If someone offered me 50,000 bottles of this at the right price, I'd buy them. I'd buy anything. Old stocks, discontinued lines, cancelled orders. At the right price. Now let's get on or we'll be here all day.\" </p> <p>Which brings us to 1979, 25 years ago this very month. Green heard tell of 10 designer gear outlets going out of business. The stock was up for grabs. Thirty-five grand's worth at retail. In like Flynn. \"I'll give you Xp in the pound,\" he said. \"Deliver it to my warehouse.\" Then he went to have a look at it. \"It didn't look all that bad to me,\" he said, \"so I sent it all to the dry cleaners, got it put on nice satin hangers and polythened it up so it looked brand new. Then I thought, why sell it on for a few quid more? Sammy Stewart was retiring, I heard, so I bought his place off him. 41 Conduit Street. Did rather well ...\" </p> <p>Now it's 1981. He bought the place in Bond Street. \"I buy companies like this,\" he said. And spares no detail. \"I went to see this guy, Friday afternoon. Said I understand you want to sell your shop. He said, er, well, yes. I said what you want for it? He said 75 grand. I said Monday morning. Boom-boom - 75 for his lease, 75 for his stock, sight unseen. Go round Monday afternoon, exchange contracts. Then the phone rings. Guy says he understands my shop's for sale. I say he's made a mistake. Then some other guy phones up. I said not interested. Keeps ringing. Right? Seven and a half grand deposit at this point. I say, 'You want to give me 250 grand for it tomorrow afternoon, you can buy it. Take your client round to my lawyer.' So he did, he bought it. But, I said, you can't have it for six weeks. Done. Boom-boom. </p> <p>\"Next morning we're up and running. I only opened the shop in the evenings. Five till eight. By appointment. When people think ... hmmm? They come along. I got my money back within a week. Sold the lot. So I phoned this bloke I bought it off - nice man - and said, have you got any more stock? And he said come to Milan. So I chartered a plane. Leather goods. Some of these designers, they've got stock for years. Warehouses big as old aeroplane hangars, full of it. I said how many pieces are there. He said 20,000. I bought the lot. Must have shipped four, five trailers. We filled this shop, floor to ceiling, put up these great big posters and had them queueing all down Bond Street. Wasn't popular with the rest of the street, but what could they do?\" </p> <p>But this was small beer. The preface to a major hurricane. The tension is building for the big one. Philip Green extracts another long, thin fag from the packet marked Fumer Tue and prepares to enjoy himself. How he made his first million. </p> <p>\"Guy comes to see me, Thursday morning. He's got an import business. Jeans. Gone broke, receivers in, dadadada. He's owed a million quid. Got about 400,000 pairs of jeans. Wants 935 grand. I called my bank, said it's got to be done tomorrow night. Next day they say OK. I say good, we've got to get to Bristol, pick you up at four. Chartered a helicopter. Off we go, banker, lawyer and me. Spend all night negotiating to buy this company. Five in the morning, one point one million, all done. Not allowed to start the helicopter up after that. Too noisy that time of the morning. Middle of nowhere, pitch black, police car comes by, gives us a lift to the train station, quick kip on a bench, caught the milk train back to London. </p> <p>\"Monday morning we're up and running. We'd bought various people who owed money, so we go and see one of them. In Devon, it was. Said we'd like to collect our 250,000 quid. We had a little debate and he signed 10 postdated cheques. As we're leaving, he said, just en passant, he wished he could sell his business in three days flat. I didn't even know what he did. Found out, called him up next morning. Said was that a joke? Went to see him in Slough. Big building. He had 65 shops, concessions at Debenhams. He wanted four million quid. Have a look at his books. Didn't seem to add up right. Got my accountant to do a bit of a recce. Turned out he owed the bank three and a half million and his suppliers three and a half million. He's bankrupt. They're losing 70,000 a week. Can't pay the staff. Call him up on the Tuesday, say there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is I'll buy it. The bad news is you're broke. Said I'd take an option for 65,000 followed by another 435 if I get round the bend in six months. He said we're done,\" and Green is barely pausing for breath. </p> <p>\"I went to see the bank, said the business is broke but I think I can fix it. I'll give you 100,000 as a gesture of goodwill towards your three and a half million if you freeze the debt for six months. Done. Then I had a look at the business. I could see what had happened. The usual. Same issues you see today. Bad buying, no discipline, no control, old stock, indecision, time-wasting, corporate thinking. I flew to Paris, shopped the shops, three suitcases of merchandise, went to Hong Kong, got it all copied, flew in, restocked the shops, got all the creditors reflowed, and got the business back to breaking even in four months. </p> <p>\"Out of the sky the phone rings. These people want to buy me up. I said no, I just bought it. Don't want to sell. They went on. And on. I said all right, come and see me. Said look, I want 10 million for it. They said how d'you make that out? I said, well, basically I don't want to sell, so if you pay me what it's not worth I'll sell it. Now I've got a deadline with the bank for February 26 1985 and I end up selling the business on the 25th. For seven million. Went down to the bank in Curzon Street, said what do I owe you? They said dunno, er, 3 million 430 thousand pounds, I said right, there's your cheque. Slapped it down. Done.\" He cracked his palms together, his eyes bright with remembered relish. \"So,\" he said. \"Can be done is my motto!\" </p> <p>He wanted my tape off then, which was just as well, since I had become somewhat slack-jawed listening to all this. He set out a few ground rules. No, he will not pick over old sores. He will not bad-mouth the competition, the press, the City or remark upon the lamentable plight of high-street behemoths not in his control. Nothing in it for him. You've got to enjoy life, he said. He lives in Monte Carlo. Full time. He commutes to work. He has transport - a nice business jet that seats 12. A Gulf Stream, if I must know. He takes 10 weeks off a year and it's not a bad formula, that. He relaxes with the wife and kids. Swimming, cycling, tennis, ping-pong, sailing, whatever. Yes, they've got a yacht. They're keen boaters. And ping-pong's a favourite. He plays to win, none of that nonsense about letting the kiddies win. As with everything he does, he does his best and he likes to come off best. Winning's better than losing. Happy's better than sad. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1332853,00.html\">Read part two here ...</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Additional research: <strong>Helen Oldfield</strong></p>",
  "Is Gordon Brown's luck finally starting to run out? His management of the economy - combining sustained economic growth with prudent finance - has won plaudits even from political opponents. Under his stewardship the economy has recorded its longest period of growth in living memory, with no quarterly falls in national output, let alone recessions of the kind the previous Conservative administrations clocked up twice in 10 years. Mr Brown has undoubtedly had more than his share of good fortune. He was lucky that the Tories left him rapidly improving public finances - thanks to a succession of tax increases of the kind the Tories now oppose. He was lucky to be operating during a period of low global inflation. He was lucky also that an unexpected buoyancy in consumer spending and house prices sustained the economy through difficult periods. <p>However, two related things have now happened to give Mr Brown considerable pause for thought. This week it was revealed that the budget deficit in the six months to September had not shown any reduction, in contrast to the chancellor's March forecast that the deficit would halve this year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that if this trend continued, the chancellor would break his self-imposed \"golden rule\" for the current budget - everything except capital spending - to be in surplus over the economic cycle. Mr Brown predicted a cumulative surplus of 0.7% in the current cycle. The IFS says that on present trends there will be a deficit of 0.3%, even if this year's overshoot does not persist. </p> <p>The second factor was yesterday's GDP figures, showing that the economy had expanded by only 0.4% in the third quarter - half the rate of the previous six months. This was mainly attributable to a sharp 1.1% drop in industrial production - traditionally an activity that Labour has championed - diluted by a 0.8% rise in output from the still booming service sector. Slower growth is one of the main reasons for the deterioration in the government's finances since it generates lower tax revenue. It is important to stress that there is no crisis at the moment. Even after the slowdown, the economy is still growing at 3%, compared with 3.6% earlier, though if the present slackening continues in the final quarter, it will be a different story. The problem for Mr Brown is that if he cannot balance the books when the economy is expanding as steadily as it has done until now, what are his options if it decelerates further in response to higher interest rates and slackening world trade? </p> <p>Even then the UK economy - which will still be benefiting from sharp rises in public spending and the fortuitous tax revenues from higher oil prices - will look healthier than other major European economies, both in terms of budget deficit and economic growth. But that is not the political or economic point. Mr Brown himself laid down the criteria by which he asked to be judged - a budget surplus on current spending over the economic cycle. Success is therefore politically important to him as an individual and to Labour as a whole, since it has wrested the mantle of prudence and economic competence from a Tory party which has traditionally claimed it almost by divine right. </p> <p>A crisis is not unavoidable. It is always possible to debate when an economic cycle starts and ends; and GDP figures are often revised - usually upwards - when more data is gathered. But that does not alter the fact that, whereas before this week Mr Brown would have needed bad luck not to meet his targets, he now needs good luck to meet them. One consequence of the prime minister's decision to carry on until the end of a third term is that Mr Brown will have to live with the consequences of his own actions. He may still succeed - but the task is now much more daunting than before.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will today defy City critics and militant trade unionists when he warns them that the world economy - including rising oil prices - is too fragile to permit him to relax his economic discipline. </p> <p>The chancellor will signal his intention to tough it out despite being threatened with a civil service strike by 300,000 workers on November 5 and City predictions that he will break his own \"golden rule\" for government borrowing. </p> <p>His words are much sterner than those of Alan Milburn, the cabinet's elections coordinator, who promised that Labour \"optimism will challenge the pessimism\" being promoted by the Conservatives. </p> <p>In a speech to thinktanks at the Compass conference in London today, Mr Brown will invoke a series of tough choices made since 1997, starting with the tight spending round and the operational independence given to the Bank of England. </p> <p>\"Faced with a profound set of global economic changes unparalleled in our economic history, oil prices now over $50 [\u00a327] a barrel having doubled since April 2003, and a slowdown in quarterly growth rates this year in the US, Japan, France and Italy, I will continue to take the necessary action to entrench stability and promote the conditions for growth,\" Mr Brown will say. </p> <p>In a passage which some observers claimed is a dig at Tony Blair's hopes of taking sterling into the eurozone, he will add: \"We will do nothing that puts at risk the short term or long term stability of the British economy. So there will be no relaxation of our discipline.\" </p> <p>This week some analysts predicted Mr Brown would soon be forced to break his rule that borrowing over the economic cycle should be for investment only, and not for goods, services and benefits, which are now rising faster than predicted. </p> <p>Mr Brown will dig in today against both those attacks and the public sector dispute. \"We will meet our fiscal rules in this cycle and next, and there will be no return to inflationary wage demands,\" he will say, stressing the long-term challenges to economic efficiency.</p>",
  "<p>Lady Young takes her environmental responsibilities pretty personally. She buys organic food, her garden in Bedfordshire has a composter as \"big as the moon\" and she travelled 55,000 miles last year by train to avoid more polluting air travel. </p> <p>But even the straight-talking chief executive of the Environment Agency is forced to compromise occasionally. To satisfy her own weakness for ornithology, the former head of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds flew on holiday to Papua New Guinea. \"You can't see birds of paradise in Cornwall,\" she explains. </p> <p>Young has few other such weaknesses, one suspects. The hard-driven Scot has cleaned up the Environment Agency's own nest and hugely increased its external profile. The \"non-departmental public body\" - with its 11,500 staff and an annual budget of \u00a3850m - will be back in the spotlight on Tuesday as it opens its third annual conference in Birmingham. </p> <p>Young has already guaranteed a lively level of debate by biting a lump out of some of the UK's bluest-chip companies, such as British Energy, Rolls-Royce and Thames Water. </p> <p>The agency comprehensively named and shamed them for their environmental shortcomings in a controversial summer report. In return, employers' body the CBI claimed that \"poor design and heavy-handed enforcement\" of environmental regulations was costing British business \u00a34bn a year. </p> <p>Immaculately decked out in autumnal colours - all nutty-brown suit and flashes of gold jewellery - the cross-bench peer defends her actions at the agency's Millbank offices high above the Thames. </p> <p><strong> No deterrent</strong><br> </p> <p>\"We call it fame, name and shame. We celebrate where the sectors are improving overall and within each sector we have got the companies that are doing very well - we name them - and those that are doing badly, we name them as well.\" </p> <p>The chemicals sector is picked out for praise but she is happy to run through the stragglers again: \"The agricultural sector - there is still some way to go. We are disappointed by the water sector. They are doing lots of good stuff - cleaning up water, that's what they are about - but there are still too many pollution incidents, and the construction sector - we really have work to do there.\" </p> <p>As for the \u00a34bn figure, she argues that the CBI should be triumphant because it shows that Britain has the cheapest price for environmental law implementation across Europe. </p> <p>\"It was not a great [CBI] report. They got their figures round their neck on several points, which I think they would admit now,\" the chief executive explains. </p> <p>But it is far from all-out war between the two sides. The CBI privately admits to grudging respect for Young, while she believes the world of commerce is more content than it lets on. \"I have this thing called my gripe-ometer, my gripe-ogram, which basically lists all the things that businesses say they are unhappy about, and we have done some analysis to see what the causes of that are. </p> <p>\"Some of it will be about the way we do our work, but much of it is about the way in which environmental regulation comes from Europe and is implemented in the UK.\" </p> <p>Young also has the respect of green groups but some still feel that business is being let off too lightly. Companies might be named or shamed but what, they ask, is a fine of \u00a310,000 to Rolls-Royce? </p> <p>\"No deterrent whatsoever,\" Young agrees. \"We are doing a bit of work as part of the Hampton review [on the enforcement of regulations] and also generally to see if we can persuade people that there should be a more flexible range of fines, not just related to criminal offences. </p> <p>\"At the moment the only thing you can do in terms of a company is fine it - it is the only remedy. What we would like to see is some administrative and civil penalties applied much more quickly. </p> <p>\"The problem with the Spotlight [naming and shaming] report is that it's often a couple of years between the time of the offence, the investigation, the prosecution and the report; by which time managers have moved on, companies might have been bought and sold, and it does not feel like a swift process - that if you get it wrong you take your medicine.\" </p> <p>Young has been looking at alternative solutions following visits to the United States. She is particularly interested in the way companies over there have to make up for lapses through environmental remedy and improvement. </p> <p>This helps to rebuild the reputation of companies as well as \"heal\" problems caused to local communities, she believes. </p> <p>But there have been complaints from the environmental lobby in Britain that the agency has not got the resources to enforce its own rules. Does she agree? </p> <p>\"Clearly no public body has got all the money it would like,\" says Young, but she accepts that government funding will continue to be squeezed and is looking at other ways to raise cash. </p> <p><strong> Business mythology</strong><br> </p> <p>A tax on landfill sites currently goes back to companies to help them comply with regulations but Young would like some of that money to go back to her agency. </p> <p>Another way of dealing with money shortage is to make her own organisation more efficient. She is already proud of saving \u00a3118m under a three-year productivity drive and has another three-year programme that is almost as large. </p> <p>Despite her stints as BBC vice-chairwoman and a non-executive on the board of Anglian Water, some businessmen feel she might not have the hard commercial experience to really improve the agency or understand companies properly. She, naturally, demurs. </p> <p>\"Charities are in the not-for-profit sector but my god they have to make their money. We doubled the size of the RSPB and tripled the income. You have got to understand what profit looks like. </p> <p>\"And of course I did 20 years of cost-reduction in the National Health Service. There is a kind of mythology that unless you are from business you can't understand what business wants. </p> <p>\"I don't think that's the case. About 25% of our staff come from a business background.\" </p> <p><strong> Renewables v nuclear</strong><br> </p> <p>The agency might need more cash as it pushes into important new areas. These include public health issues in poorer communities, such as \"diffuse\" pollution in air, soil and water. </p> <p>Working closely with local authorities could come soon, as well as tackling controversial areas such as aviation, road and rail, plus more obvious ones connected with global warming, such as flooding. </p> <p>Young has already visited Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast, where the local river blasted a huge hole in its banks, triggering dire warnings that the east coast town would soon be under water. </p> <p>\"John Gummer [the local MP] is over-egging it,\" she argues, but accepts that the problems raised are serious. \"The options for Aldeburgh are being discussed and I don't honestly believe we won't be protecting Aldeburgh. </p> <p>\"There is no way it would be just let go. But there will be other bits, which are primarily rural and agricultural, where there is not going to be the cost benefit to make it a sensible proposition. </p> <p>\"On top of that, I don't think anyone wants the whole of the east coast to be behind a bloody great wall.\" </p> <p>There are chunks of the east coast that are going to have to be defended, says Young, who does not want to see Suffolk's coastal nuclear power station, Sizewell, \"go bang in a big way\". </p> <p>The agency has more than a passing interest in atomic power: it is the regulator of nuclear waste. </p> <p>But Young has watched with horror as the nuclear lobby has begun to flex its muscles amid fears of a future energy shortage. \"If everyone has the idea in the back of their mind that nuclear is going to come back in the frame, there will never be enough welly behind renewables. </p> <p>\"The market is going to be tremendously difficult to promote and prompt. If there is the slightest hint it might get the rug pulled out from under it, it will just never happen.\" </p> <p>With fears growing about a looming energy crunch, the atomic power lobby is on the warpath, pushing its case for modernisation and expansion. But it will clearly find itself with a certain battling baroness to contend with. </p> <p>\"In the 10 to 15 years when it will be a bit thought-provoking to be as reliant on imported gas as we'll be, then I think losing our nerve and plumping for the nuclear option is not a sensible proposition.\"</p>",
  "<p>The muddiest estuary in Britain officially becomes one of the country's biggest nature reserves today after years of campaigns against the effluent from shoreline factories and passing ships. </p> <p>The Humber's hundreds of thousands of migrating birds will be protected by strict measures, as will the 80 species of fish and the colony of seals which has taken over an RAF bombing range. </p> <p>English Nature's decision follows three years of consultations on the estuary, whose linked ports of Hull, Immingham, Grimsby and Goole have overtaken the Thames complex as the country's busiest. </p> <p>The shipping companies and the port authorities have accepted the plan, along with the water companies and local authorities.The reserve unites seven sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) in the estuary, creating a huge protected area from the resort of Cleethorpes to the upper reaches above the Humber bridge. </p> <p>One development project likely to be scuppered as a result is the \u00a32m proposal to illuminate the delicate suspension bridge with high-powered lights and laser beams as a \"welcoming icon\" to Hull, Yorkshire and the wider north. It is the only one of the world's 10 longest suspension bridges not to be illuminated. </p> <p>The Humber SSSI will also protect a wide range of less visible creatures, from small mud-dwelling animals to the colonies of bitterns - an estimated 10% of the species' British population - whose boom can be heard from breeding grounds in claypits on the estuary shore. </p> <p>Kate Jennings, English Nature's project manager for the Humber, said: \"The whole estuary is one big system, with all of its habitats and the species these support being inextricably linked. Decaying matter from intertidal reedbeds feeds millions of animals living in the extensive mud and sand flats. </p> <p>\"They in turn provide a ready food supply for the fish and, as the tide turns, a feast for over-wintering and migrating birds, including knot, dark-bellied brent geese and golden plover. </p> <p>\"It's amazing that these long-distance travellers journey thousands of miles from their Arctic breeding grounds to seek out the Humber's plentiful food source and to roost in its neighbouring grasslands and wetlands.\" </p> <p>Peter Barham, environment manager of Associated British Ports, said: \"Naturally, we had some concerns going into these negotiations, but we've welcomed closer working with English Nature. We feel the measures confirmed today will not only enable us to meet our business needs but also to be a good neighbour to the estuary's special wildlife.\" </p> <p>The bridge lighting project hopes to run a \u00a334,000 trial, funded by Hull city council and the port's marketing company Hull CityImage, to show that it does not affect the wildlife. But a spokesman for the Lincolnshire Trust for Nature Conservation, part of an alliance which has stymied years of previous attempts, said: \"The whole scheme is just a kite that they're trying to fly again.\" </p> <p>The 37,000 hectares (92,460 acres) of the Humber estuary are one of the most fascinating tidal reaches in Europe, with a third of the area falling between high and low tide marks, and hosting two ecosystems as a result. </p> <p>The deepwater channel that allows supertankers into Immingham docks changes weekly, involving vast shifts of mud and sand, and the river's pilots are renowned for their expertise. Similar movements are eating away Spurn Point, the ribbon of land which protects the estuary from the North Sea. </p> <p>The eroded material is swept into the Humber, where it adds to the foreshore of Sunk Island, now an exceptionally rich piece of farmland.</p>",
  "<p>The self-proclaimed sceptical environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg has been visible on London's seminar circuit this week promoting his argument that spending money on climate change is wasteful and that the world would be much better off spending it on halting Aids and providing water and sanitation instead. </p> <p>Despite his consistent attacks on enviromentalists for exaggerating the planet's problems, Lomborg is actually no more a sceptic than he is an environmentalist. The latter claim rests solely on his having contributed to Greenpeace in his youth. The former claim is belied by his deep faith in a wholly benign future for the planet. This gives him the same kind of sunny and often appealing optimism that we see in President Bush. </p> <p>By one of those amazing coincidences that can suddenly snap things into focus, Lomborg was putting his case this week in the building next door to the one in which an unprecedented coalition of environment and development bodies was spelling out, in some detail, exactly how climate change is already intensifying poverty. </p> <p>He is in London in advance of the publication of a new book on the conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus. Sponsored by the Economist, Lomborg invited eight Nobel prize winning economists to meet in Copenhagen. Their task was to decide how best to spend a (notional) additional $50bn dollars in order to advance global welfare, particularly in developing countries. </p> <p>No one can fault Lomborg's ambition. Getting two economists to agree about something is difficult enough. Getting eight to agree about everything must have been daunting. </p> <p>To help them on their way the laureates were offered a top 10 list of global challenges, such as disease, hunger, water, migration and climate change, and invited to use cost-benefit analysis to rank them in terms of value for money. To no one's surprise, they came to the same conclusion as Lomborg on the value of climate change. </p> <p>The reality is that applying cost-benefit analysis to questions such as these is junk economics. Junk economics done by Nobel laureates is simply distinguished junk economics. Applying the logic of the Copenhagen Consensus to the Iraq war illustrates this nicely. </p> <p>We, the world that is, have spent at least $200bn in the past year on this war, four times the amount the laureates were asked to allocate. It is not easy to imagine Bush and Blair asking for a cost-benefit analysis on the removal of Saddam to ensure this really was the best way to advance global welfare, but just suppose they had done so. </p> <p>A legion of economists would have devilled away at a vast array of fascinating questions. What was the cost of the life of one American soldier? How did that compare to the cost of an Iraqi soldier? Were Iraqi civilian casualties to be counted as a cost or a benefit? What is the avoided cost, therefore a benefit, of preventing the launch of one nuclear weapon by Saddam? Should you discount the benefit of preventing subsequent launches to allow for the diminished value of whatever target had first been attacked? </p> <p>If this sounds like the 21st century equivalent of counting angels on the heads of pins, that is because it is. There is no useful information to be discovered in such an exercise. Whatever else Bush and Blair were wrong about, they were right not to ask for a cost-benefit analysis before going to war. </p> <p>Cost-benefit analysis is a perfectly sensible tool for helping us make narrow choices - between two different routes for a railway line, for example. Even then, it is fraught with practical difficulties in quantifying all the variables that must be considered. It is no use at all in helping us make wide choices, between going to war and, say, having a healthier population. </p> <p>Cost-benefit analysis can help you choose different routes to a goal you have agreed, but it cannot help you choose goals. For that we have politics. People disagree about priorities and they do so on a huge variety of legitimate grounds. When they do so, they are not arguing about value for money, but about the kind of world they want to live in. </p> <p>It is a vanity of economists to believe that all choices can be boiled down to calculations of monetary value. In the real world, outcomes are not so easily managed. A stable climate is something we might now call a system condition for civilisation. That is, it is something without which civilisation is impossible - though it is not, of course, itself a guarantee that there will be civilisation. </p> <p>The messy world we live in is one in which an unstable climate will guarantee poverty for untold millions. But it is equally one in which, if we fail to solve the problem of poverty much more quickly and cleverly than we are doing at present, we will continue to destabilise the climate. The Lomborg argument that we can delay one until we have solved the other is a cruelly false prospect. </p> <p> The truth is that the Copenhagen Consensus is not economics at all. It is politics masquerading as economics. The sources for much of Lomborg's anti-environmentalism can be found on rightwing websites, predominantly American. </p> <p>The faith-based politics of the new right consistently claims the authority of science or economics whilst ignoring any evidence that does not conform to its pre-judgments. Hence the determined corruption of science by the Bush administration. This has led to a call from over 5,000 scientists, including 62 Nobel laureates, to restore scientific integrity to public policy. </p> <p>What we are seeing here is the emergence of a new axis of politics. As the 21st century progresses we will increasingly find ourselves debating whether authority or evidence should be the basis for political choice. For the new right the authority of faith is much to be preferred. </p> <p>Lomborg is entitled to his political opinions, and he is entitled to promote them as vigorously and imaginatively as he can. I disagree with his analysis but I do not doubt his sincerity. The dishonour belongs to those for whom he is a useful pawn. </p> <p>We would not be debating his views at all were it not for the Economist magazine. Until it chose to give a Danish lecturer in politics of no academic distinction whatsoever the rare accolade of a named essay, the world had remained in peaceful ignorance of Lomborg's opinions. Without the Economist, there is little likelihood that eight Nobel laureates would have participated in as intellectually corrupt a process as the Copenhagen Consensus. </p> <p>The Economist's masthead carries a proud promise by its founder to promote \"a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy and timid ignorance obstructing our progress\". For much of its life it has lived up to that promise. But its heavy promotion of Lomborg's faith-based approach to the future suggests that its current editors have changed sides. They should be ashamed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tom Burke is a former director of Friends of the Earth and special adviser to Michael Heseltine, Michael Howard and John Gummer when they were environment secretaries; he is co-founder of Third Generation Environmentalism and advises the extractive industries </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tom.burke2@btinternet.com\">tom.burke2@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The great thing about the NiteMates Lighted slippers wasn't so much that they had hi-tech, contoured lenses for maximum illumination - although those obviously represented a remarkable technological advance over previous slippers. No, it was that they were upholstered in a plush terry-cloth material for your comfort.</p> <p>\"I've still got a pair in a box somewhere,\" says Nick Biggs, the copywriter who supplied the Innovations catalogue with its masterly product blurbs. \"They're very well-made. Really comfy.\" Plus they help you see in front of your feet in the dark, a boon in the admittedly unlikely event that you can't find a light switch or torch. \"That's right,\" says Biggs. Has he ever used them? \"Only once. I lost my torch and I needed to go into the loft, so I held one of them in my hand. Very useful. Never really used them as they were intended, though.\"</p> <p>Biggs's hi-tech, open-toed slippers appear on the cover of a new book entitled The Very Best Of The Innovations Catalogue, a homage to those heady days when glow-in-the-dark golf balls and LavaBuns (the eight-hour heated cushion, only \u00a337.50, great for hitherto numb-bummed fishermen) were must-haves for many delightfully misguided Britons.</p> <p>In fact, there were two types of full-beam slippers: the open-toed, backless ones favoured by Biggs, and the car-shaped ones made of plush red Dacron (80%) and cotton (20%), with nonslip PVC soles, favoured by small boys. Of the latter, the catalogue entry points out: \"When you step into them, those powerful headlights are automatically switched on, safely lighting your way in the dark.\" Sweet.</p> <p>That was one of the extraordinary, if utterly decadent, things the Innovations catalogue did in its pomp: it created irrepressible desires for things that you didn't hitherto know that you needed; desires that would be stilled only when you had shelled out the wherewithal for them. Just before the goods arrived, it is true, you might have realised the error of your purchase, but it would be, in a very real sense, too late.</p> <p>The car-shaped slippers were a snip at \u00a319.95. Only one problem: there was no facility to dip your slipper headlights when you passed other slipper drivers on the landing. Did no one think of the consequences? For a start there would be nasty shag pile-ups (with the attendant risks of carpet burn) and potentially blinding nocturnal dazzle. Horrible when you think about it.</p> <p>In today's more judgmental age, Trinny and Susannah might well counsel that you shouldn't wear fullbeam open-toed slippers at all (still less with argyle socks underneath), but who cares? The heyday of the Innovations catalogue, which was roughly from 1990 to 2003 (when the magazine was briefly withdrawn, only to resurface as a website under new management, at the end of last year), was a time when some of us bought things that married extraordinary comfort to equally amazing ingenuity, and to hell with the opprobrium of fashionistas. Happier times, really.</p> <p>That's why people bought things such as the Trouser Robe (\u00a339.99), whose jumpsuit styling meant that it didn't gape open lewdly or let in draughts like those rubbish bathrobes you might steal from hotels. \"Much more respectable when guests arrive unexpectedly!\" pronounced the catalogue wisely. The machine-washable, super-thick cotton towelling robes came with a roll-up collar that could double as a hood to dry hair, which you have to admit is quite brilliant.</p> <p>But nothing, so far as I can judge, could explain the purchase of the so-called Glamour Suspender Stockings (three-pair pack, \u00a39.95). The catalogue described them thus: \"Fashionable, hygienic and sensual - the new stockings with built-in suspenders that you put on and take off like tights.\" Sensual? Hygienic?</p> <p>That was the thing about the Innovations catalogue: the input of brainpower into product design was in inverse proportion to the justifiableness of said product, at a time when you might think big-brained inventors should - just a thought - be curing cancer, creating commercially viable alternatives to fossil fuel, and so on. Instead, they were being used to devise such things as the Ribetting Frog Phone (\u00a344.99). This was a plastic frog who sat on a plastic rock waiting for your call. \"And when it comes he informs you with a hilarious electronic 'Ribet! Ribet!'\" That's right, \"hilarious\". Got a problem with that?</p> <p>Biggs, 49, spent 13 years making these products come to life in his captions. He made it seem essential that you buy a phone that allowed you to reply with one of a range of 16 voices (man, woman, Alex Ferguson - only joking about the last one). He was the man who convinced us that if you had a sagging chin, you could work it off in the Chin Gym (\u00a339.95). He was the man who made us order the Securi-Gnome for \u00a379.95, because he convinced us that when the 18in high plastic monstrosity (with its cunningly disguised PIR body heat censor, whatever that is) was on duty in your front garden, you could sleep easily.</p> <p>Did this work drive him just a little bit bonkers? \"Not really,\" replies Biggs evenly. \"I'm emphatically a gadget nut, you see. I was quite proud to be working on the catalogue, because the gadgets were really cool.\" Even the electronic pillbox that came with its own supply of water? \"Yes, even that.\" And the levitating pen? \"Right.\"</p> <p>Clearly Biggs had fun writing the captions. One has the following headline: \"Any pen can write. This one talks, too ...\" How could you not read on? \"Why do the most brilliant ideas always seem to occur when you're away from your desk? The Pencorder is the world's first writing instrument with a built-in digital recorder. Using advanced customised semi-conductor chips, it holds up to 40 seconds of speech - and plays it back with telephone clarity via a miniature loudspeaker.\" A steal at \u00a399.95.</p> <p>But sometimes Biggs went too far. \"Sleeve Holders are back!\" he wrote in one giddy moment, and carried on in the same vein. \"Sleeve Holders have come right back into fashion - and they're still the most practical way to keep your sleeves up! These attractive gold and silver coloured metal Sleeve Holders look great with any shirt, blouse, or jacket, and are especially useful with today's baggy sweaters.\" Barmy. Mind you, only \u00a37.95 for two pairs.</p> <p>And yet, at his best, Biggs prodded our secret anxieties with cunningly manipulative prose. \"Ever had the sneaking suspicion that your breath isn't quite as fresh as you'd want?\" he wrote. \"Then this little device is a discreet way to check. Simply breathe on to the tiny glass censor, and after five seconds the BreathAlert gives a guide in four grades (from None to Strong) so you can take action if necessary. Small enough for pocket or purse.\" Only \u00a319.99 (batteries supplied). You want one, don't you?</p> <p>But arguably the best product that ever appeared in the Innovations catalogue was the one Biggs wrote up as \"The bin that's almost too good for rubbish!\" He went on: \"\u00a389.99 for a waste bin? Sounds a lot, but then this is far from an ordinary bin. For a start, it's made entirely from solid mahogany.\" It measured 13in x 11in x 8in, which is big, certainly big enough for all the stuff I'm getting rid of - frog phone, chin gym, several pairs of \"glamour stockings\". But not, of course, the one-touch electric pepper grinder (\u00a319.99) with a built in light that illuminates your plate so you don't dispense too much.

  "<p>Your carpets, plastic shopping bags, gas cookers, photocopiers, even the tissue you blow your nose on are pouring into the air a cocktail of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). According to research by the US Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air can be up to 10 times more polluted than outdoor air, and our increasingly sedentary life means we spend up to 90% of our time indoors. But before you spend the rest of the afternoon looking into expensive air filters, go buy some houseplants.</p> <p>Bill Wolverton, a former Nasa scientist and author of Eco-friendly Houseplants, has spent the past 30 years researching the link between houseplants and a healthy indoor environment. In the 1960s, when manned moon bases were planned, Nasa scientists were set the task of creating closed life-support facilities (sky labs) for outer space. The problem with sky labs was that they quickly built up hazardous levels of air pollution. What they needed to do was create a little bit of home. The earth produces and sustains clean air through the living process of plants. So they bought some houseplants and got to work.</p> <p>Most air-purifying houseplants are tropical plants that have evolved unusually high photosynthetic rates, allowing them to survive under the dimly lit canopy of the forest (an environment similar to our homes and offices). Nature has enabled them to create microbes on and around their roots that are vital for soil fertility and plant growth. These microbes can quickly degrade organic waste materials and detoxify many environmental poisons that reach the soil - up to 60% of the breakdown of VOCs happens in the root area. </p> <p>So how do all those chemicals travel from the air down into the soil? Two methods: a plant's leaves absorb chemicals and move them to the root area. Here, the microbes get to work and convert them into food. A percentage of the chemicals are also absorbed and destroyed by the plant's own biological process, without involving microbes.</p> <p>The second method is through transpiration. This is when water vapour is lost into the atmosphere from the leaves. As water rapidly moves from the roots up to the foliage, air is pulled down to the soil around the roots. This is how air-polluting substances are drawn to the microbes around the roots. The best purifying plants also tend to have high transpiration rates. Wolverton and Nasa's research shows that it is this ability to move polluted indoor air to the roots that makes these plants such good air purifiers.</p> <p>The common peace lily, for instance, effectively removes VOCs such as acetone, methyl alcohol, benzene, ammonia, formaldehyde, toluene and xylene from the air surrounding it. These chemicals are emitted from varnishes, corrective fluids, adhesives, floor coverings, synthetic furnishings, wood stains and computer screens.</p> <p>But how many do you need to make a difference? Wolverton recommends at least two to three plants per 100 sq ft. Plants should ideally be situated within your personal breathing zone, so put them next to the computer or bed.</p> <p><strong>Morning sun</strong></p> <p>Rooms with either morning or afternoon sun are the best place for houseplants, though most won't tolerate long periods of direct sunlight. Dypsis lutescens (areca palm) is one of the most common palms available. Originally from Madagascar, its graceful fronds make it an attractive houseplant. And with an exceptionally high transpiration rate (a large palm will transpire one litre of water every 24 hours), it is among the best houseplants for removing indoor nasties. It's very easy to care for, with few pest and disease problems, but it does need to be watered at least once a week.</p> <p>The lady palm, Rhapis excelsa, has one of the best rates for removing ammonia and is close behind the areca palm for overall removal of pollutants. It usually remains pest-free. Give it plenty of water in the spring and summer months, easing off slightly in the winter. If the fronds turn dry and brown, it's because you have forgotten to water it.</p> <p>The bamboo palm, Chamaedorea seifrizii, is very easy to look after, and has one of the highest transpiration rates, since it pumps moisture back into the indoor atmosphere. It has a consistently high rating for the removal of benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde. It has clusters of small, slender canes with arching fronds that reach to 1.8m. In summer, it needs plenty of water, and must be kept moist in winter. Wash the leaves periodically to prevent spider mites. If palms really aren't your thing, the Dendrobium orchid is a good alternative. Orchids tend to be harder to grow, however, and over-watering is a common pitfall. </p> <p>A general rule of thumb is to water generously in spring and summer, and very sparingly in winter. The plus side is its long-lasting flowers. Dendrobium species and hybrids are moderately effective at removing alcohols, acetone, formaldehyde and chloroform from the atmosphere. A good choice for beside the bed is the Christmas cactus, hybrid Schlumbergera, since it has the unusual habit of removing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen at night - the opposite of most plants. Make sure it's on a chair or table, level with your breathing zone.</p> <p><strong>Sunny and humid rooms</strong></p> <p>For rooms with long periods of direct sunlight, try the South African gerbera daisy, Gerbera jamesonii, and hybrids - its long-lasting flowers will bloom throughout winter. In early Nasa trials, it proved to be extremely effective at removing chemical vapours in the air. The one thing it doesn't like is to be over-watered.</p> <p>Even a pot of something as everyday as tulips will remove formaldehyde, xylene and ammonia from the air. For something a little more exotic, there is the dwarf banana, Musa acuminata 'Dwarf Cavendish'. It requires a humid environment, making it a good choice for a sunny bathroom, and has a very high transpiration rate, so needs plenty of water and regular feeding throughout the summer.</p> <p>The Boston fern, Nephrolepis exaltata, scores the highest for removing air pollutants, especially formaldehyde. It thrives in humid environments, so unless you keep it in the bathroom, it will need misting once a day.</p> <p><strong>Gloomy rooms and offices</strong></p> <p>For rooms that don't get much direct light, such as large office spaces, you need plants that thrive under a dense tropical canopy. The golden pothos, Epipremnum aureum, has heart-shaped leaves with splashes of gold or cream. It has a good rate of chemical removal and is a wise choice for newcomers to houseplants, as it is very hard to kill.</p> <p>The genus Dracaena is common in the houseplant world. It will tolerate dimly-lit areas and fairly cool temperatures. Dracaena glauca 'Janet Craig' is a popular variety, and is one of the best at removing chemical toxins. If well looked after, it will live for decades.</p> <p>For houseplant beginners, serial plant abusers or those who go on holiday a lot, the following are hardy to the point of being nigh-on unkillable: spider plants, parlour palms, Easter cactus, snake plants (or Sansevieria) and rubber plants. That said, for indoor plants to act as efficient living air purifiers, they do need to be healthy. All houseplants benefit from regular fertilising, repotting and a reliable watering regime. In return they'll let you breathe fresh air.

  "<p>Getting into a fix is looking a lot more tempting after some banks and building societies this week cut the cost of their new fixed rate mortgages. Others look likely to follow suit in the coming weeks. </p> <p>The reason for this is growing speculation that interest rates may have peaked. Many economists think more rate rises are unlikely. </p> <p>At the start of August, 4.99% was about the cheapest you could get a two-year fixed rate mortgage for. Now you can get one for 4.69% -courtesy of Northern Rock - and home loan brokers believe quite soon they will probably go even lower still. </p> <p>But not everyone is repricing their fixed deals downwards. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is one of those that has just upped its rates sharply and others have yet to reduce the cost of their deals. Mortgage brokers suspect the explanation for this is that we are in the middle of a period of major upheaval for the mortgage industry. </p> <p>Next Sunday is \"Mortgage Day\" - the day City watchdog the Financial Services Authority becomes responsible for policing Britain's multi-billion pound home loans industry - and some lenders are probably trying to limit inflows of new business while they get ready for this big change. </p> <p>The advice this week was that if you are looking to remortgage, it may be worth waiting a few weeks until the dust settles, when many lenders are expected to come out fighting with some very good deals. </p> <p>And even though fixes are looking quite good, if you're a borrower who is not on a particularly tight budget, you may be better-off going for a discounted rate or base rate tracker loan. These tend to be a bit cheaper than the best fixed deals. </p> <p>The Northern Rock 4.69% two-year fixed rate loan is available up to 75% of the property's value. It has some flexible features and early redemption penalties only within the fixed period - but there is a hefty \u00a3695 arrangement fee. </p> <p>Top of the Moneyfacts (moneyfacts.co.uk) best buys this week is a Britannia building society two-year fix at 4.79%, available up to 85% loan-to-value and with a slightly smaller arrangement fee (\u00a3449). </p> <p>Meanwhile, Scarborough building society is offering a two-year fix at 4.85% where the minimum deposit is only 5% and the arrangement fee \u00a3375. </p> <p>Simon Jones, at mortgage broker Savills Private Finance (spf.co.uk), reckons that perhaps as soon as next month we will see lenders offering two-year fixed rates priced at below 4.5%. \"And hopefully we will see five-year rates at 4.99% before too long, especially when lenders have got through the pain of Mortgage Day,\" he adds. </p> <p>The reason banks and building societies have been repricing their fixed deals is that money market \"swap rates,\" which govern the amount charged for these loans, have been falling. </p> <p>Jonathan Cornell, at fellow broker Hamptons Mortgages (hamptons.co.uk), points out that C&amp;G has nevertheless increased its two, three, five and seven-year fixed rates to 5.49%. </p> <p>\"I think we are now in a strange period where even if swaps continue their downward trend, lenders are not likely to follow suit until the dust has settled from Mortgage Day - which is not so good for borrowers as they are unlikely to have the same level of choice as they would normally,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I suspect most lenders will pile into the market in January, so expect some hot rates then as they compete to start 2005 with a bang.\" </p> <p>Hamptons' \"rate of the week\" is Alliance &amp; Leicester's two-year discounted rate deal, with a current pay rate of 4.44% (2.4% off its standard variable rate). It's available online and by phone, offers an overpayment facility and has no overhanging redemption penalties, though there is a fee of \u00a3395 to pay. The maximum loan is \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Mr Jones says that if you're remortgaging and looking for a fix, \"there is potentially some merit in waiting for three or four weeks\". </p> <p>If you're purchasing now and want the security of fixed monthly payments, you should take what's on offer and be comforted by the fact that rates are generally lower now than a few months ago. </p> <p><strong>Green haven in East Sussex</strong></p> <p>Millions of us recycle our rubbish and eat organic food, but what about going the whole hog and living in a \"green\" home? </p> <p>GreenerLiving Homes is a brand new ethical property development company specialising in building and selling houses that are environmentally sustainable but which require little or no change in the way we live our lives. </p> <p>The \"first of many\" of its green homes has been built in Crowborough, East Sussex.

  "<p>Where have all the leaders gone? Awol is the answer, according to a study this week which shows that most of us despair of meeting a manager who also qualifies as a leader. </p> <p>The study by the Chartered Management Institute argues that a lack of inspiration stifles UK businesses. It says workers and line managers are calling out for corporate leaders who inspire their staff. But a survey by the institute shows that fewer than four employees in 10 claim to see any evidence of inspiring leadership at work. </p> <p>The report, Inspired Leadership, An Insight Into People Who Inspire Exceptional Performance, identifies the three main characteristics that employees long to see. Genuine shared vision from executives mattered to 79% of the workers polled, with 77% saying that they would like to see their leaders showing confidence and trust in staff teams. Some 73% of the respondents were seeking respect from line managers and customers. </p> <p>The single most important factor that a majority of employees would like to see in their leader is \"inspiration\". However, only one in 10 respondents felt that they witnessed this elusive quality at work. </p> <p>Six out of 10 employees in the study, which was commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), reported that their managing director or chief executive was out of touch with how staff feel. Only 40% said the head of their organisation chatted to employees and fewer than one-fifth (19%) experienced an open-door policy. </p> <p>Nigel Crouch, a consultant working in the DTI's innovation unit, says: \"In the incredibly fast-changing world in which we all operate today, the really successful organisations are those that innovate most effectively. And the key to effective innovation is genuinely involving as many of your people as possible in how you take the business forward together, which requires truly inspirational leadership from the top team down.\" </p> <p>Among the corporate leaders identified by the DTI is Mark Constantine, chief executive and co-founder of Lush, the natural cosmetics business. The hand-made beauty products chain opened its first shop in Poole, Dorset, in 1994, with a second one in London soon after. Today Lush has more than 100 outlets and mail order operations in Canada, Australia, Italy and Japan. </p> <p>Mr Constantine says: \"At Lush everyone is allowed to have ideas, not just the senior management team. I ask everyone on the shop floor to tell us how to do things better, and respect what they have to say. Then I provide the resources to ensure that the solutions are delivered. </p> <p>\"My idea is to give our people the freedom and support to get on with their job. For example, store managers control their own budgets and all staff have the freedom to test new ideas and ways of working. This may sound like a load of soft soap but I believe that the challenge for today's business leaders is to provide a working environment where people can realise their full potential.\" </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong>Achieving Best Practice Inspirational Leadership Guide is available free from the DTI if you call <strong>0870-150-2500</strong> quoting ref URN 04/1085.

  "<p>Interest rate rises have dampened rampant house price inflation across the property market, except for one small corner - luxury homes costing \u00a31m or more. </p> <p>A resurgence of City bonuses and an influx of Russian buyers pushed the number of \u00a31m-plus house sales up by 61% in the first half of 2004 compared with 2003. Nearly 2,000 homes went for more than \u00a31m, according to figures from the Halifax, based on Land Registry data. </p> <p>The \"stucco belt\" of Kensington and Chelsea made up the lion's share of \u00a31m property sales. Outside the capital, Trafford, Greater Manchester, and St Albans, Hertfordshire, saw the highest number of luxury home sales. Many areas of the country recorded their first \u00a31m property sale, including Barnsley, Teesdale and Dover. </p> <p>The market for houses selling for more than \u00a32m also grew rapidly, but remains almost exclusively in London. All but 14 of the 257 sales of houses for \u00a32m or more were in London and the south-east. </p> <p>The figures cover sales until June 30, since when fears of a property downturn have increased. But upmarket estate agent Knight Frank said the market for properties above \u00a32m-\u00a33m remains buoyant, although at the \u00a31m mark there are signs of weakness. </p> <p>Liam Bailey, Knight Frank's head of residential research, said: \"It's no surprise there's been a big increase in \u00a31m-plus sales. Unlike the mainstream market, which boomed in 2003, the top end was badly affected by events such as Iraq and international terrorism. A large proportion of buyers at this end are international and are very affected by global events. </p> <p>\"These people have come back into the market, and in the \u00a32m-\u00a35m bracket we are seeing phenomenal strength. Russians make up less than 1% of all house sales in London but 16% of houses sold for above \u00a35m this year have gone to Russians. </p> <p>\"They make aspirational purchases, they don't have mortgages and are not exactly impacted by small interest rate rises.\" </p> <p>But just below the \u00a31m level the market is sagging, according to separate data from Hamptons Mortgages. The brokerage, which specialises in arranging loans for people with middle to upper level incomes, said yesterday that average property values had fallen from \u00a3510,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to \u00a3430,000 in the third quarter, and that purchase \"chains\" were becoming longer. </p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Abbey National UK Growth was probably the most hated fund in Britain. Variously described as a \"dog fund\", a \"sinking supertanker\" and \"even worse than an endowment policy\", it languished at rock-bottom in the performance tables. </p> <p>But are there now signs of a turnaround? In recent months, the \u00a31.25bn fund - used by many Abbey National mortgage holders as a vehicle for paying off their home loans - has started to show some better figures. While encouraging, it is probably a case of one cheer rather than two - and certainly not three. </p> <p>The fund, launched in 1995, invests in a broad mix of big UK shares and was sold by Abbey as an alternative to endowments, enabling borrowers to build up a tidy nest-egg with which they could repay their mortgages. </p> <p>But by dripping money into the fund, mortgage holders were flushing their cash down the drain. At first, it wasn't too bad - in the first four years it managed average performance, and at one point grew to \u00a32bn in size. Then in 1999, it began a catastrophic decline. By October last year it was ranked 331st out of 332 funds in the UK equity sector. </p> <p>What went wrong? A slavish adherence to growth stocks such as telecoms, technology and media companies was largely to blame. Abbey hung on in when others baled out after the end of the dotcom boom, while a switch into more defensive stocks came too late. </p> <p>In October last year, Abbey finally pulled the plug on the fund manager running the trust. They parcelled the \u00a31.2bn that was left into three portions, giving State Street Global Advisors 50%, JP Morgan Fleming 25% and Barclays Global Advisors 25%. </p> <p>How have they got on? Well, over the year the fund is up 12.5%, a shade below the average for UK growth funds of 13%. But over six months it is up 3.5% compared with the average of 2.8%, and over three months is ahead 2.6% compared with the market's 1.5%. </p> <p>Abbey's John Kelly says: \"It's not one big event; rather a number of factors. The combination has worked well - when one has slowed, the other has come through.\" </p> <p>But financial advisers who specialise in investment funds are unimpressed. Phil Clements, investment director of Towry Law, says: \"This is classic marketing department stuff. The recent rebound in the market has been concentrated in a few shares at the top end of the index, where the Abbey National fund has always been focused. </p> <p>\"For example, it has always held a lot of BP, which has done well because of the rise in oil prices. It would have been extraordinary if this fund hadn't done well over the past few months.\" </p> <p>He says since the FT All Share came off its lows in March 2003, the Abbey fund is only up 29.5%, compared with 40% for the market as a whole and 70% for Invesco's UK Growth fund. He says growth investors would do better switching to funds such as HSBC Growth &amp; Income, and Lazard UK Alpha, while long-term investors might switch to Invesco Perpetual Income or Framlington Equity Income.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sounds like a job for Arthur Daley!</strong></p> <p>No, it doesn't flog dodgy motors to unsuspecting punters - it rents out classy cars. Enterprise is the largest transatlantic car rental company and the fastest growing car hire business in the UK. It banks nearly \u00a34.4bn from our occasional need for a set of wheels. Across the globe, the firm provides a living for more than 57,000 people in over 6,000 locations.</p> <p><strong>Sorry mate, never heard of it - been around long?</strong></p> <p>If only you got out more, you would see that Enterprise Rent-A-Car has an outlet within 10 miles of 85% of the UK population. It was founded by Jack Taylor in St Louis, Missouri, in 1957, and still remains a private family-run company. It washed up on our shores in 1994 when it opened its first branch. Today the firm is one of the top three rental car companies in the UK with more than 2,500 staff and 245 branches - and still growing.</p> <p><strong>What does it want from me?</strong></p> <p>The company mainly hires graduates, from all disciplines, who display a genuine interest in running their own business. You must have the motivation and energy to excel within a busy sales and customer driven environment. You will need the necessary front to forge a career in a management and sales environment.</p> <p><strong>What will I get in return?</strong></p> <p>You will join as a management trainee and be assigned to your nearest available branch. Then, as part of a structured two-year training programme, informally known as the \"Enterprise MBA\", you will start to pick up valuable skills in every aspect of business management from sales and marketing to team development, customer service and accounting. It's a steep learning curve but there is ample support from a network of senior managers and a dedicated mentor. Enterprise trainees can reasonably expect to be promoted to assistant manager within a year when they begin to share in their branch's profits. Typically assistant managers become branch managers within the next 12 to 14 months, when they effectively run their own company.</p> <p><strong>Give us a glimpse of its selection procedures</strong></p> <p>The initial recruitment stage kicks off at an assessment day where you will take part in a series of team-based activities and are assessed on your business acumen, team interaction and leadership skills. Following these tests you will face an individual interview. There is an opportunity to work in a branch for a day to get a feel for the culture and an insight into the type of work.</p> <p><strong>Any useful inside information?</strong></p> <p>Don't turn your nose up if you get asked to wash cars when you start the management training programme. Unlike the hierarchical structure of many UK companies, Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a product of a more egalitarian American business culture. Even the current chairman and CEO started out at the same entry level management training programme, by washing cars.</p> <p><strong>Where do I send my CV?</strong></p> <p>Apply online at <a href=\"http://www.enterprise.com/careers/uk\">www.enterprise.com/careers/uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Nick says:</strong> \"If you make it past its hiring squad, you will be joining one of the '100 Best Companies To Work For' named by Fortune Magazine.

  "<p>Big business dominates modern life. Corporate culture has outsized the church, the monarchy, even government, and we in the UK seem to love our chainstore monoculture more than most. Naomi Klein, Noam Chomsky and Michael Moore detail the marauding antics of global monoliths, but few people are prepared to give up the good life simply on principle. Watching The Corporation one feels simultaneously angry, desperate and powerless beyond a good moan down the gastro pub with the wife. What are you going to do, give up corporate products altogether?</p> <p>That's the kamikaze brief for this week: cease consuming anything supplied by a corporation for seven days and try to remain ethically/physically sound. It's true, multinationals aren't all resource-sucking, society-trampling villains, and woolly puritans who boycott Incs, Plcs and Ltds indiscriminately are surely just as clueless as the retail zombies padding round Bluewater. But for the purposes of this research project, I must for one week abstain from consuming any goods or services produced by \"big business\". So it's veggie shoes, fairtrade hummus and stuff made by people in barns from now on.</p> <p><strong>Day 1</strong></p> <p>The first day begins well, mentally preparing for the task ahead; I grew out of Big Macs and Disney years ago so how difficult can this be? On goes the telly. ITV, Sky, MTV etc etc. Off goes the telly, on goes the radio. Is the BBC in or out? Public service or not, it's still a corporation. I decide to play safe and go pirate, so John \"miseryguts\" Humphrys makes way for MC Bruiser, the morning host of Rinse FM's blistering grime show. I've considered myself to be \"off message\" ever since skimming No Logo, so with a bit of forward planning and willpower, this week will fly by. I purchase Ethical Consumer (reusable nappies and sustainable sewing machines tested) at the designer eco store Fresh &amp; Wild, along with a week's organic non-branded groceries. Health food shops have moved on since the days of frozen nut cutlets: minimal decor, world music on the PA, and a bill that's comparable pound for pound with Fortnum &amp; Mason. I usually buy this kind of stuff at Sainsbury's, and feel smug as those around me shove ready meals into their baskets. Here, everyone's macrobiotically sound, and suddenly I don't feel so special.</p> <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p> <p>Shouts going out to Trace in Dalston from Bruiser. I enquire about sustainable energy in the home and bar outgoing calls from the mobile (Orange/Nokia) for a week. Trudging down Oxford Street, I resist multiple urges to shop in chain stores, and early panic turns to a swelling sense of pride. Me, the lone retail warrior against an army of drones with their unending shopping lists and their credit card debt ... pitiful. It becomes clear there is literally nothing I can purchase here, and shopping as a leisure activity is completely off the agenda. Shame, HMV has its Biggest Ever Sale on (Trading Places DVD only \u00a34.99). Back at home, the evening's entertainment is provided by independent music (Finnish techno) and film (BFI) only. Can you consume culture the way you do food, by origin and means of production? Maybe, but most of it's plinky-plonky bollocks that looks better on the shelf than in the player. Early to bed.</p> <p><strong>Day 3</strong></p> <p>Life's pace has ground to a halt. No buses (Leyland/ Stagecoach/ OPEC), no car (Citroen, OPEC again) or the Tube (PPP). Walking to and fro was liberating at first, fancying myself as a fl\u00e2neur, strolling the streets in wonderment. But now I'm just knackered and late for everything. Also, I've not received a single phone call since yesterday morning. Kosher cola and tofu salad I can do: disconnection from the world I cannot. No matter, I arranged to have people over, back when I had a life, so tonight should be more fun. Sourcing poncey nibbles from independent delis is an expensive business, but it scores big points with the bourgeois guests. No brand booze however just looks low-rent. Microbrewed beer may be acceptable, but spirits and mixers are all about the labels. Do I pour the Lidl paint stripper into old bottles of Absolut and hope no one notices? No, I must stand firm. Being a generally shallow urbanite, I previously used to define myself by carefully chosen brands and status symbols. In their absence, I come to understand that one can define oneself by one's political leanings instead. I am a recovering consumer whore and former slave to The Man, I tell my baffled guests. By the night's end, I have litres of cheap shit vodka left over. A non-believer slipped out for Stolichnaya instead. Philistines.</p> <p><strong>Day 4</strong></p> <p>By far and away the most successful day so far, on account of being too trashed to get out of bed or even turn on the light. It's true, the only way to fully escape the evils of corporate consumerism is to sit quietly in a dark room. That I didn't buy any ethically produced paracetamol is (literally) a crying shame, and the prospect of three more days of this is a depressing one.</p> <p><strong>Day 5</strong></p> <p>Bruiser is back on the air after an apparent DTI bust. To be honest, the playlist is beginning to sound like one annoying ringtone and I'm missing Sarah Montague's inane chuckle. I'm now a consumer of Good Energy, a small ethically sound company whose adverts have pictures of wind farms and everything. On the line to disconnect from British Gas, I feel like I'm directly sticking it to the system. Unfortunately, the woman at their Indian call centre doesn't register my triumphalism, and the moment is lost. Stealing, sorry, sharing music files over the web surely can't be classed as consumption. I boot up Limewire (yes, I am using a Mac during the week: I'm not writing this with pencil and bloody paper) and the Top 40 re-enters my world. It dawns on me that theft could be the answer to all my problems here. Pay for wholesome stuff and thieve the rest: costing them money as opposed to withholding it. Later at the corner shop, I consider snaffling a Toblerone, only to bottle it during the getaway. Pathetic.</p> <p><strong>Day 6</strong></p> <p>Everywhere I turn, The Man is waiting to relieve me from my cash. At home, at work, in the street, and in the boozer; the only refuge is inside my head and that's currently preoccupied with a fantasy involving 21st Century Fox, an Odeon multiplex and a value bag of Kit Kat Cubes. They won, we lost. There is no alternative to mindless consumption and I want it back right now. Day seven can't come quickly enough.</p> <p><strong>Day 7</strong></p> <p>Good and bad news on my final day. The BPI announces they're to sue people who pinch music on the web, so I'm probably going down for this article. On the brighter side, I receive an astonishing pamphlet from McDonald's begging me to pop in and see how much they've changed since Fast Food Nation/Super Size Me, etc. They serve cappuccino now, and there's 70% fewer tramps instore too. Besides this minor victory, the world hasn't really altered since I started this crusade: Fresh &amp; Wild's takings are up, my movements are more regular with all the whole food, and I now have some sense of purpose beyond directional sportswear. But the high street hasn't transformed into the haven of independent fairtrade consumption I'd hoped. Totting up the bills (food and cosmetics huge, transport and entertainment next to nothing) I reckon I'm evens with my normal outlay: there's literally nothing to buy beyond the basics unless you're feeling hemp utility slacks and seagrass handbags. The mental time spent is much greater though: ignoring the incessant, hypnotic drone of advertising/ retail/media/everything requires Trappist monk-like dedication which has left me exhausted. Ending the week with a return trip to HMV megastore, I concede that an all-out boycott is perhaps a little harsh. I make a deal with myself to continue the spending war on selective brands, ie the ones I never consumed much anyway. Trading Places, alas, is sold out.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Corporation is out on Friday</p>",
  "<p>It was no surprise that two people in Fanelli's Bar and Grill were reading Philip Roth's new novel, The Plot Against America. Fanelli's is the left epicentre of Soho, a manufacturing district in lower Manhattan that became home to artists and galleries in the 1970s and now is filled with Euro-shoppers. Tourists avoid Fanelli's - grimy, badly lit, air-conditioned down almost to absolute zero - leaving in peace the elderly union organisers, greying sculptors and the odd younger family feeding enormous Italian meatballs to children in prams. </p> <p>Roth's novel, a fantasy of fascism overwhelming America at the beginning of the second world war, is a story that people in my local worry might become fact. In Roth's novel, the charming, empty-headed airman Charles Lindbergh comes to power in 1940, manipulated by a vicious vice-president. The outside world frightened Americans; domestic purges of Jewish-Communist-terrorists reassured them. The novel has a pedigree; in the 1930s Nathaniel West wrote A Cool Million and Sinclair Lewis It Can't Happen Here , both horror stories of Americans embracing right-wing despots out of innocence and fear. Like his ancestors, Roth is far too gifted to write a piece of crude agit-prop. He relies on the news to make the modern connections for him. </p> <p>My first day back from London, labouring over a Fanelli cheeseburger cooked to the consistency of leather, the television was tuned to a discussion of the Patriot Act. </p> <p>In its first version, passed shortly after the terrorist destruction of the World Trade Centre in 2001, the act gave the government new surveillance powers (called \"data mining\") over individual citizens, while cloaking the government's own operations in greater secrecy. Patriot Act II, a draft of which was first leaked in February 2003, proposed to go much further. For instance, US citizens could be stripped of their citizenship if the government believed they belonged to a terrorist organisation; this would be purely an administrative decision, as would be the deportation of non-nationals who threaten America's \"national defence, foreign policy, or economic interests\", in the words of the draft. </p> <p>In the bar, people watched in stunned silence a dispassionate, juridical discussion of these proposals on the tube, occasionally glancing through the dirty windows to the crowd surging outside, who seemed somewhere else, far away. The scene in the bar sums up my strongest impression, in the weeks since I've returned, of the American intelligentsia - an honourable word here. Bushism has made intellectuals afraid of their own country. </p> <p>Four blocks from Fanelli's, the cartoonist Art Spiegelman presented his new book In the Shadow of No Towers a few weeks ago at the Cooper Union, New York's version of Toynbee Hall. At first no establishment publisher would touch this story in pictures of how Spiegelman's family lived through the attack of September 11 and its aftermath; he was too \"political\" in asserting the bombing had been high-jacked by politicians. At Cooper Union, the street-smart, chain-smoking Spiegelman reliably provoked laughter as he jibed at President George W Bush, silence when he compared the scenes in his new book with those of Maus, his comic-strip novel about Nazis. Had he gone too far? Spiegelman kept going. He turned the knife by remarking that the only Americans who were not afraid now were the New Yorkers who lived through the attack. The knife twist reminded me of a question put to me last Christmas by a British soldier: how long would Americans have endured the Blitz? </p> <p>\"Fascism\" is both a strong and an opaque word. Discussions here about whether America is threatened by fascism have been focused this autumn by the appearance of Robert Paxton's The Anatomy of Fascism. An historian of Vichy France at Columbia University, Paxton calmly explores rather than rants about fascism as \"democracy gone wrong\" in Europe from 1919 to 1939. Yet its final chapter has roused debate because Paxton argues that democracy can go wrong whenever far-right beliefs intersect with conservative economic and political institutions, and that the longing for an iron grip is much more than historical accident. Light references to Israel and the United States evince Paxton's prudence yet his readers have not taken these suggestions lightly. </p> <p>We could think of fascism itself as either hard or soft. Hard fascism rams home to the citizen that he or she is held in that iron grip, as in Mussolini's theatre of force or George Orwell's nightmare Nineteen Eighty-four. Soft fascism is not so much a velvet glove as an invisible hand, the operations of control hidden from scrutiny as Patriot Act II, and more, internal repression presented to the public as merely preventive action against threats that have yet to materialise. The Bush administration acted in this preventive way, for instance, by shutting three of the larger Muslim charities in America, not for anything they had done, but for what might happen, some time, somewhere. In hard fascism the state exploits concrete fear, in soft fascism the state exploits diffuse anxiety. </p> <p>\"Security\" takes on a peculiar meaning in soft fascism. Perhaps the most disturbing book to appear this year, Jeffrey Rosen's The Naked Crowd, illuminates the twisted experience of security. In Rosen's view, reality TV and its like have made invasion of privacy into popular entertainment. The pleasure of stripping away privacy fits into an economy where high-tech firms such as Oracle make large profits from developing personal data bases, listening devices, and auditing software for business. Government destruction of private rights thus become \"naturalised\": the public already enjoys the act of stripping people naked, and this intrusion is just an extension of how business gets done in the computer age. </p> <p>Diffuse anxieties only add further fuel to this \"naturalised\" process. Insecurity about what might happen, some time, somewhere, becomes an ongoing state of mind; it co-habits with preventive measures, but these draconian measures do not erase unease. Indeed, as the state machine acts stealthily to prevent things happening, as its technologies become built into the fabric of everyday business practice, there can be no defining moment when an ordinary citizen could declare, \"now I am more secure\". </p> <p>Is America menaced by soft fascism, as many intellectuals fear? As the autumn has progressed, the iron grip of Bushism has loosened, due to the regime's practical failures abroad. To his credit, Senator John Kerry has recognised something more is at stake; though chastised by the left as weak, the language he speaks aims to be reassuring. Even if Bush is voted out, though, the half of the nation for which he speaks will not lose its anxiety. The answer to my question lies in the domestic circumstances of America for which terrorism has become a talisman of unease at home. </p> <p>It's become a journalistic cliche to divide America into red and blue states. The red states: southern and western, Republican, godly, abortion, gay and feminist unfriendly, militaristic. The blue states: eastern or coastal, Democratic, secular, identity-friendly, diplomatic. The country thus appears divided exactly in half. What these clich\u00e9s don't get at is something red and blue share, America's confused, fear-inducing experience of class. </p> <p>In a book that has come into its own this autumn, What's the Matter with Kansas?, Thomas Frank ponders how poor people in that heartland state, threatened with loss of work, lack of health insurance, or mounting family debt, address these woes. Preventing abortion or gay marriage seems some sort of solution; economics gets translated into culture. Like the retired union organisers in Fanelli's who yearn for the working-class politics of New York in the years after the Great Depression, Frank invokes \"false consciousness\" to explain what's happening now. </p> <p>Translating economic into cultural insecurity is nothing new. Nearly 40 years ago, when we researched The Hidden Injuries of Class , Jonathan Cobb and I found white workers in Boston blaming drop-out hippies and black ghetto culture for their own, unrelated labour and communal problems. And as an ideal, the cultural conservatism of the working classes idea stretches back into the 19th century and across the ocean, as in Disraeli's famous image of \"angels in marble\", the working classes whose everyday solidity awaits the sculpting hand of conservative leadership. </p> <p>What is new is the class map. Ironically, the British conservative Ferdinand Mount has drawn it in his new book, Mind the Gap. In the last generation, large numbers of people have come to feel excluded from the \"skills society\" or \"meritocracy\" of Blair's Britain and Clinton's America. These are people whose beliefs in self-discipline, hard work and family sacrifice do not yield much control over their own lives. As Mount points out, they feel left out and treated by the more agile with - at best - indifference. At Spiegelman's talk, he got a good laugh by saying he didn't know anybody in the American heartland. </p> <p>Loss of control is an economic fact, but a subtle one. More than in Britain, the wealth of America's middle classes has stagnated as the upper 10th has dramatically improved. To counter this stagnation, the middle class has taken on consumer debt it can barely manage, as Robert Manning has recently documented in Credit Card Nation. People have tried to spend their way into status, and now the bills are coming due, as personal bankruptcies have taken off. </p> <p>The same loss of control appears, famously, in the shrinking number of jobs. The familiar villain is outsourcing of work to Mexico, China or India, but the familiar villain misleads. Auto-mation has finally arrived in America, shrinking white-collar service jobs and manufacturing alike. In the past 20 years, for instance, the US steel industry increased its productivity by four per cent while cutting its labour force from about 212,000 to 79,000 - a transformation due mostly to automation. Again, young people now leaving university find themselves offered jobs that formerly went to secondary-school graduates. As in Britain, low-wage immigrants in America flourish in the cracks of the formal economy, but their children and grandchildren increasingly do not. </p> <p>Is it \"false consciousness\" to counter these changes by prohibiting abortion or gay marriage? Translating economics into culture is both irrational and logical. In the wealthiest country on Earth, the economic engine rouses Ricardo's ancient spectre of uselessness; the class map is shrinking the number of people who matter, who are included. The new class map breeds fear, and the counter to fear is to assert that the old values matter. By shifting the centre of gravity, you assert your own value when confronted with conditions you can do nothing about. </p> <p>How this translation works is exemplified by perhaps the most controversial book to appear in America this season, Samuel Huntington's Who are We? He is well known to Brits for his previous book, The Clash of Civilizations , which argued an inevitable global conflict between Islam and the west; this new book minia turises the same argument within America. Now Mexicans appear as local Muslims, an alien, unmelting presence refusing to play by American rules. The book is less remarkable for its ethnic prejudices than for its invocation of \"traditional\" American values, wrapped up in a Protestant non-conformist, small-town, package; Huntington proudly asserts he is \"anti-cosmopolitan\", world-travelled Harvard professor that he is. Though most Mexican immigrants happen to live in abject poverty, that is not the point; he is \"defending America\". </p> <p>This is indeed an apology for soft fascism. Fearful of the present, the outside, the alien, the defender of America looks backward to a mythical golden age in Puritan New England. But now the white anglo-saxon Protestant is armoured with a computer. The culture of soft fascism cannot be reduced to the traditional bogeymen of the American left: even in its liberal years, the United States was an ardently religious country; Americans were ardent nationalists even when they fought for Europe in the two world wars. Nor is the appeal of soft fascism to be treated with simple contempt. The terror attack tripped a domestic switch about experiences of marginality that people have trouble naming and about which they can do little. Abroad, Bushism registers a wounded national honour; at home, confusion about living honourably. </p> <p>In the years I've lived in London, I've often been asked why American intellectuals were so slow to respond to the threats of soft fascism. In a way this criticism is unfair; while the New York Times temporarily lost its nerve, the New York Review of Books didn't. It's certainly true that individuals like Susan Sontag were attacked for being disloyal for saying things about American imperialism that are commonplace in London. (She also didn't lose her nerve.) And until this year - and perhaps too late - policy-makers and thinkers in the Democratic party were on the defensive. </p> <p>A kind of archaic residue from the McCarthy era is one explanation. Though most 20th-century wars were fought under Democratic presidents, liberals have had to prove their patriotism as conservatives have not. But the denizens of my local - myself included - provide more of an answer. </p> <p>For a long time the American intellectual left has been out of touch with the American people. It has spoken in the name of the people but not to them. Now, in the reconfigured landscape of economics, class and culture, however, the educated, cosmopolitan liberal is a social victor. Even the sculptor in Fanelli's struggling to make ends meet is a social victor; nobody can rob him of his work and worth. </p> <p>The right has perhaps understood that victory better than the victors themselves, in giving fresh life to the taunts of \"cultural elitism\" aimed at the intellectual left. The attack embodies a classic dilemma: when a young man with a good degree and an expensive lap-top attacks injustice, the ordinary person feels patronised. </p> <p>For the past four years, the rich and powerful in America have capitalised on just this social distance, between the cultural elite and people beset by anxieties about personal insufficiency and mutual respect. The victors have defended themselves by saying, but we are just like you, loyal Americans; the defence rings false because they aren't domestically the same. Those bewildered glances out of Fanelli's window, the knowing sniggers at Cooper Union, are signs of an inequality as ambiguous as the word \"American\". </p> <p>The books I've touched on evoke what could happen as a result of the anxieties besetting the country now, their exploitation on the right, and indifference, bewilderment, or paternalism on the left. The solution to soft fascism may, however, lie far beyond party politics. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Sennett teaches sociology at the London School of Economics.

  "<p>There is an image of Jonny Wilkinson hanging high on hoardings that seems to say so much about Wilkinson and Englishness. It is an advert for Hackett clothes - blazers, shirts, ties, very formal, very smart. Wilkinson is appealing to a specific type of person. He looks successful, regimented, invincible, and stuffed with certainties. It fulfils a stereotype of the classic English Man, the rugger bugger. </p> <p>And, at first sight, Wilkinson is the classic rugger bugger. Actually, he is more than that - he's rugby union's real-life Boy's Own hero. He won his first England cap when he was 18 (the youngest player to represent the country since the first world war), he broke the points-scoring record set by his mentor, Rob Andrew, when he was just 21, he became the world's best fly half (a team's play-maker) and he scored more points than any other player in the 2003 World Cup finals. What makes him unique, apart from the phenomenal scoring, is that he is also a great defender who loves to tackle. It is this that makes him so susceptible to injury and is why so many experts believe that the Jonny Wilkinson who returns to the England side as captain next month will not be the same player. To top it off, he scored the supreme drop goal that won the final in the last seconds of extra time in Australia, against Australia. He was still only 24. There were two dominant sporting images in 2003 - Wilkinson cupping his hands, as if in prayer, before scoring yet another penalty goal, and Wilkinson kicking the winning points from his hands. Of course, he won sports personality of the year. </p> <p>Things could only go downhill from there. And they did. Rapidly. He suffered a shoulder injury that kept him out of the game for almost a year and could well have cost him his career. He had an operation that stood a tiny chance of leaving him permanently paralysed. Meanwhile, in his absence, there were ructions in the England rugby team - players retired, inspirational coach Clive Woodward announced he was quitting to pursue a career in the more lucrative sphere of football, and the shambolic world champions lost game after game. </p> <p>But, as you'd expect of Wilkinson, he has fought back. Now sporting a neat post-operative scar down the back of his neck like a number 1, he is again playing rugby for his club team, the Newcastle Falcons. There has been widespread criticism of his form, and the Cassandras of the rugby world are already forecasting that he will never be the player he once was. Yet he has not only been recalled to the England team, he has been made captain. </p> <p>At the Falcons ground there are painters and decorators galore, drilling workmen, club secretaries and a press officer, but no sign of Wilkinson. Despite the hefty investment by football magnate Sir John Hall, and despite Wilkinson's presence, the Falcons are still an unfashionable club in a city where football reigns supreme. Rugby fans often wonder what Wilkinson is doing in Newcastle, rather than living it up with top clubs such as Leicester or Sale. </p> <p>The club press officer asks what we are doing here. We explain that we are waiting for Wilkinson. Well, he'll leave us to it, he says indifferently. \"If it's been organised by his agent, I'm not running around looking for players.\" Wilkinson doesn't get the prima donna treatment at Newcastle. The secretary tells us that he is out training with the lads - extra training, I presume, after the club's recent poor run. </p> <p>Wilkinson eventually walks in, apologising as he takes off his boots - size eights. He wears them as tight as possible to boost his phenomenally accurate kicking. He throws his bag on the floor, his car keys to the side, and changes his trainers. He is wearing a T-shirt and jogging pants. He looks different from the clothes adverts - scruffier, less formal, warmer. </p> <p>I ask him what he had for breakfast. \"Why d'you ask?\" he grins. Because I want to know how many eggs you had? \"Eight this morning.\" Eight? \"Yeah, eight. Only egg whites. We take the yolks out.\" What's all that about, the yolks are the best bit? \"Yeah, but unfortunately they're the unhealthy part. It's the same with all food, isn't it? The bit that makes it fantastic is the bit that's bad for you.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson, aged 25, is famously obsessive about his diet and his training. He practises his kicking at least six days a week for up to eight hours. He completes each session with six kicks at goal from different positions, and won't stop until he has scored every one in the sequence - it once took him five hours. \"I can't rest until I have tamed the devil in my head,\" he says. He trains to the point at which \"my body is screaming at me and I feel like I'm going to be sick\". At times, Rob Andrew, the Newcastle Falcons director of rugby, has had to hide the balls from him. In the evening he comes home and eats up to 13 fillets of chicken. He refuses to go into a fast-food outlet even to use the toilet. </p> <p>I ask him what's his first memory of rugby. \"Being three years old and having a tiny green jacket and wellington boots on the side of the rugby field with my dad passing a little orange plastic ball around. My brother Mark was playing, he was four, and I was on the sidelines, just running up and down, chucking this little ball around. At the age of four I got pretty much into it.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson grew up in Surrey. His family took sport seriously. Does he think the competitive thing came from his mother or father? \"Both. My mum played squash for the county. My dad was a very good cricketer, a lovely player. He's got incredible pride. He's very motivated.\" As kids, didn't you and Mark ever think you were just a bit over-competitive, a tiny bit odd? No, he says, they were too busy competing to think about stuff like that. \"We just couldn't do it without actually giving it everything. We used to hate swimming, but we'd be in the swimming tournaments at school and it would be like, 'I really hate this, I wish we weren't doing this', then, as soon as you dive in the water, it's just, like, go for broke.\" </p> <p>He and Mark, 17 months older, decided from a young age that it was unhealthy to compete against each other. Was Wilkinson as competitive about, say, geography? \"No, I wasn't academically motivated.\" But even as he's saying it, he's having a rethink. \"I hated geography and history, but I couldn't bear getting bad marks.\" He left his private school with A-levels in biology, chemistry and French - an A and two Bs - and was preparing to read sports in the community at Durham University. But his games master from school, Steve Bates, moved to the north-east to coach Newcastle rugby team, asked him if he fancied turning professional, and that was it. </p> <p>Alongside the competitiveness existed an equally intense nervousness. As a boy, he was often sick in the car when his father took him to matches. If he lost or played badly, he became morose and impossible to comfort. \"From the earliest time I can remember, I've been a very nervous individual - not nervous because of being scared, not physically scared, just frightened of letting myself down or letting other people down or just losing. It just causes that kind of anxiety.\" It's all of a piece; the nerves are umbilically linked to the desire to do well and his pride in performance. </p> <p>There are certain words, such as \"pride\" and \"humble\", that Wilkinson returns to time and again. \"It's very much a pride thing,\" he says about his nerves. \"I know what it's like to lose and be disappointed, and the feeling for me is so intensely bad that I just don't want to go through it, and it's all mixed into one with wanting to achieve things and be successful. You chuck it all on one day, one opportunity, and it just causes that kind of anxiety.\" </p> <p>He seems so different from the Hackett Jacket man in the adverts - yes, certain in his goals, but in so many ways uncertain in himself. He is sheepish about his obsessions, but open and eloquent about them. Wilkinson talks quietly, with a diffident, melancholy streak. He smiles a lot - mainly when addressing his many weird habits. He's just written an autobiography, My World. It's one of those books designed for people who don't like reading - lots of handsome pictures and few words. Even so, he describes movingly his fear, the way he can be half-paralysed with fear. </p> <p>I tell him it made me want to hug him and that he may be the world's best, but surely it can't be worth all this pain? He smiles. \"It's a bit of a 'I can't live with it and can't live without it' thing. Every week you go through those feelings, you get through one weekend and you know the next one is just around the corner, but at the same time, when I was injured, it was the thing I missed the most. Getting through those periods and succeeding in those times are what I'm sure I will remember clearest and longest. To be honest, I'm more worried about what I'm going to do when I do give it up, to find a substitute for that kind of buzz - to go out and know that everything is on the line.\" </p> <p>He tells me about a Peanuts cartoon he used to have on his wall where Charlie Brown walks around saying he is really worried because he has nothing to worry about. The strange thing is that, on the pitch, Wilkinson is known for his unflappability, his karma. Even his approach to penalty kicks is based on the yoga technique of centring, channelling all his inner energy from a core point behind his navel. He doesn't quite know how or why, but he says somehow his hands just evolved into that prayer position. </p> <p>In many ways he lives the life of an ascetic. But the sacrifices he's made have mostly been easy, he says - egg yolks, for example. \"The things I wonder about more are the things I never did, not the things I gave up. University, for example. I wonder now whether I would have a bigger circle of friends that I could maybe look towards when times get very intense; if I could go to people that are not involved in rugby and don't think of me as rugby, if I could have experienced more things.\" Mark (6ft 3in, 17 stone and known as Sparks to his friends) went to university, then worked at a leisure centre before turning professional. Wilkinson (5ft 10in, barrel-chested and 14 stone) is sure his brother benefited from having a wider circle and having lived a bit. </p> <p>Does he think he would have done all the laddish things young men do if he'd gone to university? \"Erm, no,\" he says with a grin. Wilkinson has been going out with his girlfriend, Diana Stewart, for two years. She works for Sky Sports and lives in London. </p> <p>It's strange he's found himself a hero of this sport. Most of the anecdotes in his book feature colleagues flashing their willies or pulling down their trousers (not him, of course - he refuses to be photographed without his shirt on). \"Yeah, right! Tell me about it!\" he giggles. So I do: I have a theory - it's useful for him to have the excuse of looking after his body, because being blokey and getting pissed and flashing his willy would be unbearable for him. \"Yeah, right!\" he says again. \"Well, God, I haven't been for a night out for coming up to a year and a half now. I haven't drunk for a year and a half. It's not something I miss because it's not something I perceive as important to my life. My life is about being healthy and getting the most out of the opportunities I've been given.\" </p> <p>He can be fabulously puritanical (about alcohol, about wasters who fail to fulfil their potential, about players who allow themselves to be photographed topless), but more than a desire to impose his own values, it is, perhaps, a means of masking his own shyness. I can't help thinking of the bus journey through the crowds in London after the World Cup victory - whereas the others drank in the atmosphere and had a thoroughly good time, Wilkinson shrank into the background, crippled with shyness. </p> <p>Did it stop him enjoying it? \"Yeah, it's just not ... \" He trails off, and starts again. \"I did enjoy it. Deep down I really enjoyed it.\" But he didn't look as if he did. Soon after returning home, he said that he couldn't cope with the attention he was receiving; that while he was grateful for the support, it was making him \"uptight, angry and depressed\". </p> <p>True heroes, he says, are world leaders such as Nelson Mandela, or legendary sportsmen such as American footballer Walter Payton or basketball player Michael Jordan. But don't you see that is just how your fans regard you? \"No,\" he says, and he develops a semi-stutter. \"What I do is, I cannot, I cannot understand it enough and therefore it's confusing to me and I feel like a bit of a fraud.\" </p> <p>He says it's unfair that he gets the bulk of the attention. Take Mark, for instance - his brother is in the Newcastle squad but is not a first-team regular - \"I look at someone like my brother, who works as hard as he does with the rugby here, but also does more unselfish things. My brother does his kicking day in, day out, and because of the way I am, I'll be be out there for another hour and a half and he'll just stand by the post, catch balls and kick them back to me. He doesn't say a word; he doesn't say, 'Oh, for Christ's sake, I'm bored stiff here, can we go?' He just stands there and does it until I'm happy, and you think, nobody comes up to him and says thanks for that.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson talks of Mark with such love, I wonder whether it has been hard for both of them that he is much the better player. For the only time, he shakes his head and disagrees sharply. But you have been more successful, haven't you? \"I'd probably say better known and more fortunate. But I go out and train and watch him kick the ball 30 yards further than me time and time again, and I think he's pretty special. I like to work at myself to try to make sure I have every ability, but it doesn't mean that I can be as naturally gifted as him in the way he kicks a ball as far as he does or the way he passes.\" </p> <p>He and Mark share a house outside Newcastle in the Northumbrian countryside. His parents followed from Surrey and now his father, a former financial adviser, acts as his manager. Wilkinson says one of the most important goals left for him to achieve is to help Mark realise his potential as a player. \"It's more a case of paying back. He helps me every day, so unfortunately his support and my family's support and my friends' support have put me at a level, not a level, a place, where with international commitments, I don't actually have very much time left, but I want to make sure that, the time I do have left, I pay it back as much as I can to make sure he goes to the level he wants to. Otherwise, you finish with a lot of take from me and not a lot of give. I don't want him to sacrifice his opportunities for me.\" </p> <p>Is there anything he'd swap with his brother? Oh yes, he says, with relish, he would love his social ease, his ability to relax and put things in perspective. In a way, Wilkinson says, he is more relaxed with strangers these days, addressing a large audience - something Mark would run a million miles from. \"Yet in terms of being able to be around people he knows and be funny and tell jokes and mess around, he's a lot better than me. If we're in a group, I'm likely to be fairly quiet.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson isn't a religious man, but he could easily be mistaken for one. He likes to imagine he lives his life in front of a 24-hour camera (ironic, considering his desire for privacy) and that at the end of each day he can rest assured he's not let anyone down. \"It's a kind of religion, a set of standards that you live by. And it's having the pride not to drop below them, regardless of what outside pressures creep in. To say this is the way I am, this is the way I want to be, and to try to stand strong through whatever else happens. There are certain vows you make and you stick to them.\" </p> <p>Is that a moral code? \"Yeah, I think so, yeah. It's a moral code and a professional code. In sport it's professional, in life it's moral. It is about how you treat people. Like when I'm on the way to a game and I know I can't sign things, so I say to them, 'Look, I'll be around after the game, and I'll do as many then' - that to me is a way of doing it. And you don't say that and then sneak out of the back door.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson has to go off to a team meeting. He says he'll be back in half an hour, but he takes longer. To pass the time, I sneak a look at some papers he's left on the table - speeches for various kids' charities he supports. He's a bit terse when he returns. They've not dropped you, have they, I say. \"Not that I know of.\" He smiles. </p> <p>I ask if he was hard as a kid. No, he says, he never fought - he found that kind of thing intimidating. He was simply very sporty. But surely you need to be aggressive to play rugby? He nods. \"You have to lose a bit of yourself. You can't expect to come out of games completely unhurt. You need to have a sort of reckless side where you can throw yourself into a situation.\" </p> <p>He looks remarkably unscarred for a man who has spent his life belting and being belted. He's never broken his nose. There's a scar on his head, the post-operative zip on his neck, he's had loads on his lips and eyes, and his ears have been ripped and stitched five or six times. Are you allowed to scream \"ouch\" on the pitch, or is that regarded as unseemly? No, he says, it's fine to, \"so long as it's not a cowering ouch!\" </p> <p>After the World Cup, everyone wanted Wilkinson's endorsement. He turned down everything he didn't actively like; even so, it's hard to get away from one image or another of Jonny Wilkinson. Does he think he is in danger of invading his own privacy? Yes, he concedes, he has worried about it, but ultimately he doesn't seek out or use the paparazzi, so he thinks it's fair that they respect his desire to be left alone. </p> <p>A poll recently voted him the most shaggable man in Britain, I mention. He doesn't know where to look. He really is flustered. When he finally manages to get his words out, he says, \"You see that automatically causes feelings of repulsion in me.\" And he does look as if he could be sick. \"I just can't stand the idea of it. Ugh ! Mad, absolutely mad.\" Look, I say, enjoy it. But he can't. He's not insulted, he just can't imagine it. \"If people knew ... what people see of me, I compare with the fact that I spend Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday leaving home, going to the club, training, kicking balls, going to the gym, maybe pop to the cinema, maybe pop out for a meal, eating loads of food, sitting at home relaxing, then one day a week suddenly you're thrust into that environment where you're playing that sport in front of thousands of people.\" In short, he seems to be arguing, he's too dull to be a sex symbol. </p> <p>After the World Cup, he feared his world would never turn normally again. Being stopped constantly by supporters left him grateful, but anxious and depressed. He also thinks the media have changed in their attitude to him - sports commentators, he says, are less sympathetic. \"I've always maintained that my expectations of my own performance will be way, way higher than anybody else's, but people's expectations are so high now. Your game is going to be pulled apart, regardless of how everyone else plays.\" He's right. The critics have been merciless. I listened to a panel of experts on telly saying he wasn't good enough for England any more. \"Exactly, that's where everything has changed.\" They said you're not as fearless as you were ... \"That is just rubbish.\" </p> <p>Did he hear that himself? \"No, that is why I don't watch these things - all that is important to me is making sure I am accountable to my close friends and my family and my team-mates and the coaches.\" He pauses. \"It's not a brilliant feeling to understand that people are saying this,\" he says quietly. </p> <p>Both the injury and the comeback have forced him to reassess his career. After seven years of professional rugby and the World Cup triumph, he thought he'd seen it all, but now he says he's faced with different and difficult challenges every day - and new fears, of course. He says he can't wait to captain England, and reminisces that since childhood both he and Mark have loved to lead. </p> <p>Is he a shouter on the pitch? \"Yeah, definitely. That's what the will to win is.\" You sound so different when you're playing? \"I am a different person. It's like a split personality. Throughout the week I have one side of me that does all the preparation and resting and eating well and training, then it hands all that over to the second individual, and that other individual is a hugely competitive, instinctive one who is just desperate to win. He is a bit of a monster, actually.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson puts his rugby boots back on. He's off for another training session. On the way out we talk about obsessions. His latest is playing his guitar. He started playing in the hope of finding a hobby, a distraction, and now it's already another obsession. </p> <p>Does he think all great sportsmen are obsessive? \"I think you have to be. Being healthily obsessive is not a bad thing. I used to be scared of saying to people I am obsessive, but I am not now because that's the way it is for me - it's an obsession.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> My World, by Jonny Wilkinson, is published by Headline at \u00a320.

  "<p>For nearly 15 years I wrote hundreds of letters that weren't from me. They ranged from perfunctory thank-you notes and expressions of condolence, to extensive correspondence with the great and the good: politicians, newspaper editors, bishops, members of the House of Lords. The procedure I followed with a more intimate letter was to type it up, double-spaced in large font, and print it out. My employer - the sender of the letter - would then copy it painstakingly on to embossed notepaper using a Mont Blanc pen and blotting paper, signing it with a flourish at the bottom. </p> <p>Aside from the correspondence, I wrote a great many newspaper articles, speeches, the occasional poem, and several books. The books generated many reviews and profiles of the man whose name appeared on the cover. A number of literati entered into correspondence with the \"author\", unaware that the replies also came from a hired hand. We make a great team, the author often said. And we did. </p> <p>Ghost-writing is not new. It might almost qualify as the oldest profession if prostitution had not laid prior claim. And there is more than a random connection between the two: they both operate in rather murky worlds, a fee is agreed in advance and given \"for services rendered\", and those who admit to being involved, either as client or service-provider, can expect negative reactions - anything from mild shock and disapproval to outright revulsion. A professor at my old university, a distinguished classicist with feminist leanings, was appalled when she heard what I did for a living and pronounced me \"no better than a common whore\". This - the whiff of whoredom - is perhaps the main reason why people opt for absolute discretion. </p> <p>Over the years I learned a great deal about vanity, the desire to belong, the lengths a man will go to in pretending to be something other than he is. And the lengths a woman will go to in colluding with the pretence. </p> <p>I had never met anyone so strange and flamboyant - like a rare and tropical bird. His plumage was a wonder to behold; when he flapped his wings the lining of his jacket dazzled and glinted like a prism. He wore a large sapphire in his lapel, a vivid silk tie, one pink sock, one green. There were two gold watches on his right wrist and a platinum one on his left, and on his fingers a collection of jewels - rubies, emeralds, diamonds. </p> <p>\"You are going to enjoy working for me. I have a good feeling about it,\" he said. \"My motto is when we work, we work, and when we play, we play. That way everybody is happy, isn't it?\" </p> <p>His office was a spacious penthouse overlooking the heart of Soho. The first thing I noticed were the pictures on the walls - an assortment of naked or semi-naked women and several large cats clawing their way out of gilt-edged frames. But the centrepiece, mounted on the wall behind the leather-topped desk, was not a painting at all: it was a huge tiger skin complete with head. Apart from the fact that it was dead, it seemed very alive, its bold orange and black stripes setting the wall ablaze. </p> <p>\"I identify with the tiger,\" he said, without a hint of abashment. \"The tiger eats everything, but nothing eats him. He will even eat a crocodile if he wants to! He is King of the Mountain, King of the Forest, King of the World.\" He drew himself up, regally, in his chair. The tiger's head was just above the talking head, its eyes shining brightly, curiously round and manlike. For just a second, in that little corner where fantasy and reality collide, the two heads merged and became one. </p> <p>\"What would you like me to call you?\" I asked as we shook hands on parting. </p> <p>\"You can call me what you like,\" he said. \"I shall call you Beloved - all the girls who work for me are Beloved - but you can call me whatever you want.\" </p> <p>\"In that case,\" I said, \"I shall call you Tiger.\" </p> <p>\"I like it,\" he said, and kissed my hand. </p> <p>Arriving in Tiger's publishing house for the first time was like turning up in someone else's dream. It seemed a very long way down the rabbit hole. It felt high-voltage and slightly dangerous. There were abnormally high levels of emotion - lots of spirited laughter, shrieking and embracing. The atmosphere seemed to teeter on the edge of hysteria, and it was hard to work out the sounds. Were they angry, or were they just loud? I suppose I had the mistaken idea that only clever, serious people worked with books, and that they probably operated in a quiet, meticulous and, well, bookish manner. I had pictured earnest men of letters, old-fashioned gentlemen, slightly tweedy and with pale skin that was seldom exposed to natural light. </p> <p>In fact, the building sizzled with youthful vigour, in the shape of stunning, sophisticated young women. They had patrician accents, exceptional poise and uncommonly long legs. Their skin was not pale but healthy and bronzed. And there wasn't a man in sight. Here in this office, in 1981, women ruled. Yet there were no bluestockings, only silk stockings. The offices covered four floors, with staircases slightly aslant and walls off-centre. The furnishings were quite shabby and a layer of black London dust rested on the surfaces. Everywhere there were piles of books and high-rise manuscripts. And, curiously for a publishing house, there were clothes suspended in doorways and draped from light fittings, as if the premises might actually be shared with a dressmaker. Boas and belts hung on the backs of chairs, and on several doors there were coat-hangers bearing evening gowns and stylish jackets. In the loo I found underwear, tights and nail varnish. </p> <p>Tiger had a conglomerate of companies connected with publishing, fashion, films and theatre. He had been dubbed \"a cultural tycoon\" by the Times and he lived up to this dubbing assiduously. The ethos in the empire was not one of profit and loss, but of name and fame. Like its proprietor, the publishing house was sui generis, and it had a reputation quite disproportionate to its size. It was known to be radical and risk-taking. Tiger took chances with books and seemed to act mostly on impulse. He would meet people at parties and sign them on the spot. Sudden ideas were converted into improbable publishing ventures, and books were invented that ought never to have existed. He acted speedily and never flinched from taking a decision. He loved controversy, courted it indeed, and any whiff of scandal merely strengthened his resolve to publish. \"Let them sue! Let them sue!\" he would say, rubbing his hands together. \"But I am a fighter, and I fight to win!\" Tiger basked in this image, and we basked in it too. By association, we felt as if we were also fighters, that we too would win, and although at editorial meetings there was hardly ever a discernible rational plan, the atmosphere was highly charged and there was a lot of heady talk about noble ideals. </p> <p>\"Do you like my girls?\" Tiger asked not long after I had started my new job. \"They are amazing, isn't it?\" His girls were scarcely ever out of the gossip columns and they always knew somebody who knew somebody. Their most important work, as Tiger himself affirmed, was done out of office hours - at dinner parties, first nights, charity events, gallery openings, fashion shoots and hunt balls - for they ensured that news of his latest exploits was trawled through London's most fashionable hotspots. The smart outfits hanging from the office doors began to make sense. I was introduced to Cosima, Selina, Lucinda, Davina, Samantha and two Sophias. There seemed to be a conspicuous homogeneity of Christian names. Surely there ought to be a collective noun for this phenomenon, I thought, this concentration of cognates. An assonance perhaps? An artillery? I then met Andrea (a Baroness) and Sabrina (an heiress), and in due course, Alethea, Nigella, Eliza, Candida, Mariella, Zelfa, Georgia, Henrietta and Arabella. It was a lot to take in, the sort of list I would have been made to learn by rote at school, like books of the Bible or irregular Latin verbs. </p> <p>It was clear that I did not belong in this world. I was looked upon, with some justification, as one of Tiger's whims; I lived in Scotland, worked largely from home, and turned up in London only for editorial meetings, staying for just a few days at any one time. I didn't know anyone. Not even anyone who knew anyone. At home in Scotland, there were two small children and a baby, the centre of my universe. But in the London office I never mentioned the fact that I was a mother. I was at pains to fit in, and I sensed that talk about children would not be wise. I therefore pretended to be someone else, someone I was not. </p> <p>My initial work as a translator fed into this pretence. To be any good as a translator you have to do a kind of disappearing act. As the years passed, I moved sideways and took another sort of invisible presence, one that also tried to catch the voice of the author and be a conduit for his creation. I became Tiger's ghost. </p> <p>Our partnership produced lots of newspaper articles, interviews with well-known figures and several non-fiction books. But although they brought Tiger a sense of fulfilment, there was no lasting contentment. Eventually he became convinced that the way ahead for us lay in a different sort of publication. The real test was the novel. </p> <p>\"We need to evolve,\" he said. </p> <p>I did not demur. </p> <p>It is 1994 and we are in Tiger's house in France. Tiger believes that France is the best place in the world to create a work of art. \"We will have everything we need - the best food, the finest wine, a high-tech music system, a studio to work in, the fresh Dordogne air.\" </p> <p>How to write a novel? How to write someone else's novel? These two questions seem absolutely central. \"What sort of novel are we thinking about?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"We are thinking about a beautiful novel, very beautiful,\" he says, and he looks somewhere into the middle distance, smiling rapturously, already transported by the sheer imagined beauty of it. \"And it will have a beautiful cover. We will make sure of that.\" He taps out the last six words on the table. </p> <p>\"But what genre are we talking about? Are we thinking of a romantic novel? A thriller?\" </p> <p>(These conversations are always conducted in the first person plural.) </p> <p>\"It will be thrilling, oh yes. And also romantic. Very romantic. </p> <p>\"Oh, yes.\" </p> <p>\"So, a love story then?\" </p> <p>\"But of course! It has to be a love story. People associate me with love. I am famous for love.\" </p> <p>\"What sort of love story do we have in mind?\" I ask, as if we are discussing wallpaper or home furnishings and he has to pick one from a limited range. \"Is the love requited or unrequited?\" </p> <p>\"Definitely requited. Oh yes, very requited.\" </p> <p>\"And who are the characters?\" </p> <p>Even by our standards this is becoming an odd exchange. </p> <p>\"Sweetie,\" he says, his tone long-suffering as if humouring an imbecile. \"It has to be the love between a man and a woman. Do you think I could write about poofters? No, it has to be a man and a woman - a beautiful woman and very sexy. There will be lots of sex, but very distinguished. We will do the sex beautifully. Isn't it?\" </p> <p>\"And do we have a storyline? Do we have any idea of what it is about?\" </p> <p>\"Of course, Beloved! I have thought of everything.\" He squeals the last word in a spasm of exuberance. \"Let me tell you the idea. It is very simple. There is a man ... he is like me somewhat ... he is married ... he falls in love with a woman ... there is a huge passion and then well, we will see what happens after that, isn't it?\" </p> <p>How to proceed? Write what you know, they always say. But what did I know? Suddenly I knew nothing. In a bid to avert panic I decided to make a list of things in my favour. The list was not long but it was a start: </p> <p>1. I have written a lot already (just not a novel). </p> <p>2. I have read lots of novels. </p> <p>For the first of these to count as an advantage you have to believe that all writing comes from the same place. I'm not sure that I do believe that. Writing prose is not writing fiction. The most I could hope for was that the experience of writing journalism, literary pieces, book reviews, and so on would act as some sort of training ground for writing a novel. As for reading a lot, there is, sadly, no causal connection between the fact of having read fiction and the ability to write fiction. I know this at an instinctive level, and I think perhaps I have always known it, but this did not prevent me gathering together dozens of novels and taking them to France in my suitcase. I did this partly in the hope of discovering how to write a novel, and partly because I thought the systematic approach might compensate for lack of inspiration. The next two days were spent dipping into books by Penelope Fitzgerald, Anne Tyler, Carol Shields, Beryl Bainbridge, Alison Lurie, Anne Fine, Jennifer Johnston. At the end of the second day I realised that I had been reading only women writers, surely a foolish exercise if I was to learn to write like a man. For the next two days, fighting off a slight feeling of frenzy, I read William Trevor, John Updike, Ian McEwan, Tim Parks, John Banville. </p> <p>What I discovered was that when time changes are handled well, you scarcely notice them; as a reader, you are perfectly happy to move through days and weeks and years, in either direction, provided your author has a safe pair of hands. The devices are subtle - the judicious use of a pluperfect tense, for instance, or the foreshortening of a character's history. The same applies to point of view: the narrator - even when the story is told in the first person - has various tricks up his sleeve to allow the reader to know what the other characters are thinking and feeling. And the handling of dialogue was a revelation. Critics are fond of saying, \"The dialogue doesn't work,\" but when it works well, it is, paradoxically, a kind of dialogue that people believe is spoken, or feel comfortable with, not what actually is spoken, which would not work at all. Often the very best dialogue is not in the least authentic. </p> <p>Who was to be \"our hero\", and the woman with whom he was to fall in love? The man, according to Tiger, was married, so perhaps his wife would also play a part in the story? Which made a total of three. From one or two remarks Tiger had made, I had a hunch that he already identified with the main character in the book. Confirmation came from an unexpected source, an interview with Tiger that appeared in the Scotsman newspaper around that time. </p> <p>\"... His whole demeanour suggests passion constrained. He cannot sit still for long. He talks quickly, almost imploringly, and the words tumble over each other ... From now on he is going to be a novelist. This is what is fresh. This is what is now. 'It is not going to be a beeg novel ... It will be more a philosophical and a literary book. It's about my love of women and what would happen - what the consequences would be of such a love if ... well, anyway, it's about a man who loves two women.'\" </p> <p>\"My love of women.\" There, I knew it. A dead giveaway. If it was a slip, it was surely a telling slip. There was now little doubt in my mind that Tiger saw himself as the protagonist. In some ways this simplified things - at least there was an abundance of source material to work on. But I soon realised that the fictional version of Tiger would have to be based on his own self-image. He could not be, like the most interesting characters in fiction, seriously flawed. No, our hero would have to be sensitive, compassionate, successful in business, of strong moral fibre, devout, impassioned and wise. He would probably also be something of a self-styled philosopher and he would have to have a great capacity for love. And so, to work. I sketched out a plan in which the main character would be a wealthy businessman whose ordered life would be turned upside-down by an extramarital affair. This would arrive like a bolt from the blue and would coincide with a crisis in his life - the death of his beloved mother. I tried this out on Tiger. He pulled a face. Something wasn't right. It wasn't immediately clear what it was. </p> <p>\"Darleeng, PLEEEase, do we have to have the death?\" He spoke imploringly, drawing out each word. </p> <p>\"You don't like the death?\" </p> <p>\"I don't like the death.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, caught a little off-guard, \"I do think we need to have some sort of crisis, and a funeral is always quite a good focal point in a novel.\" Then, gaining in confidence, \"Also, the emotional upheaval associated with bereavement would be a neat way of allowing the affair to take place. It would make it more understandable in a way.\" Now the coup de grace: \"I mean, we don't want to make him an uncaring bastard who cheats on his wife, do we?\" </p> <p>The mention of an uncaring bastard would surely be enough to win him round, but instead he pulled another face. I wasn't sure what was bothering him. He stroked his lower jaw and made a prolonged moaning noise. Eventually he said, \"It's no good. We have to find another crisis. You see, my mother is still alive and, well, I don't want to upset her.\" </p> <p>Gently but firmly, I suggested that it was important that the life of the main character was not matched in every single aspect with his own, indeed, it was essential that it wasn't; that the proposed book should be, in essence, a work of imagination; that it would be a pity if the critics dismissed it simply as a replica of his own life rather than a serious literary endeavour; and that it could quite properly reflect his own concerns while at the same time retaining its own artistic integrity. After which, he agreed - albeit somewhat ungraciously - to the death of his mother. </p> <p>For the next week or so, I tried to free up the flow by telling myself that it was just another job that had to be done, that none of this mattered, that I was free to write anything that came into my head. But the fact that I was writing with a mask on bedevilled the whole process. </p> <p>I decided to call the main character Carlo and make him a successful advertising executive living in London. The novel would begin with Carlo's return to his native Italy to attend his mother's funeral. The reason for giving him dual nationality was twofold: it fitted very generally with Tiger's own background, and it would act as a metaphor for further conflict and dichotomy. The trip to Italy was surely a stroke of genius: it would allow for our hero's journey in all senses - physical, mental, spiritual and emotional. It would also enable the affair to take place in the hot and steamy Mediterranean climate and, finally, it would conveniently provide the backdrop of Catholicism - Tiger's professed faith - which would in turn introduce the familiar tensions between faith and reason and passion. I warmed to my theme. </p> <p>I tried to think myself into what I imagined Tiger's style might be, but the more I searched for his voice, the more I caught my own breaking through; the more I tried to realise his literary aspirations, the more my own seemed to intrude. The novel did not grow organically; it was force-fed and boosted with steroids. Set pieces and ruminations on the human condition were thrown about like salt. It became a stilted, studied thing. I was consumed by doubt. The characters were not \"real\"; they were mouthpieces for various ideas, which shoved them around and kicked them to the ground. Andr\u00e9 Gide said something to the effect that the true novelist listens to his characters and watches how they behave, whereas the bad novelist simply constructs them and controls them. Without a doubt, I was constructing and controlling. </p> <p>Almost the one thing I didn't mind was that it was to be a love story. After all, what else is there? It's only half a life without love. And a novel would be surely nothing without it. The prospect of writing about love was even faintly appealing. It is one of those eternal themes that can be endlessly reworked. But every silver lining has a cloud; as I had feared it might, love was coming perilously close to denoting sex. </p> <p>Tiger was obsessively concerned with its place in the novel. Each day when I returned from the studio he would ask, \"Have we done the fucky-fucky yet?\" I counselled against it, as anyone in my place would have done, suggesting that discretion was the better part of ardour. But he pooh-poohed and said that a novel by him would be unimaginable without sex. </p> <p>\"Beloved, we need the jig-jig! Don't you see?\" </p> <p>He laughed and clapped his hands, willing me to share his enthusiasm. But I didn't see. I held out for a long time, pointing out that countless authors had believed they could \"do\" sex in a novel and had ended up falling into a terrible black hole. I reminded him of the Literary Review's Bad Sex Prize, awarded annually by Auberon Waugh, a friend of Tiger's and a man who had made it his mission to discourage the tasteless and perfunctory use of sexual description in the modern novel. Surely he agreed with Bron? I argued that sex in the novel was nearly always bad sex, and that it was best avoided. \"You are talking like a nun!\" he said. \"What's got into you? Trust me, Beloved, we will do the sex beautifully! It will be very distinguished.\" </p> <p>The literary treatment of sex is beset with vexed questions. First there is the problem of getting the characters to take their clothes off - buttons and zips and hooks can be so awkward, and you couldn't ever allow a man to keep his socks on. Then there are the body parts, which either have to be named (very unwise) or else replaced with dubious symbolism. And what about the verbs, the doing words? How can you choose to make people enter, writhe, thrash, smoulder, grind, merge, thrust - and still hope to salvage a smidgen of self-respect? The sound effects are even worse: squealing, screaming, the shriek of coitus. No, the English language does not lend itself to realistic descriptions of sex. We are too used to irony. What to do? What to do? Then, a sudden flash of brilliance, and I knew what to do. Tiger had an abhorrence of bodily fluids. His hatred of people who coughed or sniffed or spluttered was legendary. Provided that the sex scenes could be made sufficiently liquid, he might decide to abandon them altogether. Nil desperandum. Bodily fluids would be my deliverance. I set about my purpose with a devil-may-care recklessness. </p> <p>\"Strong and gentle as the waves, he swells and moves towards her like the sea to the shore. He dips and dives, eagerly but hesitantly, still fearing rebuff, until that moment of absolute clarification, when her ardour too is confirmed beyond doubt. Her lissom limbs quiver and enfold him into the sticky deliciousness of her sex.\" </p> <p>Of course, one thing led to another, and it was hard not to get carried away. Tiger, far from feeling squeamish, seemed relieved that at last the lovers had got down to the business. I pressed on, telling myself it was a means to an end. He would soon change his mind. Every new splash or splosh was a fresh hell. But still Tiger held out. There was no capitulation. In fact he was exultant. He opened a bottle of Chteau Margaux and we drank to sex. \"Bravo!\" he said - his highest accolade. This wasn't working out as planned. I would try one more act of sabotage. I had to make certain this time. Go for broke: </p> <p>\"They play with each other like wet seal pups, their bodies making succulent, slipping sounds. With his tongue he caresses her and spins a silver spider's web from the threads of her wetness. The pathway to heaven pouts like the calyx of a flower turned to the sun, the inner petals drenched in nectar. Her beautiful mound rises and falls as she rubs herself against his chin. </p> <p>\"As she trembles and gasps and comes, he feels a surge of happiness and an infusion, of supreme power. Her juices trickle down like a cluster of stars from the firmament. He can do anything now. He is God in one of his incarnations, spreading love and joy. Her amber thighs rear on either side like the waters parted for Moses. He rises and enters her.\" </p> <p>At least four things happened as a result of all this incontinence. Tiger was overjoyed; he raised my salary; the Sunday Times described the novel as \"a strong contender\" for the Literary Review's Bad Sex Prize; and my teenaged children were mortified. The novel was launched in the spring of 1995. It was a glittering occasion with all the usual suspects, beautiful creatures plucked from London's fashionable set. Tiger had a well-deserved reputation for throwing the best parties in town. Lots of glamour and glitz and permanent tans. People asked if I knew Tiger and if I had read his novel. On the whole, the critics were kind; there was scarcely any venom, and derision was reserved for the sex scenes. According to the TLS reviewer, \"It is only in these scenes that the author comes close to losing control of his spare, precise prose.\" The Sunday Telegraph reviewer wrote, \"I prefer to forget those brief, explicit embarrassments,\" while another review was entitled simply: \"Less sex please.\" </p> <p>This is an edited extract from Ghosting: A Memoir, by Jennie Erdal published by Canongate price \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Lucrezia Borgia: Life, Love and Death in Renaissance Italy</strong> <br>by Sarah Bradford <br>368pp, Penguin, \u00a325 </p> <p>It says something about the reputation of the Borgia family that when, one hot day in 1503, two of them went down with violent nausea, everyone immediately assumed that they had somehow managed to poison one another by mistake. In fact, on this occasion it looks as though Pope Alexander VI and his son Cesare may simply have been the victim of some bad seafood or a nasty bout of malaria, but the point was that, as far as the talking, writing, worrying classes of Renaissance Italy were concerned, the Borgias were a byword for the dark arts of realpolitik. </p> <p>No one's reputation has been damaged more by belonging to this first family of pantomime evil than Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander and sister of Cesare. Her casual reputation has been that of a murderous vamp who had only to sleep with someone before slipping something nasty into their post-coital wine. She was whispered to have had non-fraternal relations with her brother, which was the cause, 300 years later, of Lord Byron developing a perverse crush on her (he, too, was hazy about how far you could go with your own flesh and blood). Byron's thrill-seeking - he stole some of Lucrezia's golden hairs from a locket she had sent to her lover - was part of the 19th century's more general desire to turn Lucrezia into the embodiment of every kind of female transgression. By the time Victor Hugo and Donizetti had finished with her, Lucrezia Borgia could barely stand for the burden of evil that was slung around her fiendishly beautiful shoulders. </p> <p>Sarah Bradford's job, then, is to dust down Lucrezia and help us to see her for what she really was - a young woman (she died at 39) who was trying to play the best game she could with the uneven hand she had been dealt. The first dud card, of course, was the business of being born a girl, which meant that from the age of 13 she was being handed round like a parcel to suit her father's political game. Divorced at 17, remarried and widowed soon after (Cesare, her brother, stepped in to strangle the second husband), Lucrezia was 20 when she took up the job that was to be the making of her. As the wife of Alfonso d'Este, heir to the Duke of Ferrara, she became an accomplished stateswoman, deftly running a green and golden wedge of Adriatic Italy during her husband's many absences. </p> <p>Bradford's problem is that of all biographers working in the early modern period: the stories may be there, but the characters aren't. Personal letters, which to us are carriers of private thought and feeling, were to the Borgias public documents, to be dictated to scribes. Contemporary chron iclers, meanwhile, were interested in the what and where of the story rather than the why. Even those witnesses who wrote apparently for their own eyes, such as the diarist Johannes Burchard, the Pope's master of ceremonies, seem to have thought in terms of spectacular set pieces rather than deep structure. His account of the \"Chestnut Orgy\" in the Vatican - where naked courtesans scrabbled for chestnuts and prizes were offered to the man who could have sex with the most women - has probably done more to blacken Lucrezia's reputation than any other event. But did Lucrezia laugh at these ghastly sights, did she squirm, or turn away, or was she at the party simply for the dancing, which she loved? None of these Burchard sees fit to tell us, so neither, alas, can Bradford. </p> <p>In many places these public narratives deliver delicious detail, which Bradford makes the most of. One of Lucrezia's main duties as a Renaissance princess was to cut a bella figura wherever she went, sending a loud message about her menfolk's worth and status. Getting dressed was both a competitive sport and a political act, and the chroniclers linger with disbelieving pleasure over Lucrezia's cloak of crimson satin lined with ermine, or her sleeves of cloth of gold which hung to the floor. Even her mule would not appear in public without a wide cloth of mulberry velvet and a harness of beaten gold. </p> <p>The political background to Bradford's book is a cat's cradle of intrigue and quickly shifting alliances that requires you to keep your historical wits about you at all times. Whether the end result - the conclusion that Lucrezia was quite nice really - is sufficiently new or startling to justify keeping faith with nearly 400 dense pages of plotting is unclear. The problem does not lie in Bradford's treatment or research, which is immaculate, but is part of the larger problem of how to deal with biographical subjects who lived at a time when to be a sentient human being meant something very different from what it does today. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Kathryn Hughes is writing a biography of Mrs Beeton.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Naked Woman: A Study of the Female Body</strong><br> by Desmond Morris<br> 400pp, Cape, \u00a317.99<br> </p> <p>I wonder how many specimens Desmond Morris inspected before deciding that \"every woman has a beautiful body\", the statement which launches this book. Not enough, anyway, or he would surely have come across at least one that had gone wonky or started falling apart. He says our bodies are beautiful because they are \"the brilliant end-point of millions of years of evolution\". But you could say that about a slug. </p> <p>Still, the admiration evinced throughout Morris's \"guided tour of the female body\" will make a nice change for women who have come to detest their unwieldy carcasses for not resembling the bodies of unusually thin pubescent girls, and fear the consequences should they ever stop attempting to disguise the general wear and tear that men find so nauseating in our sex. With a lack of restraint that verges, occasionally, on the reckless, Morris rhapsodises everything that takes his fancy. Most memorably, hair, which stirs reflections on men's \"quest for the softly flowing locks they dream of caressing\". Even a woman whose hair or face is nothing to boast about may well be in possession of a working back, highly commended as \"a brilliantly assembled set of muscle and bones with the twin functions of body support and spinal-cord protection\". Other humdrum body parts are special, he points out, in being superior to the male equivalent. Female hands are singled out for praise, having \"far greater finesse when it comes to the delicate handling of small objects\". And, on looking down, one finds that one's hands are, in fact, rather nicely designed. Thank you Desmond. If only more men had your respect for the precision grip. </p> <p>It may seem a poor return for all these nice compliments, but beyond sharing his affection for body parts with which many of us are wearily familiar, it is not clear what Morris wants to say. Even his ardour occasionally grates. He does not consider the diseases that are apt to afflict the most brilliant end-point of evolution, nor does he notice the tedious, commonplace complaints that can leave the female body something less than beautiful. Feet, for instance, are all very well on the ends of our legs, but it seems pushing it, rather, to go on about how \"wonderfully they perform\", how uncomplainingly they \"effortlessly serve us and steer us through our changing environment\". Plainly, the man has never seen a bunion. </p> <p>But perhaps seen-it-all adult women are not the ideal tourists for this particular trip. Perhaps, as with Morris's celebrated The Naked Ape (1967), The Naked Woman's natural audience is composed of inquisitive adolescent boys. It certainly has a very promising bottom on the cover; though even the most eager schoolboy may be disappointed by the amount of space devoted to things like ears, noses and cheeks - and all the other bits of standard female equipment that are not, give or take a few hairs, really so different from his own. </p> <p>With breasts, bottoms and so forth, Morris is obviously on safer ground. If British sex education is in the sorry state indicated by our teenage pregnancy figures, then the more boys who learn the whereabouts of the U-spot and the elusive Anterior Fornix Erogenous Zone the better (a map or diagram would have been a bonus). The boys will also be intrigued - supposing it does not have a Ruskin-like effect on more delicate students - to discover the international variations in women's pubic hair. In the Far East, Morris discloses, \"the straight black head-hair is matched by pubic hair that has been described as 'black, short, straight and not thick but rather sparse ... forming a somewhat narrow triangle with apex upwards.'\" Young admirers of the Guinness Book of Records may also relish the many curious facts Morris has crammed into his appreciation. The merkin (pubic wig), inevitably, gets a look in. But did you know that there was once a French woman with \"no fewer than five pairs of fully lactating breasts\"? Or that in 15th-century Venice a law was passed requiring prostitutes to expose their breasts? No notes substantiate such easily forgotten asides, but nonetheless: just fancy. </p> <p>The Naked Woman abounds in these factoids; some interesting, some freakish, some dubious - many most amazing for the importance Morris attaches to them. We are familiar, of course, with the idea of cabinets of curiosities, collections of shells, bone, fossils. But one pictures this eminent zoologist with his Kinsey Report and Guinness Book of Records conveniently to hand, poring over sheafs of yellowed cuttings gathered over the years, carefully recording the fact that, in 2003, a woman with a tongue stud was struck by lightning in Corfu; or alighting on the story of another woman, in Connecticut, who attacked her unfaithful husband with her nails: \"The injured man required 24 stitches to close the wound in his scrotum.\" </p> <p>Not all Morris's anecdotes have been so laboriously collated. Once he has dealt, briskly enough, with the adaptive significance, physiology and function of a body part, most of his chapters rapidly decline into pages of loosely themed remarks that might look feeble if you found them in a child's project. Hairstyles, he notes, are not permanent.\"When the hair grows out, new styles can be tried.\" When it has grown, \"a ponytail can be a useful device to control untidy hair, both in the workplace and in the home.\" Musing on breasts, he notes that \"the combination of 'bra and panties' remains with us to this day as the favoured form of female underwear\". A lined forehead is \"a telltale sign that its owner is no longer young\". And so, some might say, is a book like this.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Defender </strong><br> by Alan Gibbons<br> 192pp, Orion, \u00a34.99 <br> </p> <p>How do you get a young reader to take the time to consider some of the larger political or social issues of the day? Surely books dealing with topics such as global warming or homelessness could seem like a huge turn-off for many teenagers? Writers of teen fiction have always known, however, that if it's all wrapped up within a well-paced, imaginative story they can get their readers to mull over perhaps more than they themselves realise at the time. Alan Gibbons is one such writer extremely skilled in this surreptitious art. </p> <p>Gibbons was once better known for his computer-game/ alternate-universe fantasy The Legendeer, but his recent work has been aimed very squarely at tackling some of today's more contentious issues: racism in Caught in the Crossfire, domestic abuse in The Edge, and the problems of political asylum in The Dark Beneath. Eschewing fantasy metaphors and sci-fi imaginings, however, these books have made their point right here, right now, reading like modern thrillers. His latest, The Defender, is an unflinching account of the impact of growing up in Belfast during the Troubles, coupled with a fight-and-flight chase through the suburbs of a quiet English town. </p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Ian Moore returns home early from school one day to discover two forbidding Irishmen waiting on his doorstep claiming to be friends of his father and attempting to inveigle their way into the house. Ian is suspicious, then terrified when he spots the gun one of them carries. He runs, and the breathless chase that follows - through back gardens, shopping malls and even high up on the wind-whipped outside ledge of a tower block - makes up more than half of the narrative. </p> <p>While on the run, Ian slowly unravels the mystery of who these men are. It's revealed that his father was once a member of the Loyal Ulster Defenders, that he even assassinated a republican ring-leader, but took the decision to get out of Belfast when his young wife was killed owing to his involvement. The gunmen are his one-time associates looking for reckoning. Ian has to confront the fact that his father has a past he could never have guessed at. The battle in his mind between his love of his father and the resentment he feels at being forced to live in ignorance is as intense as the chase itself. </p> <p>Interwoven throughout these chapters are vignettes from the father's youth, explaining his upbringing, trying to discover how and why he swore an oath of allegiance to the Young Defenders. It may be the chase that keeps the reader gripped, with its cleverly placed cliffhangers, but it's through the father's memories that Gibbons explores what he wants to say about those caught up in the conflict. </p> <p>Sides are never taken; there is no specific condemnation of who did what to whom, because Gibbons is more interested in exploring the outside forces that contrive to make someone make certain irrevocable choices. One conclusion is that the Troubles feed off themselves: \"Violence and retribution hung around the place like a pair of vultures.\" Twice we are told to remember, \"there's always a man behind the gun\". Ian's father's choices are made through pride in his beliefs, outrage at what he sees around him and peer pressure. </p> <p>At a time when many writers for young people are determined to play down \"issues\" in their fiction, Gibbons seems to relish hitting them head on. His thrillers are guaranteed to keep the reader flipping the pages, but also to make them tackle subjects they may initially have shied away from. The Defender sees him continuing to plough his controversial, distinctive and personal furrow. Long may he do so. </p> <p>Keith Gray's Creepers is published by Red Fox.</p>",
  "<p>The Safety of Objects, by AM Homes (Granta, \u00a36.99) </p> <p>Homes couldn't be more deliciously named: she kicks over the doll's house and gives suburbanity a good shake. This reprint of her first short-story collection (1990) shows her defining her territory and her mastery of the deadpan perverse. The first story seems to promise a retread of stale middle-class matrimony (\"She thinks she can actually see his hairline receding, follicle by follicle\"), until the couple slump together in front of a documentary on crack cocaine, and like the look of it. From then on, the brakes are off: Homes gives us a man enthralled by lawless mallrats, and a fat girl wondering if she can stop her windpipe with her own double chin. Middle managers go crazy when forced to step away from their routines; an adolescent boy fools around with Tropical Barbie (\"I came with a one-piece bathing suit, a brush and a ruffle\") and \"bump boy\" Ken. The only thing that is certain is that nothing here is hunky-dory. <strong> David Jays</strong> </p> <p><strong>Loot, by Nadine Gordimer (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>No one writes flintier than Gordimer. At her strongest, she refuses easy consolations, especially in the most substantial tales. In \"Mission Statement\", a white aid administrator begins a relationship with a reticent politician and with Africa itself, neither of them a comfortable bunk-up. Even the most fertile countryside is land-mined, until the administrator feels that \"green hand-grenades hung from the branches of the avocado tree\". Elsewhere, Gordimer imagines a crossover between the university and the homeless, or the bafflement of a middle-aged break-up: in each of these, the privileged gawp at upheaval as if for the first time. Although squinting hard at received pieties, Gordimer doesn't subject her own to the same scrutiny, and occasionally wraps herself in the prophet's mantle: in one story, an unborn foetus dreams of becoming a novelist; in another she asserts: \"but the writer knows something no one else knows; the sea-change of the imagination\". <strong> DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> Daughters, by Paule Marshall (Serpent's Tail, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Marshall's 1991 novel begins with an abortion, and Ursa trudges back to her apartment grimy with \"the blackened fallout from the city\". She holes up in New York, pushing around a stagnating thesis and an uptight lover, but avoids returning to the Caribbean island of Triunion where she grew up. It's clear that evasion isn't a long-term option, and that she'll have to deal with her politician father and his clamour of strong-natured women. Her father studied the American way, but the promise of radical change turns sour in Triunion and New Jersey alike, finally forcing Ursa's hand. Her mind throbs with exhortation, and the narrative weaves argumentative voices from Creole to Brooklyn, railing against do-nothings and suck-ups. Daughters wants to look to the future, but accumulates backstory in absorbing abundance: Marshall delays the gathering bad news and crises, and forgets to have a resolution until it's almost too late. <strong> DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> Charlie Johnson in the Flames, by Michael Ignatieff (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>Imagine, for a moment, you have a Harvard chair and run a centre for human rights policy. Though your books on the subject are based on visits to places where human rights have been grossly violated, such as Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, there is always a desk in the way. So you come up with an alter ego, Charlie Johnson, to turn abstract questions into concrete dilemmas. Charlie isn't a soldier, he's a TV journalist who's done the tour from Vietnam to Kosovo via Sierra Leone. No one can match Charlie for hard-boiled cynicism until his detachment is punctured by a woman, set on fire by a Serb goon, running into his arms. Ignatieff wants to be Graham Greene, but Charlie is a clich\u00e9 of an action man in a crisis. The writing is lazy, and Ignatieff shows an embarrassing admiration for the life of the macho war-junkie hack. <strong>Isobel Montgomery</strong> </p> <p><strong>Plain Truth, by Jodi Picoult (Flame, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>Here is a novel shouting to be turned into a film. Jodi Picoult covers all angles with a courtroom drama that puts a young Amish girl in the dock accused of infanticide and gives her a lawyer who is running scared of the complexities of modern relationships. The given is that everyone, except Katie Fisher, accepts she had a child. The questions are how did it die and how can Katie's cousin Ellie keep her out of prison? As a condition of Katie's bail, Ellie has to move in with the Fisher family on their farm, which is a bit of a pain when she wants to get her email, but a godsend when she has to work out how Katie thinks, and it gives her a chance to reflect on her own priorities. Picoult's compare-and-contrast between \"plain\" and \"englisch\" values of community and individuality is nicely done, but in the end Plain Truth is simply a detective yarn with light local colour. <strong> IM</strong> </p> <p><strong>Villa Incognito, by Tim Robbins (No Exit Press \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p>According to his publishers, Tom Robbins enjoys rock-star status in the States. Presumably this refers to the Frank Zappa/ Captain Beefheart template of rock stardom, as Robbins is one of those wilfully eccentric loose cannons whose work enlightens and irritates in equal measure. The opening section, a surreal parable written from the perspective of a southeast Asian badger, has a great opening line - \"It has been reported that Tanuki fell from the sky using his scrotum as a parachute\" - though the main part of the book centres on a group of American serviceman marooned in a remote Vietnamese village, who have not heard that the war has ended, and are reluctant to leave when they do. But the story is secondary to Robbins's incessant verbal riffing. Every page fizzes with such observations, but as with any overly effervescent substance, it tingles momentarily, you burp, then it's gone. Alfred Hickling</p>"
