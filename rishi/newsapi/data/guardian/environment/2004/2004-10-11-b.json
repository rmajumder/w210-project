  "The Iraq Survey Group has finally reached its conclusions on the search for weapons of mass destruction: Iraq did not have any, having destroyed its stockpiles years before the 2003 war. During the 18-month search by more than 1,000 ISG members, North Korea reprocessed plutonium which was previously safeguarded - apparently making half a dozen nuclear weapons. Iran built gaseous centrifuges and is, reportedly, now enriching uranium. <p>Not surprisingly, Tony Blair and Australia's John Howard say the Iraq war was still worthwhile. (They could hardly say otherwise.) The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, explained that, in spite of there being no WMD, the ISG report actually justified the invasion. It showed, he told an audience last week, that \"delay, defer, wait wasn't an option\". </p> <p>It is easy to dismiss Cheney's comments as the bravado of a candidate whose ticket is sinking over the mismanagement of Iraq. He seized on a portion of the report asserting that Saddam Hussein intended to reconstitute his WMD programme once sanctions were lifted. In effect, Cheney is arguing that the US was right to attack a country that posed no threat but whose leader had evil intent and one day might try to become a threat. </p> <p>In a June 2002 speech to the US army academy at West Point, President George Bush told the graduating cadets: \"If we wait for threats to fully materialise, we will have waited too long.\" This speech articulated what became known as the pre-emption doctrine. Nine months later, the US and Britain invaded Iraq to disarm Saddam's WMD. </p> <p>Although the case for invading Iraq depended on the threat from WMD, this single explanation did not make strategic sense in 2003. With the inspections regime that was in place on the eve of the war, Iraq could not have had a nuclear weapons programme. Building WMD requires large industrial facilities that could not have been hidden from intrusive inspections. </p> <p>Thus, on the eve of the war, the conceivable threat from Iraqi WMD consisted of previously manufactured chemical weapons that could have been hidden, and some possible production of hard-to-use biological weapons in mobile laboratories. Neither constituted a serious threat to well-equipped western forces, and neither actually existed. </p> <p>But the Bush doctrine is not just about forward defence. It also involves an American mission to spread freedom and democracy, particularly in the Islamic world. This theme is part of almost every Bush foreign policy speech. The Bush doctrine constitutes an ambitious combination of forward defence and nation building. The invasion of Iraq only makes sense in this context. </p> <p>Paul Wolfowitz and the Pentagon neo-conservatives, who are the ideological authors of the Bush doctrine, saw Iraq as an opportunity to transform the Middle East. They hoped that, by overthrowing Saddam, the US could establish a democratic Iraq which would have the same ripple effect on the Islamic world that the fall of the Berlin wall had on communism. Since the American people would never buy such an ambitious (and implausible) agenda, WMD became the justification for the war, but not its reason. Wolfowitz admitted as much when he told Vanity Fair that the administration had settled on Iraqi WMD as the single rationale for war for \"bureaucratic reasons\". </p> <p>The question is whether the Bush doctrine makes for sound national security strategy. Devising this strategy entails assessing threats and looking for opportunities. Since no country can do everything, the most important task of a strategist is to set priorities, taking into account available resources, costs and risks. In his West Point speech, Bush rightly identified the most serious danger as coming \"at the crossroads of radicalism and technology\". </p> <p>But Bush never prioritised. North Korea with nuclear weapons and Iran acquiring nuclear technology posed far greater threats in 2003 than an Iraq with some hidden chemical and biological weapons. The Clinton administration threatened war to get Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear programme in 1994. In 2002, the Bush administration noisily terminated the 1994 agreement because of North Korean cheating, and then did nothing when the country withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and began reprocessing previously safeguarded plutonium into nuclear weapons. All this took place before the start of the Iraq war, but the Bush administration never shifted its focus. North Korea is the world's leading exporter of missile technology to rogue states, and there is every reason to fear its nuclear weapons will be for sale. </p> <p>By not setting priorities, the Bush administration lost control of the costs and the risks of its strategy. The Pentagon neo-conservatives planning postwar Iraq had grand ideas for a long occupation (modelled on postwar Germany and Japan), but only sent a minimal number of troops (for domestic political reasons). Because of limited resources, they simply assumed a benign environment, eliminating from their planning the possibilities of resistance and lawlessness. </p> <p>Similarly, the administration hoped that Saddam's removal would intimidate Iran and North Korea, as well as encourage pro-democracy elements in Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia. They apparently never contemplated what might happen if the US got bogged down in Iraq. With nine out of 10 active duty army divisions in Iraq and Afghanistan - or preparing to go - North Korea and Iran understand that there is no spare US capacity to deal with them. And in the Middle East, it is surely the hardliners and the Islamists - and not the democrats - who feel emboldened by developments in Iraq. </p> <p>The Bush doctrine can be criticised on many grounds. Under international law, pre-emption is permitted (if ever) only in the case of imminent attack and not to deal with a hypothetical future threat. Bush's nation building has been ambitious, arrogant and incompetent. But the greatest flaw of the Bush doctrine is that it is poor strategy. </p> <p>By not distinguishing between serious immediate threats and distant potential ones, Bush ducked the hard choice at the core of all sound national security strategy - how to ration scarce military and diplomatic assets. As a result, the US invaded Iraq to eliminate a threat posed by non-existent weapons. As for North Korea and Iran, the US is reduced to hoping that others - China in the case of Pyongyang and the Europeans in the case of Tehran - can solve the problem. Hope is not a strategy. </p> <p>Peter W Galbraith, a former US ambassador to Croatia, is senior diplomatic fellow at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peterwgalbraith@hotmail.com\">peterwgalbraith@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "It's time to rewrite Kafka. It's not that he got it wrong, but he saw man - it didn't happen to women, apparently - going somewhere and being dragged into incomprehensible and dangerous labyrinths. Kafka will now show us man and woman not going anywhere. This time, K, or \"the traveller\", will simply sit within arm's reach of the phone and the computer and it's this fact alone that will drag the new K into the same labyrinth. <p>The new Kafka will write it like this: the phone will ring and it's Brian from British Gas. He's noticed that you get your electricity from British Gas. For a moment, you think this is his little opening gag, so you laugh. He doesn't laugh. You feel bad. </p> <p>He points out that he can offer you a reduction on a service that you don't actually have. You laugh again. Again, he doesn't. You feel worse. </p> <p>He says that it's maintenance. You won't have to do anything. He can simply put it into place with this phone call. Surely it'll cost? No, not for the first three months. A little thought crosses your mind: does that mean it'll cost something thereafter? </p> <p>But Brian from British Gas is still talking. He's on to another offer; like the first, this one will be discounted too: he can offer maintenance on your fridge. Your fridge has never gone wrong. You wonder why you would want maintenance on a fridge. You stop him. You say, what about when the three months come to an end? Yes, you will be charged, he says. You ask him if you will be told when the three months is up and your payments start? No. Will you ever know how much these will be or when the discount will stop saving you money? No, says Brian and adds quickly, so, I can take it that you want the service - it won't cost you anything at this stage. </p> <p>You're not sure. You say that you're not sure. So, he says, that's fine, he'll sign you up anyway and when you make up your mind, you can carry on, or not. Nice talking to you, he says. End of call. You have a sense that someone took your arm off without you noticing. </p> <p>You turn to your computer for light relief, only to find that the \"Anytime\" facility that you thought allowed you to access the internet at any time doesn't work. A screen comes up which explains that you've used up your allowed time under the \"Anytime\" arrangement. You find that a phrase you learned at university, \"a contradiction in terms\" keeps coming to mind. </p> <p>You push it to one side and go practical. You see that until the end of the month (one week away) you'll have to go to \"Pay per minute\". So for a week, you pay per minute. </p> <p>This all goes fine for a day or two until you have an out-of-this-world sense that when you've been switching off \"Pay per minute\" you are in fact still paying. It's something to do with the way in which you come home to your computer after a four-hour break to find that accessing the internet doesn't involve dialling again. </p> <p>You realise you've been paying per minute for the last four hours while you were in the park and the library and the post office with your three-year-old. </p> <p>So how do you disconnect Pay per minute? You run the cursor all over the screen, clicking on every icon you can find. The longer you look, the more you pay. You call your teenage son to the screen and demand that he helps you. He laughs, says that you're Ozzy Osbourne and goes back to bed with his girlfriend. </p> <p>When the month is up and you've paid for hundreds of minutes, you're back on \"Anytime\". Now, the old window that used to offer you \"Disconnect?\" doesn't appear. You roam round the screen all over again, enraged that a global conspiracy of Microsoft, BT and Yahoo are stealing your money. Your partner calls out helpfully: \"Kafka was right.\" </p> <p>You say, \"No he wasn't. I didn't go somewhere, like K, and try to get something. I just sat here and it got me. It didn't get me when I was in the park. It gets me here, indoors. That out-Franzes Kafka\" </p> <p>An image comes to mind of an octopus. One of its tentacles is sliding through an open window. Another one is coming up the plughole in the bath. In a panic, you ring pest control. A voice offers you seven alternatives. You choose number three. You are offered another four alternatives. You choose number one. Some music plays. It stops. A voice says that they value your custom. The music starts again. You fall asleep, not realising that you are lying on something that is eating you.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Sutherland will appear tomorrow</p>",
  "<p>The man who brought salmon and otters back to central Leeds has been honoured with the city's \"Oscar\" for civic commitment. </p> <p>Eric Cowin, 64, led a 10-year campaign to clean up the river Aire, which winds through the centre of Leeds and is now lined with expensive flats and offices. </p> <p>\"Only a decade ago, things were very different,\" said Kevin Grady of the Civic Trust at a lunch to mark the third Spirit of Leeds award. \"The Aire was one of the dirtiest rivers in the country. People would have laughed at the idea of anyone living beside it.\" </p> <p>The clean-up campaign involved public protest and quiet lobbying, with Mr Cowin using his contacts as a retired planner with Leeds city council to bring pressure groups and local authorities together. The tide turned in the late 1990s when the Environment Agency made the river its top national priority. </p> <p>Dr Grady said more than \u00a350m had been spent on ending pollution, bringing many times that sum back in terms of investment along the city centre riverbanks. Public support in Leeds had been encouraged by the fact that 70% of the sewage, the main cause of low water quality, came from neighbouring Bradford. </p> <p>Mr Cowin said he had been part of a team which included political leaders in the city. \"Politicians get a lot of stick, and they deserve our thanks when they take an issue seriously and get something done.\" </p> <p>Runner-up awards went to Freda Matthews, 72, whose community work in Little Woodhouse has brought the inner-city area more than \u00a31m investment and a Millennium green; and to the architect Ian Tod, designer of the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, Leeds College of Music, and the Yorkshire Dance Centre, whose annual seminars on design bring international architects to Leeds. </p> <p>Four hundred guests at the Queen's hotel were urged to press for \"exciting new architecture\" by the journalist and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter. She attacked \"sentimentalising\" over second-rate historic buildings in projects such as the BBC series Restoration.</p>",
  "Australia and Afghanistan don't have much in common, other than a vast, arid interior. But as voters in both countries cast their ballots over the weekend, their respective elections will have had an impact on political landscapes around the world. In the case of Afghanistan, the very fact of its holding democratic presidential elections is the most optimistic sign to come from that country for some time. Despite last-minute turmoil when 15 presidential rivals to the interim president, Hamid Karzai, called for a boycott over possible voting fraud, election observers declared the election to be fairly conducted. The sight of long queues patiently waiting outside polling stations on Saturday is some vindication of the international efforts to reconstruct Afghanistan, as is the absence of serious reprisals and violent attempts at disruption that had been threatened by supporters of the Taliban. <p>The long queues in Australia, meanwhile, were more a reflection of the country's legal requirement on its citizens to vote than a celebration of the flowering of democracy. John Howard's victory as leader of Australia's conservative coalition was a surprisingly strong one, after opinion polls had predicted a tight race. Instead, Mr Howard's coalition increased its majority in the lower house of parliament and looks likely to take control of the senate, making it the first time in 20 years that a government has dominated both houses. This will allow Mr Howard to push through unpopular measures on employment deregulation and loosening the country's media ownership laws in favour of global goliaths such as Rupert Murdoch's News International. </p> <p>Mr Howard's victory will be closely studied by the incumbents in Downing Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr Howard and his government had been a staunch member of the \"coalition of the willing\" that invaded Iraq last year, with Australia having 850 troops on the ground. The Labor opposition had boldly pledged to withdraw them by the end of the year, capitalising on winning support from those opposed to the war. But it is Australia's strong economy, with low unemployment and rising house prices, that appears to have had a greater influence on the election outcome. </p> <p>From the perspective of Tony Blair, the result is encouraging, a reminder that voters will choose domestic priorities over international affairs. The latest set of opinion polls bears this out, with Labour widening its lead over the Conservatives. Mr Blair's opponents would be unwise to rely on using Iraq as the sole fulcrum to lever him out of office.</p>",
  "<p>Millions of Beijing residents were warned to stay indoors at the weekend as a hazardous smog choked the city, closed highways and forced the cancellation of an air show for the visiting French president, Jacques Chirac. </p> <p>The haze, which is caused by low-grade petrol used in the city's rapidly increasing number of cars, was said to be as bad as at any time for several years despite measures to clean the air in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics. </p> <p>According to the World Bank, 16 of the planet's 20 most polluted cities are in China. Beijing is one of the worst, but, even by its appalling standards, yesterday was grim. </p> <p>Having built up for several windless days, the pollution reduced visibility in central areas to a few hundred metres, blurring the edges of buildings and turning distant skyscrapers into giant ghosts. </p> <p>To the embarrassment of the country's leaders an aerobatic display for Mr Chirac had to be called off. The Zhengyang Gate in Tiananmen Square, which had been illuminated red, white and blue in honour of the French leader, was also shrouded inmist. </p> <p>The meteorological bureau graded the air-quality as hazardous to human health - the third consecutive day in which the smog hit the worst ranking on the bureau's five point scale. </p> <p>The city's government advised residents not to go outside and ordered the partial closure of some highways. </p> <p>But busy construction sites and crowded pavements suggested few people had heeded the warnings. Beijingers are used to foul-tasting, sulphurous air. For weeks on end this summer, yellowish-white clouds blocked the sun. </p> <p>Newcomers, however, were shocked. \"It's just about the worst air I've ever breathed in my life. The sky looks really horrible,\" said Liu Ping, a 21-year-old waitress from Guangdong province. \"Everything feels and tastes dirty.\" </p> <p>This is a common story in China's cities, where factories and homes rely on low-grade coal for about 80% of their energy needs and environmental protection has long taken second place to economic growth. </p> <p>The health costs, however, are becoming apparent. Respiratory diseases are the leading cause of death in China. </p> <p>Doctors blame smog for sharp rises in cases of bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis and lung cancer. </p> <p>The air quality is supposed to have improved. In the past five years the Beijing government has spent 67bn yuan (\u00a34.5bn) relocating some of the dirtiest factories, tightening rules on sulphur emissions and introducing a fleet of electric and gas-fuelled buses. </p> <p>Just a few weeks ago state media were celebrating the 172nd \"clean air day\" of the year. </p> <p>Last year, they boasted, residents could \"enjoy\" breathing fresh air for almost two out of every three days - twice as many as in 1998. </p> <p>But the growth of traffic and the surge in global oil prices has undermined efforts to tackle the problem. </p> <p>Since 1998 traffic on Beijing's roads has doubled to 2m vehicles and it is expected there will be 3m by 2008. </p> <p>The new cars are burning some of the world's dirtiest fuel. Because of the increase in oil prices China is buying cheap \"sour crude\" on world markets. The oil is $1 cheaper a barrel, but contains far more sulphur - the main source of air pollution. </p> <p>According to the state environmental protection agency petrol accounts for 79% of the country's smog. </p> <p>\"The government should take further measures to prevent pollution at the source,\" Xinhua news agency quoted a Beijing environmental official, Shi Hanmin, as saying this week. </p> <p>Given the prestige of the Olympics, the city is expected to make every effort to ensure blue skies in 2008, even if that means closing down factories and forcing cars off the roads for the duration of the games. </p> <p>The authors of the newly published Olympic phrasebook are certainly anticipating drastic measures. Their language guide for officials and police officers makes no mention of smog, but includes the phrase: \"The sky is blue, the water is clear, and Beijing is becoming more and more beautiful.\"</p>",
  "<p>It has taken Norman Sherry 30 years to complete his three-volume biography of Graham Greene. When you meet him, you can understand why. The time allotted for our interview - at the very club where he first met his subject back in 1974 - is the standard hour. After that hour, he hasn't quite reached the climax of the story about his first meeting with Greene. This is going to be a three-volume interview.</p> <p>But what a story. Greene, who had liked Sherry's two books retracing the footsteps of Joseph Conrad, had approached him through an intermediary and asked him to come to the Savile Club in Mayfair. Greene turned up on Saturday morning, as arranged, ordered a drink - a black and tan, Guinness and Bass, Sherry remembers it well - and then announced: \"Professor Sherry, I do not like academics.\" </p> <p>\"I thought, bloody hell,\" says Sherry, \"he comes all the way from the south of France to tell me this. Then he said: 'I don't like intellectuals. Do you want to know why? I'll tell you - their only interest is from the Adam's apple upwards; they've forgotten the pants.' </p> <p>\"I didn't know how to answer him. I just nodded my head. I felt this was pointless. Then he said: 'If you wanted to go to Saigon, you couldn't get in now. You couldn't do what you did for Conrad.' His face dropped and he suddenly asked, 'Are you a Catholic?' I said, 'Yes'. His face absolutely dropped - he did not want a Catholic to write his biography because that would be prejudiced, he thought. I said, 'I'm lapsed', and his face lit up again. </p> <p>\"He suddenly said, 'Let's go for a walk' - with his long legs, I had to trot beside him; I couldn't keep up. We got to Pall Mall and cut up St James's Street. At the club, he had said, 'It can't be, then. I don't want anyone crawling over my life.' So why on earth had he come? But now he was being friendly. He was going to show me where he used to drink with Kim Philby. </p> <p>\"It was raining a little, that soft, mizzly rain you get here. He ran across the road, horns were pressing, there were black cabs like beetles everywhere, and one of them knocked him down. He was lying in the road - I remember water running up his trouser leg - but he wasn't hurt. He got up, hitched his pants, walked swiftly towards me and said, 'You almost lost your subject.' I said, 'That's not half as bad, Mr Greene, as losing your biographer.' We laughed, shook hands. It was on.\" </p> <p>A fateful meeting for Sherry, one that changed his life completely. Then, he was a little-known literary critic - books on Jane Austen, the Bront\u00ebs, and his Conradian explorations. He was head of the English department at Lancaster University and married to the novelist Sylvia Sherry. Decent Eng-lit semi-obscurity beckoned. In agreeing to write Greene's life, he did not realise that Greene would, even from the grave, be rewriting his. </p> <p>Critics, who have hated Sherry's concluding volume, have made great play of the game Greene was playing with his diminutive, vain (he has a wonderful thatch of dyed orange-brown hair), loquacious literary sleuth of a biographer. David Sexton, in the London Evening Standard, called it \"a satirical trick on a gigantic scale, Greene's last, best joke\". Greene's son and niece, who have been at war with Sherry since Graham's death in 1991, have likened the biographer to Inspector Clouseau, doggedly retracing his peripatetic subject's footsteps but misinterpreting everything. </p> <p>Greene had sent Sherry a huge map of the world with every place he had been underlined, and said to him, \"You tell me when I went there.\" Sherry, who knew little about Greene when they met and had read only two of his books, originally estimated that the biography would take him three years. Greene told him it would take \"20 and then some\". </p> <p>So was it a game? Is Greene laughing at his biographer from his Catholic heaven - or hell? \"I think he got very serious about me,\" says Sherry. \"He really did like my Conrad books. He thought, 'This is the kind of guy I need who is going to travel and see the places I've been to and the things I've done.' He knew I was a literary detective. It was a combat in that way, but we became close friends. He never doubted that I was the right person to do it.\" </p> <p>But, yes, he admits, there was an element of game-playing. \"Once,\" he says, \"I went to Capri, where Greene had a home, bought with the proceeds of The Third Man. It was a tiny house, everything white, with a tiny cross and a table and a bloody awful bed which I got a splinter into my hand just by touching. That was his happy home. He didn't need a lot of things. There were no photographs there, nothing. </p> <p>\"As far as I knew, he was not on the island. I was tired, I had just gone to sleep, I wasn't wearing any clothes because it was hot. Suddenly I woke up and saw the bedroom door closing. I got up, ran to the door, opened it and saw a man going out of the front door. The moon was very strong and I saw he was a big fellow. Next morning I went to see Countess Cerio, a member of an important family on Capri. I said, 'Is Graham on the island?' She said, 'Absolutely not, and I would know.' </p> <p>\"When Graham died, I went to the funeral and afterwards I was walking away and someone came up behind me and said, 'Norman' in a deep voice. It was the countess. She said, 'Would you come to my car with me, there's something I want to tell you.' I went to the car, got in and she said, 'I lied to you that time when you came and asked whether it was Graham. It was Graham. What he said to me was this: 'I'm going to call on Norman; I don't see why he should just be my doppelganger; I'm going to be his doppelganger.' \" </p> <p>Greene often used aliases, had several long-term mistresses, travelled incessantly, inhabited many lives. He also had a real-life doppelganger who for many years sustained the fiction that he was Greene. Sherry, a twin born in Newcastle to a fiery Irish father and a prim English mother, began Greene's life as a respectful biographer - it was three years before they were on first-name terms - but has ended it as part of the multi-layered Greene story. </p> <p>The critics loathe the fact that Sherry refuses to keep a distance from his material. The first picture in volume three shows him sitting on a donkey in Mexico. \"It was a joke - I was only on the donkey for 14 seconds. I travelled in a Jeep the rest of the time.\" He includes some of his own poetry, becomes emotional when he recounts Greene's death - Sherry, 69, appears to have a pathological fear of dying. It is all very unconventional, very unbiographical. \"Magnificent but mad,\" as one more understanding critic put it.</p> <p>Sherry has devoted 30 years of his life to Greene and has got a monumental pasting for his pains. How is he coping with the verdict of Ian Thomson in the Observer? \"For Norman Sherry to have begun so promisingly and ended so badly is a personal tragedy.\"</p> <p>\"Some of the reviews here have been shocking, a disgrace,\" he says. \"Thomson's was so bloody silly, saying it's full of purple prose. When you've spent all this time on it and you're kicked in the arse, that's no pleasure. It's no pleasure for anyone being kicked in the arse.\" </p> <p>He says the reception in the US has been more favourable. \"The review in the Publishers Weekly in America said it was magnificent. It's damned funny that I seem to get good reviews in America but not here. Maybe journalists here enjoy kicking arse. Some of the comments are just cheap and vulgar, nasty and unnecessary.\" </p> <p>Sherry blames Greene's family for poisoning the atmosphere. \"They say the reason I quote sexual things about Graham is that I have a tremendous desire for sex. That's balls. Not a single quote in that book belongs to me. Let's see if they can find it or if I've misquoted Greene. I haven't misquoted Greene. I think some of the stuff they've been saying is utterly shocking.\" </p> <p>Greene's son, Francis, is literary executor of the estate, but Graham wrote a brief note to Sherry on his deathbed giving him carte blanche to quote from his letters and diaries. \"I will have to protect you from my family,\" Greene had told him. The protection arrived three days after Greene's death. </p> <p>\"Two weeks after he died,\" recalls Sherry, \"I got a letter from Francis. He said, 'In future you will send every chapter that you write to me and I will decide whether I find it publishable.' I said, 'I will send you every chapter, but I think you should see this document that I received from your father on his dying day.' So I sent him a copy of it. Nothing could happen then.\" </p> <p>Since the publication of the first volume in 1989, Sherry has had to fight a war on a second front. Yvonne Cloetta, with whom Greene spent most of his last 30 years, loathed the book, angry that it portrayed an earlier mistress, Catherine Walston, as the love of his life. She refused to offer any further assistance to Sherry - an absence which he admits made writing the final volume difficult. Cloetta died in 2002, but Sherry is still bitter about her reaction. \"She said: 'You've betrayed me, you've betrayed Graham and you've betrayed your craft.' That hurt me more than anything.\" </p> <p>The literary journey that began at the Savile Club ended in a French restaurant called Bistro Vatel in San Antonio, Texas, at table eight, where Sherry has dinner alone each evening. I wish I could relate, in Sherry's own words, how sitting there he corrected the concluding chapter of his typescript, but his account would run to about 10,000 words, taking in the architecture of San Antonio, why no one walks in the US, why he only pays half price at the restaurant, why he enjoys working in a noisy environment, the recent loss of his top set of teeth (his dentist and periodontist are both thanked in the acknowledgments), the genealogy of M Vatel (originally Watel), and the sad fate of a famous forebear, chef to Louis XVI, who committed suicide because he felt one of the meals he served up for the king was inadequate. A tour de force of digressive genius. </p> <p>Sherry lives in Texas because Greene sent him there - his letters to his wife, Vivien, were housed at Trinity University in San Antonio. Sherry went to consult them, got a professorship, is still there two decades later. He also left his first wife - he still adores her, but he wanted children and she didn't - and married the woman who was helping him transcribe Greene's impenetrable handwriting. They had two children - his 13-year-old son, born in the year Greene died, has the middle name Graham - but have now separated. </p> <p>The urgency to have children was also, in part, due to Greene. Sherry's journeyings in the master's footsteps made him vividly conscious of his own mortality: he contracted gangrene of the intestine in Panama, tropical diabetes in Liberia, and went temporarily blind after a car accident in the UK. He was mugged in Liberia and his assailant jabbed a revolver into his right ear, causing him permanent ear damage. So worried was Greene about his biographer's capacity for catastrophe that he connived to block Sherry's proposed visit to a Congolese leper colony. Even during this stay at the sedate Savile Club, he has managed to fall down the stairs. </p> <p>At the end of our conversation, showing old-fashioned courtesy, he wants to escort me to Bond Street tube station. I politely decline and cross the road cautiously. As I look back, I see him stumble into a passer-by.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Life of Graham Greene: Volume Three (1955-91) is published by Jonathan Cape, price \u00a325</p>",
  "The European Union ended 11 years of sanctions against Libya today and eased its arms embargo as a reward for Tripoli giving up plans to develop weapons of mass destruction. <p>The move, which diplomats said was in accordance with a UN decision last year, reflected a significant warming of relations between Libya and the EU in recent months. </p> <p>Britain had been pushing for a complete normalisation of relations and a full lifting of the arms embargo, according to a senior British official in London, but the move was still hailed as a significant step.</p> <p>\"This is a turning point in relations with Libya,\" said the France's European affairs minister, Claudie Haignere.</p> <p>The EU, like the US, wants to improve relations with Libya now that it has scrapped its weapons programme. The Europeans are eager to invest in Libya's substantial oil reserves and obtain its cooperation in stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into Europe, notably by way of Italy. The move to improve relations with Libya follows last year's decision by the UN security council to lift 11-year sanctions against Tripoli. </p> <p>The EU also approved an Italian request to ease the EU's arms embargo imposed on Libya in 1986. This should allow Libya to buy high-tech equipment to prevent the flow of illegal African migrants through Libya into Europe.</p> <p>An EU \"technical mission\" is likely to visit Libya in November to assess Libya's need for equipment to monitor illegal migration. Italy wants to sell it equipment such as night-vision binoculars, but has not been able to do so because of the arms embargo.</p> <p>Washington lifted most of its commercial sanctions last April after Libyan leader Moammar Gadafy abandoned his banned weapons programmes. But trade restrictions, including an arms embargo, remain on the books. </p> <p>The UN sanctions were imposed in 1992 to force Tripoli to hand over two Libyans indicted for the 1988 bombing of an US airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. The security council suspended the sanctions after the two men were delivered for trial in 1999, and abolished them last year after Libya agreed to compensate the families of the Lockerbie victims as well as those of the 1989 bombing of a French airliner over Niger.</p> <p>As a sign of warming relations, Mr Gadafy went to the EU's Brussels headquarters in April on his first trip outside the Middle East or Africa in 15 years. The president of the European commission, Romano Prodi, has visited Libya several times to meet Mr Gadafy to discuss ways for Libya to sign up to an EU aid and trade pact it has with North African and Middle Eastern nations.</p> <p>To join up to that pact, Libya will have to sign declarations renouncing terrorism as well as committing to implement democratic reforms and respect human rights.</p>",
  "<p>Governments must work together to lift the \"cloak of anonymity\" that shields people who send email spam and prevent a loss of trust in legitimate e-commerce, experts said at a conference today.</p> <p>Representatives of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), speaking at the first international conference of email regulators, said law enforcement agencies must join forces to target the most prolific international spammers.</p> <p>They said the bulk of spam received by UK internet users originated from overseas - primarily from the US, China and Korea - making cross-border cooperation essential in tackling what is a vehicle for online fraud and computer viruses.</p> <p>\"We are all united by a common goal - to stop deceptive and fraudulent spam from flooding our email boxes, threatening our data security, and undermining email's effectiveness as a tool for commerce and communication,\" Deborah Majoras, the FTC chairwoman, said.</p> <p>\"Spammers hide behind the cloak of anonymity provided by the latest technology, and the path from a spammer to a consumer's inbox typically crosses one border, if not several.</p> <p>\"It's our biggest problem tracing the origin of spam, so providing information between countries on how to track them [spammers] down is imperative. In the cyber-speedy world of spam, it is essential that we move quickly to catch them.\"</p> <p>Bulk unsolicited email, commonly referred to as spam, accounts for more than 60% of all email traffic on the internet, and is linked to fraudulent, deceptive or pornographic activities. </p> <p>Today's so-called \"spam summit\", taking place in London, has brought together consumer and data protection officers and telecommunications executives from more than 20 countries.</p> <p>John Vickers, the OFT chairman, said spam deceit was a \"sophisticated criminal activity\" and posed a major threat to legitimate e-commerce.</p> <p>\"Our concern is the rising tide of unsolicited email coursing around the internet much of it laden with fraud, deception and viruses,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We are all familiar with the annoyance, invasion of privacy and cost that spam brings, but that is just part of the problem - spam is threatening the enormous potential for good that e-commerce, and the web generally, has opened up.</p> <p>\"Safeguarding that good, as well as combating the evil of the scams, is the challenge for us all. International collaboration by enforcement agencies, the efforts of the computer and communications industries and smart consumers at home, who take steps to protect themselves, are all needed to combat the spammers.\"</p> <p>According to Mr Vickers, one solution would be for internet service suppliers to charge for sending unwanted marketing emails, and another for workplaces to install spam filters. </p> <p>Richard Thomas, the UK's information commissioner, warned that spam was not just about email. \"We're coming across a hard core of UK spammers who are sending SMS text messages via mobile phones, or using faxes,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Thomas, whose job is to enforce the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act, called for increased powers to crack down on spammers.</p> <p>\"My powers are still not strong enough,\" he said. \"I'm seeking the power to get information from third parties who know what is going on. There is currently no obligation for internet service providers to provide information.</p> <p>\"The second is to ensure an injunction can be obtained rapidly when something comes to light - a fast-track solution so that, when we have got the evidence, we can go to court straight away.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is a tragic irony that, in his life and death, Christopher Reeve, who has died of heart failure aged 52, has been renowned for two roles: Superman, the supreme physical specimen, and a man paralysed from the neck down. Unfortunately, the second role was all too real.</p> <p>In 1995 Reeve, a keen rider, broke his neck when he was thrown from his horse during an equestrian competition in Virginia. But, after some years of therapy, despite pessimistic prognoses, he was determined to walk again, and became a symbol of hope for quadriplegics. \"I refuse to allow a disability to determine how I live my life. I don't mean to be reckless, but setting a goal that seems a bit daunting actually is very helpful toward recovery,\" Reeve said.</p> <p>In 2000, Reeve was able to move his index finger and breathe for longer and longer periods without a respirator. He also regained sensation in other parts of his body. Reeve dedicated much of his time and almost all of his energy lobbying US Congress for better insurance protection against catastrophic injury and giving support to stem cell research. Coincidentally, Senator John Kerry, in Friday's debate with George Bush, said that he believed embryonic stem cell research should be expanded, saying it would be the best way to give Reeve (an active Democrat) and others like him the chance to walk again. </p> <p>However, it would be a pity if this heroic and heartrending situation should obscure some of his many achievements in his acting career, cut short in such a cruel manner. After all, Reeve appeared in a total of 17 feature films, a dozen TV movies, and about 150 plays. </p> <p>Christopher Reeve was born in New York into an intellectual family; his father FD Reeve is a noted novelist, poet, and scholar of Russian literature; his mother, the journalist Barbara Johnson. During his childhood, Christopher was exposed to a stimulating intellectual environment that included Sunday dinners with the poets Robert Frost and Robert Penn Warren, and politician and academic Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The atmosphere was such that his father was disappointed to learn that the role of Superman that his son had been offered was not one in George Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman as he had thought. </p> <p>Christopher attended the exclusive Princeton Day School, where he started acting in plays. \"While I was growing up,\" Reeve recalled, \"I never once asked myself: 'Who am I?' or 'What am I doing?' Right from the beginning, the theatre was like home to me. It seemed to be what I did best. I never doubted that I belonged in it.\" After graduating from high school, Reeve toured the country as Celeste Holm's leading man in The Irregular Verb To Love. </p> <p>While at Cornell University, he majored in music theory and English, and spent time studying theatre in Britain and France. In London, he worked at the Old Vic. \"I was a glorified errand boy, but it was a very exciting time there. I helped by teaching the British actors to speak with an American accent. Then I went to Paris to work with the Comedie Francaise.\"</p> <p>In lieu of his final year at Cornell, Reeve was one of two students (Robin Williams was the other) who were accepted at New York's Juilliard School of Performing Arts. There he studied under the celebrated John Houseman. At the same time, he supported himself with a role in the long-running television soap, Love Of Life. Reeve's almost unreal handsome looks and athletic, six-foot-four frame made him perfect material for a soap-opera hero, as later for a comic-book one. In the meantime, he won a coveted role of Katharine Hepburn's grandson in Enid Bagnold's A Matter Of Gravity on Broadway in 1976, of which Reeve commented: \"I had the privilege of spending nine months working with one of the masters of the craft.\" In the same year, Reeve got a small part in Gray Lady Down, a submarine adventure film. </p> <p>While appearing in an off-Broadway production, Reeve successfully screen-tested for the 1978 movie Superman. It was the most inspired casting of an unknown in a series since Sean Connery's James Bond. Reeve portrayed Superman as \"somebody that, you know, you can invite home for dinner ... What makes Superman a hero is not that he has power, but that he has the wisdom and the maturity to use the power wisely. From an acting point of view, that's how I approached the part.\" Of playing Clark Kent, Reeve reckoned that \"there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character.\" Reeve, though he played the two roles straight without any sign of camp, revealed a deft Cary Grant-inspired comic timing.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the three sequels were a matter of diminishing returns and, after Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987), Reeve, determined to 'escape the cape', explained: \"Look, I've flown, I've become evil, loved, stopped and turned the world backward, I've faced my peers, I've befriended children and small animals and I've rescued cats from trees. What else is there left for Superman to do that hasn't been done?\" </p> <p>Away from the man of steel, Reeve portrayed a wide range of roles. His films included the love fantasy, Somewhere In Time (1980); the thriller Deathtrap (1982); Monsignor (1982), in which he again wore a cape in the title role; and two archetypal Merchant-Ivory period pieces, The Bostonians (1984) and The Remains Of The Day (1993). He also showed his ability at farce in Switching Channels (1988) and Noises Off (1992). Further proof of his versatility came on stage in The Aspern Papers in London with Vanessa Redgrave and Dame Wendy Hiller; Beaumarchais' The Marriage Of Figaro in New York, and Tennessee Williams's Summer And Smoke in Los Angeles, as well as touring in Love Letters. </p> <p>Before the near-fatal accident, Reeve seemed to have everything. He was an accomplished pianist and a superb athlete. He earned his pilot's licence in his early 20s and twice flew solo across the Atlantic in a small plane. He also flew gliders and was an expert sailor, scuba diver and skier. But horses were his great passion. </p> <p>In 1998, Reeve returned to acting in a remarkable TV movie update of the Hitchcock thriller Rear Window, in which a man confined to a wheelchair spies on people in a neighbouring apartment.</p> <p>Reeve is survived by three children, a son and daughter from his long relationship with modelling executive Gae Exton, and a son with Dana Morosini, whom he married in 1992. Reeve's parents are still alive. </p> <p>\u00cb Christopher Reeve, actor, born September 25 1952; died October 10 2004</p>",

  "Read the media and you'll be aware of a momentous political event taking place some way east of California. Over on the other coast something called the 2004 presidential election is happening. Swing voters are being courted, canvassers are knocking on doors, and suspicious-sounding 527 committees are piling money into local TV commercials. But out here on the west coast, where people are as passionate about their politics as anywhere else, the whole thing seems like a phoney war. Sure, there are petitioners on street corners and leafleters at farmers' markets, but where oh where are the real politicians? California needs to see more of middle-aged men kissing babies, it needs to see more secret servicemen wearing mirror shades, it needs more senseless ticketed photo ops dressed up as political rallies. <p>True, Bush and Kerry both visited Los Angeles in the summer, indeed in the same week, and they both put in an appearance in the spring, going to their rich friends' houses to ask for money. But compared to four years ago the attention paid to the nation's most populous state, the state with the largest economy in the union, the state that has given most money to the presidential candidates, has been pitiful. </p> <p>Four years ago, California was the centre of things presidential as the Democrats held their convention in Los Angeles. The candidates swung through the state, they even had their photo taken with the governor. But this time, no one is coming to the party. </p> <p>The main reason is that, without a convention to go to, national candidates figure that there is little to be gained from the long trek to the west coast. Californian voters, polling wisdom tells us, have made up their minds, and their minds are firmly Democrat. So the Kerry-Edwards team stays away, not wanting to waste money on the converted, while the Bush-Cheney camp prefers to focus on the swing states. After all, it's a long way from Florida to California. </p> <p>But California, according to the latest polls, is slightly more complicated than they imagine. For a start, the state mirrors the nation. The coast is liberal, the interior more conservative. The further you travel from the Pacific, the more Republican the voters become. Californians also tend to be classic third way voters, sticking to neither liberal nor conservative orthodoxies: they are liberal on social issues, such as gun control, abortion, the environment, but are fiscal conservatives, preferring deregulation, low taxes and small government.</p> <p>If you were to try to embody this confused political philosophy in one person, that figure might look something like Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. His recent flurry of decisions on bills passed by the state's legilsature have revealed him to be, well, unexpectedly liberal on some social issues - he is a Republican, after all - and convincingly conservative on others. So he has approved the distribution of clean hypodermic needles to people without prescription, toughened gun control and strengthened the rights of same-sex couples. But his conservative side has vetoed legislation promising an increase in the minimum wage, granting driving licences to undocumented immigrants and extending health insurance to cover maternity. Schwarzenegger has passed all of the tests set for him by the state's chamber of commerce, opposing all the legislation the chamber opposed and proving himself to be a reliable friend of car dealers, the pharmaceutical industry and big business in general.</p> <p>Of course, Governor Schwarzenegger is one explanation for the absence of the big players from California. His star wattage remains undimmed, despite the various political setbacks he has endured during the first 11 months of his mandate. No national politician in his right mind would be tempted by the prospect of sharing Arnold's spotlight in California. </p> <p>But Schwarzenegger is also one reason why it might make sense for the national players to come to California. His liberal credentials have earned him widespread support among Democrats and, if the state were ever to sway toward the Republicans, this might be the time. Recent polling suggests that the state may not be the shoo-in Democrats have for so long assumed. Three polls published in the last week send the sort of mixed message that can make George Bush so snippy. The Field Poll has Kerry leading Bush by 49-40, down from 53-41 in August, which in turn was down from a Kerry lead of 55-40 in May. But a survey by San Jose State University has Kerry ahead by just six points, at 48-42, down from his lead of 50-28 in July. And, just to confuse matters, the latest Rasmussen survey, covering the week to October 4, has Kerry ahead 53-40. </p> <p>Of course what will actually happen on November 2 is that John Kerry will win California, taking all its 55 electoral college votes with him and bearing out the decisions of the two campaigns not to bother with the state. Hopefully that result will lend weight to calls for reform of the winner-takes-all formula governing the presidential election. But don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "<p>The price of London Brent crude today passed through the $50 barrier for the first time as US oil futures also hit record highs.</p> <p>Brent crude reached $50.10 a barrel in morning trade on London's International Petroleum Exchange, the benchmark for Europe's imports of Middle Eastern, Russian and African crude. The figure was 39 cents up on the day, and almost $20 - or 65% - higher than at the start of the year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, US light, sweet crude oil futures hit a high of $53.48 a barrel, up 17 cents. Today's rises came as unions in Nigeria, which accounts for around 3% of the world's oil production, began a four-day general strike over fuel prices. The action follows a two-day oil unions strike at Shell last week, as well as threats from rebels to disrupt production.</p> <p>However, oil executives in the OPEC member country said there would not be an immediate impact on output.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, insisted the current price of oil was unjustified and should come down after next month's US presidential elections. \"There is no justification for it to be where it is,\" he said. \"This is a political year, and this may have some influence.\"</p> <p>Rapid growth in world oil demand this year, led by China, has eroded spare production capacity in OPEC nations, leaving the global market little scope to cope with disruptions. </p> <p>Mr al-Naimi added that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, could pump an extra 1.5m barrels per day if required. However, oil traders said extra supplies of the kingdom's high-sulphur crude would do little to stem rising prices. </p> <p>Industrialised nations lack the hi-tech refinery capacity needed to process OPEC's low-quality crude into transportation and heating fuels, and this has forced refiners to increase bids for higher quality supply from Africa and the North Sea. </p> <p>In the US, supplies remain disrupted by Hurricane Ivan, which hit offshore oil producers almost four weeks ago. Around 475,000 barrels per day of Gulf of Mexico oil production remain out of commission and, although one third of that production is likely to be resumed by the end of the month, operators say some output may be out until next year. </p> <p>US supplies were again disrupted by the weather over the weekend, with tropical storm Matthew forcing the closure of the Louisiana offshore oil port. The port unloads around 900,000 barrels per day of imported oil, and 500,000 barrels per day of oil from the Gulf Mars platform. </p> <p>The US treasury secretary, John Snow, said at the weekend that rising oil prices were \"creating headwinds for the otherwise very strong economy\".</p>",
  "<p>At least once a week, Julie would wake up and know from her husband's expression that it would be a battle to get out of the door and go to work. \"He couldn't deal with the fact that I earned more than him and he'd start shouting at me if he woke up feeling grouchy,\" she recalls. \"Once in a while, he'd hit me. If it was bad, I'd have to phone in sick. Over time, my boss got more and more fed up and eventually I was sacked. Then my husband hit me for not bringing any money in.\" </p> <p>Five years later, Julie is long free of her husband and she has a high-flying job as an office manager. She is understandably proud of the courage it took her to leave literally everything behind - that was the price she had to pay to start a new, safer life. But the one person she believes could have supported her more was her boss. \"I'd told her what was going on. At that time, she was the only person I'd told. But rather than providing any help, she made my life 10 times worse by getting rid of me.\" </p> <p>Julie's story is by no means unique. One in four women will suffer domestic violence, according to victims' charity Refuge, and many of them face the added burden of disciplinary action at work - the place they often feel to be their only safe haven. </p> <p>The Government believes it's high time employers offered greater support to people with personal problems like domestic violence, not just because they have a duty of care towards their employees, but because it's in their own interests. The Cost of Domestic Violence, a report by Professor Sylvia Walby at the University of Leeds, assesses the cost to the UK economy of time off work due to injuries inflicted on one partner by another at nearly \u00a33bn. </p> <p>In addition, domestic violence can influence an employee's morale, work performance and productivity, as well as their career development. \"In the worst-case scenario, the employer may even lose the victim to death. Two women are killed each week in the UK by their current or ex-partner,\" says Refuge's spokeswoman, Olivia Lamb. </p> <p>\"Of course my ability to do my job was affected,\" says Julie. \"I was living in fear. My mental health was a mess. But I really do believe that I had been working in a supportive environment, it wouldn't have been like that. In fact, my next employer was a major influence in me leaving my husband. She pointed me in the direction of proper help and made it clear that she would stand by me, even if things got bad.\" </p> <p>The reality is that very few companies have a policy on domestic violence and some people - including Dianah Worman, diversity adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) - believe that developing one is not the answer. \"It's not about policies or firms taking a parental role. HR couldn't broach the subject with someone,\" she says. </p> <p>Stephanie Klass, commercial law partner at Berg &amp; Co, solicitors, agrees that employers need to tread very carefully. \"I do think those who believe staff may be experiencing domestic violence should enquire as to whether that individual needs help, but I don't think they should voice their suspicions directly. And if such enquiries or offers of help are consistently refused, the employer must respect that decision,\" she says. </p> <p>The fact that domestic violence remains so hidden poses a major problem for employers, even if they do want to help, according to Rebecca Gill, policy officer on women's equality at the TUC. \"Many of the women we anonymously surveyed on the subject had lived with domestic violence for 20 to 25 years and had never told anybody,\" she says. \"In fact, the reason we did the survey was because trade unions were coming to us, saying that they were facing disciplinary cases on behalf of these women, but that they were reluctant to say why they'd been absent.\" </p> <p>But she insists that this is no excuse for employers avoiding the issue. \"They have a major role to play. We are not asking them to be counsellors, but to signpost women to where they can get help and put in place any procedures that could help. Just having a poster on the noticeboard with a phone number could save a life. Meanwhile, a large company could help a victim who does come forward about their abuse by offering a transfer to an office in another city, which could enable them to escape the violence and begin a new life. We know that financial dependence is a crucial part of the psychological abuse that a lot of these victims suffer.\" Others go much further. Domestic violence suffered by an employee at South Hams and West Devon Primary Care Trust prompted the trust to tackle the issue for all staff. Sue Behenna, then the HR manager, says benefits for employees suffering from abuse now include the provision of temporary mobile phones, special paid leave, financial loans and redeployment. \"It's often seen as a taboo, private subject that employers have no business to get involved in, but I felt that was wrong,\" she says. </p> <p>It's not only victims who have been receptive to the policy, she says. \"Many managers had unwittingly stumbled across the issue before and tried to help, but in hindsight realised they'd been clumsy. They appreciate the measured approach we now have.\" </p> <p>Nationwide building society has a policy that is particularly effective because victims don't have tell their employers about the violence to gain the support. Its emphasis on work-life balance, for example, allows people to take time off at short notice for short periods, without saying why. In addition, Nationwide provides a welfare fund with interest-free loans to help alleviate immediate financial problems, plus around-the-clock access to free and confidential counselling services. \"If people are happy at work, they'll do a good job and there are also benefits for us around staff loyalty,\" says spokesman Tim Hughes. </p> <p>Other employers are focusing on helping people not to become victims in the first place and some even help potential perpetrators to develop better ways of coping with stress. And companies that offer employee assistance programmes (external and general counselling and information services) are often helping victims without realising it. Kevin Friery, director of counselling at Right Corecare says he hears from many domestic violence victims. \"We recently had a case of someone who lived with a particularly nasty man and the only way she was going to be able to break away from the violent and drug-ridden relationship was to physically move away. We worked with her employer to get her redeployed.\" </p> <p>Domestic violence can exist in isolation but it is often linked with other issues like alcohol and drug addiction. \"That's one of the reasons I believe employers need to have policies around all these things,\" says Friery. \"They need to accept that all personal problems can spill into the workplace and that they should therefore have a role in providing support.\" </p> <p>As with domestic violence, though, few employers so far have taken this on board. In fact, many take a contrary approach, having followed the trend from the States of introducing random drink and drugs tests which, if positive, can lead to instant dismissal. Friery believes this is misguided. \"Testing should not be carried out unless the employer is prepared to take a sympathetic manner. The employee may be dependent - which is essentially an issue of ill health and should be treated as such,\" he explains. Especially, Friery points out, because it is more and more often stress in the workplace that causes an employee to turn to drink or drugs in the first place. </p> <p>Consequently, Right Core care is among a growing number of organisations involved in helping employers to formulate a firm but compassionate drink and drugs policy. \"In fact, many of the policies that work are similar to those in place for domestic violence - providing counselling and advice on where to get treatment, attempting to prevent the problem occurring in the first place and enabling staff to take time off to deal with their problem where necessary, as well as accepting that many employees may not want to admit to having a problem,\" says Friery. </p> <p>Alcohol Concern, which also helps employers create policies covering both alcohol and drug use, agrees this is the way forward. \"We too put the emphasis on rehabilitation rather than disciplinary procedures,\" says a spokesman. \"In fact, we encourage employers to create a culture in which staff who have a problem can come forward rather than being caught out in random testing.\" </p> <p>And this, believes Dianah Worman of the CIPD, is the approach that employers should take when it comes to all personal problems that affect their employees' working lives. \"Employers need to develop a climate of trust so people feel they can talk about it,\" she says. But if the Government, as well as many charities, get their way, employers of the future will have a far more intercessionary role than that and the boundary between home and work may become increasingly blurred. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The 24-hour National Domestic Violence freephone helpline: 0808 2000 247.

  "<p>* The good doctors of Oxford University have been labouring long and hard at the task which habitually stumps us lesser mortals - what sandwich filling should we choose before a business meeting, to ensure that we dazzle our superiors with our brilliantly innovative notions and commerical acumen, rather than distract them by our unwitting demonstration of how many spinach strands and/or poppy seeds one post-prandial mouth can hold. </p> <p>The answer, my friends, is (and if you could insert your own drum roll here, I would be most grateful): the chicken tikka masala sandwich with mango salsa. Apparently the chicken furnishes a plethora of vital vitamins and mineral that combat tiredness and its protein-rich flesh encourages the brain to spew forth neurotransmitters that help a body stay bright and perky even as a procession of people pass before you, intent on dulling your sparkling eyes with their Powerpoint presentations, flowcharts and all the other ills that corporate flesh is heir to. I'm not sure what the mango salsa does - I suspect that it is there solely by virtue of its lubricant powers, without which the fricative properties of chicken tikka masala have been known to result in fatal oesophageal blockage, aka you choking to death at your desk. </p> <p>If you are thinking of taking some exercise, make sure you partake of an apple and peanut butter combo on granary bread, thereby ensuring the necessary quantities of protein (for muscle-building), B vitamins (for releasing energy from food) and fruit for, erm, pulmonary freshness. According to Chinese medicine, apples have a cooling effect on the lungs. Particularly if you freeze them, then strap them to your torso, of course. </p> <p>Perhaps more vitally, the biochemists have also discerned which filling can best fend off a hangover: chocolate banana. The one helps restore blood sugar levels and the other is stuffed full of vitamin B6 which is essential to serotonin production which in turn is essential to improving one's mood. It could be the only sandwich standing between you and a line manager meltdown. </p> <p>* Are you skipping round the office as we speak, singing the praises of your company chairman and planning what to do with the windfall he has authorised for all his employees? No? Then you probably don't work for Saga boss Roger De Haan who this week announced that his staff will receive a \u00a31,000 bonus for every year of service they have under their belts, from the proceeds of a \u00a31.35bn management buyout. One lucky couple are set to pocket \u00a350,000 between them. Another employee, who will take home an extra \u00a37,000, said, \"It's wonderful, but so typical of Roger De Haan to think of his staff and customers, he is a really lovely man.\" All of a sudden my own employer's largesse - all the Post-its I can steal - doesn't seem quite the attraction it once did. </p> <p>* De Haan becomes even more of a wonder to behold with the news from Income Data Services that the 1,000 top executives in the FTSE 100 companies were awarded average pay rises last year of 16.1%. That's about \u00a376,000 in real money, and compares unhappily (for the vast majority of the working population anyway) with the average employee's pay rise in 2003, which amounted to just 3.8% - or \u00a3906. </p> <p>Or you could look at it another way, as the TUC did, and see that it would take the average employee (with a salary of \u00a324,741) 22 years to earn the annual wage of the fattest of cats - \u00a3550,000. Still, it's nice to see that at least one biblical edict is still being adhered to even in these largely secular times: truly, to those that have shall be given more. </p> <p>*How about another instalment of the occasional series Statistics I Have Loved, Known or Admired?

  "<p>The troubled supermarket giant J Sainsbury today issued its third profits warning of the year.</p> <p>Sainsbury's released what it called a \"clarification statement\" to the Stock Exchange, with the move following \"recent analyst and press comment\". </p> <p>It said underlying pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year would be between \u00a3125m and \u00a3135m, well below City forecasts. Last year, the supermarket chain made interim profits of \u00a3366m.</p> <p>Reports claimed Sainsbury's briefed a Merrill Lynch analyst on Friday to point out that, despite a cut last week, the US bank's profits forecast for the group remained too high. The briefing reportedly led Merrill, the house broker to Tesco, to slash its \u00a3177m half-year forecast by a further 10%.</p> <p>A Sainsbury's spokeswoman today admitted that the Financial Services Authority - which was apparently concerned about potential selective disclosure of information - had contacted the company, but insisted the decision to make the clarification statement had been taken independently.</p> <p>Sainsbury's issued its first profits warning in March, when it blamed ongoing restructuring and said price competition in the wake of Morrisons' takeover of Safeway had made the trading environment much tougher.</p> <p>That was followed by a further warning in July, when the company said underlying profit before tax for the current financial year would be \"significantly below consensus market forecasts, with the majority of the impact expected in the first half\". </p> <p>Today's update also said the group was not in a position to give any guidance on full year forecasts until October 19, when it will present the conclusions of its full business review. </p> <p>Richard Ratner, a retail analyst at broker Seymour Pierce, said he expected Sainsbury's to post full year underlying profits of between \u00a3240m and \u00a3250m, compared to last year's \u00a3675m. \"They are massively uncompetitive,\" he said. \"They have got their non-food offering all wrong.\"</p> <p>At next week's review presentation, Justin King, the new chief executive, is expected to slash the annual dividend from its current 15.7p to a level that could be as low as 7p.

  "<p>The majority of newly built houses in London, the south-east and the east of England are no better than average, according to a survey published today by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. </p> <p>The report reveals that from a sample of 100 recently constructed developments in the region, 17% were judged to be \"good\" or \"very good\". With 61% considered \"average\", that leaves 22% in the \"poor\" category. </p> <p>Housing was judged on character; its integration with the road system, parking and pedestrianisation; design and construction; and environment and community. </p> <p>The ratings come as 1m new homes are being planned throughout London and the south-east by 2016. </p> <p>Commenting on the report, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said: \"Quality is as important as quantity in creating sustainable communities that will stand the test of time.

Several have schemes in both the top and bottom percentages. Housebuilders St James, for example, scored impressive marks for a development in Islington, north London, which succeeds in weaving a listed building, existing trees, new buildings and affordable housing into one coherent scheme which provides a density of 378 rooms a hectare. But it is also present at the bottom of the table, scoring poorly for a development in Enfield, north London, which was criticised for its road system and lack of attempt to design in any character or sense of place. </p> <p>Richard Simmons, the chief executive of the CABE, said the worst projects were due to a \"combination of undemanding planners and lazy developers\", as well as undemanding customers. A further CABE initiative has been to publish a guide on what to look for when buying a new home. </p> <p>The report also criticises the application of \"a generic 'vernacular' architecture, often unrelated to local building styles or materials\". It added: \"The effect has been to make new residential areas relatively indistinguishable form each other, without a true sense of place.\" </p> <p>Lessons may have been learnt from the building disasters of the 1960s and 70s - the towerblocks that nobody wants, the poor standards of construction and soulless estates. </p> <p>\"Local authorities need to say, 'It's not good enough',\" Mr Simmons said. \"And the different groups of professionals need to understand each other's skills better.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We're not talking about taste here. We're talking about buildings and communities that suit people, where they will want to live. </p> <p>\"But volume home builders should be interested in quality.

  "Virtually every area of humanistic scholarship and artistic activity in the latter part of the 20th century felt the influence of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, who has died aged 74 from pancreatic cancer. <p>\"Deconstruction\", the word he transformed from a rare French term to a common expression in many languages, became part of the vocabulary not only of philosophers and literary theorists but also of architects, theologians, artists, political theorists, educationists, music critics, filmmakers, lawyers and historians. Resistance to his thinking, too, was widespread and sometimes bitter, as it challenged academic norms and, sometimes, common sense. </p> <p>Derrida's name has probably been mentioned more frequently in books, journals, lectures, and common-room conversations during the last 30 years than that of any other living thinker. He was the subject of films, cartoons and at least one rock song, by Scritti Politi; he generated both adulatory and vituperative journalism; and he wrote some of the most formidably difficult philosophical works of his time. If he is remembered in future centuries, it is likely to be for contributions to our understanding of language, meaning, identity, ethical decisions and aesthetic values. </p> <p>Derrida's starting point was his rejection of a common model of knowledge and language, according to which understanding something requires acquaintance with its meaning, ideally a kind of acquaintance in which this meaning is directly present to consciousness. For him, this model involved \"the myth of presence\", the supposition that we gain our best understanding of something when it - and it alone - is present to consciousness. </p> <p>He argued that understanding something requires a grasp of the ways in which it relates to other things, and a capacity to recognise it on other occasions and in different contexts - which can never be exhaustively predicted. He coined the term \"differance\" ( diff\u00e9rance in French, combining the meanings of difference and deferral) to characterise these aspects of understanding, and proposed that differance is the ur-phenomenon lying at the heart of language and thought, at work in all meaningful activities in a necessarily elusive and provisional way. </p> <p>The demonstration that this is so largely constituted the work of deconstruction, in which writers who laid claim to purity or transparency or universality - and this would include most of the significant figures in the philosophical tradition - could be shown, by close and careful reading, to be undoing those very claims in the act of making them by their implicit recognition of the ongoing work of differance. </p> <p>For example, in an early work on the German phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne (Speech And Phenomena, 1967), Derrida argued that the philosophical emphasis on the \"living present\" concealed a dependence on the idea of death: I cannot use a sign - a word or a sentence, say - without implying that it pre-exists me and will outlive me. \"I am\" means \"I am mortal.\" </p> <p>These readings were not done in a spirit of one-upmanship or negative criticism; Derrida claimed to love everything he deconstructed. For him, it was a mark of the greatness of Plato, Rousseau, Hegel or the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas that their texts moved beyond what they straightforwardly asserted. This affirmative attitude became particularly visible when he was discussing literary works, where he often found vivid enactments of his arguments. </p> <p>Derrida moved easily among French, English and German writers, and his favourites included James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Paul Celan. Although his name is often coupled with the term \"postmodernism\" (sometimes with a suggestion of moral relativism), his allegiance was much more to the strenuous aesthetic experiments of the modernist writers. For him, the fact that moral values cannot be expressed as simple rules of conduct increased, rather than decreased, the importance of our ethical responsibilities. </p> <p>The warmest reception of his work occurred in university literature departments, where it was frequently studied alongside the writing of other poststructuralists, notably Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous. </p> <p>Derrida's style was as upsetting to traditional philosophers as were his arguments. This was an important element of his famous debate in the 1970s with the American philosopher John Searle concerning the significance of JL Austin's speech-act theory, which attempted to distinguish between different kinds of utterance. While praising Austin, Derrida criticised him for giving too much priority to \"serious\" uses of language, and not recognising the importance of the ways in which the same speech-acts are used in humour, play-acting, teaching, citation and on other \"non-serious\" occasions. </p> <p>Searle criticised Derrida for misrepresenting Austin (which in some respects he did), but the American, not appreciating the function of Derrida's playful style, equally misrepresented the Frenchman, who responded by writing an even more outrageous rejoinder. What might have been a valuable dialogue between Derrida and analytical philosophy of language led nowhere. </p> <p>In fact, Derrida had several styles, ranging from the technical analysis of Greek terminology, through highly personal meditations to an exuberant sporting with language. He could be a highly comic writer - and an equally comic speaker, with an impeccable sense of timing - even when the issues were of the utmost gravity. This affront to convention was not born of a desire to shock; it was part of a strategy of undermining the categories - including the distinction between the serious and the non-serious - that had long dominated philosophical language. (Exceptions, such as Nietzsche, were given due credit.) Derrida's writing is strange and difficult because it has to be: to test the limits of what can be thought is to test the limits of what can be articulated. </p> <p>Imitations of the Derridean style seldom succeed, and it is not surprising that a caricature version of Derrida emerged. But this flamboyantly self-regarding figure, dismissing the search for truth, declaring historical knowledge to be impossible, denying that there is anything beyond language - and doing all this in a relentless series of puns and neologisms - bore no resemblance to the person himself. He was a cautious thinker, frequently pointing out the unavoidable simplifications in what he was saying; he always insisted on philosophical and linguistic rigour (even if his understanding of what constituted rigour differed from the traditional one); and he respected truth and historical accuracy in a very traditional manner. </p> <p>He was a man of remarkable modesty and generosity, quite without self-importance. Anyone who attended one of the many conferences dedicated to his work observed how conscientiously he listened to every paper (whether by a famous thinker or a graduate student), took careful notes, and asked polite but searching questions. Unknown academics sending manuscripts would receive handwritten (which sometimes meant virtually undecipherable) comments in response, always written in a positive spirit. </p> <p>Jackie Derrida - he later adopted a more \"correct\" French version of his first name - was born in El-Biar, near Algiers, into an indigenous Jewish family. He attended local primary schools and, in 1941, entered the nearby lyc\u00e9e, already subject to anti-semitic Vichy laws. The following year, he was expelled as a Jew, and was not able to recommence regular schooling until 1944. Even then, he did not settle down; he dreamed of being a professional footballer and failed the baccalaur\u00e9at in 1947. These were years of intense reading, however, including Rousseau, Nietzsche and Paul Val\u00e9ry. </p> <p>Moving through two more lyc\u00e9es in Algiers, Derrida was introduced to the two great precursors in 20th-century French philosophy, with whom, oddly perhaps, he never engaged at any length in print, Bergson and Sartre; he was more taken by his discovery of Kierkegaard and Heidegger. He passed the bac in 1948 and set his sights, thanks to a chance radio programme, on the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, the leading French institute for literature and philosophy. </p> <p>The route lay via two years of preparatory classes at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-grand in Paris, although it took Derrida longer than this as he suffered physically and psychologically in the new environment (it was the first time he had been out of Algeria). At his third attempt, in 1952, he was admitted to the \u00c9cole Normale, where, after faltering again, he finally passed the agr\u00e9gation in 1956. He also made some important friends, including Louis Althusser, Foucault and the psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier, whom he married in 1957. </p> <p>After a year's visit to Harvard University and a spell of military service, Derrida took his first teaching job, at a lyc\u00e9e in Le Mans. He then taught at the Sorbonne for four years, before moving to the position he was to occupy until 1984: mitre-assistant at the \u00c9cole Normale. There, his seminars - written every year on a fresh topic - became Parisian institutions. His first publication (1962) was a very long introduction to his translation of a short essay by Husserl on The Origin Of Geometry. It is striking that, despite the mathematical subject-matter of this work, Derrida confidently set out in it many of the themes that were to recur later, including his conception of differance. </p> <p>The event that projected him into the international limelight was a conference at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1966, where the relatively unknown (but incontrovertibly glamorous) young philosopher upstaged the likes of Lacan and Jean Hyppolite. This was to be the start of a long relationship with English departments in the US, where he was made more welcome than anywhere else in the world. (The French academic establishment never took him to its heart, and academic philosophers everywhere were generally uncomprehending.) </p> <p>Derrida's annus mirabilis was 1967, which saw the publication of three extraordinary books. For philosophers, it is in La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne that Derrida makes, or fails to make, his case, arguing through a careful critical reading of another text by Husserl, for the fundamental role of differance in language and thought. </p> <p>In L'Ecriture et la diff\u00e9rence (Writing And Difference), he brought together essays in which he began to develop his position in the context of debates about psychoanalysis, the human sciences and ethics. But it was De la grammatologie (Of Grammatology) that created the greatest stir. After an introductory discussion in which he argued that \"grammatology\", the theory of written signs, can point the way to an understanding of language freed from the myth of presence and open to the work of differance, he entered upon a brilliant deconstruction of the accounts of language given by Saussure, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Rousseau and others. </p> <p>Derrida gives most attention to Rousseau, and connects the priority Rousseau gives to speech over writing with the priority he gives to nature over culture, to melody over harmony, and to coitus over masturbation. Derrida noted that, in each case, Rousseau uses the word \"supplement\" to designate the relationship between the second term and the first. The word suggests that the second term is inessential, merely adding to the first term, which is primary, full, self-sufficient. </p> <p>Yet a secondary meaning of the word \"supplement\" seemed to Derrida to be playing around all Rousseau's uses of it: as the supplement to a dictionary supplies its missing terms, so writing, culture, harmony and masturbation all make up for deficiencies in what was supposed to be the perfect and complete entity to which they are in an ancillary relation. </p> <p>The second entity, not quite under the author's control, comes to set the terms which make possible the first entity. \"Supplementarity\", thus understood, is a manifestation of differance; and other manifestations are explored in Derrida's discussions of the Greek terms pharmakon (both medicine and poison) and hymen (both separation and marriage) in his next major work La Diss\u00e9mination (Dissemination, 1972). </p> <p>Although Derrida was active in the protests of 1968, he had reservations about the allegiance to the Communist party of many of his associates. In 1974, he founded the Groupe De Recherche Sur L'enseignement Philoso- phique, dedicated to improving the teaching of philosophy in schools. By now, he was receiving invitations from many institutions, and important friendships were established on these travels. The American connection blossomed in the 1970s, when he began an annual visit to Johns Hopkins and then to Yale, where he worked closely with J Hillis Miller and Paul de Man (the kernel of what came to be known as the Yale school of deconstruction). </p> <p>In 1980, Derrida defended a doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne, based on his publications, and, that same year, he was the focus of a 10-day Cerisy-la-Salle conference organised by two friends whose work was to remain in close touch with his, Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. The following year, there took place an event that was to haunt him for the rest of his life: returning from a clandestine seminar in Prague, he was arrested on false drugs charges and imprisoned. His release was secured after a protest by the French government. </p> <p>In order to encourage developments in philosophy outside the traditional canons, Derrida contributed to the establishment of the Coll\u00e8ge International de Philosophie, of which he became the first director in 1983. That same year, he also participated in the creation of an anti-apartheid foundation and a writers' committee for Nelson Mandela. In 1984, he was elected to the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales as director of studies. As at the \u00c9cole Normale, he gave an annual seminar, keeping it up after retirement in 1998, although with fewer sessions. </p> <p>His friend Hillis Miller moved from Yale to the University of Irvine, California, in 1986, and Derrida switched allegiance at the same time, beginning an annual spring visitthat continued until 2003. He also began a regular short autumn visit to New York, as the guest of New York University, the New School and the Cardozo School of Law. </p> <p>The discovery, in 1987, of his friend de Man's collaborationist wartime journalism was a personal blow to Derrida. At the Alabama University conference at which the articles were made public, he gave an extraordinarily moving speech expressing the complex emotions provoked by the disclosure. Around the same time, more evidence about Heidegger's involvement with the Nazi party emerged, and Derrida was obliged to make it clear that, although he owed more to Heidegger than to any other philosopher, his adherence was far from uncritical. </p> <p>Derrida's honorary Cambridge degree, awarded in 1992, provoked a fierce debate and an outbreak of caricaturing, as well as spirited defences. In the early part of his career, he did not allow photographs of himself to be published, but such a simplistic opposition between the public and the private could not survive his philosophical scrutiny, and soon his image became familiar. The 2002 film Jacques Derrida, by Amy Ziering Kofman, entertainingly explored this questionable opposition, and gave a wider glimpse of its subject's wicked sense of humour. </p> <p> D errida published some 70 books and countless articles. The most important volumes include Glas (1974), which staged a confrontation between Hegel and Genet by means of an ingenious page-layout; La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en peinture (The Truth In Painting, 1978), on visual art and attempts to theorise about it; La carte postale (The Post Card, 1987), an exploration of psychoanalytic themes through a fictional series of postcards to an unidentified addressee; and two large-scale collections of essays, Psych\u00e9: inventions de l'autre (1987), on a wide range of topics, and Du droit \u00e0 la philosophie (1990), in which the institutional situation of philosophy is addressed. </p> <p>In 1993 Derrida's longstanding admiration for Marx was given full elaboration in a controversial study, Spectres de Marx (Spectres Of Marx). Always a man of the left, he felt able to write this book only when Soviet communism had collapsed, as his espousal of Marx was then, he said, less likely to be misunderstood. </p> <p>Derrida's later writings were increasingly concerned with ethical and political issues, including religion (both Judaism and Christianity), the question of capital punishment (to which he was vigorously opposed), and the place of animals in the tradition of western philosophy. </p> <p>He and Marguerite continued to live happily in an unpretentious house in an unremarkable Parisian suburb. But he was a man with many anxieties, and death was a constant preoccupation, both philosophically and personally. Over the years, he delivered a series of moving eulogies, a collection of which was published in 2001 as The Work Of Mourning, but whose French title is even more apt: Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde (Each time unique, the end of the world). </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and their sons Pierre and Jean, and a son, Daniel, by the philosopher Sylviane Agacinski. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Jacques (Jackie) Derrida, philosopher, born July 15 1930; died October 8 2004</p>",
  "<p>Rachel Roxburgh has a strange job title: head of running. Does this mean she runs around a lot? Or does she run things, or perhaps check whether machinery is running properly? </p> <p>In fact, Roxburgh is head of running at Cancer Research UK because she organises the spectacular fun runs that have seen a phenomenal 400,000 women participate in the charity's Race for Life events in this year alone, raising \u00a325m between them. </p> <p>The running operation is part of the National Events department at Cancer Research, Britain's biggest charity. Now Roxburgh - who also organises sponsored treks in such destinations as the Great Wall of China and Mount Kilimanjaro - is organising 10km runs for men and women in the grounds of Leeds Castle, Blenheim Palace and other stately homes. </p> <p>Roxburgh says: \"We reach out to a huge audience. It's very exciting and dynamic.\" Her team handles everything from finding and setting up the venues for the runs to thinking about the PR and marketing aspects - how the event will get the charity's message across. </p> <p>Roxburgh has worked for Cancer Research for the past 11 years. She fell into this field after a work placement at Help the Aged's special events department uncovered a side to fundraising she had never imagined. \"I had a standard idea of what charities were like: coffee mornings, twinsets and pearls,\" she says. \"But I was at film premieres. Princess Diana was our patron and I met her four times.\" </p> <p>Now, she says, one of the rewards of the job is meeting the supporters whose efforts raise such a lot of cash. She was there to greet cancer survivor Findlay Young as he completed the last of four gruelling half-marathons in 24 hours. \"Just seeing his expression as he was running towards the finishing line was the most extraordinary moment for me - tears streaming down his face and arms outstretched,\" she recalls. </p> <p>It is this link between the amazing contribution of volunteers such as Young and professionals such as Roxburgh that is crucial, says Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of the Institute of Fundraising. \"The thing that is really unique about the profession is its main public face is a vast army of volunteers, who are underpinned by a smaller professional, dedicated and sophisticated corps of employed individuals,\" he says. </p> <p>The professionals have a wide range of skills from marketing expertise to the ability to recognise the skills and attributes of others and work out who is best placed to \"do the ask\" - actually requesting donations. </p> <p>Lots of fundraisers have \"crossed over\" from the commercial world into the charity sector, Boswell says. \"They use their skills to make a difference rather than flog financial services.\" </p> <p>Stephen George, director of community appeals at NSPCC, does deal with more traditional fundraising. That reflects the heritage of the charity, which was formed as a local group in Liverpool. The professional fundraisers bring the NSPCC's army of volunteers together and offer support to local groups, keeping them in touch with the charity's activity and its campaigns - \"making sure the direction of the society and what we're doing for children is connected on the ground so the supporters feel inspired\", George says. He sums it up as \"a complex set of relationships in a marketing environment\". </p> <p>Anthony Baumann, who heads the 20-strong fundraising team at the RSPCA, says that in big charities, fundraising is a large-scale marketing effort - but with far fewer resources than a commercial marketing department would have. The RSPCA raises money from direct marketing campaigns that have recruited 750,000 \"live donors\" and from legacies, an important source for many charities. </p> <p>But though the resources may be scarce, the atmosphere is different to the cut-throat commercial world too. \"Charities are unbelievably friendly to each other,\" he says. \"Most are not in competition ... so we talk to each other. It's an exciting place to work as a marketeer - you may not make top whack, but you can make a difference.\" </p> <p>Fundraising is not all about house hold-name charities, however. Alison Woolley is a senior development manager at University College London, which last week launched a \u00a3300m fundraising campaign, thought to be the biggest ever university appeal in Britain. Rather than the general public, UCL is targeting wealthy individuals, many from a database of 60,000 or so former students. \"Major gift fundraising is not standing on street corners with a tin,\" Woolley says. </p> <p>Her role involves matching possible donors to a cause that will interest them - perhaps a particular area of the university's research. This involves liaising with the academic staff to find out what they are doing and researching potential donors. \"We have three people in a research team whose job it is to find out about people, their interests and motivations,\" she says. </p> <p>Asking for money is the crucial bit, of course, but Woolley says donors are often pleased to be approached. \"They say how amazing it is to be able to help with something so important.\" </p> <p>For many fundraisers, bringing together the donor and the cause provides their job satisfaction. Roxburgh also points to the variety of the work and the people she meets. \"I don't want each day to be the same - and it's not.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nancy Harrison's cottage has many fine attributes and a tidy, homely feel. But its most outstanding feature is the piece of Britain's heritage at the end of the lawn. In the 1850s, a far-sighted butcher called Matthew Bramley gave a cutting from his apple tree in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, to a local nurseryman, the only proviso being that the resulting fruit should bear his name. Bramley apples are now a \u00a350m a year industry. </p> <p>But despite its place in the agricultural history of the nation, the task of maintaining the original Bramley apple tree, with its golden brown leaves and tangle of knotted branches, falls solely upon Mrs Harrison, 84, a former hospital administrator. </p> <p>Over 40 years, her stewardship of this national landmark has cost \u00a37,000. It is an effort now to rub in methylated spirits to kill the woolly aphids and she sprays the trunk with a garden hose, but since a hip operation her days of pruning have long gone. \"I worry that I can't look after it properly and what will happen to it in the future,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want too much interference. But it would be nice to have some support.\" </p> <p>According to conservationists such as the Tree Council, that support should come from the government, which is being accused of neglecting many of the trees which have cultural, ecological or historical significance. </p> <p>This week, the Tree Council - an umbrella organisation including 150 groups -launches a new book, The Heritage Trees of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, listing 100 trees which have links with some of the great events and battles of centuries past; trees linked with the signing of the Magna Carta, the meeting of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, the theory of gravity, and romance within the court of Mary Queen of Scots. </p> <p>But the Tree Council says that the system for protecting such trees from damage and ensuring that they are properly maintained is itself suffering from decay. Pauline Buchanan Black, the charity's director general, said: \"We have listed buildings and listed landscapes, but not listed trees. Some trees have preservation orders and some are in conservation areas, but they do not provide the sort of protection people think. Any legal shield that exists for historic trees is coincidental, not by design. Heritage trees should qualify as a form of historic monument and should be specifically protected. The government should introduce a system which will safeguard heritage trees, encourage their owners to look after them and advise on their care.\" </p> <p>The issue is not just academic. In June, vandals set fire to the Strathleven oak, one of the oldest oak trees in Scotland, which now stands on an industrial estate near Dumbarton. In prouder days, it stood within the grounds of Strathleven House, which was built in 1700 for William Cochrane of Kilmarnock, the commissioner to parliament for Renfew. A fire was set in the hollow interior which weakened the structure and caused the tree to collapse, leaving little more than a burned out shell. \"Incidents like this show why we need action,\" said Ms Buchanan Black. \"This is history being destroyed.\" </p> <p>Among the changes being sought is a move towards better government coordination. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has responsibility for rural trees, while urban trees and the mechanism for preservation orders fall within the remit of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Agencies such as English Heritage and the Countryside Agency also have an interest. </p> <p>Last year, activists sought to raise the threat to heritage trees with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport during its review of heritage protection, following the consultation paper Protecting Our Historic Environment: Making the System Work Better. But they say they received scant feedback and little indication that things will improve. </p> <p>A department spokeswoman said it accepted the value of heritage trees. \"They have a key role in the historical landscape,\" she said. \"The question of whether they should be on the new register is being looked at by English Heritage and DCMS and no conclusion has yet been reached.\" </p> <p>Mrs Harrison hopes favourable news comes soon. She enjoys showing the original Bramley to people who arrange visits in advance, but there are 200 of them a year. \"They don't all get tea and cake afterwards, but some do,\" she said. \"One Australian couple came and stayed until supper, and a few months ago a man who runs the horticultural society in Japan came here as part of a five day trip. He was thrilled when he saw it. That sort of thing makes it all worthwhile.\" </p> <p><strong>Green leaves in the book of British history</strong></p> <p><strong> Martyrs' tree, Tolpuddle</strong> </p> <p>Where the Dorset labourers met in 1834 to form the first trade union </p> <p><strong> Newton's apple tree</strong> </p> <p>Where Isaac Newton is believed to have been sitting, at Woolsthorpe Manor, Lincs, in 1665 when he formed ideas about gravity </p> <p><strong> Robert the Bruce's yew</strong> </p> <p>Robert the Bruce is said to have sheltered under this yew after crossing to the western shore of Loch Lomond </p> <p><strong> Royal oak, Boscobel</strong> </p> <p>This Shropshire oak is a descendant of the one in which Charles II hid after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 </p> <p><strong> Rizzio's chestnut</strong> </p> <p>Said to have been planted, near Dalkeith, Midlothian, by David Rizzio, the Italian secretary and companion of Mary Queen of Scots </p> <p><strong> Ankerwycke yew</strong> </p> <p>In Runnymede; supposedly a witness to the sealing of the Magna Carta </p> <p><strong> The Wesley beeches</strong> </p> <p>Two saplings planted by John Wesley, near Lisburn, Co Antrim, to form a single tree </p> <p><strong> The Buttingdon yew </strong> </p> <p>Planted in Powys in 846 to mark the defeat of the Vikings at the Battle of Buttingdon </p> <p><strong> The Bleeding yew of Nevern, Pembrokeshire</strong> </p> <p>The 600-year-old tree exudes a blood-like liquid from a cut in the trunk </p> <p><strong> Charlton House mulberry</strong> </p> <p>Planted in 1608 in Greenwich.

  "<p>It's that pink time of year again. Celebrities are sporting pink ribbons, women's glossies are running stories about breast cancer survivors, and the shops are full of a dizzying array of pink-branded merchandise, from which a proportion of the price goes to charity. Breast Cancer Awareness Month has become an incredibly successful mass communication programme, and a professional fund-raising exercise that these days extends to pink-branded Swiss army knives and car tyres.</p> <p>The campaign, now its eleventh year, raises at least \u00a310m annually and has helped save many thousands of lives. But its success also prompts some awkward questions. Who is getting the better deal from these product promotions - the charities or their commercial partners? Are all the products actually appropriate? Are the charities, many of which have enjoyed a surge in funds, spending the cash effectively? And is breast cancer, with its attendant celebrities, fashion shows and pop concerts, drowning out the voices of other, needier cancer charities? </p> <p>The first voices of dissent were heard in the US two years ago, when Breast Cancer Action, a San Francisco-based group of survivors of the disease, launched a \"Think Before You Pink\" campaign. The group coined the phrase \"pink washing\" to describe what they saw as the unfair commercial exploitation of consumers' desire to contribute to breast cancer charities. </p> <p>Breast Cancer Action ran two powerful advertisements in the New York Times. One, headlined \"Who's really cleaning up here?\", highlighted the case of Eureka, a vacuum cleaner manufacturer, that promised to donate $1 on the sale of a $200 product - at 0.5% of the sale price, hardly a generous donation. </p> <p>The other ad attacked the cosmetics industry, one of the biggest drivers of the awareness month; indeed, the pink ribbon campaign was invented by Est\u00e9e Lauder. Under the slogan \"Philanthropy or hypocrisy?\", campaigners highlighted alleged links between chemicals used in cosmetics and breast cancer. </p> <p>Think Before You Pink has now arrived in Britain, albeit without the fanfare of advertising. Instead, Unison, the trade union, and the Women's Environmental Network (WEN) are relying on pamphlets. Consumers are being encouraged to write to Avon, Boots, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Procter &amp; Gamble, all of which are raising funds for breast cancer charities, to ask that they phase out two types of chemicals. The compounds are parabens - widely used in cosmetics as preservatives - and phthalates - generally used to make nail polish more flexible. </p> <p>The science in this area is, unsurprisingly, disputed. Campaigners point to evidence that parabens and phthalates disrupt normal hormone function when absorbed in the body, and that hormone disruption is linked to breast cancer. The case was given force earlier this year when Dr Philippa Darbre of Reading University published a paper in the Journal of Applied Toxicology, showing that parabens were found in some tumour samples taken from women with breast cancer. </p> <p>This is a long way from being a causal link, as the cosmetic companies and breast cancer charities point out. Avon says there has been \"a long history of safe use [of parabens and phthalates], and not only in cosmetics\", while Rohan Hewavisenti, finance director of Breast Cancer Care, for which Boots has raised \u00a31.4m since 1997, says there is no conclusive evidence of a link. </p> <p>\"If the research was conclusive, we would not work with products that were considered to be causing cancer. To date, the only one that has been shown definitively to cause cancer is tobacco.\" </p> <p>The same point is made about car exhausts by Breakthrough Breast Cancer, which benefits from Ford UK's donation of \u00a320 for each consumer who takes a test drive. In the US, Think Before You Pink has questioned components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in car exhaust. </p> <p>\"Our position is that there is no clear evidence that exhaust from cars increases the risk of breast cancer,\" says Peter Reynolds, Breakthrough's director of fund-raising. \"What we do know about our partnership with Ford is that they have raised over \u00a31m so far and are on track to reach \u00a31.25m, which enables us to fund a breast cancer research team for five years.\" </p> <p>But the fact that the link is unproven is not the point, argues Helen Lynn, WEN's health co- ordinator. \"It's a question of how much evidence do you need before you start looking at chemicals and products we use on a daily basis,\" she says. </p> <p>\"When I started doing this work, the incidence [of women in Britain receiving a breast cancer diagnosis during their lives] was one in 12; now it is one in nine. We want more money going into prevention as well as better treatment.\" </p> <p>Prevention accounts for just 2% of the \u00a31bn spent on cancer research in the UK last year, but the full range of the causes of breast cancer are frustratingly hard to identify. New Philanthropy Capital, a body that seeks to guide donors and grant- makers, last month published a comprehensive and objective study of cancer in the UK. It said hereditary factors are thought to account for 10% of breast cancer cases, and that high and prolonged levels of oestrogen are another established link. It added: \"Although scientists cannot be sure of the precise correlation between our industrialised environment and breast cancer incidence ... it does seem clear that our 'lifestyle choices' can put us at risk. Breast cancer incidence is, unsurprisingly, lower in the developing world than in the west; but when Asian women, with a low-risk profile, settle here, their breast cancer incidence rises to western levels.\" </p> <p>Hence the disquiet in some quarters about how a defining trait of industrialised societies - consumerism - has come to be a core source of funds for breast cancer research. This year, for example, Est\u00e9e Lauder launched its US awareness campaign in that ultimate temple of money, a Las Vegas casino. </p> <p>This culture was examined a few years ago by the American feminist Barbara Ehrenreich, who, in an excoriating essay for the US magazine Harper's, explored \"cancerland\" after her own diagnosis with the disease. It was, she wrote, an infantilising world of teddy bears, fun runs and a \"cult of pink kitsch\" in which breast cancer had become the darling of corporate America. \"Let me die of anything but suffocation by the pink, sticky sentiment embodied in that teddy bear,\" she wrote. </p> <p>This degree of sentimentality is less obvious in Britain (although you can still find the teddy bears) and there is nothing as egregious as the Eureka vacuum cleaner offer. Even so, a few oddities leap out from the piles of press releases about product offers. Norfolk Lavender's donation of 40p from sales of its \u00a319.95 \"aromatherapy scarf\" works out at 2%, compared with a going rate of around the 10% mark. And why is it that Debenhams donates 50p per bra while Bhs can afford \u00a31? </p> <p>The charities themselves make strong defences of what they call \"cause-related marketing\". Hewavisenti at Breast Cancer Care, which runs helplines and support centres, says a key advantage of this form of fund raising is that any commercial risk remains with the corporate partners. </p> <p>\"There is no risk of us losing money,\" he says. \"Our biggest single source of income is the pin badge, and when the retailers sell it we get the full money from that. In some cases they just purchase the badges from us. We try to negotiate the best deal possible and it is very low-cost fund-raising for us. If we tried to sell these products ourselves we would struggle, for example, to make \u00a31 per bra.\" </p> <p>Reynolds says that Breakthrough tries to build long-term relationships with corporate sponsors and assesses the costs - such as the commitment to working with the media - at the outset and has turned companies away. \"We go into these partnerships with our eyes wide open,\" he says. </p> <p>In pure fund-raising terms, the system works. Breast Cancer Care, for example, has enjoyed more than a \u00a31m surplus in each of the past two years and can expand its network of regional centres. \"I agree we are in a financially healthy position,\" says Hewavisenti. \"We are very different from a lot of other charities in that 95% of our funds are volunteer-raised. What it means is that we can do long-term planning even if one or two corporate sponsors drop out.\" </p> <p>The charity's chief sponsor is Asda, which last year raised \u00a32m of Breast Cancer Care's annual income of \u00a36.2m; the supermarket says the sums have grown exponentially because of simple grass-roots support for the cause. \"One in nine is a heck of a proportion,\" says corporate affairs director Christine Watts. \"Most people know a friend or relative who has been affected.\" </p> <p>Asda says that in eight years it has received only one letter of complaint about its annual Tickled Pink campaign - and that from somebody who thought the name too jokey. \"Tickled Pink has become part of the calendar and we couldn't do this if it was just a few head office wonks driving it because it was good for the brand,\" says Watts. \"It resonates with colleagues and people who shop with us.\" </p> <p>It also seems to resonate with celebrities. Even the relatively small Breast Cancer Campaign, which funds original medical research, can list a string of famous names who are \"doing their bit\" - Nell McAndrew, Yasmin Le Bon, Caprice, Natasha Bedingfield. Over at Breast Cancer Care's fashion show last week, the hosts were Jerry Hall and Carol Vorderman. </p> <p>That selection is not quite chosen at random, but you can see why Mike Unger, chief executive of the cash-strapped Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, thinks breast cancer is now a \"sexy\" cause. </p> <p>\"Good luck to the breast cancer charities,\" he says, \"but we are deeply frustrated: lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in the world. Breast cancer in the developed world is not as bad a diagnosis as it used to be. Most people with breast cancer are not going to die of it; most people with lung cancer are. The bottom line is that lung cancer is not a sexy illness and breast cancer is.\" </p> <p>There is an obvious reason for that - smokers, the major victims of lung cancer, know the risks - but the disparities in resources are still startling. There are 320 lung cancer nurses in the UK and 15,000 breast cancer nurses, says Unger; the New Philanthropy Capital study also mentioned \"a disconnection between the size of the problem and the amount of money spent researching it.\" </p> <p>The Roy Castle Foundation rubs by on just \u00a31m a year and its awareness-raising month in November will not feature fashion shows, concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, celebrity bingo, or mass-aerobics in Regent's Park. Instead, it will be sending out beer mats giving information on the symptoms to watch for. </p> <p>Just as with breast cancer, early diagnosis saves lives, says Unger, who has a mass of under-publicised stories from survivors who discovered accidentally that they had lung cancer. </p> <p>But it would seem we need celebrities, not beer mats, if we want to reach a mass audience. There are famous names among the Roy Castle Foundation's patrons - Sir Cliff Richard, Alan Hansen, Dame Judi Dench - but they do not attract quite the same attention. Unger tells the story of one world-famous model who is closely associated with breast cancer campaigning. \"Her PA died of lung cancer and I asked if she would do a fashion show for us,\" he says. \"She sent us a cheque for \u00a3100 instead.\" </p> <p>None of the above should, of course, detract from the work done by breast cancer charities. It was charity-funded research that originally helped to develop Tamoxifen, the hormone therapy that has largely been responsible for the reduction in mortality rates since the 1980s. The charities are also refreshingly open about progress in their labs - Breast Cancer Campaign, for example, can point to 170 peer- reviewed publications and presentations in the past eight years. </p> <p>It is impressive stuff and, given that 1,000 women a month in Britain die of breast cancer, the pink issue remains far from black and white. But the campaigners' message is essentially this: start asking questions.</p>",
  "<p>On a crisp and sunlit morning in Surrey, with the languid buzz of an old lawnmower echoing around his enormous garden, Peter Alliss purrs contentedly. \"It's a glorious day,\" he says with the mellifluous hum of a 73-year-old golfer who believes he is seeing England at its very finest. As Alliss walks his three dogs and waves to his two gardeners, the setting seems strangely timeless. Yet, even here, nothing lasts forever. Winter is on its way. </p> <p>Introducing me to his \"bitch\" Buffy, it appears for one terrifying moment as if Alliss is about to parody gangsta-rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard, or pay homage to a foxy young Vampire Slayer, in a desperate attempt to fight the increasingly insistent accusation that he is a blinkered old fogey holding back modern broadcasting. Alliss, however, prefers to confront a more enduring problem in this little corner of England. </p> <p>\"As they're bitches,\" he muses while pointing to his gun dogs, \"they pee all over the place and that burns up the lawn. That's why the chaps over there keep mowing away. It's a constant battle, but they're wonderful hounds . . .\" </p> <p>Alliss, with a photographer to please and a new book to promote, is still enough of an old pro to slip into some serious nose-to-nose action with the lovely Buffy. \"This could make you famous,\" he croons, as if directing one of his conversational commentaries to a young buck standing over a six-footer on the last green rather than his exuberant pooch. </p> <p>It is the kind of velvety chit-chat which has made Alliss the \"voice of golf\" for the past 35 years. And, though two other broadcasting icons, Des Lynam and Barry Davies, have retired from our television screens in recent months, Alliss is about to sign a new three-year contract as the BBC's premier golf commentator. It is an appointment which will be celebrated in clubhouses from St Andrews to Westward Ho as a nostalgic tie to a lost era - but elsewhere it will be lamented by those both in and outside the game who regard Alliss as a pompous archetype of golf's most reactionary traditions. </p> <p>\"Journalists can't resist these snidey little comments,\" he suggests accurately. \"I'm either too old or the person which 20% of the population would most like to disappear. Or they dredge up the terrible faux pas I made at the Masters this year. It was all so silly. I'd been watching [Phil] Mickelson for four hours and knew exactly what was happening. But as he holed the winning putt a voice in my ear said, 'It's not over yet!' And instinctively I said the same words. But the producer wasn't talking about a play-off. He was telling the technicians we had to go into the Butler Cabin and film the presentation. I knew instantly I'd made a mistake but everyone still insisted on making a big deal out of it.\" </p> <p>Though Alliss places himself alongside Richie Benaud in the last bastion of traditional sports commentary, there is little real comparison between the two men. Benaud impressionists focus on the dry Aussie timbre in his voice and the lizard-like flick of his tongue, while his reputation within cricket remains impregnable. Alliss is different. Revered by those who remember how, almost single-handedly, he helped transform golf into a prime-time television sport, his amiable commentary also attracts criticism for its lack of technical description or analytical rigour. </p> <p>\"It's difficult to find adequate replacements,\" Alliss insists. \"It's the same with Benaud. People say, 'Oh, he's getting too old', but he knows everything about cricket. I think I describe the nuances of golf and somebody young and brash might not offer that. So I hope I'll be around for a while yet to keep pointing out those nuances and saying out loud what I think might be wrong.\" </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph suggests of Alliss that, \"when it comes to painting a picture with words, he's nothing short of Rembrandt\". It is, though, a lame old master who once described Shigeki Maruyama as \"the wily Oriental\". </p> <p>Alliss looks briefly mortified. \"That's my own ignorance. I thought 'wily' meant clever or street-smart. I've since looked up the dictionary definition of 'wily' and it basically means 'sneaky'. I meant it in a complimentary way but it came out wrong. So a lot of journalists think I'm Colonel Blimp but it's just not true. </p> <p>\"There's one particular fellow [the former Guardian journalist] Matthew Norman, who writes for the Evening Standard. He doesn't care for me and he writes these pieces where he has me driving a Lexus and wearing gloves. But I've never owned a Lexus or used driving gloves. I did think of writing to him and asking him to lunch - just to find out exactly why he's got this bee in his bonnet about me.\" </p> <p>Alliss, naturally, drives a Bentley rather than a Lexus. He seems mystified to hear that his political views may be a more compelling reason for the loathing he attracts alongside the adoration of middle England. My eyes glaze during Alliss'senthusiastic praise for the death penalty and plea to increase the prison population four times over, but there is one moment when the waffle seems almost shocking in its stark crudity. Pinpointing the exact time \"it all went wrong\" and darkness descended over the country, Alliss is emphatic: \"There's no doubt - and this is well-recorded - the freedom women felt when they got the contraceptive pill took the fear away from illegitimate relationships.\" </p> <p>I must look as if I am about to kick in Alliss's widescreen television - which is tuned silently to the golf on Sky - because he hesitates before he chuckles. \"Yes, I know. I do sound like Colonel Blimp here. But when I was a boy, that was the greatest contraceptive: getting VD or putting a girl in the family way. If you did that, you had to marry her, there were no two ways about it. You made your bed, now you lie in it. The other turning point was the end of National Service. But that's gone. You'd have to have a revolution to bring it back.\" </p> <p>And yet, in an act of personal conviction which is far more intriguing than his right-wing rhetoric, Alliss then reveals why he turned down an OBE in 1993. </p> <p>\"I suppose it's a silly reason but I remember people coming back from the war. When they heard an OBE had been awarded to someone who hadn't fought against the Nazis but had stayed at home and sold sugar on the black market, they'd call it Other Bugger's Efforts. Honours like that should only go to people who are brave in battle or help others less fortunate than themselves. I was just doing a job and there's nothing courageous or special about being a golf commentator. So I was never going to consider an OBE for services to golf. People make assumptions about me but they're usually wrong. They don't know me.\" </p> <p>As he uncovers a little more of the man inside the commentating persona, Alliss describes the great tragedy of his life. His third daughter, Victoria, was born with massive and irreparable brain damage. \"My wife, Jackie, was shattered - but she became a giant. For 11 years she visited Victoria in a home every day, showing her love and tenderness even though it was unlikely anything was being absorbed. I behaved badly. I became an ostrich. I couldn't visit Victoria. </p> <p>\"When she was 11 we got this call late at night to say she had just died. We didn't cause a fuss - but her death did change me. Before then I wanted people to like me. I'd get upset if I walked past old Joe and he didn't say good morning to me for some reason. I suddenly realised, well, maybe his wife left him or his granny died the night before. As long as they don't come and hit me over the head with a golf club, it doesn't matter what they think of me. </p> <p>\"But, as a commentator, I still get hurt by the criticism. I might get a hundred letters and 95 of them are very nice but I remember the five that call me a prick. They're usually badly spelt and scrawled on yellow paper and I wonder why they feel the need to write so vehemently.\" </p> <p>For all the antiquated folksiness of his commentary, the bitterness some feel towards him is also down to the fact that he exemplifies a certain class of people in this country. But Alliss rebuts the suggestion that he was outraged by Ian Poulter's Union Jack trousers or the sight of Jodie Kidd playing alongside Colin Montgomorie at St Andrews last week. \"I don't mind that stuff. People said I'd be offended by young Poulter. I just thought he looked a bit silly - nothing more.\" </p> <p>While clearly not pitching himself to the Poulter posse who read Golf Punk rather than Golf Illustrated, I am still surprised when Alliss reveals whom he pretends he is talking to when delivering his chatty commentaries. Rather than his old chum propping up the bar in an exclusive Dorset clubhouse, Alliss imagines that \"I'm talking to someone stuck in a tiny flat on the 23rd floor of some high-rise in Bermondsey.\" </p> <p>He brushes aside the possibility that the average council-estate resident in south-east London might not be interested in his views on Charterhouse or some \"smashing fellow from the Royal and Ancient\". He argues instead that \"golf gets played in some beautiful places and I try to take the person stuck at home with me. I try to make golf accessible while also highlighting the scenery to that old lady back in Bermondsey. People say I warble on too much about birdsong or the kid in a pram, but I've never been one to say, 'Here's Joe Brown, number 94 on the money list, he's played 48 tournaments so far and won $292,312.' I'm more observant than that.\" </p> <p>Alliss leans forward in his chair. \"You know,\" he says conspiratorially, \"if I hadn't taken up golf, I would've made a good detective. I am very, very observant.\" </p> <p>His gaze narrows and he sizes me up as if he's ready to question me about the bloody murder of Colonel Mustard. \"I would have been a detective like Columbo. All that scratching his head and looking a complete idiot, while prattling on about the most inane rubbish. That sounds like me. But Columbo was extremely observant. He always got there in the end.\" </p> <p>With a defiance that will thrill his followers and infuriate his detractors, Alliss's powers of observation are unlikely to become more introspective in the near future. He seems to be looking up instead at another of his old heroes for inspiration. \"We all reach that point when people think you're getting past it - but what keeps me going is the thought that the BBC offered Dan Maskell, the great tennis commentator, a new three-year contract when he was 81. So there's hope for me yet . . .\" </p> <p>Peter Alliss - My Autobiography is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on October 18 at \u00a318.99.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>GETTING WARMER</b></p> <p>The Monday splashes are a mixed bag.

CO2 has increased by around 1.5 parts per million each year in the past few decades, but levels jumped to 2.08ppm and 2.54ppm in the last two years, with no natural cause - such as the El Nino phenomenon - which is obviously responsible.</p> <p>\"At worst,\" says the Guardian, \"the figures could be the first sign of a breakdown in the Earth's natural systems for absorbing the gas.\" That could accelerate the greenhouse effect, it says.</p> <p>Neil Collins tries to leaven any guilt Telegraph readers might feel with a provocative column praising the fuel efficiency of modern cars and pointing out how much carbon dioxide high-speed trains and exercising humans emit per mile of travel. \"Take the car and save the planet\", he concludes.

  "With the conferences behind us, my mind would ideally be settled on my voting preference. But still I float. <p>Brighton was full of the razzmatazz I expected. If nothing else, Blair is a good speaker and Bono was articulate and his appeal close to my heart. But where I had rallied around the speeches at the last election, I was totally lukewarm and unimpressed this year. At least four - probably five or six - times as many innocent civilians have been killed in Iraq as perished on 9/11; the complex tragedy of the war negates all the carefully woven policies the government presented at its conference. </p> <p>Key workers trying to get on the property ladder are to get subsidies, but what of other first-time buyers? Two of my children - a journalist and an agent in conflict resolution - are desperate to buy in London. Will there be help for them too? In education, I tire of the talk about specialist schools. I've taught in two of them and the concept is more spin than a practical solution. Instead of parental choice of specialist schools, what is desperately needed is a return to education that is based on comprehension and practical learning (ie hands on) rather than a relentless emphasis on attainment targets. Educationalists should be entrusted with school policy: the politicians are getting it all wrong. </p> <p>Similarly in the NHS, I'd rather see basic systems improved in all hospitals - better meals, cleaner wards, higher pay - than ongoing talk of choice. And the pledge to stay on for another full term? I believe that Mr Blair has indeed ceased to be an asset to his party. Not only is he dishonest and unfaithful to the British public, this statement shows that he's selfish too.</p> <p>I tried hard to follow the Conservatives in Bournemouth but I kept losing the plot. I feel there's a lack of zeal that is essential for politicians to exude in order to convince the voting public that they can do the job of leading government. The Tories were just too tight-lipped and restrained in their enthusiasm; it didn't ring true. I agree that we need more police, but I would prefer to see them in specialist areas. For example plain clothes officers in unmarked vehicles with the power to confiscate cars and revoke licences from hotheads who speed, tailgate and drive stupidly would target a serious area of crime. Changes to tax structure would be welcomed. Saying no to Europe for me is contentious. I myself would have to oppose a party that made the matter too black or white.</p> <p> The outcome of the US election is frighteningly relevant to our upcoming general election. We need a government that will dare to do what is right in the international arena and not simply what the Americans do, especially if George Bush is tragically re-elected. We need a PM that will conscientiously act as a bridge between Europe and Washington. Blair could have done it but for some bizarre reason he lost his way. We must look beyond domestic issues to consider what is going to be best for the fragile world of global management.</p>",
  "<p>An unexplained and unprecedented rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere two years running has raised fears that the world may be on the brink of runaway global warming. </p> <p>Scientists are baffled why the quantity of the main greenhouse gas has leapt in a two-year period and are concerned that the Earth's natural systems are no longer able to absorb as much as in the past. </p> <p>The findings will be discussed tomorrow by the government's chief scientist, Dr David King, at the annual Greenpeace business lecture. </p> <p>Measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere have been continuous for almost 50 years at Mauna Loa Observatory, 12,000ft up a mountain in Hawaii, regarded as far enough away from any carbon dioxide source to be a reliable measuring point. </p> <p>In recent decades CO2 increased on average by 1.5 parts per million (ppm) a year because of the amount of oil, coal and gas burnt, but has now jumped to more than 2 ppm in 2002 and 2003. </p> <p>Above or below average rises in CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been explained in the past by natural events. </p> <p>When the Pacific warms up during El Ni\u00f1o - a disruptive weather pattern caused by weakening trade winds - the amount of carbon dioxide rises dramatically because warm oceans emit CO2 rather than absorb it. </p> <p>But scientists are puzzled because over the past two years, when the increases have been 2.08 ppm and 2.54 ppm respectively, there has been no El Ni\u00f1o. </p> <p>Charles Keeling, the man who began the observations in 1958 as a young climate scientist, is now 74 and still working in the field. </p> <p>He said yesterday: \"The rise in the annual rate to above two parts per million for two consecutive years is a real phenomenon. </p> <p>\"It is possible that this is merely a reflection of natural events like previous peaks in the rate, but it is also possible that it is the beginning of a natural process unprecedented in the record.\" </p> <p>Analysts stress that it is too early to draw any long-term conclusions. </p> <p>But the fear held by some scientists is that the greater than normal rises in C02 emissions mean that instead of decades to bring global warming under control we may have only a few years. At worst, the figures could be the first sign of the breakdown in the Earth's natural systems for absorbing the gas. </p> <p>That would herald the so-called \"runaway greenhouse effect\", where the planet's soaring temperature becomes impossible to contain. As the icecaps melt, less sunlight is refected back into space from ice and snow, and bare rocks begin to absorb more heat. This is already happening. </p> <p>One of the predictions made by climate scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that as the Earth warms, the absorption of carbon dioxide by vegetation - known as \"carbon sink\" - is reduced. </p> <p>Dr Keeling said since there was no sign of a dramatic increase in the amount of fossil fuels being burnt in 2002 and 2003, the rise \"could be a weakening of the Earth's carbon sinks, associated with the world warming, as part of a climate change feedback mechanism. It is a cause for concern'.' </p> <p>Tom Burke, visiting professor at Imperial College London, and a former special adviser to the former Tory environment minister John Gummer, warned: \"We're watching the clock and the clock is beginning to tick faster, like it seems to before a bomb goes off.\" </p> <p>Peter Cox, head of the Carbon Cycle Group at the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Change, said the increase in carbon dioxide was not uniform across the globe. </p> <p>Measurements of CO2 levels in Australia and at the south pole were slightly lower, he said, so it looked as though something unusual had occurred in the northern hemisphere. </p> <p>\"My guess is that there were extra forest fires in the northern hemisphere, and particularly a very hot summer in Europe,\" Dr Cox said. \"This led to a die-back in vegetation and an increase in release of carbon from the soil, rather than more growing plants taking carbon out of the atmosphere, which is usually the case in summer.\" </p> <p>Scientists are have dubbed the two-year CO2 rise the Mauna Loa anomaly. Dr Cox said one of its most interesting aspects was that the CO2 rises did not take place in El Ni\u00f1o years. Previously the only figures that climbed higher than 2 ppm were El Ni\u00f1o years - 1973, 1988, 1994 and 1998. </p> <p>The heatwave of last year that is now believed to have claimed at least 30,000 lives across the world was so out of the ordinary that many scientists believe it could only have been caused by global warming. </p> <p>But Dr Cox, like other scientists, is concerned that too much might be read into two years' figures. \"Five or six years on the trot would be very difficult to explain,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Piers Forster, senior research fellow of the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said: \"If this is a rate change, of course it will be very significant. It will be of enormous concern, because it will imply that all our global warming predictions for the next hundred years or so will have to be redone.\" </p> <p>David J Hofmann of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration centre, which also studies CO2, was more cautious. </p> <p>\"I don't think an increase of 2 ppm for two years in a row is highly significant - there are climatic perturbations that can make this occur,\" he said. \"But the absence of a known climatic event does make these years unusual. </p> <p>\"Based on those two years alone I would say it was too soon to say that a new trend has been established, but it warrants close scrutiny.\"</p>",

  "<p>Former BBC director general Greg Dyke has been recruited as an adviser by Apax Partners, the private equity group that has been linked in recent years with a string of media deals including bids for ITV, Trinity Mirror and the Telegraph Group. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, who has declared himself open to offers after completing his book on the events that saw him kicked out of the corporation in the wake of Lord Hutton's report, has joined Apax's media advisory board to help examine possible deals. </p> <p>The board, chaired by former Merrill Lynch star media analyst Neil Blackley, is expected to run the rule over a number of big media deals in the coming year, including a possible bid for Big Brother producer Endemol. </p> <p>A number of private equity groups are looking at Endemol in anticipation of its owner, Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, firing the starting gun on a \u00a31bn-plus auction process. </p> <p>Mr Blackley left Merrill Lynch last year in order to spend more time with his family, but has also been recruited by Apax to spearhead its drive into the media industry across Europe. </p> <p>Last year, Mr Blackley was instrumental in putting together a consortium to bid for ITV prior to the merger of Carlton and Granada. </p> <p>Together with chief executive Stephen Grabiner, he put together a potential management team that included Sky sales chief Nick Milligan and Michael Grade, who then held a number of non-executive positions before he took up his current role as BBC chairman. </p> <p>In the event, shareholders made it clear that they wouldn't entertain a bid before seeing what effect the merger had on the share price. </p> <p>Mr Grabiner, a former executive at the Telegraph and Express newspapers, had already spent several weeks touring the offices of senior media executives and other partners in an effort to win support for an ITV takeover. </p> <p>He even talked to Lord Hollick, his former boss at United Business Media, about a possible return to the world of broadcasting. Apax also lined up Haim Saban, the American entrepreneur behind Power Rangers, as a possible bidding partner</p> <p>Earlier this year, Apax also made it to the final shortlist of bidders to buy the assets of the Telegraph Group from Hollinger International, although it conceded that eventual winners, the Barclay brothers, were always in pole position given their private funding and willingness to pay a premium. </p> <p>Apax is also keeping a very close eye on the German market, where they have also recruited experts to their media board. Private equity groups believe 2005 will be a good time to invest in media and telecoms groups as advertising revenues return and the industry consolidates while share prices remain relatively low. </p> <p>Apax was frustrated in a bid to buy German broadcaster ProSieben from bankrupt media giant Kirch, when Mr Saban clinched his own deal. And in 2002 a risky bid to rescue ITV Digital, the doomed digital broadcaster of which Mr Grabiner was the launch chief executive, also came to nothing. </p> <p>One of Mr Dyke's new colleagues will be ITV chairman Sir Peter Burt, who took up a new role at Apax shortly after accepting the ITV job to advise it on financial services companies, one of six sectors in which in invests.</p> <p>The broadcasting rumour mill went into overdrive earlier this year when Sir Peter was spotted talking to Mr Dyke at the Apax offices, sparking speculation that he was being lined up to replace ITV chief executive Charles Allen. </p> <p>Mr Burt was forced to issue a statement publicly backing Mr Allen, and the likelihood of Mr Dyke being offered the ITV job further receded when it became clear that Fidelity, the investment bank that forced the departure of Carlton chairman Michael Green, was happy with the current management for now. </p> <p>The group's current media investments include cable group NTL and publishing company Future Network. It was also a founder investor in Virgin Radio. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "It worked for St Paul, who became a saint and one of the founding fathers of Christianity after ditching the name Saul of Tarsus. <p>Now plain old Paul Gascoigne is taking his own road to Damascus. Fed up with his \"daft as a brush\" image as Gazza, the former England midfielder intends to follow St Paul, Muhammad Ali and P Diddy by changing his name. The 37-year-old has not yet revealed what he wants to be called, but \"Gazza\" and \"Paul\" remind him too much of his manic practical jokes and alcohol problems, which blighted his career and led to a spell at an addiction clinic in Arizona two years ago. </p> <p>\"Paul's not right for us because it's too closely linked with Gazza,\" he said. \"I need a new first name.

Gascoigne will keep his surname, but will find a replacement for \"Paul\" after talking it over with his family. \"I have to get my reputation back,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"I need to get respect again. I want people to see me not think, 'Great player, but remember Gazza'. People have to forget that.

  "Mary Kenny (La hate cuisine, October 8) states that a majority of the French no longer sit around a table for meals, and take just 20 minutes to prepare them. <p>She seems not to have been recently to France since she quotes Elizabeth David and the existentialists. May I reassure her that during a weekend in September with friends at Etretat we had a delicious coq au vin and terrine de l\u00e9gumes, home-made, the latter by a male guest, and most of the talk was about food and the range of alcohol one can make with oranges. </p> <p>It is flippant of Kenny to rejoice that more people buy convenience foods.

  "Investigation of the cause of the fire on the Canadian submarine Chicoutimi begins today, after its safe arrival at Faslane naval base on the Clyde. <p>It arrived late yesterday afternoon, towed by tugs and shadowed by British and Canadian navy vessels, ending a five-day ordeal for its 54 remaining crew </p> <p>One died and two others were seriously injured in the fire, which disabled the vessel and left it adrift in the Atlantic last Tuesday, three days after it left Faslane for Canada. </p> <p>With the submarine docked and its \"exhausted and emotional\" crew recovering in a Glasgow hotel, the political row about its purchase is likely to gather pace. But the Canadian navy insisted last night that the vessel was seaworthy when it left Britain. </p> <p>\"I stand absolutely convinced that the sub was in all respects ready to sail and proceed to sea when it left,\" Vice-Admiral Bruce MacLean told a press conference at Faslane. \"We don't know what happened on the sub. That's why we are going to have this board of inquiry to find out.\" </p> <p>Earlier the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said the Chicoutimi, one of four nearly new submarines sold by the UK to Canada, was fit for its purpose when it was handed over, and that the incident was not an embarrassment to Britain. </p> <p>\"These boats were brought up to Royal Navy standards,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World this Weekend. </p> <p>\"They had undergone rigorous trials and tests and, indeed, Canada has had the opportunity over very many years of surveying the boats and obviously has been in negotiation with the United Kingdom during that period. So I think ... 'buyer beware' is absolutely accurate\". </p> <p>The Chicoutimi, formerly HMS Upholder, is one of four Victoria-class diesel-powered subs mothballed by the Royal Navy in 1994 when the deci sion was taken to have an all-nuclear fleet, and sold to Canada in 1998 for \u00a3244m. It was the last to be handed over, after being prepared for service by BAE Systems. </p> <p>Mr Hoon, who is due to meet the Canadian defence minister, Bill Graham, today, said he did not want relations with Canada, \"an important friend and ally\" to be soured by what had happened. </p> <p>But in Canada the government has been urged to sue London for selling submarines said to have suffered \"serious malfunctions and corrosion\". Opposition parties have ques tioned the legitimacy of the sale and the Canadian navy has pledged to undertake a full investigation. </p> <p>Adm MacLean said it had been a rollercoaster time for all involved, and paid tribute to the professionalism of the Chicoutimi's crew and the rescue teams which came to their aid. </p> <p>\"It's what I would call subdued, emotional, heart-warming, with a degree of pride that I rarely see and, for me personally, equally one of the proudest and most difficult times of my career. </p> <p>\"I'm very proud of the sailors in Chicoutimi. These sub-mariners over the last number of days have done some remarkable things.\" </p> <p>One seaman was washed overboard while rescue divers were attaching the tow to the vessel and, although saved from drifting away by a lifeline, was trapped by the feet. </p> <p>Leading Diver Garth Spence, of the Northern Diving Group, at Faslane, said: \"I put my flippers on and jumped in. He said 'cut me free, I think I only have two breaths left'. </p> <p>\"I just sat down next to him and gave him a big hug and told him he was going to be all right. He was very panicky.\" </p> <p>As the boat was towed up the Clyde yesterday, applauded by wellwishers on the foreshore, the body of Lieutenant Chris Saunders was being flown back to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it was to be met by the Canadian prime minister, Paul Martin. </p> <p>Lt Saunders, 32, the father of two young children, was one of three crew airlifted from the submarine. He died a short time later in hospital in Sligo. </p> <p>The other two are still in hospital, suffering the effects of smoke inhalation but their condition has been improving.</p>",
  "Ask Enfield residents whether the Labour government has made them feel safer on the streets, and it's not the threat of international terrorism that worries so much as the corrosive spots that blight their daily lives - the youths hanging around, the abandoned vehicles that attract crime, the graffiti and the dog dirt. <p>Labour has made several legislative changes designed to enable local authorities and the police to improve daily life. The Conservative-led council in Enfield has, moreover, made the quality of life on the streets a priority and concentrated money and resources on it. The result is a new optimism among the professionals in the borough that improvements are slowly being delivered. Out on the streets, though, the public is not satisfied that the changes have come fast enough. </p> <p>\"If you see something horrible in your area as a member of the public, you don't want to have to navigate the planning department, the environmental health department and the cleansing department to get something done. You want to ring up the council and know it will be fixed,\" explains Mike Hainge, assistant director in the council's environmental health department. </p> <p>A new \"envirocrime\" unit, set up with money from the council budget but with extra funds coming from the police through central government initiatives, has helped provide some \"joined-up thinking\". </p> <p>For example, most low-level crime and antisocial behaviour takes place at night, but in the past if residents rang the police to complain they would often be told that a particular problem fell under the council's remit, and that the council was available only in office hours. Now, the envirocrime unit functions at night. It also works closely with local police officers who know who can get things moving. </p> <p>In addition, trading standards officers have worked hard to tackle the sale of alcohol to children. A blitz of undercover test purchases in off-licences led to several prosecutions, and the stores appear to have a more cautious approach to selling. Since the undercover work, the ambulance service in the Upper Edmonton area has reported a 50% drop in the number of call-outs to alcohol-related accidents. </p> <p>The fire brigade has also seen dramatic savings. It has spent \u00a31m less on putting out car fires in the last year as the number of vehicles abandoned on the streets has fallen. A combination of legislative changes to allow faster removal of such cars, and money from both central and local government to pay the cost of taking them away, has produced results. </p> <p>The borough has seen the number of dumped cars fall by a fifth in the last two years. Neighbouring Haringey has, however, seen a 29% increase. \"There may be some displacement of crime going on, but we have brought prosecutions, so people now know we are not a good place to dump their cars,\" Mr Hainge says. </p> <p>On the Lytchett Way estate, community wardens who started work less than a year ago have brought a sense of security to a most troubled neighbourhood. But one of the wardens, a former UN peacekeeper called Tonka al-Hassan, has already resigned. Government funding from the neighbourhood renewal programme was available for only two years. It took 18 months to recruit and train the wardens, and so six months after they started work the cash ran out. </p> <p>The project has continued with some money from the council and an extension from the Home Office, but now residents must decide whether they are prepared to pay for the service themselves. Each would have to pay about \u00a32.30 a week. Mr Hassan was popular and loved the job, but could not continue working under such uncertainty and has taken a job elsewhere. Work to make the leap from a successful pilot project to a long-term, financially viable operation has proved tough. </p> <p>Enfield has made use of the new legislation bringing in anti-social behaviour orders (Asbo). Six have been served on people who were a persistent nuisance. In addition, 43 of the less draconian acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) have been issued to people causing misery to neighbours. Only one has been breached. \"They have been most successful with youths who treated the magistrate system with contempt because they knew the threat of prison for minor offences would never be delivered. But an Asbo is a court order and a matter of record; if you breach it you can go to prison. The newspapers print your picture, the community knows you can [go to prison] too, so it gives them confidence,\" Mr Hainge says. </p> <p>Although most people on the streets agree the borough is cleaner than before, with litter, dumped cars and vandalism dealt with faster, it is the blight that they still notice. </p> <p>A mother with young twins playing in the small new playground behind the Edmonton shopping centre, where the grim old high-rises have been refurbished or replaced with smart low-rise housing, is angry and depressed that the new climbing frames have already been sprayed with graffiti. </p> <p>Leford Thompson, employed by the housing management to clean up the streets, cannot believe how little people care about their environment. \"You just finish your work and they start littering it all over again. It's very discouraging.\" </p> <p>Leon Pali, a stall owner in a shopping centre which is to have its front replaced, believes things are getting worse. \"Safety is still a big problem here,\" he says. </p> <p>When pressed, he admits the part of the borough where he lives is much better. \"It's been cleaned up and feels safer.\" So are things getting better overall? \"They should do more.\" </p> <p><b>The Guardian's unique Enfield project</b></p> <p>Labour will be judged at the next general election in large part on whether it has succeeded in improving public services. In an attempt to build up a definitive picture in one local area, the Guardian is putting Enfield under a journalistic microscope. A team of specialist reporters returns to the London borough regularly to investigate performance in such areas as health, education and crime. Every month until the election we will publish their findings, providing a rare insight into the crucial challenge facing Tony Blair: is Labour delivering?</p>",
  "<p>Profit warnings by UK firms rose 15% in the third quarter of the year from the second to their highest level since the beginning of 2003, a survey published today shows.</p> <p>The quarterly profit warning survey from Ernst &amp; Young says 74 companies issued warnings in the July to September period, 10 more than in the second quarter. There were 38 warnings in September alone, the highest figure since October 2002.</p> <p>\"Despite the late burst in September, we do not predict a sharp increase of warnings as the economic environment remains cautious but positive,\" said Andrew Wollaston of E&amp;Y.</p> <p>\"With the annual growth of GDP still well above 3% and interest rates expected to reach 5% in the coming months, consumer and corporate confidence remain relatively strong, albeit marked by caution over spending decisions,\" he added.</p> <p>Companies in the household goods and textiles sector issued the highest number of warnings - eight - followed by general retailers and media and entertainment companies, which issued seven warnings each.</p> <p>The support services sector and software and computer services sector each produced six warnings. E&amp;Y said textiles firms were suffering because of a push into clothing by supermarkets, which tend to source goods from cheaper foreign suppliers.</p> <p>That would tie in with data from the ONS last week that revealed domestic textile production hit an all-time low in August. Some sectors such as IT hardware, construction and leisure and hotels saw a decline in profit warnings, however.</p> <p>Oliver Letwin, the Tory shadow chancellor, said the survey confirmed the need to \"lift the shackles of regulation\" from business. \"We are now 11th instead of 4th in the international competitiveness league.</p> <p>\"For manufacturing to prosper in the face of tough international competition, we have to lift the regulatory burden and lighten the tax load instead of adding 15 new regulations per working day and imposing 66 new stealth taxes.\"</p>",
  "<p>TV advertising<br> </p> <p><strong> And here's an ad we made 25 years earlier</strong><br> The latest love tussle between Steve, Karen and Amy was not the only interesting thing about last night's Coronation Street. Viewers were treated to what is believed to be the longest commercial in UK primetime television - a three-and-a-half minute ad dedicated to another great British institution, the chip. </p> <p>The story behind this \u00a33.75m extravaganza, which marks the 25th anniversary of McCain's oven chips, is a tale of PR spin and technical trickery. Behind it all are Trevor Beattie and his agency TBWA\\London. </p> <p>Beattie hit upon the idea of \"discovering\" a promotional film, supposedly created by McCain at its Scarborough headquarters in 1979, to celebrate the invention of the oven chip. It would be presented by a 70s icon: Blue Peter's Valerie Singleton. </p> <p>The publicity for the film began a fortnight ago when an ad was placed in the Scarborough Evening News asking if anyone knew where the \"lost\" film was. The paper, unaware of the stunt, ran a story when McCain bosses offered free chips for a year to anyone who came forward. A few days later, the paper revealed that a local man had apparently found the film. </p> <p>A march was subsequently organised in Soho in which \"Valerie fans\" called for the film to be aired on television. This was followed by radio and press ads encouraging people to watch ITV at 7.45pm on Sunday. </p> <p>Opening with an intro from Singleton as she is today, a silver-haired 67-year-old, it then cuts, apparently, to her in her Blue Peter heyday. In a low-tech studio, Singleton investigates what the turn of the 70s will be remembered for. After seeing clips of 3-2-1 and The Bernard Manning Show, her face says it all. No, the only thing worth noting in 1979 is, she says dramatically: \"the abolition of Fry-Days!\" </p> <p>Then follows the original 1979 ad before Singleton speculates on a future when we will have \"300 channels, distressed denim and speed bumps\". She even ventures that a Russian billionaire will buy Chelsea FC. </p> <p>The director was Duncan ZH Jones, more famously known as Zowie Bowie, son of David. The director is reluctant to play on this fact but no doubt he and Singleton will fan the flames of publicity for some time. </p> <p>As for the future of the 30-second ad? Could it have had its chips? <br><strong>Dawn Daniels</strong> </p> <p><strong> Press</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Hacks on moral high ground</strong><br> Two journalists are suing Northern Ireland's chief constable for damages after they were arrested during an armed midnight raid on their home. </p> <p>Liam Clarke, Northern Ireland editor of the Sunday Times, and his wife Kathryn Johnston, who co-wrote a biography of Sinn Fein MP Martin McGuinness, were arrested under the Official Secrets Act in April 2003. Police arrested them after a new version of Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government featured transcripts of phonecalls between McGuinness, Jonathan Powell, Mo Mowlam and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams - allegedly bugged by MI5. </p> <p>No classified documents were found but police took sackloads of material including computers, notes and contact books. Clarke and Johnston were arrested and questioned for more than 20 hours. </p> <p>Last week, Northern Ireland's police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, declared the raids \"poorly led and unprofessional\". She said the seizure of journalistic material was unlawful. Eight police officers now face disciplinary action, but O'Loan upheld the officers' right to make arrests. </p> <p>The journalists were finally told last week that no charges would be brought against them. But a retired special branch officer accused of being one of their sources was remanded on bail for trial. </p> <p>The pair have refused to name their sources, and have launched a civil action against the chief constable, Hugh Orde, for false arrest, false imprisonment and trespass. </p> <p>Johnston said she felt vindicated by the police ombudsman's findings but questions remained about police attitudes to journalists. Liam Clarke said the civil action was a way to put down a \"marker\" so that police raids did not become standard procedure against journalists. He said the police gained nothing from the search, which he felt was a \"punishment\", a way of scandalising the neighbours, upsetting the journalists' lives and putting people off speaking to them.<br><strong>Angelique Chrisafis</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Marketing</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> \u00a3100m well spent?</strong><br> What's in a name? Around \u00a3100m if you're Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood. Last week's recordbreaking sponsorship deal with Emirates is good for the club, which took out hefty loans to fund its new stadium, and manager Arsene Wenger, who will have more cash to buy players. </p> <p>But is it good news for the Middle Eastern airline? It will shell out over \u00a345m to have Arsenal's new 60,000-seat stadium named the Emirates Stadium for at least 15 years from 2006 as part of a \u00a3100m deal that also includes shirt sponsorship. Traditionalists may not be happy at swapping the romance of Highbury for the commercialism of the Emirates Stadium, but experts are convinced the airline has got a good deal. </p> <p>It has, they point out, been looking for a blockbuster sponsorship deal for some time, having felt that its shirt deal with Chelsea was not delivering the hoped-for impact. When Vodafone signed its original contract with Manchester United in 2000, it is believed that Emirates tabled a bigger bid but the Old Trafford club decided to go with the larger brand. And they say that recent experience suggests the new name has a good chance of sticking, attached as it is to a new ground with no history. So while the Walkers Stadium and the Reebok Stadium have become common parlance, the Brit Oval hasn't. </p> <p>Analysts agree that the big question is whether Emirates will be able to make the most of its investment. Unlike a phone company or broadcaster, it has no obvious means of leveraging its links with the club. Much also depends on what happens on the pitch - if Arsenal can establish themselves as one of the giants of the global game, it will be money well spent. </p> <p>BLM Sports Marketing managing director Andy Clilverd is one who believes the airline has played a blinder. \"They are paying \u00a37m per annum to market in a medium that transcends international barriers and has global viewing of over 140 million per week and is broadcast live in over 150 countries,\" he says. He estimates that this exposure would cost in excess of \u00a3300m a season - making \u00a3100m over 15 years very good value.<br><strong>Owen Gibson</strong> </p> <p><strong> Radio</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> The Key talent spotters</strong><br> When radio's brightest prospects JK and Joel bounced onto the national airwaves this summer, they were more than just another cheeky double-act - they joined an impressive list of Manchester Key 103 FM alumni who have helped to shape the media industry over three decades - including Dave Lee Travis, Chris Evans, Richard Keys, Timmy Mallett and Steve Penk. Breakfast viewing habits, Premiership football, children's TV and national radio have been transformed by talent nurtured at the Emap-owned station that started life as Piccadilly Radio in 1974, one of the early pioneers in commercial radio. </p> <p>The station was at the heart of the Manchester music scene, just minutes from the Hacienda club. And as the action moved from the centre, they relocated their decks in 1996 to the regenerated Castle Quay area on the outskirts, and home to the emerging trendy bar and music culture. </p> <p>When JK and Joel transferred to the north-west from Hull, where their radio broadcasting partnership began, they were soon spotted, scooping gold and silver Sony Radio awards for their breakfast show, which ran from 2000 until Radio 1 snapped them up in 2004. Jason King and Joel Ross have created a successful rapport with an infectious style and their laddish qualities have been bolstered by stints presenting Playboyz on Men and Motors and filming with comedian Peter Kay, as well as fronting a soap fanzine on BBC3. </p> <p>Their cheeky characters suited the BBC's criteria, with a recent show, for example, featuring chat about booze, birds and ... tractors. Now they form the centrepiece of weekend afternoons, but in an incident reminiscent of Chris Evans's antics, Joel was fired from Key for failing to turn up after a heavy night out. </p> <p>Since launching on July 31, they have been dubbed the hottest property in broadcasting. Yet their afternoon post-hangover banter pays only fleeting attention to music and once a track ends, the zany entertainment, including bizarre segments such as \"Adopt a Granny\", kicks in. </p> <p>Their former employers at Key aren't surprised that their DJs make it big. \"By allowing presenters to express themselves on air naturally, their personalities are what engages our audiences and so attracts the talent spotters,\" says programme director Anthony Gay.<br>Rob Harris</p>",
  "<p>Ever since a so-called \"wardrobe malfunction\" revealed Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl half time show in January, American television has been swept up in a panic about sex on television, the moral of equivalent of Hurricane Ivan. The Federal Communications Commission has finally proposed a record $550,000 fine against CBS for what has been dubbed Nipplegate. </p> <p>The FCC stated: \"Anything goes is not an acceptable mantra for those that elect to earn their profits on the public airwaves\". Since Jackson revealed all, the FCC has been throwing fines around like confetti at a wedding and so far this year's penalties have easily overtaken the total sum for the last ten years added together. </p> <p>There is more to come. In June the US Senate overwhelmingly voted to raise the standard fine ten fold, from a paltry $27,500 to $275,000 per incident with a $3m daily tariff available for persistent violations. </p> <p>So for months broadcasters have been blindly rewriting and cutting programmes, trying to judge the political mood music which has grown more insistent as the election grows closer. Producers no longer know where nervous networks are drawing the hazy line on taste. As Steven Bochco, creator of Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue, said recently, \"I'm not doing something I know is to be really provocative. If I do the networks will blur it. They will cut it. They will perform artless surgery.\" </p> <p>Artless surgery has already been performed on ER, where the breast of an elderly cancer patient was deemed offensive and even on the US version of the Antiques Roadshow, where a 50-year old lithograph of a nude was hurriedly excised. When public television edited out language in Prime Suspect that was previously acceptable there was a chorus of complaints about censorship. </p> <p>While the regulated public airwaves - the networks and public radio and television - grow ever more uncertain and anxious as the chilling effect of cultural McCarthyism sets in, cable channels, unaccountable to the FCC, grow ever more explicit. </p> <p>A recent opinion poll indicated that viewers were more relaxed about sexual content than the politicians proclaimed, with just 17% of those surveyed \"very concerned\" about the Jackson incident. This is little comfort to the regulated over-the-air networks who are losing ground to anything-goes cable channels. As one pollster put it: \"The audiences think that cable is more entertaining, more provocative and unique.\" He might have added that cable is more opinionated, and more politically biased. </p> <p>In the ever more fractious, ever more tetchy debate between left and right in the run-up to an election the quickest way to write a bestseller is to pen a polemic about media bias. So Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly from the right, and Michael Moore and Al Franken on the left, slug it out with John Grisham and Tom Clancy in the bestseller list. </p> <p>Taste and decency has increasingly become part of this political eye gouging. The rightwing Parents Television Council led the email campaign against Jackson. </p> <p>The even more rightwing American Family Association continue to attack Disney \"for their promotion of the homosexual agenda\", claiming that \"While a day at Disney World might not seem like Sodom and Gomorrah it might just take us there\". All this white noise has inhibited not just producers in drama but the gatherers of news. </p> <p>The recent funeral in Phoenix of an ex-football star soldier who was killed in Afghanistan was unceremoniously pulled in the middle of a live broadcast when a speaker used bad language. </p> <p>All this is a neat diversion from some of the real obscenities lurking in the American television undergrowth: the potent effect of negative political election advertising; the lack of robust political interviewing; the absence of tough investigations like The Secret Policeman; the blurring of content and commerce as product placement runs wild. </p> <p>For British television, more tightly regulated and with a stronger public service ethos baked into the system, this might all seem very distant and quaintly American. But, as ever, America is the canary in the television coalmine. Here some politicians would like to switch from party political broadcasts to advertising; robust interviewers are subjected to widespread criticism; attempts are made to suppress investigations like The Secret Policeman; in the Sky Plus and Tivo world, commercial broadcasters here will also increasingly push for product placement. </p> <p>As we start the long wind-up to our own election it's worth noting how political the imperatives of US global media companies are. Sumner Redstone of Viacom, the owner of CBS. put it neatly: \"I don't want to denigrate Kerry ... but from a Viacom standpoint the election of a Republican administration is a better deal.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Willis is the BBC's director of factual and learning.</p>",
  "<p>Children's television is a mega global business. Some of the multimillion-dollar numbers involved are enough to bring tears (of joy, that is) to the eyes of the most hardened City investor. So what are we to make of the news that ITV, Britain's premier commercial broadcaster, is considering selling its children's airtime to Nickelodeon? </p> <p>On the face of it, Britain's most commercial broadcaster has failed to grasp the major commercial opportunities offered by one of the most lucrative areas of the television business. In reality, there are three interrelated factors behind its thoughts of selling - the broken-backed ownership of ITV pre-merger with the attendant role of the Network Centre, the profoundly unhelpful approach of the old regulator (the ITC) and the nature of the children's business itself. </p> <p>To take the last first. Much children's TV is funded by merchandising and about 80% of the revenues are from off TV. In other words, ad revenue is nowhere near the most significant revenue stream associated with this type of programming. In effect, TV is the shop window for sales of branded goods - toys, pyjamas, paper plates, potties - you name it and I bet there's one with a Pok\u00e9mon on it. </p> <p>Broadcasters have responded to this in two main ways. Either they have used the value of their airtime - the shop window - to force down the price they pay producers for the programming or they have sought to play the whole game themselves by originating the programming and using their own airwaves as effectively as possible to create a market for the attendant merchandising. At one extreme, it is not unusual in the US for broadcasters to charge producers a fee and demand a share of their other revenues in exchange for broadcasting their children's programmes. At the other, there is the BBC, which has turned Teletubbies and Tweenies into global money-spinners. It has organised the use of its airwaves so its properties get the maximum and most effective exposure, especially at key times (such as the lead up to Christmas), making it the UK's most effective commercial kids player by far. </p> <p>ITV, meanwhile, is stuck in the terrestrial space alone with no dedicated children's channel, still paying over the odds for programmes that go on to make other people lots of money and unable to grasp the whole value chain in the the way the BBC has. To ITV, children's programmes are loss-makers - the advertising revenue barely covers the cost - and the requirement to do them at all is part of what it regards as overburdensome regulatory obligations. </p> <p>There are broadly two reasons for this - both historical and to some degree beyond ITV's control. First, the programmes ITV made were not owned by the network but by the then individual companies, such as Granada or Carlton. The network could be judged only in terms of ad revenue - it had no share in the ultimate value of the property beyond its immediate value to the ITV schedule. </p> <p>Second, there is the role played by the then regulator - the ITC. The idea, which still underpins so much regulation, that commercial activity must always be separate from editorial content, was played out in the children's arena in the most ostrich-like fashion. Programmes were not allowed, for instance, if merchandise related to the characters was already in the shops. But these rules didn't apply to foreign acquisitions or the BBC. This amounted to a wilful failure to understand the dynamics of the marketplace and hobbled ITV. </p> <p>In fairness, not all ITV's required kids' programmes can be regarded as big potential moneyspinners. General entertainment and factual shows featuring real kids (as opposed to merchandisable characters) may have extra value as formats internationally, but are not in the Power Rangers, Sponge Bob or Teletubbies league. Nevertheless the fact is that ITV has been unable to turn its children's block into the valuable asset it could have been, which might have sustained and nurtured ITV's considerable contribution to public service children's programming for the future. </p> <p>But back to reality. ITV still sees its children's block through ad sales' eyes as a liability and has failed to establish a presence in the multichannel marketplace so beloved of many young viewers and as such is some way behind the pack. So maybe that's it - game over, bring on Nick or Disney? Shame though.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Steve.hewlett1@btinternet.com\">Steve.hewlett1@btinternet.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I was fascinated by the recent furore over the Ford viral ad. The one where the cat jumps on to the roof of the car, sticks its head into the open sunroof and gets it chopped off as it closes. Outrage of course from the great British animal-loving public and total denial by the Ford motor company that it had anything to do with it. Well there's a surprise. </p> <p>True or false - what makes this incident interesting is the role of viral media in the burgeoning digital world. As conventional media fight for their place in the severely challenged budgets of clients, the rise of viral is seen as a \"get out of jail card\" for brands with stretched budgets. Make an ad that's outrageously funny, daring or irreverent and launch it into the digital firmament. And hopefully it gets free airplay on millions of screens. Until, of course, the cat loses its head and the client denies all responsibility. </p> <p>In this increasingly borderless world, we are the recipients of messages and ideas that enter our consciousness unannounced and unsupported. Are they real? Who is talking? Is it serious? Should I place any value upon it? The reality is that a medium only has a worth if it is prepared to take responsibility for its actions. One of the reasons why no brand has ever been created by flyposting. But it goes deeper than just the value of the media. What is in danger of being lost in the viral world is the value of context. Where an idea comes from, who said it, why they believe in it, are all vital components of what makes an idea powerful. </p> <p>Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel has a power not just because of the message the artist was trying to convey but in the manner and place he said it. Its context added to its influence. Hardly surprising it has become one of the world's greatest works of art. Had he painted it on the ceiling of a friend's taverna, one somehow feels it wouldn't have had the same cultural significance. Context played a fundamental part in its impact. </p> <p>And it goes deeper than Marshall McLuhan's famous \"the medium is the message\". It is about being connected to an idea and the consequent importance we therefore place upon it. Of which, media is a vital part. </p> <p>Brands also live or die by context. The value we put upon them is directly related to how we position them in our minds. That context can be geographical as well as emotional. The most obvious example is the car market. We view a car brand partly in relation to the geography of its heritage. To such an extent that, even though Volkswagen now owns Bentley, it still makes the car in Britain as opposed to Wolfsburg, despite the fact that it could quite easily be produced in Germany. It is, however, seen as quintessentially British, and it must for the sake of its brand values retain those links. Context influences its design, manufacture and its communication. Severing the brand's ties with those links endangers its value. </p> <p>Microsoft, rightly or wrongly, is perceived by many to be the evil empire and is therefore attacked by mindless viruses that distract the brand from its global domination. It is within this emotional context of domination that the brand must respond and organise its defence. Context even defines the framework of a virtual product. </p> <p>It's obvious really, but everything about us relates to context. Where we were born, where we live, how we talk. Our ambitions, desires and fears all relate back to context in some shape or form. It is embedded in the very DNA of our thought process. It can't be jettisoned simply because we can so easily communicate across borders. </p> <p>Interesting, isn't it, that as we see the growing influence of globalisation and \"world citizens\", we also see the rise of regional languages that reconnect people to their roots. Even the stuff we eat is based on this fundamental fact. Italian, Indian, Chinese and even fusion is influenced by context. I've yet to hear someone say, \"I'm eating virtual tonight\". </p> <p>Yet this is what the viral world is in danger of missing. Will we have to develop a different set of communication skills to cope with a lack of context? Almost certainly. If, however, as a medium it just relies on shock to get its \"click through\", we soon find, as that poor cat did, that it will fall out of sympathy. Brand building is not just about recognition and notoriety, it is about building empathy and respect. I'm not sure you can just shock somebody into that point of view.</p>",
  "<p>Hands up everyone who has squandered a precious slice of their careers on the mindnumbing abomination that is the induction day? So that's all of us then? What is it about induction days? There must be other ways of sucking life from new recruits than making them watch hours of health and safety films, the corporate equivalent of snuff movies. Why do PAs or account managers need to know the potential horrors of driving a fork-lift truck anyway?</p> <p>You've all been there, shivering with delighted anticipation on the first day in your new office. Yet no sooner have you flashed your security card than you're bundled into a meeting room to have your ambition forcibly ripped from you. At the last induction day, I attended, a demonstration of carrying boxes coupled with a discussion on car parking sent me into a drooling slumber. I wouldn't have minded, except that the moment the sorry day ended, I was shackled to my desk, where I remained for the next four years.</p> <p>It's no wonder induction days are gaining global cult status. Gwyneth Moore, now a mature student near Newport, recalls her first experience. \"I lived in Sydney and got a job at the Government Insurance Office,\" she says. \"I had to advise businesses on their insurance needs, although I knew nothing about it. I should have learned everything on the induction day, but the organisation kept putting it off. I eventually had my induction three days before I left. Only then did I find out that I had been dishing out the wrong information for months on end. I've steered clear of working for government organisations ever since.\"</p> <p>A new job is like a first date. You glam up, practice your winning smile and hope for fun and frolics. Then it all goes sour when your date turns up in greasy jeans and Old Spice. It's the same when your new employer doesn't make the effort. Ruth Spellman, chief executive of Investors in People, explains. \"This should be a chance to make a great first impression on recruits,\" she says. \"An induction day should be inspirational and motivating, reminding staff that they are important to the company. They should be handed goody bags or given a welcoming letter from the CEO. It shows that the company cares. Instead, many inductions leave recruits feeling that they just don't count.\" Goody bags? My sort of induction day. Although, frankly, I'd settle for a tour of the vending machines and personal introductions to the most eligible men in the company.</p> <p>Induction days are designed to show staff the ropes as well as laying the foundations for a productive relationship between employer and employee. Effective inductions are also a chance for recruits to ask their own burning questions. There should be feedback into the company, says James Reed, CEO of recruitment consultancy Reed. \"It's a two-way process. Organisations should take the opportunity to tap into the knowledge of employees to create an interactive induction process.\" But for most of us, the closest we get to interactive inductions is when the host prods us awake. However, there is one rare creature who has fond memories of her induction day at the office of the Western Mail newspaper in Cardiff. Georgina Robertson recalls, \"The day made me glad to be part of the company. I learned about the courses I could go on and was encouraged to try for promotion. The best part was the level of commitment. It sounded as if the Western Mail was the only place to be.\"</p> <p>So some employers must be taking notice, then. Recent research has shown that one in five workers leaves within six months of starting. This is linked to the lack of effective induction procedures which makes employees feel unwanted. However, Frances Wilson, HR adviser at the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development believes that this is easily rectified. \"Most businesses have got professional recruitment strategies in place,\" she says. \"New recruits love that, but their hearts sink when the induction doesn't match their expectations. The trick is to make the induction day as professional as other parts of the recruitment process. It should also be part of an induction package which should cover the first three months of work. It's hardly rocket science is it?\" Frances, I've a feeling you're preaching to the converted.</p>"
