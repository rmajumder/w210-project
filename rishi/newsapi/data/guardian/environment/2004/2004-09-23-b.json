  "Damp, mild weather has encouraged the insect world, and in this county we have a butterfly boom. The comma butterfly has been in decline during the past century; it is a woodland species but, in the right environment, can be found in southern country lanes and gardens. This year it has been reported in northern Britain. We have also welcomed the peacock butterfly, and the migratory painted lady was reported seen at Chesters in Roman Wall country. <p>The painted lady has not been able to survive our winters; the majority perish so they migrate. In spring these beautiful butterflies arrive back from the continent, and lay eggs in April and May for a new generation of Britishborn specimens. Like the red admiral species, these butterflies are rare some years and more abundant in others. </p> <p>Peacock butterflies have been common in the south, but for years penetrated no further north than the Lake District. There are now more reports of them in our county over the last two years. Others in the insect world are being lured from the south to this region.</p> <p>A wildlife friend rang to tell me that hundreds of moths have set up home in the policies of Tynemouth Priory, a historic site on the northeast coast. There are species there already, including the death's-head hawk moth and the red underwing moth. </p> <p>The majority of moths fly by night and are virtually inactive during the day; they must hide because birds hunt by sight. Some moths creep into the grass or hide among thick foliage, a few species with natural camouflage choose to sit in the open, usually on the trunks and branches of trees.</p>",
  "On the road to Koramangala, a group of workmen in hard hats stand staring into a six metre deep hole. A line of cars clogs the tree-lined street, engines idling in the sun. <p>TR Ravichandran drives 40kms each day in and out of Koramangala, the heart of Bangalore and the software capital of India. \"The whole city is coming to a halt,\" said the IT worker. \"My journey to the office used to take 45 minutes, but now lasts two hours. </p> <p>\"My wife works at the southern edge of the city, and she has the same problem. </p> <p>\"When we are leaving home at seven and coming home at nine or 10 at night, what chance is there of a decent family life?\" </p> <p>More than 100 firms from outside India, including Microsoft, Google and Reuters, set up offices in Bangalore last year. Hundreds more have farmed out white-collar work such as call centres to Indian companies in the city. Drawn by a booming economy and a temperate climate, a large slice of middle-class India is setting up home in this high-technology hub. The result is that Bangalore is Asia's fastest growing city, albeit one that is unable to cope with the speed of its own progress. </p> <p>Behind the facade of gleaming steel towers, shopping malls and industrial parks, lies a conurbation groaning under traffic jams, power cuts and spiralling property prices. \"We are simply unable to deal with this form of rapid urbanisation. There are 60,000 unfilled potholes on Bangalore's roads, and yet we are seeing more and more families in the city with two cars. This kind of development is not sustainable,\" said Abdul Aziz, a professor and former member of the planning board of Karnataka, the southern state of which Bangalore is the capital. </p> <p>The city's software industry will this year bring in the equivalent of \u00a33.3bn in revenue; it has become increasingly concerned and vocal that its future cash flow is disappearing because of inaction by the state and city governments. </p> <p>Mike Weston, managing director of Logica, a British software company, warned reporters last week that Bangalore's infrastructure was \"deteriorating\" with potentially disastrous results. </p> <p>Another multinational, Philips, said there was a dire need for an international airport and a new railway. \"[Instead] we have no projects and no results here,\" said the head of the company's Bangalore operations, Bob Hoekstra. </p> <p>Critics point out that although it is nearly five months since state elections, the state government has yet to decide who is going to be the IT minister - when Bangalore accounts for nearly half of the India's hi-tech exports. A Congress coalition retained control of the state and hence city, in voting which reflected national issues. </p> <p>To escape what they see as state government indifference and run-down infrastructure, many \"new economy\" companies have built their own campuses on the southern fringes of the city. </p> <p>Far from the Bangalore's crowded narrow streets and alleys, there are wide empty roads, stand-alone water tanks, back-up generators, and back-ups for the back-ups. </p> <p>The gleaming 28 hectare campus of Infosys, a \u00a31bn IT company, in the south of the city has a golf green, basketball courts, a Domino's Pizza and four staff canteens. Work is being completed on the site's 41st office building, and another 10,000 workers will join this year. </p> <p>But the industry says it cannot indefinitely insulate itself from the city's shortcomings. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, India's richest man, Azim Premji, warned that his company, Wipro, would move work outside the city because of \"quality of life issues\". </p> <p>\"I can't have my employees sitting in traffic when they should be in the office. The government needs to act to sort these things out. Frankly it is embarrassing when there are power cuts during one hour of discussion with clients,\" he said. </p> <p>City administrators say that Bangalore is a victim of its own success. MK Shankarlinge Gowda, the senior civil servant in the information technology ministry, points out that a decade ago Bangalore was a city of 2 million people with a million vehicles, whereas today it has a population of 6m and 3m vehicles. \"These are the problems of being perhaps too successful. But we are doing what we can for all the people in the city. IT companies could themselves help by building housing for their workers near their offices.\" </p> <p>Campaigners however say that the problem lies not with industry or government but with the state's citizens. </p> <p>Ramesh Ramanathan is a former Wall Street banker who returned to Bangalore and set up a civic movement, Janaagraha, with \u00a3500,000 of his own money three years ago, to encourage voters to demand greater accountability and effectiveness from their government. </p> <p>\"The problem here is that there is no civic responsibility for the garbage collection, bad roads, water supply. There are 1m properties in Bangalore, but fewer than half pay taxes. The result is that we collect only 2bn rupees (\u00a324m) in revenue rather than 6bn (\u00a372m).\" </p> <p>Mr Ramathan, who lived in America and Britain for a decade but came back so that his children could get to know their grandparents, says that, in the west, urban democracy works because people demand better services and eject politicians who fail to deliver. With half of India set to live in cities by 2020, he says the need to engage urban voters is urgent. \"Not until people start paying taxes and asking politicians for results will anything change here. And we do not have long in India. </p> <p>\"What Bangalore is experiencing today, the rest of the country will feel tomorrow.\"</p>",
  "<p>This morning Sir Terry Leahy, the chief executive of Tesco, is off to Norway. In the week when the retail colossus he leads has produced eye watering profits - and shown how it is successfully taking the Tesco formula to locations ranging from English suburbia to Shiheung Shihwa in South Korea - it might be assumed he was casting his empire-building eye across the fjords. </p> <p>But he's not. While others might be swilling champagne and indulging in a bit of backslapping to celebrate a splendid week, Leahy really isn't like that. Instead he is flying off to \"do a favour for a mate\" from his university days who now works over there. </p> <p>The man who has led Tesco to its current heights - with 28% of the grocery market, taking \u00a31 out of every \u00a38 spent on the UK high street, with 2,300 stores worldwide and en route to a vast \u00a32bn profit this year - is the most successful retailer in the UK. He is also the polar opposite of the most famous retailer, the flamboyant Philip Green. </p> <p>Leahy brings a whole new meaning to the word deadpan. His face and tone betray no emotion, passion or humour. His critics insist he is an automaton and control freak who is incapable of warmth, small talk or optimism. </p> <p>His restraint was well illustrated with his description of this week's figures showing rocketing sales and profits ahead 28%. While City analysts reached for adjectives like \"excellent\", \"storming\" and \"brilliant\", Leahy selected just plain \"good\" - a word, he explained, that had been alighted upon only after an hour with his most senior colleagues. </p> <p>Lord MacLaurin, Leahy's predecessor in the top seat at Tesco and the man who chose him to take over, is clearly proud of his protege's progress and insists there is a beating heart beneath the uniformly grey suits of the man he calls \"my young Terence\". He adds: \"He is quite a tough guy. You don't immediately warm to him. You've got to get to know him. He does have a good Liverpudlian sense of humour and is an avid Evertonian. But, yes, the first impression is dour.\" </p> <p>Kevin Hawkins, director general of the British Retail Consortium, prefers to quote Churchill. Leahy, he says, \" is a riddle wrapped in mystery inside an enigma\". This week's figures may be Tesco's finest, but Leahy's eyrie says it all about the man at the top. While Tesco's ailing rival Sainsbury occupies a splendid glass and steel office in central London, Leahy's empire is a utilitarian breeze-block sprawl on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. \"The point is,\" says Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the company secretary, \"we don't do swanky at Tesco.\" </p> <p>The tone is set by Sir Terry. The son of a greyhound trainer, brought up in a Liverpool council house, Leahy is a grammar school boy made good and has created a business with the same classless appeal that Marks &amp; Spencer once had. </p> <p>He takes pride in the fact that he can mix with anyone, from any background, with equal ease, despite his almost \u00a33m a year pay packet. But he does admit to being more comfortable with his staff and shoppers than the Whitehall mandarins and City glitterati he also has to deal with. \"You are always most comfortable with the people you have grown up with,\" he says. \"I grew up with the kind of people who work in our stores.\" </p> <p>MacLaurin describes Leahy as \"a team player\", while Neville-Rolfe insists he is \"very much the leader\". Leahy says he can't explain his own management style. \"I don't really analyse myself. I'm challenging, but hopefully in a helping way. I try to establish codes of behaviour and values for the business, and I deal with issues, not personalities\". </p> <p>Leahy spurns all big boys' toys, and while many of his often less successful counterparts glide around in chauffeur-driven luxury, he drives himself to work and around the country for his unannounced Friday store-checking sessions. </p> <p>\"He is among the shrewdest of operators, but he is a modest and unassuming guy,\" says Hawkins. \"I would think the idea of building a big yacht would leave him cold. And the thought of him getting involved in pro bono publico stuff to get into the House of Lords would equally leave him cold.\" </p> <p>He is accused of being standoffish because he gets involved in none of the usual out-of-hours businessmen's activities, like high-profile support for the arts, government task forces, or part-time directorships of other companies. </p> <p>All true, he says, but that is because his family comes first. \"I got this job when we had young children, and there has to be a balance. And my wife is a working professional.\" (She is an NHS doctor). </p> <p>Leahy's first job out of college was as a management trainee at the Co-Op. Colleagues from those days remember him as being a rather harder worker than his peers. He quit to follow his girlfriend to London and landed a job with Tesco. That was 1979, when Ian MacLaurin had already started to revitalise what had become a shabby and downmarket chain. </p> <p>Leahy's talent was spotted, and by the age of 25 he was marketing manager. MacLaurin says he was pinpointed as a possible boss at an early stage. \"He was one of four or five young people we were looking at. They are all on the board now </p> <p>Others remember his aggression, and Leahy now admits he was probably too confrontational. \"I used to be young,\" he explains, \"and I'm Irish, so it was probably fairly predictable. But you grow up, and learn how to motivate people.\" </p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, under the guidance of MacLaurin and his \"Operation Checkout\" strategy, Tesco rebuilt its business and reputation, moving its image upmarket and its stores out of town. Sainsbury's, then the UK's number one grocery retailer, was in its sights. </p> <p>But the recession of the early 1990s took its toll and the company for a while looked clueless about how to get back on track. It was then that Leahy, by then marketing director, had what he has since called his \"crikey moment\", when he realised what was wrong and how to fix it. The problem, he decided, was that they had been trying to be too much like Sainsbury's and had forgotten to put customers first, as Tesco's founder Jack Cohen had with his\"pile-it-high-and-sell-it-cheap\" retail philosophy. </p> <p>Leahy's first reaction was a new Value line of cheap basics, and then he gave us the Tesco Clubcard, derided by Sainsbury's as \"electronic green shield stamps\". But it worked wonders, and is a sophisticated marketing tool. </p> <p>Tesco now knows its customers like no other retailer: what they eat and drink, the drugs they take, the size of their boots and bras. By 1995 Tesco had passed Sainsbury's at the top of the supermarket league, and two years later MacLaurin passed the baton to Leahy. He is pleased with his choice. \"He hasn't gone and invested in stupid things,\" he said. </p> <p>What Leahy has done is take Tesco into fashion, entertainment and electricals. He has targeted services - mobile phones and insurance - and built the biggest online grocery business in the world. He has also taken Tesco to 11 new countries, in eastern Europe and Asia. </p> <p>He knows he is walking a tightrope on just how big Tesco can grow before the public turns against it. He tells the City that taking 12.5p out of every \u00a31 spent in the UK leaves him another 87.5p to go for. But competition watchdogs have acknowledged that Tesco's market share could already justify a monopoly investigation. \"It could happen,\" he says. \"We have to be prepared.\" </p> <p>He also has to keep expanding into new areas; more clothing and homewares, maybe mortgages, maybe cars. And he has to keep rolling out abroad: China is next on the radar. </p> <p>So what will be his next trick? After he has popped up at the odd Downing Street do, there are those who see him in a quasi-political role. He was once tipped as next head of the NHS. </p> <p>Leahy finds it all a bit embarrassing, insisting his ideas are \"nothing grand,\" and that his focus is Tesco, Tesco ... and Tesco. MacLaurin is more forthright. The prospect of his Terence switching careers, he laughs, \"is about as likely as me climbing Everest tomorrow\". </p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong> Sir Terence Patrick Leahy</strong> </p> <p><strong> Born </strong> February 28 1956 </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> St Edward's College, Liverpool; Umist </p> <p><strong> Family</strong> Married with three children </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> Tesco marketing executive, 1979; marketing manager, 1981; marketing director, 1984-86; commercial director of fresh foods, 1986-92; marketing director, 1992-95 (appointed to board); deputy managing director, 1995-97; chief executive, 1997- </p> <p><strong> Other interests </strong> Chancellor, Umist; director, Liverpool Vision (an urban regeneration company), and Everton FC </p> <p><strong> On his early years</strong> \"My brothers all left school at 16, but my parents worked very hard so that I could stay on and do my A-levels\"</p>",
  "<p>You wait your whole life to meet a beautiful and glamorous woman with an exhaustive knowledge of pop history, and then three come along at once. The Concretes - so called because their hometown of Stockholm has a lot of the stuff - were formed in 1999 when school friends Lisa Milberg and Maria Eriksson met Victoria Bergsman at art school, and the three bonded over a shared love of clothes and rock'n'roll. \"When it was us three girls we did rockabilly songs,\" says Milberg, the band's drummer and its most vocal member. \"Mainly because we liked the look of the 50s. We used to look great, and rockabilly songs are extremely easy, which was another good thing, considering how crap we were. Then we got better and the boys came along.\" </p> <p>Maria Eriksson, who plays guitar for the eight-piece band, cannot be with us today as the interview clashes with her brunch hour, so fellow guitarist Daniel Varjo takes her place. The supremely confident Milberg holds court, but singer and songwriter Bergsman is so shy that forcing her to talk begins to feel rather sadistic after a while. Both, however, clearly get a great deal of pleasure from making Varjo own up to the fashion follies of his youth. \"I really liked Motley Crue, Guns N'Roses, Poison, Hanoi Rocks ... all the heavy metal bands from Los Angeles in the 1980s who wore a lot of makeup.\" </p> <p>\"Tell him about your appearance,\" commands Milberg, causing Bergsman to giggle. \"I had long hair in a ... I think it is called a permanent,\" he says with the resigned air of a man used to such treatment. \"I started playing guitar after I got the perm. In fact, there was a Swedish pop-metal band called Europe that had a hit with a song called The Final Countdown. It was the solo in that song that made me start playing the guitar.\" </p> <p>\"That was much more information than I needed to know,\" says Milberg, shaking her head. \"You should stop now.\" But Milberg has started something she cannot finish. \"Actually, the guitar solo in The Final Countdown was pretty hard,\" Varjo reflects. \"I never managed to play it properly. Perhaps now, after all these years, I could do it. We really should include it at our next show in London.\" </p> <p>It's unlikely, though, that the girls are going to allow Varjo to steer the Concretes in a new perm-metal direction. Their debut album is filled with bright, romantic pop songs with touches of the Velvet Underground in their softer moments, and the three original members have a very clear idea about what they want. They had full control over the making of the album, from the way it was recorded to the cover artwork, and the girls - even, occasionally, the reserved Bergsman - are very enthusiastic about the music they like. \"I have been into every musical scene there is over the years,\" she says. \"But I have always been fond of singers with big voices, like Roy Orbison.\" </p> <p>\"I think I grew up in the wrong time,\" says Milberg. \"It made me really sad that I only liked music by dead guys because I never felt like a proper teenager. I was always crazy about Crosby, Stills and Nash, and Neil Young. and the Band ... all the 70s musicians that your parents would like.\" </p> <p>Bruce Springsteen's Greetings From Asprey Park is Varjo's favourite record. \"My parents are divorced, and my dad listened to Born in the USA in the car when he came to pick me up,\" he says. \"I had to buy all the records by Springsteen after that, and he is really great ... much better than his image suggests.\" </p> <p>Milberg and Bergsman are evangelical about a Brighton-based all-female band called Electrelane. \"They have a song called The Valleys which, if there was any justice in the world, would change the way music was made,\" says Milberg. \"It's a long time since I have heard something so innovative. The girl who writes the songs plays saxophone, organ, guitar, piano, and she sings. You are not meant to be able to play that many different instruments! On The Valleys they have a huge choir, and it sounds like 50 guys singing their hearts out.\" </p> <p>Milberg runs a club in Stockholm that specialises in gentle music by singer-songwriters of the 60s and 70s, and one of the bands she plays there is the obscure but cultish Welsh 70s duo Young Marble Giants. \"I am obsessed with two things: them and Robert Wyatt,\" she explains. \"There is very little going on in their music - just a drum machine, some strange sounds and the woman's singing - but it is remarkable. They recorded everything in their home and it sounds timeless.\" </p> <p>\"Too bad we don't have any records by the Modern Lovers here, as they are my favourite band,\" says Bergsman suddenly. \"And I really love Tim Hardin.\" She looks as if she might build on this statement, but instead she returns to her natural state of silence. \"We all like soul music,\" offers Varjo. \"Everybody likes soul music,\" counters Milberg dismissively. \"It is against the law not to. It is called 'soul', after all - and everybody has a soul.\" </p> <p>Sweden has a very enlightened attitude towards music, which might help explain why the country produces so many bands. Everybody is entitled to free music tuition; there are youth clubs with electric guitars and turntables, and most of the population has some degree of proficiency in at least one instrument. In such an environment, soul music is everywhere. Milberg's favourite soul track is Walking Up a One-Way Street by Willie Tee. \"This is the second-best song ever written,\" she announces. What is the first? \"Something's on Your Mind by Karen Dalton. She only made two records, and she didn't like singing so she had to be tricked into going into the recording studio. They told her that they weren't going to release anything she made, which was of course a lie. She has a husky but high-pitched voice that a lot of people don't like, but it is wonderful.\"</p>",
  "Two hundred fraudulent auctions happen every day on the eBay website in Britain, a consumer group claimed yesterday, as it warned the millions of Britons who use internet auction sites to beware. <p>Sarah Kidner, of Which? Computing magazine, told the Evening Standard: \"That figure will only get higher as more and more people use the site.\" </p> <p>Examples of fraud include the sale of counterfeit items and the attempted theft of personal details. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police warned auction site users to pay for goods on delivery, rather than send cash in advance. </p> <p>Ms Kidner said: \"We are not telling people to avoid these websites, but what we are say ing is read the guidelines and make sure you are covered if something goes wrong.\" </p> <p>eBay said just 0.01% of transactions ended in confirmed fraud. Gareth Griffiths, the head of trust and safety at eBay UK, said: \"We have lots of systems in place to drive the number of fraudulent transactions down. </p> <p>\"We try to solve the problem at source, but [are] constantly telling people to use the same common sense they would use in any other environment.\" </p> <p>The site, which has 9 million registered UK users, advises buyers to read feedback from other buyers about sellers, and to contact them through the site with any questions. It also has compensation arrangements for users who are left out-of-pocket because of fraud.</p>",
  "<p>Stalling export orders have stunted the recovery in the country's manufacturing sector, the CBI said yesterday, warning that companies' profits were under pressure from rising oil prices. </p> <p>The group's latest monthly survey of manufacturing, which accounts for less than a fifth of the economy, showed that 24% of companies said orders were below normal while 18% said they were above normal. The resultant balance of -6 compares with last month's six-year high of +2. </p> <p>That chimes with official data on manufacturing output which has shown two consecutive monthly falls suggesting the nascent recovery in the sector may be running out of steam because of a strong pound and weaker export markets, particularly in the United States. </p> <p>The CBI's export orders balance dropped to -14 in September from -8 in August, its lowest since February. </p> <p>\"Although order books weakened this month, the results compare favourably with the position over the past 10 years. However, profit margins will remain under pressure,\" said Ian McCafferty, the CBI's chief economic adviser. </p> <p>\"The manufacturing recovery seems to be stuck in a low gear. It is continuing but the pace has been volatile in recent months, which suggests a degree of uncertainty among manufacturers,\" he added. </p> <p>The CBI said that companies, faced with soaring input costs in the form of high oil prices and surging commodities prices, especially metals, were still struggling to put up prices. The prices balance remained positive but fell back to +7 in September from +11 in August. \"This ... suggests that the manufacturing sector is still expanding, but struggling to make headway in the face of higher interest rates, strong oil prices and at least a temporary slowdown in global growth,\" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. </p> <p>Oil prices, which had fallen back sharply after hitting record highs a month ago, have been rising again in recent days as Hurricane Ivan has disrupted oil supplies. Yesterday Brent crude futures hit a fresh record high of $45.35. </p> <p>The CBI survey also showed that firms were scaling back their expectations of production in the coming months. The output expectations balance slid to +12 from +19 in August, as companies had built up stocks in the past couple of months and needed to run them down again. </p> <p>Analysts said that the CBI survey was not sufficient on its own to alter the Bank of England's interest rate stance. The Bank has raised rates five times since November to 4.75%, though rates are now considered to be at or close to a peak. </p> <p>The much larger services sector has kept the economy afloat in recent years while manufacturing has been in the doldrums. Manufacturing has shed more than a million jobs since 1997 and employment in the sector is down to 3.36m, the lowest since comparable records began in 1978. </p> <p>Separately, the Office for National Statistics said that car production in the three months to August was a seasonally adjusted 4.3% lower than the same period a year earlier.</p>",
  "<p>A humiliating Champions League debut seen from the bench, a dressing-room revolt, and a manager who walked after just four matches, to be replaced by the goalkeeping coach. Michael Owen must be wondering what he has let himself in for. And that despite almost certainly being unaware of his own central role in events that, with admirable restraint, he describes as \"strange\". </p> <p>If only David Beckham, or even Steve McManaman, had warned him. For, while Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho lost the players, much of Madrid's ills, including fractious relations, have far deeper roots - the product of a presidential policy obsessed with marketing, trained only on the gal\u00e1cticos . One that, unbeknownst to him, made Owen, the latest star-signing, the eye of the storm. </p> <p>Two defeats hardly constitute a full-on crisis, but such reverses as that dished out by Bayer Leverkusen are not new; and neither are the circumstances that sparked Camacho's resignation. \"My team-mates assured me that it's not always like this,\" Owen said. He should treat such information with caution. </p> <p>After all, there have been uprisings before and last season Madrid - the white angels, the loudly self-proclaimed greatest club in the world - won nothing at all (and registered a club-record-five successive defeats). And while president Florentino P\u00e9rez leapt eagerly upon Carlos Queiroz for a scapegoat, his autocratic model was pernicious and Madrid's problems profound. </p> <p>A bruising club legend, Camacho was central to P\u00e9rez's summer election campaign, his brilliantly engineered political saviour, the man who would impose discipline and bring down the capricious, bloated superstar image that infuriated fans. A culture that spawned white hankies, jeers and even last season an indiscriminate 30-foot banner reading: \"For you, whores and money, for us indignation.\" But, handily for P\u00e9rez, it was one that shifted attention to players and coach. </p> <p>He said it couldn't happen with Camacho. But despite apparent changes, the internal circumstances have repeated themselves. Camacho represented Madrid's PR-driven managerial ideal type. But the model has changed four times in three years: from the understated, old-school psychology of Vicente Del Bosque, to the modernity, low profile and worldly charm of Queiroz, to the raw tub-thumping of Camacho, and now, with Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem \u00f3n, back to Del Bosque, moustache and all. </p> <p>Camacho was never likely to succeed, too blunt, too domineering to win over a dressing room used to power. Nonetheless, the player power influence needs some deflating, even if it was the detonator this time; it is but a product of the unique way Madrid is run and Camacho's relationship with P\u00e9rez was little better. </p> <p>Already a difficult environment to enter, harder still to withstand, Madrid was more complicated by Owen's arrival. Another superstar, yet different this time; even P\u00e9rez didn't seem as enamoured as usual. He had turned him down earlier, but would never - never, never, never - let a summer pass without the obligatory gal\u00e1ctico, returning to the Liverpool striker as other doors closed. </p> <p>Compensation came with the price, just \u00a38m, a Ballon d'Or , and his nationality; Beckham had shown Madrid how lucrative the English market could be. A deal with BP followed. </p> <p>But if P\u00e9rez wasn't totally convinced, Camacho, who wanted Patrick Vieira, was even less so. It wasn't that he didn't rate Owen, but he couldn't find him a place. How could he drop Ronaldo or Ra\u00fal? And he'd promised Fernando Morientes time on the pitch. It dawned on Camacho, a man who demands control, that apparent change was illusory; like Queiroz and Del Bosque, his hands were tied. From all sides. </p> <p>Previous gal\u00e1cticos had roles to play; Owen's arrival posed a threat to Madrid's core - to their captain Ra\u00fal and existing stars - bringing to the boil simmering discontent. It is emphatically not about Owen personally or professionally, however, but what he represents. And with his linguistic limitations, the new boy was both blameless and surely ignorant of his centrality. \"Obviously I don't know all their conversations because of the language problem,\" he admits. </p> <p>Some senior foreign players were irritated that Owen remained a sub while Ra\u00fal continued to perform poorly, but when the Englishman immediately leapfrogged the eternally shunted Morientes in the substitutes' queue and then, against Espanyol, replaced the captain, the touchpaper was truly lit. </p> <p>Camacho was accused by a faction comprising Guti, Ra\u00fal and Morientes of bowing to media and marketing pressure. And when the coach discovered they had run to P\u00e9rez, who did not defend him, he walked, lamenting that until culture and priorities change Madrid will ever be thus. The news that Adidas had complained about Beckham being dropped merely confirmed Camacho's belief - and illustrated just what Michael Owen has walked into. Welcome to Real Madrid.</p>",

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For energy-saving tips, information about what energy grants are available and the opportunity to complete a free DIY Home Energy Check questionnaire, contact the Energy Saving Trust (<a href=\"http://www.est.org.uk/myhome,\">www.est.org.uk/myhome,</a> tel: 0845 727 7200). If you want to speak to a local energy adviser, or to receive the questionnaire in the post, call your local Energy Efficiency Advice Centre on 0800 512 012. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Remember that \"fuel poverty\" kills. Generally defined as when a household needs to spend 10% or more of its income on fuel costs, it is estimated that up to three million people in the UK are now classified as being \"fuel poor\". And, according to the NHS, around a third of the 30,000 deaths caused by wintry weather each year are due to respiratory diseases or strokes that are exacerbated by poorly heated homes. The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group warned this year that a 10% price hike - as has recently been witnessed - could push an extra 500,000 people into fuel poverty. However, Warm Front grants (also known variously as Warm Deal, Warm Home and Home Energy Efficiency Scheme grants, depending on where you live) are available to help with the costs of insulating your home. If you think you qualifiy for assistance, visit <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/\">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/</a> energy/hees, or contact your local Energy Efficiency Advice Centre. And to see whether you've got the best energy deal for your area and circumstances, visit a cost comparison site such as <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/Energy\">www.uswitch.com/Energy</a> or <a href=\"http://www.savemoneynow.co.uk/x_energy.htm\">savemoneynow.co.uk/x_energy.htm</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you're thinking about installing a renewable energy source for your home investigate what grants you could be entitled to. The government's Clear Skies initiative (<a href=\"http://www.clear-skies.org,\">www.clear-skies.org,</a> tel: 08702 430 930) aims to help householders and communities \"realise the benefits of renewable energy by providing grants and access to sources of advice\". Householders can obtain grants of between \u00a3500 and \u00a35,000, depending on what technology they install. And it's not just limited to solar panels and wind turbines. Wood-fuelled boiler systems (not log-burning stoves or Agas), for example, which typically cost \u00a34,500 for a 15kWth system, can qualify for a \u00a31,500 grant. Hydro turbines and ground-source heat pumps also qualify for grants. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For further advice about installing a renewable energy system at home, contact the National Energy Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.natenergy.org.uk,\">www.natenergy.org.uk,</a> tel: 01908 665555) and the Centre for Alternative Technology (<a href=\"http://www.cat.org.uk,\">www.cat.org.uk,</a> tel: 01654 705950).

  "It's three party British politics. <p>That's been the real lesson of this year.</p> <p>Take those local elections.</p> <p>Big Liberal Democrat gains.</p> <p>Taking on and trouncing Labour in places like Cardiff and Cambridge, Liverpool and Newcastle;</p> <p>Making big gains from them in Leeds and Manchester as well.</p> <p>While in most of these places the Conservatives just simply disappeared.</p> <p>You know it is telling indeed that the voters did not think it worthwhile electing a single Conservative councillor in a place like Oxford.</p> <p>And if you take Scotland and Wales into account and they're scarcely a national UK political party any longer.</p> <p>And Liberal Democrats continued making gains from the Conservatives in places like Portsmouth, St Albans and Watford.</p> <p>In his first speech as the new Liberal Democrat Leader in Newcastle - after thirty years of one party Labour rule - this is what Peter Arnold had to say: -</p> <p>\"For Newcastle Liberal Democrats, one of the most important success criteria will be the extent to which we are able to give the city back to the people...We will be doing things differently, by making sure the Council is less politically partisan and more inclusive. We will be offering Opposition Groups the opportunity to adopt a more positive role in the council's affairs.\"</p> <p>Now there's the difference for you - in a nutshell.</p> <p>As that onetime Liberal, Winston Churchill, put it: \"In victory - magnanimity.\"</p> <p>That's the breath of fresh air that we bring to British politics - and to local communities with it.</p> <p>That's why we're on the move.</p> <p>And that's why we pushed Labour into third place for the first time ever in a national election.</p> <p>Add to those the European elections results.</p> <p>We stuck firmly to our reforming pro-European principles.</p> <p>And the outcome?</p> <p>Two more Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament. </p> <p>Fiona Hall in the North East.</p> <p>And Saj Karim in the North West.</p> <p>Saj - our first ever elected Liberal Democrat parliamentarian from an ethnic minority community.</p> <p>And about time too.</p> <p>But not unique for long.</p> <p>In Leicester South - just as in Brent East last year - we leapfrogged the Conservatives - we came from third place to take on Labour and win.</p> <p>Congratulations, Parmjit Gill.</p> <p>And never forget we came within an ace of doing the same in Birmingham Hodge Hill as well.</p> <p>Well done, Nicola Davies.</p> <p>So fantastic results. Each and every one.</p> <p>And when you leave Bournemouth make sure that your next stop is Hartlepool.</p> <p>That's where I'm heading next.</p> <p>Immediately after this speech.</p> <p>Lembit Opik is flying me there.</p> <p>I kid you not.</p> <p>Greater love hath no man for our party than his is prepared to place his life in Lembit's safe keeping in the skies above us.</p> <p>So I expect to see you all there in Hartlepool. Well, I really do hope to see you all there in Hartlepool!</p> <p>We are the challengers.</p> <p>The Conservatives have already conceded they aren't in the Hartlepool race. </p> <p>And it's a simple statement of fact that the Conservatives are now out of the race in most of urban Britain. </p> <p>And that the only effective challenge to Labour is coming from the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>People know we've done it before - and we can do it again in Hartlepool.</p> <p>If we go out there and make our case - make no mistake.</p> <p>We CAN do it. </p> <p>I want to talk to you today about the future.</p> <p>The future of two things.</p> <p>The future of our party.</p> <p>And also the future of our country.</p> <p>We want the two increasingly to go hand in hand.</p> <p>We know we can make the political weather - tuition fees, the council tax.</p> <p>And we know we're capable of much more yet.</p> <p>But our success also poses certain questions - and rightly so. </p> <p>Are these people up to it?</p> <p>Are those Liberal Democrats ready for the task in hand?</p> <p>Can we be sure we know what they stand for?</p> <p>Well we stand for three things above all else.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust. </p> <p>Those are our watchwords.</p> <p>Those are the core principles against which our policies must be measured. </p> <p>And they are the principles which match the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st century Britain.</p> <p>A Britain now of many faiths, many colours, many languages;<br> A variety of family structures; <br> Far greater life expectancy. <br> And working patterns our grandparents would scarcely recognise. <br>Social mobility and fast communications; High aspirations and far less deference; <br>Openness and tolerance about sexual orientation.</p> <p>A Britain where the individual counts for so much </p> <p>But still a Britain where a sense of community matters. </p> <p>In so many ways that's a liberal Britain.</p> <p>It's our task now to turn these instinctively liberal attitudes into positive votes for the party of British liberal democracy.</p> <p>And it is also a Britain in which the way we are governed is being transformed. </p> <p>We have a Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, both elected by fairer votes - involving proportional representation.</p> <p>And -on November 4th people in the North East will have a referendum for a regional assembly. We're out campaigning hard for that - and I'll be back on that campaign trail again shortly.</p> <p>Devolution is at its best when it gets things done. And it's getting things done that show people what we value and what we stand for.</p> <p>It's been a big responsibility for us, in Wales, where we helped bring much needed stability to the Assembly at a crucial moment - and better policies as a result.</p> <p>Reduced class sizes; more environmental initiatives; free school milk; Free admission to art galleries and museums, recognising that the legacy and the vitality of Celtic culture demands the decision-makers to understand not just the price of things but also the value of things.</p> <p>As a result - people know more about what we stand for. And they're voting accordingly.</p> <p>Impressive gains this year in Cardiff, Bridgend and Swansea - and so many other places across the country.</p> <p>And in Wales we carry on pushing for an extension to the law making powers of the Assembly - that has to be the next logical and necessary step forward.</p> <p>And in Scotland where the partnership there has been delivering on many of our top priorities;</p> <p>Free personal care for the elderly - delivered.</p> <p>Abolishing tuition fees - delivered.</p> <p>Fair votes for local government elections - being delivered. </p> <p>But it doesn't stop there.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland have set the new agenda for devolution. </p> <p>A Scottish agenda that deals with long-term challenges - like poor health; the environment; the need to improve education, the foundation for an enterprising country.</p> <p>New legislation announced by Jim Wallace just this month to provide free eye and dental checks for all.</p> <p>And a new Environment Bill announced by Ross Finnie so that a green thread runs through the heart of Scottish government, one where every policy will be audited for its environmental impact.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats getting things done. </p> <p>And demonstrating how our approach - every time - is rooted in freedom, fairness and trust. </p> <p>I've done a lot of travelling across Britain this year.</p> <p>And with it a lot of listening.</p> <p>I listened to the students on campus in Plymouth, worried about their steadily deepening debts and how on earth they would ever escape them.</p> <p>I listened to the young mother in a Leicester shop, troubled that teachers are not getting the time to teach her children properly.</p> <p>I listened to the Asian grandmother in Huddersfield, who told me about being genuinely afraid, for the first time in over thirty years in her local community, because of the growth of mindless racism among an unrepresentative few.</p> <p>And then the high street traders in Birmingham, utterly sick and tired of senseless vandalism against their properties.</p> <p>And their local customers, equally scared about street violence and the threat of crime as it affects them personally.</p> <p>The pensioners in Exeter - bitter about their dwindling resources, confused about losing their pension books, unhappy about the level of pensions themselves and angry about seemingly never-ending council tax rises.</p> <p>And to the doctor in Norwich, expressing his sheer frustration at the remote, command and control from London which characterises so much of this government's mismanagement of our National Health Service.</p> <p>And then the school pupils in Cardiff, thinking aloud about pollution and climate change - uncertain about the environment they would inherit.</p> <p>This is our Britain today; these are typical of people's concerns.</p> <p>Well, if you seek to lead, first you must listen.</p> <p>People have a huge desire to be listened to; for politicians to take the time to understand their problems.</p> <p>And address those problems with solutions.</p> <p>It is we Liberal Democrats that are now providing the answers.</p> <p>For students - when the pupil aspires to become the student, we would encourage and enable them - by stopping tuition fees and axing top-up fees - one of the most socially retrograde acts of this government, when what Britain needs is a university system affordable to all.</p> <p>For parents - we will equip children for life - because children well cared for and well taught in their early years have a far better chance of success.</p> <p>So we will reduce class sizes for the youngest children and give teachers time to teach and children time to learn by abolishing unnecessary tests and red tape.</p> <p>And we would ensure that every child, in every classroom, in every school is taught by a qualified teacher in the relevant subject.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For those in fear of racism - first, a real lead from politicians - celebrating the fact that our country is better, it's richer and more diverse, precisely because it is a multicultural society.</p> <p>And that we have been prepared to stand out and if necessary alone in having no truck with short-term, knee-jerk responses to complex social issues.</p> <p>That we won't pander to the lowest common denominator over asylum and immigration. But we'll reform the systems - to make them fairer and faster.</p> <p>And that we respect people's genuine religious and cultural identities at community level. </p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On Crime - 10,000 more police on the streets and cutting the time spent on paperwork, so they can spend more time tackling drug dealers, muggers and yobs.</p> <p>Use prison as an opportunity to educate in the basics - numeracy, literacy - so that when they get out people will be far better able to find work and far less likely to reoffend.</p> <p>And for the victims of crime open up the courts so that they can confront the offenders - and speed up the system of compensation as well.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For pensioners - we will continue - to make and win the case for axing the unjust, unfair, increasingly unworkable council tax.</p> <p>And its replacement by a fair, local income tax - based on people's ability to pay.</p> <p>We'll stop the scandal of elderly people having to pay for their personal care - and probably losing the family home in the process. We would deliver free long-term care for the elderly.</p> <p>And all pensioners over 75 - the war generation - should be entitled to a pension which lifts them above mean-testing - \u00a3100 extra a month. No-one should be demeaned in their old age anymore.</p> <p>And this specific pledge to women, who have long been discriminated against because of the way the pension system works. </p> <p>For the first time you will be treated equally.</p> <p>For the first time you will have a pension in your own right.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On health - We would put patients first and free doctors and nurses from Whitehall meddling. Liberal Democrats would hack away the red tape, abolish the absurd targets and free our frustrated doctors and nurses. </p> <p>Let the local community and the local doctors and local nurses make the decisions. They are far better placed to get them right. </p> <p>And more emphasis than ever before should be placed on prevention of ill health and promotion of healthy lifestyles. We truly need a health and not just a sickness service.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On the environment - our determination to make the environment count at every level of Government means thinking green in every area.</p> <p>Yes, it's big picture stuff - from the food chain to climate change, energy to trade, aviation to sustainable international development.</p> <p>Britain can't do this alone. The Prime Minister is right to use our presidency of the EU and the G8 next year to press for consensus.</p> <p>But if we can lead by example, if we can achieve our Kyoto targets ahead of time, we can encourage other countries to sign up.</p> <p>If we can deliver 20% of our electricity needs through renewable energy by 2020, that would be leading by example.</p> <p>Take air travel - which is fast become the world's biggest polluter.</p> <p>We should be shifting taxes on aviation away from the passenger and onto the plane itself which does the polluting.</p> <p>Now that would be leading by example too, encouraging better fuel efficiency and therefore less pollution.</p> <p>But quality of life actually begins at home - it's in your street, around your community.</p> <p>And our approach to the environment must begin there too.</p> <p>The green thread that should run through all aspects of government, should run through all aspects of our lives also.</p> <p>So more park and ride schemes for our towns and cities - cutting pollution in our streets.</p> <p>More local recycling initiatives - showing how all of us can make that difference within our own homes.</p> <p>Cutting waste - reusing - improving.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>Because that's what these - and many more - policies are rooted in.</p> <p>Policies designed to create more freedom.</p> <p>Based on social fairness.</p> <p>Not bogus, false choices - designed to distract.</p> <p>But real, quality local choice - designed to deliver.</p> <p>And it's all underpinned by economic fairness as well.</p> <p>This is crucial to our credibility and critical to our success.</p> <p>From the outset, I have insisted that we have the most watertight set of tax and expenditure proposals possible. </p> <p>We want to tax more fairly and spend more wisely.</p> <p>Isn't it a disgrace that after 7 years of a supposedly Labour government the poorest 20% contribute more of their income in tax than do the richest 20%?</p> <p>We don't want the politics of economic envy. But we do want the politics of social equity.</p> <p>What does that mean?</p> <p>It means asking the top 1% of income earners to pay a top marginal rate of tax of 50p for every pound earned above \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>That pays for our immediate commitments to: </p> <p>* Scrap tuition and top-up fees for students;</p> <p>* Introduce free personal care for elderly and disabled people;</p> <p>* And keep down the level of local taxes.</p> <p>But spending on our priorities does not mean higher taxes across the board. It means looking hard as well at how much Government spends and getting value for money for taxpayers.</p> <p>And we've already found further large savings - at least \u00a35bn a year - by cutting back on big, centralised government and redirecting money to priority spending:</p> <p>\u00b7 Dropping plans for identity cards;</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrapping some government departments and relocating others away from high-cost central London;</p> <p>\u00b7 Doing less, better and more efficiently - and concentrating more on what really matters.</p> <p>It is this approach which gives us the credibility to pledge.</p> <p>\u00b7 Axing the \u00a31bn Child Trust Fund, the so called baby bonds scheme, and spending the money now when children need it most, not the state stashing it away until 2022;</p> <p>\u00b7 10,000 more police on the streets - cutting crime and the fear of crime;</p> <p>\u00b7 Making sure that by 2011 Britain finally fulfils its UN obligations by boosting the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of GNP;</p> <p>\u00b7 \u00a325 more on pensions every week for those aged 75 and over with a million pensioners taken off means testing.</p> <p>The figures add up; the balance sheet is balanced. </p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>It is trust that has to underpin everything else.</p> <p>And it's winning public trust that is going to be the biggest challenge of all.</p> <p>Over the course of this parliament one issue more than any other has helped define just what the Liberal Democrats stand for in the minds of millions of our fellow citizens.</p> <p>You know what I'm talking about.</p> <p>And the people know exactly what we've been talking about.</p> <p>From the outset we have provided rational, principled and consistent opposition to the war in Iraq.</p> <p>We've done it without exaggeration. We've done it without name-calling. We've done it - quite simply - because we believed it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Now I believe the vast majority of people have made their minds up - one way or the other.</p> <p>Donald Rumsfeld promised shock and awe.</p> <p>What we got was shock and then steadily increasing horror. </p> <p>The Prime Minister promised action on the Middle East Road Map.</p> <p>What we got was little progress and more violence.</p> <p>There's a sullen, and increasingly angry mood on the issue. And understandably so.</p> <p>Not least when Kofi Annan declares the war illegal.</p> <p>When the Iraq Survey Group is expected to conclude that the WMD were not there.</p> <p>When the Foreign Office warned of the likely disastrous consequences.</p> <p>And when it appears the Government told the Bush administration, a full year before the war started, that it would not budge in its support for their policy of regime change - and yet the Prime Minister told our Parliament and our people that it was all about weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>There is a fundamental question that the Prime Minister has consistently failed to answer.</p> <p>I asked him this in the House of Commons in the run up to war, and again as recently as the 20th of July this year during the debate on the Butler Report.</p> <p>\"Did he advise President Bush privately - long before the United Nations route was formally abandoned - that if the President decided to prosecute an invasion of Iraq, the British would be in active military support, come what may?</p> <p>\"If he did advise the President to that effect, when did such an exchange take place?\"</p> <p>When Parliament next convenes, the Prime Minister must take the first opportunity to come to the Despatch Box and make a full statement. </p> <p>It's time we got an answer. </p> <p>And if the Prime Minister still refuses, the people can make a judgement.</p> <p>There is the ultimate verdict of the general election itself.</p> <p>Lord Hutton did not provide the answer.</p> <p>Nor did Lord Butler.</p> <p>The decision to decline to participate in Lord Butler's enquiry was a tough one at the time.</p> <p>But it was the correct decision as events have proved.</p> <p>And at the end of the day that is what trust in political leadership has to be all about.</p> <p>What trust today in what our leaders told us at the time about Iraq?</p> <p>And what kind of corrosive effect does that have on politics generally?</p> <p>Yet the tragic experience of Iraq should have the opposite effect.</p> <p>And I believe it can.</p> <p>It should galvanise people to participate, to make their views known through the ballot box.</p> <p>It should strengthen all of our resolves to rededicate ourselves to the rebuilding of effective international institutions, to the repairing of shattered alliances among long-standing friends.</p> <p>But within our own country - one lesson must be learned.</p> <p>This country is still crying out for an effective political system that responds to them and listens to the people.</p> <p>More openness. More accountability. Politicians taking responsibility for their decisions.</p> <p>Never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence.</p> <p>Never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the United Nations.</p> <p>Never again must Britain find itself on such a basis so distanced from principal partners within Europe.</p> <p>Never again should our troops find themselves without proper and adequate equipment in a war zone.</p> <p>Never again should such supreme Prime Ministerial power be allowed to progress without sufficient checks and balances.</p> <p>And without the proper operation of collective Cabinet government itself.</p> <p>And never again should a so-called \"official opposition\" be entitled to that name when it so pathetically fails to fulfil its most basic parliamentary function and duty - the provision of constructive and effective questioning of the executive of the day.</p> <p>Never again.</p> <p>But we should not just look back in anger.</p> <p>There is every sign that we need to look forward with increasing anxiety.</p> <p>And that is why the Prime Minister should also take that opportunity to give a cast iron guarantee that the United Kingdom will not support unilateral military action against Iran.</p> <p>You know some commentators will tell you that our recent victories are just the fall out from Iraq.</p> <p>That the Lib Dems are just the protest vote.</p> <p>Well, let's face it. There has been a lot for people to protest about.</p> <p>But we are being seen more and more as a party which does win elections, which does exercise responsible representation, which has become increasingly comfortable with the duties and the disciplines of power.</p> <p>Some also say that you can't go chasing left-wing voters and right-wing voters at one and the same time - while remaining consistent and true to your principles.</p> <p>It is a deeply flawed analysis - based on a fundamental misreading of today's Britain.</p> <p>Why? Because for the vast majority of people who live their lives in an increasingly inter-dependent world, facing increasingly complex issues, for them the old-fashioned nostrums of right and left no longer apply.</p> <p>They're looking for solution-based politics. Politics which address their everyday needs.</p> <p>There is a shift in the way people view politics, one that transcends any single issue.</p> <p>Iraq has been part of this, but by no means is it the whole story.</p> <p>I come across it, day in and day out.</p> <p>People see that the Labour and Conservative agendas are converging.</p> <p>Where as ours is about having the freedom to make the most of our lives.</p> <p>It's about what is fair - taxation based on ability to pay and delivery for all not the few.</p> <p>And that you have to be able to trust your political leaders and your political parties to deliver.</p> <p>There's a deep-rooted sense in our country that somehow all is not quite right.</p> <p>That somehow all is not as we're being told it is. An underlying sense of doubt.</p> <p>Made worse by the fact that people just don't trust this Government.</p> <p>This Government flags up the big, long-term difficult issues - pension provision, funding local services, global warming - but then puts off serious discussion and decisions until safely beyond another general election.</p> <p>But people don't identify with the Conservatives - because that party just doesn't connect with them.</p> <p>They hark back to a Britain that is no more. They're out of touch with the Britain of today.</p> <p>No wonder they fall back on hard-core instincts - and increasingly belongs to all our yesterdays. </p> <p>In huge swathes of the country it's the Conservatives who are now firmly established - as the third party.</p> <p>In so much of the country a vote for the Conservatives is now a wasted vote.</p> <p>The third party - on their third leader in as many years - and a third leader who's just had his third reshuffle in less than a year.</p> <p>Well, they say variety is the spice of life.</p> <p>For the Conservatives it looks to me much more like the kiss of death.</p> <p>They belong to the past. </p> <p>We're working for the future.</p> <p>We are moving from a party of protest to a party of power.</p> <p>3 party politics is here - and here to stay.</p> <p>You know, at times this past year I've felt rather nostalgic.</p> <p>21 years as a Member of Parliament.</p> <p>You learn quite a lot after more than two decades doing any job.</p> <p>Direct personal experience does teach along the way.</p> <p>That's why, whenever I'm asked to speculate - an occupational hazard - I always suggest to people not to waste time on the crystal ball, but instead learn from the history book. </p> <p>It's really quite simple.</p> <p>For the country to believe in a political party - first that party has to believe in itself. </p> <p>We're at our best, we perform best, we persuade best - when we spend our time talking positively about what it is that we have to offer.</p> <p>And we're far more likely to achieve that from a position of principled party independence - not one distracted by noises off.</p> <p>So when people ask me \"Where does your party stand?\" my starting point is not the crystal ball.</p> <p>Instead, it's crystal clear.</p> <p>No nods, no winks, no deals, no stitch ups.</p> <p>If, on polling day at next general election, more people vote Liberal Democrat - then the next day and in the next parliament what you will get are more Liberal Democrats working for more liberal democracy.</p> <p>Not something else.</p> <p>But working all out for better public policies from parliament.</p> <p>Prepared to work with others on issues of principle - like Europe.</p> <p>But not prepared to surrender our essential political independence along the way.</p> <p>That's our Liberal Democrat pledge to the people. </p> <p> So there is a fundamental choice before us all at the next General Election.</p> <p>The British people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>225 days.</p> <p>Then a stark choice. A serious choice.</p> <p>And we, increasingly, are the winning choice.</p> <p>Because all that we say and all that we do is based on those fundamentals.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust</p> <p>That's us.</p> <p>That's what we want from our politics.</p> <p>That's what we stand for.</p> <p>That's what we want our country to stand for.</p> <p>At home - and abroad.</p> <p>That's Liberal Democracy.</p>",
  "<p>A national food policy should be put in place to help combat obesity and improve the environment, the Liberal Democrat conference heard today.</p> <p>Lady Miller, Lib Dem spokeswoman for the environment, food and rural affairs, announced that under a Liberal Democrat government, the first national policy on food would be delivered in Britain, overseen by a dedicated cabinet minister.</p> <p>The policy would not only target nutrition to deflate rising levels of obesity, but also serve the purpose of improving the environment by encouraging greater consumption of local produce.</p> <p>Citing a recent pilot scheme within the Co-op grocery chain, which is labelling foods clearly for consumers and backed up by fair trade policies, Lady Miller said such good practice would become spread nationally under the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>\"It's not just a few of us who are worried,\" she told the conference. \"People have become conscious that something is wrong in a big way. The concern about what to eat and what not to eat is enormous. You are what you eat.\" </p> <p>\"Food for life\" targets would be established to ensure schoolchildren received proper nutrition, including 50% of ingredients being drawn from locally sourced produced.</p> <p>Lady Miller pointed the finger at the Conservative party for the poor diets in today's schools which lead to poor concentration and hyperactivity, after the former government \"cut school dinners, closed school kitchens and sacked school cooks\", she said.</p> <p>\"At a single stroke they turned a generation away from eating a midday meal prepared with prime ingredients into a generation who ate snack food on the run. Vending machines filled the hunger gaps that inevitably appeared and children's moods swung on sugar highs and hunger lows.\"</p> <p>In a bid to increase reliance on local, fresh produce, local authorities would be expected to provide communities with a \"range of retail opportunities\" through planning policy statements. </p> <p>\"Look at our environment,\" Lady Miller said. \"Fertilisers and pesticides polluting rivers in coastal waters. Look at the energy wasted hauling food hundreds or thousands of unnecessary miles.\"</p> <p>Speaking after the debate, delegate Cyd Lee, from Wiltshire and Chippenham branch, said the policy was in touch with the public mood: \"It is workable but it will take some time, because businesses are always very slow to switch on to what the public really, really want.\"</p> <p>Simon Goldie, from Islington, said: \"As an aspiration it is very good because we have such problems in health.\"</p>",
  "The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, risks incurring the wrath of the Labour leadership yet again today when he launches an attack on the party's higher education policies. <p>In a strongly worded foreword to a report on further and higher education in the capital, Mr Livingstone states his \"irrevocable\" opposition to charging students tuition fees of any kind, in contrast to the government's policy of retaining fees and increasing them to up to \u00a33,000 a year from 2006/07.</p> <p>The former Labour MP warns that the plans will price London students out of a university education - the report contains evidence that students from lower socio-economic groups are already being deterred - and will fail to meet the needs of London's high-skill economy.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone, who was this year re-elected as mayor for a second term, this time running on a Labour ticket, makes it clear he has not toned down his opposition to tuition fees despite being re-admitted to the party after a lengthy stand-off with the leadership.</p> <p>In the foreword to the 70-page document he writes: \"Education is a universal human right, vital not only to enable the full development of individuals but also to the existence of a civilised and prosperous community ... The experience of millions has shown that higher education can be the biggest chance an individual has of escaping disadvantage and discrim-ination, and realising their potential for their own - and society's - benefit.\"</p> <p>He continues: \"These are the reasons for my irrevocable policy to reject completely any proposals for tuition fees paid by students or graduates. Like health services, and for many of the same social and economic reasons, higher education should be free at the point of demand.\"</p> <p>His comments come just days before the Labour party conference in Brighton, where backbenchers who voted against the government over top-up fees are likely to underline their concerns about the plans.</p> <p>At a conference to launch the report, World City, World Knowledge, organised by the Greater London authority, Mr Livingstone will outline his commitment to maintaining the capital's position as a global centre of knowledge and highlight the social and economic benefits which higher and further education bring to the city.</p> <p>There are 41 higher education institutions in London, with over a million further and higher education students and more than 65,000 international students.</p> <p>The sector generated nearly \u00a39bn for the UK economy in 2001/02 and created 122,000 full-time jobs.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone has not spoken publicly on fees since last October, when he lent his support to members of the National Union of Students during a protest against top-up fees.</p> <p>In his formal response to the government's white paper in January last year he argued that fear of debt would deter a significant proportion of London's students.</p> <p>Today's report also notes the punitive costs of studying in London: \"Since the govern-ment's reforms in 1998, the costs of being a student in London have risen sharply,\" it says. \"Students graduating from a university in London in 2002/03 were nearly \u00a32,000 more in debt than those graduating from universities outside London.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have developed a jab to stop sheep belches and farts from damaging the environment. </p> <p>Wind from sheep, cows and other farm animals accounts for about 20% of global emissions of methane - a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent, volume for volume, than carbon dioxide. </p> <p>Now a team led by Andr\u00e9-Denis Wright of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Perth, Australia, has devised a vaccine against the microbes that produce methane in sheep rumens. </p> <p>After two injections, sheep burped out 8% less methane in a 13-hour test in a closed chamber. The results appear in the journal Vaccine. </p> <p>The vaccine was effective against 20% of the bugs inside the 20 sheep used in the trial. Scientists are now working to increase this and to cut methane production further. Emissions from farm animals are a particular problem in Australia and New Zealand, where they account for up to 80% of methane produced. </p> <p>Researchers in Britain and other countries have experimented with changing composition of feed to make intensively farmed animals produce less methane. A vaccine would be more useful because it could be given to all ruminants. David Adam</p>",
  "<p>A new superstrain of the flu virus capable of triggering a global pandemic could emerge from east Asia, health officials have warned. </p> <p>Scientists working for the World Health Organisation fear that the arrival of the flu season in Asian countries could see the human flu virus merge with a lethal strain of bird flu that is already in circulation, producing a more deadly flu virus that could rapidly infect humans, leading to a global outbreak.</p> <p>Recent cases of flu in Thailand have been reported in areas already struggling to control the spread of bird flu, a virus that mostly affects poultry, but has claimed the lives of at least four people in recent months.</p> <p>Health officials warn that people living in regions where the viruses are circulating could catch both at once, raising the prospect of a new and highly virulent form of human flu emerging.</p> <p>\"The reality is that if these two viruses meet, they will exchange genetic information and a new virus could emerge that's as pathogenic as the bird flu virus, but as infectious as human flu. It's a real scenario for the emergence of a pandemic,\" Klaus St\u00f6hr, head of the WHO's influenza programme, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Bird flu affected 10 Asian countries last year, killing at least 18 people and tens of millions of birds. It returned this year with outbreaks in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. To prevent people becoming infected with both bird flu and human flu, the WHO recommends that those at greatest risk, such as poultry farmers, be vaccinated against human flu or take antiviral drugs.</p> <p>But with more than 95% of the world's doses of flu vaccine sold to developed countries, stocks in poorer regions are so low that many countries have little, if any, to give out.</p> <p>The Thai health ministry last week said it would try to vaccinate poultry workers in affected areas, but with only 100,000 donated doses of vaccine, local officials admit they do not have enough to prevent both viruses spreading.</p> <p>Writing in New Scientist, Prasert Thongcharoen of Mahidol University in Bangkok, a member of the WHO's expert committee on viral diseases, said: \"We do not have sufficient vaccine to prevent co-circulation.\"</p>",
  "At last. For years, Liberal Democrats have argued and debated over weighty policy documents with next to no media attention devoted to our earnest deliberations. Global trade, the environment, the state of our inner cities, the deterioration of childcare services, pensioner poverty, electoral reform. You name it, we've debated it. Year in, year out, the media would breezily ignore these debates, preferring instead to dwell on eccentric party motions, or spats on the conference fringes, or tedious speculation about the \"equidistance\" (or not) of the party to Labour or the Conservatives. <p>Then along comes the Orange Book. A collection of individual essays from all wings of the party - a fact conveniently forgotten in the subsequent brouhaha - which has sparked intense media interest and anguished internal debate. The breathless accusation levelled at the book is that it represents a \"rightwing\" lurch in Lib Dem thinking. Anyone who's actually read the book couldn't possibly sustain such an allegation, but then again politics is rife with misplaced labels. </p> <p>All this requires some explanation.</p> <p>First, as Lib Dems we're not entirely accustomed to this kind of public interest in our ideas. Whatever one's views, it's great to rediscover the ability to animate politics through a discussion of ideas rather than personality or passing tittle-tattle. Most of the notoriety of the book surrounds David Laws' provocative essay on the NHS. In common with all the other essays, his is a purely personal contribution. It does not represent party policy, as David himself acknowledges. Judging by the reaction of the party this week, I doubt it ever will. But it's a view, however marginal, and holding unpopular views is not a crime in politics. </p> <p>New Labour has its mavericks who disagree with government policy. Frank Field is way out of line with Labour party policy, but his views are still circulated for free and fair discussion. David Curry's views on Europe are fantastically out of step with Conservative party policy, but he still held firmly to them even when he was in the shadow cabinet. We have our mavericks too, and their right to provoke and aggravate discussion should be protected. In turn, they must accept that their views will be viewed as marginal, lone outriders out of step with the necessary party political consensus upon which all parties rely. That's the deal, and it's a fair one.</p> <p>Second, the cynicism of the New Labour attack dogs knows no bounds. Peter Hain has latched blindly on to the Orange Book as evidence for his increasingly shrill assertion that the Lib Dems are crypto-Thatcherites. Ruth Kelly was found yesterday gleefully distributing copies of the book to Labour MPs as if it contained some guilty pornographic secret. Who do they think they're kidding? Earlier in the week, Paul Boateng was yelling that Lib Dem spending commitments are too generous. Blair sneers at what he thinks are our dangerously radical proposals to introduce a new 50% marginal income tax rate on the richest earners in Britain and to scrap the council tax and introduce a new local income tax. These policies and others, like the scrapping of the Department of Trade and Industry, would give us the resources to introduce free personal care for the elderly, remove tuition fees, and provide a big boost to the pensions of those over 75. Rightwing? Do Messrs Hain and Kelly honestly think voters will regard these as Thatcherite? Hardly.</p> <p>Third, and probably most important of all, the yah-boo about the Orange Book has underlined a fact often forgotten. There are different strands of liberalism, much as there are different strands of socialism and conservatism. If there's one common denominator in the different essays in the Orange Book, it's that all the authors struggle with the constant liberal dilemma of balancing state authority with individual liberty, the public and private realms, the power of central (or European) government and democratic accountability. My essay highlighted the need to test the European Union, if necessary critically, against the highest standards of accountable and effective government. Ed Davey unpicks the problem of excessive centralised state power in Britain. Steve Webb ventures into the tricky realm of the boundary between government action and family life. Vince Cable warns against the pitfalls of excessive political interference in the economy.</p> <p>These are enduring themes in liberal thought from the days of Gladstone. Throughout, there is a strong scepticism about the blunt power of the state. Other strands of liberalism might place greater emphasis on social reform, on radical constitutional reform, on the abolition of inherited privilege. But - and this is crucial - these strands are by no means incompatible with each other. Since when was social justice, for instance, incompatible with a smaller state apparatus? Only New Labour believes that Whitehall and Whitehall alone can bring about social change.</p> <p>That's why the Hain/Kelly accusation doesn't work. That's why Charles Kennedy was cast in The Sun as a dangerous \"leftwing\" snake, and by the Daily Mirror as a \"rightwing\" Thatcherite drag queen on the same day. Slowly but surely, it's dawning on people that liberalism has much to offer to voters of different shades of opinion. Politics is the art of ideological balance, not a sect like pursuit of narrow ideological dogma.</p> <p>One final thought: imagine that the Tory party remains a rump party for narrow English prejudices. I don't believe the Tory party will disappear, but it seems incapable of escaping those prejudices to appeal to any more than a hard core of voters; imagine that when Blair steps down, the Labour party sheds some of his appeal to the middle ground, indulging as it will in some traditional Labour posturing; imagine, too, that at the 2005 general election the Lib Dems win a handsome clutch of seats from the Tories and move into strong second place to challenge Labour in seats up and down the country in the next general election in 2009/2010.</p> <p>Ask yourself, then, what the Liberal Democrats will need to win over a sufficiently large swath of public opinion to make important inroads at the next two elections? Answer: a broad appeal to progressive voters in the key expanse of middle opinion in Britain. This week, we have strengthened that broad appeal. There's all to play for.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Nick Clegg is the Liberal Democrats' prospective parliamentary candidate for Sheffield Hallam</p>",
  "<p>The 1,450 employees of the car insurer Admiral stand to gain an average windfall of \u00a339,000 after the company today unveiled details of a stock market flotation.</p> <p>Admiral, the biggest Welsh company to be listed in London, said it was setting the price per share of its initial public offering at 275p, giving the company a market value of \u00a3711m in one of the biggest flotations in the UK this year.</p> <p>Flotation will see almost a third of the company's share capital sold by existing investors. The largest group is Admiral's 1,450 staff, who own about 47% of the company. </p> <p>Executive directors and senior managers will land the biggest windfalls, although Admiral has said even the most junior workers should receive at least \u00a310,000. Most Admiral employees work at call centres in Cardiff and Swansea.</p> <p>Admiral's chief executive, Henry Engelhardt, said the global offer had generated a strong response from institutional investors. </p> <p>\"I'm absolutely thrilled with the outcome,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Engelhardt, who owns 19.6% of the company, stands to make a paper profit of \u00a3139m by selling a fifth of his shares. The driving force behind the flotation has been Barclays Private Equity, the group's biggest shareholder with a 33% stake, to cash in on its investment.</p> <p>Launched as a small start-up in 1993 by the Brockbank group, a subsidiary of XL Capital, Admiral targeted car owners who traditionally pay higher-than-average premiums: young drivers, performance car drivers, people who live in cities or often a combination of all three.</p> <p>Admiral was sold to the management team in 1999 in a buyout backed by Barclays Private Equity. Admiral expanded rapidly through the growth of internet brands including <a href=\"http://www.elephant.co.uk\"> elephant.co.uk</a> and its women's motor insurance company, Diamond. </p> <p>Admiral's listing comes at a time when several other flotations have run into trouble amid nervousness over rising interest rates, oil prices and the unstable situation in Iraq.

  "The Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, gathers in Llandudno today for its annual conference, buoyed by its leadership of the \"Impeach Blair\" campaign, but riven by financial difficulties. <p>The party, which fared badly at the 2003 elections to the Cardiff assembly, is split over its future direction, with former leader Lord Elis-Thomas claiming last week that nationalism was not relevant in a post-devolution world. </p> <p>Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Adam Price will kick off the conference with his bid to put the prime minister on trial over the Iraq war, which has support from 21 MPs and has been endorsed by legal experts. </p> <p>Senior figures are keen to move on from internal debate and concentrate on attacking Labour's record on public services. </p> <p>However, writing in the party's conference brochure, treasurer John Dixon says the party is \"always on the point of crisis\" and that it is currently \u00a346,000 overdrawn.</p> <p>Mr Dixon wrote: \"Whatever we do, we shall always be on the edge of a crisis, because the calls on our resources will always be greater than the amount of resources available.\" </p> <p>Mr Dixon said there had been \"tight financial discipline\" despite two successive years of elections. </p> <p>The party's performance in the 2004 elections - where it lost two out of three councils and fell to third place behind the Tories in the Welsh European polls - showed the party had work to do. </p> <p>\"The eventual outcome in terms of seats was as good as we could have expected,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Slipping to third place behind the Tories was, however, more worrying, and shows that we have more to do to underline our status as the main opposition in Wales. </p> <p>Mr Price will tell the conference he has received legal advice that parliament still has the power to to use the archaic procedure of impeaching a prime minister. </p> <p>He said: \"We have continuously maintained that the prime minister has a case to answer over his conduct in relation to the invasion of Iraq, and now we have the legal opinion to prove we were correct. </p> <p>\"No longer can New Labour say that impeachment is obsolete or can they say that the questions have already been answered. </p> <p>\"As Kofi Annan [the UN secretary general] stated last week, the war in Iraq was both illegal and damaging. For those who are despairing, this opinion, which unlike the government we are publishing in full, will provide a glimmer of hope that justice can be achieved for the thousands of innocent victims of the war, both here in Britain and in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Delegates will also hear from the party's Westminster leader, Elfyn Llwyd, today, and from Ceredigion MP Simon Thomas, who will speak on environment policy. </p> <p>There will be debates on rail services, drug and alcohol abuse and affordable housing. </p> <p>The party's leader in the Welsh assembly, Ieuan Wyn Jones,will address the conference on Friday followed by party president Dafydd Iwan on Saturday.</p>",
  "<p>For two years as a student I lived on Chestnut Avenue in Headingley, Leeds. The street's only claim to fame was that it was once declared the most burgled street in Britain. Two out of three houses were occupied by students. And two of out three were robbed every year. </p> <p>We escaped burglary until the very last term when a lucky robber, wandering past our house let himself in and helped himself to our coats and a video. My bleary-eyed flatmate had left a key in the door after a particularly long night out.</p> <p>For us burglary was a pretty common experience, even if the cause of our own break-in was a little more stupid than others. Sadly the picture is similar across the country: One in three students experiences a crime every year - but two thirds don't report it, according to home office figures released last year. </p> <p>A more recent poll of 2,000 students from 30 universities this year found that a quarter of incidences against students involved criminal damage, 28% involved theft, 22% involved burglary, 13% were assaults, 9% robbery and 3% sexual offences. With freshers week in full force already at some universities, and poised to start next week at others, a whole new crop of vulnerable students will be spilling out onto the campuses </p> <p>Tomorrow, while the freshers are congregating, a conference will take place in London to look at the issue. University security guards, police officers and student union officials will get together to formulate a response to the problem of crime on campuses. They will debate safety in student halls and for black and female students, and how best universities and police can work together to tackle crime. </p> <p>Helen Symons, vice-president of welfare at the National Union of Students, says: \"It's difficult to get the balance between raising the awareness of risk and not freaking them out. </p> <p>\"But students are vulnerable. Students often live in the run-down area of town or in accommodation which isn't properly secured. They might not have nice furniture but they do have portable electronic goods - phones and computers.\"</p> <p>The problem varies greatly from university to university depending on whether said institution is based in the middle of the countryside or in the centre of a town.</p> <p>Norman Langford, an officer at the Association of University Chief Security Officers and head of security at Coventry University, is due to address the conference tomorrow. \"I'm going to talk about some of the issues regarding reducing the crime level against students and staff - about ensuring a more safe and secure learning environment and the issues that pertain to it,\" he said.</p> <p>The security team is \"holding its own\" at Coventry, he says. \"The problems are with mobile phones mostly. There is a lack of student awareness which increases the potential likelihood of their property being stolen.\" Luckily very little of the crime at Coventry is violent. Last year out of 17,000 students there were \"a couple\" of robberies and assaults but none on campus. </p> <p>A big problem for Coventry, where 30% of the students are from outside the UK, is making sure students understand the risks when they arrive in a totally new environment, he adds. \"Next week we will welcome thousands of students from all over the country who are gong to be away from home for the first time. They don't have the awareness of where they are compared with when they're at home.\"</p> <p>At Manchester University, PC Simon Collister, the Greater Manchester Police officer assigned to the university, will this week, along with one other colleague, address 10,000 students to inform them of the risks to their safety in Manchester. With the university based in the heart of the city, some students have come up against serious problems, he says. \"We did have a serious problem with street crime in Manchester,\" he explains. \"There was a street robbery problem for all young people and 80% of robberies are young men. We've reduced it significantly.\"</p> <p>In Manchester they have introduced Operation Hawk, which involved short spurts of intensive policing around high risk periods - most noticeably freshers week. If you go out on the town over the next three weeks, there will be around three times the police presence in the typical student areas but you won't necessarily notice. Most are undercover. </p> <p>Controversially Operation Hawk also gives officers the right to stop and search anyone they choose - without providing an explanation. \"It means we can stop and search at will, but it's not abused. It gives us the power to search them and look for knives or sharp objects which are likely to be used in robberies.\"</p> <p>Reams of advice will be dolled out by the NUS, security officers and police via posters and leaflets, both in Manchester and around the country over the next few weeks: don't use cash machines at night, or mobile phones on the street; take taxis and don't walk the streets alone. </p> <p>Whether that advice will include a reminder not to let your flatmates leave a key in the door is another matter.</p>",
  "<p>As he gears up for Labour's Brighton conference and the coming election campaign after another bruising year, David Blunkett is in fighting form, even by his own pugnacious standards. He likens himself to a frigate protecting Tony Blair's precious convoy of MPs seeking re-election.</p> <p>On the need to stand firm against terrorism in Iraq, he admits that \"it has divided the country, families and the Labour party. When I sit down to eat with friends, they disagree with me.\" </p> <p>But Mr Blair is an Iraq faintheart in comparison with his home secretary. The enemy \"are against everything we stand for and, were they to win, they would come for us - not with weapons of mass destruction, but with suicide bombers, with ricin and with the kind of weaponry al-Qaida use,\" Mr Blunkett will tell next week's party conference. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett says that things are getting better in Britain, but that many people cannot see it. He cites the revival of community spirit and activity in his working-class constituency of Sheffield Brightside; partly due to Labour's regeneration programmes, partly to growing self-confidence among people that they can make a difference. </p> <p>\"Iraq is the cloud that has resulted in people raising their umbrellas,\" he says. \"And when you have an umbrella over your head, it is sometimes difficult to feel the sun coming through. So we do need to address that domestic agenda, and I think you will find the prime minister will do just that next Tuesday in Brighton\". </p> <p>At the end of his interview on the red sofas in his office high above St James's Park, Mr Blunkett declares himself \"full of vitality, energy and drive.\" </p> <p>\"In the general election, I am going to be the frigate that takes the Tory fire - now they have gone back into their ideological bunker and concentrated on my area of work - so that the convoy forges on to victory. I am very happy to do that,\" he says. </p> <p>For a self-styled law-and-order populist who loves nothing better than to tease what he calls \"the liberal left\" intelligentsia (the people who never give a Labour government the benefit of the doubt, he says), Mr Blunkett describes himself as being tough in order to deliver \"good progressive things.\" </p> <p>\"I am the first home secretary in 100 years who has been able to sort out out sexual offences laws,\" Mr Blunkett says. </p> <p>Though he does not spell it out, he is referring to the divisive national trauma that followed Oscar Wilde's conviction and imprisonment in 1895, and which frightened politicians off reform for decades. It is a bold claim for an MP who initially voted against equalisation of the age of consent, but one made with characteristic conviction. </p> <p>And while he is on the subject, did he not this week release \"D\", the Algerian terrorist suspect held for two years? </p> <p>\"You don't want people incarcerated for ever, and you should review the evidence ... As for whether he should be removed [from Britain], I have taken the view that it would be wrong to return people to certain death. I wouldn't mind a bit of acknowledgement from the liberal left on that, either.\"</p> <p>The declared purpose of Mr Blunkett's interview is to emphasise that \"there has to be a third-term vision that does not simply say, 'This is what we have done. Give us a third term.' There has to be a vision of another kind of politics\" - one which Mr Blair, Mr Brown and he can all work towards. </p> <p>The key word in Mr Blunkett's analysis is security: what people need if they are to \"overcome alienation and disengagement. That's quite a challenge. People are disengaged because the world has changed so rapidly ... that change causes greater insecurity and fearfulness, which reinforces alienation from both the process of politics and from coping with change.\" </p> <p>He sees the need for a three-stranded narrative, to link the economic security that Mr Brown has been sustaining, neighbourhood security (a mixture of revived community empowerment and tough anti-crime measures), and the global security that Mr Blair is battling to develop. </p> <p>He argues forcefully that the terrorist threat has raised \"subliminal fears\" among voters that they are less secure; and that a combination of the global information network and the universality of English have made people fear a flood of migrants. </p> <p>By allowing citizens of new eastern European EU member states to openly \"register, work and pay taxes\" - instead of working clandestinely, as in most EU countries - Mr Blunkett claims to have disproved such predictions of a \"flood\". </p> <p>\"I had to hold my nerve in April because the media pressures were enormous. I am never going to satisfy the rightwing zealots,\" he says. But he also regrets that there are some people \"never reflecting whether they were right or wrong, who never go back and say, 'Was what we said at the time a load of garbage?'\" </p> <p>At moments like this, Mr Blunkett's angrier side emerges. It is clear that personal attacks hurt, and he protects his private life and private feelings very closely. They are not up for discussion in any form, though when an aide removes a curious wooden statue which will otherwise stick out of the home secretary's head in Dan Chung's photograph, he thanks him. \"I can do without any phallic symbols.\" </p> <p>But his optimism soon reasserts itself. When MPs actually discuss the details of anti-terrorist legislation, they always have a \"sensible thoughtful debate\" which goes unreported, he says. </p> <p>In one extraordinary comparison, he likens his inability to answer criticism over the terms of terror suspects' detention to the silence enforced on the Labour prime minister Clement Attlee after he and his inner cabinet secretly sanctioned the building of a British hydrogen bomb in the late 40s. </p> <p>\"I have to live with that, just as, when Churchill accused Attlee of not engaging with the H-bomb, Attlee was not able to say before the 1951 election, 'We are doing it.'\" </p> <p>It is not a comparison that will cheer all Labour veterans.</p>",
  "<p>They are genuinely asking, genuinely puzzled: at the Liberal Democrat fringe meetings and late-night parties in Bournemouth this week, Charlie Kennedy-supporting activists and MPs have been asking why fed-up Labour supporters don't do the obvious and simply switch to them. If you really find Tony Blair too right-wing, hated the Iraq war and want more progressive policies on tax and spending, they say, why not follow the logic of your own position? </p> <p>Not only do they have a strong point, many of them are people whom most Labourites would find instantly congenial. There's Shirley Williams, a heroine of mine since the 1970s, arguing with her brilliant combination of common sense and passion. In another corner there's the sharp, friendly and progressive Susan Kramer, likely to become the next MP for Richmond Park. At a packed fringe meeting, Menzies Campbell entertains for over an hour with reflections on his life - in sport and politics - proving himself as intelligent and decent a politician as you'll find in the Commons. And at a Guardian party, as a juice-sipping Charles Kennedy (\"all this Champagne Charlie nonsense - I've always loathed the stuff\") moves through the throng, the policy wonks and strategists around him seem very similar to their Labour rivals ... except, of course, that they're a bit to the left. </p> <p>It is becoming a party where many Labour activists could feel at home. Not only are Lib Dems personally decent, having sloughed off the weirdness and wackiness of the old days. But they have produced a pre-manifesto that ticks many of the right boxes - truly, at first sight, a progressives' wish list. </p> <p>Their emphasis on some of the most vulnerable groups is impressive: the promise of a pension rise for the over-75s; free personal care for the elderly and disabled; an end to university fees, tuition or top-up; a tax hike on people earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year, which strikes me as fair; and the introduction of local income tax (ditto). Overall, though they still don't say how they would pay for their promises to the elderly beyond the immediate term, the effect would be strongly redistributive, as much between age as class groups. </p> <p>Even more important, they seem to be taking the environment seriously, as Labour traditionally never has. Higher taxes on gas-guzzling cars, including those gross \"Chelsea tractors\" - the belching 4x4s that hog London streets - are particularly welcome, but their moves on air travel are potentially more radical. It won't be popular to stop the cheap flights bonanza, but it is environmental suicide not to try. If only Labour would take note. </p> <p>Then, inevitably, comes Iraq. Kennedy did not lead the kind of anti-war crusade around the country that earlier Liberals might have done - no whiff of Gladstone's Midlothian campaign rhetoric or Lloyd George in full withering flow. He was excessively cautious and pulled his punches at key moments in the Commons in ways that made some of us shout at the telly. Still, he stood out bravely against the Bush-led regime change folly and he was an early, shrewd critic of the lack of post-war planning. Having endured mockery and antagonism in equal measure in the Commons chamber, Kennedy has been proved right, and has earned the right to keep challenging Blair on trust. </p> <p>So far, so good. And yet, watching the debates in the sparsely attended conference hall in Bournemouth, I can't help thinking that it's more than simple tribalism that stops me supporting the Lib Dems. For a start, the well-worn formula that they are neither right nor left, just forward, doesn't wash. Earlier in the week, they claimed to be jubilant when the Mirror described them as \"Orange Tories\", while the Sun claimed they were jolting to the left. Far from having outsmarted their opponents as the Lib Dems claim, it looks to me as if they are simply confused. </p> <p>The anger sparked by the Orange Book - a collection of policy proposals including a scheme for national health insurance - demonstrates rabid disagreement about whether the Lib Dems should be a party of hard-edged economic liberals or more traditional social democratic types. Why should Labour people, however cross we feel, now help to destroy the Labour party - which, with all its faults, is on the centre left - in favour of a one-off bundle of policy ideas and a group of politicians who don't quite hang together ideologically? Do we really trust Vincent Cable and David Laws as the shapers of Britain's progressive future? </p> <p>Second, though the Lib Dems make all the right noises about fairness and equality, their real commitment remains dubious. Equal pay, work-life balance and affordable childcare are shooting to the top of Labour's agenda, driven by the substantial number of strong Labour women MPs. The Lib Dems have little to say about all this, and refuse to adopt any effective measures to boost their pitiful number of women MPs - just 11% of the total. Of their top 30 target seats, less than 25% have selected women candidates. Yet Matthew Taylor, their chair, suggests the sole reason for this is that there aren't enough women out there who would like to do the job. </p> <p>But above all, the Lib Dems need a severe, jolting reality check. Barring a cataclysmic political upset, a vote for them remains a protest vote. They remain far below Labour in the polls, despite the war, tuition fees and all the rest. Labour retains strong ties to hundreds of thousands of progressive working-class and middle-class people through the union link. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are political operators at a different level of thinking and experience than anyone in the Lib Dem fold. </p> <p>New Labour has delivered economic stability, the minimum wage, a major redistribution in favour of poorer working families, constitutional reforms and real improvements in health and education. For a party that has never held power at Westminster and indulges in all sorts of unlikely cohabitations to hold local power, to simply dismiss this as failure isn't just impertinent. It's actually funny. </p> <p>And, while those of us fed up with some aspects of Blair's leadership do applaud individual Lib Dem policies, and would even like to see them taken up by ministers, we also know that the Labour party is not simply Tony's party. It is a broad coalition. It is full of talented, progressive politicians who also want a leftish turn, and whose time will come - much more certainly than the time of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>So it is reality, not accusations of hypocrisy, that keeps me outside the Lib Dem camp. Far better a share of real power today than a dream. </p> <p>Like many, I have a residual doubt about where the Lib Dems might end up; I know their opportunism in the past and that they are bidding keenly for Tory votes. So when they say they want centre-left support but sneer at the very phrase \"centre-left\", it is hardly surprising they engender suspicion. My Lib Dem friends, you have some good policies and some good people. But you cannot simultaneously look down your noses and hold out your hands. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>ITV pushed on with its disposal programme yesterday by selling its stake in French technology group Thomson in a deal that will reduce its debt by \u00a3172m. </p> <p>The 5.5% shareholding was inherited by ITV following the merger of Granada and Carlton earlier this year. The broadcaster sold its 15.5m shares to investment banks Citigroup and UBS and the proceeds will be used to cut net debt from \u00a3571m to \u00a3399m. </p> <p>The stake sale follows the disposal of ITV's Carlton Books operation in a management buyout last month as the clearout of non-core businesses began. The group has received initial bids for its spe cial-effects subsidiary, the Moving Picture Company, with the transaction expected to raise between \u00a350m and \u00a360m. It is understood that Michael Green, the former Carlton chairman, and advertising group WPP are not in the running for MPC despite initial interest. </p> <p>Charles Allen, the chief executive of ITV, said the disposal process was \"well-advanced\" following the Thomson deal. </p> <p>\"We're delighted to have disposed of our largest non-core asset sooner than expected, at a five-month high, and reduced our borrowings by \u00a3172m. This disposal, together with the recent sale of Carlton Books and the initial bids we've received for the Moving Picture Company, means that we are well advanced in disposing of our non-core assets, restructuring our balance sheet and significantly reducing our debt.\" </p> <p>ITV is conducting a review of its non-core holdings but it is expected to seek buyers for stakes in Arsenal and Liverpool football clubs and a shareholding in Australian broadcaster Seven Network. </p> <p>The wholly owned Granada Learning and Carlton Screen Advertising are also poised for disposal but it is understood that a stake in cinema chain Village Roadshow will be retained. </p> <p>Earlier this month Mr Allen said stakes in SMG - owner of two ITV franchises in Scotland - GMTV, ITN and Ireland's TV3 would not be sold. Analysts expect ITV to take full control of GMTV and SMG over time as it picks up the remaining independent licences within the ITV network. </p> <p>Bidders for MPC have been invited to conduct due diligence, and ITV hopes to close a deal by the end of next month. MPC is expected to post earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of \u00a39m next year, up from \u00a36m this year - although analysts cautioned it could require considerable investment from the buyer. </p> <p>\"It's a business that is capital-intensive. If it has been under-invested in for a number of years it could require a lot of investment,\" said Anthony de Larrinaga, a sector analyst at SGs Securities.</p>",
  "<p><strong> 'Didn't millions cheer?'</strong><br> </p> <p>It was not until Tuesday that the media began to hear what Momart had been storing in the warehouse (it has not been known until now that the \"Momart warehouse\" was, in fact, a warehouse Momart rented from a household removals firm). From the first reporting of the fire, on TV and radio and in evening newspapers on Tuesday, the media focused almost exclusively on the loss of works in the collection of the former advertising mogul Charles Saatchi, and on three artists in particular: Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers, Dinos and Jake. This was partly because Saatchi released the news of the damage to his collection early - the presence of paintings by Ayres, Heron and Heath, as well as works by more obscure artists such as Redgrave, only emerged later - and partly because Emin, Hirst and the Chapmans were lead characters in Britain's great popular narrative of celebrity, money, talent and scandal. </p> <p>Over the next two days, the news spread around the globe. Big papers in the world's traditional art capitals ran lengthy stories. Le Monde devoted 500 words to the catastrophe, writing of the destruction of \" la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre tente de Tracy Amin\" (sic). The New York Times ran a thousand-word story on the blow to \"the influential and showy Young British Artist movement championed and sustained by Mr Saatchi for the last 15 or so years.\" Under the headline Flaming Tragedy, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung devoted 700 words to the conflagration, including \" das Zelt von Tracey Emin\". As the news edged away from the great conurbations it slipped down the list. The News-Tribune in Duluth, Minnesota, relegated the information to a 111-word news in brief, after short paragraphs about the death of 860 people in Caribbean floods and plans to build a new Wal-Mart store in Chicago. </p> <p>By this time, reaction to the fire in Britain had already taken a decisive shift in another direction: towards glee and schadenfreude. A virtual mob of journalists, pundits, radio phone-in callers, letter-writers and vox poppers declared in one way or another that the Momart loss was Britain's gain. Whoever set the building alight, they implied, was an artist at least on a par with any of the creators in the Saatchi collection. </p> <p>\"The large picture on this page aptly illustrates the smouldering ruins of British modern art. It is a ghastly sight,\" wrote Tom Morgan in the Daily Express. \"Indeed, it is so horrible that some experts believe the photograph could be framed and entered for the Turner prize. They would further argue that the scorched and smoking scene has more intrinsic value than the \u00a350m worth of pieces destroyed in the blaze.\" In the Daily Mirror, the columnist and novelist Tony Parsons asked: \"Can a fire ever be funny? Only if all the overpriced, over-discussed trash that we have had rammed down our throats in recent years by these ageing enfant terribles is consumed by the fire. Then the fire is not merely funny ... it is bloody hilarious.\" </p> <p>The newdesks of two of Britain's biggest newspapers both had the same idea on Wednesday, 48 hours after the fire began. Next day the Sun ran a story bylined \"Toulouse Le Plot, Sun fine art critic.\" Le Plot said he had saved a fortune by replacing one of Emin's pieces with a tent he had bought for \u00a325. \"Tracey sewed the names on her tent, but I cut the letters out from cardboard and stuck them on with a 50p second-hand Pritt stick,\" wrote Le Plot. In the Daily Mail, Paul Harris recorded: \"In the space of an afternoon, using techniques gleaned from the Blue Peter school of art, we knocked up a replica of the love tent and the names it contained. The result was a work, you may think, which is indistinguishable from the real thing.\" Elsewhere in the same edition of the paper Godfrey Barker asked: \"Didn't millions cheer as this 'rubbish' went up in flames?\" </p> <p>The hostility and scepticism went beyond the old tabloids to the new ones, always focusing on Emin, Hirst and the Chapmans and on how easy modern art was to make and thus remake. \"Why can't Brit Art's finest devote half a weekend to knocking them out all over again?\" asked Hugh Rifkind in the Times. Tom Lubbock in the Independent wrote: \"It's odd to hear talk about irreplaceable losses. Really? You'd have thought that, with the will and the funding, many of these works were perfectly replaceable. It wouldn't be very hard for Tracey Emin to re-stitch the names of Every One I Have Ever Slept With on to a little tent (it might need some updating since 1995.)\" </p> <p>On the first edition of Radio 4's Any Questions? after the fire, a questioner asked David Lammy, Theresa May, William Rees-Mogg and Don Foster: \"Does the panel mourn the loss of works of modern art, such as Tracey Emin's tent?\" </p> <p>May said: \"I'm just waiting for Tate Modern now to have a pile of ashes in the room, as one of the exhibitions.\" The audience applauded. Jonathan Dimbleby asked May if she had heard of Patrick Heron. May said she had not. Dimbleby told her that Heron's widow Katharine had described the fire as like a bereavement. May tried to backtrack. Dimbleby turned to Rees-Mogg, who had been honing his response to the original question. \"I think mourn is a bit strong,\" he said, and the audience laughed and clapped. </p> <p>One of the people listening, at his home in Barnes, was Mel Gooding, Heron's biographer. He told me recently that he didn't hold it against Dimbleby that the presenter wrongly described Katharine Heron as Patrick Heron's widow - the artist's wife, Delia, is dead, and Katharine is one of their two daughters - but had been shocked by Rees-Mogg's dismissal of the impact of the loss of artworks. </p> <p>Gooding called up an email from the Heron family he had received on the morning of May 26, telling him that a large group of Patrick's paintings would never be seen again. </p> <p>\"That idea - it makes me feel strange, even reading it now,\" he said. \"If you are concerned with art, and love art, and are very closely involved with a particular artist's work, and know you'll never see it again - that's why it's a bereavement. It's like when someone dies. You know you'll never be able to speak to them again. To hear the dreadful Rees-Mogg say 'mourn is a bit strong' struck me as appallingly insensitive.\" </p> <p>Even now, four months later, Katharine Heron said, \"I find it almost impossible to talk about it because it's so raw.\" The strained tone of her voice as she spoke expressed the truth of it. \"The insurers are dealing with everything and we're leaving it in their hands. From their point of view it couldn't be simpler: it's a material loss. From our point of view, the loss is completely different.\" </p> <p>About 50 of Heron's paintings were lost in the fire (the family is not yet releasing the exact details). The artist's reputation has risen lately, on the back of a successful retrospective at the Tate in 1998. Many of the paintings stored in the warehouse Momart rented from Goldstar Removals were from that exhibition, including his acclaimed final works. \"We hadn't decided where they would go afterwards,\" said Katharine. \"We thought we had plenty of time. </p> <p>\"Even at the worst stage of people burning books, actually, somewhere, the manuscript or the idea or the story stayed, and even if you lost the score of a piece of music, or if you lost a choreography, they can be recreated, because they exist by being reproduced. The thing about something like a painting or a sculpture or any other artefact-based art form is, once it's gone, it has gone. It's so absolutely final. </p> <p>\"The first thing is, I think: Thank God nobody died. People always come first. But the second thought is that, actually, the whole life of somebody like my father was about his art, every single thing was focused on his art, and if a substantial amount of his work is destroyed, it's like denying his existence, a denial of life.\" </p> <p>Blameless as she is, Katharine Heron is troubled by another feeling: guilt. \"I just sort of think one of my responsibilities in life is to be the curator, or the looker-after of these things, the guardian of them, so there's a very strong feeling that one's somehow failed to look after something that wasn't for oneself, but for other people. No matter what anybody says, I keep coming back to that feeling. I've had huge pleasure from these paintings but my children, my grandchildren, won't have that pleasure.\" Others may miss Vertical Light most strongly: Katharine Heron will miss her father's painting of her mother when her mother was pregnant with her. </p> <p>Katharine Heron is an artist too. She is a successful architect and heads the architecture department at Westminster University. I asked her about the reaction of the media and the public to the fire. \"Artists still have the ability to make people frightened,\" she said. \"So they make them into a joke ... I think art, altogether, has taken a beating from this fire.\" </p> <p>I interviewed Michael Craig-Martin in his beautifully austere, white, bright studio, located at ground zero of British hipness somewhere between Clerkenwell and Shoreditch. Some of his recent prints, colours as sharp as sweets, lay on view; he had two shows coming up. Craig-Martin said he had been disturbed by the vehemence towards the destroyed art from the more serious press. He had felt strongly enough about Lubbock's piece in the Independent to write to that paper in protest. </p> <p>\"I thought, in the review I wrote a letter about, that there was extraordinary personal anger, this is revenge, he's furious about something,\" Craig-Martin told me. \"Many of the people in the art world are very angry about the art world. I don't know much about the other worlds but I never get the impression that the worlds of music or the worlds of theatre or literature have so many people who are angry at the art form itself, and angry or disappointed or upset about it. There's a lot of people involved in the art world who are on the verge of hating it.\" </p> <p>Talking about Britain and its relationship to art, Craig-Martin recalled the treatment of Jacob Epstein's Ages of Man sculptures for the British Medical Association building - now Zimbabwe House - on the Strand, in 1907. Edwardian London proved unprepared for 18 monumental, anatomically correct, naked males in a public place, and the Evening Standard launched a campaign to have them removed. In the 1930s, on the pretext that a fractured stone penis had fallen and nearly killed a pedestrian, the sculptures were castrated and mutilated; thus they remain today, neither fully destroyed nor fully preserved. It was as if the icon-smashing years of the Reformation had never been forgotten. </p> <p>\"In most other countries the average person is not interested,\" he said. \"Here there's a history of vehement attacks on, particularly, the visual arts, and I always wonder whether this doesn't have some puritan base, some base in iconoclasm, the destruction of the arts in the past; if there isn't some strange folk memory of this thing. It's hard to understand the level of upset about it unless there was some deep-seated feeling that it was really very, very important.\" </p> <p>An attack on some of the artists whose work was stored in the Goldstar Removals warehouse could have been an attack on all, but it wasn't, really. Among the artists whose work was lost in the fire, there was a stark dividing line between the relatively young celebrity artists such as Emin, the Chapmans and Hirst, those who rose to prominence in the 1990s under Saatchi's patronage, and the abstract expressionist artists whose rise came in the 1960s, such as Heron, Ayres and Heath. </p> <p>In an extremely concise email, Emin told me that she was still angry at the way she had been singled out for special treatment after the fire, to the extent that she had wondered about leaving Britain. \"The papers are always going to pick on me,\" she wrote. \"It does make me think sometimes why do I still live in this country?\" Yet she at least has the consolation of notoriety, not to mention great patronage. The older generation of artists caught up in the Momart disaster did not just lose work: they were mentioned, in the coverage, as an afterthought, lacking the popular infamy of the once-Young British Artists but not yet having acquired the popular affection once despised modern artists, like the French impressionists, have won. </p> <p>Both Emin and Dinos Chapman told me that they had not been influenced by the work or philosophy of the older British artists whose work was destroyed. Few artists in any field will admit to being heirs to the previous generation, even if they are, but I felt that Emin and Chapman meant it. Chapman went further, sounding Rees-Moggian in his brisk endorsement of the disposability of art. \"I think it's quite strange to have a sense of mourning over an object. As Tracey said, nobody died. </p> <p>\"I don't believe in the longevity of art. There's lots of stuff gone missing or past its sell-by date. This is why we're not so cut up about Hell. In a funny way it's quite nice that not very many people saw it. It's achieved a transcendent status now. While it was alive and kicking everybody thought it was a rather tasteless parody and now it's been burned and gone up to heaven it's seen as a transcendent work of art.\" </p> <p>Craig-Martin put a counterword in for posterity. \"There are people who have lost great swathes of work who are not the most famous people. But who's to know whether they may come to be seen as of greater importance in 50 to 100 years. This is possibly the worst moment for artists: when you're superseded by the next generation, that's when you look at your worst, that's the hardest moment, really, the moment before rediscovery.\" </p> <p><strong>Paintings were not insured </strong></p> <p>If you want to know why anyone in the south of England needs a four-wheel drive car, try visiting Gillian Ayres in her house on the Devon-Cornwall border, after the monsoon rains of a global-warming August, without a decent map, in a rented Peugeot the size of a shoebox. Ayres, who is 74 years old, plied me with ham sandwiches and wine when I arrived, an hour late. The house, part of which is about 600 years old, smelled hospitably of old upholstery, furniture polish and roast meat. Recently, but before the fire, Ayres suffered a heart attack, and moves around with the aid of a stick. She still drives and paints her enormous canvases in the studio in the house but doesn't get to her native London as often as she used to. </p> <p>Ayres lost 18 paintings in the fire: five of her own, two belonging to her sons, and 11 belonging to her friend Shirley Conran. Due to a recent oversight on her part the ones belonging to Ayres were not insured and she, together with Conran, has hired a lawyer, Razi Mireskandari, with a view to suing Momart for negligence - an accusation Momart denies. It is a sad conclusion to a long relationship: Ayres got to know the founder of Momart, Jim Moyes, in the 1970s, when he was just starting out. They have been friends ever since, though Moyes left the company some years ago - partly, he told me recently, because of the change of atmosphere there after the investment company 3i bought into it. In those early days, when Ayres lived in Wales, Moyes sometimes used to stay the weekend when he came to pick up paintings. </p> <p>The only Momart warehouse Ayres ever saw, she said, was the firm's showcase operation at its headquarters in Richmond Road, Hackney, which, she recalls, had automatic fireproof doors. She says she did not know her work was actually being stored in a rented warehouse in Leyton. \"We got bills and it was always 'Momart, Richmond Road'. And I thought that's where the paintings were because one has used that place for 20 years, since the 80s ... I had no idea they'd farmed them out to various other places.\" </p> <p>\"It was a perfectly nice afternoon here, and in fact my son was here,\" said Ayres, remembering the day she heard about what had happened. \"He thought I was asleep and I wasn't, I was reading in the kitchen, and they phoned, Momart phoned, and said: 'All your work's gone. There was a fire, and we think it's all gone.' And ... well, nothing really happened much then.\" What was her immediate reaction? </p> <p>\"Well ... 'Fucking hell!' </p> <p>You don't expect them to turn to ashes in a few hours. It isn't something you think of. It's a very lonely business being an artist. You shut yourself up and do all this bloody work and - it's gone! And so I felt a bit - my son cried, but no, I didn't burst into tears.\" She did, she admitted, feel \"a bit glum\". She went off to do some printmaking as solace. Ayres leafed through a book of her paintings, pointing out the ones that had burned. \"Altair. It's a great big 10 by 10 and it's gone. Funnily enough that one's gone. That one's in the British Council ... that's gone ... that's gone ... well, what saved them is when people have got them, I suppose ... that's gone. Lord Gowrie used to have that one but I'm not sure if he still has, and I'm not sure if I know where it is, but anyway, it's alive, I think. That one's gone. </p> <p>\"I think you probably hope that you do give people something. There's a painting of mine in Birmingham city gallery and they said they actually had to put a barrier up because children ran towards it. I think certainly you are aiming at something like this. I think you probably hope they're there for a thousand years. I mean I don't know - there's deep colour rot, all sorts of things but ... bang, it's a cinder in five minutes.\" </p> <p>Ayres didn't see the media mockery of the burned artworks. But she was hurt by reports of a function at the Tate shortly after the fire which gave her the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota was only concerned about the loss to Britart. (Subsequently, Serota has made clear that he understands the fire was \"a far greater disaster for British art than most people know\" and that it affected \"scores of artists and collectors, way beyond Charles [Saatchi]\".) </p> <p>Craig-Martin said he thought there was an unusual, peculiarly British divide between the abstract expressionists who flourished in the 1960s and 1970s and the artists who came to prominence in the 1990s. What stood between them was the 1980s, the decade of Thatcher, and of Saatchi, the man who sold her and went on to revolutionise the collecting of British art. </p> <p>\"The 70s were a very difficult period to live in Britain, it was not easy, there was very little money and there were great stresses socially, and then Mrs Thatcher came along and turned the entire thing upside down in a way that's completely extraordinary, and then by the 90s you have a culture that has changed its values. Very few countries do this in quite such a dramatic manner. When I go back to America, where I grew up, it may be more extreme in certain ways than it was in the 60s or 50s but it's not culturally different. Whereas the country I came to in 1960 has disappeared. </p> <p>\"There was an absolutely clear art world in New York in 1966. Virtually every artist was represented by a gallery in some way. You have a fabric of an art world, which is there is a kind of critical discourse going on among artists in relation to critics, there are galleries exhibiting the newest work, there are collectors purchasing some of this work. When I came to Britain, I found an extraordinary vitality of artists, a tiny number of contemporary galleries, and an even smaller number of collectors. Most of those galleries survived by selling works by British artists to foreigners. Now, there's an exaggerated sense of money and celebrity: one went from a situation here where private galleries and collectors almost didn't exist to the other extreme.\" </p> <p>Emerging from either side of that great ridge of the Thatcher years, united by fire apparently only in the most arbitrary way, the heterogenous Chapmans and Ayres nonetheless overlap in the simplest and most important sense: they make their art, firstly, for themselves. \"We don't make work for people to buy,\" said Dinos Chapman. \"We make it so that we can look at it.\" Ayres said something similar: \"I personally don't work for you, or anybody.\" And she laughed. </p> <p><strong>Hell will be reborn</strong> </p> <p>Craigie Horsfield and his Polish wife Ewa had guests coming round one morning towards the end of May and, to air their terraced house in Hackney, they opened the windows. A pungent smell of burning rubber filled the rooms and Carrer Muntaner was made was not the Craigie Horsfield of now. \"The conditions of your actually making it are very specific to that particular time of your thinking about it, the decisions about whether it looked right, whether you choose this particular negative, what it's intended to do within the project,\" he said. </p> <p>Horsfield pointed out of the window, to where the afternoon sun was slanting through leaves. \"The light changes from moment to moment,\" he said. \"Although in the afternoon you think the only thing that's changing is the sun going down, it's actually not. There are all kinds of things. The angle of light changes not only the shadows but the areas between shadows. Everything we see is changing all of the time, even at night, whether there's a moon or not.\" </p> <p>Carrer Muntaner had no glass or gloss. It had a matt surface \"like skin\", said Horsfield, which was intended to transform the photograph from souvenir of past time to something more like an eternal present. As he talked, describing the intricate layers of Catalan history represented by the architecture in the picture, and as we looked at the mean little reproduction in a book, I began to feel a deep sense of regret that I would never get to see the original of a photograph which until a few days earlier I had never heard of. </p> <p>\"People die in a lifetime who are a dreadful loss, and who you regret decades later, even realising, in the inevitability of time, death comes along, and I think of my father, who died 20 years ago, and yet I still regret his loss, sometimes desperately,\" said Horsfield. He stared at the reproduction. \"This is what I spent 35 years of my life trying to escape from, precisely because it's so much not what it was. It was rougher, it was physically there. Whereas here, it's just a photograph of a city.\" </p> <p>Some of the burned artists are, nonetheless, thinking about remaking their works. When I first called Dinos Chapman he asked me to call him back because he was \"glueing skeletons together\". Later he said he and his brother were already preparing themselves to redo Hell, only to backtrack into ambiguity. \"There's nothing wrong with a bit of forest clearance because it allows new things to come out, rather than fetishise something that's more or less served its purpose. And there's always the possibility of actually revisiting and remaking something along the lines of Hell,\" he said. </p> <p>I spoke to Dinos again this week: he revealed that, indeed, Hell was to be reborn, albeit in another guise. \"It would be a stupid waste of time to remake that [original] but we are going to make a sculpture that will be a bigger, better version. It will be small figures on a large diorama.\" </p> <p>In an interview with Irvine Welsh in the New York style magazine Black Book, Damien Hirst said he was undecided. \"With technology today things can be remade, so there's a dilemma as to what is the most important thing - what the artist was trying to communicate at the time, or the actual object itself? I've lost about 17 paintings now, the spin paintings, and I can make another spin painting, but it would never be the same as the ones I've lost.\" </p> <p>Paul Le Boutillier, a fine art insurance broker with Heath Lambert - Momart's insurers - said he had known of cases where artists agreed to remake work for owners. \"They charge us for their time,\" he said. \"Other artists have point-blank refused, saying they could never recapture the essence or the moment. Some artists refused to allow fire-damaged artwork to be sold under their name. </p> <p>\"I remember when I was younger, photography claims were quite troublesome. I think a lot of people would react the same way: 'Why don't you just print another one?' It's a controversy that's been raging very quietly in my world for quite a long time. But I'm an insurance broker. If a client presents something to me which I can present to an underwriter, I will arrange them a policy.\" </p> <p>Leboutillier had little sympathy for the uninsured. \"We understand that people do get very emotional about their artwork and that we are insuring something unique, but when it comes to the question of somebody who simply hasn't purchased insurance, it does open your eyes to the fact that insurance is a business.\" Without insurance, the rules are that Momart pays out according to the same treaty which governs compensation for air travellers whose baggage is destroyed, the Warsaw Convention. The weight of Redgrave's sculpture and Ayres' paintings will be estimated, and compensation paid out at the rate of 60 cents a pound. </p> <p><strong>'Momart is blameless' </strong></p> <p>In June, police arrested a man on suspicion of burglary at the unit where the fire broke out. He has still not been charged, and is due to be seen by the police again next month. I asked Momart about the concerns of Conran, Ayres and Redgrave, about why the company used space inside a building occupied by other businesses, and what fire monitoring systems, if any, had been in place. No one from Momart was prepared to be interviewed. In an email, the firm's managing director, Eugene Boyle, said: \"We are pleased that the majority [of our clients] seem to feel that Momart is blameless, and continue to give us their full support. We do also recognise that some clients will naturally feel angry at the loss of their property, and will cast around for someone to blame. However, we feel it is clear that we are all victims of a criminal act perpetrated on one of our neighbours located some distance away.\" Boyle declined to say whether Momart had fitted the Goldstar Removals warehouse with modern fire protection systems. </p> <p>No one knows how much insurers will pay out in total as a result of the Momart fire. A figure of \u00a350 million has been suggested, but it is the roughest of guesses. Unlike the artists who have lost work, the financial world will absorb the losses without a quiver. \"The loss disappears far beyond the art world,\" said Le Boutillier. </p> <p>\"It just disappears somewhere into the vast sea of zeroes floating between computers in the insurance market.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/britartfire/story/0,14634,1310814,00.html\">Read the first part of James Meek's investigation</a></p>",
  "<p>Pigs may never fly, but in the north of England fish are about to start climbing ladders, on a 500-mile network of rivers blocked by weirs since the industrial revolution. </p> <p>Dozens of sites are being considered for fish \"passes\" to allow salmon and newly-stocked populations of barbell, chubb and other coarse fish to return to traditional spawning grounds sealed off for centuries by the mills' demand for power. </p> <p>The move by the Environment Agency is the second stage in a campaign to heal the effects of the age of heavy industry, following a largely successful clean-up of river water. This has had the startling effect in the past five years of reintroducing salmon to many rivers in Yorkshire. </p> <p>\"We want to encourage the opening-up of rivers across the region,\" said Pat O'Brien, head of the agency's fisheries team in Leeds, which is focussing on stretches of the Calder and Aire in some of the 19th century's most heavily-exploited areas. Fish which need to travel up to 25 miles to spawn must traverse weirs as frequently as every half-mile on some stretches, with no way through the curving stone dams. </p> <p>The agency's answer, in co-operation with weir-owners, developers and local authorities, is the \"pass\" or stone ladder, which allows fish to skirt the weirs - and provides a tourist attraction as a by-product. Visitors have been drawn to several successful schemes, including a \u00a376,000 restoration of the 18th century fish pass at Boroughbridge weir on the Ure, where the rare lamprey migrates. </p> <p>Lampreys form part of Yorkshire lore, with thousands of the fish - now protected by law - taken from the Ouse for events such as the Great Feast of Cawood. When rivers were dammed before the 18th century - usually to run corn mills or provide consistently navigable stretches - fish passes were often a condition imposed by the lord of the manor. </p> <p>Their revival by the agency, working with angling and environmental groups and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, is a long-term project because of cost: each weir pass costs an average of \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Mr O'Brien said: \"We have identified 30 major obstructions which need a pass on the Aire alone. Multiply \u00a3250,000 by 30 and tell me how many people in Yorkshire are going to come up straight away with that kind of money.\" </p> <p>But pressure for progress is also considerable, following three years of expensive fish-stocking by the agency. Winter flooding and the regular washing of fish downriver over weirs threatens to deplete the new populations. \"Once a stable population is established, stocking shouldn't be required,\" said Mr O'Brien. \"It makes sense to provide facilities for fish to return to their natural habitats rather than to rely on stocking.\" </p> <p>The agency has warned campaigners for greater free fish passage that its own pot of \"weir money\" is limited, with most of the fees from coarse fishing licences - which cost \u00a323 a year and form 80% of income from anglers - ring-fenced for other improvements. </p> <p>\"We can do a lot as a facilitator,\" said Mr O'Brien, who negotiated space for a future pass at Shipley, where Bradford Rowing Club has just spent \u00a375,000 on repairs to Hirst weir. The club chairman, Hugh Scott, said: \"We didn't have the funds to put a pass in straight away, but we worked with the agency to make sure that there's part of the weir where one can be added when money becomes available.\" </p> <p>The Calder will benefit from a windfall brought by Channel 4's series on the regeneration of Castleford, which has helped attract leading architects to the West Yorkshire town. One of the showpiece projects designed by London firm McDowell and Benedetti is a salmon ladder round the local weir. </p> <p>The agency is also dusting off legal powers which can be used to force improvements to weirs on recognised salmon rivers, although Mr O'Brien and his colleagues are reluctant to see them used. </p> <p>\"It may often be the case that a weir belongs to an old mill or someone who, with the best will in the world, can no longer maintain it. In those circumstances, you need to be practical.\"</p>",
  "<b> New York Times</b> Editorial, September 22 <br>\"We did not expect President George Bush to come before the United Nations [on Tuesday] in the middle of his re-election campaign and acknowledge the serious mistakes his administration has made on Iraq. But that still left plenty of room for him to take advantage of this one last chance to appeal to an increasingly antagonistic world to help the Iraqis secure and rebuild their shattered nation and prepare for elections in just four months. Instead, Mr Bush delivered an inexplicably defiant campaign speech in which he glossed over the current dire situation in Iraq for an audience acutely aware of the true state of affairs, and scolded them for refusing to endorse the American invasion ... <p>\"Mr Bush might have done better at wooing broader international support if he had spent less time on self-justification and scolding and more on praising the importance of international cooperation and a strengthened UN. Instead, his tone-deaf speechwriters achieved a perverse kind of alchemy, transforming a golden opportunity into a lead balloon.\" </p> <p><b> Philadelphia Inquirer</b> Editorial, September 22 <br>\"All the lovely speeches describing gauzy dreams of what Mr Bush would like Iraq to be do not change the grisly goings-on on the ground. It is as though Mr Bush thinks the world will conform to his vision if only he pounds the lectern harder; if only he squints more, the world will see things his way ... </p> <p>\"It is too late for Mr Bush to pretend he's a global guy. Multilateralism, which remains the best policy framework for keeping the US safe, entails more than daring the world to join him at his demand.

America needs more international support than it is getting, in Iraq and elsewhere.\" </p> <p><b> Los Angeles Times</b> Editorial, September 22 <br>\"Mr Bush's continued refusal to accept that international cooperation means more than doing what Washington orders has made others reluctant to step in. </p> <p>\"Without a change in strategy and tactics by the administration, Iraq will be an unavoidable Topic A at the president's annual UN speech again next year, with little likelihood of a more stable and secure nation, or world.

  "I hate to disillusion Mark Seddon (Letters, September 18) but it is unclear that, even with a second resolution, the invasion of Iraq would have been legal. The fact that so many on the left are keen to embrace the UN system and international law is strange, given that the central value of both is not human rights but state sovereignty. <p>I have no doubt that Tony Blair dissembled over his reasons for taking us to war. To have openly declared his intention to take part in regime change on the basis of the nature of Saddam's rule would have opened him to prosecution under the international criminal court. To aid the victims of tyranny is illegal; to defend yourself from the threat of WMD is not. </p> <p>Too many on the left treat the UN and the system of international law as if it was what they wished, rather than as what it is. The focus on state sovereignty means that it protects tyrants, not their victims. There may be those who want to insist that there was some other way to rid Iraq of Saddam. But sanctions only hurt the Iraqi people, not the regime. And both non-violent and violent internal opposition was brutally suppressed. Even Saddam's death was only likely to bring one of his psychotic sons to power. So the war in Iraq may well have been illegal, but that does not make it immoral. Unjust laws are there for the breaking. The principle of state sovereignty is the most unjust law of all. <br> <b> Adam E Rule</b><br> Newcastle </p> <p>Just as Tony Blair admits that Iraq has become a \"crucible\" for the battle against global terrorism, a senior diplomat, Sir Ivor Roberts, gets flack for stating that Bush has been a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida (Al-Qaida would back Bush, says UK envoy, September 21). If Blair thinks Iraq has become this crucible, then surely we should be asking why. </p> <p>It seems that the prime minister has ignored Foreign Office concerns for some time over the intelligence on weapons, the legality of the war and the dangers of the postwar environment in favour of listening to Bush. His linkage of Iraq and terrorism is a linkage that many foresaw before the war. A little more humility from Blair in front of this barrage of expert advice and perhaps Britain might have steered a slightly safer course through choppy waters. <br> <b>Chris Doyle</b><br> Director, Council for Arab-British Understanding </p> <p>Dan Plesch repeats the call for impeachment (Comment, September 22), but in the democratic era the idea that the House of Lords should be able to remove a prime minister is complete nonsense. </p> <p>In the pre-democratic era impeachment was a way of \"liquidating\" opponents. Now the ballot box is available for political opponents, and the criminal courts for criminals, which is why a commons select committee recommended abolishing impeachment in 1967. If the opposition wishes to try to remove the prime minister at any time they can move a vote of no confidence, or wait for the general election. </p> <p>In reality, the impeachment call is just a publicity stunt. Tony Benn says on the same page: \"The House of Commons voted for the war and MPs are unlikely to go into the lobby to condemn themselves\" (MPs can end this Iraq folly, September 22). He could have added that many of us who voted against the war reject any charge that the prime minister acted in bad faith. </p> <p>In a free society everyone is entitled to oppose their rulers, but using lawyers and lords to try to topple an elected government is fundamentally undemocratic. <br> <b> Kevin Brennan MP</b><br> Lab, Cardiff West</p>",
  "The price paid by Britain for Tony Blair's decision to join the invasion of Iraq has until now been relatively low. British casualties have been proportionately fewer than those of the Americans. By occupying the Shia-dominated south, British troops were at least initially spared the scale of guerrilla attacks that greeted US forces from the first days. Few Britons had until this week been caught up in the kidnappings sweeping Iraq and, despite dire government warnings, Britain has so far been spared the kind of revenge attack suffered, for example, by Spain - which Blair was told to expect in intelligence briefings in the run-up to war. <p>Now all that is changing. Since the start of Moqtada al-Sadr's insurrection last April, resistance has mushroomed across the south. In recent weeks British forces have been under regular assault, caught up in bloody firefights and forced back to barracks by the increase in attacks in Basra, Amara and elsewhere. Evidence has been piling up of the killing and maltreatment of Iraqis in and out of custody by British troops, whose local reputation for brutality is a far cry from the benign paternalism often hailed in the British media. And now a British engineer working at a US military base faces the horrific fate meted out to his two fellow American kidnap victims, who were apparently decapitated in person by the Jordanian jihadist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said to be linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>Zarqawi and his tactics are opposed by much of the mainstream Iraqi national resistance, which now shows every sign of enjoying commanding popular support among Iraq's Arab population. But the attention he has attracted only serves to highlight the forces that have been unleashed by the Anglo-American war. </p> <p>Until last year, the only group in Iraq linked to al-Qaida operated in the US- and British-patrolled Kurdish area, beyond Saddam Hussein's writ. Now every Afghan jihadist veteran who wants to can stage kidnappings and suicide attacks throughout Iraq: this is Tony Blair's \"cockpit of international terrorism\", conjured into being by his own government. And as the quisling prime minister Ayad Allawi - whose real authority can be measured by the US veto of any release of the Iraqi women prisoners demanded by Kenneth Bigley's kidnappers - declared at the weekend: \"If Iraq is broken, London will be a target.\" </p> <p>The kidnapping of Kenneth Bigley may yet bring home the Iraq war to Britain in a way that months of TV footage of mayhem and misery have failed to do. The focus on his plight has, of course, been in stark contrast to the utter disinterest in the circumstances in which 300 Iraqis have been killed - most by US forces, many of them civilians - in the past week. But there still remains a sense of unreality in public life about the enormity of what Britain has helped to create in Iraq: a \"crisis of historic proportions\", in the words of the US Democratic challenger, John Kerry. </p> <p>By any normal reckoning, the events of the past few days should have triggered a political crisis in Britain. The conclusion of the Iraq Survey Group that there were no weapons of mass destruction at the time of the invasion, the leaked Whitehall documents confirming that Blair was warned in advance of the likelihood of post-war chaos and, crucially, the declaration by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, that the war launched by a British prime minister was illegal should be a lethal combination. </p> <p>The implications, after all, could not be more damning. If Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction by the late 1990s, as is now almost universally accepted, Iraq was evidently not in material breach of UN resolutions. If the war was illegal, as is now believed by most global opinion, then the only people fighting legitimately in Iraq are the resistance groups defending their homeland - not the forces of states that committed an international crime by attacking a country without provocation. That is the war still being fought out on the streets of Baghdad, Basra, Falluja and Ramadi - a war now so discredited that Blair is desperate to redefine it as a \"new conflict\" against terror. </p> <p>That these events have not yet led to a decisive crisis of Blair's leadership is above all a function of the fact that Britain was the only one of the original invading coalition to have a centre-left government - and which has therefore been supported over the fundamentals of the war ever since by the main opposition party. But the underlying damage to both the Labour party and the government by their continuing association with such a catastrophic adventure is likely to have fatal political consequences in its impact on public trust and support. The issue of the Iraq war must obviously transcend the bread-and-butter domestic concerns of British politics. That is not only because of the tens of thousands of innocents who have been killed, but because of the hugely dangerous precedent it has set in international relations and the threat it has created to the security of British citizens. </p> <p> F ortunately for the Labour party, a change of policy on Iraq - and the holding of the leadership that launched the war to account - is not only right in principle, but also in Labour's own interests. Next week, the party's annual conference in Brighton could start that process by voting for an early withdrawal of British troops. It is likely to be the party's last chance before the election - short of a change of leader - to begin to undo the damage to itself and lay the ground for change in Iraq. The omens for a withdrawal vote were yesterday not looking that good. The party machine can deploy all manner of tricks to avoid an embarrassing defeat - and so moribund is much of Labour's grassroots organisation that constituency delegates may not be representative of Labour opinion - let alone the 71% of the public who want a date for the withdrawal of British troops. </p> <p>Some will genuinely believe that, even if the invasion was wrong, withdrawal now would only lead to worse chaos or civil war. That is of course the traditional colonial alibi used to justify occupations, but in the case of Iraq - where most of its people say they want foreign troops to leave now - the argument is more than usually unconvincing. Violence and insecurity are already rampant and significant areas of the country have slipped out of the occupiers' control. Only Iraqis can create a stable future for themselves and it is now clear that there will be no security in Iraq while US and British forces remain. Any elections held under the auspices of the occupier - as are planned for January - will lack the legitimacy to calm the resistance. But what they could do is provide a face-saving context for a negotiated British withdrawal - which could in turn help shift US opinion about the value of its own occupation. What is needed next week is for Labour's conference to speak for Britain - and Iraq. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>British Energy, the nuclear generator, yesterday welcomed a decision by the European commission to approve a government-backed \u00a35bn rescue plan. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, the trade secretary, also welcomed the decision. Two years ago the company stood on the brink of insolvency. </p> <p>The approval, overturning an initial ruling that the state aid was unlawful, is a blow to Polygon, the hedge fund demanding a drastic revision of the plan to give a bigger stake in BE to shareholders. </p> <p>Polygon, which unsuccessfully sought commission backing, faces a US court injunction against its requisition of an extraordinary meeting to approve an alternative rescue plan. </p> <p>The rescue was denounced by green campaigners as \"squandering billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on an unsafe energy system\". </p> <p>Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said the decision paved the way for British Energy's survival. \"It takes full account of comments made by BE's competitors and the need to ensure security of supply at all times.\" </p> <p>BE, which supplies a fifth of Britain's power, has agreed to ringfence its eight nuclear plants, which are to get up to \u00a34bn in government aid over 80 years to cover their decommissioning, and cheaper fuel and reprocessing contracts with British Nuclear Fuels in a separate deal worth some \u00a31.2bn. </p> <p>The group, originally kept afloat by a \u00a3650m government loan, will also set up two divisions to run the coal-fired plant at Eggborough, north Yorkshire, and to operate its direct sales to big commercial customers; the move prevents any use of state aid to cross-subsidise these businesses.</p>",
  "<p>Hank McKinnell, chief executive of Pfizer, the largest, richest, most powerful drug company in the world, with a global headquarters in New York and close links to the US government, opted to spend several days this year being heckled and harangued by the activists at the international Aids conference in Bangkok, a biannual event that has become notorious for the trashing of drug company stalls, the panning of America and the throwing of red paint. McKinnell was the only drug company boss there. </p> <p>Why would a man who earns more than $20m a year and was named 11th in the Fortune rankings of the world's most powerful business leaders, do that? Well, there were contacts to make, he says, but that was not all. \"I'm really here because I believe just as we ask our parents and grandparents what they did in the second world war, I think our children and grandchildren will ask us what we did at the beginning of the HIV/Aids pandemic.\" </p> <p>A few years ago, neither drug companies nor governments showed much concern. But in 2000, when the Aids conference went to the heart of the pandemic in Durban, South Africa, everything changed. </p> <p>\"I think the activism at that meeting caused the world to realise that we had to do something extraordinary here and out of that meeting and in the last four years the world looks quite different - pharmaceuticals are available at very low cost and governments are putting money in. There is not enough yet being done on infrastructure but a lot has been accomplished.\" </p> <p>Some may be surprised by McKinnell's willingness to credit the activists, who consider him part of the problem for insisting on the sanctity of drug patents, which keep prices high. But McKinnell, like a number of high-ranking politicians and businessmen, has been to Africa </p> <p>\"You can't visit Africa and see the epidemic without it affecting you emotionally,\" he says. \"I've been in orphanages with 50 to 60 one- and two-year-olds, all HIV positive. I know they're not going to survive without major intervention for more than six or seven years. All these kids want is a chance to live.\" </p> <p>McKinnell thinks Pfizer has been misunderstood. It was not involved in the notorious South African court case in which 39 drug companies sued the government to block it from importing cheap drugs from other countries. \"Pfizer was not a part of that decision. We thought that was a bad idea. We did not join the lawsuit. The basis of our business is being able to sell medicines to those who can afford them and our part of the bargain is to make them available to those who cannot afford them.\" </p> <p>But there were negotiations. \"Not really. Both sides were kind of dysfunctional frankly,\" he says, adding an extraordinary comment from the arch-defender of drug patents: \"The pharmaceutical industry was kind of standing on their patent rights and I don't know what the government was trying to do. They're only now coming around to an effective programme. I think both sides deserved each other.\" </p> <p>He denies that Pfizer was pushed into donating its drug Diflucan, which treats fungal infections that otherwise kill people whose immune systems are weakened by the HIV virus. He reels off figures: Diflucan is now donated in 22 countries, more than 4m doses have been supplied, 18,000 healthcare professionals have been trained in the use of the drug and 900 clinics can now dispense it in sub-Saharan Africa. \"That didn't exist four years ago,\" he says. \"I know of no other organisation that's done that.\" </p> <p>But he is still criticised. M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res and Oxfam say donations are unsustainable, and depend on the goodwill of the company, that companies like them because they gen erate tax breaks but that they come with strings attached and doctors have to prescribe what they have been given rather than asking for what they need. Rock-bottom prices for poor people are a better long-term answer. </p> <p>McKinnell deftly kicks the sustainability argument into the long grass. \"I don't know why anybody would think an NGO dependent on public funding would be somehow more sustainable than a $50bn corporation like Pfizer that's 155 years old,\" he says. \"We said with the Diflucan programme that the drug will be available for patients we are serving as long as they live. Will we renege on that promise and go away? Sure, we might, just like an NGO might or a government might. Governments are running these programmes too and governments change.There's no sure thing in this world. But we have been around for 155 years.\" </p> <p>But his hard line appears to be soft ening. He has two promising Aids drugs in the pipeline. If they get to market, will he donate them to Africa? \"I don't know yet,\" he replied. \"It depends on the circumstances of each individual market and each individual product and I don't doubt some of them would be donated.\" </p> <p>One of those drugs, Capravirine, known as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, might be useful in cases where the virus has become resistant to other drugs. The other, known only as UK-427 (it was invented in the Pfizer UK base in Sandwich, Kent), is potentially more exciting because it belongs to a new class which attempts to block the virus from entering cells. </p> <p>But this sort of research, from which Africa may benefit in the long term McKinnell says, can only continue if the rich world pays enough for its drugs. He warns that Europe is playing a dangerous game. \"I'm particularly concerned about the policies of some European governments. If they're not willing to support the research-based industry, if they're not willing to pay reasonable prices for new medicines, and continue paying very high prices for old medicines, they're going to destroy the research base in Europe, which is almost done already.\" </p> <p>Pfizer has closed research centres already this year in France, Germany and Italy. \"They've basically become countries that don't welcome innovation ... Increasingly what's happening is that companies are unable to launch new medicines in Europe because the government is insisting on ever-lower prices. And that's just becoming politically unsupportable in the US.\" </p> <p>In fact, low European prices have become a point of contention with Americans who are increasingly aware that they pay the highest prices in the world to companies making vast profits. Many pensioners now travel to Canada and Mexico to get medicines cheaper. But the answer for McKinnell is not lower US prices. Healthcare costs continue to rise in Europe in spite of the clampdown on drug prices and \"hundreds of thousands of high-paid jobs\" are disappearing to America, he says. \"I think we may see a change in European policy. We're going to have to.\" </p> <p>McKinnell switches easily from hardball to softball, one moment attacking European governments and the next describing how Pfizer's Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala will tackle the infrastructure problems that the drug companies always said were a bigger obstacle to treating Aids in Africa than drug prices. It will train 200 doctors, who each agree to train 10 more. </p> <p>\"The point is not that this is an appropriate answer to the challenge, because it's not,\" he says. \"But think if 100 companies or 1,000 companies did the same thing, we'd start making real progress.\" </p> <p>He'll be there for the official launch next month, personally convinced, whatever the activists shout at him, that he will be able to tell his grandchildren he did what he could to help turn around the biggest health crisis in history. Without, of course, compromising the interests of one of the most powerful companies on the planet.</p>",
  "<p>Congratulations. You are an astronaut and you have been handpicked for a mission to Mars. You are at the peak of your physical condition, and your mental powers. </p> <p>And you are in big trouble. \"If you survive the violence of the launch then there is a whole host of physiological problems waiting for you,\" says Kevin Fong who runs a space medicine course at University College London. \"Bone and muscle waste at alarmingly high rates, you feel disoriented because of the effects of weightlessness on your inner ear, your heart can start beating erratically and a large number of astronauts spend the first couple of days feeling sick from space adaptation syndrome. All of this before you start thinking about radiation exposure and psychological stress.\" </p> <p>Britain rejected manned space flight years ago. But Fong is one of a group of British medics who think the topic is too important to ignore. Another is Alyson Calder of Monklands hospital, Glasgow, veteran of a space medicine course in Moscow, who staged a one-day conference on the biological challenge of a mission to Mars. For the first three days, the astronaut is dizzy, nauseous, vomiting. Then, she says, there is something called cephalad shift. </p> <p>\"All this means is that instead of body fluid being pulled downwards by gravity, there is a relative increase in fluid in the thorax and head. That is what gives astronauts the puffy face and bird's legs appearance,\" she warns. </p> <p>Then it gets serious. The body mistakenly senses that it contains too much fluid, and receptors in the heart and carotid arteries start sending signals to the kidneys to make urine, which sends the astronaut heading for the space toilet. Meanwhile, she says, calcium is leaching from the bones into the blood, and the combination of extra urination and bone loss could step up the risk of kidney stones. \"Passing a kidney stone, halfway to Mars, with no hospitals in sight, would not be a good situation to be in,\" she warns. </p> <p>In space, your cardiovascular system is out of condition, your circadian rhythms falter, your immune system weakens and you are sealed in a space about the size of a camper van, trying to get along with three or four others. </p> <p>\"Nine months in a tin can going to Mars, a few weeks there, nine months going back. What's the appropriate lighting in the capsule? Can astronauts, when they get out to Mars, adjust to the Martian day?\" asks Russell Foster, of Imperial College. \"Do we give these individuals an Earth day or do we prepare them for a Martian day which is 24 hours and 38 minutes?\" </p> <p>The problems multiply on Mars. Humans like a bright blue light. Mars is a dim, red environment. Humans are tuned to a \"day\" of on average 24 hours and 11 minutes. So sleep patterns will get out of step with Earth: but Martian explorers will still have to radio their problems to Houston. At 4am, says Foster, you are likely to be as impaired as if you were legally drunk. So the human factor becomes another hazard in an adventure already hazardous enough. Mars has a gravitation tug one third of the Earth's, an atmosphere only 1% as dense as Earth's and an average temperature of -60C. It is also scoured by dust storms, and tiny particles of silicon would be bad news in an airlock, a space suit or an astronaut's lungs. </p> <p>Microgravity is no place for an emergency operation or accident. How would you contain all those floating body fluids? How would you cope with a burst appendix, even with telemedicine help from Houston? Radio signals take 20 minutes each way. That's 40 minutes between \"Now clamp the artery,\" and the panic-stricken question, \"Which is the clamp?\" </p> <p>Some doctors want to work on these challenges, but it isn't easy. Kevin Fong says Nasa and the European Space Agency used to send speakers to his course. \"But given the reticence of the British government when it comes to human space flight the international agencies found it increasingly difficult to justify sending speakers,\" he says. </p> <p>Others argue that even the Russians and Americans have barely begun to confront the hazards. Radiation from explosions on the sun would be so lethal that astronauts would need a \"storm cellar\" in their tiny vehicle. Everything on board - clothes, plastics, food and so on - would release tiny traces of toxic gas, which would slowly build up to poison the life support system. Time and isolation could alter the balance of nature aboard the spaceship, and reshuffle the populations of bacteria and fungi, with a risk of pathogenic infections. So, bon voyage: you are heading into the unknown, with people from whom you can never escape.But you are also are staring back at Earth. </p> <p>\"Everything you have ever known, everybody you have ever heard of, all human history, everything we have ever discovered is on that pale blue dot which you will barely be able to see at times,\" says Ben Douglas, an Edinburgh GP who trained at Nasa's Kennedy Space Centre. \"And we don't really know how people will react to that.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Debate the consequences of space travel at the x-change space special: Exploring Space at the Dana Centre, London SW7, on September 28 at 6.30pm.

  "<p>For most of the last 5,000 years, Iraq was a key centre of scientific knowledge. Mathematics, developed initially for keeping accounts, gradually spread into far more ambitious areas such as predictive astronomy, making use of data painstakingly collected and recorded at the temples of Uruk and Babylon over several centuries. </p> <p>During the first century after the birth of Islam, Muslim armies defeated the Persians and moved into Iraq. Around 762, the Abbasid caliphs established their capital in the newly founded city of Baghdad from where they ruled the vast Muslim empire for the next five centuries. </p> <p>This was the high point of Islamic civilisation, when scholars of various religions from around the world flocked to the Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom), an unrivalled centre for the study of humanities and for sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology and geography, as well as some more dubious subjects such as alchemy and astrology. </p> <p>Drawing on Persian, Indian and Greek texts - Aristotle, Plato, Hippocrates, Euclid, Pythagoras and others - the scholars accumulated the greatest collection of knowledge in the world, and built on it through their own discoveries. </p> <p>These developments in Iraq were made possible by widespread literacy and also by the availability of paper as an everyday writing material. The first paper arrived in Iraq from China, probably along the silk route via Samarkand, in the eighth century - long before it reached Europe. Shortly afterwards, a paper mill was established in Baghdad, and by the end of the 10th century, paper had replaced parchment and papyrus in the Arab world. </p> <p>Probably the most famous mathematician at the House of Wisdom was al-Khawarizmi, known as the father of algebra - a word derived from the title of his book, Kitab al-Jabr. </p> <p>Several important figures are also associated with the southern city of Basra, another key centre of learning. Al-Jahiz, born in Basra in 776, seems to have come from an ordinary background and as a youth helped his father to sell fish. His most famous work was the seven-volume Book of Animals which included his observations on the social organisation of ants, communication between animals and the effects of diet and environment. Altogether, he wrote about 200 books on a wide range of topics, including The Art of Keeping One's Mouth Shut and Against Civil Servants. He died at the age of 92, allegedly when a pile of books in his personal library fell on top of him. </p> <p>Al-Masu'di, who died in 957, spent some time in Basra writing about his travels to India, China and East Africa. As with many scholars of his day, his interests were broad and his writing contained elements of history, geography, sociology and anthropology which, unusually for the time, he approached in an analytical way. He also explored problems in the earth sciences - such as the causes of earthquakes - and was also the first writer to mention windmills, invented by Muslims in Sijistan. </p> <p>Ibn al-Haytham (also known as Alhazen) worked as a civil servant in 10th-century Basra before taking up science. Moving later to Egypt, he became head of a project to regulate the flow of the Nile but, on investigation, he decided it was impossible. This annoyed the Fatimid caliph in Cairo, and Ibn al-Haytham reputedly escaped punishment by pretending to be mad until the caliph died. </p> <p>Among the mathematical problems he explored was the squaring of the circle. He also wrote a seven-volume treatise on optics and the nature of light. This explored reflection from plane and curved surfaces, refraction, and the structure of the eye - though he did not understand the importance of the lens. </p> <p>Iraqi science went into decline, partly because of natural disasters such as floods, but also for reasons that are familiar today: religious rivalries and problems with internal security. In 1258 the Mongols sacked Baghdad and, according to some accounts, the Tigris and Euphrates ran red with the blood of scholars.</p>"
