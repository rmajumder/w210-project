  "<p>Citigroup, the global banking company, yesterday ousted three of its most senior executives in an attempt to restore its battered reputation in Japan. </p> <p>The casualties included vice-chairman Sir Deryck Maughan, one of the few Britons to rise to the top of a major Wall Street firm. </p> <p>Last month Japan's financial regulator ordered the closure of Citigroup's private bank for violation of banking laws. </p> <p>Investigators said the bank failed to conduct proper checks against money laun dering, and they alleged fraud had taken place within the retail unit. </p> <p>Chuck Prince, the group chief executive, has been stung by the scandal and other regulatory and legal problems in the past year; he has vowed to restore high ethical standards. </p> <p>Sir Deryck, 56, the son of Durham coal miner, headed Citigroup's international division as well as being vice-chairman. He rose to prominence on Wall Street when Warren Buffett recruited him in 1992 to head Salomon Brothers in the wake of a bond trading scandal. </p> <p>His career began at the Treasury, which he left in 1979 to join Goldman Sachs. Until yesterday he was regarded as one of Wall Street's great survivors, having stayed with Salomon through the mergers and acquisitions by which it metamorphosed into Citigroup. </p> <p>In the process, Sir Deryck became a pillar of the New York establishment, sitting on the board of Carnegie Hall, the prestigious music venue. He is also a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline. </p> <p>Citigroup made no comment on the departures. Instead, Mr Prince sent a five-sentence email to senior colleagues saying that Sir Deryck, Thomas Jones, head of investment management, and Peter Scaturro, who ran private banking, would be leaving. The memo gave no reason for the departures, even though all three were members of the Citigroup management committee. </p> <p>As well as scandal in Japan, Citigroup has suffered from charges that it manipulated the bond market in Europe in an incident that is being investigated by the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>Last month, Tom Maheras, head of global capital markets, said the bank regretted the controversial \u00a37bn bond trade that left rivals nursing heavy losses.</p>",
  "<b>The present</b> <p> For me, though, the big question is why even those governments which have recognised that Britain cannot escape its European destiny - including, as I have said, the present one - always seem over time to retreat from their initial resolve. Think of John Major's \"Heart of Europe\" speech back in 1991, or Tony Blair's frequent promises to end once and for all the ambivalence and ambiguities that haunt our dealings with other European nations. Why is it that the French can be comfortable with being French and European while we still see a choice between the two? For as long as we define Britishness in opposition to Europeanism, we are doomed.</p> <p>I don't doubt the good intentions of the prime minister. He is more comfortable in his European skin than any of his predecessors since Edward Heath. He also has a huge majority in the House of Commons. So why have good intentions once again given way to political expediency? </p> <p>Iraq provides part of the explanation. But even before Mr Blair chose to stand alongside George W Bush there was ample evidence of the familiar backsliding.</p> <p>One reason - and here I am more sympathetic to pro-European politicians - is that there has rarely been a bipartisan consensus in Britain. In most other member states, the Union is woven into the political fabric. But if we look back on 30 years of Britain's membership there has been only one brief period - for two or three years after the referendum in 1975 - when both of the two largest parties have broadly agreed on Europe. </p> <p>By 1983 the Labour party, which had advocated a Yes vote in 1975, was calling for complete withdrawal from the Community. And by the time Neil Kinnock - with a little help from Jacques Delors - had persuaded his party that Europe was not a capitalist ramp, Margaret Thatcher had set the Conservatives on to their present trajectory. Mr Major's good intentions did not survive the Maastricht Treaty. </p> <p>Earlier this month I listened in despair as Michael Howard gave a speech at the Conservative party conference as hostile to the European Union as any I have heard. </p> <p>The great irony is that the Conservatives' journey along the road of Euroscepticism has coincided with a profound shift in the nature of the European Union. The Monnet vision has dimmed. </p> <p>Looking back we can see that the Maastricht Treaty represented the high water mark of federalist ambition. There has been nothing since comparable to the Single European Act negotiated by Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Enlargement to a Union of 25 has changed irreversibly the political geography of the Union. The Franco-German alliance is no longer sufficient to drive greater integration. And for all the faux alarmism of its opponents, the constitutional treaty codifies and entrenches the balance between the acquis communitaire and the intergovernmentalism promoted by Britain.</p> <p>Yet for as long as the European Union remains a political battleground at Westminster, the Europhobic press and that part of our political establishment and public opinion still trapped in the past has a powerful lever against pro-European governments such as that of Mr Blair. Mr Murdoch's influence on the present government - and it is painfully large - depends on the absence of bipartisan consensus.</p> <p>This though provides only part of the explanation of our reluctant Europeanism. Pro-Europeans need to admit a bigger failure, one that they will have to confront head on if the referendum on the constitutional treaty is to be won. The failure is to describe and explain Europe as it is - to admit that membership of this particular club does involve a diminution of what has been classically understood as national sovereignty and to persuade people that Britain is more prosperous and secure as a consequence. To borrow a phrase, the price is worth paying. </p> <p>From the very beginning those who march under a European flag have been less than honest about the nature of the bargain struck with our European neighbours and of the implications for national sovereignty. Thus the 1971 White Paper on entry declared:</p> <p>\"There is no question of any erosion of essential national sovereignty; what is proposed is a sharing and enlargement of individual national sovereignties in the general interest.\"</p> <p>A Sophist, or for that matter a Jesuit, could defend that particular linguistic construction. But to my mind it dodges a central reality. It represents the failure of nerve which lies at the very core of Britain's reluctant Europeanism. </p> <p> Sovereignty is the truly neuralgic word in this debate. </p> <p>It carries the implication - never properly challenged by pro-Europeans - that Britain does have a clear choice: it can opt for complete freedom of action outside the European Union or surrender its independence to Brussels. Sovereignty, in this mindset, is indivisible. Once passed to Brussels, it is lost to Britain. The debate about our relationship is thus held on ground chosen by Eurosceptics - the Union, they say, is a zero sum game; the only question is whether Britain emerges a winner or loser from the all-night bargaining sessions in Brussels. And more often than not, the sceptics will always claim, it is a loser.</p> <p>Never mind that this argument has long defied the realities of the modern world; that for a medium-sized nation on the edge of Europe, the option of independent action is a mirage. As Michael Heseltine once put it:</p> <p>\"A man alone in the desert is sovereign. He is also powerless.\" </p> <p>The same is true of governments. To consider almost any of the prime responsibilities of government - to provide security and freedom for the citizen, an economic framework in which people can prosper and a safety net for the disadvantaged - is to understand the interdependence that comes with globalisation. </p> <p>Think of the direct impact on Britain of the war in the Balkans, of war and famine in Somalia, of the backing for terrorism of the Taliban in Afghanistan. I keep hearing politicians of all parties insist that Britain will never cede immigration controls to Europe. But we all know, in a nation that has 90 million visitors every year, that control is illusory. It is no accident that the present government finally began to get a grip on the flow of asylum seekers into Britain only when France agreed to close the Sangatte camp outside Calais.</p> <p>To be fair, I have heard Mr Blair make this point about sovereignty - sometimes eloquently so. Thus in 2001 he told the European Research Institute in Birmingham:</p> <p>\"I see sovereignty not merely as the ability of a single country to say No, but as the power to maximise our national strength and capacity in business, trade, foreign policy, defence and the fight against crime. Sovereignty has to be deployed for national advantage. When we isolated ourselves in the past, we squandered our sovereignty - leaving us sole masters of a shrinking sphere of influence.\"</p> <p>My quarrel with the government lies in the distance between such analysis and day-to-day practice. Ministers all too often behave otherwise. Consider the monthly meetings of the Ecofin council of finance ministers. Before each such gathering the Treasury plants in the national press some story or other about how the chancellor is travelling to Brussels to tell his colleagues what's what, to veto this or that new directive, or to explain why Britain's economic policy is infinitely superior to that of other European governments. </p> <p>The temptation is to dismiss such behaviour as just silly - the Treasury at its puerile worst. But, month by month, it returns the argument about the EU to the Eurosceptics' chosen ground, feeding the delusion that Brussels is a plot against our national interest.</p> <p>So too does the language of \"red lines\" used by the government in the negotiations on the constitutional treaty. It is self-evident that every EU government set in advance its own demands and limits in the negotiations. France, for example, has long rejected the European superstate of the sceptics' nightmares. Yet Britain alone feels obliged to frame such bargaining in terms of lines beyond which it will never retreat instead of ground on which it would like to advance. Most of the European press described the outcome of the negotiations on the treaty as a triumph for the British vision of a Europe of nation states. But the government's own choice of language had already determined that the outcome would be seen at home as at best a limited defeat.</p> <p>This perception of Europe as a battleground seeps into the media. The other day the BBC announced a review of its European coverage. It intends to focus particularly on whether it gives due airtime to the Eurosceptics. I have no objection to such an analysis. But measuring how many minutes John Redwood gets to refute Kenneth Clarke seems to me to miss the point. </p> <p>The problem with the BBC's coverage - and, to be fair, that of much of the rest of the media - is that it too reports Europe in terms of them and us, of winning and losing. Rarely does the reporting acknowledge the deeper truth - that we cannot alone control our destiny and that, as Europeans, we can all benefit from shared decision-making.</p> <p>It seems to me that unless and until Britain's pro-Europeans take the sovereignty issue head on - until they explain that Britain cannot shape its own destiny alone and that the sovereignty so beloved of the Sun is a dangerous delusion - it will never be able to properly make the case for European engagement. That means too admitting that the EU is far from perfect - that sometimes the compromises are painful. The point is that, overall, the balance sheet is unequivocally positive. </p> <p><b>The future we cannot avoid </b></p> <p>The future, as Hugo said, is unavoidable.</p> <p>In a week or so the 25 members of the European Union are to put their signature to a new treaty of Rome. This time Britain will be there. But hardly with enthusiasm. When we look around the world everything tells us that we need more Europe rather than less if Britain's national interests are to be advanced. It has always struck me as ironic that the global economic liberalism that Conservatives have espoused since the 1980s has greatly strengthened the case for the political cooperation they abhor. </p> <p>No one can imagine after the events of 11 September 2001 that we are masters of our own security in the face of the threat from al-Qaida terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; few can believe that we can control immigration and asylum flows without the cooperation of our European partners; nor tackle cross-border crime without more coordination between police and judicial authorities across the continent. </p> <p>Climate change reminds us that the environment has no respect for national borders. We need the European Union to promote further liberalisation of world trade to the mutual advantage of poor and rich nations. Alone, Britain would never be heard in the Doha round of trade negotiations; the Union is listened to attentively. </p> <p> As Peter Mandelson has recently said, the emergence of China and India as great economic powers demands more rather than less coherence in Europe if the continent's interests are to be protected.</p> <p>Consider too the competition for energy as demand increases for the world's fossil fuel supplies. Those resources are concentrated in the Gulf, Russia and West Africa and our relationship with those regions will be critical for our future energy security. Britain - or for that matter any other single European country - cannot manage those relationships alone.</p> <p>Interdependence has long been a fact of life. It will become more rather than less so in the coming decades.</p> <p>The painful paradox facing Mr Blair is that he started out in 10 Downing Street determined to rebuild Britain's relations with Europe and has ended up as a prime minister more committed to a special relationship with Washington than any but Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>A vital lesson of the Iraq war should be that we need Europe in order to have a balanced relationship with Washington - an alliance, as Mr Blair has said, based on partnership rather than subservience. I do not doubt that Mr Bush has genuinely appreciated Mr Blair's support. And I have heard senior American officials say that we British have tended to underestimate the influence the prime minister has exercised in the White House. But we should not delude ourselves that the American approach to the relationship with the UK is anything but ruthlessly utilitarianism. US foreign policy has never left room for sentimentalism. </p> <p>And looking at Mr Bush's handling of the most pressing security issues of our times - the rising insurgency in Iraq, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Iran's nuclear ambitions among them - I would be surprised if Mr Blair would claim much of the credit for present US policy. </p> <p>I do not count myself among those who believe that we in Britain have to make an existential choice between the US and Europe - that to be full participating members of the European Union demands that we make enemies of our friends in Washington. </p> <p>Rather, I agree with the prime minister that Britain's economic and security interests lie in an Atlanticist European Union. And looking around the European Union of 25 we can see plenty of others who share that basic ambition - Germany and Italy as well as the former communist states of central and eastern Europe. I also share some of Mr Blair's doubts about Jacques Chirac's multi-polar world. Is French obsequiousness in Beijing so obviously preferable to British deference in Washington? The transatlantic community of values is sometimes exaggerated, but I fail to see how a Europe detached from America could feel more secure. </p> <p>For all that, our reflexes need to be as European as they are American - Britain cannot continue to define its ambitions in Europe in terms of what is acceptable in Washington. </p> <p>Gerhard Schr&amp;oumlder is right when he says the traffic on Mr Blair's bridge is too often one way. The government takes America's views to the capitals of Europe. It should more often take Europe's views to Washington.</p> <p>Another paradox. The future of Britain's place in Europe is now enmeshed in the outcome of the US presidential election on November 2. The conventional wisdom is that a victory for George Bush would be politically the most comfortable for Mr Blair. In fact, the prime minister needs John Kerry to win. A Democratic White House would give Mr Blair an opportunity to rebalance Britain's twin relationships with Europe and the US. The transatlantic alliance cannot now be resurrected in its postwar form. The collapse of communism dissolved the glue long provided by the Soviet threat. Europe is no longer at the centre of America's geopolitical interests; and the American guarantee is no longer the sine qua non of European security. But a Kerry presidency would provide the opportunity for, if not the certainty of, a new relationship between the US and Europe. Britain's strategic interests still lie firmly in the re-establishment of a cohesive alliance, in the rebuilding at both ends of Mr Blair's bridge across the Atlantic.</p> <p>That in turn also requires that the government wins the referendum on the proposed constitutional treaty.</p> <p>So can the British people be convinced? Here, I am at once pessimistic and optimistic.</p> <p>Pessimistic because, like everyone else, I read the opinion polls. </p> <p>And because, for all the fanfare of the prime minister's statement to the House of Commons last April, I see no evidence that the government is mobilising the Yes vote. The word from Downing Street is that nothing serious is to be said about the referendum until after the general election - Mr Murdoch's malevolent influence again. Mr Blair promises then to work his persuasive magic. He might have learned by now that the magic has faded. Even, as I suspect it will be, if the referendum is delayed until mid-2006, the campaign to win it must start now. Instead, the government leaves its pro-European case to speeches delivered by Dennis MacShane on the occasional wet night in Dudley. </p> <p>Yet I am optimistic because in spite of the message of the opinion polls, I suspect that the British electorate has more common sense on this issue than we give it credit for. Look beyond the saloon bar xenophobia of UKIP and most people do not find it that difficult to reconcile their Britishness with the idea that we are part of a larger construct. England's national football team is managed by a Swede, its most successful premiership club by a Frenchman. Where are the demonstrations on the streets against German ownership of Rolls Royce or a Spanish takeover of one of our biggest banks? </p> <p>If the referendum is framed, as it must be, in terms of a choice between continued active involvement in the EU and isolation on the margins of an organisation that nonetheless shapes our future, most voters may well conclude, as they did in 1975, that their heads should rule their hearts. The message that the Yes camp must convey - and it has the virtue of being the honest one - is that the status quo option in the referendum is to ratify the treaty. </p> <p> The British do not want to be isolated. </p> <p>Only the other day William Hague recalled that during the 2001 election campaign he had invited the voters to follow him in saving Britain from the European dragon. In Mr Hague's own candid admission: \"No one came\". </p> <p>That says to me that British pragmatism is alive and well; that, for all that some would like to think that our island status gives us a unique freedom of action, we know that the reality is otherwise.</p> <p>Lord Palmerston famously remarked that Britain did not have allies, only interests. The facts of the modern world are such that interests can only be pursued through alliances.</p> <p>As Hugo so eloquently reminded us, we may be unable to forget the past, but nor can we avoid the future.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>",
  "The claim that the US president and his contender for office are at the whim of Mr Sharon takes conspiracy theories to a new level of absurdity (Bush and Kerry dance to the tune of Ariel Sharon, October 20).

  "<p>A venture into the Persian Gulf has turned sour for BAA, which yesterday announced that it was handing back management of two airports in Oman to the country's government. </p> <p>BAA paid \u00a36.3m for a 25-year deal to develop airports at Seeb and Salalah on September 10 2001 - a day before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. The project was part of the company's effort to diversify abroad and turn itself into \"the world's leading airport company\". </p> <p>However, BAA's private sector consortium has since failed to reach financial agreement on a proposed $190m (\u00a3104m) new terminal at Seeb, which was supposed to open in 2007. </p> <p>The airports will go back into public hands next month, leaving BAA with a one-off loss of as much as \u00a32m after taking into account profits from airport shops. </p> <p>BAA's efforts have been hampered by a downturn in air traffic through the Middle East since the global security crisis began. </p> <p>Competition for passengers has come from Dubai airport, which is the home of the rapidly growing Emirates airline. </p> <p>A BAA spokesman said: \"Political instability has had an effect on the region economically - there are fewer people flying there than there were last year.\" </p> <p>In addition to its seven airports in Britain, BAA also operates in Australia, the United States and Italy. </p> <p>It was keen to gain a foothold in the Middle East with a view to long-term growth in the region's travel and trade. </p> <p>Overseas expansion would allow BAA to reduce its reliance on earnings from Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and other British airports, where its charges are regulated by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. </p> <p>BAA's shares dropped 1p to 565.5p yesterday.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Shire Pharmaceuticals</strong> resisted the FTSE 100's strong downward trend yesterday amid talk that its most important drug may finally be given the all-clear by United States regulators next week. </p> <p>Fosrenol, which helps to remove excess phosphorus from the bodies of patients with kidney failure, has been in front of the US Food and Drug Administration for more than two years. Shire shares suffered a wobble in July after the FDA announced it needed another three months to consider new data involving formulation and dosage. </p> <p>Analysts believe the reason the FDA has taken its time approving the drug is because its active ingredient is a heavy metal, lanthanum, which in other drugs has been linked to brain damage. </p> <p>However, the talk in the Square Mile was that Fosrenol would be given the green light when the FDA meets on Tuesday and that Shire would get a \"clean label\", a critical requirement because it would allow the company to charge more for the drug. Fosrenol is key to Shire's future because its top-selling product, Adderall XR, a treatment for children with hyperactivity disorder, could soon face generic competition. </p> <p>Shire shares closed 2p higher at 524p. </p> <p>In the wider market, the leading shares sank in reaction to a weak overnight performance from Wall Street, which continued yesterday, and a resurgent oil price. </p> <p>The final scores showed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> adrift 38.8 points at 4,616.4, with the mining sector among the big fallers on concerns that tomorrow's GDP figures will show the Chinese economy is starting to run out of steam. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> was the worst hit, falling 18p to \u00a314.21. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the<strong> FTSE 250</strong> slumped 45.1 points to 6,244.6, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index eased 11.1 points to 2,577.9.

Despite trading without entitlement to a 3.7p dividend, its shares closed just 4.75p lower at 238.25p after Merrill Lynch joined the ranks of brokers who believe the company is close to signing a deal with the government for a second tranche of Eurofighter jets. </p> <p>\"We understand that Eurofighter Tranche 2 (and equally importantly Tranche 1 repricing) goes before the Investment Approval Board on October 25th - we believe it will be approved.

  "MPs claimed a total of \u00a378.05m in expenses last year, with over half the amount accounted for by salaries paid to their staff, it was revealed today. <p>The 659 MPs claimed an average of \u00a3118,437 in allowances and expenses on top of the standard backbench salary of \u00a357,485 and generous pension.

  "<p>The government today claimed that its policy of promoting biodiversity is working, after publishing figures showing that long-term decline in Britain's wild bird population is beginning to be reversed.</p> <p>The wild bird population indicator, compiled by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for Ornithology, shows that the overall population of breeding birds in the UK has risen by 7% over the last 10 years.</p> <p>The indicator measures the overall populations of 111 wild birds across the UK, and compares the figures with population levels of 1970.</p> <p>It shows that relatively scarce breeding birds such as the woodlark, Dartford warbler and Cetti's warbler have fared particularly well, together with more common birds such as the woodpigeon and jackdaw. </p> <p>Upland and wetland birds have, on average, increased since 1970, while Britain's coastal bird population has risen by almost 40% since 1970, and by 20% since 1985. Guillemot and gannet numbers have recorded the biggest increase, with only the herring gull and little tern showing a decline. </p> <p>Of the woodland birds, great spotted and green woodpeckers are doing well, but many of the species showing the greatest decline are those birds that breed mainly or solely in woodland, among them long-distance migrants such as the tree pipit, spotted flycatcher and willow warbler. Woodland bird levels are still 15-20% below the level of the early 1970s, according to the figures. </p> <p>But concern remains for the population of those birds reliant on farmland for survival, despite signs that their decline appears to have slowed in the last few years. </p> <p>Farmland bird populations dropped by almost half between 1977 and 1993, and numbers are still at only 60% of the 1970 population. While farmland 'generalist' birds such as the rook are faring well, 'specialists' - those that breed mainly or solely on farmland - have declined by 60% since 1970, with the skylark, corn bunting, tree sparrow and grey partridge numbers all declining considerably. </p> <p>Dr Mark Avery, the RSPB's director of conservation, said: \"The fact that, overall, we have lost six out of every 10 pairs of birds nesting on farmland since 1970 is a national disgrace. </p> <p>\"However, the government will soon offer financial incentives to those farmers keen to put farmland birds back on their land.\"</p> <p>From next year, all farmers in England will be able to join the environmental stewardship scheme, a \u00a3150m government initiative to maintain and improve habitats for birds. </p> <p>According to Defra, some 30,000 farmers are already involved in environmental stewardship, but next year will see a new entry level scheme. </p> <p>Elliott Morley, the environment minister, said: \"Entry-level stewardship is aimed at getting the majority of farmers in England to participate in an agri-environment scheme with a range of simple, low-cost management options.</p> <p>\"These will have the cumulative effect of producing wide-scale benefits for farmland birds, particularly those that are still widely distributed, but whose populations have declined.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The impact of agriculture is a key area where integration of biodiversity is vital to our aims, and we are making good progress with this. The reform of the common agricultural policy was a major breakthrough reducing the environmental impact by removing an incentive to intensify production and requiring compliance with environmental standards.\"</p> <p>Dr Avery added: \"We hope 2003 will be the last year that we see the populations of skylark and its farmland cousins in such bad shape. With more money for wildlife-friendly farming, the challenge now is to encourage farmers to take part in the scheme and put the wildlife back on our land that farmers and everyone else wants to see and hear.\"</p> <p>The wild bird indicator forms one of the 15 headline indicators of sustainable development, and shows changes in the populations of common species of farmland, woodland and native wild birds. Bird populations are considered to be a measure of the health of wildlife and the countryside because of their wide range of habitats.</p>",
  "<p>The head of eBay has hailed the arrival of the online auction site as a \"mainstream shopping destination\" in the UK as the value of goods traded soared by 160%.</p> <p>The rocketing revenues of the site favoured by Cherie Blair were revealed on the day a court case underlined a fraud problem that has accompanied EBay's astonishing rise, with a teenager admitting in a Welsh court that he had duped customers out of more than \u00a340,000 on the site.</p> <p>Over 13 months, the youth, from Pontypool, Gwent, defrauded hundreds of eBay customers. The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to 21 counts of theft and asked for 64 further offences to be taken into consideration at an earlier hearing at Cwmbran Youth Court.</p> <p>The site, which only recently launched its first TV campaign in the UK, now has 144 million users worldwide but has also had to grapple with a recent flurry of negative publicity over fraud and faked goods. </p> <p>Complaints have rained in from everyone from the British Museum, concerned about the sale of illegally obtained relics, to designer labels believing that fake goods are being sold through the site.</p> <p>The teenager offered numerous items, from mobile phones to cameras and expensive electronic equipment, for sale or auction on the eBay website. Customers made bids and paid for the goods but never received them. One buyer was duped out of \u00a32,500. </p> <p>Cwmbran Youth Court heard how the boy set up five different bank accounts to receive the payments. Between August 2003 and September 2004 he conned customers out of tens of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>He spent the money on designer clothes, electronic gadgets and hiring stretch limousines, and even splashed out on a trip to New York with his friends. </p> <p>After his spending sprees he would email his victims to let them know how he had spent their cash. He was finally caught after a flood of complaints by conned customers sparked an investigation. </p> <p>Meanwhile, police in Shropshire have called in the help of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and his squad to help crack another suspected eBay scam involving fake autographed shirts. </p> <p>The manager and club captain Roy Keane were among those asked to sign official club shirts to prove that one sold to a fan from Shropshire was fake. </p> <p>Trading standards officers in Shropshire have confirmed that the autographs show a shirt claimed to have been signed by the entire Old Trafford team is a complete rip-off. </p> <p>Now police in Shepshed, Leicestershire, where the suspected forgery racket is operating, are investigating the shirt and about \u00a335,000 worth of other fake or non-existent sports memorabilia. Police in Shepshed said a man had been arrested in connection with up to 150 alleged fraud offences. He has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. </p> <p>EBay insists it is doing all it can to combat fraudsters. It claims that only 0.01% of the transactions carried out on the site could be confirmed as fraud and that the company is constantly introducing new security features. \"We take online fraud seriously and work hard to ensure that eBay is a safe place to trade. We work closely with the police,\" said a spokeswoman. </p> <p>Chief executive Meg Whitman said that the site, which acts as a giant global car boot sale offering everything from classic cars to used bus tickets, had recorded record revenues and profits for the third quarter, largely on the back of \"spectacular\" international growth. </p> <p>Revenues rose to \u00a3437.7m, up 52% on last year, while net profits soared 77% to \u00a399.7m. \"EBay UK has now gone mainstream,\" said Ms Whitman, alluding to the growing ubiquity of the site in everything from the tabloid press to women's titles. </p> <p>Cherie Blair also gave the company an unexpected PR boost when she hit the headlines for spending 99p on a Winnie the Pooh alarm clock, \u00a31.99 on two Disney videos and \u00a315 on a pair of sandals on the site, under the user name cherie_boo. </p> <p>\"It is now a mainstream shopping destination where everyone goes first when they are looking to buy online,\" said Ms Whitman of the UK site, which helped contribute to an 83% surge in international sales. </p> <p>\"It has hit what we call the 'knee of the curve' where you get that incredible acceleration once you get critical mass in a market place.\" </p> <p>The company is planning further investment overseas, particularly in fast-growing internet markets such as China. It now operates in 30 countries and plans to add more at the rate of three or four a year. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "For the last week, much of the good city of Liverpool has been baying for the blood of Boris Johnson. For those readers who have somehow managed to miss the tale of undiluted dimwittery, Johnson is the thatch-haired Conservative MP and editor of the Spectator magazine who saw fit to run a decidedly unpalatable leader column in the wake of Iraq hostage Ken Bigley's death, claiming that Liverpudlians were \"hooked on grief\", and throwing in some below-belt swipes at the Hillsborough tragedy for added piquancy. <p>Johnson's timing was far from impeccable - the northern dust (it comes from t'pit, don't you know) was still settling following the case of Sue Nelson, assistant chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy who last week rather rudely labelled the town of Wigan \"the arse-end of the world\". The Manchester Evening News valiantly bit back with a list of \"10 things to make any Wiganer proud\" including a collection of local delicacies: \"Pies, Heinz baked beans, Pataks Indian foods, Potters herbal remedies, Uncle Joe's Mint Balls and De Roma ice cream\", a diet which would surely achieve an arse-end the size of the world, were one to follow it with even remote dedication. Still, by the end of the week, it was impossible not to conclude that the north has something of an image problem.</p> <p>Thankfully, the town of Bolton has rallied to the rescue with a dazzling array of promotional postcards to be distributed in cafeterias and hotel lobbies throughout the region. It is, we learn, part of the \"Think you know Bolton? Think again...\" campaign, aimed at revitalising the image of the town, now best known as the home of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights. Not to be out-trumped, Manchester has hired Peter Saville - the \"design guru\", as I believe he is known - to rebrand the entire city.</p> <p>Saville, you may recall, made his name designing album covers for the likes of New Order and Joy Division, and was co-founder of Factory Records. The council challenged him with devising a way of marketing the city last March, and this month he revealed his campaign slogan, \"original-modern\". Manchester, argued Saville, was the birthplace of the industrial revolution and was, therefore, \"the original modern city\". His belief, he explained, was that the city should continue to be defined by those characteristics of being both \"original\" and \"modern\". Do you see?</p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p> But the zaniness does not end there. Oh no. Step forward award-winning architect Will Alsop, whose plans for a \"SuperCity\" of the north stretching from Liverpool to Hull are due to be exhibited at Urbis in January. Alsop's designs would turn the entire M62 corridor into a throbbing metropolis, apparently. \"It may seem radical\", Scott Burnham, creative director of Urbis, conceded to the Manchester Metro News, \"but with people travelling as much as they do it is not hard to envisage a situation where you may work in Manchester, live in Halifax, and spend an evening out at a nightclub in Liverpool.\" Except that you wouldn't have a hope of catching Corrie at 7.30pm should you embark on such an expedition - would you now, Scott? </p> <p>Anyway, Manchester saw two new arrivals this week: firstly, the world's largest transportable wheel, which arrived from Paris for a four-month sojourn in the city. The wheel, which weighs 365 tonnes and features 51,000 lightbulbs, will reside in Exchange Square, offering unrivalled views of the Arndale Centre. Meanwhile, over in Albert Square, the city's Christmas tree has been hoiked up outside the Town Hall 66 days before the big day itself. Well, you wouldn't wish to get caught short, would you? The tree, you may recall, is not a tree at all, but a 50ft high artificial conifer, seemingly hailing from the John Wyndham school of horticulture. The council assured the Manchester Evening News that, though the tree is up, the lights won't be switched on until November 12. So try to ignore the giant green cone until then, please. </p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p>Across the Pennines, rats are running amok in the sewers of Yorkshire. According to the Yorkshire Post, Hull officials are levelling the blame at Yorkshire Water, which they say have failed to fulfil their responsibility to bait the rodents. Research by Hull Council has shown that since Yorkshire Water employed private contractors rather than the council to deal with the rat population, rodent numbers in Richmondshire, York, Doncaster and Sheffield as well as Hull have increased year-on-year. The council suggests that frequent change in contractor and half-hearted baiting measures are principally to blame for the swell in population.</p> <p>\"The method of hanging poison in plastic bags on string down the manholes is not very effective and is inflicting far fewer casualties on the rats than the former methods of its own staff,\" reported the Post. The Pied Piper was not available for comment.</p> <p>_______________________________________________ </p> <p>In Newcastle, there was understandable excitement at the news that offshore wind power industry will generate some 38,000 jobs in the region over the next 15 years. The announcement by the Department of Trade and Industry and Greenpeace came hot on the heels of less heartening employment figures, which showed the number of those claiming unemployment benefits to be 7,000 up on last month.</p> <p>The job surge depends on offshore wind power providing 30% of the UK's energy by 2020. At present, renewable energy accounts for a mere 3% of the total electricity supply, of which 15% comes from wind energy. But the region was hopeful that the jobs would actually materialise - the country's first offshore wind farm was, after all, at Blyth. Doug Everard, chief executive of the New and Renewable Energy Resources Centre in Blyth said the job figures were achievable. After all, he explained to the Chronicle, \"a typical wind farm will be 100 megawatts, 30 times the size of the one in Blyth.\"</p> <p>There was optimism in Merseyside too, following the announcement that a new six-speed gearbox for Ford is to be built at a plant in Halewood, securing over 600 jobs, and hopefully generating hundreds more. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Boris.</p> <p>_______________________________________________</p> <p> Finally, we bring you a Pendolino update: though we have heard rumours that one of Virgin's new high-speed tilty trains succeeded in arriving some 10 minutes early last week, our own experience has found two out of three trains between London and Manchester to be decidedly tardy.

  "<p>Abbey National welcomed the appointment of a Spanish banker at its helm today as Banco Santander Central Hispano outlined its plans for the banking giant. </p> <p>Spain's largest bank said its finance director, Francisco Gomez-Roldan, would take over from Luqman Arnold as Abbey's chief executive from next month. </p> <p>It also confirmed that Lord Burns would remain chairman, working with Mr Gomez-Roldan to lead Abbey into a new era of Spanish control.</p> <p>The appointment - which is subject to the \u00a39bn takeover by Santander gaining regulatory approval - marks the first time Abbey has had a foreign chief executive. </p> <p>Mr Gomez-Roldan was appointed Santander's finance director in 2002, having joined the company two years earlier. He had previously held positions at Banca Catalana and then Grupo Argentaria, which was a consolidation of all of Spain's state-owned banks. </p> <p>He said he was looking forward to moving to the UK and that he had been impressed by the quality of the Abbey team during the past two months. </p> <p>\"We have a big challenge ahead of us, but I am entirely confident that together we will realise the immense opportunity presented by combining the strengths of Abbey and Santander,\" he said. </p> <p>Abbey had already announced that Mr Arnold would leave his role upon completion of the deal. He will continue to work with Santander as a senior adviser to the bank's chairman, Emilio Botin. </p> <p>Lord Burns, who endured a rough ride from shareholders at its recent meeting to approve the deal, said Mr Gomez-Roldan's extensive experience would be invaluable in ensuring the smooth transition to new ownership. </p> <p>Investors in Santander were poised to give the green light to the takeover today, leaving it subject only to approval from the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>Although no formal decision has been made, the FSA recently said it saw \"no material impediments\" to the takeover. </p> <p>The deal will create the fourth largest bank in Europe and the eighth largest in the world.</p>",
  "<p>Climate change, predicted by the UN to change the way most people live over the next 100 years, is the least important of the world's immediate problems, says a group of economists, including three Nobel prize winners, who were asked to prioritise how money should be spent on helping the world's poor. </p> <p>The team of six American and two other economists, brought together by controversial environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg, said it was not worth spending money on climate change because the effects were expected to be far in the future. They recommended that people became rich first and that money should be spent on HIV/Aids, water and free trade.</p> <p>But they were immediately castigated by international development and environment groups, who accused them of \"understanding nothing about the real world\".</p> <p>Mr Lomborg, a Danish statistician whose bestseller The Skeptical Environmentalist created storms of protest when published two years ago by throwing doubt on climate change science, is hailed by free marketeers round the world but is reviled by many scientists.</p> <p>Yesterday he told a meeting of European rightwing thinktanks how he had brought together what he called the \"Real Madrid\" team of \"galactica\" economists.</p> <p>\"A stellar cast came to Copenhagen to reach consensus about how to help the world's poor,\" he said. \"We chose economists because they have long, valuable experience in prioritising things, and they are unaligned and impartial. We said, if we had an extra $50bn [about \u00a328bn] how should it be spent to do the most good in the world? We looked at the world's problems and came up with 32 challenges.\"</p> <p>The economists then considered the potential costs and benefits of spending money on problems like hunger, climate change, communicable diseases, sanitation, water, money laundering and financial instability. Rejecting spending anything on education, slums, terrorism, arms proliferation, deforestation, lack of energy or corruption, they narrowed the list to 10 areas, which they then divided and ranked into a number of initiatives [see list].</p> <p>Top of their wish list by a large margin was spending money on the control of HIV/Aids. \"We found that for $27bn we could prevent 28m cases of HIV by 2010,\" said Mr Lomborg. \"It was the best investment that humanity could do. The benefits would be 40 times as high as the costs.\"</p> <p>The second best option was to spend on food and health, specifically by providing micronutrients for the diets of the 850 million chronically malnourished people mainly in sub-Saharan African countries who need iron and vitamin supplements. A $12bn programme could help them significantly, said Mr Lomborg.</p> <p>Controversially, the eight professors found that the third most cost effective way to spend the money would be to promote free trade, something most of them had made their names doing. Three of the six Americans on the panel, Robert Fogel, Douglass North and Vernon Smith, are Nobel winners and five others are odds-on to win similar honours.</p> <p>Mr Lomborg, who is head of the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute, yesterday accepted that trade liberalisation policies as promoted by the professors would hurt some people.</p> <p>\"There are always winners and losers. We found that getting rid of subsidies and trade barriers had very low costs and high benefits. We reckoned that the benefits could be as much as $2.4bn a year for rich and poor.</p> <p>\"But there is no doubt that free trade is not only good, but the winners far outweigh the losers. I would say free trade is a huge boon to making a better world.\"</p> <p>There was consensus, too, that providing mosquito nets in malarial areas would benefit millions for relatively little money. The team of economists calculated that $13bn spent would halve the cost of treating malaria and give a 500% return oninvestment.</p> <p>Right at the bottom of the economists' list of priorities for humankind came climate change, which Mr Lomborg yesterday said was a problem of the future. Initiatives like the Kyoto treaty, which is expected to be ratified next month and will force rich countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, were all but useless, he said.</p> <p>\"Let's not spend the money on problems we can not do much about. Let's start with the ones where we can do the most good at the lowest cost now. It's a bad economic proposition to spend money here. Global warming will harm people in 100 years when there will be far fewer poor people. The best thing you can do is make people rich.\"</p> <p><strong> Justice</strong></p> <p> In an ideal world, he said, all these problems should be addressed. \"But it is not ideal, so we must focus on how to do most good. This is only an economic ranking. There may be other issues like justice and equity. This is not a coup d'\u00e9tat. We're not trying to take away the politicians' rights to choose.\"</p> <p>The dream team was immediately attacked by a coalition of 18 leading British development and environment groups, meeting 100 yards away.</p> <p>\"This simplistic and rather banal ranking of these problems should not be taken too seriously,\" said Stephen Tindale, the director of Greenpeace. \"It is an example of intellectual illiteracy. All these problems are linked.\"</p> <p>\"They have come up with bizarre conclusions,\" said Andrew Simms, the policy director of the New Economics Foun-dation. \"The simple point is that unless you act to prevent runaway climate change, all the other things which they prioritise - which are generally no-brainer good things - will be wrecked by global warming.\"</p> <p>Mr Lomborg, however, was unfazed. \"The biggest problem is that we all die, yet no one is considering how to solve that. These economists are talking about how much good you can do.\"</p>",
  "<p>Climate change is already devastating the lives of millions of people in the poorest countries, say leading international development charities who yesterday joined green groups to call on the rich to do more to prevent future catastrophe. </p> <p>According to a report from a new coalition of Oxfam, Christian Aid, WWF, Greenpeace and 11 other organisations working to relieve poverty in more than 100 countries, changes in rainfall patterns and an increasing number of weather-related disasters such as floods and droughts are forcing poor people into destitution. </p> <p>\"Decades of progress and development can be wiped out overnight. Climate change is undermining advances in development and preventing countries raising themselves out of poverty,\" says the report compiled by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank. </p> <p>The report, based on field observations and the projections of the world's leading climate scientists, says that poor countries will be affected by man-made climate change far more seriously than rich countries. </p> <p>\"The impacts fall disproportionately on the poor, exacerbating health [problems] and access to adequate food and clean water,\" said Dr RK Pachuri, who chairs the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change. </p> <p>\"Poor farmers in tropical and subtropical countries are dependent on rains and are barely able to achieve a subsistence level of existence. Variations in rainfall, degradation of soil quality and increased frequency of extreme weather conditions could make the lot of peasants far more difficult than it is currently,\" he said. </p> <p>An NEF spokesman said: \"Climate change is the mother of all ecological debts owed by the north to the south. If we let economic development continue based on the profligate use of fossil fuels, we'll be reaping the environmental and financial impact of that.\" </p> <p>Ritu Kumar, of the Indian Environment and Resource Institute in New Delhi, said: \"Poverty is now partly a consequence of climate change. It is being entrenched in poor countries. Droughts are worsening everywhere. When monsoons fail, people go into debt. The problem is not in 100 years' time; it is serious already.\" </p> <p>The groups, which are traditionally suspicious of each other, called for a global risk assessment to determine the likely cost to poor countries of adapting to climate change, and urged rich countries to provide funds for \"the increasing burden\" of climate-related disaster relief. </p> <p>They agreed that rich states had to take the lead in helping the poor to adapt to what the UN expects to be a very different world where sea level rises and increased extreme weather becomes normal. Eight of the 10 warmest years on record have been in the past 12 years. </p> <p>\"Tackling climate change is going to be good for economies,\" said Stephen Tindale of Greenpeace. </p> <p>\"The argument that it costs a lot to address has been comprehensively demolished. It would lead to much stronger economies.\"</p>",

They are caused by mutations in DNA wrapped up in tiny structures called mitochondria, which live in the cell body but not the nucleus and act as microscopic engines, turning sugars into fuel.</p> <p>Unlike the genes in a cell's nucleus, mitochondrial DNA has a negligible effect on our appearance. But if the DNA is damaged, it can disrupt our ability to make energy, leading to conditions as familiar as diabetes, or the more rare Leigh's disease, which causes dementia and is often fatal before children reach their teens.</p> <p>The Newcastle group hopes such diseases might be cured by extracting the nucleus from an affected egg and implanting it into another egg that has had its nucleus removed, but still contains healthy mitochondria.</p> <p>If the research were ever to become a therapy, the resulting children would have DNA from both parents, plus healthy mitochondrial DNA from an egg donor. Does that amount to two mothers and one father? \"We have thousands of genes on our chromosomes but only tens in our mitochondria, so I would describe them as babies with 2.001 parents,\" says Cooke, adding: \"You'd never know what was due to mitochondria and what was down to the environment.\"</p>",
  "Blimey. I think I have an idea as to how Dr Frankenstein felt. By the beginning of this week, a quixotic idea dreamed up last month in a north London pub had morphed into a global media phenomenon complete with transatlantic outrage, harrumphing over journalistic ethics, grave political predictions - and thousands of people from every corner of the planet writing personal, passionate letters to voters in a tiny American district few outside Ohio had heard of 10 days ago. <p>I realised just how much momentum our project to match concerned non-Americans with voters in a marginal US county had acquired when I arrived in Shanghai on Sunday to be handed a message from a local reporter. I rang back expecting a few desultory questions about why a group of Guardian journalists were visiting China but the reporter had a bigger story in her sights: \"Is it possible to make interview about Operation Clark County?\" (There was no sign in her voice of the mild irony with which we had chosen the project's quasi-military name.) When I rang a colleague in London the next morning to tell him about the strangely surreal encounter, he reported that he had just said goodbye to a crew from Japanese TV. CNN were on their way. </p> <p>It's been like that for the best part of a week: Canadian newspapers, Irish radio, US TV networks. Fox has been frothing. Rush Limbaugh has been raving. A quick Google search as I write this produces the Washington Post wondering, \"Can the Brits swing Ohio?\", and the New York Times reporting, in unusually demotic voice, \"British Two Cents Draws, in Sum, a Two-Word Reply: Butt Out\". Elsewhere, detailing the robust response to our campaign, the Arab News in Saudi Arabia asks gravely: \"Can the 'special' US-UK relationship survive?\". </p> <p>Even before the Springfield News Sun of Clark County splashed our campaign across its front page (the paper's charming crime correspondent was assigned to the story because, \"There was no crime in the county today\"), it was pretty clear that we had touched off something bigger than we had anticipated. In the first 24 hours after we published details of the campaign, more than 4,000 people visited our website to be matched with a Clark County voter. A day later the figure had reached 7,000, and by this Sunday, when the site was attacked by a (presumably politically inspired) hacker, we had sent out the names of more than 14,000 undecided voters. Not all of them will be acquiring foreign penpals; rightwing bloggers have been urging Republicans to sign up themselves, and prevent names falling into the hands of Euroweenie leftists. But extrapolating from the hundreds of people who have gone to the trouble of copying us their letters, it's a good bet that several thousand will. </p> <p>The letters have made rather stirring reading - sensitive, thoughtful and warm, if occasionally prone to propaganda, too. \"I'm a cartographer who specialises in digital mapping,\" began one Welsh correspondent. \"Parts of the US are almost as familiar to me as Wales. It's a small country but it was the ancestral home of 18 out of the 56 delegates who signed your Declaration of Independence.\" Another, from Leicester, wrote: \"Please forgive this intrusion. I am writing to you because I care about America a great deal. Let me tell you why. I lived and worked in the USA for 22 years. My dearest friends are American and some of my best memories are of July 4 parties, Memorial Day picnics, and the Thanksgiving feasts partaken with the welcoming families of friends. I close my eyes and I still see the woods and lakes of Connecticut.\" </p> <p>At first the letters came almost exclusively from Britain but as word spread, our inbox began to look more and more like a UN telephone directory. In one of those bits of casual alliteration to which journalists are prone, I had introduced the project with the suggestion that it would offer a way for \"people from Basildon to Botswana to campaign in the presidential race\". Suddenly, they were. \"My country is a new democracy,\" wrote a South African. \"When we set about building our nation from the ruins of apartheid, we looked long and hard at the lessons the people of the USA have learned from more than 200 years of self-government and democracy.\" From Chile came this: \"As someone who has lived in the United States and loves it dearly, events over the recent years have caused great concern to many of us in the world.\" They kept coming, from Norway, and Germany, and Morocco, and Australia, and Uruguay, and Sweden, and Singapore, and China, and Brazil, and Italy, and, yes, France, too. </p> <p>Then came the backlash. We had expected it, of course. Fox-viewing America was never going to embrace our modest sortie into US politics and we knew full well that any individual voter might take exception to the idea of a foreigner writing to offer some advice on how they should vote - our website explicitly urged participants to \"imagine how you would feel if you received a letter from an American urging you to vote for Tony Blair ... or Michael Howard.\" But you couldn't fail to be a little shocked by the volume and pitch of the invective directed our way. Most of it was coordinated by a handful of resourceful bloggers - the ringleader of whom is fittingly published on a site called \"spleenville\" - and much of it was eye-wateringly unpleasant. \"I hope your earholes turn to arseholes and shit on your shoulders,\" was one, more repeatable example of the scatalogical genre. Another memorable mail asked: </p> <p>\"How secure is your building that contains all you morons??? </p> <p>Do you have enough security?? </p> <p>ARE YOU SURE ??? Are you VERY sure ??\" </p> <p>Interestingly, one of the recurrent themes running through the onslaught was an ardent admiration for Tony Blair from the kind of people who might feel slightly out of place in even the biggest of New Labour big tents. Another was a curious obsession with the state of British dentistry: \"MAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOOTH CAPPED. I UNDERSTAND IT TAKES AT LEAST 18 MONTHS FOR YOUR GREAT MEDICAL SERVICES TO GET AROUND TO YOU.\" At times, it felt as though whole swathes of America had suffered an epidemic of Tourette syndrome. </p> <p>So far, so bad. The email onslaught was pretty unpleasant and inconvenient for the 53 Guardian colleagues whose addresses were targeted by the rightwing spammers - several of us received more than 700 mails - but by and large they were the sort of missives that left you feeling relieved you were not on the same side of the argument (indeed, any argument) as the sender. The same could be said of the news this week that Rush Limbaugh had devoted virtually all of one of his three-hour shows to our Clark County project. But a much smaller number of responses demanded to be taken more seriously. Some of them, a trifle portentously, questioned whether something such as the Clark County project is an appropriate thing for a newspaper to be doing at all. Others, a small but increasing number of Democrats among them, suggested that our campaign could be dangerously counterproductive. Americans don't like being told what to do, the argument went. If a load of foreigners write telling the voters of Clark County to vote Kerry, they are liable to do precisely the opposite. Or, as Sharon Manitta, spokeswoman in Britain for Democrats Abroad, put it with preternatural confidence: \"This will certainly garner more votes for George Bush.\" Yikes. </p> <p>It's not as if we didn't consider the possibility that our project might have precisely the opposite effect to that intended. The feature introducing the project included notes of caution from Manitta's colleague, Rachelle Valladares, and a University of Columbia professor. It's just that we didn't believe it. For one thing, it seemed unlikely that our campaign would ever reach a scale that would have any real impact on the election, one way or another. For another, it seemed spectacularly patronising to suggest that the people of Clark County would be so volatile that they would vote one way simply because an individual several thousand miles away had suggested they do the opposite. </p> <p>Finally, there was the special nature of the Anglo-American relationship. I suppose it might be possible, after that nasty business in the run up to the Gulf war, to imagine a less internationally minded American voter taking umbrage at the very idea of receiving a letter from a Frenchman, but aren't we the staunchest and most longstanding of allies? Surely a letter from a concerned Brit would be received more like a plea from an old friend. (And surely it was important that Americans, who have been reminded repeatedly during this campaign of Tony Blair's legitimising support for George Bush's Iraqi adventure, should know that a majority of the British public did not share their prime minister's analysis of world affairs.) </p> <p>Well, it's true that we may have underestimated the number of people willing to put pen to paper and shell out 47p for an airmail stamp, and it's true, too, that one or two residents of Clark County may get a letter from a cheese-eating surrender monkey, but I would still bet my last \u20ac10 that none of them will make their election decision by reversing whatever our long-distance lobbyists suggest. Consider the first reports of Clark County residents receiving Guardian-inspired letters. \"When Dawn Brink went to her mailbox and found a letter from Germany, she was surprised because she knows no one from there,\" relates the Springfield News Sun. \"When she opened it, she was even more surprised to find someone asking her to vote for Kerry. \"It caught me off guard,\" she said. \"But I'm always open to listening to other points of view.\" And here's James Chapman, who got a letter from a woman in Yorkshire on Saturday: \"She said it was an important election and asked me to vote for Kerry. It was very nicely written.\" Chapman already planned to vote for Kerry so the letter was pushing at an open door. Two other residents were less thrilled by their missives but did not think anyone would vote differently as a result of them. </p> <p>As for the question of whether any newspaper should be attempting to influence a foreign election in the first place, I'm torn between answering, \"Yes,\" and, \"Puleeeeeese\". Yes, because I can't see any qualitative distinction between what newspapers have always done without controversy - attempt to sway the few foreign readers they have with leaders urging them to back one candidate or another - and our Clark County project. Some time in the next 10 days or so, the Guardian will run one urging its American readers - several million of them now, thanks to the long arm of the internet - to back John Kerry. In what way is Operation Clark County any more than an inventive way of empowering individuals to do the same? </p> <p>Puleeeese, because we're in danger of taking all this too seriously. It's always tricky, and usually disingenuous, to suggest when something has been taken very seriously indeed, that actually it was all a bit of a joke. Operation Clark County was not a joke, but neither was it entirely po-faced - it was a lighthearted attempt to make some quite serious points. There were plenty of clues to its intended spirit in the feature which launched it. The cover, among other things, featured a bumper sticker \"Kentish Town for Kerry\" - a gentle joke at our own expense, given the London district's reputation as the heartland of Britain's liberal chattering classes. The introduction to the project itself, meanwhile, began: \"Where others might see delusions of grandeur, we saw an opportunity for public service ...\" </p> <p>Somewhere along the line, though, the good-humoured spirit of the enterprise got lost in translation. It's easier perhaps for British readers to recognise that a project launched in G2 - the same section which sought to save Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith by persuading him to pose in front of a poster which read, \"It rained less under the Conservatives\" - was not to be taken in deadly earnest. Reading some American correspondence, you might believe that the editor of the Guardian himself was secreted in a subterranean war room plotting George Bush's demise. </p> <p>Oddly, it seems that it is the folks in Clark County itself who have best recognised the spirit of the enterprise. Local media coverage has been consistently fair and good humoured. Even the spokesman for Ohio's Bush-Cheney campaign replied to the first query about our effort with a wry reference to the events of 1776: \"The last time the Brits tried to persuade us to do something, we started a revolution.\" Nevertheless it feels as if the time has come to let the good people of the county make their minds up in peace. Since sending a Guardian delegation to the county in the last week of the campaign would be bound to prolong the media brouhaha, with unknowable consequences, and since some of the mail we have received brings to mind the old joke about unenviable holidays (first prize one week, second prize two weeks), we have decided that our competition winners will be watching the last days of the campaign from another, more tranquil, corner of the American electoral battlefield. </p> <p>We set out to get people talking and thinking about the impact of the US election on citizens of other countries, and that is what we have done. For the Guardian to have experienced such a backlash to an editorial project is extraordinary, but the number of complaints are thoroughly outdone by the number of people who engaged positively with the project. What other lessons can we draw from Operation Clark County? I guess we will have to wait till November 3 to find out for sure, but here's a provisional stab: there are a huge number of people around the world who are profoundly dismayed by the prospect of another four years of a Bush White House and who are desperate for a way to do something about it; Guardian readers are a reassuringly engaged, resourceful and largely charming bunch; parts of America have become so isolationist that even the idea of individuals receiving letters from foreigners is enough to give politicians the collywobbles and, perhaps, in the digital age little acorns can turn into big trees very, very quickly. </p> <p>Got to run now - the Finnish local elections are coming up on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>Morrisons today revealed a 7.6% fall in interim pre-tax profits, as the supermarket group suffered another hit from the Safeway chain it took over in March.</p> <p>The Bradford-based group reported profits of \u00a3121.6m, down from \u00a3131.6m last year, as it admitted Safeway performance had continued to decline. The results were in line with an update given in July, when Morrisons issued the first profits warning in its 37-year history, blaming falling sales at Safeway.</p> <p>The original Morrisons business saw like-for-like sales increase by 8.9% - or 14.2% including petrol sales - and operating profit jump from \u00a3130.5m to \u00a3209.3m during the half-year. But Safeway stores saw like-for-like sales slump by 7.9%, including petrol, and the business posted an operating loss of \u00a339.0m.</p> <p>Chairman Sir Ken Morrison conceded that \"the task of integration was difficult\". He said: \"There were many operational differences in the way the two companies were organised and the cultures had little in common.\"</p> <p>But he insisted: \"A great amount has been achieved in the last few months which have illustrated what a good business Morrisons is and has convinced me of what a good deal the purchase of the Safeway business will prove to be.\" </p> <p>Safeway stores are being converted to the Morrisons brand at a rate of three a week, which is due to increase soon to a minimum of four a week. Sir Ken, who said the integration process was over and was now a \"pure conversion programme\", added that 41 stores have so far been converted - with 56 due for conversion by the end of the year.</p> <p>As a condition of acquiring Safeway, Morrisons was ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to sell 52 stores where retaining them would have decreased competition. The company said it had so far arranged to sell 43 of the regulatory disposals, and expected to dispose of the remainder by its year end. </p> <p>Morrisons also said \"a great deal of interest\" had been expressed in its Safeway Compact stores and offers were being considered. Sir Ken refused to comment on speculation that 120 stores would be sold to rival Somerfield for \u00a3250m.</p> <p>Morrisons - which beat Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and BHS and Arcadia owner Philip Green to land the Safeway chain - also gave an update on current trading. It said that in the first 10 weeks of the second half, like-for-like sales at unconverted Safeway stores were 10.1% lower, while converted branches had seen a 12.5% increase in sales.</p> <p>An interim dividend of 0.625p per share, an increase of 13.6%, is due to be paid on December 6.

  "Liverpool was last night poised to become the UK's first smoke-free city after its city council voted to ban lighting up in restaurants, pubs, shopping malls and other enclosed work spaces. <p>Liverpool city councillors voted 57 to seven to create a local law to outlaw smoking in such areas. </p> <p>Parliament will now be asked to pass the council's wishes into law. Offenders would face a \u00a31,000 fine if the bill became law. </p> <p>Mike Storey, the leader of Liverpool's Liberal Democrat-run council, said he was thrilled by the vote which he hopes could have a national impact. </p> <p>\"It's an historic moment not just for Liverpool but also for the rest of the country,\" he said. \"We have taken the first step to make sure that becomes a reality. </p> <p>\"I think this will make the government sit up and think about their anti-smoking legislation nationally.\" </p> <p>Mr Storey criticised the health secretary, Dr John Reid, for comments made earlier this year in support of smoking, describing the remarks as \"totally inappropriate\". </p> <p>He added: \"There are dozens of other cities throughout the country that will follow suit and join Liverpool in this ban.\" </p> <p>A thousand people a year in the city died from lung cancer, while 100 non-smokers died from passive smoke. </p> <p>Andrew Hull, the chair of the city's Smoke Free Campaign, said it was only a matter of time before it became law: \"Liverpool will potentially be the first local authority to petition parliament on this issue. There are a number of people whose lives are made miserable because they cannot use pubs and clubs as they have asthma. They are the unheard masses.\" </p> <p>He said a number of busi nesses had been supportive, including the airport, railways, Everton football club and bars and restaurants. </p> <p>But not everyone greeted the news as enthusiastically. </p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said: \"I believe the best route to giving people and especially children a smoke-free environment is through a self-regulatory solution agreed with the industry. </p> <p>\"If that cannot be delivered then targeted legislation may be necessary, but ad hoc initiatives by local authorities is, in my view, the least helpful way of seeking to tackle this issue.\" </p> <p>Liverpool has to petition parliament by November 27 for the bill to be introduced in time for the next legislative session. </p> <p>Ireland has banned smoking in public places and Dublin has declared the move a great success. California and New York City have also imposed bans. </p> <p>Liverpool has been racing its north-west rival Manchester to impose the first British ban. </p> <p>In Manchester, the \"fag break\" is about to become a thing of the past for more than 26,000 council employees as the city aims to become smoke-free. \"The smoke-free city is an idea whose time has come: Manchester should be in the vanguard of this change,\" said a Tobacco Control Report approved by the council's executive last week. </p> <p>Rates of smoking in the two north-west cities are among the UK's highest. The anti-smoking lobby Ash said it had been estimated that exposure to other people's smoke in the workplace caused 700 premature deaths in the UK a year, three times those killed in industrial accidents. </p> <p>Research from Canada suggests employees who smoke cost their employees an average of \u00a31,500 a year through absence and lost productivity.</p>",
  "<b>Iraq troop decision</b> <br> The prime minister insisted no decision had yet been taken on sending British troops to relieve US allies in Iraq. Repeatedly challenged at prime minister's question time, Mr Blair said it was a military decision and would be considered on an operational, not a political, basis. If the Black Watch regiment was asked to stay it would be back home before Christmas. <p>Mr Blair warned: \"We are about to enter a period of increased activity in Iraq. This has nothing to do with the American elections. It has everything, however, to do with the Iraqi elections in January.\" </p> <p>The Tory leader, Michael Howard, said the opposition would not push for a parliamentary vote on any such deployment. But the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said his party would oppose any deployment which did not come at the request of British commanders on the ground. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the request was being assessed \"in the normal way\". He added: \"It is a military request, for operational reasons, and it will be considered on an operational basis.\" </p> <p>The prime minister told the Commons: \"There are some 650 troops involved. I cannot say exactly where in Iraq they are going. But I can say that much of the speculation has been wholly ill-informed and they are not, for example, going to either Falluja or Baghdad.\" </p> <p><b>Scottish regiments cuts</b><br>The prime minister defended plans to cut the number of Scottish regiments at a time when they were involved in Iraq. He said changes were needed to ensure the armed forces could meet modern needs but appeared to hint that the Black Watch could yet be spared the axe. He told Liberal Democrat Sir Robert Smith the armed forces were reviewing the configuration of battalions and regiments. \"I would suggest that we await the outcome of that review because it may not be exactly as you think.\" </p> <p><b>Margaret Hassan held hostage</b><br> Mr Blair paid tribute to the kidnapped aid chief Margaret Hassan and said ministers were doing all they could to secure her release. He said the nation's thoughts were with her. \"She is immensely respected, married to an Iraqi and worked tirelessly to help the country.\" Mr Howard said his party's \"thoughts and prayers\" were with Mrs Hassan's family. </p> <p><b>Jaguar</b><br> The prime minister called for commitments from Ford about the future of Jaguar in Britain. Labour's Jim Cunningham said employees appreciated the government's intervention over the proposed closure of the Brown's Lane factory and asked: \"What progress has been made?\" Mr Blair said he had asked the company and unions to ensure proposals were subject to proper joint scrutiny. \"I also hope they will be able to give commitments about the long term future of Jaguar and indeed Ford in the country.\" </p> <p><b>Means-testing for pension credits</b><br>Means-testing is necessary to lift the poorest pensioners out of hardship, the prime minister insisted. Mr Blair told Tory Hugo Swire the pensioner credit was introduced to help the poorest pensioners, some of whom had been on \"appalling low incomes\". \"Two million pensioners have been lifted out of acute hardship as a result of the measures we have taken.\" </p> <p><b>Youth clubs and education</b><br>Mr Blair faced calls to scrap plans to force youth clubs to meet targets for educating young people. Tory Andrew Selous said: \"Young people work hard all week, often at weekends too. What they want is somewhere they can go to relax and have fun and not be forced to achieve a 'learning outcome' on a Friday or Saturday night.\" Mr Blair said investment in youth services was increasing, adding: \"The best learning outcome is whether they are actually learning the basics in schools\". </p> <p><b>Young offender institutions</b><br>Standards must be considered alongside cost in any moves to contract the running of youth offender institutions to the private sector, Mr Blair told MPs. He said: \"It's important, whatever happens, to make sure that the way that our prisons are run is obviously at its most cost effective but also that we do the best for the juveniles in these establishments.\" </p> <p><b>Apprenticeships</b><br>The prime minister told MPs that the number of apprenticeships would increase to 300,000 by the end of next year amid warnings of a serious skill shortage. He said: \"What is more, we are ensuring that the vocational pathways for 14-19 year olds are now put on parity of esteem with the academic route\". </p> <p><b>NHS dentist shortage</b><br>Tory Anthony Steen protested there were virtually no NHS dentists in south Devon. He suggested unspent funds committed to practices in his constituency be used for homeopathic dental services rather than \"awaiting the promised arrival of bus loads of Polish dentists\". Mr Blair said there were about 2,500 more dentists than in 1997 but more were needed. \"These will all be highly qualified people,\" he said. </p> <p><b>North-east referendum</b><br>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said he was confident the people of the north-east will vote \"yes\" in the referendum on whether to set up a regional assembly. Bernard Jenkin, for Tories, said the Federation of Small Businesses in the north-east has said it would rather money was spent on up-grading the A1 road than on a \"toothless talking shop\". </p> <p>Mr Prescott insisted a regional assembly would be cheaper, costing \u00a312m less than the current arrangements, with 600 fewer councillors and 10 fewer councils. \"More efficient, more effective and the people making their own decisions - that's why I'm quite convinced they'll vote Yes,\" he told MPs. </p> <p><b>Armed forces pensions bill</b><br>The government warned it would scrap its armed forces (pensions) bill, updating pensions and compensation, rather than allow Lords' changes. In what Tories described as a \"belligerent\" move, junior defence minister Ivor Caplin warned peers could not \"cherry pick\" bits of the old and proposed new compensation arrangements. </p> <p><b>US immigration service</b><br>Anger at unfair treatment of Britons at the hands of US immigration officials was expressed by MPs on both sides. They were also concerned at the lack of diplomatic redress over incidents involving shackling and deportation. They protested that the US was not honouring its obligations as an ally by entering into dialogue with British consular staff. However, Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane said protests from the British government had prompted a rule change on cases involving minor infringements of immigration law. </p> <p><b>Child health</b><br> The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, demanded \"a more interventionist approach\" to tackling child health problems. He said during debate on the government's National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity, that asthma, diabetes, alcohol and drugs misuse and poor sexual health were among \"many indicators of children's health that are not necessarily moving in the right direction\". </p> <p>Junior health minister Stephen Ladyman said the NSF involved a \"fundamental change in thinking around the needs of the child\" and had been described by experts as \"the biggest step forward for children for 50 years\". He added: \"It will raise standards in hospitals, GPs' surgeries, schools and nurseries, maternity units and Sure Start children's centres.\" </p> <p><b>Gaelic broadcasting</b><br>A Labour former Scottish minister Calum MacDonald condemned as \"indefensible\" the government's funding of Gaelic broadcasting. He said there was a unique opportunity to set up a dedicated digital television channel but the government appeared \"incapable of willing the means\" to fund such a venture. The culture minister Richard Caborn insisted the issue had been \"high on the political agenda\" and \u00a38.5m was a \"considerable sum of money\". </p> <p><b>English counties</b><br>England's historic county system \"is in the process of being destroyed\" and reforms are needed to preserve a \"vital\" piece of heritage, Tory Adrian Flook said. He told the house people viewed counties as sources of \"identity and affection\" but council changes meant traditional boundaries were being eroded. His historic counties (traffic signs and mapping) bill would see counties marked on Ordnance Survey maps and tourist signs placed on roads to alert people to original boundaries. It gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Customs and excise</b><br>Customs and Excise officers should be told to \"cease imposing their own personal ideas\" of how much drink and cigarettes for personal consumption can be brought home by travellers from abroad, Tory former chancellor Lord Lawson urged. He said: \"Tax law is very clear that anybody can bring unlimited quantities of cigarettes or booze into this country, provided it is for their own personal consumption.\" Lord McIntosh Haringey, for the government, spoke of \"many thousands of cigarettes which are claimed to be for personal use in a number of cases in which travellers have been stopped by customs and excise.\" </p> <p><b>In parliament today:</b><br>The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, and her ministers face the Commons at question time. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, opens a debate on defence in the world. The Lords debates the committee stages of the highways (obstruction by body corporate) bill and the civil contingencies bill and Commons amendments to the companies bill. </p>",
  "<p>Radioactive discharges from nuclear power plants may be more strictly controlled in the light of a government report which finds that the health risk from particles taken into the body may be 10 times greater than previously thought. </p> <p>The report, commissioned by the then environment minister Michael Meacher in 2001, says the existing safety guidelines do not take into account recent scientific studies which indicate a greater degree of uncertainty in judging the risk. </p> <p>Consequently the guidelines either underestimate or overestimate the danger posed by some radioactive materials by up to 10 times, the report says. </p> <p>The findings may go some way to explaining the clusters of childhood leukaemia cases near Sellafield in Cumbria and other nuclear power plants. </p> <p>\"These uncertainties go part way to bridging the gap, but it would be a big jump to say they're sufficient to close the gap,\" said Dudley Goodhead, chairman of the committee examining radiation risks of internal emitters (Cerrie), who produced the report. </p> <p>Despite the lack of hard evidence to link radioactive discharges to cancer clusters, the government might consider imposing tighter controls on nuclear plants as a precautionary measure, he added. </p> <p>\"It's really for the policy makers to recognise the uncertainties. For me, it would mean tighter restrictions on some of the radionuclides, particularly if they're in the environment in the sort of situation where [children] are most likely to be exposed,\" he said. </p> <p>The study was commissioned to re-evaluate the danger of radioactive particles that get into the body, by inhalation, ingestion or in medical procedures. These range from plutonium particles discharged by nuclear plants to substances entering the food chain from rocks and soil. </p> <p>In the body these particles can cause damage to DNA and increase the risk of cancer. </p> <p>The report says that although the risks associated with materials such as caesium are well known those relating to others, especially plutonium in children, are poorly understood. </p> <p>Turning to the risks associated with medical procedures, Prof Goodhead said at his London press conference yesterday: \"It becomes a balance between the medical benefit of the diagnosis and the risk of the procedure. </p> <p>\"Doctors have got to make judgments and part of that surely must be knowing as well as possible what the risk is.\" </p> <p>The report recommends studies to better understand some of the recently discovered effects of radiation. It has been passed to the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment (Comare) which will advise the government directly. </p> <p>Last month Mr Meacher supported a minority report by two members of Cerrie, Richard Bramhall of the Low Level Radiation Campaign and Dr Chris Busby of Green Audit, who resigned and argued that the health effects of manmade radiation had been underestimated by a factor of at least 100. </p> <p>This week he said he feared that \"really important evidence that ought to be in the public domain ... is being suppressed.\" </p> <p>\"The traditional model [used by Cerrie] is based on the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945 and measures the impact of gamma radiation on the body,\" he said. </p> <p>The control samples taken for those studies were from people who lived so close by that they too had ingested traces of residual radiation from dust and debris. </p> <p>\"The only effect measured, therefore, was the impact of radiation from the initial blasts. </p> <p>\"Those living near nuclear reactors are obviously the most vulnerable [to ingesting radioactive material]. </p> <p>\"My belief is that the traditional model may underestimate the [effects] by between 100 to 300 times, possibly more.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was involved in a discussion about internet policing and child pornography the other day. There were a number of suggestions: ID cards, expanding police IT training and so on. None, in my opinion, were likely to have much impact. </p> <p>A cursory search on any of the file-sharing networks reveals the IP addresses of servers distributing child pornography. These \"sick servers\" change frequently, but they are discoverable. That is obvious, otherwise the judges, teachers, policemen et al, convicted of downloading such material wouldn't be able to find it. </p> <p>But what to do about them? Knowing that a sick server in some far-flung former Soviet province is distributing child pornography is one thing, stopping it is another. </p> <p>The scale and distributed nature of this problem makes conventional policing impossible. There are simply not enough resources to track down every sick server, find the people behind them (even if you could), and then prosecute. </p> <p>A more realistic goal may be to disrupt the servers. In many cases, the owners of the servers have no idea they are being used in this way. But if their servers go down, then the distribution of the material will be halted and the owners alerted to the problem. If a web-hosting company sees a server go down, I am sure they will do something about it. </p> <p>One approach might be to capitalise on the internet dynamic of decentralised cooperation. Instead of internet users calling for someone else to police their environment, perhaps they should band together to tackle it themselves. </p> <p>Internet users already cooperate in a distributed, coordinated way to tackle other big problems. The canonical example is the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (Seti). Around the world, users have downloaded screensavers that crunch through the signals picked up from outer space, searching for patterns that could indicate unnatural sources. When they find one, as happened earlier this year, they report the signal to a central system for further investigation. </p> <p>Suppose they were, instead, searching for sick servers? Instead of merely reporting the problem, they could launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. </p> <p>A DDoS attack occurs when PCs connected to the internet (often because of a malicious virus, of which users are unaware) simultaneously try to connect to a website. The target site is swamped, and legitimate users cannot get through. </p> <p>Why not link the automated scouring of the internet for sick servers with the distributed power of screensavers and the DDoS? I am writing this on a plane: at home there are two G4s doing nothing. If I could download a screensaver that either searched for sick servers or obtained a list (from the Internet Watch Foundation) of servers to attack and then cooperated with thousands of other machines to launch DDoS attacks against those servers, I would be doing something to help. </p> <p>The police could spend their time chasing the paedophile sources of the sick content rather than trying to put their fingers in the dyke. My screensaver might become a life saver. Second</p>",
  "<p>Joschka Fischer is the man with the alternative view. As a Frankfurt taxi driver, militant street activist, and then leader of the German Greens, he built a career studying maps, looking for new and different ways forward. </p> <p>As foreign minister and vice-chancellor of Germany, Mr Fischer is still exploring the path ahead. And in a speech before a packed audience of 1,000 in London this week, he showed again why he is one of Europe's most appealing politicians. </p> <p>To a world beset by an unending \"war on terror\", insecurity and cultural strife, and lacking agreed political direction, Mr Fischer offers a positive vision for the 21st century. His formula is both simple and seductive - or, to his critics, naive. While others peddle fear, Mr Fischer offers hope. </p> <p>Far from dwelling on the bitter schism between Germany and the Bush administration over Iraq, Mr Fischer stresses the importance of the transatlantic relationship to both Europe and the US. </p> <p>\"There cannot be world order without the US. It is the only country that can project global power,\" he told a meeting hosted by the London School of Economics and the Centre for European Reform. </p> <p>\"But neither the US nor Europe alone can defend against the totalitarian threat of terrorism. The west must find a way to create a strategic consensus.\" </p> <p>America was struggling in the face of ramifying global challenges, he said. Others were struggling to create counterbalances to US power - an apparent reference to the French president Jacques Chirac's attempts to sustain the concept of multipolarity. </p> <p>But this debate was out of date, Mr Fischer suggested. Globalisation, economic interdependence, limited resources, increased mobility, and the mass media and information technology revolutions were binding countries ever more closely together. Military confrontation would increasingly be perceived as inimical to a state's national interest, he suggested. \"If conflicts happen in the 21st century, the winner will also be the loser.\" Rather, the common threat was that posed by non-state terrorism, failing states and WMD proliferation. </p> <p>A \"second pillar\" must be erected alongside US power, Mr Fischer said, underpinning the new strategic consensus and constructed round a reformed, revitalised United Nations. The UN alone created legitimacy. And legitimacy, not brute power, would be the \"hard currency\" of the coming century. </p> <p>Afghanistan, where Germany is heavily committed, showed what could be achieved if countries acted in concert, he said. </p> <p>Mr Fischer's view of Europe and the EU is every bit as rosy: and again, integration is the key word. He did not envisage a European superstate, he said; every country wanted to retain its own identity, its own cultural differences - and so it should. </p> <p>But a balance must be struck between the demands of nationality and stronger European institutions, thus ratification of the new constitution was of vital importance in fortifying the EU. </p> <p>For Mr Fischer the EU is another success story. Enlargement was now a reality, he said; countries were queuing up to join. And the EU was becoming a global player. But to be effective and efficient, its members needed to integrate, to pool sovereignty and find the tools jointly to deal with security threats emanating from the Middle East, particularly from Iran and the Israel-Palestine conflict, as well as challenges such as the UN's millennium development goals. </p> <p>Mr Fischer is no idealist; and nobody's fool. He has fought on both sides of the barricades, he says, and learned realism and pragmatism. There is no guarantee his map reading is accurate and that his ideas will work. But he remains an optimist for all that. In these dark days, a little hope goes a long way.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, first thing, Boris Johnson MP went for a walk in Sefton Park, Liverpool, where he met a jogger. </p> <p>\"Welcome to Liverpool,\" the man said, according to Boris. \"Never mind the bollocks!\" </p> <p>Of course it could be that the chap was wearing tight Lycra shorts, and he meant that bit literally. Either way, it was a kindly thought - almost the last kindly thought Boris heard all day. </p> <p>He had been sent to the city by his party leader, Michael Howard, after his magazine, the Spectator, published an article about the mourning for the Iraq hostage Ken Bigley. It referred, among other things, to Mersey folk \"wallowing in victim status\". </p> <p>Thanks to some enthusiastic stirring by non-Conservative politicians, this was brought to the attention of the people of the city. </p> <p>As one might paraphrase PG Wodehouse, it is usually possible to distinguish between a Liverpudlian with a grievance and a little ray of sunshine. Boris apologised, but this was not deemed sufficient. He was dispatched north to calm the locals with a bravura display of contrition and repentance. Not only would he be lashing himself with barbed wire, but everyone else in range could lash at him as well. </p> <p>First, though, he was summoned to appear at a sort of inquisition hearing before civic and religious leaders, to crave absolution. \"Two bishops were on standby,\" we were told. Amid much ersatz complaint, Boris declined. And why should he go? This is a free country, and editors who offend cities should not be arraigned, like deviant professors during the cultural revolution. </p> <p>So the locals let rip with their feelings, as if fired from an industrial sandblaster. </p> <p>With his weekly column for the Daily Telegraph out of the way, Boris set out on an \"avoid the people\" tour. Local Tories, who had soon realised that this was all a dreadful error of judgment, tried to keep him well away from everyone except the local press. (The Liverpool Echo was already running a front-page picture of Boris in a clown face). </p> <p>The news leaked as it always does, and we splashed through the rain to find him at the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts, where he performed rather well. </p> <p>He was very sorry, he said, for the hurt caused, and sorry that the article had got the facts wrong about the Hills borough disaster, in which 96 mainly Liverpool football fans died. But he stood by the \"thrust\" of the article. </p> <p>\"It would be mad to say that I had undergone a pre-frontal lobotomy and everything I said last week was no longer operative.\" He had, he said, been \"engulfed by a firestorm of hate\". </p> <p>Then, swiftly putting on his Tory arts spokesman hat, he disappeared upstairs to watch, we learned, \"some people dancing\". </p> <p>Then on to BBC Merseyside, where the phone-in callers were waiting. Boris stood by the anonymous author of the article (whose name we're all pretty sure we know) and blamed himself alone: \"If only I had had the wisdom and never bunged it in.\" </p> <p>The people of Liverpool agreed, though they were split - between those who loathed him and felt he should go straight home, and those who loathed him but thought he should never have come. Those of us not blinded by rage against Boris could detect some scarcely coded attacks on his leader. He, Boris, had thought of coming to Liverpool but had dismissed the idea as a \"a stunt\" - until of course the Tory leader told him to go. </p> <p>And, he added: \"Michael Howard was completely wrong to say that the article was 'nonsense from beginning to end'. I don't think he can have read it properly.\" </p> <p>But the climax of his awful day came when Paul Bigley, the brother of the murdered hostage, phoned in to abuse him. He'd made \"a terrible, terrible mistake ... I don't think any member of the public wants to see you\". </p> <p>Warming to his theme, Mr Bigley continued: \"You are a self-centred, pompous twit; even your body language on TV is wrong. You don't look right, never mind act right. </p> <p>\"Get out of public life!\" </p> <p>As Boris tried to apologise, Mr Bigley went on: \"Get out of private life, and leave us alone!\" Mr Bigley was clearly still grieving. But Boris will never get out of private life.</p>",
  "<p>Every so often a programme comes along that makes watching television not only a duty but a pleasure. We're lucky at the moment: there are two. Green Wing continues on Channel 4 on Fridays, and now the BBC has entirely redeemed itself for any shortcomings real or imagined with <strong>The Power of Nightmares</strong> (BBC2). </p> <p>The first part of Adam Curtis's trilogy of films about global politics was many things. Primarily, it was a forensic examination of how two apparently conflicting ideologies - American neo-conservatism and Islamic fundamentalism - came to rule the modern world. Second, it was a timely blast in the face of political waffle and half-truths, that should be required viewing for anyone allowed to vote in a democracy. Third - and this was by no means the least of its achievements - it solved the age-old problem of documentary film-makers who don't have a lot of original footage to show. Curtis's deployment of archive material was so witty and pertinent that it told the story as much as the words. </p> <p>Curtis focused on two key figures in postwar political philosophy - Egyptian Sayyid Qutb and American Leo Strauss - whose ideas were so similar that you could hardly see the join. Both found Truman's America to be some kind of immoral hell on earth. Both thought personal freedom was the road to perdition. Both their philosophies led, by a maze-like route that Curtis rendered clear, to an unreasoning hatred of the USSR. And when the USSR was out of the way - can you see what comes next? </p> <p>They turned on each other. </p> <p>There's no point in regurgitating Curtis's arguments, not that I'm equal to the job, but there were some highlights worth recalling. Donald Rumsfeld featured as a key player in the Ford administration, banging on about the Red Peril as early as 1975. When the CIA said there was no evidence for weapons of mass destruction, he commissioned a report that used that very lack of evidence as proof of their existence. At the same time, Qutb's disciple Ayman Zawahiri was figuring out that mass murder of \"non-Muslims\" (ie everyone apart from his gang) was justifiable. Rumsfeld went on to we-all-know-what. Zawahiri went on to inspire Osama bin Laden. As this tale unfolded with grisly logic, Curtis bombarded us with sights and sounds that had a logic of their own. He raided archives well - there was some lovely footage of clean-cut American youth at a 50s dance, an image that, to Qutb, proved the hopeless decadence of the west. But it was when Curtis got playful that his cinematic skills really took the breath away. At the end of the film, we saw Taliban fighters dancing to that same schmaltzy 50s groove; never has a complex point about the cyclical nature of history been so deftly made. </p> <p>It's beyond the power of a review column to do more than hint at the richness of The Power of Nightmares, but worth mentioning that the series continues next week and can only get better as it moves closer to the current situation. Documentary of the year, without a shadow of a doubt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the parallel universe that is Sun Hill nick, law-enforcement professionals were spending more time beating up, terrorising and murdering each other than they were in policing this crime-torn quarter of London. At one point Gabriel (Todd Carty) practically throttled June (Trudie Goodwin) against a brick wall - then she calmly got into the car with him to go and sort out a bag-snatching. </p> <p>Back at the station, everyone else was prowling around in a state of nervous exhaustion, sexual arousal or both. I bet they don't prepare you for that at Hendon. It was all getting so tense that when Kerry (Beth Cordingly) got murdered it came as a relief, like a thunderstorm on a sultry day. I love <strong>The Bill</strong> (ITV1) when it lurches into Grand Guignol, and it don't get much grander than this. </p> <p>It's always a relief to see Liza Minnelli alive and working, and she was actually quite funny in a cameo in <strong>Arrested Development</strong>, the hit American show that BBC2 managed to wrest from the competition. She played Lucille Austero, described by a myopic admirer as \"a brownish area with points\", which isn't a bad summation of Minnelli's basic look. Cunningly, the character had to fall over a lot; whether this was an in-joke, or just sound logistical planning, is not for us to say.</p>",
  "<p>HIT Entertainment, the company behind children's television character Bob the Builder, fired its chief executive yesterday and warned of a difficult trading environment next year. </p> <p>The news overshadowed the long-awaited announcement that HIT was to launch a 24-hour digital channel in the United States in a deal which will also see the company's characters watched in more than 100m US homes. Shares fell 11% yesterday to an 18-month low of 195p, the biggest faller in the FTSE 350. </p> <p>Rob Lawes, 37, was ousted unanimously. His sudden departure comes after a profit warning in June and problems in the difficult US market. </p> <p>Company founder and chairman, Peter Orton, who is to take over until a suitable replacement is found, praised Mr Lawes for his \"financial background and relationship with the City\", but added: \"As non-executive directors, we have an obligation to look to the future ... We need somebody who understands how to run channels and also somebody who has empathy with creative people.\" </p> <p>HIT has been criticised for its pipeline of new shows following a string of acquisitions. Two years ago it bought Gullane, which owns the rights to Thomas the Tank Engine stories, as well as Lyrick Studios, the US company behind Barney, the purple dinosaur which has more than 1.5m viewers for its US series. </p> <p>One media analyst, who declined to be named, called the timing of Mr Lawes' departure \"bizarre\". Mr Lawes was credited with pulling off the US deal after 18 months of work. \"To can the architect on the day you unveil this great new edifice is unusual and makes people nervous,\" he said. </p> <p>The US channel, to be launched next September, will be targeted at pre-schoolers in the same way that CBeebies is in Britain. HIT is to invest up to $32m (\u00a318m) over five years for its 30% stake alongside other shareholders PBS, the publicly funded US broadcaster, Comcast, America's largest cable company, and Sesame Workshop, creators of Sesame Street. </p> <p>The channel, which will show HIT programmes and is as yet unnamed, is expected to make a profit in 2008. </p> <p>HIT's pre-tax profits fell 43% to \u00a314.6m in the year to the end of July, on turnover down 12% to \u00a3148m. The company was hurt by the weak dollar: at a constant exchange rate underlying pre-tax profits would have fallen 9% to \u00a336.1m. </p> <p>It was also hurt by the decision taken by Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, to cut shelf space devoted to children's entertainment. The entire industry targeted at children has also been hurt by over-optimistic forecasts for DVD demand as young families continue to buy and watch videos. Bob the Builder has also been off the air in the US for more than a year. </p> <p>Mr Orton, 61, described yesterday's results as creditable in tough conditions, which he expected to continue well into next year. He forecast flat markets until 2006, when the benefits of the US deal were expected to show. \"The US channel deal ... heralds the transformation of the company into a vertically integrated content owner/broadcaster,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Lawes, who started as a TV production company runner when he was 17, joined HIT at its launch in 1989. </p> <p>The former finance director is on a six-month contract and so is expected to receive half his 2003 annual salary and bonus of \u00a3375,000 on his departure. </p> <p>As a sign of its confidence, the company recommended a final dividend of 0.64p, twice last year's 0.32p. Mr Orton yesterday lifted his stake in the company to 6.24% with the purchase of 50,000 shares. He called this deal \"a bargain\".</p>",
  "<p>Care International, one of the only international aid agencies still working in Iraq, yesterday suspended its operation but threatened to pull out of the country completely in response to the kidnapping of Margaret Hassan, its Iraq director. </p> <p>As her Iraqi husband pleaded for her life on Arabic television, there was still no news of which group was holding the aid worker, who was snatched from her car early on Tuesday in a Baghdad street. \"In the name of humanity, Islam and brotherhood, I appeal to the kidnappers to free her because she has nothing to do with politics,\" said her husband, Taheen Ali Hassan. \"My wife has been helping Iraq since 30 years and loved this country.\" </p> <p>Care, one of the largest independent global relief organisations in the world, has taken the lead in trying to negotiate the freedom of its country director, who was born in Dublin and has dual British-Iraqi nationality. \"All relevant avenues are being pursued,\" the organisation said. \"It would not be helpful or appropriate to detail the steps that are being taken.\" </p> <p>Care kept the news of the kidnapping secret for several hours before informing the British embassy in Baghdad, as it used its local network of clerics, hospital workers and tribal sheiks to try and find out who was holding her. The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, said they were working with the British government and Iraqi contacts to seek her release. \"All communication links are being used,\" he said. </p> <p>There are two types of kidnap groups operating in Iraq, those who are politically motivated, such Tawhid and Jihad, the hardline group that murdered the British contractor Ken Bigley, and those who are financially motivated, such as the group that snatched and later released two Italian women aid workers last month. </p> <p>Mrs Hassan, who is believed to be in her 50s, was abducted from her car on the way to work early on Tuesday morning in the Khadra district of western Baghdad. Within hours video footage, showing her looking tired and drawn with her hands tied behind her back, was being shown on the Arabic television channel al-Jazeera. </p> <p>Mrs Hassan has lived in Iraq for more than 30 years, but the country she arrived in during the mid-1970s bears little resemblance to the burnt-out shell it has become. Taheen, her husband, was an engineer and the couple lived in one of Baghdad's smarter neighbourhoods. Mrs Hassan got a job teaching English with the British Council and during an 18-year career rose to become director of the teaching centre, and was highly respected by her colleagues. </p> <p>Everything changed in 1990 when Saddam Hussein launched the invasion of Kuwait. Within four days the UN had implemented stringent sanctions on the country that were to stay in place for more than 13 years. Within a year Mrs Hassan began working for Care, becoming country director in 1992, dedicating her life to providing humanitarian relief, from rebuilding schools and hospitals to supplying medicines for children. </p> <p>\"I just remember her going into the hospitals and pick up horribly deformed children and hugging them with such love and compassion,\" said Felicity Arbuthnot, an Irish freelance journalist, who has known Mrs Hassan since 1991.\"She became not just my friend but my first port of call on every visit. She always knew what was going on on the ground, she always pointed you to people who were reliable.\" But her private life remained just that. \"We became quite close but I never went to her house or really knew anything about what she had done before,\" Mrs Arbuthnot said. </p> <p>Mrs Hassan was a fierce opponent of sanctions and the impending invasion of Iraq, but she was not afraid to criticise the regime - in February last year she condemned Saddam Hussein for building palaces while the country fell apart. </p> <p>One journalist remembers a conversation with Mrs Hassan just before the invasion of Iraq. \"She mentioned something about feeling disconnected from Britain, disbelief that Britain could be part of the war. She was getting calls from home, but she had no intention of leaving. She was angry about sanctions, and the west, but you got a sense that she had married during the good times, had a life of relative privilege, became involved in Care after the sanctions regime began, but somehow was sort of stuck.\" </p> <p>As the US and British unleashed their forces against Iraq, Mrs Hassan continued to lead a team of 60 Iraqi workers supplying hospitals with essential medical supplies, such as insulin, disinfectants and blood-testing kits, while also restoring sewage systems and access to clean water. </p> <p>More than 21 million Iraqis - the majority of the population - are served by water systems funded by Care and over two million people directly benefit from water plants and pumping stations refurbished with the charity's help. </p> <p>Ms Arbuthnot summed up the mood of many who know her yesterday: \"It is so ironic that this person who could have left at any time - in 1991, in 1998, before the invasion last year - that she lived through the grinding sanctions and the bombing, and for it to come to this ...\"</p>",

  "<p>The UK's second largest drugs company, AstraZeneca, has angered hospitals by scrapping the price discounts on some of its drugs, therefore increasing costs for the institutions. </p> <p>NHS sources identified certain respiratory, cancer, gastric and anaesthetic drugs as having \"bulk purchase\" discounts removed or reduced by AstraZeneca this year. The issue has been raised nationally within the NHS. </p> <p>Breast and prostate cancer drug Zoladex and general anaesthetic Diprivan are two drugs that have had the discounts scrapped by AstraZeneca, sources said. </p> <p>The combined cost is not known but is likely to be in the region of tens of millions of pounds. </p> <p>The increase seems to have worsened relations between the company and some hospitals. \"It will have a significant impact,\" said one drug purchasing executive. \"There is a lot of disquiet. You think twice about committing business on other products when they take this line.\" </p> <p>Not all executives were troubled about the changes but at some hospitals, even a small increase has upset this year's budgets. </p> <p>The scrapping of discounts for bulk buying is being increasingly used by drug firms, with GlaxoSmithKline, Wyeth and Pfizer also believed to have adopted the practice to a lesser extent. </p> <p>\"Following an extensive review of the current environment, including the NHS driven unification of primary and secondary care budgets, AstraZeneca has decided to realign some of its hospital discounts,\" said a spokesman for the firm. \"In taking this decision, AstraZeneca has followed the lead of other major pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca is committed to working with our customers that may be affected by this change and will continue to encourage transparent dialogue with the NHS.\" </p> <p>Hospitals are often given discounts by the major companies for buying large amounts of drugs. </p> <p>The benefit to the companies comes because patients are likely to continue with the hospital-prescribed drug when they leave hospital and are under the care of their GP. </p> <p>Pharmaceutical companies have been more careful about their discounting practices since 2001 when Napp Pharmaceuticals was fined \u00a33m for supplying a form of morphine to hospitals much more cheaply than to community pharmacies. The fine was later reduced on appeal. </p> <p>British drug companies are facing an imposed price cut by the government, as a scheme to regulate the amount of profits they make is being renegotiated. Industry executives are expecting a cut in their undiscounted prices of between 5% and 10%. </p> <p>AstraZeneca - which reports third quarter results today - is in the middle of a \"root and branch review\" to increase productivity at the firm via \"streamlining\". However Sir Tom McKillop, the chief executive, has said that there will be no job losses. </p> <p>Before the merger of Swedish firm Astra and Britain's Zeneca in 1999, Astra had a reputation in the British industry of using particularly aggressive sales tactics. This culture is spreading to Zeneca sales staff causing some disquiet for the employees as well as the hospitals. </p> <p>According to Department of Health data, the NHS spent \u00a379m on Zoladex last year when discounts are not taken into account. </p> <p>Yesterday data was released that showed that drug sales around the world have increased by 8% in the year to August, according to research firm IMS Health. </p> <p>Pfizer, the world's largest drugs firm and manufacturer of Viagra, also reported results yesterday and admitted that its sales growth will be hit next year when four drugs lose their patent protection from competitors.</p>",
  "<p>Researchers last night called for further investigation into whether babies born by caesarean section were at extra risk of food allergies and diarrhoea. </p> <p>Children born into families with a history of allergies were monitored as part of a German infant nutrition programme, and it was found that those born by caesarean were twice as likely to be sensitive to cows' milk and other allergens as those born naturally. </p> <p>The babies were also more likely to get diarrhoea up to one year old. Only those born by planned caesarean section at full-term, rather than prematurely, or because of an emergency procedure, were included in the study. </p> <p>Researchers suggested the sterile atmosphere of the operating theatre may deprive infants of bacteria that help their immune systems develop. </p> <p>Caesareans have become an increasingly popular choice in developing countries, provoking debate over the risks to women and babies. </p> <p>The team, from the children's hospital at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, said all the babies in the survey had been breastfed up to four months old. </p> <p>Blood samples were taken at 12 months to check for antibodies to allergens such as eggs, cows' milk protein and soya protein. </p> <p>Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, the team suggests the results are in line with others indicating that gut bacteria are important in developing immune responses. Circumstances linked to the caesarean sections might alter or delay normal bacterial colonisation of the infant's intestines. </p> <p>In all, 855 babies were monitored. \"The colonisation of vaginally delivered newborns is influenced by the mother's vaginal, intestinal and perianal flora, whereas infants delivered by caesarean section are colonised with bacteria from the hospital environment.\" </p> <p>They say reports on the clinical significance of the microbiological findings in babies are scarce and conflicting when it comes to gastrointestinal symptoms. There have also been differences between studies examining the association between caesarean delivery and allergic diseases such as asthma.</p>",
  "In a campaign in which George Bush and John Kerry have shown little compunction for indulging in insults and barbs, it was perhaps inevitable that their wives would be drawn into the fray. <p>Teresa Heinz Kerry drew first blood yesterday, telling an interviewer that Laura Bush had never held \"a real job\", seemingly overlooking the fact that she worked for a decade as a librarian and schoolteacher in the 1970s. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry apologised almost immediately but the gaffe drew expressions of outrage from Republican spin masters who accused the wife of the Democratic challenger of disrespecting America's mothers and homemakers. </p> <p>The would-be first lady had been trying to explain to the USA Today newspaper that she would make a rather different first lady from the demure and retiring Ms Bush. </p> <p>As mistress of the White House, Mrs Bush is viewed as an even more traditional First Lady than her mother-in-law, Barbara Bush. Until the election season got under way - and Mrs Bush proved to be a vote getter - she was rarely visible. Her personal mission as First Lady to promote reading was determinedly low key. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry, in contrast, has said she is determined to carry on with her life's work if she moves to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, managing the philanthropic trusts of the Heinz Foundation . </p> <p>But Ms Heinz Kerry's talent for talking herself into trouble often distracts from her more serious concerns about healthcare and the environment. Earlier this year, she was pilloried for telling a rightwing commentator to shove it, and for telling a heckler at a rally that Mr Bush's re-election would lead to \"four more years of hell\". </p> <p>Yesterday's comments about Mrs Bush's career resum\u00e9 had the same effect. </p> <p>\"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush,\" Ms Heinz Kerry told USA Today. \"She seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job - I mean, since she's been grown up.\" </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry apologised hours later, noting that Ms Bush had indeed worked as a librarian and schoolteacher before marrying at the age of 30 and having twin daughters. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry's spell in the workforce was also brief. After marriage to her first husband, John Heinz, she gave up work as a translator and focused on bringing up their three sons. </p> <p>But Ms Heinz Kerry's apology was not swift enough for Karen Hughes, one of Mr Bush's closest advisers. </p> <p>\"Being a librarian is a real job. Being a teacher is a real job,\" Ms Hughes told CNN television. \"These comments are an unfortunate way of trying to drive a wedge between women who choose to work at home and women who work outside the home.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nanci Griffith's career spans 15 studio albums and her live performances encompass several generations. For a support act, she has enlisted the Crickets, Buddy Holly's former backing band from her home state of Texas. They, in turn, have brought aboard Albert Lee, once of Emmylou Harris's Hot Band, and Robbie Vee, son of 1960s hit-maker Bobby. Then Griffith herself joins in for a few numbers. It's all a bit perplexing for Crickets frontman Sonny Curtis, who suffered a few senior moments while trying to remember which song was coming next and who was playing it, but they managed to find their way through such Holly highlights as That'll Be the Day, Peggy Sue and Rave On. Lee's version of Learning the Game provided an interlude of welcome clarity. </p> <p>Griffith re-emerged for her own set with her acoustic guitar, and thrummed pleasantly through There's a Light Beyond These Woods before introducing her Blue Moon Orchestra. It's a functional combo comprising bass, drums, guitar and piano, but the often startling force of Griffith's voice easily covers any gaps. During one of several interludes, she recalled how someone at her record company predicted that nobody would buy her recording of From a Distance because her voice would scare people off. It duly became her best-known song and a global peace anthem. </p> <p>A Griffith show is a mixture of gathering-the-relatives-round-the-fire and Nanci's bulletin board, as she tells stories, scoffs at George Bush and proselytises about her anti-landmine work. It can get a little cloying (her new song Beautiful, prefaced by a rambling introduction about her stepfather, sank in gallons of treacle), so it's a relief when she slips in a cover version, such as John Prine's Speed of the Sound of Loneliness. </p> <p>For a finale, she recalled the Crickets for a stomping hillbilly version of the Stones's No Expectations, which made you wish she had played more of the same much earlier. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At Olympia, Dublin tomorrow and Saturday.

  "<p>'Some Americans I have spoken with (who were otherwise of quick and rational parts enough) could not, as we do, by any means count to 1,000; nor had any distinct idea of that number,\" wrote the English philosopher John Locke in 1690. </p> <p>He was referring to the Tououpinambos, a tribe from the Brazilian jungle, whose language lacked names for numbers above five. Locke's point was that number names \"conduce to well-reckoning\" by enabling us to keep in mind distinct numbers, and can be helpful in learning to count and to calculate, but they are not necessary for the possession of numerical ideas. </p> <p>Two recent studies of Amazonian Indians reported in the journal Science, take a crucially different view. These studies, far from maintaining that number words are convenient, propose they are actually necessary. </p> <p>The theory that language shapes thought is sometimes called the Whorf hypothesis, after the anthropologist Benjamin Lee Whorf. Berinmo, a stone-age tribe in New Guinea, does not put a linguistic boundary between blue and green but does have a boundary between \"nol\" and \"wor\" within what we would call green. Research by Jules Davidoff, Ian Davies and Debi Roberson showed that the Berinmo categorise blue and green together but nol and wor separately, whereas we do the opposite - see blue and green as separate colours, but nol and wor as variants of the same colour. </p> <p>So if categorising objects by colour can be shaped by colour vocabulary, why shouldn't categorising the number of objects? The idea advanced in the two studies of Amazonian Indian tribes support a strong Whorfian view that number vocabulary is necessary for categorising the world numerically. The idea being tested in the Amazon is that humans, and many other species, are born with two \"core\" systems of number that do not depend on language at all. The first is a small number system related to the fact that we can recognise the exact number of objects up to three or four without counting. We use a second system to deal with numbers larger than four, but it only works with approximations. To get the ideas of larger numbers, of exactly five, exactly six, and so on, you need to be able to count, and to count, you need the counting words. </p> <p>The Pirah\u00e3, a tribe of 150 people who live by the banks of a remote tributary of the Amazon, studied by Columbia linguist Peter Gordon, have words for one and two, and for few and many. That's all. Even the words for one and two are not used consistently. So the question is, do they have the idea of exact numbers above three? </p> <p>Not having much of number vocabulary, and no numeral symbols, such as one, two, three, their arithmetical skills could not be tested in the way we would test even five-year-olds in Britain. Instead, Gordon used a matching task. He would lay out up to eight objects in front of him on a table, and the Pirah\u00e3 participant's task was to place the same number of objects in order on the table. Even when the objects were placed in a line, accuracy dropped off dramatically after three objects. </p> <p>The Munduruk\u00fa, another remote tribe, studied by a French team led by Pierre Pica and Stanislas Dehaene, only have words for numbers up to five. Pica and colleagues showed that the Munduruku could compare large sets of dots and add them together approximately. However, when it came to exact subtraction, they were much worse. </p> <p>Munduruk\u00fa participants saw on a computer screen dots dropping into a bucket, with some dots falling through the bottom. They had to calculate exactly how many were left. The answer was always zero, one or two, and they had to select the correct answer. They were quite good, but not perfect, when the initial numbers dots going in and falling out were five or fewer, the limit of their vocabulary, but many of them were doing little better than guessing when the numbers were more than five, even though the answers were always zero, one or two. Pica and colleagues concluded that \"language plays a special role in the emergence of exact arithmetic during child development\". </p> <p>Tribal societies in the Amazon differ in many ways from a numerate society like ours. The Pirah\u00e3 are essentially hunter-gatherers who rarely trade, and the Munduruku also have little need for counting in their everyday lives. It is therefore very difficult to tell whether it is only the difference in the number vocabularies that hold the key to their unusual performance on exact number tasks. It could be lack of practice at using the ideas of number themselves, in counting or calculating. Pica and colleagues seem to recognise this, since even in the range of their vocabulary, the Munduruku are approximate - \"ebadipdip\" is typically used for four, but also used for three, five and six. The words alone are not enough, they conclude. The number names need to be used to do counting, and some conception of what it is to count must co-exist with the vocabulary. </p> <p>So maybe Locke was right. Counting can exist without number names, but is greatly helped by them. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Brian Butterworth is the author of the Mathematical Brain, and is at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL</p>",
  "<p>The wonder that is the Heineken Cup is upon us, so forgive me for being a party pooper. But there are things about Europe that bug me. </p> <p>No argument, the Heineken Cup is brilliant: the highlight of the club season and at its best something that threatens to nudge internationals out of the limelight. </p> <p>Fans love it and since those first stuttering steps in 1995, when the English clubs dithered about entering, the quality has improved year on year until last spring Wasps beat Munster at Lansdowne Road in arguably the best club game ever played. The final against Toulouse wasn't bad either, with Rob Howley nicking the ball and the winning try from under Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud's nose. </p> <p>And it goes on. This year the prospect is equally mouthwatering with Stade Fran\u00e7ais, Ulster, Cardiff and Gloucester in one group, Bath, Bourgoin and Leinster in another and Wasps, Biarritz and Leicester in the group of death. </p> <p>I've had a few moans about the variable standard of refereeing - especially when Gloucester have been on the wrong end of dodgy decisions - but even then it's part of the adventure of playing in new arenas, part of the joy of not having to tramp around the same old Zurich venues week after week and being bright enough to make allowances for different interpretations of the laws. </p> <p>I'm even prepared to accept one-off quarter-finals, though home and away would probably be fairer. After all, teams who have done well in the pool stage are entitled to something for their labours. </p> <p>No, the two things that get under my skin are playing against sides I don't feel should be in the main competition, and teams that qualify with one set of players and then compete with a new line-up. </p> <p>I have doubts about the fairness of qualifying by winning the Powergen Cup and I'm certain that winning the European Challenge Cup just isn't good enough. Sorry, Newcastle and Harlequins, but if there are six places for English clubs in the Heineken they should go to the top six in the Premiership. </p> <p>And sorry to those non-salary-capped French clubs such as Biarritz who have the likes of Damien Traille and Imanol Harinordoquy among the nine new names registered for this year's competition. The Basque club were pretty formidable last time - ask Sale - and now have 19 internationals on their books compared with the pitiful 13 who got to the semi-finals. </p> <p>Is this whingeing? Possibly. Whistling in the wind? Possibly not. </p> <p>In another part of the forest, the International Rugby Board continues to fret about the global game and the endless search for a worldwide rugby season. I know, we have been here before. But this time there is real momentum for something to happen - and not only because the board has put its hand in its pocket and commissioned Deloittes to sort out the practicalities. </p> <p>The southern hemisphere is in favour and England and Wales have warmed to the idea. Barely a meeting goes by at Twickenham without the marketing men pushing the financial advantages, but it makes sense playing-wise as well. </p> <p>Were the seasons to be synchronised - or at least brought closer together - the internationals played between World Cup years would become more relevant. England wouldn't have to send to Australia and New Zealand a team knackered by a season that was already too long. </p> <p>What does appeal is a programme that begins with an abbreviated (wait for it) domestic programme, moves on to Europe - the six top Zurich clubs in the season competing in the Heineken and the bottom six in the Challenge Cup - and then into the Six Nations, a fierce and fine competition in itself but given the added spice of being preparation for overseas tours. </p> <p>It's the \"abbreviated\" bit which causes a sharp intake of breath, but we are asking our players to play too much rugby. </p> <p>Rubbish international games bolted on to the calendar are a pain, but there is no denying that meaningful Tests fill Twickenham and are the financial engine that drives the game, creating the money that the top clubs and the grass roots all need and all spend. Europe is marvellous and could be enhanced rather than damaged. So something has to give and it may be time to think the unthinkable. </p> <p>In no particular order and with no great affection I offer: do Zurich clubs have to play one another home and away? What about two conferences with end-of-competition play-offs? Or dividing the Premiership into two divisions? And where does the cup stand in the pecking order?</p>",
  "<p>Not so long ago English rugby union players wishing to associate with their league cousins had to assume a false name and keep quiet to avoid being excommunicated by Twickenham. These days there is a greater sense of entente cordiale, as they say in Halifax and Hunslet, but England's head coach Andy Robinson broke new ground yesterday by revealing plans for his side to train against a team from the 13-man code. </p> <p>Arrangements are still at the formative stage, but Robinson's first bold initiative since being confirmed as Sir Clive Woodward's successor is aimed at encouraging his players to look north for inspiration. \"I'm in discussions to train with a rugby league side because I believe we can learn a number of things from them,\" explained Robinson, to the sound of Rugby Football Union dinosaurs spinning furiously in their graves. </p> <p>The 40-year-old coach, however, is deadly serious, and keen to try anything which fosters \"a fresh environment\" as he seeks to rebuild the World Cup-winning squad. With so many league-schooled defensive coaches now working in union, he is also clearly chasing some up-to-date tips on how to outwit them and said he hoped shared training sessions would become a \"regular\" aspect of England's preparations. \"Rugby league is a great game,\" he said. \"It's a completely different game from union but it will be refreshing for our squad to see how the league players play. It's something I want to happen.\" </p> <p>The proposal will not be greeted with universal rapture in the rugby league community, which may well feel it has done union too many favours lately. As a player with Bath, Robinson was among those who had his eyes opened by the cross-code challenge matches with Wigan in 1996, since when a range of league legends including Jason Robinson, Iestyn Harris and Henry Paul have made high-profile switches to union. </p> <p>The cross-pollination is such that two of England's four-man management team - the defence expert Phil Larder and attack coach Joe Lydon - made their names in league while the Super League champions Leeds Rhinos and their union sister club Leeds Tykes share the same training facilities and stadium. Much common ground clearly exists, particularly in terms of coaching methods, as demonstrated by the success at Newport Gwent Dragons of Chris Anderson, who was at the helm of Australia's league team until a year ago and had only a passing interest in union. </p> <p>Nevertheless, some England union supporters are entitled to wonder whether Robinson's first big idea is less innovative than it sounds and is simply a case of a coach trying to steal fresh ideas, magpie-like, off the clever bloke at the neighbouring desk. League officials will also be unimpressed if their top stars end up rubbing shoulders with their 15-a-side peers, like what they find and switch codes themselves. There is also the little matter of finding a mutually agreeable date, with league now primarily a summer sport. As with Woodward's notion of sharing a training session with France, it could just turn out to be a better idea on paper than it proves in reality. </p> <p>Robinson, though, is at the exuberant stage of his tenure where, as he put it, \"no stone is being left unturned\". To stir things up England will no longer be training exclusively in Surrey, as was the case under Woodward, and next week, probably on Tuesday, the 54-man training squad the new head coach inherited will be whittled down to 40 ahead of the November internationals. </p> <p>The former Test flanker has also reiterated his mission statement of making England the first country to win successive World Cups, and made clear that several places \"are up for grabs\" for the Canada Test on November 13, challenging those players struggling for form to up their game. </p> <p>Between now and Christmas, Robinson wants to dispel England's post-World Cup hangover. \"I want to see a real enthusiasm about the way we play. We became very narrow in our approach to win a World Cup and we need to re-introduce more width and creativity into our game.\" As well, it would seem, as a few more northern accents.</p>",
  "<p>Thilan Samaraweera came to Sri Lanka's rescue on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Faisalabad, overcoming cramp to make an unbeaten 97. </p> <p>Sri Lanka finished on 233 for seven after Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami's opening burst had reduced them to nine for three. </p> <p>Marvan Atapattu had chosen to bat on a wicket with a touch of green in it and almost immediately had cause for regret. Shoaib pinned him lbw with the third ball of the day. </p> <p>Shoaib had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip for two in his next over and then Sami had Mahela Jayawardene caught behind for a duck. </p> <p>Samaraweera and Sanath Jayasuriya survived until after lunch, putting on 68 largely painful runs. Jayasuriya, playing his 93rd Test to equal the Sri Lankan record held jointly by Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva, was dropped twice before he lost patience, slashed at a ball from Sami and saw Asim Kamal hold on to a juggled catch in the covers. </p> <p>Runs flowed more freely in the last session but batting was never easy for Samaraweera, who called for a runner after suffering leg cramps. Sami finished with three for 66, Shoaib with three for 55. </p> <p>James Franklin became only the second Kiwi to claim a Test hat-trick as New Zealand took control of their opening Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka. </p> <p>The hosts began the second day on 165 for six but collapsed to 177 all out in eight overs.
