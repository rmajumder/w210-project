  "<p>Lauren Bacall caused something of a media flurry at the Venice Film Festival last week when she interrupted a GMTV reporter interviewing her about the movie Birth, in which she plays Nicole Kidman's mother. 'And now you're working alongside another screen legend, Nicole Kidman,' the reporter began. The husky-voiced Bacall interjected: 'She's not a legend, she's a beginner. What is this \"legend\"? She can't be a legend at ... whatever age she is. She can't be a legend, you have to be older.' </p> <p>Most arts reporters, who are more interested in controversy than art, supposed the 79-year-old Bacall was disparaging her 37-year-old co-star because Kidman had won an Oscar and she hadn't, or because Kidman had been asked all the questions at the press conference for Birth. Well, at her age Bacall has earned the right to deal abruptly with a patronising reporter using language in a loose fashion, and although 'beginner' is hardly the word to describe Kidman, Bacall has a point. </p> <p>She is, after all, a legend who became the widow of a legend, Humphrey Bogart, nearly married another legend, Frank Sinatra, then married a great actor, Jason Robards, who is a legend for his performances in Eugene O'Neill plays, and like O'Neill a legendary drinker. In treating her interviewer in this haughty fashion she was acting out her legend. </p> <p>But what is a legend? And how is a legend different from an icon or someone blessed with charisma? All three terms have been borrowed from the religious sphere and used freely to describe figures in the firmament of our new religions - show business and celebrity. An iconic figure nowadays need be nothing more than a minor representative of some aspect of the culture and need possess no special magic. 'Charisma' was borrowed from the church by US political scientists in the 1950s to describe that extra, indefinable quality possessed by certain public figures. </p> <p>Legends are usually icons, and invariably exude charisma, but they have a special physical and psychic aura that sets them aside from, and above, other people. It does not necessarily make them superior or more worthy, and is not necessarily to do with the truth. In fact, one quality many legends have is that they lie, or are lied about, or have apocryphal stories and jokes attributed to them. </p> <p>The legendary figures of the Wild West like Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp were created by cheap fiction writers in the East while they went about their nefarious ways. Samuel Johnson was a colourful literary figure turned into a legend by James Boswell. Oscar Wilde was a legend less for his work than for his wit, and became a gay icon after his death. </p> <p>The literary critic Northrop Frye identified two kinds of dramatic heroes: the 'high mimetic', who is mythic and detached from his fellow citizens, and the 'low mimetic', who is realistic, superior neither to his environment nor his fellows. You can see this in the western Shane, where a true incident, the Johnson County War of Wyoming, is conducted at two levels - the realistic one between the low-mimetic farmer (Van Heflin) and the big rancher Ryker, and the high mimetic confrontation between Alan Ladd as Shane and the gunfighter Wilson (Jack Palance). The farmer and the rancher engage these larger-than-life legends as their surrogates, just as most of us do in the lives of our imagination. </p> <p>You don't have to be physically impressive to become a legend. Napoleon wasn't, nor was Theodore Roosevelt, one of the three 20th-century US Presidents to become legends. It's useful, however, to have been involved in some struggle, done mighty deeds, or have enacted them on stage or screen. It is also useful to have a self-consciousness that helps promote your own myth. Churchill was and remains a legend, while Attlee, in his quiet way as great a man, wasn't and isn't. </p> <p>Legends usually become so after their deaths, but there are many exceptions. In the 1960s someone, possibly Alan Brien, sent up a Fleet Street and showbiz clich\u00e9 by referring to a fellow journalist as 'a legend in his own lunchtime'. Bogart did not become the immortal he is now until he attained culthood in the 1960s. John Wayne became a legend long before he died, and two Presidents spoke of him as if his battles in the movies were real. Jimmy Carter said: 'John Wayne was bigger than life. In an age of few heroes, he was the genuine article.' Gerald Ford said: 'John Wayne was a unique, magnificent person who met every challenge in his own life and responded to the nation's problems with courage, wisdom and conviction'. </p> <p>Bacall appeared opposite Wayne in his final picture, The Shootist, a central theme of which was Wayne's own legend. Wayne starred with James Stewart (a star, an icon, but not a legend) in John Ford's magnificent western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, a picture about history and mythology. It contains the most famous line spoken by a newspaper man: 'This is the West, sir. When the truth becomes fact, print the legend.' </p> <p>Bacall is probably right: you can't become a legend in your youth, and it's arguable that no one alive and younger than you can be a legend. There is nothing remotely legendary about the straight-speaking, warm-hearted Kidman, who's an infinitely more versatile actress than Bacall, though yet lacking her presence and mystique. </p> <p>But an early death can be the birth of an enduring legend. Someone heartlessly, though accurately, greeted Elvis Presley's death at 42 with the quip, 'great career move'. Rudolph Valentino's movies are rarely seen today, but the adulation that accompanied his funeral in 1926 at the age of 31 helped make him the iconic screen lover and has ensured that his legend has lived on, while other silent heart-throbs like John Gilbert and Ramon Novarro, who survived into the sound era, have been forgotten. </p> <p>The most celebrated screen legend to have died young is, of course, James Dean. His New York apartment off Central Park West and the site of his fatal car crash in Salinas at the age of 24 have become places of pilgrimage. Alec Guinness, who was a great actor but not a legend, contributed to the legend of Dean, and became a minor figure in it, with his oft-told story of having warned the young actor a day before the accident not to make the fatal journey in his Porsche. John Lennon's death in 1981 made him a legend; Paul McCartney is just a rock star. </p> <p>Death in mysterious circumstances can turn stars into subjects of permanent interest, though not necessarily into legends. The strange circumstances surrounding the suicide of Jean Harlow's first husband certainly contributed to her legend, which was established before her death aged 26. And Marilyn Monroe's death at 36 has played a critical part in making her a legend the equal of Presley. The 34-year-old Jayne Mansfield, for a while Marilyn's rival, was decapitated in a car accident, and survives as a comic camp idol, not a legend. </p> <p>It is possible to become a legend and be forgotten, or, as in the singular case of Gloria Swanson, to become a legend for having been forgotten. She was only 53 when she appeared in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard in 1950, but she was nearly as much an absentee from the world of celebrity as the reclusive silent star Norma Desmond she played in the film. When the down-and-out screenwriter Joe Gillis meets Norma/Gloria after seeking refuge in her mansion, he says: 'Wait a minute, haven't I seen you before? I know your face. You're Norma Desmond! Used to be in silent pictures. Used to be big.' To which she unforgettably replies: 'I am big. It's the pictures that got small.' </p> <p>You can be a local legend, but that's more like being a cult figure or just legendary. Such a person was Sidney Morgenbesser, the New York philosopher who died last month aged 82. He never wrote a book but is revered in his academic field for his articles, teaching style and jokes, many of which are apocryphal. He is said to have been approached on the New York subway by a cop who insisted he put out his cigarette, saying: 'If I let you do it, I'd have to let everyone do it.' </p> <p>Morgenbesser replied: 'Who do you think you are - Kant?' and was promptly arrested for using obscene language to a police officer. </p> <p>The most famous of all movie producers, Samuel Goldwyn, owes his reputation to the apocryphal stories told about him and the endless malapropisms and creative uses of the English language known as Goldwynisms that were attributed to him. This made him a legend that transcended the pictures he produced. He's an example of someone deliberately setting out to transform himself into a legend. </p> <p>Lauren Bacall became a legend for marrying and taming Bogart, 25 years her senior, for being his equal as a drinker, smoker, tough talker and independent figure. She was part of his legend, but sustained her own over the years. Her two major stage roles were in Applause , the musical version of All About Eve, and Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth , in both cases playing a big star on the skids. Her legend underpinned the roles, confirming Gilbert Adair's maxim: 'Only a star can play a star.' Sinatra once said of her: 'They will be able to hold the Widow Bogart's wake in a phone booth.' </p> <p>I doubt that, but one thinks, sadly, of Judy Garland's lament: 'If I'm such a legend, then why am I so lonely?' But Garbo, among the most enduring of legends, was constantly surrounded by friends, though best known for supposedly saying, 'I want to be alone.' </p> <p>After writing these words I switch on my email to discover a message from the Turner Classic Movies channel about a film tribute, which begins: 'One of Hollywood's living legends, Lauren Bacall, becomes an octogenarian on 18 September.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Philip French is The Observer's film critic.</p>",
  "<p>Her bullet-riddled body was found last month amid the dense undergrowth of eastern Thailand. Those who stumbled on the blood-soaked carcass described milk still flowing from her breast. The elephant's calf was nowhere to be seen, snatched by her mother's killers along with her valuable tusks. </p> <p>By now the ivory will have found its way to Bangkok, where hundreds of British visitors will have deliberated whether to smuggle it home. It may already be available on the streets of London, home of the UK's flourishing and sophisticated ivory market. </p> <p>In three weeks' time British ministers will arrive in Bangkok for the most crucial talks this year on protecting the planet's wildlife. Yet an Observer investigation reveals the city remains unrivalled as the world's greatest hub for the illegal trade in rare animals. </p> <p>Yet on the eve of the international summit, concern is shifting closer to home. Tens of thousands of Britons and their desire for acquiring anything from snakeskins to tiger pelts to ivory trinkets stand accused of accelerating the slaughter of endangered animals. Their willingness to flout wildlife law has fostered a deep sense of shame among Britain's conservationists. </p> <p>The UK government is also under fire for choosing to remain silent on the scale of Bangkok's trade. Despite receiving a wealth of evidence on the city's role in the smuggling of rare species, ministers have refused publicly to condemn Thailand's failure to quash its slaughter of endangered animals. Some believe Britain should first concentrate on the increasing problems in its own backyard, citing its 'uncontrolled and thriving' ivory market. An investigation for the International Fund for Animal Welfare has identified the UK as the third-biggest source of illegal ivory into the US, one of the world's largest markets. The scale of illegal animal trafficking in Britain is stunning. More than 570 illegal wildlife imports were seized by UK customs officers each day during the most comprehensive analysis of the crisis so far. </p> <p>Environmentalists say the situation is accelerating the fastest extinction of species since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. In Bangkok, evidence suggests it remains as rife as ever. An undercover investigation, yet to be published, by the Dorset-based Monkey World found 38 orang-utans had been smuggled from Thailand into Cambodia over the summer. </p> <p>Director Jim Cronin estimates up to 600 of Asia's only great ape are being kept illegally in Thailand. 'We are talking about the wholesale decimation of the orang-utan by the Thai government. Where has the UK, and the world, been?' said Cronin. </p> <p>Today among the 10,000 stalls of Bangkok's sprawling Chatuchak weekend market, a major draw for British tourists, The Observer was repeatedly told it would be possible to order orang-utans, snow leopards or rare birds by market traders. Similarly sources told Monkey World they could buy an orang-utan for \u00a34,000 but that prices will fall after the spotlight of Thailand's international talks fades. </p> <p>Some Britons will be unable to wait that long. Few, though, are unlikely to match the audacity of Raymond Humphreys, 45. When customs officers opened his suitcase at Heathrow after a flight from Bangkok two years ago, 23 endangered bird species worth \u00a335,000 were found wedged into tight glass tubes. Six had died en route. Later, on top of Humphreys's Norfolk caravan, police came across a present for his wife - a golden-cheeked gibbon, one of less than 1,000 left. </p> <p>A streak of dried blood clung to the inside of the tusk. Viewed from another angle, though, its polished veneer gleamed without blemish: a reminder of why the world's most valuable bone remains craved by so many Britons. This was the finest-quality raw ivory around, hacked from an Asian elephant, each tusk as long as a man's arm and the weight of a six-month-old baby. Unveiled from the dusty backroom of a Bangkok shop last week, the pair were offered to The Observer for \u00a33,500. They came without paperwork and were perfectly illegal. 'I don't care and you don't care; this is ivory,' beamed the proprietor when told of plans to whisk them back to London for sale. His store stood in the centre of the Thai capital, a short cab ride from the huge Queen Sirikit Convention Centre where 5,000 delegates representing more than 160 countries will shortly convene to discuss around 40 proposals on how to improve protection for the most threatened plants and animals. </p> <p>All those about to arrive will know that not only is the elephant the former symbol of Thailand, but it is that of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) too. Yet the host country continues to fail its former icon. </p> <p>Numbers of wild Thai elephants have fallen to fewer than 3,000. Most countries attending will have assumed the killing to have stopped during the run-up to the talks. The fact that ivory can still openly be bought in downtown Bangkok will embarrass figures such as Britain's Environment Minister, Elliot Morley. </p> <p>Of equal concern are the findings of an Observer investigation that has unearthed a trial of corruption, harassment and even death threats as elements within Thailand resist efforts to suppress the trade before the gaze of the world's media arrives. Even the Thai Prime Minister, it has emerged, has come under fierce pressure from the powerful interests that profiteer from the covert smuggling of endangered creatures. </p> <p>Today Thailand's dark secret has become second only to the country's notorious narcotics rings in terms of value. And it is just as dangerous. </p> <p>At first glance, the silver Mazda seen trundling down a dirt track towards the Laos border seemed like just another lost traveller. On closer inspection, highway police noticed the vehicle was carrying a load so heavy its boot sank low above the rear axle. The reason soon became clear. Inside they found the bloody carcass of a huge Bengal tiger sawn clean in half. At 4pm the driver Leuthai Tiewchareun was arrested, by 6pm he was free on bail. </p> <p>Manop Laohapraser - one of Thailand's senior Cites officials and a man whom Morley would expect to meet next month - is reported to have arrived at the scene. Despite his presence, no DNA of the tiger was taken, while a microchip embedded in the creature's neck was never reported, making the tiger's origins impossible to deduce. Yet Leuthai was well-known to the authorities. Undercover investigators had identified him as a major player in an illegal animal smuggling network codenamed Cobra. </p> <p>Last November when police raided his home, it looked more like a zoo. More than 20 pairs of bear paws lay beside piles of fresh tiger meat. His deep-freeze contained the body of a baby orang-utan from Indonesia. Back then, Leuthai had been arrested, but had again jumped his \u00a33,000 bail. </p> <p>Sources say he will be in Bangkok as Morley and the UK delegation touch down for Cites on 2 October. Manop himself is now suspended over his alleged involvement in the sale of 100 Bengal tigers to a Chinese theme park that some believed were destined for human consumption. </p> <p>In addition, evidence collated by WildAid and sent to the Thai authorities reveals that Cobra has links to a police intelligence officer as well as a powerful Thai family. Documents detail the bribes Leuthai's network would pay to Thai border officials such as \u00a3150 for up to 400kg of pangolins, a type of anteater. To date, they provide one of the first insights into the corruption that underpins Bangkok's illegal wildlife network. </p> <p>As profits have grown, so too has the involvement of violent criminals. Even the man appointed to clean up Thailand's illegal trade at the behest of the Prime Minister admits he has been threatened after targeting the biggest players. Major-General Sawake Pinsinchai, head of the Forestry Police, told The Observer: 'There have been several threats in the past. The problem in the past and present is that you are fighting some organisations that are part of a very big network and are very well connected to influential people and politicians.' </p> <p>One prominent conservationist was recently told by a Thai official that he could not even attend Cites. Attempts were even made to discredit Edwin Wiek, who runs the acclaimed Wildlife Rescue Centre in Petchaburi, north of Bangkok. Despite nursing 115 previously sickly and malnourished animals he has been arrested and charged on grounds that have left supporters baffled. Other campaigners have fared far worse. One was recently killed after trying to protect a mangrove swamp from developers. A forestry campaigner was shot dead two weeks ago north of Bangkok. 'I am on the list, by the time you found out how high up you are it's too late', one told The Observer last week in the safety of a guarded hotel. </p> <p>Steven Galster, director of Thailand's WildAid, said: 'People get killed around here for a lot less.' More than 240 wildlife dealers, some with suspected connections to corrupt police and border officials are thought to operate out of Bangkok into neighbouring countries. Leuthai's network covers the whole of south-east Asia and relies on Thailand's 1,800 miles of porous borders. Three hours' drive east from Bangkok lies Cambodia and the region of Pailin, a favoured animal smuggling route. So far this year eight people monitoring the Cambodian side have been killed. Some manage to survive ferocious machete attacks. One man recently required 74 stitches. </p> <p>Such murders are safeguarding a system that involves single shipments into Bangkok worth \u00a36 million. Single cargos of 3,000 pangolins and 600 macaws have been found. Figures passed to the Thai authorities reveal \u00a31.6m of illegal wildlife passed through the city in the six months up to March. </p> <p>'As a trading centre Bangkok is just phenomenal, yet we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg,' said Lincolnshire-born Tim Redford of WildAid, who admits he kept his 'head down' for years while investigating the trade. The level of seeming co-operation between criminals and officials continues to infuriate the country's fledgling environmental movement. </p> <p>A common complaint involves the practice of raids on suspect smugglers being called off at the last minute after a tip-off. Equally important is the dealers' ability to operate with impunity. Hundreds have been arrested, but all, like Leuthai, remain free. No one has received the maximum four years in jail. Yet those like Sawake believe they are starting to make a difference. In just one month 198,465 animals, including tigers and bears, were seized in 656 separate shipments. </p> <p>Deep within the endless suburbs of Bangkok, Safari World has found little trouble luring thousands of UK tourists over the years. A firm favourite among British families are the orang-utans forced to wear garish costumes as they mimic Thai boxers. This week, however, the zoo will find itself at the centre of a storm of international outrage that threatens to cast a shadow over the country's hosting of Cites. A year ago the Thai embassy in London received strong evidence that the orang-utans had been smuggled illegally from Indonesia. Sawake ordered an investigation. The zoo owners replied that they had bred the animals and although they once had 110 of the prized apes 41 had been cremated after falling ill. Their claims were rejected. </p> <p>Finally, police raided the centre and found the remaining creatures. They had been hidden in another part of the zoo. Eight days ago the zoo's vet was convicted of lying to the police. The Indonesian authorities are demanding the creatures be handed back. </p> <p>However, a letter seen by The Observer from the director general of Thailand's department for national parks suddenly claims that they would be suspending action against the owners of Safari World. For conservationists hoping for a symbolic victory against wildlife traders it was a major blow. For Sawake it beggared belief. 'If I am asked to drop the case then you better ask someone else to take over,' he said yesterday. There are increasing signs the British government, whose attempts on tackling wildlife crime are ranked among the best in the world, may raise the issue with the Thai authorities this month. Though for many of the world's most precious creatures it will be too late.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists are claiming that the unprecedented ferocity and frequency of the hurricanes that have battered the Caribbean this year can be blamed on one factor: the unexpectedly warm water that has been building up in the Atlantic over the past year. </p> <p>But some leading US meteorologists reject the idea that this heating is in turn directly linked to global warming. The real villain is the great ocean conveyor belt that ferries warm water from the Equator to the poles, they say. Man-made climate change is a peripheral issue. </p> <p>Every two or three decades, the conveyor belt picks up speed, scientists have discovered, and in doing so warms tropical waters. In turn, this heating alters atmospheric conditions around Africa, the origin of many major storm fronts. Greater storms are created and more make it to hurricane force. </p> <p>According to Eric Blake of the National Hurricane Centre in Miami, sea surface temperatures are now 5C (9F) higher than recent averages and these have been directly responsible for spawning Hurricanes Ivan, Frances and Charley this summer. </p> <p>The end result has been devastation. This is the first time in history that one season has produced two storms that have caused more than $1 billion in damage. Combined, Charley and Frances have resulted in insurance claims of more than $20bn. Ivan is likely to match this. </p> <p>The meteorologists say there is more to come. The warming of the Atlantic that began last year is likely to linger for a couple of decades, creating large numbers of hurricanes. </p> <p>This idea is backed by historical analysis which has shown that from the Forties to the early Sixties, hurricanes were relatively commonplace in the Caribbean. Then came relative tranquillity, when much of Florida's coastal population took up residence in the state. Now they face a return to the bad old days of tropical storms. </p> <p>The images of Hurricane Ivan sweeping over Jamaica have added yet another image of climatic devastation in recent months. Although not directly linked to global warming, they have - along with pictures of wrecked harvests and summer deluges - intensified popular concerns about the climate. These fears will be directly tackled by Michael Howard this week when he gives a speech in which he will demand that Americans co-operate more closely on efforts to cut greenhouse gases. Howard will argue that the Prime Minister has failed to capitalise on his relationship with the White House by getting George Bush to sign the Kyoto pact. </p> <p>'Like the war on terrorism or the drive for responsible free trade, climate change is an international issue that depends on international co-operation,' Howard will say. 'No one can opt out of the fight against global warming. That means persuading the Americans to join the battle against climate change.' </p> <p>At the same time Tony Blair will make his own speech on global warming but will not directly criticise President Bush. However, he will not shy away from pointing out his well-known disagreement with the White House over global warming. 'It's obvious when it comes to issues like climate change that there are differences,' said a Downing Street source. </p> <p>Blair has been repeatedly urged by ministers to make more of his differences with Bush to show voters he is capable of standing up to the Republican right on issues of principle. However, he has less room for manoeuvre than Howard, who has already burnt his bridges with the White House after a public spat prompted by the Bush administration's refusal to grant him photo opportunities with the President.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Stuff Happens</strong> National Theatre, London SE1 </p> <p>At the end of the play, one of David Hare's characters comes downstage to stand in an imaginary Iraq. He asks why nobody has bothered to calculate figures for the Iraqi dead. Then he says: 'Until this country takes charge of itself, it will continue to suffer. If you don't do it yourself, this is what you get!' </p> <p>In other words, 'stuff happens' to those who have lost control of their world. They get tortured, massacred, invaded, bombed or looted. But what happens to those who do control the world, who dish out that stuff? Are they as sovereign as their Texan swagger, French shrug or British snigger suggests? Or are they too in the grip of forces which decide what they will say or do? This is what makes history tough for dramatists. Too much determinism, and you get a masque with puppet characters and wobbling giants guised as Greed or Capitalism. Too much free will, and George W Bush becomes a neat chat-show guest whose lines owe nothing to oil, to patriarchal guilt or to the Ground-Zero hole where his self-esteem should be. </p> <p>This is a hugely ambitious play, but in its scale and scope - not in its ideas about the medium. As political theatre, it compromises. The characters - except for two, Colin Powell and Tony Blair - are sketched and don't develop. In that, Stuff Happens is quite unlike Michael Frayn's Democracy, in which the details of Willy Brandt's betrayal become a fable about two men dreaming of other men they might have been. Hare writes in an author's note: 'This is surely a play, not a documentary, and driven, I hope, by its themes as much as by its characters and story.' But neither are the themes heavily emphasised. This is not agitprop, but imaginative reconstruction by a writer who believes that the meetings which led up to the Iraq war were in themselves wonderfully dramatic. So, to amend David Hare's remark, this play is driven by its story rather than by its themes or characters. </p> <p>On a great round plate of a stage, a crowd of actors is shaken and shuffled into different patterns. There is a Security Council lunch, as the French dismantle Anglo-American hypocrisy over the Iraq resolution. There is Blair at Camp David, circling round Bush like an obsequious tailor trying to pull trousers over the President's hairy intentions. There are White House confabulations, with Colin Powell desperately trying to dilute the 'arrogance' of Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz at the Pentagon. We get the grand 'Mission Accomplished' moment on board the USS Abraham Lincoln, as Bush in his flyer-overall struts up to congratulate his warriors. Meeting after meeting conveys the dire hubris of the whole process, as little men and women (Adjoa Andoh is memorable as Condoleezza Rice) pretend to know what they are doing. </p> <p>And yet this is not anti-war pantomime. David Hare's special strength as a political dramatist is that he takes seriously the cases made by 'the other side'. We saw this to brilliant effect in The Permanent Way, Hare's 2003 play about the decline and fall of Railtrack, in which he used the words of bankers, planners and politicians as they spoke earnestly about their own good intentions. In Stuff Happens, Hare does it again. An audience inclined to easy laughter was reduced to uneasy silence as an actor passionately laid out the moral and political arguments in favour of invading Iraq. Later, President Bush is allowed to become convincing, or at least impressive, in his solo speech justifying the doctrine of preventive war. And, as in The Permanent Way, no character in the play gets to state the full protesters' case. Only individual victims - a Palestinian woman, an Iraqi - speak of what the war and American policy has done to them. And only individuals inside the war machines are permitted to express their doubts, which are usually protests against means rather than ends. Hare is giving his audience credit for intelligence. If the war was wrong, then it is the wordy decision-making itself which must show the audience how wrong it was. </p> <p>Only two figures have real 'life' as dramatic characters, growing and changing as the play develops. These are Tony Blair and Colin Powell. The Olivier shook with mocking laughter as Blair (played almost too cruelly by Nicholas Farrell) stumbled about the world begging for moral reassurance from President Bush. Anxiety gives way to panic as he realises how crude the American approach is, and how thin the evidence that Saddam is a global threat. Tantrum flares when Rumsfeld offers to 'help' him by keeping British troops out of action. Finally, as war is replaced by chaos, he sinks into bruised self-righteousness: 'I wasn't sure what I'd be apologising for. And besides, the moment has gone.' </p> <p>Joe Morton plays the other dynamic figure, Colin Powell. Writing in the Guardian , Robin Cook complained that the play 'built [him] up into a more heroic figure than he deserves'. In Hare's dramatisation, the secretary of state becomes a furious protester against the ruthlessness of the policies being sold to the President by the Pentagon hawks and Condoleezza Rice. He bellows at the French, he yells with anger at Vice-President Cheney, he roars at the President himself. As a performance, Joe Morton brings it off. But as drama, it is weak. When Powell marches off in disgust, are we meant to see him as a noble rebel or a resigned accomplice? Anyway, there is no evidence that cautious Colin ever blew off like this in the White House, or anywhere else. He is known to have disliked the war, but he certainly did nothing noticeable to stop it. </p> <p>Does the play work? Public interest in it is enormous, and gun-jumping reviews have filled the papers. But the audience seemed to leave the theatre feeling slightly unfulfilled. In spite of all its wit, this play lacks the tautness and structural boldness of David Hare's best work. The mixture of one- and two-dimensional characters is awkward. The lesson - that the weak will be wasted by second-rate chancers who have guns, money and a plausible ideology - is well demonstrated, but without surprises. What about that tsunami of public wrath which ran round the world in 2003? Stuff Happens reminds us of what we understood then, but not of what we felt.</p>",
  "<p> <strong>Super Size Me </strong><br>(96 mins, 12A) <br>Directed by Morgan Spurlock</p> <p>From the maggots in the sailors' meat in The Battleship Potemkin to the magnificent banquet served to the sad old-timers in Babette's Feast, food in its most disgusting and delightful forms has been a major feature of the movies. Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me, a polemical, knockabout documentary in the Michael Moore manner, belongs very much to the disgusting, puritanical branch of the food genre. </p> <p>It follows on from Marco Ferreri's La Grande Bouffe, in which Marcello Mastroianni and some chums set out to kill themselves in an orgy of food and sex, and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, where the disgusting gourmand Mr Creosote eats until he explodes all over a restaurant. </p> <p>Spurlock, a New York-based movie-maker and playwright, whose first feature-length film this is, has addressed himself to the problems posed by the worldwide spread of fast-food chains and the rise in obesity. Spurlock becomes Sherlock as he investigates 'The Case of the Expanding Waistline', and he's put himself at the centre of the story. </p> <p>An engaging, articulate, self-deprecating man in his thirties, he decided to become the guinea pig in an experiment as dangerous as the crazy stunts in the TV series Jackass, and as artistically motivated as Robert De Niro and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger putting on weight to lend authenticity to roles. </p> <p>He set out to live for a month by eating three meals a day bought at McDonald's, which has 30,000 branches in more than 100 countries; there's even one in a New York hospital: 'At least you're closer when the coronary kicks in,' he observes. A battery of doctors and nutritionists examines him before he sets out, then monitor his progress. </p> <p>Things don't go well as he edges towards joining the 50 per cent of Americans who are clinically obese, and risks becoming one of the 400,000 who die each year of obesity-related illnesses.

  "<p> From the maggots in the sailors' meat in The Battleship Potemkin to the magnificent banquet served to the sad old-timers in Babette's Feast, food in its most disgusting and delightful forms has been a major feature of the movies. Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me, a polemical, knockabout documentary in the Michael Moore manner, belongs very much to the disgusting, puritanical branch of the food genre. </p> <p>It follows on from Marco Ferreri's La Grande Bouffe, in which Marcello Mastroianni and some chums set out to kill themselves in an orgy of food and sex, and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, where the disgusting gourmand Mr Creosote eats until he explodes all over a restaurant. </p> <p>Spurlock, a New York-based movie-maker and playwright, whose first feature-length film this is, has addressed himself to the problems posed by the worldwide spread of fast-food chains and the rise in obesity. Spurlock becomes Sherlock as he investigates 'The Case of the Expanding Waistline', and he's put himself at the centre of the story. </p> <p>An engaging, articulate, self-deprecating man in his thirties, he decided to become the guinea pig in an experiment as dangerous as the crazy stunts in the TV series Jackass, and as artistically motivated as Robert De Niro and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger putting on weight to lend authenticity to roles. </p> <p>He set out to live for a month by eating three meals a day bought at McDonald's, which has 30,000 branches in more than 100 countries; there's even one in a New York hospital: 'At least you're closer when the coronary kicks in,' he observes. A battery of doctors and nutritionists examines him before he sets out, then monitor his progress. </p> <p>Things don't go well as he edges towards joining the 50 per cent of Americans who are clinically obese, and risks becoming one of the 400,000 who die each year of obesity-related illnesses. On the third day, he's throwing up through his car window after downing a Big Mac and a super-size bag of fries. Within a week, his girlfriend, a vegan chef, tells us: 'I think the saturation fats are impeding the blood flow to his penis.' </p> <p>Between these reports on a regimen that takes his weight from 185.5 pounds to 210 and causes unexpected liver trouble (his GP recommends ending the experiment), Shurlock travels around America.

  "<p>'I think that pink is in my DNA', exclaims designer Karim Rashid. 'When I was a teenager, I was really into it.' For his Toronto high-school prom, he designed a suit for himself and had it made up in pink satin. He then dyed his hair and painted his nails to match. 'Things were more flamboyant back then, much more experimental,' he says. 'It was almost a cool thing to do.' Dress codes may have changed since, but Rashid is still into vibrant hues. 'What I love about colours that are between orange and pink is the high energy. They make you feel like you're alive.'</p> <p>In the living area of his New York loft, a kind of sprawling orange blob acts as a sofa. There are several curvaceous powder-pink chairs and ottomans and one wall is adorned with a flash of bright pink wallpaper called Replicant - part of a collection Rashid designed for Wolf-Gordon.</p> <p>Rashid has lived in the flat for five years now. He acquired half of the building in 1997 during a housing boom in New York. </p> <p>'The rents were going out of control, so I decided that I had to buy something,' he recalls. What he came across was a 'kind of fallow factory building' in the Chelsea district, built in 1898.</p> <p>'I was looking for such a raw space that I could really start from scratch,' says Rashid. This one was perfect. The ground floor had been a horse stable. The first floor had been used for 20 years as a plumbing supply storage. There was no water, no heating and no electrics. There were, however, rats everywhere, one-metre holes in the floors and hooks that had formerly been used for feeding the horses.</p> <p>On the ground floor, he installed his office. Since setting up his company in 1993, he has designed well over 800 products. They include his iconic Garbo trash can (more than 2m have been sold), interlocking perfume bottles for Issey Miyake, Prada's single-dose skincare line and even special-edition manhole covers for the streets of Manhattan. He has recently completed the Semiramis Hotel in Athens. Next up will be a 96-room hostelry called My Bright in Brighton. Rashid promises that it will be 'very soft and digital'. There won't be a sharp corner in sight and 'you'll be able to open your door by waving your card at it'.</p> <p>Rashid may need a key to get into the flat above the office, which he shares with his digital painter wife Megan Lang, yet it does have other advantages. It is, for instance, like almost every other space Rashid has lived in. 'They have all been long and narrow,' he says. Many years ago, he had a loft in Toronto that was just four metres wide and 24 metres deep. 'It had no windows, just skylights,' he remembers.</p> <p>Light also proved a problem in his Chelsea apartment. Originally, there were just four small windows at the front. He replaced them with floor-to-ceiling openings and also punched a huge window into the side wall. He then treated the space as one volume and hid all the utilities in a 'box', which runs down one side of the flat. In there, you can find the washer-dryer, the heater, a closet and the second bathroom. He also tested out a super-light concrete for the floors. 'It was a disaster. It just didn't level. It all undulated. In the sitting room, it goes up and down like lava.'</p> <p>Curvaceous lines are present throughout. Both the kitchen cabinets and the bathroom floor bear Rashid's trademark Morphscape pattern. Most of the furniture has rounded corners. One exception is the dining table which he made out of glass backed with a silver film for Zeritalia. 'I wouldn't do it like that now,' he says. 'It's hard today to live in the linear world of Descartes. It's a more organic world, which is not to say that we should live in some kind of bubble. </p> <p>It's just that we don't really need square edges on tables.' He learnt this lesson the hard way recently while staying at the Philippe Starck-designed Clift Hotel in San Francisco. He got up at 4am and broke his toe on the edge of a coffee table.</p> <p>One word that is central to his design philosophy is evolution. In 2001, he published his first book and called it Karim Rashid: I Want to Change the World. 'I don't want to live in a regressive environment. </p> <p>I don't have any ambition to be associated with the past at all.' The oldest thing in his flat is a Rosenthal vase from 1951. He also has two vintage Bang &amp; Olufsen stereos from 1968 and 1978. 'The latter is from my teenage years,' he says. </p> <p>'I remember saving all my money to buy it. My mother thought I was out of my mind.' He also has a few Memphis pieces - ceramics by Matteo Thun, a Michele De Lucchi bedside table and Ettore Sottsass's iconic penis vase (Rashid trained with the maestro during his graduate studies in Italy).</p> <p>Otherwise, practically everything else in the flat is of his own design. As he once said, 'I've surrounded myself with my own creations in a rather egocentric way.' He uses the front part of the flat for testing out his new prototypes. He brings one up for a week or so and then replaces it with another. 'Kids love the flat more than adults,' he remarks. 'I don't want to use the term \"playful\", but there is a happy spirit about the place.'</p>",
  "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP has emerged as clear favourite to buy Grey Global, the US advertising group being auctioned off by its majority shareholder, after tabling a $900-a-share offer that values the group at $1.25 billion. </p> <p>An announcement that WPP has bought the group could be made as early as tomorrow. The deadline for final bids passed last week and the Grey board met yesterday to consider offers from WPP, its French rival Havas and American venture capital firm Hellman &amp; Friedman. Friedman has tabled a joint bid with a financial partner, thought to be Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. </p> <p>Sources close to the negotiations say that WPP's cash and shares offer is the most likely to succeed because it can also afford to raise its offer if necessary, whereas the rival bidders may struggle to improve their bids. Havas is saddled with debts and has struggled to raise enough cash to join the auction in the face of opposition from some of its shareholders. Friedman and KKR cannot squeeze synergies out of the deal and that may prevent them from increasing their offers. </p> <p>Sorrell believes he can make the acquisition pay by raising Grey's margins and reducing its tax bill, but the key attraction is Grey's blue-chip client list, which includes Procter &amp; Gamble, BAT, Diageo and Nokia. </p> <p>Grey is the world's seventh largest advertising company and the last sizeable group to retain its independence.</p>",
  "<p> <strong> Memoirs of a Gnostic Dwarf <br> by David Madsen</strong> <br> Dedalus \u00a38.99, pp336 </p> <p> First published in 1995, it has taken years for this historical novel to gain the recognition it deserves. Set in the 16th century, it is narrated by a dwarf who has risen from humble beginnings to become Pope Leo X's most intimate confidant - but is secretly a gnostic. The narrative is propelled by an original imaginative energy and a beguiling, though sometimes, wearying mix of bawdiness and erudition: circus freaks, heretics and hunchbacks leap off pages that are also peppered with fragments of gnostic liturgies. Madsen warns us that his tale is 'somewhat salacious', and Leo's sexual and political proclivities are a far cry from his more familiar image as cultivated patron of Michelangelo. If you think Madsen can't get any more outrageous, try his second novel, The Confessions of a Flesh-Eater (1997), the tale of a gourmet's cannibalism</p> <p> <strong> The Fountain at the Centre of the World <br> by Robert Newman</strong> <br> Verso \u00a37.99, pp342 </p> <p> Chano Salgado wonders if the fountain in his local cafe might be responding minutely to everything going on everywhere in the world. The plot of this ambitious anti-globalisation novel shows how the global shudders through the minutiae of individual lives. Chano, a Mexican political dissident, is on the run after being persuaded to blow up a corporation's life-sapping pipelines. His wife has been shot by militia for attending a political meeting, and his long-lost brother, a PR executive for the corporations responsible for Chano's oppression, is dying of a beetle-borne disease and travelling to Mexico in search of a bone-marrow match. Although his characters sometimes spout too many sermons and despite some rather laboured symbolism, Robert Newman's third novel is as funny as it is serious, as it travels from London to Seattle's WTO street demonstrations. At the fringes of society, Newman gathers these scattered people together with considerable skill and poignancy. </p> <p> <strong> Dead Girls <br> by Nancy Lee</strong> <br> Faber \u00a37.99, pp306 </p> <p> Nightmarish television news crackles through the eight stories in Canadian author Nancy Lee's debut collection, telling of the dead prostitutes whose bones are unearthed in the backyard of a retired dentist in Vancouver. In the title story, the news besieges a woman who hasn't heard from her missing daughter for more than a year and who is broken with anxiety. With subtlety, sensuousness and surprising humour, Lee's fragmentary tales of women regarded as expendable explore emotional dislocation and the confused contours between living and dead in a haunting second-person singular - 'Your own skin seems to blur into the air around you, wash into the sheets.' They tell of relationships destroyed by too much intimacy, troubled by too much human touch: 'You worry about the dense scrub of relationship, an overgrowth of tenderness.' Lee keeps control of a high-pitched pain as she shows the disturbing speed at which affection can edge into brutality. </p>",
  "<p><strong>What's the Matter with America? The Resistible Rise of the American Right</strong><br>by Thomas Frank<br>Secker &amp; Warburg \u00a312, pp296</p> <p>For years, Thomas Frank and his Chicago-based political magazine, the Baffler, have been mere cult phenomena in Britain. While Michael Moore and other buffoons from the American 'left' have achieved global celebrity by producing a sort of Fox News for liberals, Frank's work has remained all but unknown.</p> <p>The reasons for his obscurity are a mystery. It can't be his writing, which is so dazzlingly witty and scornful it can stand comparison with the works of Twain or Mencken. Nor can anyone doubt his political commitment. Perhaps Frank is too honest a journalist to preach to the converted and feed their prejudices. It's hard to imagine a David Hare or Andrew Motion being entirely comfortable at the end of one of his books. They would find much they liked, but they would be disturbed by hard questioning of their own assumptions. The depressing truth is that there isn't much of a market for questioning of any kind.</p> <p>Frank was brought up in Leawood and Mission Hill, upper-class suburbs of Kansas City, when the left-wing populist tradition of the Midwest was a living memory. There were still people who knew that Kansas radicals had begun the American Civil War by joining the battle against slavery before hostilities officially broke out, and had gone on to scare the American ruling class by demanding unions, the regulation of banks and big business and help for small farmers.</p> <p>Today, there would appear to be plenty for American populists to be furious about. The small towns of the Midwest are being wiped out by Wal-Mart. Small farmers have been wiped out by agri-business. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer as the typical chief executive's salary rises to 400 times the pay of the average worker.</p> <p>True, there is a raging populist upsurge, a genuine working-class movement led by self-sacrificing militants who dedicate their lives to the cause. But it is a revolt which is unambiguously on the side of the fat cats. The homes of Leawood and Mission Hill, which Frank's modestly wealthy parents could afford 30 years ago, are now enclaves for the super-rich. Servants scurry hither and thither as private jets fly above lush lawns and pools.</p> <p>The victims of this unequal society gaze at the luxury which neither they nor their children will ever enjoy and resolve to vote for George W Bush.</p> <p>Or as Frank puts it: 'The angry workers, mighty in their numbers, are marching irresistibly against the arrogant. They are shaking their fists at the sons of privilege. They are laughing at the dainty affectations of the Leawood toffs. They are massing at the gates of Mission Hill, hoisting the black flag, and while the millionaires tremble in their mansions, they are bellowing out their terrifying demands, \"We are here,\" they scream, \"to cut your taxes.\"'</p> <p>Frank is in a different league from Michael Moore. He is a smarter and better writer, and a proper hack who has been to ask the supporters of the backlash why they vote against their fundamental interests.</p> <p>The answers, says Frank, lie first in the disastrous consequences of the liberal reliance on the judiciary and bills of rights to bring social change rather than votes in legislatures. Unelected judges legalised abortion in America and conservatives are able to claim that the common people have had their views disregarded by the elite. Indeed, they have convinced millions that this 'elite' is not made up of the actual holders of power, nearly all of them Republicans, but rich Hollywood stars who lecture the poor on how to behave, and TV executives and academics who pump out propaganda for homosexuality, pornography, divorce and promiscuity, and denigrate patriotism, sexual fidelity and godliness. Dismissing working-class concerns as the idiocies of stupid white men explains the failure of the US left.</p> <p>Frank ends by warning his American readers that 'things which begin in Kansas - the Civil War, prohibition, populism, Pizza Hut - have a historic tendency to go national'. The question for British readers is whether they could go international.</p> <p>This can't be ruled out. In the US, the Republicans adopted the language of class struggle the moment the left abandoned it. There are striking similarities with Britain. Like the US Democrats, New Labour has taken classic questions about the distribution of wealth and regulation of the mighty out of political debate. The existing economic order is beyond question: it's just there as if it were the will of God.</p> <p>The government has, in fact, done a great deal to help the disadvantaged, far more than the Clinton administration did. But ministers don't give tax credits and Sure Start to the working class loudly and proudly as a reward for their honest toil. Benefits are slipped out of the back pocket in the embarrassed manner of a man throwing coins to a beggar.</p> <p>The lesson is that class politics don't die just because the political class decides that economics is no longer a fit subject for the electorate. Deny ordinary people the chance to fight wars about resources and they will fight culture wars instead, and when the left fights on its enemy's terrain, the right is laughing all the way to the bank.</p>",
  "<p>Opec, the oil producers' cartel, is poised to raise its target price range for a barrel of crude this week - delivering a harsh message to oil-guzzling economies to get used to a $30 floor under prices. </p> <p>Ministers from Opec's member nations meet in Vienna on Thursday, and will discuss the future of the $22 to $28 target band, which has been breached continuously since December last year. </p> <p>Several countries, including Venezuela, which is already pumping at capacity, have signalled that they believe the target is now unrealistic. Purnomo Yusgiantoro, Opec's president, said last week: 'The price range we have today of $22 to $28 a barrel was decided back in 2000. There has to be a different price range today.' </p> <p>Prices have been boosted in recent weeks by concerns about the security of supplies from the embattled Russian firm Yukos, and the slower-than-expected restoration of oil exports from Iraq. </p> <p>But analysts say the basic problem is the fastest growth in demand for a generation, coupled with long-term underinvestment in oil infrastructure. </p> <p>Raising the band would send a warning to consumers and companies that they should accept $30 a barrel as the norm, and give Opec a more realistic target. </p> <p>'It would be symbolic. It would be a signal that Opec thinks something has changed in the oil market,' says Kevin Norrish, commodity market analyst at Barclays Capital. 'Otherwise, the target just becomes completely irrelevant.' </p> <p>He believes that the current price rise also reflects an underestimate of how quickly production from mature fields, including in the North Sea, would decline. Britain recorded a trade deficit in oil in July for the first time in 13 years. </p> <p>But explicitly targeting a higher price would risk the fury of politicians keen to see energy costs brought under control. Chancellor Gordon Brown said on Friday he had asked Opec to 'signal the action needed to bring prices to a level consistent with sustained world growth'. </p> <p>Economists have become concerned about the health of the global economy since oil prices took off in the summer. Opec pledged to stabilise the market, but have already ramped up production by 1.5 million barrels per day to 29.3m in the last four months with little impact on prices. </p> <p>Thursday's meeting is likely to result in another small rise in production quotas, but since Opec members are are already breaking their official targets, and have little spare capacity, analysts say it will be little more than an acceptance of reality.</p> <p><strong>BP chemical sale</strong></p> <p>BP IS set to make \u00a32.3bn from the sale of around half of its petrochemicals division.

  "<p>H Lee Scott is the most important man you have never heard of. That won't be true for much longer. Scott's long valued anonymity is disappearing rapidly. Last week Vanity Fair crowned him king of its annual New Establishment power list. From his giddy perch at number one, the folksy president of Wal-Mart looked down on rivals such as Rupert Murdoch, Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg. The media moguls of our information age had just been rudely humbled by the Midwestern boss of a 'pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap' supermarket chain. </p> <p>The result shocked many. But it shouldn't have. The fact is that Scott is one of the most powerful men stalking the corridors of mega-business. Scott's Wal-Mart is redefining what a big company really means. Its tentacles stretch from its headquarters in rural Arkansas across the world. </p> <p>Just a few facts and figures fill out the picture. Wal-Mart is the biggest company on earth. Its sales last year of $256 billion were more than the GDP of Poland. If it were a country, it would be ranked 19th in wealth in the world. With a staff of 1.5 million it has more men and women in uniform than the US army. Compared to that, Microsoft and News International are bit players in the game of capitalism. </p> <p>It is not just about size either. It is also about style. Wal-Mart has revolutionised business in America. Wal-Mart drives down costs so it can offer the lowest prices. It fights the unions, pays un-princely wages and - critics say - big-foots the communities it arrives in. When Wal-Mart enters a town, it causes many other businesses to close. They just cannot compete. </p> <p>And it all happens on an enormous scale. Wal-Mart has become the ultimate symbol of the corporate sameness that seems to have turned all of Main Street America into one long strip of soulless brand names. Wal-Mart is also firmly entrenched in Britain. After buying Asda in 1999, the company has steadily moved up the ladder. </p> <p>Asda has now overtaken Sainsbury's to become Britain's number two supermarket behind Tesco. Many in the City now believe Scott is eyeing fresh British acquisitions. Certainly that might explain why Scott mysteriously granted a rare interview to the Today programme on 2 September. He used it to defend himself against his company's many critics. </p> <p>'It looks like the start of a British hearts-and-minds campaign,' wrote one City commentator afterwards. Britain beware. The world does not wait to go to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart comes to the world. </p> <p>H Lee Scott was born in Joplin, Missouri, in 1949, but his father, Harold Scott, soon moved the family to the town of Baxter Springs, Kansas. Perhaps fittingly Baxter Springs was named after the first store owner in the area, because Scott is now the biggest shopkeeper in the world. </p> <p>The elder Scott was a garage owner in the tiny settlement that still proudly proclaims itself 'The First Cowtown in Kansas'. Scott, and his two brothers, went to the local high school. </p> <p>Scott was both sporty and academic. He played American football and competed in athletics, played in the school band and sang in the choir. He was a success, but not a star. Like many Midwesterners, Scott went to a local college, Pittsburgh State University in south-east Kansas, where he graduated in 1971 with a degree in business administration. </p> <p>So far, so typical of a Midwestern youth. There is still much small town America in both Wal-Mart and Scott. At Wal-Mart store 'greeters' welcome shoppers with a smile and a hello. Wal-Mart workers are known as associates, not employees. Each day begins with the staff doing the 'Wal-Mart cheer' which closes with the chant: 'Who's number one? The customer! Always!' </p> <p>Scott has retained much of that disarming friendliness. His accent is still Midwestern and his speech is peppered with folksy turns of phrase. His hobbies are stubbornly low-key (he is a keen fisherman, for instance) and he drives a VW Beetle. He is boyish and polite and has been compared to a JR Ewing-like figure in his appearance and down-home charm. That's a Wal-Mart tradition. The chain's founder, Sam Walton, turned a nickel-and-dime store in the Arkansas town of Bentonville into a global superpower. But at the same time Walton always drove a pick-up truck. Wal-Mart is still based in Bentonville and Scott now sits in the same tiny ground floor office that 'Mr Sam' used. </p> <p>Wal-Mart is a giant presence in the economic landscape of America and the world. It is telling that there is no direct flight from New York to the Arkansas capital of Little Rock. But there are two flights a day to Bentonville (pop. 25,000). In an area called 'Vendorville' around Wal-Mart's headquarters more than 200 companies - who sell their goods on Wal-Mart shelves - maintain 'embassies' in order to keep close to Scott's Wal-Mart court. </p> <p>The key to Wal-Mart's success, and Scott's, is simple: a ruthless business sense. Scott learned the value of hard work and money early on. He met his wife at college and they quickly had a son, Eric. As the young couple struggled to make ends meet, they lived in a rented trailer home at the Lone Star Trailer Court in Pittsburgh. Scott worked in the evenings at a local tyre factory for just two dollars an hour. Then he would come home and study after midnight. </p> <p>'I worked at McNally's from about 3:30pm to midnight, and studied between midnight and 2am,' Scott once said. 'At the time, it didn't seem difficult, it just seemed cold because the heater in the trailer didn't work.' </p> <p>Those hard times taught Scott the value of money. He never forgot it. After an inauspicious start to his business career (he was turned down from a job at a freight company and a friend later had to ring the firm and convince them to reconsider), Scott became a salesmen. Seven years later he joined Wal-Mart after initially contacting the firm to negotiate over a debt of $7,000. He had a flair for organisation and 'stripping out the costs', which was the key Wal-Mart innovation to making profits. </p> <p>Of course 'costs' in business-speak often means 'jobs' to the people sacked in order to economise. Scott rarely let emotion get in the way. 'One truck driver I fired five times and Sam [Walton] hired him back four times,' Scott once joked. The punch line was clear: the driver still ended up fired. Scott's rise up the ranks was rapid. His hard work, genius for logistics and charm propelled him into the company's top tier. In 2000 he was appointed president. </p> <p>But he has inherited a firm that has made many enemies. Wal-Mart is strongly anti-union. Shop managers are told to report to Bentonville at the first sign of union activity (which includes workers being spotted talking together in huddles). A team from Bentonville is then dispatched to 'deal with the problem'. Wal-Mart's wages are also low and its healthcare plans are beyond the reach of most of its workers. It has often shown a market-chutzpah that many other companies would blush at. For years it ran a 'We Buy American' advertising campaign while importing huge amounts of goods from the developing world. A year after Scott took over Wal-Mart moved its global purchasing headquarters to China. It is now the largest importer of Chinese-made products in the world. </p> <p>Across America groups have sprung up to protest about Wal-Marts opening in their cities. Recently residents of the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood voted against letting Wal-Mart open in their community. Scott shrugged off the defeat. 'I don't think we'll win every election. And I don't give a diddly if we don't,' he laughed, speaking to a group of Arkansas businessmen. He's right. Sometimes Wal-Mart loses, but more often it wins. And there is always another target in the horizon in America, or in Britain or the Far East. Over the next few years it plans around 800 new stores in the US alone. </p> <p>Wal-Mart's and Scott's relentless rise also seems to reflect a deeper power shift in America. Wal-Mart stores, like Scott himself, are firmly based in the traditions of the South and Midwest. They represent a rejection of the traditional American elites on the west and east coasts. Two-thirds of Wal-Marts are in 'Red States' that voted for President George W Bush in 2000. The fact that Wal-Mart stays in Bentonville, rather than relocate to New York, speaks volumes of where power is now located in America. </p> <p>The description of Scott as a charmer whose ruthless streak is hidden by a folksy style also describes the current inhabitant of the White House. That suits Scott. Wal-Mart donates large amounts of cash to the Republicans. When the Vice President, Dick Cheney, gave his first talk to a company workforce he came to Bentonville. When you are as big as Wal-Mart, when you are as powerful as Scott, the world's elite comes to your door. One thing is now clear: Scott's place at the top of Vanity Fair 's power list was no accident. The only surprise is that no one noticed him before. </p> <p><strong> H Lee Scott Jnr</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 14 March 1949 (Joplin, Missouri) </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> President and chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Baxter Springs high school; Pittsburgh State University, Kansas </p> <p><strong> Family:</strong> Married to Linda Gale Aldridge (two sons)</p>",
  "<p>Why square blocks wouldn't fit in round holes and why I could never manage to colour inside the black lines were just some of the many conundrums that puzzled me when I was at primary school.

What confused me even more was that, when I innocently put this question to my teacher, he said I was a troublemaker, just like my mother. </p> <p>'Racism, it seems, is going out of fashion,' wrote Tony Sewell, director of the Hackney Learning Trust, earlier this year. He argued that black people needed to snap out of their 'culture of victimhood' and stop perceiving racism as a bar to black advancement. </p> <p>But when I read the report published last week by the London Development Agency's Education Commission, highlighting the way the education system had failed black pupils, I found little evidence to support Sewell's view. The report focused on the discrimination faced by black boys in inner-city schools. However, from my experience, even when money, a stable background and encouraging parents are in place, black children still suffer as a result of low teacher expectations and negative stereotyping. </p> <p>It wasn't exactly racism. No one called me 'nigger'. But I can't remember anything we did about black history. The only black people we came across were in English Literature and they were slaves. No one taught me about Marcus Garvey. No one said 'you'll do great things'. </p> <p>I don't come from a disadvantaged background. Nor do I fit any of the other stereotypes that commentators cite as the reasons for black children underperforming. I was privately educated from three to 10 and my secondary education was at a grammar school that regularly tops the league tables. The school, in a leafy Home Counties suburb, was far from underfunded yet, six years after leaving school, my experience leads me to conclude that I have achieved what I have in spite, not because, of my education. </p> <p>My parents were keen to take an active role in my education. But in the Eighties mentioning phrases such as 'positive racial identity' and the 'self-confidence of black children' was not welcomed by the staff at my primary school. </p> <p>My mother soon earned a reputation as being 'difficult'. Talking with my parents now, we laugh about my early experiences. When it came to school plays, Nativity or otherwise, black children were either donkeys or devils. When my sister, who went to the school four years later, got to play a wise man in the Christmas play, it was considered ground-breaking by black parents at the school. </p> <p>At secondary school I remember being made to stand in front of my English Literature class while an irate teacher shouted: 'Who do you think you are? You'll never amount to anything!' Those were pretty harsh words for a 13-year-old whose only crime was to forget her dictionary. I loathed school. Admittedly I wasn't the ideal student. I didn't always hand in my homework on time and wasn't always interested in what was going on in lessons but, even when I tried, it seemed to me as if I achieved little support. </p> <p>At 13, I was preparing to sit exams that would be used to decide which set I would be in for my GCSEs. I was predicted a very low grade for maths. My father, a former maths lecturer, was convinced that I could do much better and subjected me to hours of extra tuition after school. </p> <p>While all my white friends were living it up at the local under-18s disco, I was stuck at home having my cranium stuffed full of algebra, statistics and trigonometry. No matter how much I cried or protested, my father always made me spend at least an hour with him as soon as he got home from work. When I received my results, my maths teacher told me I had got the highest mark possible. Yet she looked at me as if I had cheated. </p> <p>When I was 14, my headmistress recommended to my parents that I repeat the year. Since primary school, I had been a year ahead, but my teachers at my secondary school seemed to think this was a mistake. They believed I wouldn't achieve five GCSE passes. The option of encouraging me to work harder or giving me extra help was never offered. Instead that role fell to my parents, who were adamant that I was more than capable of passing my exams without repeating the year. </p> <p>With extra tuition from my father and family friends who were teachers, I achieved 10 GCSE passes all grade A* to C. While I was pleased to have done well, what gave me the greatest satisfaction was proving my teachers wrong. </p> <p>Last week I contacted my headmistress for her views on how a mainly white grammar school approaches the issue of race. I remembered her as a small South African, who took great pride in maintaining the reputation of her school. Her no-nonsense approach used to put the fear of God into me. I had recently started to think of myself as an adult, but when I heard her voice for the first time in six years I felt slightly ill, like a small child with nerves. </p> <p>Initially she suggested that maybe I had approached the wrong school. 'We don't have many black girls here,' she said. I told her that I had not forgotten. Of more than 1,000 pupils during my time, no more than 12 were black. She questioned what I meant by 'black'. 'I hate labels,' she said, adding that she saw no point in political correctness. 'As you will know, Zoe, politics, race and religion have no bearing on the way we treat our girls,' she said. </p> <p>I disagreed with her, and I suggested that it might have been useful to have strategies in place for dealing with children from different backgrounds. She insisted that the school celebrated the diversity of all its pupils' backgrounds. </p> <p>That sounded markedly different from my experience. I told her that I didn't remember any instances of Afro-Caribbean culture being celebrated, let alone mentioned. 'Well, there were only three of you in your year,' she said. </p> <p>But is this a valid excuse? Research into mainly white schools published by the Department for Education in 2002 found that diversity within the minority ethnic population must be recognised and respected. 'One size fits all' approaches create additional problems for minority ethnic pupils and their parents. </p> <p>The general lesson I learnt from my school years was that people's expectation of me were going to be zero and that I would have to prove myself and dispel their stereotyped views. I don't resent that, but I still feel almost as if I'm required to over-achieve so that my race is never a barrier to me. Without the encouragement of my parents and their positive example of success, I don't think I would have bothered to sit my A levels or go to university. </p> <p>All my anecdotal evidence shows that parents who take an active interest in their children's education do much better. 'We need to educate a significant number of black parents, not just children,' says my father. 'Parents who think that it is the schools' responsibility to educate their children find that their children do not perform as well as if they worked alongside the school taking an active interest in their child's education.' </p> <p>Race is a problem in education as much as it is in any other part of life. Unfortunately, because school is an environment where children are subjected to the power of adults, the impact of any prejudice is much more intense. </p> <p>But if black parents want their children's performance to improve, they must take an active interest in their children's education. Greater parental involvement is the only way that the trend can be reduced. The more you invest in a child, the greater the returns. </p> <p><strong>Hard lessons</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> September 1996: School inspectorate Ofsted found that black boys were locked into a cycle of failure, while being four times more likely to be excluded from school. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> March 1999: A second Ofsted survey found that African-Caribbeans were often the lowest-performing group in GCSE exams. It blamed low expectations and prejudice among teachers for their poor achievement. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> August 2000: Tony Sewell, a black academic from Leeds University, provoked a storm of criticism from within the black community for suggesting that black youth culture was to blame for low educational attainment among African-Caribbean boys. He was accused of blaming the victim. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> October 2003: Controversial black left-wing MP Diane Abbott sparked claims of hypocrisy when she announced she was sending her son to a private secondary school. She described her own decision as 'indefensible'. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> September 2004: A report commissioned by the London Development Agency found that the English system is seen by the black community to have failed its children for 50 years. School data from 2000-02 showed African-Caribbean boys were consistently the lowest performing ethnic group group in primary and secondary school.</p>",
  "President George W. Bush will face vitriolic attacks on his character this week, especially his National Guard service during the Vietnam War. <p>Democrat-linked groups are finally getting tough after the challenger, John Kerry, suffered brutal character assassinations by the Republicans. </p> <p>Documents and allegations have surfaced painting a picture of a rich, pampered young man who avoided going to Vietnam after family connections secured him a coveted place in a 'champagne unit' of the National Guard. Once there Bush failed to adequately complete his service, shirked his duties and was released early without punishment. </p> <p>At the same time controversial biographer Kitty Kelley will be promoting her book on his family. It includes allegations about the young Bush's cocaine use and a claim he once pressured a girlfriend to have an abortion. Kelley's allegations have been dismissed as gutter gossip by Republicans but Democrats hope mud will stick. </p> <p>Mainstream attention is now focused on whether Bush reported for National Guard duty in Alabama in 1972 when he moved there to work on a Republican campaign. This week TV adverts will air featuring Bob Mintz, a retired veteran who says he never saw Bush in his unit of 700 people. 'You just can't go and come in a unit as small as that without being noticed by someone,' Mintz said. </p> <p>Only one person says he saw Bush do National Service but that account, by Bill Calhoun, who says he saw Bush on base on several dates, conflicts with records showing Bush was paid for duty on different dates. </p> <p>The 400 pages of documents released by the White House in February had seemed to dampen a media firestorm on Bush's record. But independent researchers combed through them and a different picture emerged - Bush went unpunished for breaking regulations, was grounded after missing a medical, and he failed to contact a Guard unit when he went to Harvard Business School as he was obligated to. </p> <p>Ben Barnes, a former Texas politician, has claimed he used his clout to secure Bush a safe place in the Texas Air National Guard in a shady backroom deal common at a time when the rich did not want their children in Vietnam. </p> <p>But worse is to come as signs emerge of a Democrat attack machine warming up with all the hallmarks of the Republican dirty tricks department that so successfully smeared Kerry. Barnes is directly linked to Kerry's campaign. The Mintz adverts are run by Texans For Truth, headed by Glenn Smith, who says the Republicans' criticism of Kerry's Vietnam record opened the door. 'They started this,' Smith said. 'It is only fair to scrutinise the President.' </p> <p>For Democrats, the attacks on Bush may mark a change in policy but so far it has had little impact on the polls - Bush leads Kerry 50 per cent to 44 per cent.</p>",
  "<p>The news that Tony Blair will this week reinforce Britain's commitment to the fight global warming is timely. The omens of climate change have never been so striking or alarming. After a British summer of rain and ruined harvests, and of disappearing polar ice-caps and rising sea levels, we now have the sight of hurricane Ivan maintaining its deadly path across the Caribbean, the third to have battered the region this summer. </p> <p>Of course, climatologists are - rightly - cautious about linking this profusion of storms with manmade activities. Other explanations, involving decades-long cycles in ocean current behaviour, can still account for their appearance and for the billions of dollars of damage hurricanes have inflicted. </p> <p>But it would be a distinctly unimaginative individual who could look at Ivan's handiwork and fail to note humanity's frailty when faced with the fury of the elements. For all our sophisticated meteorology and communications, satellites and radar, our ability to organise emergency airlifts and evacuations, we remain vulnerable when battling against Nature at its angriest. </p> <p>As the distinguished Harvard scientist EO Wilson has noted: 'More frequent heat waves, violent storms, forest fires, droughts, and flooding will be the spawn of our historically unprecedented pace of climate change.' Gainsayers may deny mankind's role in global warming, but scientists who have been monitoring the atmosphere for the past 15 years are convinced our indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels, in cars and factories, has raised atmospheric temperatures by one degree Celsius over the past century. A further four or five over the next 50 years is also forecast, and is expected to unleash weather of undreamt-of ferocity. </p> <p>Can we rectify our behaviour, cut our industrial emissions and make greater reliance on renewable sources of energy in order to save our world? Mr Blair will no doubt claim we can. More cynical commentators may disagree, for the power to halt climate change lies outside our direct control. Until America - responsible for almost a quarter of the planet's total carbon dioxide emissions - commits itself to the cause, hopes of stopping our world overheating will be doomed to failure. </p> <p>The Prime Minister has been pressed several times by his cabinet colleagues to underline his climatological differences with the White House and to show that he is capable of standing up to the Republican right on issues of principle. Until he does, there is no prospect of America understanding its isolation on this issue, and therefore no prospect of our planet saving itself.</p>",
  "Gay christians are accusing homosexual bishops in the Anglican communion of caving in to a conservative agenda and plunging the church into further crisis. <p>They are outraged that a number of bishops known to be gay but not 'out' in public have refused to speak up for homosexual rights in the church while the Eames Commission looked at the issue, which could split the church. </p> <p>The commission was set up after election of the openly gay Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire in the US last year and its findings, completed last week, will point to the future for the 70 million-strong Anglican communion. </p> <p>'When Gene was consecrated we expected other gay American bishops to put their heads above the parapet. This has not proved to be the case,' said Martin Reynolds, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. 'We're dismayed Gene has been left to stand alone.' </p> <p>He warned that the bishops' failure to act would hurt the church by forcing gay clergy to keep their sexuality hidden. 'Secrecy is the church's worst enemy. The present crisis stems from forcing people to keep quiet or tell lies.' </p> <p>Yesterday Robinson warned the furore was distracting the Anglican Church from speaking out on issues such as Sudan and Aids: 'How self-absorbed can we be, to be fighting over this when people are dying everywhere?' </p> <p>The final draft of the commission's report, completed after months of investigation by Archbishop Eames, Primate of the Church of Ireland, has been handed to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. </p> <p>The commission is expected to recommend censuring the Ecclesiastical Church of the USA (Ecusa), which backed Robinson's appointment, and the diocese of New Westminster in Canada, which has approved same-sex blessings. </p> <p>Possible action could involve breaking links with Canterbury for a number of years, so they can 'repent'. They could be barred from the Lambeth Conference in 2008, when important matters governing the future of the communion are discussed. </p> <p>Williams, spiritual head of the Anglican communion, is expected to appoint alternative bishops to offer an episcopal overview for US and Canadian parishes seeking to stay linked to Canterbury. </p> <p>A failure to censure the two bodies would prompt many African dioceses - known as 'the Global South'- to break their links with Canterbury, and take more than half of the communion's 70 million members with them. </p> <p>The Rev David Hillborn, head of theology at the Evangelical Alliance, which is opposed to the appointment of openly gay bishops, warned: 'I suspect that some kind of measure with teeth will be necessary for the communion to hold together.' </p> <p>But censure would be greeted with dismay by liberals in the church and would also threaten the financial viability of the communion. More than 30 per cent of its revenues comes from Ecusa. </p> <p>Some theologians believe such a move would breach the Anglican emphasis on diversity. 'There is no one moral issue about which Anglicans all agree, whether it's birth control or homosexuality. That is what being an Anglican amounts to', said Professor Andrew Linzey, Fellow of Blackfriars Hall, Oxford.</p>",
  "<p>There wasn't enough booing in Edinburgh last month. The city is supposed to test young talent, promote the avant-garde and fill the cultural veins of the world with fresh blood. Why is it just the critics who get to choose what lives and what dies? </p> <p>The comedians understand this, especially on the late-night open mike shows where the crowd are red-mist drunk and coliseum vicious. I recall one poor boy actually start apologising: 'I was up early and haven't had the chance to get on top of my material.' That was a mistake and he was quickly led from the stage in tears. </p> <p>We shouldn't feel bad, though. A thin skin is a great enemy of art, and I am sure that man is now a happy estate agent in Croydon, if not someone you'd want to sit next to at dinner. </p> <p>With the high arts, we are too polite. This is one of several distinct, and narrow, areas where we would benefit from being more Mediterranean. What is the point of people spending their time getting projects on to the page and then on to the stage if we are not to match their passion with our own? </p> <p>Certainly, we Celts aren't afraid of booing. Look at sporting events. It doesn't require a trip to Ibrox to hear some stout denunciations from the terraces. However, it's worth being careful, because I'm talking about performance, not the ugly tribalism that has some thug shouting that he 'wants to bathe' in another man's 'Fenian blood'. </p> <p>The booing I'm talking of is of the sort aimed at stout Chris Robinson, the CEO of Hearts. There can be no better expression of the fans' fury over the sale of their home ground, Tynecastle, than the chant: 'Who ate all the pies?' </p> <p>This can grow in importance, as when the New York Islanders ice hockey team journeyed to Montreal's Bell Centre to play the Montreal Canadiens last year. The New York fans were outraged when nearly 21,000 Canadiens' supporters booed the 'Star Spangled Banner'. This protest at the invasion of Iraq quickly led to tit-for-tat abuse of the respective national anthems at subsequent games. There were similar displays at the recent Olympics. </p> <p>Obviously for the sportsmen, this is deeply unfair, but then so is George Bush's use of the Iraqi football team's success as a prop in his re-election campaign. The squandering of global sympathy is important to November's US elections, and it can only be good that American voters hear cries from outside their borders. My guess is that more swing voters watch ice hockey games than read the editorial pages of the New York Times but, having said that, the Montreal fans' behaviour may have the opposite effect to what was intended. </p> <p>It's a bit of a leap from Bush's behaviour to my irritation at the Hanover State Opera's decision to set Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande in some white palace of an asylum. But then, you have to react to what is in front of you, and I am grumpy that the superb singers and orchestra were so ill-served. Booing is the captive audience's response to being ill-served - by those leading us or entertaining us. </p> <p>Perhaps that is why the Mediterraneans are more keen on expressing disgust - they are more used to being politically powerless. Or perhaps not. Booing started with paid claques taking out the opposition, and instilled itself in the culture. The great fear of those in the arts in Britain is that booing will only be used for reactionary purposes, that audiences will shout down anything that is new and interesting. </p> <p>Yet Edinburgh audiences are up for a bit of modernity. The problem with the Debussy was not the pure white walls that the originally wooded set had become, but the complete separation of the words from the action. There was no vision to offer us anything new. In Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, even the guns used in his Verona (beach) have Sword.45 written down their sides, neatly shifting Shakespeare's text into context. Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, M\u00e9lisande throws her ring into the sea, the performer staring at the hospital floor. We should have howled. </p> <p>Anyone engaged in a creative act will tell you what they most fear is a shrug of the shoulders. They will tell you passion, either in favour or against, is preferable. I don't know if I completely believe that. After all, I am asking for trouble here. I have never heard any booing at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, but I have been asked by an old lady why I was 'so boring'. My hurt was compounded when a friend cheered her on. </p> <p>This is what it's all about, though, if you set yourself up to entertain (and doubly so if you plan to lead). The moment I most enjoyed at the Book Festival occurred a few years ago, when I watched Will Self field a question about whether he had modelled for the cover picture of his novel, Great Apes. So, let's bring on the passion. Boo when booing's due and roar when roaring's called for. </p> <p>I'm going to treasure this Mediterranean dream, just as I sometimes pray for the day when Italian-style driving takes hold in the UK. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com\">ruaridhnicoll@hotmail.com</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ruaridh Nicoll's novel, Wide Eyed, is published in paperback by Black Swan, \u00a36.99</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners have condemned plans by the World Bank to relax its environmental and social requirements when lending money to the private sector.</p> <p>The proposed changes, which deal with controversial issues such as pollution and the mistreatment of indigenous people by Western companies, were condemned by Friends of the Earth last night.</p> <p>'They make a sham of the World Bank's declared mission to alleviate poverty,' a spokesperson said.</p> <p>The World Bank will unveil detailed proposals, which follow a lengthy review, on Thursday.

No changes will be adopted until the end of a consultation period next February.</p> <p>The Washington-based body lends to companies via its private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation.

  "Conservative reshuffles come and go, we shadow ministers move up, down or - as in my case last week - out, but the real problem for the Conservative party has been obstinately the same since 1997: how can we persuade more than 30 per cent of the electorate to vote for us? If we can't, we are doomed to permanent opposition under a first-past-the-post system, however enthusiastic that 30 per cent may be about us. Even at a time when Tony Blair and his government have been rightly falling in public esteem, those searching for a new political home have been spreading themselves everywhere else except the Conservative party. <p>The inexorable logic that 30 per cent means continuing lost elections leads me to disbelieve the widespread press comment that the leadership is engaged in a deliberate shift to the right, and a strategy of shoring up the core Conservative vote by planning to campaign more on Europe and asylum, the issues that set the pulses racing among Conservative activists but fail to do so among the wider population. Michael Howard is far too shrewd not to remember that we have tried this before, in the run-up to the 2001 election, and that proved a disaster that set the party's recovery back by many years. </p> <p>I am equally puzzled by reports that the Conservative party is so scared about the United Kingdom Independence party (Ukip) that it feels the need to appease its voters. Puzzled because there are two clear reasons why this would not work. First, if you start edging towards Ukip you may well pick up some extra support on one side, but you will shed support on the other - and the last time I looked the Liberal Democrats were rather better supported than Ukip. Secondly, there are indeed a small number of people who hold the honest view that this country should leave the EU. I believe they are wrong, and so does the Conservative party, and their view is so straightforward that there is no compromising with it, no fudging that would satisfy all sides. So appeasement of Ukip would do more harm than good. </p> <p>A successful strategy will start from the premise that voters know what is important in their lives, and that we need to show them Conservative solutions to the problems that face them. One of the peculiarities of the 2001 debacle was that evidence was laid before MPs and party professionals that the economy, crime, health and education were what people cared about, and that Europe and asylum featured last. Nevertheless, we chose the least important issues as the centre of our campaign. </p> <p>The best thing we have done in the past three years is to accept that public services are an absolutely key issue, and to devote time and effort to devising practical policies that will deal with current difficulties, while also fitting into a recognisably Tory view of the world. We need now to have the confidence to keep them high on our agenda. Tony Blair in opposition recognised that as long as the economy remained a 'Tory issue', which Labour could at best play down, Labour was going to lose. So he turned it into a genuine battleground. We need to do the same on the big so-called 'Labour issues'. </p> <p>Let's also learn from George Bush. Education was an issue the Republicans thought they could never capture. He made it the centrepiece of his compassionate conservatism, and look what happened. In 2000 he won when he was, in British terms, fighting an incumbent administration confident of a third term. That sounds rather a good scenario to me. We also need to remember how little time people devote to politics and to make the policies memorable. Take two of the issues I have helped develop. Abolishing university tuition fees and getting rid of unnecessary speed cameras are ideas that can be grasped instantly, and grab the attention of those for whom politics is a complete switch-off. We need to do more of this. </p> <p>Of course, we do not need to spend all our firepower on the public services. Crime, policing and the maintenance of orderly streets have always been heartland Tory concerns and hugely important to millions of people. The central nature of this issue illustrates why we need relentlessly to demonstrate that we are a moderate, pragmatic party and not a set of ideologues. The tough policies we need (and have) on crime and related issues will no doubt be dubbed 'extremist' by Labour. It is much easier to brush this away if it is apparent from everything we say and the way we say it that we are not remotely extreme. </p> <p>It is also a key part of the moderate Conservatism I have always believed in that tackling crime and disorder is one of the best ways to help the less fortunate. Those who can live in protected communities and travel in cars are less likely to meet everyday disorder and dirt than those living in flats on estates and using public transport. So there is no dichotomy between modern practical conservatism and traditional Conservative 'tough' messages on some issues. </p> <p>For years the 'modernisers' have been arguing that the Conservative party needs to look and sound different. This is correct, but it is not enough. The real challenge is to produce easily understood policies in the key areas which fit into a framework that itself applies Tory principles to 21st-century Britain. When we do that, and sell the policies relentlessly, we will break through the ceiling that we keep hitting in the polls, and will look forward to doing the real job of the Conservative party: running this country in the interests of all its people.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Damian Green is MP for Ashford, Kent</p>"
