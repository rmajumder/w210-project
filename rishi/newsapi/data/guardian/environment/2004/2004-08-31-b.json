  "<p><strong>KJ:</strong> What do you think it was about the script that excited people so much?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> It's a very exciting script to read. It had the same compelling urgency that the finished movie has. You read the first page of it, which is a character description of Travis Bickle, and you know you're on a ride.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Were many changes made between the draft you gave to your agent friend and the screen version?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> Very few. Marty wanted two things added: a scene for Albert Brooks and a scene for Harvey Keitel. I was opposed to this because everything in the movie should take place from the taxi driver's point of view, and if he doesn't see it, it doesn't exist. I said, \"You can't let the audience know that there's another world out there, otherwise, they won't buy into this, because his is a rather unsavoury one.\" And I turned out to be right, because in the end Marty did cut the scene that he shot for Albert; and for the scene he shot for Harvey, which is the one of him and Jodie dancing, he had to put in a shot of Bobby from another scene, looking up at a window, so that it looked as if he was watching them. I think the reason that the film works is that you're given no alternative world to Travis's.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Do you think that the film caught so many people's imaginations because of its strong sense of pent-up anger?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> Yes. Godard once said that all great movies are successful for the wrong reasons, and there were a lot of wrong reasons why Taxi Driver was successful. The sheer violence of it really brought out the Times Square crowd. But I have no real quarrel with that. I think that films can be extremely violent provided they understand the root causes of the violence. I think The Wild Bunch is a great film because it understands how deeply sick it is, and lets you know how sick it is; so it not only exploits your vicarious need for violence, but undermines it at the same time. I think films that analyse violence in that way are entirely justified.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> But the violence in Travis is not held up for analysis in a sociological or psychological way, is it? The film seems to have distinct spiritual ambitions.</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> Yes. Travis's is not a societally imposed loneliness or rage, it's an existential kind of rage. The book I reread just before sitting down to write the script was Sartre's Nausea, and if anything is the model for Taxi Driver, that would be it.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> And there are references to Bresson as well - the line about thinking he has stomach cancer...</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> And the scene where he makes the gun slide, which is sort of an allusion to Pickpocket. Originally Marty shot that scene so that it lasted 10 minutes or more, dwelling on the sensuous mechanics of the process. I think that what makes the film so vivid is what has made all my collaborations with Scorsese interesting, which is that we both have essentially the same moral background - a kind of closed-society Christian morality, though mine is rural and Protestant and his is urban and Catholic; mine is North European and his is South European. We can basically agree on everything in life, but we don't express it in the same way. I once described the film as the story of a Protestant kid from the snow country who wandered into a cathedral in the middle of New York City. That conflict of sensibilities is what makes it vibrate.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Presumably there was something about Travis's character that reflected an aspect of your own - the loneliness, the rage, the wish for a kind of purgation?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> At the time I wrote it I was very enamoured of guns, I was very suicidal, I was drinking heavily, I was obsessed with pornography in the way a lonely person is, and all those elements are upfront in the script. Obviously some aspects are heightened - the racism of the character, the sexism. Like every kind of underdog, Travis takes out his anger on the guy below him rather than the guy above. When they edited the film for TV I didn't so much mind having to lose the violence, but they had to remove huge sections of narration because of the virulent anti-black and anti-women characterisations. He appeared a very silly kind of guy because there was no edge to his anger; you just wanted to slap him in the face and say, \"Come on, come on.\" In fact, in the draft of the script that I sold, at the end all the people he kills are black. Marty and the Phillipses and everyone said, no, we just can't do this, it's an incitement to riot; but it was true to the character.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> It's curious that he should be so racist, given that your first impulse towards fiction came about because of witnessing racial bullying.</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> Well. that's really what art is about, you know. I think one is stung into progressive, positive behaviour by an awareness of the great lure of negative thought; it's the awareness of prejudice inside you that spurs you on to rid yourself and others of it. One of the things you should do in art is lift up the rock and look at those things inside you.</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> The words in Taxi Driver, both the dialogue and Travis's voice-over, are terrific. Are they as you wrote them, or did they come about from improvisation?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> The narration is as I wrote it. The dialogue is somewhat improvised - not to the extent of Raging Bull, say, but the most memorable piece of dialogue in the film is an improvisation: the \"Are you looking at me?\" part. In the script it just says, \"Travis speaks to himself in the mirror.\" Bobby asked me what he would say and I said, well, he's a little kid playing with guns and acting tough. So De Niro used this rap that an underground New York comedian had been using at the time as the basis for his lines.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Was the black comedy clear from the outset, or did that also develop from De Niro's performance?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> Both Marty and I were very attracted to the perverse singularity of vision - someone who says, \"I've gotta get healthy\" while he's swallowing pills - and to the self-contradictory nature of the character, which is where a lot of that humour comes from. Travis can't see that he is the one making himself lonely. He is the one making the world sordid, and you come to realise that the gimmick of the movie is to make you identify with him for simpler reasons, such as feeling oppressed by the city, and then gradually you're made aware that you have identified with someone you don't want to identify with, but now it's too late.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> One of the most disturbing qualities of Travis is his feeling of sexual disgust and rage. Does his attempted relationship with the Cybill Shepherd character amount to an attempt at health which just happens to fail, or has he somehow willed that failure?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> He wills it, though not consciously. Taxi Driver's plot structure is fairly simple. You have this pathologically lonely man confronted with two examples of femininity, one of which he desires but cannot have, the other of which he can have but does not desire. Now, obviously he's chosen objects which will exacerbate his own pathology - he doesn't really want a girl who will accept him, and when it seems as if the Cybill Shepherd character may, then in that unconsciously destructive way he takes her into an environment that will show her his real ugliness so that she will have to reject him.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Taking her to the porno cinema isn't just naivety?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> It plays like naivety - the character would say, \"Oh, stupid me, why did I go there?\" - but there was something in him that really wanted to shove her face in the filth that he felt, to dirty her, to say, \"Look at this: this is what I'm really like. How could you love someone like me?\" And then, from that step where you have these two feminine figures who must be unresolved, you just move on to the two father figures. He decides to kill the father figure of the girl who rejected him, which of course is a reflection of his own father figure, and when he is thwarted by that he moves on to the pimp, the other father figure. That isn't meant to indicate that a pimp and a politician are one and the same, but in his mind they are identical as father figures. Of course the irony of the film is that society puts value on one and not the other and says he's a hero. But it didn't really make any difference to him which one he was going to get.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Does the end of the film indicate that he's purged himself and is now safe and sane?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> No, I think the syndrome is just going to start all over again.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Did your feelings about the film change after the Hinckley affair at all?</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> No. I'm not opposed to censorship in principle - we can all agree on censorable things like child pornography - but I think that if you censor a film like Taxi Driver all you do is censor a film, not confront a problem. These characters are running around and can be triggered by anything, most often by advertisements or innocuous images. A few years ago they did a study about incitement to rape, and one of the things that cropped up most often was the old Coppertone suntan oil ad - it had a little puppy tugging at a girl's swimsuit. It had just the right mixture for these rapists of adolescent sexuality, female nudity, rear entry, animals, violence... So I think that if you do get involved in this kind of censorship you will end up having Raskolnikov, you just don't have Crime and Punishment.</p> <p><strong>KJ:</strong> But Taxi Driver now seems a different kind of film than it did before - more prophetic, more diagnostic.</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> When I talk to younger film-makers they tell me that it was really the film that informed them, that it was their seminal film, and listening to them talk I really can see it as a kind of social watermark. But it was meant as a personal film, not a political commentary. There was a very good feeling around the making of the film; everything felt right about it, and I remember the night before it opened we all got together and had dinner and said, \"No matter what happens tomorrow we have made a terrific movie, and we're damn proud of it even if it goes down the toilet.\" And the next day I got up and went over to the theatre for the noon show. There was a long line that went all the way around the block, but I absolutely had to be let in. And then I realised that this huge line was already for the two o'clock show, not the noon show! So I ran inside and watched the film and everyone was standing at the back and there was a sense of exhilaration about what we had done. We knew we'd never repeat it.</p>",
  "<p>A new firm of City private investigators opens its doors for business today in response to growing demand for corporate sleuths in the wake of the Enron and Worldcom scandals and amid increasing global insecurity. </p> <p>Corporate investigators are also featuring in takeover battles. Marks &amp; Spencer swept its offices for bugs when it was trying to fend off a bid from Philip Green, although it was careful not to suggest that Mr Green or his advisers had been involved in any of the alleged chicanery. </p> <p>A team of private investigators is said to be in Madrid, gathering intelligence on Banco Santander Central Hispano, which is vying to take over Abbey National. </p> <p>Grayson Pender Words worth has been set up by former executives from Kroll, one of the City's best known detective firms. </p> <p>Formed by Patrick Grayson, the former Kroll London chief, and two of Kroll's senior directors, Peter Pender-Cudlip and Andrew Wordsworth, who left the company in July, it will be competing with the likes of Kroll and Control Risk. </p> <p>Mr Pender-Cudlip says the market for corporate investigative services is growing rapidly because of increasing political and business uncertainty. </p> <p>\"People are much more cautious in their business dealings, so people are putting more resources into understanding the risks before they act,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This is an industry where size does not count. It is down to the knowledge and reach you have as well as the experience and contacts. Our strengths are that we are small and nimble.\" </p> <p>Although investigators have a secretive, clandestine image, their activity is not illegal. Much of their work involves the painstaking checking of companies' records or directors' CVs. </p> <p>Many of Grayson Pender Wordsworth's clients are likely to be private equity firms and hedge funds, as well as potential investors who want to check out the solidity of the companies they are interested in. </p> <p>\"The burden upon business people to gain a full and comprehensive understanding of the marketplace in which they operate and - most importantly - the credentials of those with whom they deal, has never been greater,\" said Mr Grayson.</p>",
  "For the older residents of this kibbutz, the break with the ideal came the day that some pay packets were fatter than others. And being asked to pay for lunch. <p>But they realised the tide had turned irrevocably with the hiring of Koby Lamm. Not only was he paid the market rate for running the sprawling agricultural and manufacturing kibbutz near the Sea of Galilee, but he was an outsider. A manager. Not a socialist. </p> <p>\"This is a big, big revolutionary change,\" said Aryeh Wolfin, who moved to Kibbutz Kfar Hanasi from London in 1958. \"The kibbutz as it was is dead. The egalitarian socialist society belongs to the past. Forget about it. This is the future of the kibbutz. </p> <p>\"Some people still yearn for the days of the old kibbutz. Some people who haven't adapted have a bitter taste. But I think we've saved the kibbutz.\" </p> <p>The kibbutz has iconic status in Israel, and shaped the world's view of the Jewish state over the decades when it was popularly seen as struggling for social justice as well as its survival. </p> <p>But the weight of an ageing population, young people more interested in personal enrichment than equality, and modern economic realities, have largely killed the guiding philosophy of \"from each according to their ability to each according to their needs\". </p> <p>In the past 20 years the population of Israel's 270 kibbutzim has fallen by about a quarter to 116,000. Three times as many people are leaving as joining. </p> <p>Most of those who go are young, leaving behind a population with an average age approaching 55 years. As a result, most of the communities can no longer afford the cradle-to-grave support for their members, with potentially tragic results for many older people who put in a lifetime of work in the belief that they would spend a secure retirement in the bosom of the kibbutz. </p> <p>Few own property, and if their kibbutz collapses - as several have - they face destitution. </p> <p>Kibbutz Kfar Hanasi sought to stave off the encroaching crisis in recent years with wage differentials, by charging for food and services and by permitting those who work outside the kibbutz to keep a proportion of their wages. </p> <p>\"No one left because of it,\" said Mr Lamm, the new kibbutz manager hired from the outside. \"The younger people wanted this change; the older people didn't like it, maybe, but understood they had to adapt.\" </p> <p>Now the government has opened the way to an even more dramatic shift by amending the law to permit private ownership of homes and factories by kibbutz members, provided that land and overall control of the means of production remains in communal hands. </p> <p>But with economic reform has often come an equally fundamental social change to entice back younger people, particularly those with children: abandoning an ideological system in which daily needs were met by centralised control of almost every aspect of life in favour of greater individual freedom, combined with a social safety net. </p> <p>The first kibbutzim were established nearly a century ago as stepping stones to a Jewish state. At Israel's turbulent birth in 1948, and in the following years, kibbutzim wereoften at the forefront of battles with Arab armies. </p> <p>Kibbutz Kfar Hanasi was founded on what had been Arab land within weeks of Israel's independence by members of a Jewish youth movement in Britain. </p> <p>Max Mader arrived from the UK a decade later with his German-born wife, who had escaped the Nazis. They landed in Israel, uncertain of what they would find, but clear about what they wanted to build. </p> <p>\"This was the place we were going to create a new society with a new set of values and new relations between men and women, with women being paid the same as men, and with salaries divorced from the work you do,\" he said. \"We were very proud of the fact that the lavatory cleaner earned the same as the head of the factory.\" </p> <p>Members of the kibbutz were assigned jobs, mostly on the land in the early days. The work was hard and the lifestyle harsh. </p> <p>\"There was motivation, there was a common aim,\" said Mr Mader. \"The problem was that within 10 years we passed the point of only providing for needs and had to start to answer the difficult question - how do you divide up the surplus?\" </p> <p>Kibbutz life fell under the control of the all-powerful governing committee. It decided who could study and who would have to work, who was permitted to travel and what luxuries were allowed. </p> <p>\"Personal decisions were not made personally,\" said Mr Mader. \"You weren't allowed to have a television set until a decision was made that everyone could have one. People did have them, but they would say it belonged to their uncle. </p> <p>\"In 1958, there was a lot of upheaval about a couple that left the kibbutz because she wanted to wear white socks and the committee only wanted to allow brown.\" </p> <p>Much heartache was generated by a requirement for children to sleep in a dormitory, known as \"the children's house\", in part to establish common purpose from an early age, but also to free their parents for work. </p> <p>For many years on Kibbutz Kfar Hanasi, parents were only permitted a few hours each week with their children. </p> <p>\"If I have one regret, my first two children slept in the children's house,\" said Mr Mader. \"Someone else was responsible for bathing them and changing their clothes and reading to them at bedtime. I would like to have participated in my children's upbringing.\" </p> <p>The system has been widely abandoned over the past 20 years under pressure from mothers. </p> <p>By the 1980s, the frontline had moved to the settlements in the occupied territories and the kibbutzim began to sag under the burden of heavy borrowing, rampant inflation and diminishing government subsidies. The young were increasingly reluctant to throw their wages into the communal pot, and a wave of immigrants from the former Soviet Union wanted nothing to do with a communal lifestyle. </p> <p>\"It was a very nice concept at the time and a tool when the country was being built,\" said Mr Wolfin, 70, who at first worked as a tractor driver before teaching history at the kibbutz school in later years. \"The kibbutz contribution in pioneering - building the country, building the society - was tremendous. But then we started getting a class system and capitalist economy and global economy and western values. The kibbutz had to adapt or disappear.\" </p> <p>The changes have reaped benefits. Kfar Hanasi's factory, manufacturing industrial valves, the chicken farm and orchards all make a profit under what many on the kibbutz acknowledge is more efficient management. </p> <p>But the changes go far beyond economics. \"It's also about reducing the amount of interference by the community in what you do,\" said Mr Mader. </p> <p>The kibbutz is seeking to reverse its falling population by building a satellite community in which families will buy their homes and keep their salaries, but rely on the kibbutz for services they pay for. They will not be members of the kibbutz, but will be expected to send their children to its schools and otherwise integrate into the community. </p> <p>The first few dozen plots have been sold and the houses are under construction. If the scheme works, it will provide profit and people. </p> <p>\"Today, I think it's generally accepted that the kibbutz is not remotely attractive for the reasons that brought us here. Now it's about quality of life, children's education, day care,\" said Mr Mader. \"People can live in the country, in small places. There's no buses, so we're not blown up [by terrorists' bombs].\" </p> <p>But there is one legacy the kibbutz dwellers cannot shake off. Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, recently praised the kibbutzim not for their socialist ideology or humanitarian principles, but as the forerunner of today's Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, thereby legitimising the settlements. </p> <p>Settlers often do the same. It infuriates Mr Mader. \"The attempt of the settlers in the West Bank and Gaza to say they are the true inheritors and we have played out our role, is very, very galling,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Odell is mistaken to apply his well-known belief in almost inexhaustible global oil resources to claim that most of the North Sea is under-explored (Brown's energy policy ignores home truths, August 21). The geology is now very well understood. The UK government is correct to admit at last that the country's oil and gas will be approaching exhaustion by 2020. </p> <p>The first 20bn barrels (Gb) had been found by 1970 after about 750 exploration wells. But the subsequent 2,000 wells were only able to deliver about 13Gb, despite all the well-documented advances in technology and geological knowledge. Although a favourable tax regime allowed most of the cost to be written off against taxable income, exploration drilling has fallen steeply since the 1990 peak. Why did this happen? Because progressively fewer viable prospects remain. It has been no mean achievement to hold discovery as high as has been the case in recent years and to do so with the high drilling success rate, implicit in the decline in the total number of wells drilled. </p> <p>Odell suggested that Britain should follow the Norwegian practice, which indeed was more efficient and closely controlled, with less wasted investment in dry holes. But discovery peaked there too in the late 1970s and the authorities have confirmed that production is set to decline steeply. </p> <p>The era of cheap oil is over. The problems of waste, pollution and resource depletion associated with the non-renewable resources can only be overcome by a gradual transition to a balanced ecological system. Rather than invest in drilling more dry holes in the North Sea, the only sensible long-term alternative for the UK is to improve energy efficiency and greatly increase investment in the new and renewable energy sources. To stop the lights going out in the short- term, no alternative power source should be ignored and serious consideration must be given to the next generation of nuclear power plants.<br> <strong>Prof Cleland McVeigh</strong><br> International Journal of Ambient Energy </p> <p> It is good to see that the US administration has stopped burying its head in the sand over climate change (Bush u-turn on climate change wins few friends, August 27). The UK government, on the one hand, praised for its involvement in the Kyoto protocol, is still pumping millions of pounds of taxpayer's money in to new oil development. At the same time, the so-called \"flexible mechanisms\" of Kyoto render the already measly target of 5% CO2 emissions cuts meaningless. </p> <p>Really dealing with climate change will mean fundamental lifestyle changes for those of us in the over-developed countries burning vastly more than our fair share of fossil fuels. Kyoto is off the rails. The scientific realities are hijacked by big business interests creating a market out of the air, and the UK government's position - cutting emissions while still funding new oil - is utterly hypocritical.<br> <strong>Matthew Carroll</strong><br> Rising Tide Climate Justice Network </p>",

Despite a reputed gentlemen's agreement between Premiership clubs that they would not poach each other's managers mid-season, Shepherd has apparently been foaming seductively while winking and tantalisingly tweaking his nipples in the direction of Bruce.

  "George Bush admitted yesterday the war on terror could not be won, as the Republican party convention, designed to showcase the president as a resolute leader at a time of national peril, was launched in New York. <p>The White House rushed to limit the potential damage as Democrats seized on the remarks as a sign of defeatism. A spokesman for the president said he was simply pointing out the unconventional nature of the conflict. </p> <p>However, the timing of the remarks could not have been worse for the president, coming on a day that the party had lined up two of its biggest names - Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor who led New York through the September 11 trauma, and John McCain, a Vietnam war hero - to pay tribute to his qualities as a wartime leader. </p> <p>\"So long as George Bush is president, is there any doubt they will continue to hear from us until we defeat global terrorism?\" Mr Giuliani said, according to an early text of a speech, that tied America's safety against terrorists to Mr Bush's hold on office. </p> <p>Asked on NBC television whether America could win its \"war on terror\", the president had replied: \"I don't think you can win it. But I think you can create conditions so that the - those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world.\" </p> <p>The comments represented a break from earlier determined predictions of victory, and drew an immediate Democratic response. </p> <p>\"After months of listening to the Republicans base their campaign on their singular ability to win the war on terror, the president now says we can't win the war on terrorism,\" John Edwards, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said. </p> <p>\"This is no time to declare defeat - it won't be easy and it won't be quick, but we have a comprehensive long-term plan to make America safer. And that's a difference.\" </p> <p>The White House spokesman Scott McClellan argued that the president was only being realistic about the nature of the struggle. \"He was talking about winning it in the conventional sense ... about how this is a different kind of war and we face an unconventional enemy,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>In the NBC interview, the president also made it clear that he had no intention of retreating in the face of the terrorist threat. That, he told the interviewer, \"would be a disaster for your children\". </p> <p>He added: \"You cannot show weakness in this world today because the enemy will exploit that weakness. It will embolden them and make the world a more dangerous place.\" </p> <p>As the controversy was unfolding, more than 4,000 Republican delegates were assembling in New York's Madison Square Garden arena, to begin the party's national convention. They acclaimed the submission of Mr Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, as the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees, and passed the party's manifesto without debate. </p> <p>Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, told the cheering delegates: \"Our platform highlights the principles that unite our party.\" But the manifesto has drawn criticism from party moderates for its uncompromising tone on a string of divisive social issues. It calls for abortion rights to be overturned, an end to stem cell research and a constitutional ban on gay marriage. </p> <p>Administration critics also pointed out the wide gap between the manifesto and the moderate face the party has donned for its four-day New York rally. Yesterday's prime time speakers, Mr Giuliani and Mr McCain are at odds with major elements of the platform. </p> <p>The two moderates focused instead on President Bush's martial virtues. \"He has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time, and I salute him,\" Senator McCain said. </p> <p>Mr Giuliani's speech stuck to the same theme. \"There are many qualities that make a great leader, but having strong beliefs, being able to stick with them through popular and unpopular times, is the most important characteristic of a great leader,\" an advance text of his speech said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Bush was touring New Hampshire and Michigan, two of about 20 swing states that will decide the election on November 2. Polls showed the contest still very close, but with the president's standing improving slightly to eliminate the narrow advantage John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, established after the Democratic party convention in Boston.</p>",
  "<p>Nuclear waste from overseas power stations has been sealed in concrete and buried in several miles of trenches in breach of official government policy, the Guardian can reveal. </p> <p>Ministers have repeatedly promised that nuclear waste from abroad will not be buried in British soil to make good a pledge that Britain will not become a nuclear waste dump for countries such as Japan, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. </p> <p>But it has now emerged that more than 10,000 cubic metres of foreign nuclear waste is buried at Drigg in Cumbria because it is too expensive to transport it back to the countries that produced it. If the waste was buried side by side the trench would stretch for more than 10 kilometres. </p> <p>It is part of an ever-increasing mountain of waste stored at more than 20 nuclear sites in Britain. Government advisers have warned that up to 20 million cubic metres of this waste will pile up in the coming years - and there is no way of disposing of nearly all of it. The government is currently spending \u00a31.3bn and is planning to increase this to \u00a32bn a year for the next 40 years to try to solve the mounting problems. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned from Department of Trade and Industry consultation documents and key advisers that the government is to announce a change in its official policy and start charging foreign governments for the service of storing their waste and subsequently disposing of it in concrete bunkers. </p> <p>Until now, the government has insisted that all the waste would be sent back but it now sees retaining foreign nuclear detritus as a money-spinning venture. </p> <p>Allowing Britain to become a dump for foreign waste would also remove another problem - the threat of terrorists hijacking the nuclear material while it was being transported from Britain to other countries. </p> <p>For decades, thousands of tonnes of spent fuel, containing plutonium and uranium, have been imported into Britain from nine countries which have contracts with the state-owned British Nuclear Fuels Ltd to have it reprocessed. </p> <p>Two BNFL plants at Sellafield in Cumbria dissolve the fuel in acid and extract the plutonium and uranium so that it can be returned to those countries either for storage or reuse in nuclear stations. </p> <p>In practice not even this has happened and the plutonium and uranium remain at Sellafield under guard. </p> <p>In addition there is 405 cubic metres of high level waste and 3,383 cubic metres of intermediate level waste belonging to foreign countries stored at Sellafield. </p> <p>The UK has more than 10,000 cubic metres of high level waste of its own and another 250,000 tonnes of intermediate level waste. Once packaged into containers suitable for disposal the waste can be 10 times as bulky. </p> <p>Britain's own waste is in a series of deteriorating buildings at Sellafield and at least 19 other sites around the UK. </p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for the environment, said of the Guardian revelations: \"This is a disgrace. We have enough dangerous nuclear waste of our own without scooping in other countries' waste. </p> <p>\"The Treasury and Depart ment of Trade and Industry do not mind endangering the environment as they attempt to reduce the horrendous amount of taxpayer's money that the nuclear industry generates. This government cannot be trusted to tell the truth, look after the environment or deal with the nuclear industry in any sort of sensible way.\" </p> <p>Blake Lee-Harwood, campaigns director of Greenpeace, said: \"It is absolutely shocking that the government is reneging on one of its key promises [that nuclear waste] would all be returned to its country of origin. </p> <p>\"This bodes ill for the future imports of spent fuel and the planned return of other wastes.\" </p> <p>The government set up an expert committee of radioactive waste management to advise on what to do about the problem of nuclear waste. </p> <p>Due to report by 2006, the committee has been first try ing to discover exactly how much waste there is in Britain and will then consider how to get rid of the plutonium and uranium that has been produced from reprocessing. </p> <p>The committee chairman, Gordon MacKerron, admitted: \"It has always seemed to me unlikely that all the foreign wastes would be returned.\" </p> <p>Laurence Williams, the chief health and safety inspector of Britain's nuclear sites, said his task was making sure the existing wastes stored round Britain were kept in a safe state. </p> <p>\"The mind boggles that scientists and technicians who did all these complex tasks like building nine nuclear power stations in 11 years, and ... built hydrogen bombs and reprocessing plants, could at the same time have chucked highly active waste into silos with no thought how to get it out,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This is what we now have to do, and it is no easy task.\" </p> <p>The Guardian has applied under the \"open government\" code for details of contracts between the British and Italian governments, but the DTI, which is responsible for BNFL, has refused to release anything. </p> <p>The DTI claims that disclosure of the \"sensitive\" information would embarrass the Italian government and create diplomatic tension between London and Rome. </p> <p>Nuclear waste is divided into three categories - high level, intermediate level and low level based on the level and type of radioactivity. </p> <p>Of most concern is the high level waste. It is so radioactive that it produces heat and has been kept in liquid form in tanks for up to 50 years at Sellafield before being turned into glass blocks for storage. The government admits that a quarter of this type of waste belongs to foreign governments. </p> <p>Intermediate level waste is not heat-producing and can be packaged in concrete for safety. Both these types need to be isolated from human contact for up to 200,000 years. </p> <p>The low level waste is by far the greatest volume and includes everything from gloves and overalls to large pieces of equipment and concrete. The only place to store this in Britain is Drigg, which will be full by 2050. </p> <p>Government advisers estimate that there will be enough low-level waste produced in the next 50 years to fill 15 Drigg dumps. </p> <p>The DTI was unable to comment on the disposal of foreign waste yesterday.</p>",
  "The track over Hallam moor, above Sheffield, is a public footpath that crosses some of the most exhilarating, windswept upland in England. There are views to Derwent and Strines moors to the north, Ughill to the east, and the heather-clad peaks of Winnow and Kinder Scout far to the west. <p>It is a windswept, top-of-the-world place, the closest England has to wilderness, but it is practically all forbidden country. Step off the track in any direction, walk in the heather, strike out to the peaks, or to the old standing stones, bronze age settlements or isolated tors, and a gamekeeper or landowner can tell you to leave. </p> <p>Terry Howard, secretary to the Sheffield campaign for access to moorland (Scam) and chairman of the local ramblers, is not bothered. </p> <p>These moors, for him and thousands of others, he says, are now the promised land and this is a moment that he has been waiting for for more than 50 years. </p> <p>He plunges off the track straight into the deep heather, crosses a peaty stream and heads to a stone boundary marker that was flattened years ago to discourage people walking on the moors. </p> <p>Technically, Mr Howard is trespassing on the land of Jeremy Archdale, whose large house, Moskar Lodge, is in the valley below. </p> <p>But the days of Hallam moor gamekeepers or Sheffield industrialists ordering Mr Howard or other ramblers off their moorland are mostly over, and in just over two weeks' time some 100 sq miles of Peak District national park moor, heath and mountain will be declared officially \"open access\" for the first time since the enclosure acts of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. </p> <p>The change will more than double the amount of land open to walkers in the park and will be the culmination of one of the longest and most bitter social and environmental campaigns in British history. </p> <p>Laws giving people more access to the uplands were proposed more than 100 years ago, but have always failed until the freedom to roam was enshrined in the Countryside Rights of Way Act (Crow), promised by the Labour party in the 1990s and steered through parliament by the then environment minister, Michael Meacher, in 2000. </p> <p>It comes into force in the Peak District on September 19 and in a rolling programme over the next two years is expected to make almost 3,200 sq miles of land in England and Wales accessible to walkers. </p> <p>In effect, says Mr Howard, now deep in the heather, a new area the size of many counties will be opened up for exploration, discovery and enjoyment. </p> <p>\"This is unbelievable,\" he says. \"There's been no access on these lands for generations. It's been a bloody long time coming. </p> <p>\"These are the places where you get away to and clear all the crap, where you get back to the cities from and feel better, where you get wet and knackered but can clear the mind. It's magic, isn't it?\" </p> <p>It is proper, he says, that the Peak District should be the first to benefit from the new laws. The moors here, at the back door of Manchester, Derby, Sheffield and other industrial towns, have been a catalyst for radical political thought for generations and the scene of some of the most famous battles in English social history. </p> <p>Mass trespasses on Kinder Scout and other moors in the early 1930s by socialist, com munist and youth groups led directly to the great rallies of the 1940s which pressed for the formation of Britain's national parks and led to the development of today's environment and conservation movements. </p> <p>Mr Howard, who was a founder member of Scam, trespassed with others on the moors almost every week during the 1980s and 1990s to try to keep the issue on the political agenda. </p> <p>\"We had huge support, from the police and everyone. In the past every footstep was a political statement. Now every step will be a celebration. It's a lifetime's expectation, difficult to believe. </p> <p>\"All the crap we've put up with, and the excuses for why it shouldn't happen before. It is almost surreal to be here. Future generations should not take this for granted.\" </p> <p>Since the act was passed in 2000 Mr Howard has been working with local groups, landowners and the Peak District national park to prepare for the changes. Hundreds of new gates and signs are being put in and new maps prepared. </p> <p>\"As it's got nearer there's been a quiet acceptance by the landowners. One or two have been obstructive and are sticking it out but most are relatively calm. </p> <p>\"Only two individuals in the Peak District have applied for total closures. </p> <p>\"By law they now have to open up the land but they can apply for restrictions. </p> <p>\"I do understand the landowners' reticence, but in many respects they brought it on themselves. If in the early days they had gone for access agreements this would never have happened. </p> <p>\"In England there's always been this attitude about land. I would like to think my trespass days are over, but there are bound to be niggles. But now we've got it, let's use it and look after it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The rightwing thinktank, Civitas, the Institute for the Study of Civil Society, better known for its opposition to immigration and asylum, is to open a new school this autumn in a bid to preserve \"the values and knowledge on which the survival of the culture depends\". Can anyone set up a private school? Who governs what they do and don't teach?</p> <p>The first route to establishing a private school is raising the money to purchase property and to hire teachers. Then there's the development of a curriculum, something that Civitas is still working on as the doors to its west London primary prepare to open.</p> <p>A new private school must register with the Department for Education and Skills, initially that will be subject to an Ofsted inspection of its provision. If it's not on their register it's operating illegally. An independent school is defined as somewhere where five or more pupils of compulsory school age (5-16) are taught full time without money from the public purse.</p> <p>The Education Act 2002 states that independent schools must reach a satisfactory standard in respect of the quality of education provided, the \"spiritual, moral, social and cultural developments of pupils\", the welfare, health and safety of pupils and the premises and accommodation at the school. They must also establish a complaints procedure for parents.</p> <p>But they don't have to comply with the national curriculum, and are free to teach what they like as long as it doesn't contravene any of the existing laws, such as those which rule against inciting racial hatred. </p> <p>Nor do private schools have to offer the same qualifications as state schools. Recently some have switched to the international baccalaureate following the continuing rows over whether the A-level is fit for purpose. At primary level independent schools - or prep schools - do not have to take part in national tests although two thirds of them do. </p> <p>This has so far sparked the odd row. Religious schools that have taught creationist views alongside the traditional scientific explanations of how the world came into being have come in for criticism.</p> <p>However this has not been restricted to private schools. </p> <p>The King's Academy in Middlesbrough has fought, and failed, to shrug off the controversy stirred up by its sponsor, Sir Peter Vardy, the car-hire knight with unorthodox views on creationism that he has sought to impose on the curriculum. </p> <p>People who want to get into the schools' management game might consider academies. It's not profit-making, but there's far less risk involved. The Tony Blair-backed schools are introduced to replace the most failing schools. A private sponsor puts in \u00a32m, while the government gives \u00a322m towards new buildings and funds the on-going running costs. Meanwhile the sponsor is free to run the school essentially as a private school. </p> <p>The sponsor gets overall control of the school's governing body and is not bound by the national curriculum.</p> <p>The inevitable question is do we want politically or morally minded groups to be running schools? The government says yes there should be more individuals running schools; it points to the Ofsted reports that are favourable to faith schools and the need to \"reinvigorate\" areas which are being failed by their schools. However, the teacher organisations are sceptical. They fear the creeping privatisation of state schools, and the influence that it brings. </p> <p>But the government has 200 more planned for the next six years. In the same time frame Dubai-based Global Education Management Systems - Gems - is planning another 120 cut-price private school places at the cost of \u00a35,000 a year to parents. The schools' landscape is most definitely changing.</p>",
  "There are more twists and turns backstage at the Grand Theatre in Leeds than in the plot of the most bizarre verismo opera that has ever graced its stage. <p>But within two years, the quirks and inconveniences of the elegant grade II* listed building will be ironed out in a \u00a331.5m transformation worthy of a panto production of Cinderella. </p> <p>By mid 2006, Opera North, whose new production of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice opens at the Edinburgh Festival tomorrow, will have the home it deserves in the city which sees more opera performances than any other outside London. </p> <p>\"The project will enable us to do what, as a national opera company based outside London, we should be doing,\" said Richard Mantle, Opera North's general director. </p> <p>\"The theatre is the biggest tool we have. All we do here needs to be driven by art and this will be a better environment in which art can be developed.\" </p> <p>Everyone gains: staff, singers, audiences. And there will be immediate spin-offs for the repertory: \"We are desperate to bring back bigger operas - [Verdi's] Don Carlos and Peter Grimes and the larger Britten works. We also want to do Janacek's The Makropoulos Case and we have a world premiere lined up for 2007-08.\" </p> <p>Opera North, based in Leeds for 26 years, is on a roll. It has a new music director (Richard Farnes) and has just completed a run of \"eight little greats\", a clutch of shorter operas offered in double bills. </p> <p>Audiences could pay to see just one or both. It was a nice bit of marketing (although it worked better at Sadler's Wells in London than on some other regular tour dates) and won critical praise. </p> <p>Now, as the Grand prepares to close next spring for more than a year, the company has announced its next seven operas in a flurry of activity designed to compensate for the loss of an autumn season next year and show that the renovation scheme will not stifle theatrical creativity. </p> <p>Six of the planned shows are new productions and four are international collaborations. This autumn will see Orfeo (with a dance input), Puccini's Manon Lescaut and Mozart's Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte. </p> <p>Winter will bring a revival of Kurt Weill's rarely seen One Touch of Venus, with many of the team who produced the company's version of Paradise Moscow, a Shostakovich romp. </p> <p>Venus will tour to eight venues with Rossini's The Thieving Magpie and Mozart's Don Giovanni, stopping off for two weeks rather than the usual one in both Nottingham and Newcastle before crossing the Irish Sea for the company's first visit to Belfast. </p> <p>A month later a run of semi-staged performances of Bartok's Duke Bluebeard's Castle will tour concert halls in Leeds and other regional cities. </p> <p>\"This is a work we want to do but would struggle to perform in the theatres we visit because of the size of the orchestra it needs,\" said Mr Mantle. </p> <p>\"The flexibility of the building will help us get back to a larger repertory than we tend to be able to mount at the moment.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile the builders will have moved into the Grand, built in 1878 to designs by George Gorson, who created a facade which, with its rose window, presents a curious Yorkshire melange of Gothic and Romanesque. </p> <p>Mr Mantle says the company has learned from the disastrous Covent Garden experience about how to manage a shut-down. \"We have tried to keep faith with our audiences and take the risk out. We hope the absence of the Grand will be hardly noticed.\" </p> <p>Arts Council England has chipped in \u00a315m towards the renovations bill and Leeds city council, which owns the building, has contributed \u00a35.5m as part of a \u00a3125m sport and culture investment programme. A bid has been submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund and a \u00a35.5m public appeal launched. </p> <p>The scheme will bring all artistic activity on to one site - the orchestra at presents rehearses in a school hall remote from the theatre. </p> <p>Part of the trick is to move departments out of the Grand and into a nearby office block linked to the theatre by new bridges. This will provide new rehearsal rooms; the music library will emerge from its overflowing corner and the costume department will have room to swing a cloak. </p> <p>Scene-shifters will no longer have to dangle out of a scene dock on ropes because a new lift will raise articulated lorries from the street to stage level. </p> <p>They will also benefit from plans to bring the fly-tower up to date and make it depend less on strong ropes and fat muscles. The orchestra will sit in a deeper pit and audiences on 1,500 new seats with a steeper rake in the stalls for better sightlines. Air conditioning will be improved and there will be greatly improved access for disabled people. </p> <p>But the jewel in the scheme is the restoration of the gracious Assembly Rooms, designed as part of the theatre complex, converted into a cinema in 1912 but unused by the public since 1978. This will become home for Opera North's orchestra and a space for rehearsals, small-scale productions, education and, with its original social function restored, corporate mingling. </p> <p>\"The Victorians saw this whole building as an arts centre,\" said Mr Mantle. \"In some ways, we want to get back to the ideas that those visionaries had for this site.\"</p>",

  "Perhaps it is his long, girly eyelashes or Tintin hair, but Graydon Carter has the air of someone not altogether serious. He edits Vanity Fair, the magazine of lush exteriors, a position he has held for 12 years and which confers on him an almost aristocratic status in American journalism. When we meet in a London hotel, Carter practically glides into the room, propelled by the sail-power in his billowing white shirt. He once founded a satirical magazine and has kept the habit of sardonic delivery. \"Oh, completely, always,\" he says drily, when asked if he gets unfairly categorised as a fluffy celebrity-worshipper; he smiles and looks away with a distant, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger sort of look. \"But that's natural.\" <p>Carter fights his reputation as a lightweight, but even he admits that he is surprised by the book he has just written. During his editorship of Vanity Fair, the 55-year-old has made a point of neither voting nor buying shares, a position of lofty disinterest from which he descends with a 340-page polemic attacking Bush and comparing Donald Rumsfeld to Hermann Goering. </p> <p>What We've Lost: How the Bush Administration Has Curtailed Freedoms, Ravaged the Environment and Damaged America and the World is a book that has been assembled rather more than written. With great recourse to lists and bullet-point breakdowns, it audits Bush's shortcomings across every department of government, opening each chapter with one of the president's goofy quotes (\"It's clearly a budget. It's got lots of numbers in it\") then slamming home wave after wave of damning facts and anecdotes: that Bush tried to reclassify \"manufacturing\" jobs to include people who worked in fast-food joints; that teachers in Missouri were ordered to remove every third light bulb from schools to save money; that parents of soldiers in Iraq were in some cases forced to buy their children's own body-armour vests (\"$1,500 retail\"), plus hundreds of statistics attesting to Bush's failure to help America's poor, sick and discriminated against. The result is so overwhelming that it reads a little as if someone has fed \"Bush, presidency, fuck up\" into a search engine on the internet and loosely organised the results. Carter says he intended to write a short handbook, but that the more he and his researchers looked into it, the longer the book got. </p> <p>\"We had meetings on the research every couple of days; we went through 30,000 reports - it was daunting, what the Bush administration had done,\" he says. \"I went into this thinking I knew maybe a 10th of it; I didn't know the 1,000th of it. I'm really crummy at deadlines - which is strange, 'cos I'm a very punctual person usually for lunches - and a really slow writer, but I had to do this in four months and worked till 2am every morning. I was saying to my kids, the one thing this book did was use my brain cells, 'cos I've been an editor so long. An editor rarely uses his brain; he uses his gut more than his brain. My brain was worn out, the tips of my fingers were worn out.\" </p> <p>With this book and the Vanity Fair editorials in which he rehearsed its outraged tone, Carter joins what might be regarded as the cultural opposition to Bush, a loose alliance that numbers among its members Michael Moore, the comic Al Franken, and the shock-jock Howard Stern - and which some suggest has done more to help dislodge Bush from the White House than full- time politicians like the anaemic John Kerry. Carter downplays his own influence. \"I'm sort of flattered to be included with those guys,\" he says. \"They are more vocal than I am, but I try to stay independent. The fact is that their greatest influence is in the Democratic states; when the cultural elite endorses a candidate anywhere else, people tend to run for the hills.\" Is the fact that people like Moore and Carter put so much energy into trashing Bush an indication of John Kerry's failure to do so? \"No. I'm not in the least disappointed with Kerry. I think he's a perfect candidate; honest, forthright and he plays fairly. He is a very brave man. The thing people forget is that the only reason Bush looks presidential, is because he is president. You could stick Michael Moore on Air Force One and he'd look presidential, too.\" </p> <p>Carter's Vanity Fair editorials, formerly chatty introductions to the articles in that issue, now bolts of hellfire, can sit a little strangely with the Annie Leibowitz celebrity love-ins, although this, he says, is the magazine's magic: soft on the outside, hard on the inside. Carter has been angry before, of course; he characterises himself as a \"very angry young man\" in the years when he set up and edited Spy, the satirical magazine, with Kurt Anderson, which mocked the very world Vanity Fair now celebrates. But, says Carter, you can't carry on being furious like that and as he got older, got married and had four children (he is divorced now and engaged to Anna Scott, a British PR), he found he was quite content, not a good stance for a satirist. \"But this got me up again,\" he says, \"in the way I haven't felt since my early 30s. It was a sense of outrage as you went along.\" The thing that most shocked him was the discovery that \"the Bush administration is doing everything in its power to cut back the benefits for veterans, both of past wars and of the troops in Iraq now\". </p> <p>Does he at least think Bush believes he is doing the right thing? \"I don't know. I don't know how you think you are doing the right thing by having a tax system that barely affects the middle class, and makes life so much easier for so many wealthy people. America has almost too many wealthy people and the tax cuts were designed for them.\" </p> <p>Some of Carter's friends warned him off doing the book - \"You gotta be crazy,\" he recalls them saying, \"they'll come after you\" - but in fact, if anyone is going to come after Carter, it is more likely to be his cohorts in the media. Already, bitchy remarks are circulating about the number of researchers Carter used (nine), which he responds to with a sigh and says: \"The fact is I have a full-time job and four kids and I'm not much of a researcher myself. The fact is, unlike a lot of writers, I credit the people who help me. A lot of writers out there have a ton of researchers and they don't get credited in the book. So.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year Carter found himself attacked simultaneously in the New York Times and LA Times, with stories about a payment he received, some $100,000, for recommending the novel A Beautiful Mind as a film project to the producer, Brian Grazer, and the director, Ron Howard. It is not unusual for film ideas to come from magazines - another Russell Crowe flick, Proof of Life, came from a long Vanity Fair article about the kidnap and ransom industry - but there were whispers about the propriety of the magazine's editor having a stake in a film which, through his magazine, he was in such a good position to promote. The surrounding furore took oxygen from a certain dislike of Carter's style, in the same way that his predecessor at Vanity Fair, Tina Brown, was so eagerly mocked for her failure at Talk magazine. But there was also a genuine unease at the relationship of journalists such as Carter to the people they report on; Howard and Grazer appeared in the Vanity Fair top powerbrokers list and the film, which won an Oscar, was obviously well covered in the magazine. </p> <p>\"Confused, not bruised,\" he says of the episode. \"I had no idea where it was coming from. It was just a ... I was being criticised for being successful. I do documentary films on the side, one of which is called 9/11 and is about these two documentary film-makers and the twin towers, and one called the Kid Stays in the Picture, about the life of Bob Evans. I loved doing them, they're really fun and they did well. And I think that in some circles it's going to cause some envy and I think this came from envy more than anything else, and envy is a characteristic I literally can't understand.\" </p> <p>This is the kind of defence to get Carter detractors howling, proof of how far he has come since his days at Spy, an egomaniac who, by his own admission, oversees every caption and headline in the magazine, having tried delegation and found it \"didn't work\". Against the weight of his new book, Carter enemies might posit a daffy exchange he once had with Nicole Kidman, who interviewed him for another magazine. </p> <p>NK: What keeps you curious? Isn't that a lovely word? What's your favourite word? </p> <p>GC: My favourite word? It's canoe. I love the word canoe and all that it implies and the history of the canoe and all the rest of it. The canoe is a big part of Canadian culture. </p> <p>NK: That's very strange. Canooooo, canooooo . . . It is a nice word. </p> <p>GC: What's your favourite word? </p> <p>NK: Bliss. </p> <p>Carter rolls his eyes at this and in his best sardonic drawl says: \"Canoe is still one of my favourite words.\" He insists he isn't grand - \"Grand in what way?\" he says, looking bemused - that he always eats \"in the same crummy restaurant\" in his neighbourhood in New York, that he doesn't go to black-tie events, that at the Vanity Fair Oscars party he doesn't work the room. Jesus, he's not even American, he's Canadian, from a modest upbringing outside Ottawa. </p> <p>Nevertheless, I suggest that there is a problem with the power exerted by the Hollywood PR machine over magazines such as Vanity Fair: don't they have to suck-up to succeed? </p> <p>\"I think that's absolutely non-existent. I think it's the most oversold story in the world. Because I've never found any kind of obstruction, pressure, anything, ever.\" </p> <p>This isn't what I've heard; Lynn Barber, for example, had to leave Vanity Fair after offending one of Hollywood's most powerful PRs and being told, in not so many words, that she would never work in this town again. </p> <p>\"Well, the trouble is for Lynn to work, you've got to get the other person to sit down. Well, you can't put a gun to someone's head and say you have to sit down in this chair opposite Lynn. If Lynn could do her job without co-operation, she'd still be on staff. But it only works if you get a willing subject, and we ran out of willing subjects in the US.\" </p> <p>But surely that's an example of the power of the PR handlers? \"No, I don't know if it was that or not. I think she did a story on Michael Caine that he wasn't thrilled with. But it's not about that. That is the single most oversold, erroneous story in journalism.\" </p> <p>Whenever he can, says Carter, he tries to get a non-film star on the cover - \"even a musician is better\" - while trying to keep \"the utterly loathsome\" off the front page. It is getting harder; \"the level of celebrity in America now is so low,\" he says, \"so unbelievably low.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the staff at the magazine are proud he has added its voice to the political debate; if the book sells just one copy, he says, he'll \"have felt I have done my part\". There is a point in What We've Lost wherein the two sides of Carter meet, a classic, Vanity Fair moment in which he quotes from a phone-in that took place last year on the political TV channel, C-Span. Half way through the conversation, it becomes clear that the caller complaining about Bush is an entertainer of some sort; after pressing for her identity, to no avail, the presenter eventually says in amazement: \"Is this Cher ?\" It is. </p> <p>The lesson is clear: when even the celebrities are getting mad with Bush, we had jolly well better sit up and listen. This year, Graydon Carter will be voting.</p>",
  "Two of America's most popular politicians took centre stage on the opening night of the Republican convention to help sell George Bush to moderate voters and undermine his Democrat rival, John Kerry. <p>Senator John McCain, whom Mr Kerry courted as a possible running mate, praised Mr Bush as a president who \"has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time\". </p> <p>Rudolph Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, likened the president to Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill, calling him a leader who was \"prepared to stick with difficult decisions even as public opinion shifts\". </p> <p>The tone of the convention, symbolically set in New York, was established early in the evening with a brief homily from the first Muslim chaplain of the city's police department, who called for cultural differences to be set aside for the sake of common humanity.</p> <p>\"One America united against terrorism under George Bush\" was the theme of the night, and the powerful advocates chosen to convey that message were Senator McCain, from Arizona, and \"America's mayor\", Rudy Giuliani, both of whom have the unusual ability to transcend bitter partisan boundaries and reach the political centre.</p> <p>After months of shoring up the base, White House and party strategists must use the primetime slots this week to convince swing voters that President Bush has not utterly forsaken the \"compassionate conservatism\" of his 2000 campaign, despite the lack of evidence in office.</p> <p>Within the fortified walls of Madison Square Garden, the convention is as carefully and professionally produced as any of the slick daytime television programmes it is trying to emulate. </p> <p>The theme of coming together in defence of liberty and the flag was carefully fleshed out with tributes to war heroes - and war victims - at home and abroad.</p> <p>Before the appearance of Senator McCain, delegates and the cable television audience were repeatedly reminded of the sacrifices made on September 11 and on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. </p> <p>A variety of performers and politicians combined to present the argument that President Bush had no choice but to react in defence of the country by going on the attack.</p> <p>Tonight's star turn will be from Terminator-turned-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, while the president himself speaks on Thursday evening. </p> <p>Senator McCain's emphatic endorsement means a great deal to the Bush campaign. It is hard to believe that only a few months ago Senator Kerry was seriously courting the maverick senator and fellow Vietnam veteran to be his Democratic running mate. In the 2000 Republican primary race, the Bush campaign was accused of smearing the senator during a protracted and bitter contest.</p> <p>But last night there was no hint of ambiguity in the rallying cry to give the president another four years: \"We need a leader with the experience to make the tough decisions and the resolve to stick with them, a leader who will keep us moving forward even if it is easier to rest,\" said the senator.</p> <p>\"This president will not rest until America is stronger and safer still and this hateful iniquity is vanquished. He has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time, and I salute him.\"</p> <p>Without mentioning John Kerry by name, he stuck the knife in and twisted it, implying that the Democrat challenger was not up to the job of making tough decisions and sticking to them.</p> <p>The loudest and most sustained booing of the night was reserved for another opponent whom the senator identified but did not name: when he mentioned \"a disingenuous film-maker who would have us believe that Saddam's Iraq was an oasis of peace\" every delegate in the hall seemed to hiss just at the thought of Michael Moore's bulky frame.</p> <p>Some of the sharp-eyed state representatives in the hall might have noticed that Mr Moore himself was actually there, grinning and waving for the network cameras. He is present all week, penned inside the press area as a guest newspaper columnist.</p> <p>While McCain built a slow, eloquent case for supporting the president as the only safe pair of hands, his was ultimately a mainstream appeal to transcend party and put America first: \"Stick together. Stay strong... Stand up with our president and fight.\"</p> <p>When Mr Giuliani came to the podium he followed a highly emotive and choreographed segment featuring three blonde and photogenic women in mourning who had lost men to the terrorists on 9/11. A cloying, unaccompanied version of Amazing Grace swiftly followed.</p> <p>Speaking for around twice as long as Senator McCain, Mr Giuliani was happy to name names and to take an even broader sweep through the historical causes and possible remedies for America's reluctant war on terror. </p> <p>Senator McCain has already had his presidential run, but the former mayor of New York is constantly being tipped for a governorship or White House role in the near future.</p> <p>He says he will not properly consider his political future until after November.</p> <p>At times deviating extremely from the script, he used his unique authority at the heart of the September 11 recovery effort to paint a portrait of a heroic president who understood what needed to be done in response: Bush, he said, had taken the Churchillian path by using \"offence\" as the best defence.</p> <p>\"For that, and then his determined effort to defeat global terrorism no matter what happens in this election, President George W Bush already has earned a place in our history as a great American president,\" he said.</p> <p>Running through a list of past terrorist atrocities, he first damned John Kerry with faint praise, saying that he respected him \"for his service to our nation\". Then he moved on to the attack: Bush, he said was \"a leader who is willing to stick with difficult decisions even as public opinion shifts\", while Kerry's record in office suggested \"a man who changes his position often, even on important issues\".</p> <p>He painted a portrait of an indecisive liberal who would pander to European sensibilities rather than put America first: \"John Kerry's claim that certain foreign leaders who opposed our removal of Saddam Hussein prefer him raises the risk that he would accommodate his position to their viewpoint.\"</p> <p>It was a powerful speech designed to elevate not only a grateful president but also to leave an ambitious and popular politician with as many options open as possible. The \"Rudy doctrine\" is clearly a work in progress.</p>",
  "<p>In 1982, the designer and critic Michael Sorkin wrote of Los Angeles: \"LA is probably the most mediated town in America, nearly unviewable save through the fictive scrim of its mythologisers.\" The myth has taken many forms: a cultured place of opulence under Hispanic rule; the land of plenty glimpsed by early settlers; the city that tempted the nascent movie business to leave the east coast of the US for the perfect light and climate of the west. </p> <p>For Orson Welles, Los Angeles was \"a bright, guilty place\". For Tom Cruise, in the character of Vincent in Michael Mann's new film, it is \"sprawled out and disconnected\". </p> <p>Mann is the pre-eminent mythologiser of contemporary LA, the man who brought Welles's bright, guilty vision to life in Heat, where the shootouts were as bloated as the egos of the protagonists. Collateral, his latest, is big news: Tom Cruise's smiling face stared out of almost every major US film magazine in the run-up to its release, with much being made of Tom going grey (!) and Tom playing a baddie (!!). </p> <p>Entertaining as that might be, it misses the point about Collateral. Among the big summer releases in the US, it is in a class of its own: measured, polished, the product of a combination of a major studio and major talent that - for once - means something. </p> <p>Mann, who was born in Chicago but studied at the London Film School, made his name with the television series Miami Vice and the film Manhunter, an early version of the Hannibal Lecter story. He really made his mark in a creative burst that started in 1992, when he directed The Last of the Mohicans, followed by Heat, The Insider and Ali. </p> <p>Now he has returned to the scene of Heat, this time with a different crime - exit bank robbers, enter assassin - and a different feel for the city. In Collateral, the clear daylight of Heat is replaced by the soft luminosity of the LA night. </p> <p>\"I wanted to see the colour of night in LA the way that it really is,\" Mann says. A neat, intense figure, he talks about the look of his latest film with an almost detached passion. \"Our eyes adapt - we start to see things as grey and white that aren't grey and white. In this film, the lights are all apricot because all the streetlights here are sodium vapour. That really is the colour of LA.\" Mann deals in the dark side of the myth of Los Angeles: the myth of noir, the \"anti-myth\", as the city's defining chronicler, Mike Davis, refers to it in his book City of Quartz. </p> <p>Collateral takes place over the course of one night. Vincent, a hit man, arrives in the city to execute five killings before hopping on a plane at 6.30 the next morning; his mode of transport is a taxi driven by Max, played by Jamie Foxx. Vincent and Max are Mann archetypes, cool, calm professionals: while Max can calculate a journey time to the minute, Vincent controls all he surveys, including Max. But once the first killing goes awry - the uncooperative corpse crashes out of a window to land on the roof of the waiting taxi - Vincent's world starts to unravel. </p> <p>Mann sets his vision of LA on the roads that sketch an endless grid across the city. Far from sticking to the beautiful cool of the chrome and glass skyscrapers of corporate downtown, he also makes use of the other LA: the seedy streets of Koreatown, the gaudy new money of the Latino neighbourhood of Pico Rivera, the forgotten areas of the south where the belching chimneys of old industry struggle to find a place in the new economy. </p> <p>Mann uses the location to frame the fragmentation of the forced relationship between Vincent and Max. \"I wanted to serve notice way up in front of the film that there's something confrontationally direct coming. And I wanted to get intimacy that doesn't belong. So I set it off against the most oppositional environment I could imagine, the most impersonal, unpopulated industrial landscape I could find - the vacant parts of the Wilmington oil fields and refineries. </p> <p>\"All the locations I picked were the product of some kind of story analysis,\" he adds. \"Nothing's by accident.\" Coming from Mann, an obsessive at the top of his game, this is not a surprise. Collateral is a tight film, every frame telling us something that we need to know. </p> <p>Mann has moved to a digital camera for Collateral. Unexpectedly, he elicits an almost painterly effect from it. The freeways have the texture of pale brown canvases; the tones of the night sky are otherworldly. The journey through Koreatown, which Max appears unlikely to survive, is, Mann tells me, \"a final journey through night in which a man has truly lost his own head space. It's a moment when a guy is going to enter into some kind of a fatal conflict, and he's thinking his own thoughts, and hence the drive evolves in neon.\" </p> <p>While Mann's visual lyricism can burn on to your retinas, his use of sound - music and noise - can make your head throb. In one climactic scene, set high in a skyscraper, a tense chase played out to a pounding beat is interrupted by the serene swoop of a police helicopter passing through the vertiginous towers. The visual jar of the moment is emphasised by a sudden switch to a single, near-silent, sustained high note. </p> <p>\"That was an accident,\" Mann says. \"We were shooting out of the window and someone says, 'There's a helicopter.' I said, 'Grab that shot,' and we grabbed the helicopter going by. With video you can shoot everything any time, almost. </p> <p>\"The thing that was interesting to me, and determined a lot of strategy about the music, is that I was making an entire motion picture out of only the third act. This is the denouement: the finale is at the very beginning of the movie and that's it. Dr Strangelove's the same, in that it begins with the ending. Sterling Hayden launches, that's it, they're gone. Two acts probably built up to that.\" </p> <p>That, he says, has an effect on the musical and visual rhythm of the film. \"Each scene is two or three times its normal size. The conflict in the club is nine minutes long. Every molecule of the film is stretched. I wanted to do a film like this before I even got the Collateral script - a film where events would be seen through a microscope. It's a miniature, seen large, seen close up.\" </p> <p>Collateral's denouement takes place on that most un-LA of things, the public transportation system, specifically the metro lines that serve the less fashionable parts of town. But even that held delights for Mann. \"We were on the green line, on the blue line. They're fabulous, they're gorgeous. In the station that we ended in, there are fantasised outer-space dioramas embedded in the walls. It is just phenomenal. Some of the best public architecture around. And the trains are great to ride on.\" </p> <p>As Graham Clark noted in his 1988 book The American City, LA is \"always hovering on the edge of significance\". But Mann reminds me of one of Vincent's speeches from the film, heavy with \"meaningless cosmos rhetoric\" - or, as Max describes it, \"Twilight Zone shit\". \"The lights of a million stars, millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars, in a speck on one in the blink of time ... that's us, lost in space, who knows, it's all fucking meaningless.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Collateral is released on September 17.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p> <b>TIME TO GET SERIOUS</b></p> <p>The day after the August bank holiday traditionally marks the end of the silly season and a return to serious news coverage, and the papers do their best to work up some enthusiasm for the end of summer. </p> <p>\"They're back!\" exclaims the Times. \"The misguided bill to ban foxhunting will be reintroduced in two weeks' time ... five-year plans from John Prescott's department, from environment ministers, and from the Department for Work and Pensions are imminent.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph worries about the advent of electronic NHS patient records, reporting that the National Audit Office is to investigate the GBP6.2bn project. Why? The paper doesn't seem to have much idea, but reminds its readers just how many big public sector IT projects have gone wrong or over budget in the past. \"Many [doctors] fear hackers could gain access to their records,\" it says.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the Telegraph, the venerable columnist WF Deedes weighs in with a rather moving article about his recent spell in an NHS hospital. WF, who is in his early nineties, has \"nothing but praise\" for his care. \"Every limb of my bed was wiped over with a damp cloth every day,\" he writes approvingly. The nurses were unfailingly kind, and the physiotherapists were even better. \"In some ways, it brought back recollections of soldiering in the second world war,\" he says.</p> <p>The NHS is also preoccupying the Times. Foundation hospitals complain to the paper that they enjoy less freedom and less money than they had been promised by the government. One hospital chief executive says that strategic health authorities are \"stifling\" him. </p> <p>The Guardian splashes with evidence that - contrary to previous assurances - ministers are importing nuclear waste and burying it in Britain. \"More than 10,000 cubic metres of foreign nuclear waste is buried at Drigg, in Cumbria, because it is too expensive to transport it back to the countries that produced it,\" says the paper.</p> <p>The FT notes that Iraq's oil exports have fallen to their lowest level for a year following persistent attacks on pumping stations and pipelines.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nuclear/article/0,2763,1293988,00.html\">Nuclear waste promises broken</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1240135,00.html\">Times: Hospital hold up</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/31/nhs31.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/08/31/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Inquiry as NHS patient records go online</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/13eaba18-fab9-11d8-9a71-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Attacks send Iraq oil exports to year low</a></p> <p><b>ARNIE STARS IN REPUBLICANS' SHOW</b></p> <p>For the broadsheets, however, there is still only one show worth travelling to: Arnold Schwarzenegger is topping the bill at Republican convention in New York tonight.</p> <p>\"George Bush arguably needs Mr Schwarzenegger more than the governor needs him,\" says the Guardian. \"He will bring an element of glamour ... Not only is he a successful immigrant, his state delegation will be considerably more diverse than the convention as a whole.\"</p> <p>The FT is more circumspect, pointing out that the governor of California has \"flip-flopped\" over the question of whether he would campaign for Mr Bush at all. He won't attack John Kerry, whom he has described as a \"terrific human being\". Nor is he likely to be able to turn California Republican. In short, the paper suggests, Mr Schwarzenegger can do more for the Republican party than he can offer Mr Bush.</p> <p>The Guardian toys with the notion that a third generation of the Bush dynasty will inherit the presidency. George P Bush, the 28-year-old nephew of W, son of Jeb and grandson of HW, is of Latino descent and could, the paper says, be a valuable asset in Florida.</p> <p>John McCain \"came out shooting for Bush\" yesterday, notes the Independent; Rudy Giuliani also spoke, and compared Mr Bush's \"war on terror\" with Ronald Reagan's leadership in the cold war and Winston Churchill's defiance of Hitler.</p> <p>The FT says the \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\", emboldened by the recent dip in Democrat support, intend to screen their anti-Kerry ads nationwide.</p> <p>\"If it is so blindingly obvious to the rest of the world that Bush is dumb, dangerous and the rest of it, how is it that millions of intelligent and perfectly decent people in the US see it so differently?\" wonders Martin Kettle in the Guardian, probing the big-government conservatism that has characterised Mr Bush's first term. \"We ought at least to do the millions of Bush voters the courtesy of trying to understand why.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1293981,00.html\">Meet the next George Bush</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1293929,00.html\">Arnie returns to lift the party faithful</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7c856e26-fadf-11d8-9a71-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Republicans salute Bush in convention opener</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/comment/story/0,14259,1294069,00.html\">Martin Kettle</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=556784\">Independent: McCain comes out shooting for Bush</a></p> <p><b>FRENCH HOSTAGES: DEADLINE EXTENDED</b></p> <p>The kidnappers holding two French journalists hostage in Iraq have given the men a 24-hour stay of execution, the Guardian reports.</p> <p>Footage broadcast on the al-Jazeera television station shows Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot repeating the kidnappers' demand that France repeal a law banning the wearing of Islamic headscarves in schools.</p> <p>\"The law will be applied,\" a spokesman for the French government said yesterday.

  "<p>Scottish universities have begun to create a single physics \"superdepartment\" to compete with the scientific might of Oxbridge and Imperial, in a move that could revolutionise the way research is organised.</p> <p>On Friday an international panel met to consider the merits of the project, which its advocates hope will pioneer a strategy of pooling the research resources of a small country to match the increasingly cut-throat competition for ratings and funding. The verdict has not been made public but the scientists involved are confident of getting the go-ahead.</p> <p>Chemistry departments across Scotland are already following this path, and similar moves for other subjects, such as economics and art and design, are under discussion.</p> <p>The Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (Supa) - which started in discussions between the department heads at St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow and now embraces Strathclyde, Heriot-Watt and Paisley - was born out of the realisation that these institutions do not have the critical mass to compete on their own at the very top level of research.</p> <p>But between them, the first three departments, all rated 5 in the 2001 research assessment exercise (RAE), had 132 research active physicists, more than Imperial (with 100) or University College London (84), and within sight of Cambridge (140), although the departments in England gained 5* ratings.</p> <p>The penalties for falling behind at the next RAE in 2008 will be severe: a haemorrhaging of funding and the loss of the best research staff to better-placed departments.</p> <p>A year ago, Scottish university heads were just beginning to come out of their shock at the prospect of losing out in the research race to the top English institutions. Not only are universities in England to charge tuition fees of up to \u00a33,000 a year - something the Scottish executive has set its face against - but the Westminister government's white paper on higher education recommended further concentration of funding on \"6*\" departments, potentially giving leading institutions the money to poach entire star research teams from north of the border. As well as the big four - Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and UCL - Manchester and Umist announced they were merging in a bid to join them as a research powerhouse.</p> <p>Further concentration of research is not an option in Scotland; in effect it would mean one institution, Edinburgh, getting the funds. But an alternative strategy of pooling resources began to emerge and has won the enthusiastic backing of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (Shefc) and politicians, as well as the universities.</p> <p>The funding council, which is assembling a \u00a320m package to get the show on the road, has set two tests: first, pooling must lead to better research and second, it must provide a more attractive environment for leading researchers.</p> <p>David Gani, director of research strategy at Shefc, says there is no single preferred model for pooling but hopes many of the methods developed in the physics and chemistry schemes can be adapted to other subjects. He is optimistic, but says there are difficult issues of management and autonomy universities must work through before large sums of money are committed.</p> <p>Chemistry departments have gone for a slightly different model, with the formation of EaStChem (Edinburgh and St Andrews) and WestChem (Glasgow and Strathclyde). They intend to make two joint submissions to the next RAE, and hope in time to coalesce as ScotChem.</p> <p>Professor Alan Miller, former head of physics at St Andrews and now vice-principal, says: \"For a small place like Scotland to compete, none of the departments has critical mass, although we have excellent physics. We felt we would benefit from working together.\"</p> <p>Miller is thinking about competing with Berkeley and MIT as much as Cambridge: \"We want to be recognised on a European scale and at least aspire to move towards the size and quality of some of the large US institutions.\"</p> <p>At the next RAE in 2008, the six universities have agreed to coordinate their research submissions - there isn't time for a single joint entry, says Miller. But five years ahead, \"the intention is that we will function as a single physics department effectively\".</p> <p>Five areas of Scottish strength have been identified: astronomy, condensed matter, particle physics, nuclear and plasma physics and photonics. A director and core staff, including a head of a graduate school, will be appointed and everyone involved hopes that Supa will attract star researchers.</p> <p>Any new appointments will raise delicate issues for the universities, however. They will employ the academics and fund their labs, but Supa will want an input into who is appointed and how each university fits into its overall strategy. On the plus side, it means Scottish universities will not be competing against each other for research stars, Miller points out.</p> <p>There is also a tension between a wish to be inclusive and the drive to select only the best research for the next RAE.</p> <p>Says Miller: \"There is a level at which we want to be totally inclusive: anybody doing physics-related research can be a member of Supa, including all postgraduates in Scotland. But a core membership of really top-rated people will drive this forward, the most distinguished physicists in Scotland. We want to make sure we are really working at an international level.\"</p> <p>Selecting that core will not be easy, he admits. \"There are quite a few things to work out. Pulling six departments together is a non-trivial thing to do.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On September 2 and 3 the Missenden Centre is holding a seminar in Dundee on research pooling.

  "<p><strong> Richard Williams</strong> </p> <p><strong> Best moment </strong> Nothing quite activates the emotions like a relay, and Britain's first victory in the Olympic 4x100m since 1912 was a blast of pure exhilaration, even if it owed quite a lot to the complacency of the US speedsters. </p> <p><strong> Worst moment </strong> The arrival of the news that some wretched Russian woman had tested positive after winning the shot put at ancient Olympia. </p> <p><strong> Star of the games</strong> Yelena Isinbayeva, who kept 25,000 people glued to their seats with a riveting and ultimately successful struggle against Svetlana Feofanova in the women's pole vault, then topped it off by producing a world record at 10 minutes past midnight. </p> <p><strong> One to watch out for in Beijing</strong> Mark Lewis-Francis, if he gets the message. And the whole Chinese team, whose medal total will break all records. </p> <p><strong> Best quote </strong> \"There's no one else I would have accepted being beaten by\". Barney Williams, stroke of Canada's coxless four, pays the ultimate tribute to his opposite number, Matthew Pinsent. </p> <p><strong> Strangest moment </strong> When it became apparent that the Athens air was not going to induce a fortnight-long battle against emphysema or endanger the lives of long-distance runners. Even in tacky old Omonia Square, it was like nectar. </p> <p><strong> Mark out of 10 for Athens</strong> 7. Everything worked, in an environment full of first-hand reminders of the culture that gave birth to the ancient games. Deductions for empty seats, the unsporting pro-Kederis demonstration, and too many bouzoukis. </p> <p> <strong> Duncan Mackay </strong></p> <p><strong> Best moment </strong> Mark Lewis-Francis holding off Maurice Greene to anchor Britain to victory in the 4x100m relay. It was one of those all-too-rare \"Oh my God, I don't believe that just happened\" moments in sport. Success could not have happened to a nicer group of athletes. </p> <p> <strong> Worst moment </strong> Paula Radcliffe lining up for the 10,000m only five days after dropping out of the marathon. She had bowed to public pressure when her advisers must have known that it was doomed to end in failure. They let her down badly. </p> <p> <strong> Star of the games </strong> Kelly Holmes would be an obvious choice but Hicham El Guerrouj for completing a 1500m-5,000m double not achieved since Finland's legendary Paavo Nurmi in 1924. It would have been a travesty if the Moroccan's career had ended without a gold medal. </p> <p> <strong> One to watch in Beijing </strong> Liu Xiang, who equalled Colin Jackson's 11-year-old 110m hurdles record of 12.91sec, is set to carry China's hopes when they stage the games. He does not fit the Chinese stereotype and may help to dispel the doubts that many have about the country's athletes, prompted by China's female distance runners. </p> <p> <strong> Best quote </strong> \"Our dogs are not trained to read. They are trained to find bombs.\" A spokesman for the Athens organisers after a reporter from a British Sunday tabloid newspaper had planted a series of false packages in the Olympic Stadium that said: \"Hello. I am a bomb.\" </p> <p> <strong> Strangest moment</strong> Being physically held back by Greek riot police while they allowed the former Olympic 200m champion Kostas Kederis to escape into the Hilton hotel after he had announced he had withdrawn from the Olympics. For a few moments I seriously feared for my safety as an irate colleague went toe to toe with an armed officer and informed him he was an animal. \"He's got a gun,\" I pointed out. </p> <p> <strong> Mark out of 10 for Athens</strong> 8. For four years the Greek capital has had to live with everyone's doubts about whether it could pull it off and about security fears. The city's citizens will be paying for it for years but at least they can look the world in the eye and say they did not let anyone down. </p> <p> <strong> Stephen Bierley </strong></p> <p><strong> Best moment </strong> Georgina Harland's bronze in the modern pentathlon when she came back from 14th place at the start of the 3,000m. \"It's never too much, it's the Olympics.\" </p> <p> <strong> Worst moment </strong> The unseemly ganging up by the Brits, French and the US in the three-day eventing to rob the German team and Bettina Hoy of their gold medals. This should not be what the Court of Arbitration for Sport in used for. </p> <p> <strong> Star of the games </strong> Hicham El Guerrouj, who won one of the best 1500m of all time and then so spectacularly doubled up in the 5,000. </p> <p> <strong> One to watch in Beijing </strong> Sarah Ayton, gold medal in the Yngling, and Nick Dempsey, bronze on the sailboard. Getting married soon and perhaps the chance of a love boat together in China if mixed sailing is allowed. </p> <p> <strong> Best quote </strong> \"He was behaving like an emu. He had his head up so far he couldn't see his feet.\" Kate Allenby, on her horse in the modern pentathlon that ended her medal chances. </p> <p> <strong> Strangest moment </strong> Justin Gatlin gently sticking a finger into Shawn Crawford's ear as they prepared for the 100m final. </p> <p> <strong> Mark out of 10 for Athens</strong> Much better than Atlanta but nowhere as good as Sydney or Barcelona. A modest 6. </p> <p> <strong> Paul Kelso </strong></p> <p><strong> Best moment </strong> It was going to take something extraordinary to exceed Matthew Pinsent's fourth title, Ian Thorpe's awesome 200m freestyle win and Hicham El Guerrouj's 1500 and 5,000m golden double, but the British 4x100m squad provided it. The look on Maurice Greene's face as Mark Lewis-Francis whooped in victory was enjoyed far beyond the UK. </p> <p> <strong> Worst moment</strong> The attack on the marathon leader Vanderlei Lima, which in all probability cost the Brazilian a gold medal. Athens' security had been impressively effective until that point. That its greatest lapse affected the medals in the games' most evocative event was a minor tragedy. </p> <p> <strong> Star of the games</strong> Hicham El Guerrouj. The greatest middle-distance runner of his generation arrived in Athens with nothing to prove but his reaction to double gold proved that Olympic medals still matter more than any record. </p> <p> <strong> One to watch in Beijing</strong> Aside from the entire Chinese team, who will be fearsomely strong come 2008, how about hoping Dean Macey remains injury-free and becomes the 9,000-point decathlete his talent promises? </p> <p> <strong> Strangest moment</strong> Developing a sudden interest in synchronised diving was odd. Being constantly followed by the surveillance blimps that circled Athens was odder. I don't want to sound paranoid, but they really were following me. </p> <p> <strong> Best quote</strong> \"Tell Michael Johnson he's a wanker.\" Darren Campbell's request after the heats of the 200m sounded like sour grapes, but who's laughing now? </p> <p> <strong> Mark out of 10 for Athens</strong> 7. The stadiums were ready, the transport network worked, the security was unobtrusive - too unobtrusive at the marathon - and the athletes did their bit, but where were the crowds? </p> <p> <strong> Lawrence Donegan </strong></p> <p><strong> Best moment</strong> </p> <p> George W Bush jumps on the Iraqi football team bandwagon, proclaiming their wins as victories for his crazy war. Iraqi team then throws Dubya under the bandwagon wheels, calling him a mass murderer. A gold medal performance. </p> <p> <strong> Worst moment</strong> </p> <p> The efforts of the US basketball team. Half-hearted and surly (LeBron James excepted). A troupe of overpaid show ponies finally revealed as the new Harlem Globetrotters. </p> <p> <strong> Star of the games</strong> No apologies for a parochial choice. It has to be Amir Khan - a great boxer, and a great advert for Britain's multicultural future. </p> <p> <strong> One to watch in Beijing</strong> Yao Ming carried the Chinese flag at these games, not to mention a young Chinese team in the basketball tournament. Next time round, his team-mates will be ready and Yao - the most popular athlete in China, and probably the world - will be an iconic figure. He's a funny guy, too. </p> <p> <strong> Best quote</strong> \"I am going home to bury my toe.\" American wrestler Rulon Gardner, who lost a toe to frostbite but kept it in his fridge for inspiration, discussing his post-Olympic plans. </p> <p> <strong> Strangest moment</strong> Greek newspaper Kathimerini excuses the Greek crowd's booing of the 200m: \"Mediterranean people live under the sun and are intrigued by the mysterious ...\" No mystery here. Their man got caught cheating and they didn't like it. </p> <p> <strong> Mark out of 10 for Athens</strong> 6. Beautiful city, magnificent sports but - I hate to say it - Athens is too small and too inward-looking to host an Olympic Games. </p> <p> <strong> William Fotheringham </strong></p> <p><strong> Best moment</strong> Bradley Wiggins and Rob Hayles taking bronze in the madison. \"Only\" a bronze, but achieved in the face of adversity and it made Wiggins the first Briton to take three medals in one games in 40 years. </p> <p> <strong> Worst moment</strong> Paula Radcliffe abandoning in the 10,000m. Worse than her disappointment in the marathon because of the feeling that it was virtually inevitable and she was merely prolonging the agony. </p> <p> <strong> Star of the games</strong> Kelly Holmes - if you have your patriotic hat on, no one comes close. </p> <p> <strong> One to watch in Beijing</strong> On two wheels, and with my blinkered parochial hat on, Ross Edgar, who came from nowhere to take fifth in the men's sprint at only 21. </p> <p> <strong> Best quote</strong> \"After the crucifixion comes the resurrection.\" Kostas Kederis. Eat your heart out Eric Cantona. </p> <p> <strong> Strangest moment</strong> That motorcycle crash. For students of bizarre drug episodes, it tops all those excuses about nandrolone in toothpaste and sex and beer boosting testosterone to unnatural levels. </p> <p> <strong> Mark out of 10 for Athens</strong> 8. Great main complex, fine transport, perfect weather, wonderful volunteers, but a bizarre lack of Olympic atmosphere in the city centre. It looked as if, in the rush to get everything finished, that side was ignored. </p> <p> <strong> David Hopps</strong> </p> <p><strong> Best moment</strong> Irini Merleni's hair-tugging, sobbing celebration after she became the first woman to win an Olympics wrestling gold. The Ukrainian ended with a leap into the arms of an astonished referee and a passionate kiss for all the judges. Her delight brought a tear to the eye. </p> <p> <strong> Worst moment</strong> The lax international security that allowed Cornelius Horan, the former Roman Catholic priest, to invade the marathon course. This crazed Irishman was a known security risk, with previous at Silverstone and the London marathon. Why was he allowed to travel? </p> <p> <strong> Star of the games</strong> Michael Phelps (US swimmer). Eight medals (six gold), equalling the record of the Russian gymnast Aleksandr Dityatin, should make Phelps an automatic pick, although there was a bit too much American bombast along the way. </p> <p> <strong> One to watch in Beijing</strong> James Goddard (British backstroker). </p> <p> <strong> Best quote</strong> \"We like to play cards.\" Iraqis in the bar opposite the Guardian's Athens hotel, explaining why they entirely ignored the Olympics on the big screen - especially the Greek golds. </p> <p> <strong> Strangest moment</strong> The time I ended up in airport departures looking for the showjumping. </p> <p> <strong> Overall mark</strong> 7. Athens worked better than expected. It was relaxed and inviting, a city on the up. But it lacked Sydney's all-consuming delight, largely because the Greeks were interested only in their own.</p>",
