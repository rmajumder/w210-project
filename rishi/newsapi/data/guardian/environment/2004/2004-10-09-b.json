  "<p>This is World Cup week, when club football takes a break and international football takes over. But scattered around Europe, while their compatriots are sweating and fretting over the latest bout of qualifying matches for Germany 2006, aworryingly large number of elite footballers will spend the time with their feet up and their minds at rest.</p> <p>After the summer's European Championship finals, a number of global superstars quit their national teams prematurely. It is not as though they can no longer cut it on the big stage: you can still catch former France captain Zinedine Zidane caressing the ball for Real Madrid. Pavel Nedved, one-time playmaker for the Czech Republic, is bewildering defences for Juventus. And erstwhile England puller of strings Paul Scholes remains a key instigator for Manchester United. </p> <p>These are players who are fit and gifted enough to perform at the arguably higher level of the Champions League, but they feel finished with the international game. It just does not do it for them any more.</p> <p>The honour of representing your country is being eroded by the realities of modern football - particularly for players approaching the end of their career. They have served their time, had a crack at a few tournaments. They believe that they can bow out gracefully, without feeling that they are letting anyone down. It still takes some getting used to, though, this idea that a player can choose not to do something that was always supposed to be every boy's dream.</p> <p>One Premiership regular with a host of caps explained that it was all too much aggravation. 'I want my summer with the family,' he said. 'I enjoy not having to travel several times during the season for qualification games. I feel fresher playing for my club and in the long term it means I might able to earn a good contract for a year or two more than if I carried on with the national team.'</p> <p>Other positives for the retirees: no more animosity from fans or abuse from media who expect nothing but the best to honour the nation. Then there is the boredom of being stuck in hotels, the exhausting flights, sometimes to places that would hardly be top of their dream holiday list.</p> <p>Fifa ought to be concerned that international football is becoming a question of choice. A seasoned professional now asks himself: Do I need this? It was shocking to hear Thierry Henry say recently that he had considered abandoning the France team after their latest disappointing tournament. He is arguably the best player in the world and, at 27, is on the cusp of what could be a five-year peak period.</p> <p>It is a bitter experience for players who were part of the all-conquering France team of 1998-2000 to cope with being losers. It is no coincidence that the older generation, who doubt their effectiveness come their mid-thirties at the 2006 World Cup, called it a day last summer. Long gone, alas, is the spirit of Roger Milla, who danced his merry way through the 1990 World Cup finals at the ripe old age of 40. That is 11 years older than Scholes when he decided to make himself unavailable to England.</p> <p>Maybe it is Greece's fault. Maybe players such as Zidane, Nedved and Luis Figo - whose bewilderment at the success of Otto Rehhagel's team at the expense of more technically gifted opponents in Portugal was all too tangible - felt that their way was not working any more. These three examples of the recently retired have the added pressure of being their country's designated flag-bearer. The mental and physical stress did for them.</p> <p>'My state of health is not good enough to withstand the tremendous physical load,' said Nedved when he stepped down from the Czech Republic team at 32. All in all, he felt too washed-up to manage the full complement of Serie A , Champions League and international matches, and who can blame him?</p> <p>Here we are, in October, with the season in its relative infancy and we are into the third international break. For players who have endured a long summer tournament at the end of a draining club campaign, qualifying rounds for the next tournament come so thick and fast that they are justified in feeling concerned about burnout.</p> <p>If something has to give way to remedy the damage of overplaying, it is not difficult to spot the odd one out between domestic football, European competition and the international game. It is the one not linked to the salary.</p> <p>While Fifa's busy calendar is partly responsible for this trend, it is also necessary to point the finger at the bloated wages. If longevity of career can be harmed by too much football, and if retiring from international competition prolongs a club career by, say, two years at \u00a360,000 a week, it is no wonder so many players are turning their back on the country's national team.</p> <p>In some cases, such a decision is understandable. Take the example of Dejan Stafanovic (formerly of Serbia and Montenegro and still of Portsmouth) or Shaun Bartlett (formerly of South Africa and still of Charlton Athletic). They have no compunction about maximising their earnings while they can, to guarantee a comfortable future for their families. They are not on the same wage scale as the superstars and another season or so in milking the Premiership cow makes a massive difference.</p> <p>But in the end, whether it is Serbia or France, South Africa or Holland, it is a sad reflection on international football that more players just say no. The best used to retire because of injury or because they fell out with the manager. If they continue to make themselves unavailable, international competition will become devalued.</p> <p>Claude Makelele, who will be 33 by the time the next World Cup in Germany comes around, nobly explained that his motives for quitting were to give the youngsters their chance. 'It's time to give way to the young generation of players. They need experience before the next World Cup.' Well actually, Claude, they just need to qualify for the next World Cup first and foremost.</p> <p>Thankfully, the Rooney factor remains sacrosanct. Young players will always be desperate for every cap and fired by tremendous motivation to prove their worth on a new level. But will the sheer joy and the boundless energy last for ever, even for a superhero like Wayne?</p> <p><strong>The 'I quit' XI</strong></p> <p><strong>Francesco Toldo</strong> (Inter Milan, ex-Italy) </p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 32 </p> <p>'I think it is only right that I step aside and allow room for the new generation. Italy are in safe hands. I had already decided to retire before Euro 2004, but I didn't want to announce it then.' </p> <p><strong>Lilian Thuram</strong> (Juventus, ex-France) </p> <p><strong>Age: </strong> 32 </p> <p>'I have already given as much as I can for France. In two years' time, maybe some players will be performing better than me. It's time they get ready. It's the end of Thuram's cycle.' </p> <p><strong>Jaap Stam</strong> (AC Milan, ex-Holland) </p> <p><strong> Age:</strong> 32 </p> <p>'With AC Milan I will already be away from home a lot and I have a family to consider as well as my career. Holland must look forwards, not back.' </p> <p><strong>Dejan Stefanovic</strong> (Portsmouth, ex-Serbia) </p> <p><strong>Age: </strong> 29 </p> <p>'I want my club to come first. There was a lot of travelling involved and it was sometimes taking days to get to and from matches. I did not enjoy that.' </p> <p><strong>Luis Figo</strong> (Real Madrid, ex-Portugal) </p> <p><strong>Age: </strong> 31 </p> <p>'I think the time has come to take a break. I feel the need to stop. There are moments in life when we are forced to make choices. This one is particularly difficult for me.' </p> <p><strong>Zinedine Zidane</strong> (Real Madrid, ex-France) </p> <p><strong>Age: </strong> 32 </p> <p>'It's important to know when your time has come. My decision is going to give me more time to focus on my job with Madrid. I will also have more time to rest throughout the season.' </p> <p><strong>Claude Makelele</strong> (Chelsea, ex-France) </p> <p><strong>Age: </strong> 31 </p> <p>'I shall be 33 in 2006. It's time to give way to the young generation of players like Benoit and Pedretti. They need experience before the next World Cup.' </p> <p><strong> Pavel Nedved</strong> (Juventus, ex-Czech Republic) </p> <p><strong>Age: </strong> 32 </p> <p>'My state of health is not good enough to withstand the tremendous physical load. The injuries I have accumulated recently take much longer to heal than for a younger player.' </p> <p><strong>Manuel Rui Costa</strong> (AC Milan, ex-Portugal) </p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 32 </p> <p>'The reasons behind my decision are not important. I already feel nostalgia for this side just thinking about this. The handing over of power to the next generation is almost complete.' </p> <p><strong>Paul Scholes</strong> (Manchester United, ex-England) </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 29 </p> <p>'This is a decision I have not taken lightly. Euro 2004 was fantastic but afterwards I felt the time was right for myself and my family to make it my last England appearance.' </p> <p><strong>Alan Shearer</strong> (Newcastle United, ex-England) </p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 34 </p> <p>'I honestly believe my remaining football ambitions can be fulfilled with Newcastle United in the Premiership and in the Champions League.' </p> <p><strong>Manager: Kevin Keegan</strong> (Manchester City, ex-England) </p> <p><strong> Age</strong> : 53 </p> <p>'I told the players that is me finished. I feel I fall short of what is required for this job.

  "<p>Americans have a saying in business that if you are going to sell your soul, do it at the height of the market. The trick is knowing when the market has reached that point. Has English domestic football peaked?</p> <p>The game has been selling its soul by the pound for more than a decade now since the arrival of the Premiership, on the back of television money that has altered its landscape. Kick-off times all over the show, stadiums named after airlines. Anyone nostalgic for an evocative old movie called 'The Emirates Stadium Mystery'?</p> <p>The benefits of the boom have been many. More comfortable environments (thanks also to Lord Justice Taylor, rather than just BSkyB); top-quality players, who would not otherwise have come to what were perceived by the best European players as savage shores.</p> <p>Now there are signs of disenchantment, however. The Premiership has become too predictable. The top three are pulling farther and farther away through purchasing power. For former big clubs such as Tottenham and Everton, the summit is a Uefa Cup place, possibly that fourth place and the Champions League if lucky. Fourth place, for goodness sake.</p> <p>We may even be starting to pine for the three tiers of the Premiership, as four are now developing. With the fissure between the top level and the Second Division - make that First Division, make that Championship - now a chasm, it has become virtually a closed shop, the three promoted clubs more likely to go down than stay up. Those who have managed to hang around, such as Charlton and Birmingham, are already streets ahead of Norwich, West Brom and Crystal Palace.</p> <p>This season, attendances are down, along with the number of goals per game. Fans being turned off by the sordid off-field behaviour of some too-much-too-young players is one thing, but when the entertainment value - the uncertainty of outcome - dips as prices increase, it becomes altogether more worrying.</p> <p>We are in annual accounts and AGM season. On Friday, Newcastle announced pre-tax profits down by almost 25 per cent, largely as a result of not qualifying for the Champions League proper. After tax, there will be a loss. This for a club who regularly play to crowds of 50,000, all of whom seem to be wearing a costly black-and-white striped shirt.</p> <p>Even Manchester United, the world's most profitable club, saw profits fall from \u00a339.3million to \u00a327.9m. So why is Malcolm Glazer so keen to buy United?</p> <p>Call me suspicious - along with many United followers, shareholders and demonstrators at reserve team games - but I am not sure Mr Glazer simply loves 'sarker'. Nor am I convinced that he just wants a business for his son Joel, who is apparently a fan, to run.</p> <p>It may well be that the game in England has peaked. It may well also be, however, that the English club game around the world has not. Chelsea do not think so. It went almost unnoticed last week that they have signed a marketing deal in the United States with the William Morris Agency, who also look after the NFL.</p> <p>As my colleague Denis Campbell points out elsewhere, new trends are emerging as a result of new technology. The New York Yankees, with whom Manchester United have links, are similarly high profile across a nation. They already sell their own TV rights and keep the money, but how long will it be before they seek to withdraw from baseball's collective selling of internet broadcast rights, from which they receive only one thirtieth of the revenue at present. The potential for revenue going directly to the club is enormous.</p> <p>You can bet Sky are worried and working on the future at this very moment. You can also wager that top English clubs will be pondering individual rather than collective deals when the next round of talks is held. Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers gridiron franchise and who tried to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers - the West Coast equivalent of the Yankees - will know all about this. Along with internet opportunities for betting and the selling of merchandise.</p> <p>America remains a market ripe for football of a high quality, as the attendances and coverage of the 1994 World Cup illustrated. Major League Soccer has never taken advantage of that impetus and attendances are distinctly ordinary, largely because of the absence of big names and quality players.</p> <p>Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have them. So do Real Madrid and Barcelona, Milan and Juventus, Bayern Munich, too. There is still development left in the Champions League, with the G14 clubs eyeing a proper European League. There could even be a World League, once the great clubs of South America have had a bit of money and marketing thrown at them.</p> <p>Why stop there? Milton Keynes is but a small step for man. Let's plonk a franchise down in Sydney, Johannesburg, NYC and LA. And Beijing. After all, those mobilising Chinese capitalists will pay money to watch Li Tie warming up as an Everton substitute.</p> <p>There's gold in them thar balls. I suppose, being a sucker of a fan - which is what they all bank on - I will subscribe and watch New York Kicks v Manchester United when my TV and computer are one and the same.</p> <p>Those left behind may form a Premiership that is more closely contested. We may even see Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea fielding reserve teams domestically while their elite jet off. What Mr Glazer and his ilk should never underestimate amid their global strategy, though, is the desire of domestic audiences to see United play City, Real play Atl\u00e9tico and Milan take on Inter at least twice a season. Who can say where it will all lead? Who could say that the Premiership would be what it is when the game was on its knees in the dark 1980s days of the Heysel, Bradford, and Hillsborough? Doomsday may not be not far away according to some: but then it never has been. And football does have a curious knack of pulling back from the brink and saving itself.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago English football was a different game. Fans could pay at the gate, grounds were often only two-thirds full, average attendance was 26,000 and not every Premiership stadium was all-seat. Sky Sports showed 40 live matches per season, and only on Sunday afternoons and Monday nights.</p> <p>Fast-forward a decade. You must buy your ticket in advance, the average crowd is over 35,000, and across the season's 380 Premier League games, grounds are 95 per cent full. This season Sky will screen 138 fixtures live and there are three different kick-off times on Saturdays alone. The top players earn \u00a380,000 to \u00a3100,000 a week: that would have been several months wages to most Premier League footballers in 1994.</p> <p>There have been similarly radical changes in the communications industry. Britain's 60 million citizens own 56.2m mobile phones; in 1994 it was just a few million. A decade ago few Britons had even heard of text messages; last year we sent 20.5 billion of them. Sky had 3.6m subscribers, fewer than half the number in 2004. And back then the world somehow coped without the as-yet-uninvented joys of photo-messaging, video-phones and Freeview set-top boxes.</p> <p>It is in this context of dramatic change in football, lifestyle and technology that Malcolm Glazer's bid to buy Manchester United makes sense, especially given the similarly dizzying upheaval still to come in those areas. When the takeover approach was confirmed last week, most business analysts were sceptical. How, they asked, could the 76-year-old American hope to make a serious profit on an investment of about \u00a3800m? Nobody seemed to know.</p> <p>The answer lies in what football and telecommunications might be like in 2014. If the changes over the next 10 years are as significant as they have been since 1994, Glazer's move might make him a fortune. The booming popularity of broadband internet - which lets fans watch TV-quality pictures on a personal computer, and allows every club to act as its own TV station - is the key. </p> <p>Privately, many United insiders are sceptical about Glazer's chances of making even bigger profits. 'How do you sweat what is probably football's dampest asset?' asked one. 'How would you do that except in the ways United are already doing it?' Understandably, the sceptics point to United's status as the world's most profitable football club. Their annual profits may have dropped from \u00a339.35m to \u00a327.91m last year because of their relatively poor performance in both the Premiership and Champions League, but that \u00a327.91m is still far more than any English or top European club made.</p> <p>It is no coincidence, however, that both Glazer and the Cubic Expression duo of John Magnier and JP McManus - the Irish investors who own 29 per cent of United, and whose stake Glazer wants to buy, to add to his own 19 per cent holding - see Old Trafford as a superb commercial asset that, in City parlance, is significantly under-exploited. Inevitably, perhaps, for characters who are businessmen first and lovers of sport second, the trio believe that United are in effect a slot-machine that in different hands could and should deliver bigger jackpots.</p> <p>'Malcolm Glazer and his sons want to own United for a number of reasons,' explains one source close to the American's plans. 'They are genuinely interested in sport; they think they could bring stability to the club; they have very smart marketing skills; they want to make the team even stronger and more successful football-wise, to make it unrivalled; and, yes, they want to make it more successful off the pitch too.'</p> <p>That last reason is the most important. There are plenty of ways in which United under the Glazer family's control could quickly start making even more money. Jacking up ticket prices, while unpopular, would scarcely affect United's drawing power: they were the only Premier League club to record 25 sell-outs from 25 home games last season. More of Old Trafford's 67,900 seats could be sold to corporate visitors willing to pay \u00a3100 or more a time, or many of the extra 7,700 new places that will be installed as part of Old Trafford's planned expansion could become 'executive' seats.</p> <p>Selling the stadium naming rights, as Arsenal have just done for their new home, would be easily the biggest money-spinner of that sort in football history. If the airline is prepared to pay \u00a340m-\u00a360m over 15 years to have the Gunners' new home called The Emirates Stadium, how much would Nike or Coca-Cola stump up to have Old Trafford renamed? Gambling would also provide a lucrative new revenue stream. Some football finance analysts believe United could use their worldwide popularity and their manutd.com website to become, in effect, an online global bookie. Their existing arrangement to have Ladbrokes as their 'official gaming partner' has only skimmed the surface of the huge potential there. United's best opportunity to make huge profits, though, is to get control of their own broadcasting rights and then use the ongoing revolution in broadband internet access to fully exploit the club's global popularity by persuading fans to pay to watch Wayne Rooney, Ruud van Nistelrooy and the rest live on a United website.</p> <p>The resulting revenue could reach \u00a3100m a year or more, and would destroy the competitiveness of not just the Premier league but the Champions League too - unless, of course, other super-clubs were doing the same. For United, broadband offers the chance to create a massive worldwide network of fans who pay a monthly or annual subscription to watch action from Old Trafford on personal computers or computer-fed TV including, crucially, live Premiership games. And if they can pull off that trick, then Liverpool, Juventus, Real Madrid and other clubs will quickly follow. Initially TV cameras will provide the pictures seen by broadband, but ultimately broadband could replace television altogether. Technological advances will soon end the inferior quality of pictures seen on the internet compared with TV. </p> <p>'If Malcolm Glazer got control of United and put exclusive club content on broadband, he could charge people to watch goals, highlights, archive games, player interviews, training sessions and, if things changed in the future, live Premier League games. Any club with a decent following abroad could monetise those people that way,' explains Dan Markham of Octagon, the sports marketing group.</p> <p>Broadband is spreading fast; very fast. While only some 100m people worldwide will have access to it by the end of 2004, numbers are going up rapidly in Asia, North America and parts of Europe. Only 3.2m households in the UK have it now, but that is predicted to rise to 5m by next year. The stunning growth in recent years of what were once niche markets - multi-channel TV, text messaging, even mobile phones - shows the potential rewards for any sports club or league who can 'monetise' by broadband.</p> <p>'Being American, and given the fact that America already has 30m homes with broadband, Glazer could start a United subscription broadband service there first,' says Markham. 'You have a potential market of tens of millions there and United are already a powerful brand there.' They could then seek to repeat the trick in China, Japan and beyond. Kevin Roberts, editorial direc tor of Sport Business , says: 'United are one of the few clubs that have the global fan base you need to make this a serious business proposition. Once broadband really takes off, United could cash in on their status as the only truly established international superbrand in English football and eventually make maybe \u00a32m or \u00a33m per match, adding perhaps as much as \u00a370m a season to their income.' </p> <p>What will happen if Europe's superclubs succeed in this? The trouble, as Markham and Roberts point out, is that their domestic leagues will become even more uncompetitive. And the on-off idea of creating a European Super League, if not a global league, could finally be realised. If all this sounds fanciful, consider that in America, one million baseball fans now pay $2.95 a day, $14.95 a month or $80 a season to watch up to 15 Major League Baseball matches live every day on a broadband website. Last year it was 500,000. During Euro 2004, fans wanting to see 10-minute highlight packages of games from Portugal soon after the final whistle paid \u20ac14.99 to do just that on the euro2004.com action broadband service. The site had more than two million visits during the tournament, but Uefa will not reveal how many people subscribed.</p> <p>In England, most of the 20 Premier League clubs operate a subscription-based broadband internet service where fans can, for a small fee, watch highlights, interviews and behind-the-scenes material. Between them they have about 100,000 subscribers worldwide. Since 2003 Sky Sports have been offering subscribers in the UK and Ireland highlights of events such as the Champions League, Ryder Cup and Premier League via broadband.</p> <p>'I can't tell you how many subscribers we have except that it's growing rapidly, but off a low base,' says Steve Nuttall, head of enterprises at Sky Sports.</p> <p>In all these ventures, what industry experts call 'displaced fans' - a Liverpool supporter living in Thailand, a New York Yankees follower on a trip to Seattle, an English cricket enthusiast on work placement in Australia - are the main target. While home-based fans can usually see what they want through domestic television, those outside the country often cannot. But thanks to the rapid globalisation of football, there are more and more 'displaced fans'. A recent survey by sports sponsorship agency Sport + Markt calculated that Real Madrid had 490m fans or potential fans around the world, with United second on 350m. Turning those fans into subscribers to a dedicated club broadband service could generate vast wealth. </p> <p>Nobody pretends that webcasting - offering live sporting action or highlights via broadband internet - is yet a serious money-spinner. But then, who in 1994 would have predicted games kicking off at lunchtime, 3pm and teatime on Saturdays? And who in 1991-92 really believed that the then Big Five clubs would dare to break away and form their own league, the Premier League? </p> <p>The problem for United in seeking to go down this road, whoever owns the club, is that the Premier League control their, and the other 19 clubs', broadcasting rights. In Italy and Spain, clubs sell their rights individually; here the league does it collectively. 'The only rights which United control are those to friendlies, testimonials, tours, Uefa Cup games and matches they play in the final qualifying round of the Champions League. The value of those is nothing compared to being able to show live Premiership games, which is where they could make really serious money,' stresses Roberts.</p> <p>While the 20 clubs have taken back more and more rights to exploit themselves with each new Sky contract, they can still show only highlights or full-match delayed reruns, not live games. When the Premier League chairmen sit down in 2006 to discuss the shape of the deal that will start in August 2007, Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, Liverpool - with a significant fan base in Asia - and Arsenal could all join United in seeking that concession, if not more.</p> <p>United have long been frus trated at earning far less from the Premier League's collective TV deals at home and abroad than they arguably deserve, given the large number of viewers they deliver. Last season, for instance, the League distributed to its 20 clubs \u00a3457.7m from the domestic broadcasting contract with Sky, of which United got \u00a331.3m, or 6.8 per cent. It was the same with the share-out of the \u00a365m from foreign television companies. United, despite being English football's undisputed big attraction, got the same \u00a32.83m as the other 19 clubs. Yet they provide, by common agreement, at least 25 per cent of all fans who tune in.</p> <p>This is why their former chairman, Sir Roland Smith, once suggested that the Premier League should let United sell their own TV rights and then pay a 'tax' on the resulting income as compensation to the other 19. Nothing changed. And when the new three-year broadcasting contracts were being discussed by the clubs early last year, Peter Kenyon, then still United's chief executive, again tried to get United more money. He requested the introduction of a 'weighting system' for the distribution of revenue generated from selling live Premier League games abroad, with payments linked to popularity. Unsurprisingly, the club chairmen rejected the proposal 19-1. If the Glazers get control of Old Trafford, United are unlikely to accept the rejection of such demands.</p> <p>The defining trends of European football in the past decade have been globalisation, commercialisation, broadcasting and elitism. Harnessing the worldwide popularity of football's lucky few clubs through broadband technology draws all those together perfectly.</p> <p>The Glazers know that, even if most others don't yet.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Its looking like a group of long, drawn-out death already. Who in their right minds would pick a winner - or even a runner-up - for this intensely close slog for a World Cup prize in two years' time. Three games in and as we stand four nations (Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland, France, Israel) are locked together on five points.</p> <p>Ireland earned a well-deserved draw and heaped discomfort on a France side who look increasingly unhappy under the current regime.</p> <p>There was no underestimating the significance of this fixture between two sides who fancy themselves for automatic qualification as Group 4 winners. Although it was as well that the Irish were in town, as otherwise there would have been no clue of a sellout international in Paris. During the afternoon the only people demonstrating their faith on the banks of the Seine who were not wearing green were Hare Krishnas. Once inside the stadium, the estimated 30,000 Irish leant volume to the home team's national anthem by jigging and la-la-la-ing through the Marseillais. Extraordinary. No mistaking whose veins were coursing with optimism.</p> <p>France desperately needed a boost to stop the current mood of disillusionment becoming too entrenched. L'Equipe 's banner headline had warned that this was 'the moment of truth'. Raymond Domenech's brief reign has been so heavily undermined by player unrest, disappointing form and media bullets that his position is said, by some, to depend upon this set of games (they take on Cyprus, in Nicosia, on Wednesday night).</p> <p>It was a huge test of the inexperience evident in the heart of the team: the central defensive partnership of Sebastien Squillaci and Ga\u00ebl Givet took the field with six caps between them, while in front of them Rio Antonio Mavuba, an Angolan famously born on a refugee boat off the African coast, started for the first time in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira.</p> <p>With the midfield battleground obviously up for grabs, Brian Kerr plumped for Kevin Kilbane's energy to dovetail with the old warrior Roy Keane. The ex-captain seized the initiative from the off with a delicious through-ball to Clinton Morrison, who couldn't quite react quickly enough to test Fabien Barthez. A golden chance.</p> <p>Half-chances came fairly regularly - Steve Finnan cut inside and shot straight at Barthez, Morrison squirted a header wide, Robbie Keane and Damien Duff were blocked in the same move. Ireland were in their element, determined to show confidence and aggression before France could find any kind of groove. Just who was at home here?</p> <p>Robert Pires made himself the visiting public's enemy numero un when he went down easily to win a free-kick a yard outside the penalty area and was consistently jeered afterwards. France looked rudderless for the first half-hour - no evidence that they were gelling more as a team (either technically or spiritually) under Domenech's idiosyncratic stewardship. But with half-time approaching they began to exert some pressure, as William Gallas and Pires tested Given with awkward shots.</p> <p>Gallas, pushing up whenever possible, found considerable space to attack. Consequently limiting his Chelsea colleague, Damien Duff, who was forced to track back more often than Ireland would have liked. Attacking options were shifted slightly more five minutes before half-time when their main aerial threat, Clinton Morrison, shuffled off injured. </p> <p>His replacement, Andy Reid, whipped a shot that Barthez fumbled shortly after half-time, but Robbie Keane couldn't reach the loose ball. France, sensing the gravity of the situation, responded and should have taken the lead when Pires found Gallas from a free-kick, only for the defender to scuff it. Then Djibril Ciss\u00e9 saw a firm shot blocked.</p> <p>Back came Ireland, Duff volleying from a pinballed corner to lift the Irish spirits. The game was tensing up, tight as a snare drum, with both teams aware of how critical this tussle could be come the final group reckoning.</p> <p>France, requiring experience and nerve, could have done without Olivier Dacourt limping out and giving way for a debutant replacement in Alou Diarra. (How good did Claude Makelele and Zinedine Zidane, who retired from the international scene in the summer, feel watching on at home?) They could also have done without Barthez clowning around inside his box just when they needed calm heads.</p> <p>Ireland smelled blood. Keane glanced a header at Barthez and then John O'Shea was oh-so-close, steering a volley fractionally wide of the far post from Reid's free-kick.</p> <p>Given was more heroic at the other end, stretching to paw away a rare chance for Thierry Henry.

  "<p>The German newspaper group Axel Springer is in talks with Time Out founder Tony Elliot about launching a French-language edition of the magazine in Paris. If the joint ventures goes ahead it could lead to further cooperation between the two groups. </p> <p> Time Out publishes the eponymous London guide and a successful New York sister title, and Elliot is planning further US editions. The magazine is also printed under licence in several other cities. The company prints a Paris Time Out in English and has an office in the French capital, but a French-language equivalent would be the first in a foreign tongue.</p> <p> Time Out is privately owned and Elliot has held talks with several venture capital groups with a view to selling a 15-20 per cent stake in the company but has not found a suitable partner. He would like to secure outside investment to speed up the group's global expansion, but is reluctant to surrender control of the company he founded over 25 years ago. </p> <p>Axel Springer's chairman and chief executive, Mathias Dopfner, wants to acquire assets outside the group's home market. The group, whose titles include broadsheet Die Welt and tabloid Bild, dominates the German newspaper industry and further expansion there is likely to be blocked by the competition authorities.</p> <p>Axel Springer made an unsuccessful bid for the Daily Telegraph and its Sunday sister title earlier this year.</p>",
  "<p>Young people don't read newspapers, - or at least that's what everyone thinks. They go out to pubs, clubs, and to hang out with their friends. That's when they are not glued to their televisions, Playstations and the internet. </p> <p>Young people are talking to each other constantly - about pop stars, footballers, celebrities, TV shows, music, sex, cars, health: what's cool, what's in and what's out. </p> <p>But to do all that talking, young people need 'social fuel' - a bottomless well of information and opinions. And guess what: they get it - at least in part - from newspapers. Newspapers are the fuel injection systems for the social lives of today's young adults.</p> <p>Research just carried out by RDSI and BMRB for the Newspaper Marketing Agency shows that, in the 16-24 age group, 45 per cent (3.2 million) read a daily newspaper and 77 per cent (5.6 million) read a newspaper each week. </p> <p>While overall readership numbers have declined, that simply reflects a fragmentation that has affected all the media. It is worse for broadcasting: where once the TV audience had three channels to choose from, it is now scattered over several hundred. The picture for radio is similar. </p> <p>The newspaper is the last bastion of mass delivery for a young adult audience. It is the only medium that deliv ers a mass youth market day in, day out. </p> <p>Every issue of the biggest selling daily and Sunday papers - the Sun and the News of the World - reaches 26 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, of young people. Last year, ITV beat that just once, with 28 per cent for the Michael Jackson interview with Martin Bashir on 10 February 10.</p> <p>Channel 4's best effort was 23 per cent for the final night of Big Brother. In fact, our research suggests that more young adults read about Big Brother than watch it.</p> <p>Young people know that reading their paper guarantees that they are in on all the gossip, the football, the TV shows and the fashion. When they are with their friends, they enjoy sharing what they have read, and they're confident that they won't look slow or uncool. </p> <p>Reading the paper is so important to them that it comes top of their list of social activities, with 77 per cent reading in the past week, well ahead of the 48 per cent who visit the pub once a week or more. </p> <p>That 77 per cent put newspapers second on their list of media consumption, well ahead of ITV at 69 per cent and C4 at 59 per cent, with cinema at a lowly 16 per cent in the average week. It was pipped only by commercial radio listenership. </p> <p>The newspaper is a pit stop for social refuelling: young adults pick it up on average three times a day, spending an average 30 minutes with it overall. </p> <p>What they find interesting and essential reading is framed by their social needs. They enjoy attention-grabbing headlines, stories or pictures. They like the extreme and the bizarre, and things they can relate to.</p> <p>To illustrate this, we asked a fun question of our 1,000 sample 16-24s: were they confident they could name a series of prominent people? Three-quarters said they could name Posh and Becks' kids or two finalists from Big Brother, but only 44 per cent thought they could identify their local MP and 18 per cent the EU president. It paints a vivid picture of what is important in their lives - and it's not the EU or politics.</p> <p>The highest-octane social fuel is celebrity gossip and TV coverage. 'If it says Big Brother on the front page you go straight to it...'; 'Without it [Big Brother articles] I'd feel like I wasn't involved.' </p> <p>Young women also enjoy fashion, health, films and human interest, while for men of 16-24 it is sport, films, human interest and cars. </p> <p>This all adds up to a big opportunity for advertisers who want to communicate with a group who are notoriously light viewers of commercial television. Even better, this age group are not only ad-literate, they enjoy advertising. Nearly half talk to their mates about 'the good or clever ads we have seen in newspapers'. </p> <p>Encouragingly for advertisers, they openly acknowledge that advertising in newspapers influences their brand choices - 70 per cent agreed that 'I like to look at ads for products that I might buy to get ideas and prices'; while 59 per cent agreed that films that advertise in the papers 'make you think they are worth going to see'. </p> <p>The most effective ads use short, sharp, witty, creative slogans combined with clever placement in the paper. Ads are seen in their editorial setting and there is a definite environment effect that can work to the advantage of the advertiser and paper. </p> <p>To test the ads' effectiveness, we replaced some of the ads in the respondents' papers with the kind of visually striking messages aimed at young adults and normally placed in magazines or outdoors. </p> <p>One such was Right Guard's 'danger rocks' ad placed opposite coverage of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. They applauded this juxtaposition. 'It's an excellent place to put it,' said one. 'I'm A Celebrity is all about challenges and staying cool under pressure.'</p> <p>Celebrity pages evoke thoughts and emotions about looks, going out, what to wear, and this has a 'transfer effect', where the editorial creates a train of thought that helps the reader think about the advertiser's brand. Our research provides tangible evidence of this happening among young women, using ads for Rimmel, Garnier, Diesel and Levi's, among others. </p> <p>A similar effect is true of young men through the sports pages, with Fiat's clever van campaign based around football clubs coming in for special mention, along with Lucozade's use of Michael Owen. Relevant positioning in newspapers creates these powerful associations and a transfer of values. </p> <p>The COI has used such placement to great effect to raise awareness of important issues to young people. Not only did it make clever use of the photo strip format to put over its message on sexually transmitted disease, it sited it perfectly on the Star 's Just Jane page, where sexual problems are discussed regularly, a page this age group loves to share.</p> <p>The ads didn't lose impact from being on newsprint rather than glossy paper. In fact, they stood out better for the readers than they would in magazines, where readers have to leaf through pages of them to get to bits they want to read.</p> <p>Stimulated, entertained, interested, switched on, relaxed is how 16- to 24-year-old readers sum up their mood when reading a newspaper. The newspaper is not a 'fall asleep on the sofa' medium. They are actively seeking ideas and information that they can use throughout that day and late into the night.</p>",
  "<p>'Britain in grip of betting fever' screamed the front-page tabloid headline last week in the wake of publication of a weighty report from the Global Betting and Gaming Consultants, who collate gambling figures from around the world. The past year's off-course betting turnover was put at about \u00a340billion, five times the figure from three years ago. </p> <p> Ten years ago, the National Lottery started and millions became gamblers. Queues formed every Saturday - and later every Wednesday, too - outside shops and supermarkets with Lottery terminals. Some of us who were already punters could not see the attraction, but the Lottery has been a success story. </p> <p> Perhaps the Lottery is to blame for the huge increase in punting. I certainly don't think that Britain has become a nation of lunatic gamblers. For properly crazy gamblers, the Hong Kong Chinese take some beating. In 2002-03, they gambled \u00a35billion on the 700 races at Hong Kong's two racecourses, yet the authorities there were worried that turnover was down. At \u00a37million per race, that is about \u00a31 for each resident of the former colony per race. In 2005, there will be about 9,000 horseraces run in this country (population 60m). If we gambled as they do in Hong Kong, at \u00a31 per person per race, that would make betting turnover on horseracing alone here well over \u00a3500billion. </p> <p> That sort of figure would be beyond the wildest dreams of the British Horseracing Board, whose chief executive, Greg Nichols, has plans for British racing 'from 10 in the morning to 10 at night 363 days a year' in the not too distant future. </p> <p> The BHB are leaving no stone unturned in attempts to provide more races, or 'betting opportunities' for punters, as racing's funding is linked to betting turnover. This has led to a restructuring of Flat racing's bread-and-butter events in an attempt to spread the horse population more efficiently over the increased racing timetable. </p> <p> Undoubtedly, turnover on horseracing has risen considerably since Gordon Brown abolished betting tax in 2001. People who punt still lose overall, but they can make their money last longer with no tax to pay, and thus turnover increases. Betting on the internet has surged and the success of the betting exchanges, where punters offer their own odds for betting or laying, has also contributed to the massive increase in turnover. </p> <p> David Stevens, of Coral bookmakers, sees the increase in gambling as 'a success story for British industry' and cites the abolition of tax as the main reason for the leap. He also says the National Lottery took away 'the stigma surrounding gambling'. </p> <p> Any tampering with the racing programme is unlikely to match the huge impact of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, glorified fruit machines introduced to high street betting shops. They enable punters to enter a miniature casino with electronic card games and roulette. For bookmakers in Britain's 8,800 shops, the FOBT has become the goose that lays the golden egg. For some reason their punters love shovelling their cash into them and the figures are staggering - if not quite as staggering as those from the Hong Kong Jockey Club. </p> <p> The average profit per week per machine is about \u00a3560. Ladbrokes have 6,000 of them, Hills 5,000. There are about 17,000 of these wretched things in the country's betting shops, swelling bookmakers' coffers by \u00a39.5m every week. Of course, the goose may eventually be killed by sheer greed and the number of machines - which could peak at about 28,000 - may dwindle. But if it is just a craze it is still going to be around for a considerable time and, at about \u00a320billion, turnover this year will account for nearly half that of the entire off-course gambling industry. </p> <p> In recent years, with the introduction of Sunday racing and more evening racing, the big bookmakers have required their staff to work longer hours on low wages, but at least they seem to acknowledge their responsibilities with regard to problem gambling, linking with Gamcare, a charity that provides information, advice and help for those who have a dependency on gambling. </p> <p> Stevens says: 'We take our social responsibility very seriously. The bookmaking industry funds Gamcare and, at Coral, we have posters and leaflets in all our shops. We are far more responsible than, say, the brewing industry, who do not have similar links with Alcoholics Anonymous.' Problem gambling, like alcoholism, is an addiction. Support groups are needed. Gamcare's advice with regard to FOBTs is the same as with betting on horses. The charity, which reckoned that five years ago there were about 500,000 gamblers with a problem, fear that there are nearly double that number today. They say: <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> You're buying fun, not investing your money. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Before playing, set strict limits on how much time and money you're going to spend. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Quit when you're ahead. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Only gamble with money you can afford to lose. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't spend more money on gambling with the hope to win back money that you have lost. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep up other interests and hobbies - don't let gambling take over your life. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't gamble in order to escape stress or boredom. <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Above all, if you can't afford to lose; don't play. </p> <p>I would alter the last one with regard to FOBTs to: you can't win, so don't play. Even though the profit on turnover is only 2.5 per cent, it still adds up to \u00a3500m a year. I would rather take my chances with backing horses: at least you know you have a chance of winning. </p> <p> You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>A sobering thought for the Leeds Rhinos as they walk out to face Bradford Bulls at Old Trafford on Saturday in the Super League Grand Final will be the black and white photographs recording the club's previous championship win. A lot has changed in the 32 years since then, but for a club of the stature of Leeds, the lack of success has been a depressing constant.</p> <p>They have won just one major trophy since 1972 - the Challenge Cup in 1999 - scant reward for one of sport's top clubs. They are certainly one of the wealthiest, given their big city profile and earnings from their stewardship of the Test cricket arena.</p> <p>However, the advent of summer rugby and full-time professionalism in 1996 brought wildly contrasting fortunes for these two great Yorkshire rivals. The Bulls reinvented themselves in the summer era and, along with St Helens, have dominated Super League, whereas the Rhinos only just escaped relegation in that inaugural season.</p> <p>After that, they improved and took part in the first Grand Final at Old Trafford in 1998. Although they lost to Wigan, Leeds have consistently challenged for honours since then, but all too often they have fallen at the last hurdle, earning them the tag of 'chokers'. Ironically, that was the label that dogged Bradford after they lost a string of finals to St Helens, but they have removed that monkey from their backs in recent seasons; unfortunately, it seems to have hopped on to the Rhinos.</p> <p>With Leeds United relegated from the Premiership last season and Leeds Tykes pootling around the lower reaches of rugby union's Premiership, the rugby league team need to beat Bradford to restore some sporting pride to the city.</p> <p>Leeds has always been a great rugby league environment and the rivalry with Bradford probably goes back to the Victorian era, when one-upmanship and civic pride spilt over from commerce to the football field. Matches between the two draw crowds in excess of 20,000 and a sell-out at Old Trafford looks likely.</p> <p>It will be an intriguing contest, with Leeds having led Super League from start to finish and doing so in some style, winning by nine points. They have an exciting backline, which includes precocious stand-off Danny McGuire and explosive wing Marcus Bai, who scored a hat-trick in their 40-12 win over Wigan on Friday in the Final Eliminator.</p> <p>There is plenty of grunt up front - which they will need - from the likes of Matt Adamson, Ryan Bailey and Danny Ward. Bradford's success has been founded on an overtly physical approach, which does not endear them to the purists but has brought them spectacular rewards.</p> <p>They won all three trophies on offer last season and were tipped by some to go through this campaign unbeaten, but Bradford were less than convincing for periods this year and began looking their old selves only towards the latter part of the season. They have been beaten by Leeds three times this year, but in the Qualifying semi-final, the Bulls triumphed to march to Old Trafford for the fourth consecutive year. Extra spice will be added to the contest by the appearance of former Leeds golden boy Iestyn Harris in Bradford colours.</p> <p>This season Bradford brought Harris back from rugby union in Wales, a move that infuriated their rivals, who thought that they had first option on the stand-off if he returned to league. The move is still the subject of legal action between the player and Leeds and Harris will be out to prove a point.</p> <p>Bradford coach Brian Noble admits that he has been surprised at how quickly Harris has settled back into the sport. 'I quite honestly didn't think he'd be as impressive as he is now,' he said. 'I thought it would be next year, but he's fitted in really quickly. I suppose it's like riding a bike - he's got up to speed pretty quick.'</p> <p>Harris could turn the game with his silky skills and allied to the shrewd tactical awareness of his half-back partner, Paul Deacon, they pose a real threat. Leeds will first have to tame the massive Bradford pack, which includes outstanding Great Britain prop Stuart Fielden. Although Bradford have lost Leon Pryce with a shoulder injury, they have plenty of firepower out wide, including blockbusting wing Lesley Vainikolo, Super League's record try-scorer.</p> <p>Although they will have had the luxury of a week off while Leeds were battling past Wigan, Noble is far from complacent. 'We'll be working as hard as we have done in previous years with a view to winning the trophy,' he said. 'Going to the final and getting beat is not what we're about. We need to play better and we'll concentrate on that element of improvement.'</p> <p>Tony Smith, the Leeds coach who has done a terrific job in his first year with the club, knows his team have the ability to lift the trophy, but it may come down to mental toughness. 'The players are pretty determined,' he said. 'We've earned the right to be there and challenge the champions. We want to go there and give it a real shot.'</p> <p>The defeat at the hands of Bradford a little more than a week ago might have dented their confidence and, as in that match, the opening 20 minutes could be crucial. Another poor start by Leeds and the 'chokers' tag could be with them a little longer. But if they play as they have done for much of the season, there should be a colour photograph to brighten up the walls at Headingley.</p> <p>Leigh centurions take on Whitehaven at the Halton Stadium, Widnes, this afternoon in the League One Grand Final. The winners will take Castleford's place in Super League next season.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p><strong>Bride And Prejudice </strong><br>(112 mins, PG) <br>Directed by Gurinder Chadha; starring Aishwarya Rai, Martin Henderson, Naveen Andrews</p> <p>Comica transpositions are nothing new in the cinema - the 1940 Cary Grant classic My Favourite Wife was inspired by Tennyson's Enoch Arden and Jacques Tourneur's 1943 horror movie, I Walked with a Zombie , is a version of Jane Eyre . But there has been quite a spate of them these past few years. We've see The Taming of the Shrew, Les Liaisons Dangereuses and Emma relocated to American high schools, and now Gurinder Chadha's Bride and Prejudice re-creates Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as a Bollywood musical. </p> <p>Of course, borrowing plots from anything fashionable in world cinema is standard practice in Bombay, and there have been stage musicals of Pride and Prejudice - I saw one at the Birmingham Rep some years ago starring Patricia Routledge as Mrs Bennet. What is new is having a Bollywood musical conceived in the West and co-produced by Miramax, whose boss, Harvey Weinstein, makes a jolly appearance on the streets of India during Bride and Prejudice 's final credits. </p> <p>Chadha, as she has shown in her previous pictures - Bhaji on the Beach, What's Cooking? , Bend It Like Beckham - is a crowd-pleaser, and the chief characteristics of her new film are populist cheek and cosmopolitan chic rather than subtle social observation. The film establishes its tone from the start. Jane Austen begins her novel with one of the most famous lines in English literature - 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.' This becomes, in the mouth of the incredibly beautiful Aishwarya Rai (playing Lalita Bakshi, the film's version of Elizabeth Bennet): 'Anyone who's got big bucks is shopping for a wife.' </p> <p>Austen's little England, around which people take long journeys by coach, is replaced by the global village of the Indian diaspora, where well-off Indians travel by plane. Longbourne, Hertfordshire becomes Amritsar, Punjab, the 'Hicksville, India' hometown of Mr Bakshi and his outrageously vulgar wife (who have one daughter less to dispose of than Austen's Bennets), and the action spreads out to Goa, London and Los Angeles. </p> <p>The American hotel magnate Will Darcy (Martin Henderson) comes to Amritsar with his friend, the handsome London-based lawyer Balraj (Naveen Andrews), and Balraj's snooty sister, and begins his complex romance with the headstrong, outspoken Lalita. There is, however, so little chemistry between the two that this encounter between East and West fulfils Kipling's claim that never the twain shall meet. </p> <p>Lalita's suitor, Chadha's substitute for the insensitive vicar William Collins, is Mr Kholi (Nitin Ganatra), a ludicrous Ali G figure. The film's principal comic butt, Kholi is a successful accountant in Los Angeles who has come home to find a wife. He considers that Indian girls who have grown up in California 'have lost their roots and are clueless'. This refers, presumably, to Clueless , Amy Heckerling's brilliant Bev erly Hills version of Emma . The picture's chief attraction, apart from its gorgeous leading actress, is the ingenuity of the transposition. Particularly amusing is the way the military cad George Wickham becomes a backpacking bounder. Prior to seduction he takes Lalita's sister Lucky (ie Lydia) on the London Eye, and is then pursued into the National Film Theatre by Darcy, where they have a fight on stage while a Bombay musical featuring a melodramatic seducer is projected behind them. But the movie is ultimately trite and banal rather than poised, and this comes from its chosen form. Are we watching a parody of a Bollywood musical, or a pastiche? Are we intended to find the broad effects, the musical routines, the crude acting funny because they're so naive? </p> <p>In simultaneously sending up and celebrating Bombay cinema, Chadha is trying to have her chapati and eat it. Satyajit Ray, India's only great movie director, has often and rightly been compared with Chekhov. Bride and Prejudice is not even a baby Austen. It's Mills and Boon, which we know to have been the favourite reading of Ray's friend Indira Gandhi.</p>",
  "<p>There is a terrible joke much loved by scientists, but not many others. A man spots a farmer standing in a field in the rain. 'Why?' he asks. The farmer replies: 'I am trying to win a Nobel Prize. You get one for being out standing in your field.' </p> <p>If only it was that easy. As researchers will tell you, the real thing requires decades of commitment, hard graft, luck, and some grey matter - although these days you will need another key qualification: a US passport, or at least a US chequebook. </p> <p>Just take a look at last week's batch of Nobels in chemistry, physics and medicine. Medicine went to American smell researchers Richard Axel and Linda Buck; physics went to a trio of US quark physicists, David Gross, David Politzer and Frank Wilczek; while chemistry was awarded to cell researchers Dr Irwin Rose (from California) and two Israeli researchers, Prof Avram Hershko and Prof Aaron Ciechanover. The Israeli pair, it should be noted, were backed by generous US research funds, and have spent a great deal of time working in America (though it should be acknowledged that they carried out some key research in their home country). </p> <p>Americans have dominated the world's three most prestigious science prizes for more than two decades, but now things seem to be getting out of hand. All the 2004 science Nobels were backed and directed by American cash, a point noted by UK cancer researcher Tim Hunt, winner of the 2001 Nobel medicine prize. 'It is certainly startling and worrying. Nobel destinations fluctuate a fair bit. Britain did quite well in 2003, and who knows what might happen next year. However, Nobels are just tips of a science iceberg. The more tips, the bigger must be the iceberg underneath. All this preponderance of Nobels really shows is how vast is the US science hegemony.' </p> <p>But what does this near monopoly mean for the rest of the world, and how, exactly, has the US managed to achieve it? The second question is the easier to answer: because America commits such a large percentage of its vast wealth to science. The $27 billion budget of the National Institutes of Health dwarfs that of any other organisation in the world, and US backing for other sciences is equally lavish. </p> <p>But this begs a subsidiary question: why the largesse? That is trickier to answer though observers agree it reflects a deep American interest in the universe, a lack of the anti-science snobbery that pervades Europe, and a justified belief that discoveries can be exploited to improve life and make money. </p> <p>Which takes us to the global implications? 'Numbers of prizes don't matter,' says UK Nobel chemistry winner Sir Harry Kroto. 'What is important is America's commitment to turning discoveries into products. Here, they are also utterly dominant. Technologically, they are far more vigorous and aggressive.' </p> <p>British scientists will doubtless argue we still do pretty well Nobel-wise. Maybe, but not that well. Since 1990, Americans have won 24 physics Nobels, 19 for chemistry and 21 for medicine. No other country has got more than three in any category except for Britain which has won, very creditably, six for medicine. It is still no contest, of course. Today, if you want to do science, America is the only destination. Once young US researchers headed to Europe to learn basic research. Now the direction is reversed. Forty per cent of scientists in the US were born in Europe. Few are expected to return. </p> <p>The black hole of US science is simply sucking in money and talent, leaving Britain more and more isolated. We are trying hard but if we are not careful our best Nobel chances may one day be restricted to joining farmers in their fields.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Additional research: <strong>Tom Wainwright</strong></p>",
  "<p>There are those who lift your spirits, and those who keep you on your toes. Professor John Kenneth Galbraith has lifted the spirits of several generations of politicians, officials, economists, students and general readers around the world. He has also kept them on their toes. </p> <p>Galbraith is due to celebrate his 96th birthday this coming Friday. When I had lunch with him and his wife of 67 years, Catherine, in their house just outside the Harvard campus last week, it was a perfect day, autumn was beginning and the great man was in fighting form, despite still being in a wheelchair after a recent illness. He was also struggling with various deaf-aids, but the spirit was, as always, indomitable. </p> <p>I was carrying a copy of his latest book The Economics of Innocent Fraud , in which he attacks politicians and the media for colluding 'in the myths of a benign \"market\" that big business always knows best, that minimal intervention stimulates the economy, that obscene pay gaps and unrestrained self-enrichment are an inevitable by-product of the system'. </p> <p>It is, as he remarked, his 'smallest book, but has taken the longest amount of time'. He had been working on it when we last met two years ago, but he rewrote in between stays in hospital, after the fall-out from the Enron crisis proved a dramatic illustration of his thesis that there is nothing that unfettered chief executives will not do to feather their own nests. </p> <p>Before signing my copy, Galbraith drew my attention to the illustration on the cover. 'This is the roughest thing I've ever had on a book of mine - an executive briefcase scattering bombs!' In a world where US foreign policy in Iraq has been dictated by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others with strong corporate links, Galbraith, who has campaigned about the power of large corporations since The Affluent Society (1958) and The New Industrial State (1967), is, as it were, sticking to his guns. </p> <p>My own association with Galbraith is a long one. The Affluent Society contained a powerful Keynesian attack on the classical economists who held that unemployment was something about which governments could do little. Galbraith, following Keynes, writes like a dream, and reading The Affluent Society was one of the factors that led a number of my generation to study economics. It is not for nothing that another great influence, the Nobel prize-winning Amartya Sen, describes Galbraith as 'the most widely read economist in the world'.</p> <p>Alas, later in our conversation, Galbraith went on to lament 'this is the only government in 30 or 40 years with no one in authority who has ever heard of John Maynard Keynes'. But we are jumping ahead. As Catherine Galbraith offered a glass of sherry, the professor boomed: 'I'm still partly crippled, but alcohol is still remedial.'</p> <p>Then, before I could ask a question, he sailed in. 'Let's start with a few problems I have. Is Blair in trouble?' I said he ought to be, but it might be wishful thinking on my part, and reminded him of Lord Hailsham's dictum that the British political system is an 'elective dictatorship'. </p> <p>Galbraith continued: 'It's a strange political calculation of his to stay for so long in support of George Bush. Why did he do that?' I said his bafflement was shared by many here. </p> <p>The wise professor, who has advised both FD Roosevelt and JF Kennedy in his time, went on to express very strong views: 'It is not a good design for relations with the US because the active voices in this country on international policy are all in conflict with Bush.' What the 'special relationship' needed was 'a certain deeper association and alliance with someone who is responsibly critical. For whatever reason, that has not been the case in Britain'. </p> <p>In Galbraith's view the French were more in tune with reality. 'Politics must take account not only of the position of the government but also of the forces behind it, and Blair does not have the support of the articulate in the US.' </p> <p>He added: 'And that is the group which has always thought well of a certain allied relationship with Britain.' He paused. 'There was a better decision by Winston Churchill!' </p> <p>At this stage I tried to move the conversation back to The Economics of Innocent Fraud and get him to say something about Conrad Black, his fellow Canadian, with whom I recalled he had not been too enamoured on a previous occasion. But he would not be moved. </p> <p>'Why has Britain been so tolerant of George Bush and his gang?' He smiled, adding, 'I always interview the reporter.' </p> <p>I did my best to answer this. He then said that perhaps it was partly because 'a lot of things important to the US do not have the same repercussions in Britain'. </p> <p>Warming to his theme, he said: 'This is a crude government, and its crude misdirection of power in minor things has more direct impact domestically than abroad.' Such as? </p> <p>'One of the worst things - unimaginable in Britain - is the open character of legislation for the rich, particularly on taxation; and the open resistance to support for the poor.' </p> <p>But that was not all. 'When income tax reductions,' he pauses and revises 'reductions' to 'slashes', 'were put into effect they were combined with this warning: \"Let's not open the way for a softer policy for the poor and the unemployed\" - a softer policy that in Keynesian terms might have been a more im portant factor in alleviating the recession.' </p> <p>Many people enter their 'anecdotage' at ages much younger than Galbraith's. Although he was happy to reminisce, he kept returning to the gravity of the present US and world scene. </p> <p>'We are seeing the disintegration of the American economic and wider world role, which could well continue after this election. I am talking about the passage of power to the Rumsfelds of the economic and political structure.' </p> <p>In his new book, Galbraith points out that in the fiscal year 2003 'close to half the total of US government discretionary expenditure [outlay not mandated for particular use, such as social security or service of the public debt] was used for military purposes - for defence, as more favourably it is called'. </p> <p>In one sense, as he acknowledges, little has changed since President Eisenhower warned in the 1950s of a 'military industrial complex'. As Galbraith says, 'a large, vital and expanding part of what is called the public sector is for all practical effect in the private sector... much [arms expenditure] is at the initiative and with the authority of the arms industry and its political voice - the private sector. </p> <p>Galbraith gave a dire warning of what would happen if Bush was re-elected. 'Under the thrust of power of present forces, including the money-making powers, there's going to be a continuing and disastrous [American] decline. The Rumsfelds and the Cheneys will still be there, and anyone with a grasp of world history should be here to report it.' He smiled and said: 'Why don't you do that?' </p> <p>The great man feels passionately. 'In all my 90-odd years, I've never had such a clear view of the future,' adding with a twinkle in his eye, 'with still, of course, the possibility of being wrong.' But only the possibility. 'I have a feeling that not since the end of World War Two have we had such a time when the role of wisdom, action and misunderstanding in the US has such worldwide consequences.' </p> <p>He says he is now working on a new book. With that he was assisted into a chair (made in Newcastle, England) that hoisted him up the stairs, as if on a domestic funicular railway, for his afternoon nap. </p> <p>As he disappeared from sight he called out: 'There's just one more thing.' His nurse brought down a car bumper sticker, with a picture of George Bush. The slogan was: 'Some things were never meant to be recycled.'</p>",
  "<p>Big bank, big money, big egos. A potentially heady concoction at the best of times and no more so than at Lazard, the pukka investment house that is lining up a $3 billion flotation on Wall Street next year. </p> <p>Things are never simple at Lazard, which spans operations in Paris, London and New York, and where office politics can be brutal, even by City standards. In the past, Lazard has been riven by infighting and turf wars; its semi-autonomous offices in Europe and the United States doing little to conceal their contempt for each other. </p> <p>Now, Lazard's flotation proposals, put forward by its American boss, Bruce Wasserstein, have sparked more arguments, which have burst into the open, much to the chagrin of the old guard, who usually eschew publicity. </p> <p>Last week one broke cover to say: 'Whoever is leaking these stories [citing dissent within the firm over the terms of the float] should be strung up. It's quite disgraceful.' </p> <p>Disgraceful it might be, but where money and power are so important, there are bound to be disagreements about the carve-up of the spoils. Not everyone wants to abandon the partnership structure for a new life as a public com pany. Goldman Sachs, which floated in 1999, experienced a similar internal debate, although less fractious.</p> <p>For Lazard the questions that are most vexing are these: who is eligible for equity in the event of a float? And how much should each individual get? Inevitably that leads to another question: why should he or she get more than me? Those disputes are common enough following the distribution of City bonuses each year; in fact, no issue is more divisive in an investment bank. </p> <p>Throw into this pot several larger-than-life personalities - senior operatives with searing intellects working in an environment where there is a degree of insecurity about one's ability to pull off the next deal - and you have a recipe for... well, let's just say creative tension.</p> <p>The latest twist to the Lazard story can be traced to the arrival of Wasserstein, the legendary Wall Street dealmaker, brought in to lead the firm by chairman Michel David-Weill four years ago. </p> <p>Prior to Wasserstein's arrival, Lazard was in trouble. Senior partners such as John Nelson and Nigel Turner left or were poached by rivals. Their departures heralded an era when Lazard began slipping down the investment-banking league tables. </p> <p>At about the same time, the firm was rocked by the sudden departure of Bill Loomis, who fell out with David-Weill, a descendant of the founding French families and septuagenarian aristocrat who is both demanding and patrician in his approach.</p> <p>But in Wasserstein, David-Weill appears to have met his match, the former insisting that he be ceded overall managerial control before coming aboard. As soon as Wasserstein was installed, there was little doubt in City circles that his endgame was to either sell or float Lazard. </p> <p>Stories soon began circulating about Wasserstein phoning rival bankers whom he was keen to recruit. He promised chunky bonuses and large amounts of equity that could be realised in the event of a sale or flotation. Wasserstein brought in some big names, pushing Lazard back up the league tables. Suddenly the firm, whose mainstay is advising companies on mergers, acquisitions and restructurings, was coming into its own again. </p> <p>Its partners were involved in multi-billion-pound deals involving Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals giant, as well as the the Bank One merger with JP Morgan in the US, and the sale of the Telegraph titles to the Barclay brothers in Britain.</p> <p>But before long, Wasserstein had his first public spat with David-Weill. The chairman was incensed that the American had been spending so much on recruiting top dealmakers that there was less money in the form of dividends for Lazard's capitalists, or non-working partners, who occupy five of the 11 seats on the board. Somehow the rift was healed.</p> <p>David-Weill's friends say he has never championed a float, but he will not use his veto to block one. Now it is believed that, after weeks of negotiations, he and other non-working partners - who own a sizeable stake of Lazard - have agreed to sell out in the event of an IPO. But there is a condition: David-Weill will not go ahead unless Wasserstein has the full support of the working partners, and not all have agreed.</p> <p>As a consequence, Wasserstein was forced to delay his plans last week after a board meeting in Paris. And he has had to soften his stance with the dissidents - initially he set a deadline of last Wednesday for them to agree to flotation, then backtracked to give them more time. The dissidents are concerned about how equity will be divided, and how much power will be concentrated in Wasserstein's hands. Some spoke of dictatorial tendencies. </p> <p>People who know him rebut such suggestions: 'Whatever people say, Bruce is a most benign dictator, and a brilliant negotiator; if anyone can pull off a deal, he can.' </p> <p>But this is Lazard, and despite his success in breaking down barriers between London, New York and Paris, there are many influential and astute players within the firm - men like Georges Railly, one of the leading partners at the Paris office. The dissidents speak for a quarter of Lazard's annual income, so they cannot be easily dismissed. But the latest talk was that many had been won round, and that Wasserstein will get to float Lazard in the spring.</p> <p>Not that the story will end there. A New York analyst said: 'Once Lazard floats, you can bet that the directors won't rest till the bank is sold to a larger competitor, although selling investment banks is not as easy a task as it used to be.'</p> <p>Nor should we discount the possibility of a trade sale if an IPO fails to materialise.</p> <p>Lazard, as a public company with a primary listing in New York, under the full glare of Wall Street's number- crunchers, is still a strange notion to those whose image of the firm is of a discreet sounding board for companies in search of impartial advice. Even now, it's not clear why Lazard needs to float - the firm doesn't need to raise funds to bolster its balance sheet. </p> <p>But an IPO will tidy up Lazard's messy shareholder structure, give David-Weill and his allies an exit, and make Wasserstein and his colleagues a great deal of money. Incentives enough.</p> <p><strong>King of 1,000 deals</strong></p> <p>'Bid 'em up' Bruce Wasserstein is synonymous with the image of the brash, no-nonsense American banker. Wasserstein, 56, caught the world's attention in the late 1980s when he was involved in a deal that saw KKR, the US buyout specialist, acquire tobacco giant RJR Nabisco for $25 billion, the largest buyout deal of the time. </p> <p>Since then, the deals have come thick and fast. Wasserstein advised Dean Witter on its takeover of Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley and Wal-Mart on its purchase of Asda.</p> <p>He was involved with the $180 billion merger of AOL and Time Warner. In total, he has been linked to 1,000 deals on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>After he sold his firm, Wasserstein Pirella, to Dresdner of Germany - a transaction that is reported to have netted him a cool $650m - he fell out with his new master after it was absorbed by German insurer Allianz. Allianz blocked Wasserstein's plan to spin off and float the investment-banking arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.</p> <p>When the call came from Michel David-Weill to head Lazard, Wasserstein was happy to bid farewell to his German employers.</p>",
  "<p>Forget property, technology or corporate bonds - hedge funds are the investment business of the moment. The amount of money invested in them in Europe more than doubled in the 18 months to June and the global industry now has more than $800 billion (\u00a3450bn) in 8,000 funds.</p> <p>That growth is expected to continue, fuelled by demand from pension and insurance companies, which are only just starting to consider them as a potential investment, and private individuals. </p> <p>But the surge in popularity is accompanied by a surge in scepticism. The doubters are asking three key questions: can the high historic returns which are attracting the wave of new investment continue as the industry expands so dramatically? Can hedge fund managers continue to justify their high fees? And does the rapid growth increase the risk of a repeat, on an even larger scale, of the collapse of Long Term Capital Management which rocked the industry six years ago? </p> <p>This year's performance statistics give plenty of fuel to the sceptics. There are a host of hedge fund indices to choose from but all show that returns have been the worst for six years. The Eurohedge Composite index, for example, has shown negative or only marginally positive results for the last six months and is showing only a 2.11 per cent gain for the year so far. </p> <p>The index calculated by Hennessee Group, a leading firm of hedge fund consultants, shows growth of just 1.16 per cent, three times better than the 0.43 per cent rise in the S &amp; P 500 but still paltry. </p> <p>'Hedge funds are not really absolute return,' said Charles Gradante, managing principal at Hennessee. 'They are really relative to equity and bond markets. If these markets are poor, hedge funds will perform at less than par.' </p> <p>But he adds that, over longer periods, hedge funds will produce better returns regardless of whether stock markets are good. In the four years of the bear market between 2000 and 2004, hedge funds would have turned $100 into $129, while a similar investment in the S&amp;P would have fallen to $80. </p> <p>Others wonder if the poor performance is more systemic: the more hedge funds there are seeking out anomalies in asset pricing - the holy grail of hedge fund mathematicians - the faster these anomalies, and the profits which can be made from them, will disappear. Their behaviour has also become so prominent, the argument goes, that conventional investors can easily wrongfoot them. </p> <p>That is backed up by last week's report from JP Morgan, which concludes that some hedge fund strategies, such as betting on changes to the FTSE 100 and other indices, or convertible bond arbitrage, will no longer produce good returns. But analysts believe there are still profits to be made from other strategies, particularly in the bond and foreign exchange market. </p> <p>But John Demaine, of Barclays Global Investors, says there are 'as many anomalies as you can think of but they do change over time. You need to keep looking for new sources of inefficiency'. </p> <p>He adds: 'There is some risk that, on average, hedge funds could produce less attractive returns than in the past.' While that may put pressure on their high fees - hedge funds generally charge at least a 2 per cent flat fee plus performance fees of anything from 20 per cent to half of the fund's profits - Demaine believes it could lead to increased charges for the good ones. </p> <p>Charles Beazley, head of institutional and alternative assets at Gartmore, also believes there will be a shake-out among funds. He points out that three-quarters of all hedge funds have less than $100m under management. 'Unless you have more than $75m under management you will not be in a break-even position commercially.' He also predicts that there will be a growing institutionalisation of the hedge fund business as more funds are offered by firms like Gartmore instead of a couple of mathematics PhDs working in their own offices in Mayfair. </p> <p>As the industry has grown, so has its influence on financial markets. While hedge funds look small compared to the $40 trillion global financial industry, they have a disproportionate influence in some areas of the market. That is partly because of their borrowings: some hedge funds can borrow as much as 50 times what their investors have put in as equity, although the average for the industry, according to Hennessee, is between two and three times. </p> <p>But hedge funds tend to be concentrated in particular areas. Demaine says that as much as 80 per cent of new convertible bond issues are taken up by hedge funds, while others estimate that they can account for as much as 30 per cent of equity turnover in a given day. That activity will often be concentrated into a few companies - like Marks and Spencer and DFS Furniture, where recent bid activity attracted considerable hedge fund buying. </p> <p>The combination of borrowing and focus on specific situations is seen by many as high risk, and predictions of hedge fund Armageddon are growing. Gartmore's Beazley insists that hedge fund investing is all about controlling risk: conventional investors buying a share will be exposed to risks ranging from oil price changes to management fraud; a hedge fund manager will aim to hedge all these, leaving only the risk where he expects to make a profit. </p> <p>That is fine in individual funds - provided their bet is right. Collectively, however, the weight of money betting in particular directions is risky - and the pessimists note that it was only intervention by the regulators that prevented Long Term Capital Management's failure precipitating a global financial collapse. </p> <p>Several firms - ranging from Close Brothers to the Woolwich building society - have launched products aimed at retail investors, and the Financial Services Authority is considering authorising hedge funds for marketing to individuals. </p> <p>Even if the pundits are right that there is no risk of a hedge fund collapse, and that there are still plenty of opportunities to get good returns, history suggests that the mass arrival of retail investors coincides with the top of the market.</p> <p><strong>Man overboard?</strong></p> <p>Man Group, headed by Stanley Fink is one of the the leading hedge fund managers, so it is perhaps unsurprising that its fortunes should mirror attitudes to the industry. Over the past five years its shares have soared as it turned itself from a boring commodities trader into a go-go hedge fund manager. For much of this year, however, shares have been falling as investors questioned whether Man's success was sustainable while hedge fund returns went down. </p> <p>Last month's trading statement added grist to the mill. While it was hardly a disastrous profits warning, it did indicate that, over the last three months, it has been losing money. It is now suffering the ignominy of being the victim of hedge funds itself: first, they were selling in the expectation that its reputation was dimming; now, they are buying because of its status as the market's favourite bid target.</p> <p>To be fair, the bid talk is not just because of its poor share price performance. The big investment banks are keen on entering the market. Man Group would offer banks like Merrill Lynch or Citigroup, the two favourite names in the frame, an excellent way into the business.</p> <p>Last week the group was maintaining a dignified silence, stung by the poor response to its trading statement and what it sees as a welter of hostile comments about the prospects for hedge funds.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Bride And Prejudice </strong><br>(112 mins, PG) <br>Directed by Gurinder Chadha; starring Aishwarya Rai, Martin Henderson, Naveen Andrews</p> <p>Comica transpositions are nothing new in the cinema - the 1940 Cary Grant classic My Favourite Wife was inspired by Tennyson's Enoch Arden and Jacques Tourneur's 1943 horror movie, I Walked with a Zombie , is a version of Jane Eyre . But there has been quite a spate of them these past few years. We've see The Taming of the Shrew, Les Liaisons Dangereuses and Emma relocated to American high schools, and now Gurinder Chadha's Bride and Prejudice re-creates Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as a Bollywood musical. </p> <p>Of course, borrowing plots from anything fashionable in world cinema is standard practice in Bombay, and there have been stage musicals of Pride and Prejudice - I saw one at the Birmingham Rep some years ago starring Patricia Routledge as Mrs Bennet. What is new is having a Bollywood musical conceived in the West and co-produced by Miramax, whose boss, Harvey Weinstein, makes a jolly appearance on the streets of India during Bride and Prejudice 's final credits. </p> <p>Chadha, as she has shown in her previous pictures - Bhaji on the Beach , What's Cooking? , Bend It Like Beckham - is a crowd-pleaser, and the chief characteristics of her new film are populist cheek and cosmopolitan chic rather than subtle social observation. The film establishes its tone from the start. Jane Austen begins her novel with one of the most famous lines in English literature - 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.' This becomes, in the mouth of the incredibly beautiful Aishwarya Rai (playing Lalita Bakshi, the film's version of Elizabeth Bennet): 'Anyone who's got big bucks is shopping for a wife.' </p> <p>Austen's little England, around which people take long journeys by coach, is replaced by the global village of the Indian diaspora, where well-off Indians travel by plane. Longbourne, Hertfordshire becomes Amritsar, Punjab, the 'Hicksville, India' hometown of Mr Bakshi and his outrageously vulgar wife (who have one daughter less to dispose of than Austen's Bennets), and the action spreads out to Goa, London and Los Angeles. </p> <p>The American hotel magnate Will Darcy (Martin Henderson) comes to Amritsar with his friend, the handsome London-based lawyer Balraj (Naveen Andrews), and Balraj's snooty sister, and begins his complex romance with the headstrong, outspoken Lalita. There is, however, so little chemistry between the two that this encounter between East and West fulfils Kipling's claim that never the twain shall meet. </p> <p>Lalita's suitor, Chadha's substitute for the insensitive vicar William Collins, is Mr Kholi (Nitin Ganatra), a ludicrous Ali G figure. The film's principal comic butt, Kholi is a successful accountant in Los Angeles who has come home to find a wife. He considers that Indian girls who have grown up in California 'have lost their roots and are clueless'. This refers, presumably, to Clueless , Amy Heckerling's brilliant Bev erly Hills version of Emma . The picture's chief attraction, apart from its gorgeous leading actress, is the ingenuity of the transposition. Particularly amusing is the way the military cad George Wickham becomes a backpacking bounder. Prior to seduction he takes Lalita's sister Lucky (ie Lydia) on the London Eye, and is then pursued into the National Film Theatre by Darcy, where they have a fight on stage while a Bombay musical featuring a melodramatic seducer is projected behind them. But the movie is ultimately trite and banal rather than poised, and this comes from its chosen form. Are we watching a parody of a Bollywood musical, or a pastiche? Are we intended to find the broad effects, the musical routines, the crude acting funny because they're so naive? </p> <p>In simultaneously sending up and celebrating Bombay cinema, Chadha is trying to have her chapati and eat it. Satyajit Ray, India's only great movie director, has often and rightly been compared with Chekhov. Bride and Prejudice is not even a baby Austen. It's Mills and Boon, which we know to have been the favourite reading of Ray's friend Indira Gandhi.</p>",

  "<p>Margaret, 55, was a late developer pension-wise and now wants to make up for lost time. She writes:</p> <p>'I left school at 15 and worked in a variety of jobs, none of which involved a pension. </p> <p>In my early twenties I went back to college to get my A-levels and then did a degree in politics and modern history. This meant I was 30 by the time I finished university. </p> <p>After that I did a teaching qualification but by that time I was married. I then had two sons, so I only worked part-time. I didn't get a full-time teaching job until 1992 and only then did I join the pension scheme. </p> <p>Assuming I retire when I am 60, I will have contributed about 17 years to the teachers' pension scheme and 13 years to a FSAVC scheme. I estimate that when I retire these will provide me with a pension of about \u00a34,200 a year. I am not sure what state pension I am entitled to and whether it would be advantageous to buy back any of the years I have missed. </p> <p>My eldest son, who is 19, has just started his second year at university and my younger is 17 and still at school, so he still has about four years further education to complete. </p> <p>My husband is a self-employed chartered surveyor and has a personal pension, but this has gone down considerably in value in recent years. </p> <p>We have a repayment mortgage of \u00a325,000 which will be paid off in seven years' time, but we have no other debts. </p> <p>We have about \u00a350,000 invested in shares, such as the privatisations and demutualisations. I also have \u00a314,500 invested in premium bonds on behalf of my two sons. </p> <p>I currently save \u00a3100 a month in a building society to pay for things such as holidays. I estimate I could save another \u00a3250 or so towards my pension. </p> <p>Should I buy added years, or would it be better to buy a cottage in the country which would appreciate in value as our own home has done? </p> <p>We wouldn't let this out: it would be for our own enjoyment.'</p> <p><strong>You will have more money than you think</strong></p> <p>Many middle-aged women find themselves in a similar position to yours. Pensions were not a priority when they were young and even if they did pay into one, they would usually take a refund of contributions when they moved jobs or stopped work to start a family. Cash in hand seemed more important at the time. Many now regret those decisions as they near retirement and have little pension to look forward to. </p> <p>With regard to your state pension, you may not be in as bad a position as you think, says Robert Reid of independent financial advisers Syndaxi. During the years when you were working part-time looking after your children, you will probably have qualified for home responsibilities protection (HRP). This reduces the number of years of National Insurance contributions you need to qualify for the basic state retirement pension.</p> <p>HRP has been available since April 1978 and is given automatically to anyone receiving child benefit for a child under 16, although Reid says problems can arise if the child benefit has been credited to the father's bank account rather than the mother's.</p> <p>The best way to find out how much state pension you can expect is to request a state pension forecast from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) on 0845 300 0168. The staff will fill in your application over the phone. Alternatively, get form BR19 from your local DWP office or the internet and send in a written request. Unfortunately, if you have gaps in your contribution record dating from your twenties you will not be able to rectify them as there is a time limit of six years for making good missing contributions.</p> <p>Buying added years to boost your teachers' pension is a sensible idea, says Clive Down, retirement specialist at financial adviser Pendleton May. The huge advantage is that you will know exactly how much extra pension you will get for your money and that it will be index-linked. Added years are even more attractive if your salary rises or you get another promotion as your pension will rise automatically in line. The drawback may be the high cost.</p> <p>The alternatives are making extra AVCs (additional voluntary contributions) or contributing to a stakeholder pension. But Robert Reid says you should first look into your existing FSAVC scheme: 'It is important for Margaret to check the charges and the type of fund she is paying into so she can see whether they are still appropriate.' If the charges are over 1 per cent per annum you would be better off transferring to a cheaper stakeholder pension. If you are planning to retire at 60 you should consider moving your pension savings into the safer environment of a cash or fixed-interest fund if they are not there already.</p> <p>Reid believes you should be considering a similar course of action with your share portfolio, especially as you appear to be uncomfortable with stock market investments. He suggests: 'Why not sell the shares and switch the mortgage to an offset arrangement with a lender such as Intelligent Finance, putting the proceeds of the shares into an allied savings account. Your savings would be in a secure environment, reducing the interest on your mortgage, and you would be able to pay off your mortgage quicker.'

  "<p>'Malcolm Glazer is a Red. He hates Scousers.' As football chants go, it has a certain ring to it. But it may be some time before the Stretford End's partisans cheer Glazer as one of their own. And first the Florida tycoon must convince a sceptical Square Mile that he can make his mooted takeover of Manchester United work. </p> <p>His proposal is still taking shape, but is expected to become an \u00a3800 million formal offer within weeks, perhaps days. The club's well-drilled supporters' groups, stridently opposed to any takeover, are mobilising. </p> <p>'We're not impressed by Glazer, either by the substance of his bid or by his PR flim-flam,' said Oliver Houston of Shareholders United. 'At least Rupert Murdoch [who attempted to acquire the club in 1998] was willing to buy United with his own money. Glazer wants to use someone else's.' </p> <p>Supporters' groups own more than the 10 per cent of the company needed to prevent a compulsory share purchase, guaranteeing an annual showdown between the new management and hostile fans and at United's shareholder meetings. Small wonder that Glazer has already attempted to placate fans, letting it be known that the club would buy top players under his stewardship and that he is an admirer of Sir Alex Ferguson, United's manager. </p> <p>As much as the supporters can make trouble for Glazer and his sons Joel and Bryan, however, they can't really stop him taking over. But the City can. </p> <p>Glazer, who already has a 19 per cent stake in United, has hired JP Morgan to arrange a \u00a3400m-plus syndicated loan to fund his bid. It has been suggested that his ideal would be to put himself at the head of a consortium backed by private equity groups. But sources close to Glazer said this weekend that he is looking for lenders, not partners; he wants to own United as well as run it. </p> <p>Glazer has property interests in the US and owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football club. This makes him worth about \u00a3600m - not quite enough, at first glance, to buy United on its own. If he wanted to borrow the requisite \u00a3800m on the strength of those assets, though, he could probably do it. </p> <p>But Glazer, 76, may have no intention of using his personal fortune as collateral in a United deal. It is more likely that he wants to borrow against United's assets and future earnings instead. </p> <p>This is the kind of highly leveraged takeover that has been championed in the recent past by Philip Green, Britain's best-known retail entrepreneur. But it could expose Glazer to the charge of asset-stripping and put him on a colli sion course with fans. What's more, it requires him to convince financial institutions to sink their money into football - a sector that investors fled long ago. </p> <p>Debt-free and modestly profitable, Manchester United has always been the best-run football club, but its value as a serious investment is limited. 'The share price does not warrant buying into it. Glazer and his associates would be overpaying if they did,' says Andrew Lee, football business analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. </p> <p>Lee believes would-be lenders might come to the same conclusion. 'You have to wonder whether this isn't all about an older man's dream to run the biggest sports club in the world.' </p> <p>Stock market reaction to the news about Glazer's plans was lukewarm: United's shares rose by just over 5 per cent last week, valuing the company atabout \u00a3700m and suggesting there are some who doubt a formal bid will materialise. </p> <p>Both Commerzbank and Seymour Pierce, after all, have reportedly tried to find backers for a Glazer bid before - and neither, it seems, has succeeded. Glazer also has to secure the agreement of Irish racing barons John Magnier and JP McManus, who own Cubic Expression, United's biggest shareholder, with a 29 per cent stake. But sources close to the Glazer camp breezily dismiss all worries. The Irish pair stand to make \u00a370m profit on their United shares, and Glazer hopes they will prove amenable. He is confident, too, that JP Morgan will find enough lenders. </p> <p>Assuming so, how will he pay them back? Squeezing more revenues out of the club is a start. Glazer knows a thing or two about sports marketing and is well placed to sell United to the US, a key market. He could also seek unilateral TV deals between United and broadcasters, if he were prepared to infuriate other Premiership clubs by abandoning collective agreements. And if he were prepared to alienate fans even more, he could increase ticket prices at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Then there is the securitisation idea. Once in charge, Glazer could raise hundreds of millions almost instantly by mortgaging the next 10 or 20 years' worth of gate receipts. He could also borrow against future TV income, or the likely takings from stadium casinos, set to become a lucrative sideline for clubs. </p> <p>It's a good way to refinance one's debts, but there are risks. Leeds United and Leicester City both borrowed against future gate receipts, then found themselves relegated and struggling to meet their repayments. The chances of Manchester United dropping a division seem remote, but the club could easily fail to qualify for the European Champions League, missing out on TV royalties worth at least \u00a320m a year. </p> <p>Fearful fans have a vision of Glazer and his creditors taking money out of United, rather than putting it in. Optimists suggest that a securitisation would release vast sums for United to spend on players. On the other hand, Glazer could choose to pocket the money and pay off the debt using company profits - which could leave nothing for the transfer kitty. </p> <p>The likely reality is something in between. In America, Glazer has sometimes been parsimonious with the Buccaneers' biggest stars, but he has recognised the business sense of spending to achieve success, and propelled his unfashionable club to the 2003 Superbowl. Anything less here, and 'the Leprechaun' had better not show his face in Manchester.</p>",
  "The barbaric murder of Ken Bigley concludes another difficult and gruesome episode in the drawn out tragedy of Iraq and the wider Middle East. No less disturbing, in Egyptian Red Sea holiday resorts, 28 people (mostly Israeli tourists) died in a series of what are believed to be al-Qaeda-inspired attacks. Not only does Middle Eastern savage and brutal terrorism approach new levels of careless inhumanity and disrespect for human life, there is no evident end in sight. Once again, we have to ask fundamental questions about the wisdom of American and Israeli policy and, since Britain is so closely associated with it, whether Mr Blair is right to offer the continued and largely uncritical support of Britain. <p>George W Bush has been anxious from the beginning to depict America as engaged in a war against terror, with himself as a wartime President. In this framework, terrorism had to be dealt with rather as states take action against home-grown terrorists. This was true of Afghanistan; if the Taliban did not collaborate in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, then, it could be argued, there was an explicit case morally, strategically and in international law for invading the country that shielded him. </p> <p>The case for intervention in Iraq was always more finely balanced, and rested on the judgment that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, the capacity to make more and to use them and the readiness to support terrorist groups. As the Iraq Survey Group confirmed last week, Iraq had neither WMD nor the capacity to manufacture them, nor the immediate possibility of using them, even if Saddam nursed malevolent ambitions to do so. In the politics of hindsight, this plainly undermines a major plank of the pro-intervention case. But we do not operate with hindsight. The case for a pre-emptive intervention was that the evidence at the time - accepted among Western agencies including the French and German - pointed to Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction and had obstructed the implementation of key UN Resolutions. </p> <p>We now know that was untrue and that Iraq, by and large, had met its obligations. This does not mean that there were not strong grounds for believing Saddam posed a serious threat and for acting accordingly. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> New threat </b><br> </p> <p>Now we face a new threat. Fighting terrorism is about intelligent policing, successful international surveillance, monitoring flows of finance, dealing with arms smuggling and, most importantly, winning hearts and minds. Terrorists have an inbuilt disadvantage, since they should find it difficult to win the support of the vulnerable host population (though its support is crucial to their clandestine operations). The biggest mistake of the United States has been to wage war on terrorism as a war against states, undermining the key strategies it needs to beat terrorism on the ground. </p> <p>It is not enough simply to say that the world is better off without Saddam Hussein, though that is true. The balance sheet has to convince; negatives have to be set against the positives. On the negative side, the security position in Iraq, especially in the so-called Sunni triangle, looks intractably poor; Iraqi rule will have to rely heavily on American support to maintain order, which in turn will weaken its legitimacy. There are more terrorists in Iraq than before. And, the Israel-Palestine conflict looks far from resolution. With a two-state solution more elusive than ever, the Middle East is extremely volatile. </p> <p>On the positive side, most Iraqis welcome the removal of Saddam Hussein; civil society, whether measured in marriages or newspaper start-ups, is surprisingly vigorous. If the terrorism and security position could be stabilised, Iraq could find a way forward. </p> <p>For that, the US and Britain have to demonstrate how their long-term intentions square with an honourable settlement between Palestine and Israel. We are a long way from that. Every month that Sharon is indulged in the building of his fence and the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank is another month in which Palestinian resentment grows and more terrorists are recruited to hidden training camps. The most important contribution the next US President could make to world peace is to reverse the current stance on Israel. Our own Prime Minister should be insisting on this, both in private and publicly. </p> <p>One consequence of events in Iraq is that it is now harder to practise pre-emption. Any future British government would find it hard to win parliamentary support for a pre-emptive war, let alone public opinion. Winning support for a UN Resolution would be even harder. Yet in an era of globalisation and global terror the international legal position that what goes on within national borders is nobody else's business is not sustainable. As Mr Blair has argued, there needs to be change; but it will now be close to impossible to marshal support for such a change. The suspicion, rightly, would be that US neoconservatives could 'shock and awe' as they pleased. </p> <p>For the growth of an unhealthy US nationalism is another destabilising force today. Part of American public opinion and a section of its political establishment, is finding in Islam today a strategic enemy to substitute for the Soviet and Chinese communism of yesterday. Islam, though, is not a country. It is a religion and a culture which shares a common heritage with Christianity and Judaism, and whose global reach is as extensive. In Britain, we live side by side. We should not forget this when we hear others use the sloppy and dangerous language of a clash of civilisations. </p> <p>Ken Bigley was murdered by depraved terrorists - not depraved Islamic terrorists. The balancing act we must now perform is forensically to fight the war against terror, not against the countries and civilisation in which terrorism operates.</p>",
  "<p>Tourism bosses are hoping the interest in Alan Titchmarsh's TV series British Isles: A Natural History will boost English tourism this autumn. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Visit Britain said it has been working with the BBC to try and stimulate domestic tourism in England, which is down 2% on last year, according to latest figures from the organisation. </p> <p>Alan Titchmarsh said the sole intention of his series is to encourage people to experience first hand the natural history of the British Isles. </p> <p>\"Life is too much of a specta tor sport nowadays,\" he says, \"so we hope the series will encourage people to get out there, learn about wild flowers and wildlife and feel a part of the landscape.\" </p> <p>To complement the series, the BBC has produced a series of family-friendly Walks Through Time, so that viewers can follow some of the local routes featured in the 10-minute regional insight sections at the end of each programme.

  "<p><strong> The Flood</strong> <br>by David Maine <br>272pp, Canongate, \u00a312.99 </p> <p>Most first novels are eager to please, desperate to be noticed and embarrassingly autobiographical. David Maine's The Flood, longlisted for the Guardian's First Book award, is none of these: instead, he has written an elegant retelling of an ancient narrative, using the Biblical story of the flood to craft a moving meditation on families, faith and how people cope with global catastrophe. </p> <p>If you think you know this story already, but haven't actually read the relevant passages in Genesis, or read them a long time ago, you will be shocked by the callous details, the casual brutality, the sense of confusion, the terror of having to believe in a god who doesn't give a damn whether you like him or understand his motives. Maine adds to this feeling of novelty by basing his narrative on the Douay Bible, an English translation from the Latin published in 1609, and his characters have unfamiliar names: Noe, Sem and Cham rather than Noah, Shem and Ham. </p> <p>Maine refuses to modernise or sentimentalise the story. Noe is 600 years old, and the world has only existed for a millennium. A grouchy old man, Noe is brutal to his wife and, she thinks, can't even remember her name. One day, he hears a voice in his head, and pisses himself with terror. When the voice tells him to build a huge boat, he weeps, then gathers his family and orders them to start building. They think he's nuts, but don't dare disobey. Some giants arrive to help. A crowd gathers, jeering and laughing at Noe's hubris, although impressed by his ambition. \"It's not every day you see a ship growing in the desert.\" Someone offers to buy room for himself on the boat. Noe refuses, explaining that space could only be bought \"with a pure heart\". </p> <p>\"A stocky, tattooed man says, I'd rather barter for some of this. He hikes up the plump woman's tunic, and ruts her on the ground in front of the crowd. The men form a circle, tugging themselves.\" </p> <p>When the rain starts, the waters rise, and these same people are left outside the ark, begging to be allowed aboard. Staring down at them, Noe is jubilant. He stands on deck, jeering at the crowd: \"You can explain yourselves to Yahweh.\" When his daughter-in-law suggests that they rescue some of the children, Noe responds: \"We shall have children enough of our own.\" The world's population is swept away, and Noe rejoices: \"They were unclean in the sight of the Lord... Old is this world, a thousand years or more. It had grown heavy with filth and weary with sin. Now it has been scrubbed clean.\" </p> <p>Maine tells the story in eight voices. A narrator takes control of the chapters devoted to Noe, and the other characters - Noe's wife, three sons and three daughters-in-law - tell their own stories in their own voices. Some are loquacious; others terse and grumpy. Together, they create a wonderful description of a family coping with crisis. Confined to the boat, floating for weeks, they grow tired, bored, hungry and thoroughly irritated with one another. The sons bicker with their father; Noe's wife sighs, resigned, and does most of the work; the three daughters-in-law, sucked into this strange family, suddenly finding themselves the only fertile women on the planet, provide witty, caustic assessments of the situation and the other characters. These three women are never named in the Bible; Maine names them, gives them voices, and turns them into his most fascinating characters, tougher, more cunning and much more astute than any of the blunt, muscled men. </p> <p>Maine is an American who has lived in Morocco and Pakistan, and he writes with complete conviction about the desert, nomadic life and primitive communities. From the crumbling goats cheese to the psychology of the characters, everything feels right. What I most admired about The Flood is not just its honesty and authenticity, but Maine's refusal to give any easy answers or allow any simple readings. Again and again, there are enticing opportunities to draw metaphorical parallels with our own time. The oceans rise. Prophets decry the depravity of modern civilisation. With his impregnable faith, Noe might be Osama bin Laden or any of the other lunatics around the world who claim God is on their side. The flood might be the twin towers crashing down, destroying a decadent civilisation. </p> <p>Maine disdains all these metaphors, instead telling a story that cannot be read simply. No one knows Yahweh's reasons for making the flood; the innocent are swept aside along with the sinners; Noe puts an unfair curse on his grandson, sends his descendents in different directions across the Earth, and dies alone. These are the facts of the story, and they remain mysterious both to the characters and to the reader.</p>",
  "<p>Shirtlifters of the world - unite and take over! For years you've had to struggle against insults, name-calling, blinkered prejudice and institutionalised homophobia. But now all barriers are removed, and you too can be accepted by society - as the star of your own TV makeover show!</p> <p>Well, you can, provided you conform to the crudest possible stereotype: that you behave as though bums and doilies are your life's twin obsessions - limp-wristing your way around the screen and doing for homosexuals what the cartoon Hollywood Uncle Toms of the 1930s did for black people.</p> <p>See, I'd never actually watched <strong>Queer Eye For The Straight Guy UK</strong> (Thu, 9pm, Living) before now so, until recently, I was lucky. A single episode contains more desperate, unfunny camping than the human mind can withstand - enough to turn almost anyone into a knee-jerk homophobe. If you want to avoid automatically hurling a brick through the window of the next gay pub you walk past, you have to spend the entire broadcast reminding yourself that the vast majority of gay men don't perpetually run around screaming like six-year-old show-offs and talking about bums, just as the vast majority of black men don't spend their afternoons eating watermelons.</p> <p>If, however, you're already homophobic, it'll simply confirm your prejudices - and probably exacerbate them, like a Richard Littlejohn column made flesh.</p> <p>The original US version is by all accounts more palatable, and certainly more successful. In fact, it's already spawned a \"comedy\" imitator: <strong>Straight Plan For The Gay Man</strong> (Wed, 10pm, MTV), which demeans heterosexuals and homosexuals in equal measure.</p> <p>The premise: a group of straight \"lifestyle experts\" (actually actors) have a limited period to makeover a stereotypical queen, who must then pass for straight in a gruff hetero environment: in the first episode, he's got to spend a day working in - tee-hee - a meat-packing plant (geddit!?!).</p> <p>Yet for all its faults, Queer Eye isn't actually concerned with making straight men act gay, whereas making gay men act straight is the sole focus (and indeed, sole joke) of this tosh. Apparently, being \"straight\" is all about being an ignorant and insensitive slob, while being \"gay\" is all about owning pink cushions and squealing. The end result is half as funny as infanticide.</p> <p>As is <strong>The Jules And Lulu Show</strong> (Mon, midnight, ITV1), a jaw-dropping bit of late-night crud starring something called Julian Bennett (who's also in Queer Eye) and his dog (Lulu). It marks the point where high-pitched camp ceases to be merely tiresome and becomes downright psychotic.</p> <p>It works like this: Jules, who makes Graham Norton look like Conan the Barbarian, visits punters' homes and tears through them in search of chintz. And he really does tear through them - he overturns bins, smashes stuff up, rips underwear from drawers - it's like watching a teenage burglar going mental in an untended council flat. You half expect him to shit on their carpet for good measure.</p> <p>Along the way we're treated to an unremitting salvo of lame innuendo. For example, last week, the sight of a shuttlecock in a cupboard moved Jules to shriek: \"I love cocks!\"</p> <p>And that was the high point.</p> <p>Having selected the worst their home has to offer, it's outside to the bright pink garbage truck (I'm not making this up), where the homeowners have to guess which items Jules considers especially offensive, then toss them into the crushing machine. Which naturally is operated by Lulu the dog. No, really - they even throw in a shot of her paw pushing a big pink button. Later, for no apparent reason, Jules takes the winning couple to a charity shop, where they spend a few quid on tat while he pirouettes around like an animated, squeaking daisy.</p> <p>All in all, Queer As Folk feels a long way away: TV's returned to the dark days of Mr Humphries, but apparently that's OK because, this time round, it's \"ironic\".</p> <p>So mince, if you're glad to be gay. Mince if you're happy that way. Hey.</p>",
  "<p>When Fantine, the single mother deserted by her student lover and forced into prostitution, reflects in the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables that \"Life has killed the dream I dream\", she is echoing the experiences of all those who have seen their youthful hopes shattered by the tigers of the night. </p> <p>Dreams are the very stuff of musicals, arguably the most distinctive cultural icons of the 20th century. Because they demand so much more involvement than films, stage plays, visual arts or books - and because of those tunes that hang around so long in our heads - musicals have a rare power to move us, and to articulate our emotions. </p> <p>They also have a strong spiritual dimension and, as often as not, an essentially theological message - something that is as true for the commercial blockbusters as for the more arty and serious musicals which have only minority appeal. </p> <p>Les Mis\u00e9rables is a case in point. Perhaps the world's first global mega-show, seen by more than 60m people across the world, it has a libretto that reads like a liturgical text. There are 31 references to God, many in the context of prayers, eight mentions of heaven, six of Jesus, four of the soul, and explicit allusions to Calvary, the passion and the blood of Christ, the blood of the martyrs, sacrifice, salvation and sainthood. </p> <p>One of the show-stopping numbers, Bring Him Home, is essentially a prayer set to music; another, Empty Chairs At Empty Tables, has become an anthem for Aids victims. The show ends with part of the Lord's Prayer and a theological statement of some profundity: To love another person is to see the face of God. </p> <p>Songs from musicals are becoming the new hymns and folk anthems of our age. You'll Never Walk Alone (from Carousel) has found its way into several hymnbooks and is one of a number of show songs regularly requested at funerals. Others include My Heart Will Go On (from Titanic) and Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again (from Phantom Of The Opera). Common to all these songs are the themes of dreaming and yearning that have been so central to musical theatre, and derive, in part, from its largely Jewish origins. </p> <p>There has, in fact, been a marked change in the way that the dream theme is handled on the musical stage. In the 1940s and 1950s, at the height of the American domination of the genre, the message was that you needed only to Climb Ev'ry Mountain and your dream would come true, albeit with a little bit of struggle on the way. </p> <p>This optimistic theme, which continued on both sides of the Atlantic during the 1960s, was shattered by the show that marked the British takeover of musical theatre, Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar, with its disillusioned, angst-ridden Jesus. The only man who dreams here is Pontius Pilate, and his dream of Jesus comes back to haunt him. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber's subsequent shows have been characterised by a similar sense of unfulfilled yearning, not least the Beautiful Game, his collaboration with Ben Elton on sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Here, the dream is the simple, yet unattainable, one of \"an ordinary day\" without bombs and violence. But with the young men of the Belfast football team, both Catholic and Protestant, killed or imprisoned, their girlfriends are left singing of their shattered dream. </p> <p>In tackling the reality of shattered dreams, modern musicals, like Blood Brothers and Rent, articulate the contemporary human condition and reflect the mixture of pessimism and hedonism so prevalent among young people. Those of us seeking to reach out pastorally, spiritually and theologically would do well to study the songs of modern musicals, just as we would do well to re-connect with the idealism, communal values and hope-filled message of The Sound Of Music, Oklahoma! and Carousel. </p> <p>Ian Bradley is reader in practical theology and church history at St Andrews University.

  "The second presidential debate turned into a bare-knuckle battle for the White House last night, with George Bush and John Kerry dropping all pretence at civility as they savaged each other's records. <p>In an encounter that bristled with animosity, both candidates were on almost constant attack, setting out sharply opposing positions from Iraq to the economy, supreme court judges, abortion, and the environment.</p> <p>Last night's debate - the second of three encounters - caps a difficult week for Mr Bush, with opinion polls showing a tightening of the race for the White House after his lacklustre performance in last week's televised contest.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the CIA chief weapons inspector discredited the administration's rationale for the war on Iraq by saying that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Mr Bush also suffered a setback on the domestic front yesterday with the release of disappointing new job figures.</p> <p>An AP-Ipsos opinion poll published hours before the debate put Mr Kerry slightly ahead with 50% support compared to 46% for Mr Bush, raising the stakes of the encounter.</p> <p>For Mr Bush, under deepening pressure to make up for the shaky performance and angry scowls of last week's debate, the rematch was his chance to reassure Americans that he was of presidential material. Strategists for Mr Kerry were hoping for a forceful appearance to build on the momentum of their first contest.</p> <p>Unlike their previous encounter, last night's contest was a town hall debate, with voters posing questions that had been vetted earlier in the day by a moderator. The candidates paced across a vast red carpet, making occasional attempts to bond with the spectators, but mostly focussing their fury on each other.</p> <p>For campaign operatives, the intensity of last night's engagement was designed to give voters a clear idea of the differences between the candidates. </p> <p>\"The president's view of the world is black and white and there is no grey at all,\" said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Kerry campaign. \"John Kerry showed that he understands these very complicated issues and could negotiate them.\"</p> <p>Dan Bartlett, the White House communications chief, said: \"There were some key moments where I think the president highlighted in a very effective way the problems in Senator Kerry's record.\"</p> <p>In practical terms, that meant that Mr Kerry used his portion of the 90-minute encounter to drive home his argument that Mr Bush - because he won't acknowledge his mistakes on Iraq - is dangerously out of touch with reality.</p> <p>Mr Bush, in turn, focused on portraying Mr Kerry as a liberal who would raise taxes, and who was naive on national security.</p> <p>But neither candidate gave ground willingly.</p> <p>The first question, to Mr Kerry, echoed a Republican charge that has followed the Democratic challenger throughout the campaign: that he is wishy-washy, and tailors his opinions to the prevailing political winds.</p> <p>Mr Kerry immediately turned the question into an attack on Mr Bush's conduct of the war on Iraq. \"The president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq so he has turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception,\" he said.</p> <p>And so it went, with Mr Kerry and Mr Bush trading barbs on taxes, jobs, Osama bin Laden, and the deficit.</p> <p>When Mr Kerry promised he would not raise taxes on the middle classes, Mr Bush sneered: \"Of course he is going to raise your taxes.\"</p> <p>When Mr Bush unveiled his plan to trim a deficit that had ballooned under his watch, Mr Kerry replied: \"He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure.\" </p> <p>After the debate, Republican and Democratic strategists both predictably proclaimed outright victory, but neither side appeared overly confident, and the outcome was not as clear as in last week's debate.</p> <p>That contest was decided by Mr Bush's angry grimaces and evident impatience, broadcast to 65 million television viewers. </p> <p>By last night's debate, the president had his temper mostly under check, but his anger was evident as he scribbled frantically in a large notepad, or jumped out of his seat to answer questions. He also interrupted the moderator to angrily denounce Mr Kerry's charge that he had failed to build a coalition for the war in Iraq.</p> <p>\"You tell Tony Blair we're going alone,\" he said. \"Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone. Tell Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone. We've got 30 countries there.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush also appeared more in control of his material - unlike the first debate when he clung relentlessly to a few poll-tested slogans - although he faltered in his answers on the environment and the appointment of supreme court judges. He also provoked muffled laughter from the audience when he mentioned the \"internets\".</p>",
  "Israel's military intelligence chief yesterday blamed al-Qaida for the hotel bombings that killed at least 30 people, mostly Israeli tourists and Egyptian workers, in Sinai. <p>As rescue workers rooted through the wreckage of the Hilton hotel in Taba looking for more bodies believed to be buried in the rubble, Major General Aharon Zeevi-Farkash told an emergency session of Ariel Sharon's cabinet that the the main attack, a car bomb, bore all the hallmarks of groups linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>The blast sheared off 10 floors on one side of the building late on Thursday, a similar outrage to bombings against Israeli or Jewish targets in Tunis and the Kenyan city of Mombasa that were carried out by al-Qaida associates. </p> <p>Some people were killed in the blast, others crushed in the rubble and some fell to their deaths. Among those killed was at least one young child. </p> <p>Last night, bulldozers and sniffer dogs were scouring the area. \"We are still searching for life, we are digging almost by hand,\" Major General Yair Naveh told reporters. \"Until we reach the bottom of the hotel we may still find people.\" </p> <p>Shortly after the Taba attack, blasts at two backpacker hotels in Ras Shitan, further along the Red Sea coast, killed two people and wounded dozens. The bombings sent thousands of Israeli tourists streaming back home from the Sinai peninsula in the midst of a Jewish holiday. </p> <p>The intelligence assessment was backed by Israel's deputy defence minister, Ze'ev Boim, who said it was unlikely that Hamas or a similar Palestinian group was responsible. He said it appeared to be the work of \"international terror groups like al-Qaida or branches of it\". </p> <p>\"It is not the kind of attack that we know comes from Palestinian terror organisations,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Sharon did not mention how his government would respond if al-Qaida was responsible, but Israel was frustrated in its efforts to find members of a group that carried out the car bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombasa two years ago, killing 16 people, including three Israelis. </p> <p>The Israeli government was quick to make political capital out of the attack by drawing a connection between the Sinai bombings and Palestinian armed groups. It said Israel was the primary target of \"global terrorism\" motivated by hatred of democracy, peace and moderation. </p> <p>Mr Sharon said the Sinai attacks were primarily aimed at Jews who \"constitute a target for terrorist actions around the world\". </p> <p>\"Terrorism doesn't distinguish between countries or peoples,\" he said. \"Terrorism is global and its goal is to attack the free world; therefore, there can be no compromise with terrorism. It must be fought relentlessly, in every way possible.\" </p> <p>The Egyptian government spokesman, Magdy Rady, suggested the blasts were a response to the continuing Israeli military assault on northern Gaza which has left nearly 100 Palestinians dead, many of them children and other civilians. </p> <p>\"I think the explosions are very related to what is going on in Gaza,\" Mr Rady told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"We condemn these attacks, which have harmed many people. I think it is very probable that there is a link between these three explosions. It is very unlikely they happened by chance.\" </p> <p>Hamas in Gaza denied the group was involved by saying it attacked \"only in Palestine\". Tellingly, there were no celebratory announcements from Gaza City mosques or cheering on the streets in response to the bombings, of the kind that frequently greet the killing of Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>Israeli officials took the Hamas claim at face value, drawing parallels instead with a 2002 truck bomb outside a synagogue in Tunisia which killed 21 people and the bombing of a Kenyan hotel later that same year. </p> <p>Egypt's homegrown extremists were also viewed as unlikely suspects yesterday. They have been generally quiet since the massacre of 58 foreign tourists at Luxor in 1997. </p> <p>That attack provoked a backlash against the extremists by hitting tourism, on which hundreds of thousands of Egyptians depend for their livelihoods. Mass arrests also prompted many Egyptian militants to flee to Afghanistan - among them Ayman al-Zawahiri, who later became Osama bin Laden's deputy. </p> <p>Zawahiri, who had been the leader of the Egyptian Jihad group, and another Egyptian, Abu-Yasir Rifa'i Taha of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, were among the five signatories to Bin Laden's declaration of \"jihad against Jews and Crusaders\" issued in 1998. </p> <p>Even so, there were no hints from Egyptian officials yesterday that the Sinai attacks signalled a renewed campaign by either group. </p> <p>A month ago, the Israeli defence establishment issued a strong warning against travelling to Egypt, particularly the Sinai, because of a \"concrete worsening of the terror threat\". </p> <p>Security sources told the Israeli press that the warning was issued after the capture of six Egyptian students who infiltrated Israel intending to launch an attack. </p> <p>But its impact was diminished by several similar warnings in the past that proved false, and a belief among some Israelis that the security establishment routinely issues alerts so that it is not accused of failing to warn people if there is an attack. </p> <p>For the first few hours after the Hilton blast, the Egyptian government was in denial, blaming the explosion on gas bottles. But once the scale of the attack was apparent and two other bombings followed, it became impossible to maintain that position. </p> <p>Israeli officials speculated that the attack was not only aimed at driving Israeli tourists out of Egypt but at disrupting negotiations with Cairo over Mr Sharon's plan to pull Jewish settlers out of the Gaza strip.</p>",
  "The current home secretary is known for keeping a dog close to him, but it seems that there could be a canine solution to one of Mr Blunkett's biggest job problems. <p>A conference for pet-lovers in Glasgow this week was told of an American scheme in which young convicted killers, rapists and thieves were given a badly behaved dog to look after. The creators of Oregon's Project Pooch claim that, in 100 test-cases, all the men and pets stayed out of trouble. Perhaps Sherlock Holmes spoke truer than he knew in believing that the key to solving crime was a dog that didn't bark. </p> <p>This solution to hounding out crime emerged on the same day that one of the home secretary's rather less heart-warming schemes for reforming young thugs was given encouragement to continue: the high court threw out a challenge from three members of a gang of seven whose pictures were publicised in support of antisocial behaviour orders given to them for intimidating a north-west London community. The trio had claimed that publication of their faces breached their right to privacy. The police insist that distribution of the images reduced crime in the area by a fifth. </p> <p>These cases offer an intriguing coincidence of starkly different approaches to solving serious crime: mug-shot or mutt; name-and-shame or tame-and-shame. </p> <p>Apart from the reported 20% reduction in crime, the Asbo posters can easily be justified by the relief that will have been given to the people terrorised by the young thugs identified by the ad campaign. And while the group Liberty, which backed the three complainants, was doubtless using the legal argument most likely to succeed, it's hard to sympathise with a claim for privacy from men who invaded the space and lives of residents on a housing estate. </p> <p>Even so, the legal case against such stigmatising campaigns is weak - the practical objections are stronger: any reduction in crime needs to be balanced against possible unintended consequences. </p> <p> Six of the seven men identified on the posters were black. This detail invites either a shrug that this was a mere fact of the criminality being targeted, or a fear that pushing such leaflets through doors encourages fear of a particular race. And there is a risk of misidentification and a possibility of vigilante action. </p> <p>At a time when the authorities have been discouraging similar snap-and-shame exercises in the popular press (especially rogues' galleries of alleged paedophiles), it seems strange for the police to be distributing sheets of fear that face the same dangers. A likely effect of this week's high court ruling is that the populist press will feel encouraged to run their own Asbo galleries. </p> <p>The thought nags that the 20% crime-drop achieved by the Asbo-posters and the total makeovers claimed by Project Pooch both demonstrate not the triumph of criminology but the brilliance of statistics: there may be other factors involved. </p> <p>Yet, whatever doubts it might invite, we can see how Blunkett's favoured method might work. Instinct suggests that the members of the Asbo gangs would be unlikely to become less threatening if each was handed a psychologically damaged dog to look after. Indeed, anecdote and observation give the impression that many cheerfully reoffending criminals in Britain are already inseparable from their large, dysfunctional dogs. </p> <p>A believer in Project Pooch, however, would point out that the difference in those cases is that neither thug nor mutt is under any pressure to improve: the point of the scheme is that destinies of man and dog become linked. </p> <p>Proselytisers from Oregon claim that the system works because - when confronted with a disobedient animal - the criminals come to appreciate how irritating their own bad behaviour must be. Although this is simply an extension of the American theory that the use of pot-belly belts and shitting-and-screaming dolls will discourage schoolgirls from pregnancy, it seems fanciful in the canine application. An alternative - and far sadder - explanation of the Oregon dog effect is that these young men have never experienced loyalty, love or respect from any source. </p> <p>The success-rate claimed by the dog advocates of Oregon is so extraordinary that police forces here should probably grasp the lead, at least as an experiment. Even if it didn't work, there are far less obvious ways in which it could go wrong than the bigotry, vigilante attacks and misidentification that may result from the practice of printing pamphlets of local baddies. </p> <p>A Tory home secretary introduced the Dangerous Dogs Act in the hope of making the streets less frightening. It is proof of the complications of enforcing law and order that it now seems he should have simply handed each rottweiler to a young repeat offender. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>More than 1,000 internet sites have been shut down or forced into changes following a global sweep of scams and misleading advertising by consumer protection enforcers in 31 countries. </p> <p>The International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), an umbrella for the 31 organisations, including the UK's Office of Fair Trading, said at its London conference yesterday that its \"Too good to be true\" sweep to detect cross-border scams and fraudulent web adverts had netted a huge number of dodgy sites. </p> <p>The sweep resulted in 320 sites being closed or amended, 440 warning letters sent to traders, and five court enforceable undertakings. There are 307 websites still under investigation. And in the UK alone eight websites were closed, 27 forced to change site material, and 40 remain under investigation. </p> <p>The most common scam - 27% - was work at home schemes, which promise massive money for little effort but insist on big up-front payments to site promoters. </p> <p>Get-rich-quick schemes such as selling \"miracle slimming cures\", property dealing or acting as a loan broker made up 21%. Pyramid or multi-level marketing schemes, where you apparently make money by recruiting others you convince can make money doing the same, accounted for 18%. </p> <p>Other scams included: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> phoney lotteries where victims believe they have won a fortune on a draw that does not exist and where they have not bought a ticket. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> free prize offers which turn out to need a big outlay.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> educational qualification offers such as phoney PhDs. </p> <p>\"Come-ons\" included: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Business opportunity - \"make \u00a314,000 in a week without spending a penny\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \u00a32000+ per month for up to 10 hours per week </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 24 hours you could raise \u00a3198,000 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Make money from losing horses with \"Easy money from losers\". </p> <p>Many of the sites that were shut down were aimed at young people. </p> <p>Christine Wade, director of consumer regulation and enforcement at the OFT said: \"Almost half the websites targeted at children had unsuitable content. Goods on offer ranged from logos and ring tones to pictures and games.\" </p> <p>The consumer watchdogs are concerned that websites were not making the terms of contracts clear. </p> <p>\"In fact 31% did not give sufficient information on the prices being charged. A further 30% did not give clear information about necessary technical adjustments to the consumer's phone. In 22% no information was given on how to cancel agreements. </p> <p>\"And only 6% of the websites displayed an age limit for those entering it, while 46% had unsuitable content for the assumed age group, such as violence, erotic elements, alcohol and tobacco,\" Ms Wade said. </p> <p>\"We can see from the sweep that working with enforcement agencies in other countries has delivered real tangible results in tackling cross-border scams,\" she added.</p>",
  "<p>A controversial American internet firm is attracting thousands of Britons to \"wealth creating\" seminars using methods which have been investigated by the US Federal Trade Commission. </p> <p>The invitations have been sent to tens of thousands of people in the UK and Ireland - including many who want to know about online auctions such as eBay. </p> <p>The letter is an invite from iMergent, based in Utah, to attend free the \"Internet Marketing Conference\" which includes a \"Free Premier Dining Package\", normally at luxury hotels, where you will \"learn the secrets to (sic) creating wealth on the nternet in just 90 minutes\". But despite promising information on online auctions, this seminar does not teach better eBay usage. </p> <p>It does promise that attendees will receive a range of freebies, worth, it claims, \u00a389, including a \u00a325.99 business organiser and a \"delicious meal\" worth \u00a325 . </p> <p>It highlights case studies including: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Shoe salesman [who] quit his job and made as much as \u00a316,000 over a three-month period working from home.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Mother of four [who] realises \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 a day\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"New website owner [who] went from \u00a311,000 in '02 to \u00a3165,000 in '03 after attending conference.\" </p> <p>But these are not UK success stories. The same captions and photos appear on the firm's US website but with the cash in dollars. </p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority, which can vet UK mailshots, says it would require proof these earnings had been made in the UK's trading environment. Otherwise, it could be seen as misleading. </p> <p>Last week Jobs &amp; Money went to one of the seminars, at the Thistle Hotel, Westminster to see if we could make a fortune. The invitation promised a \"nationally renowned instructor\". This was Matthew Davis, from Utah, a self-styled \"successful entrepreneur, business owner and internet trainer.\" </p> <p>The seminar started with standard \"self-improvement\" routines such as shaking hands with neighbours, and discussing the \"four personal characteristics of success\". </p> <p>Matthew, who says he is not selling websites, tells us he represents storesonline, (an iMergent offshoot). Attendees learn that the secret to making an internet fortune is setting up a site that will feature high up on search engines such as Google. He lists clients who have made money by following this advice. </p> <p>He cites rapidcup.com, owned by Shane Lewis, a brother of iMergent co-founder Brendan Lewis. Rapidcup sells drug testing kits. </p> <p>But this week, Jobs &amp; Money entered \"drug testing kits\" into Google and it failed to make the top 30. He cites trixiestyle.com, a designer bracelet site, owned by his wife who, he says, \"loves hair, handbags and jewellery.\" Entering designer bracelets in Google does not find trixiestyle in the first three pages. </p> <p>Matthew quoted bullfx.com, a foreign exchange dealer, where he has a personal interest. Bullfx does not hit the top 50 on a \"forex trade\" search. </p> <p>He shows further examples of success such as pearljewels.com. Enter \"pearl jewels\" into Google and this site does come out top. But change that to \"pearl jewelry\" (US spelling) and its falls to 17th. </p> <p>Internet success, Matthew suggests, involves buying a site first and then finding a product to sell. But first you must go to the \"one day workshop\", costing \u00a32,995. But he says his company, storesonline, will \"invest in those who show excellence, and the four characteristics of success\". They can attend free. </p> <p>Well, not quite. You need a \u00a330 certificate (sold at the seminar). And what's the other catch? The firm will try to sell you \u00a31,900 a year websites to start your fortunes. </p> <p>He says the workshop will teach the \"keyword analysis tool\" that pushes sites up search engines. This, Matthew says is \"patented software owned by storesonline.\" </p> <p>But this is not a storesonline patent. An official iMergent document shows it owns no patents - the firm buys in software patented by others. </p> <p>There are currently 195 postings on iMergent and offshoots such as storesonline on US consumer complaint website Bad Business Bureau. </p> <p>Complaints include: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Attempts to sell multiple websites at presentations </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> High pressure follow-up calls after seminars </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Failure to offer \"cooling off periods\" or make refunds </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Claims it is easy to earn a lot even if you have no buying or selling experience. </p> <p>In April 2003, iMergent was issued with a \"cease and desist\" order in Washington state. Last April, the San Mateo, California District Attorney alleged \"unlawful business practice and making misleading statements at seminars\". Imergent paid $102,333 without admitting liability. </p> <p>The firm says in its annual report: \"We are aware of investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and government agencies ... we have been sued by customers who are dissatisfied with our product. We have generally been successful in addressing these concerns.\" </p> <p>It did not respond to a series of detailed questions we emailed. </p> <p>The \"\u00a325 lunch\" turned out to be a sandwich and a glass of bottled water. The ASA says it would need proof the meal cost \u00a325 and the plastic organiser retailed at \u00a325.99.</p> <p><strong>Case study: Making web trading pay</strong></p> <p>You don't have to pay \u00a32,995 at seminars to succeed as an internet trader. </p> <p>Dave Allwright, 47, from Plymouth is doing so well making money on the internet that he has given up his day job at a high street retailer. </p> <p>But he says you have to get your priorities right. \"I buy and sell antiques, stamps, and other collectibles using eBay. But the computer bit is really easy - eBay is self-explanatory. </p> <p>\"The tough side is knowing what moves, how to present it, and setting the price level you want. I've spent nearly 30 years dealing in collectible items so I know what's what.\" </p> <p>His first year sales hit \u00a313,000. Now he is on the way to \u00a322,000 (\"self sufficiency\" he says) with \u00a340,000 in sight for 2005. </p> <p>\"It's a real business, not a hobby. I keep accounts and pay tax,\" he adds. </p> <p>Part of his business plan involves diversity - items go up and down in popularity. And he's expanding overseas with a growing list of regular customers. </p> <p>His tips?<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Offer competitive shipping rates - don't try to profit from P&amp;P;<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Ensure items are securely packed; and<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Offer a full \"return if you don't like it\" warranty.</p>",
  "<p>If your career plan following graduation was to spend the next 40 years quietly pushing pens and counting paperclips in a dreary Whitehall department or small local council office, you've missed your chance. The public sector is finally shaking off its worthy-but-dull image, thanks to the thousands of graduates who can claim, genuinely, to be \"making a difference\".</p> <p>The \"public service ethos\" has always held some attraction. And in recent years, graduates have discovered that the public sector not only offers salaries and benefits comparable to what they might earn working for private companies, but that most public sector employers tend to offer more generous package flexible working arrangements.</p> <p>Now the battle has moved to challenging work. Not long ago the work of public servants was mocked for being unchanging and unchallenging. Today, few other sectors offer the wide range of challenges and high-profile projects as the public sector. Within a couple of years, graduates can be managing budgets running into millions of pounds, briefing government ministers and running programmes whose impact is felt across the country.</p> <p>Take a glance at the past few days' newspapers if you still need to be convinced of the public sector's reach:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Foreign Office organised a major conference on justice chaired by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Leicester city council opened the country's first \"sensory room\" for homeless families with children;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Department for Constitutional Affairs announced a database to help magistrates track down hard-to-find offenders who have defaulted on court penalties;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed details of research into the impacts of climate change on some key UK sectors; and</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Department of Health issued advice to worried arthritis sufferers following the withdrawal of the widely-used anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.</p> <p>In each case recent graduates will have been at the frontline, developing policies, managing projects and delivering services - graduates like Lucy Durling, Laxmi Rao and Jenny Hodgson.</p> <p><strong>Lucy Durling, NHS</strong></p> <p>\"I've always wanted to work in health promotion, so when I graduated from Leicester with a degree in psychology in 2001, I considered working in the private sector in fitness centres.</p> <p>\"But there's such a strong link between deprivation and health that I realised that if I really wanted to deliver a service to people, the place to do it was the public sector.</p> <p>\"I joined the NHS management training scheme which is very broad, based around different placements once you've done a three month orientation.

We're piloting it at two leisure centres in Nottingham city centre but hoping to role it out on a larger scale eventually.</p> <p>\"The rest of the week I work as a healthy heart development specialist in the area surrounding Nottingham, developing a project to prevent heart conditions, encourage healthy eating and promote cardiac rehab.</p> <p>We're at the forefront of this work and it involves a great deal of experimentation.</p> <p>\"I wasn't sure how to get into this kind of work.

With a private sector scheme there's a danger you can end up doing two years in the same place.</p> <p>\"I applied direct to the Highways Agency Graduate Leadership Development scheme because I liked the emphasis on leadership. The first placement I spent in human resources, working on graduate recruitment.</p> <p>\"I'm now on my second placement, and part of the Network Strategy Team which aims to reduce congestion and improve road safety. I'm working on a study of 'high occupancy vehicle lanes' to see if we can speed up journeys by creating lanes for vehicles with two or more passengers. There are a couple of lanes like this in the UK already, but we're looking to introduce them to motorways. We're piloting it at four sites and our consultants will be publishing a report in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>\"To be honest I was surprised to be given a project of this size so early on - I've been project managing the consultants, briefing ministers and answering letters from the public.

  "He has spent his life documenting the struggles of the poor and excluded, in films ranging from Cathy Come Home to last month's Ae Fond Kiss. <p>Now Ken Loach is taking on the might of Canary Wharf in a row that mirrors his acclaimed 1998 film Bread and Roses, fighting for the rights of cleaners in the lucrative financial institutions on the Docklands estate. </p> <p>The film-maker will premiere the director's cut of Bread and Roses in London next Thursday to promote a campaign to improve cleaners' pay and conditions. </p> <p>But plans to march on the Canary Wharf estate the next day have been axed after its owners applied for an injunction to ban the protest, pointing out that it was privately owned and there were no public access rights. </p> <p>The T&amp;G called off the demonstration after the Canary Wharf Group threatened to go to the high court to stop the march, claiming it would \"severely compromise the security of the estate\". </p> <p>Bread and Roses celebrated the Justice for Janitors campaign in the US, which won decent wages and working conditions for thousands of low-paid workers. It also helped to inspire the current campaign by the Transport and General Workers Union and the East London Communities Organisation (Telco). </p> <p>\"This is the first of what will be a long war with many battles,\" Loach said yesterday, adding that he had planned to join the march. \"I feel connected to this issue after Bread and Roses. I hope the employers will be forced to pay them a living wage and give them proper contracts.\" </p> <p>He said: \"The situation in Los Angeles was very similar. People are very vulnerable, but office cleaners there really did get organised and made sure offices couldn't function unless they were treated fairly. </p> <p>\"I would have thought everyone would think this is a very just cause.\" </p> <p>The union says workers earn as little as \u00a35.20 an hour, with the statutory minimum of 12 days' holiday and eight public holidays a year and no sick pay or pensions. </p> <p>It argues that a minimum living wage in London would be \u00a36.70 an hour, and believes that all workers should receive sick pay, pensions and greater holiday entitlement. </p> <p>Neither the Canary Wharf Group nor companies based on the estate employ the cleaners directly. But the union argues that companies should ensure all workers receive a living wage. </p> <p>\"The people ultimately responsible are those who deal out the contracts. The buck stops there,\" said Loach. </p> <p>The campaign has already had some success. Last week Mitie Cleaning, which manages workers at the law firm Clifford Chance, agreed to raise wages and holiday entitlement. In June ISS, a multinational cleaning company which has cleaning contracts for Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, agreed to recognise the T&amp;G. </p> <p>In a statement the Canary Wharf Group said yesterday: \"The whole of the Canary Wharf estate is privately owned and there are no rights of access over it which are enforceable by the public. Canary Wharf Group is very conscious of its relationship and obligations to its tenants and is concerned with the effect of any demonstration on private property. We believe the event will severely compromise the safety and security of the estate.\" </p> <p>It added: \"This decision does not reflect any view of Canary Wharf Group on the merits of this march.\" But police had raised no concerns about the demonstration, which was arranged to coincide with the European Social Forum (ESF), a four-day global justice conference starting on Thursday. </p> <p>Hundreds of leaflets advertising the event had been distributed across Europe prior to cancellation of the march. </p> <p>The Guardian is media partner of the ESF, which is expected to attract at least 20,000 delegates from trade unions, charities and community groups across Europe.</p>",
  "<p>It's hell. It takes it all out of you. It nearly kills you ... It is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done - so I do it.\" Who said this? Matthew Pinsent after winning his fourth rowing gold medal in Athens this summer? Kelly Holmes after struggling back from injury to add the 800m to her 1500m gold? Roger Federer after retaining his Wimbledon title? Lance Armstrong after winning his sixth Tour de France? Jonny Wilkinson on his slow fight-back to form after surgery to his shoulder? The answer is Ernest Hemingway, talking about the rigours of writing world-beating, hairy-chested fiction, and his commitment to going mano-a-mano with a Remington typewriter, a Superman complex and a coldly perspiring demi-litre of Pastis every morning. </p> <p>\"See him now in his caf\u00e9,\" as Alfred Kazin described Hemingway's self-mythologising self-portrait in Paris in the 1920s, \"with his sweatshirt under his shirt, his blue-backed notebook to write in, his two pencils and his little pencil sharpener ... You think this is less of an American fable than Huck Finn on a raft, Ben Franklin waiting for his kite to be hit by lightning?\" </p> <p>His quota of words completed for the day, \"Papa\" was off rolling his shoulders and shadow-boxing round the Deux Magots and La Closerie des Lilas, shouting up his reputation as an outstanding pitcher and hitter on the high-school baseball team, a legendary college footballing ace, to anybody who was willing to listen. </p> <p>The truth, of course, was that Hemingway was nobody's first pick to be on their side. He was a shy boy, hampered by imperfect eyesight, overweight and awkwardly stumbling over his outsized feet. As a ballplayer, his brother Leicester once said, Ernest was a pretty studious reader. His mother used to find him poring over a book, and propose that he go out to play some baseball. \"Aw, mother,\" Ernest would wail, \"I pitch like a hen.\" </p> <p>For all this, and maybe because of it, no major American writer devoted more time and energy to the world of sport. One of his many biographers, Scott Donaldson, has noted that sports are referred to in 43 of Hemingway's first 49 stories, and in a number of cases (\"Big Two-Hearted River\", \"The Undefeated\", \"My Old Man\") are the meat of them. His journalism and correspondence frequently focused on bull-fighting, hunting, and fishing, as did three of his books - Death in the Afternoon, Green Hills of Africa, and The Old Man and the Sea. All he wanted, Hemingway wrote to Lillian Ross in May 1950, was to be champion of the world. </p> <p>He also wanted, like Walt Whitman and many of Hemingway's heirs in contemporary American letters, to be \"regarded as one of the roughs\". So he dined out on apocryphal stories about running away from home, about brawls in and out of the ring, about the tough south-side Chicago neighbourhoods he had frequented. But even in the days when he remained an unpublished writer, not everybody bought it. \"You are to remember that in Paris,\" Ford Madox Ford wrote at the end of that \"lost decade\", the 1920s, \"I have lived for years buried under mountains of middle-westerners who there find it necessary to assume the aspects, voices, accents and behaviours of cowboys crossed with liberal strains of prize-fighters and old-time Bowery toughs.\" </p> <p>In no other novelist was the division between the thinking man and the doing man, the writer and the sportsman, more pronounced than in Hemingway. As Donaldson writes in By Force of Will (1977), Hemingway was \"a man deeply divided against himself, with the most conspicuous split separating the writer, worker and man of feeling on the one hand, from the adventurer, sportsman and man of action on the other\". </p> <p>More than 40 years after Hemingway's death, it is a fracture that some of America's most prominent writers - John Updike, Philip Roth, Don DeLillo, Richard Ford - still feel impelled to try to heal in their fiction. David Foster Wallace, who once described himself as a \"near-great\" tennis junior, took it as the starting point for Infinite Jest (1996) and, at 1,079 pages, produced undisputedly the longest novel about tennis ever written. </p> <p>One of its earliest set-pieces features the young Enfield Tennis Academy prodigy, Hal Cadenza, up for interview by the admissions panel at the University of Arizona, where Wallace himself was a student. The deans on the panel are suspicious of Hal because of an apparent inconsistency between some verbal test scores that have shown him to be \"subnormal\", and the impossible braininess of his essays. It's the braininess that worries them rather than the dumbness which, on a primarily athletics-oriented campus, can be viewed as a \"revenue-raising asset\". </p> <p>As a 10-year-old, Hal's father had been lectured on the futility of book-learning by his own father: \"Those thoughts in your mind are just the sound of your head revving, and head is still just body, Jim.\" Revving heads (mainly Wallace's), and the ponk of tennis balls reverberate throughout Infinite Jest . As an exercise in the inversion of the old Hemingway clich\u00e9 - rather than the writer who thinks he's lean and mean and a bit of a bruiser, the athlete who is a brain - it is berserkly, and sometimes brilliantly, cerebral. </p> <p>Infinite Jest's most obvious antecedents are the postmodern metafictions of John Barth, Thomas Pynchon and Robert Coover, in particular Coover's The Universal Baseball Association (1968). DeLillo and Roth wrote early, loosely experimental novels that also dealt in a surreal-satirical way with sport. Both DeLillo's End Zone (1972), which was about gridiron football and nuclear fission, and The Great American Novel (1973), which saw Roth cutting loose in the tale of America's only homeless big-league baseball team, were the antithesis of everything the virulently anti-abstractionist Hemingway thought good writing should be. \"Artist, art, artistic!\" he was once heard to rant. \"Can't we ever hear the last of that stuff?\" </p> <p>As its title indicates, The Great American Novel was intended as a commentary on the fervid competition between Roth, Norman Mailer, Bernard Malamud and their contemporaries in the 50s and 60s. An extended scat on winning - \"Oh, you really can't say enough good things about it ... Win hands down, win going away, win by a landslide, win by accident - you just can't beat it, however you slice it. Winning is the tops\" - is obviously meant to be a satirical take on the infamous letter Papa sent to the publisher Charles Scribner in 1949: \"Tried for Mr Turgenieff first and it wasn't too hard. Tried for Mr Maupassant and it took four of the best stories to beat him . ... Mr Henry James I would just thumb him once the first time he grabbed then hit him once where he had no balls.\" </p> <p>Roth hammers home the point by having \"Hemingway\" send a telegraph message in The Great American Novel: \"To Messrs Hawthorne, Melville, Twain and James, in care of the Department of Literatoor, Vassar College, New York. Dear Illustrious Dead: The Great American Novelist, c'est moi. Signed, Papa.\" </p> <p>The irony here is that The Great American Novel is as testosterone-charged and swaggeringly, preposterously ambitious as any of the pumped-up works by rival writers that it tries to take down. Al Alvarez touched on a further irony in these pages a few weeks ago. Writing about Roth's scandalous success with Portnoy's Complaint , Alvarez noted that \"when it was published in 1969 it seemed to epitomise the anarchic spirit of the decade. Maybe it did, but the author himself (b.1933) was a product of the 1950s, the last generation of well-behaved, sternly educated children who believed in high culture and high principles ... Portnoy was considered outrageous when it appeared, but the real outrage was Roth's and he was outraged because he couldn't help being a good boy however much he yearned to be bad.\" </p> <p>DeLillo (b.1933) and Updike (b.1932) also came of age in the clean-cut 50s; Richard Ford was born a decade later (1944) but he too grew up through the jutting-jawed Eisenhower years. With Roth and Wallace, these writers have produced some of the landmark American novels of recent times. And Independence Day (Ford), Underworld (DeLillo), American Pastoral (Roth), Infinite Jest and even Updike's Rabbit tetralogy are all, in one way or another and to greater or lesser degrees, about sport. </p> <p>Images of sportsmen and sportswomen have become swarmingly ubiquitous in the electronic society of the image in which we live. It is sports stars, we are told, rather than Hollywood or music industry figures, who can swing next month's election for George W Bush. At every campaign stop-over, local baseball heroes and National Football League Hall of Famers are wheeled out to endorse the president with a sporting metaphor: \"He's made the right calls time and again and he's got the scorecard to prove it!\" Cue high-fives, pseudo-military salutes and manly bear-hugs. </p> <p>But only 80 years ago even baseball, now regarded as the American national pastime, was considered to be slightly disreputable. In many ways it took a writer, Ring Lardner, in his daily newspaper column and, later, his phenomenally popular syndicated short stories, to make it respectable. Lardner wrote his baseball column for five years in Chicago between 1908 and 1913, and continued to cover big games until the early 20s, though he became somewhat disillusioned after the so-called Black Sox scandal of 1919, when the Chicago team contrived with a betting syndicate to lose the World Series. The legendary \"fix\" has been immortalised by a reference to it in The Great Gatsby (1925); Scott Fitzgerald and Lardner had become friends and drinking partners - two of America's \"deepest drinkers\", Lardner liked to joke - while living in Great Neck, Long Island, in 1923, and Fitzgerald introduced Lardner to his (and Hemingway's) editor, Maxwell Perkins. But they never succeeded in persuading Lardner to write a novel, or, for that matter, as David Lodge has written, \"to put his stories before the public with the dignity appropriate to a modern literary master\". </p> <p>Writing in 1925 in praise of Lardner's experiments with the American vernacular, Virginia Woolf concluded that \"it is no coincidence that the best of Mr Lardner's stories are about games, for one may guess that Mr Lardner's interest in games has solved one of the most difficult problems of the American writer; it has given him a clue, a centre, a meeting place for the diverse activities of people whom a vast continent isolates, whom no tradition controls. Games give him what society gives his English brother.\" </p> <p>Lardner died of TB brought on by excessive drinking in 1933, aged 48, and when Fitzgerald wrote his friend's obituary, he allowed his frustration to show. He traced Lardner's \"cynical attitude towards his work\" back to his youthful infatuation with baseball: \"During those years, when most men of promise achieve an adult education, if only in the school of war, Ring moved in the company of a few dozen illiterates playing a boy's game. A boy's game, with no more possibilities in it than a boy could master, a game bounded by walls which kept out novelty or danger, change or adventure.\" </p> <p>Lardner came from a prosperous mid-western farming family, and enjoyed a comfortable, almost idyllic upbringing. He trained his ear for bar-room slang and lively gutter language travelling with the \"illiterates\" of the White Sox baseball team. Spectator sports, although still in their infancy, were a ready route out of poverty, then as now, for new Americans, and locker rooms became a forcing ground for the improvised, hybridised kind of English that Lardner started putting into his stories and Hemingway wasn't alone in picking up on. He inscribed a copy of Death in the Afternoon (1932), \"To Ring Lardner, from his early imitator and always admirer\". But this didn't stop Papa rounding on the multitude of impersonators of his early, plain-spoken fictions. \"You bastards have stolen my prose style\", Roth has him explode in The Great American Novel . \"Every shithead sportswriter in America has stolen my style and then gone and fucked it up so bad that I can't even use it anymore without becoming sick to my stomach.\" </p> <p>In an essay for the New York Times 40 years ago, the British football writer Brian Glanville (author of the football novel The Rise of Gerry Logan) joined Orwell in comparing the rich American vernacular with the thin gruel of standard English and \"the deadness of middle-class speech\". Cricket, Glanville noted, \"a haven for the belletrist and the literary romantic, has yet to produce a single piece of serious fiction about the professional game\", and that remains the case today. The rough world of northern Rugby League, on the other hand, at the time Glanville was writing, had just produced David Storey's This Sporting Life (1960), a novel by a miner's son who became an art student, and travelled north every weekend to play for Leeds Reserves. It had an authenticity, Glanville believed, which was guaranteed by Storey's own experience; no stranger to the Rugby League milieu and Yorkshire mining background could have hoped to write it. </p> <p>By putting the narrator of his breakthrough novel The Sportswriter (1986) into the trade of the title, Ford encouraged readers of his earlier, \"dirty realist\" stories to expect a book fetid with the smells of wintergreen and embrocation and astringent. And though, in the course of the novel, Frank Bascombe does travel to Detroit to profile a former star footballer who is now a paraplegic, and visits the offices of the magazine that employs him in New York, The Sportswriter is a novel that stays resolutely in anti-heroic mode. It is virtually all interior monologue; a (frequently very funny) meditation on the routine and the mundane, with numerous digressions on what Bascombe has learned about life-through-sport. \"Athletes, by and large, are people who are happy to let their actions speak for them, happy to be what they do. As a result, when you talk to an athlete, as I do all the time ...he's never likely to feel the least bit divided, or alienated, or one ounce of existential dread.\" </p> <p>This patent untruth - which in many ways is the subject of Roth's American Pastoral, the story of an all-American, sun-blessed athlete, patriotic, dutiful, simple-seeming, bland as butter, who turns out to be wracked by uninmaginable existential dread - is reiterated by DeLillo in End Zone: \"Football players are simple folk. Whatever complexities, whatever dark politics of the human mind, the heart - the football player travels the straightest of lines. His thoughts are wholesomely commonplace, his actions uncomplicated by history, enigma, holocaust or dream.\" </p> <p>By the time of Independence Day (1995), Ford's follow-up novel, his sportswriter Bascombe has moved on to become a buyer and seller of property and father of an estranged, violently delinquent son. To try to heal their relationship, and acting on something he has said in the earlier novel, that \"talking about sport ... is a pretty innocent part of people, and talking has the effect of bringing us all together\", Bascombe sets out with Paul on a \"hombre-to-hombre\" tour of all the sporting Halls of Fame they can fit into the July 4 weekend. The trip ends in near-disaster when Paul beans himself - maybe accidentally, maybe not - by putting his head in the way of a ball being pelted out of a pitching machine in Cooperstown, NY. </p> <p>Ford, who spent the first 18 years of his life \"unlettered as a porch monkey\", is a self-identified sports nut. In \"The Three Kings\", an appreciation of Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald, he wrote that \"Some boys, alas, do not come to serious reading, nor God knows to serious writing, precisely like hounds to round steak. Though, then again, special boys sometimes do.\" </p> <p>Ford is a southerner, from Jackson, Mississippi. Updike, Roth and DeLillo are all from the north-eastern United States. Updike and Roth have described their home neighbourhoods so insistently, and occasionally rapturously, over the years that their work contains pictures of Shillington, Pennsylvania and the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey, so complete that, as Joyce once remarked of Dublin, \"if the city one day suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book\". </p> <p>DeLillo grew up in the Bronx, but it wasn't until Underworld (1997), his 11th novel, that he approached material which was clearly autobiographical. In the closing section, set in the early 1950s, Nick Shay, the main protagonist, is depicted as a rough-tongued delinquent, helling around with girls and drink and the local poolroom hoodlums. But the close reader may suspect that it is Nick's studious, chess-playing brother who offers a truer picture of the authorial alter-ego. </p> <p>Little Matty Shay is \"pale with an indoor passion\", like Dale, the computer nerd in Updike's Roger's Version . (Like, in fact, Seldon Wishnow, the little loser who lives downstairs from the Roths in The Plot Against America . Seldon throws a ball like a girl; all he likes to do is play chess. He wants to be a friend of Philip's and walk to school with him; Philip can't wait to see the back of him.) </p> <p>Updike has written marvellously about sport, especially golf, in articles and stories. But until he was an adult, the series of afflictions he enumerates in Self-Consciousness (1989) - psoriasis, asthma, claustrophobia, hydrophobia, arachnophobia, insomnia, poor teeth, a tendency to choke and a spectacular stammer - prevented him having much of a sporting life. The four Rabbit novels, published at intervals of roughly a decade between 1960 and 1990, are of course about a great deal more than Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom's regret about his finest hour as a star of the college basketball team being way behind him: they are about race and terrorist attack, the legacy of Vietnam, the sexual revolution, the disintegration of the American landscape and the apparently unstoppable, runaway expansion of what Roth has called \"the indigenous American berserk\". </p> <p>But the 1,500 pages of the tetralogy begin and end with Harry doing what he has always done when he wants to feel most within himself: sneakered-up, running and leaping with a ball. \"That tan pebbled roundness, the smooth seams between, the little circlet for taking the air valve.\" It is Harry's last conscious moment before a heart-attack kills him on-court. \"A big pebbled ball that wants to fly.\" </p> <p>\"What is it with ballplayers?\" Martin Amis wonders in Money (1985), as the crapulous John Self is being humiliated in a game of tennis by an athletic Hollywood type. \"What is it about roundness that they understand better than we do? The world is round. They understand that too.\" </p> <p>A close, almost forensic, even fetishistic attention to the plastic fact of the ball - its size, weight, consistency, colour, texture, resiliency and liveliness - is a striking feature of all these books, all written of course by men. Ford does it in Independence Day (a baseball is the object that has almost killed Bascombe's son). Wallace does it with \"a dirty green dead old\" Slazenger in Infinite Jest: \"Perfectly round. Even distribution of mass. But empty inside ... Nothing in there but evacuated air that smells like a kind of rubber hell.\" Roth does it over several pages in The Great American Novel, and then again over several more pages, a few chapters further on, but takes 30 years to tell us, in American Pastoral , what he might have been getting at: that the \"Moby Dick-coloured\" balls in the museum showcase are nostalgic remnants of an era when \"orderliness [was] a natural condition, daily living a simple story tangibly unfolding, a deeply unagitating story, the fluctuations predictable, the combat containable, the surprises satisfying\". </p> <p>In Mao II , DeLillo's writer-hero Bill Gray lies awake at night \"going down the batting order of the 1938 Cleveland Indians\": \"I do batting orders in my head all the time. And I've been trying to write toward that kind of innocence ever since ... There hasn't been a moment since those days when I've felt nearly so good.\" </p> <p> Underworld , the book DeLillo wrote after Mao II , has been called America's great love song to baseball. In the novel, collectors compete to possess the ball that won a legendary game played in New York in 1951. They want to possess the ball - \"this little spheroid fact\" - so that they can possess a moment pre-dating television when people \"did something great just by being there ... - decades ago when things were not replayed and worn out and run down and used up before midnight of the first day\". The ball has come into Nick Shay's keeping, at a price: $34,500. He keeps it on a bookshelf in the bedroom, \"wedged in a corner between straight-up books and slanted books, tented under books, unceremoniously\". On nights he can't sleep, he weighs the ball in his hand, examining the seams, the rough spots and stains on the horsehide. \"This is the thing that will pulse in his brain come old age and double vision and dizzy spells - the surge sensation, the leap of people already standing, that bolt of noise and joy when the ball went in.\" </p> <p>There is an echo of Fitzgerald here, and Tom Buchanan in Gatsby, \"who would drift on forever, seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game\". An echo of Fitzgerald himself who, until the end of his life, would mingle with the crowds in the big university stadia and eventually died of a heart attack annotating an article in the Princeton Alumni Weekly. In his copy of the magazine, a pencil line still runs wildly down a page of a story about football. </p> <p>Part of the lure of Ivy League matches for Fitzgerald was that, in their liveries and traditions, they seemed timeless. \"Baseball's time is seamless and invisible,\" the game's chief laureate, Roger Angell, has written, \"a bubble within which players move at exactly the same pace and rhythms as all their predecessors. This is the way the game was played in our youth, and in our fathers' youth, and even back then - back in the country days - there must have been the feeling that time could be stopped.\" </p> <p>In this way it's like reading; it's like writing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Gordon Burn's book about George Best will be published by Faber and Faber next year.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Heroes: Saviours, Traitors and Supermen</strong><br>by Lucy Hughes-Hallett<br> 624pp, Fourth Estate, \u00a325 </p> <p>\"The history of the world is the biography of great men,\" declared Thomas Carlyle in his Lectures on Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1840). Carlyle tried to prove his point by giving rhapsodic accounts of the lives and influence of a bizarre mix of prophets, poets and rulers (Odin, Mohammed, Dante, Shakespeare, Luther, Burns, Johnson, Rousseau, Cromwell and Napoleon), whom he saw as the motors of human history. Most of us would find it pretty difficult now to call someone \"my hero\" without putting on the voice of Popeye's Olive Oyl and doing a lot of batting of our eyelids to show we don't really mean what we're saying. Democracies have problems with heroes, and democracies in which most people believe that human character is principally fashioned by environment find it hard to believe in the existence of, let alone to worship, the kind of overwhelming natural brilliance that Carlyle found in his heroes. </p> <p>Lucy Hughes-Hallett knows all this and treads a canny line in constructing her new canon of heroes to supplant Carlyle's. She offers short and sparky biographies of eight men, all of whom had troubled relations with their political rulers: Achilles (for Homer still the best of the Achaeans despite his rebelliousness), Alcibiades (the charismatic and deceitful freelance Athenian general), Cato (the priggish defender of the Roman Republic against the rise of Julius Caesar), El Cid (the glamorous mercenary who resisted Muslim incursions into Spain), Francis Drake (the pirate-cum-imperial voyager), Wallenstein (the one-man military-industrial complex who led the imperial army in the thirty years war), Garibaldi (the engagingly lecherous, swashbuckling liberator of Italy) and finally, and all too briefly, the wily Odysseus. </p> <p>Her selection of heroes is skewed towards military leaders: there is no Christ or Sir Thomas More to alleviate the swashing of buckles, or to indicate that heroes can be people of principle rather than simple men of action. The closest she comes to a patient and resistant hero is Cato, who withstood many trials in his vain attempt to protect the Roman Republic, including being pelted with dung. But she tells the life stories of all these men (and yes, they are all hairy-chested blokes) with vivacity and wit. Although she does not believe with Carlyle that the biographies of Great Men make history happen, she is extremely good at using the events of her heroes' lives to evoke a larger swath of historical events. The chapter on Wallenstein does as much as anyone could in the space to make the thirty years war comprehensible and interesting, and people who want to know a bit about fifth-century BC Athens or about the unification of Italy could do a lot worse than read the chapters on Alcibiades and Garibaldi. </p> <p>She also has a sharp eye for the kind of anecdote that can bring history to life. Apparently one Spaniard got so carried away showing what he would do to Francis Drake that he shot a bystander dead. And there is a glorious cameo appearance by the Irishman John Peard, who, when asked why he was fighting with Garibaldi (in his tweeds), declared that he respected Italian independence, \"but I am also very fond of shooting\". He was, apparently, sometimes taken for Garibaldi himself, and the ladies all swooned over him in place of the real hero. The chapter on Garibaldi also almost offers the book's only female hero: his first wife Anita stood by him while bullets whistled through her hat, and was bowled over not only by him but also by cannon-balls. They had met in South America, where Garibaldi had said \"You must be mine\" (as he remarks \"my impudence was magnetic\"), and she was. He tried more or less the same line with his second wife (Anita could not stick the life of a Garibaldina for long, and died in 1849). He was less lucky second time around: the beautiful young Giuseppina Raimondi, it transpired, had had a sexual career almost as colourful as Garibaldi's own before their marriage. Unfortunately Garibaldi learnt about this immediately after the wedding and, being a hero with traditional male beliefs about female promiscuity, never spoke to her again. </p> <p>It's a witty and readable book, but it does have problems with its argument. The basic idea is that the particular kind of heroes that Hughes-Hallett is interested in are men of (in her excellent phrase) \"seditionary greatness\". They're too big, too wild, too dangerous. They fight at one moment for their leader or regime, and then turn against them - indeed several of them, including El Cid and Alcibiades, turn and turn about in their political allegiances. A final chapter introduces a more sinister note: it shows how D'Annunzio, Mussolini and Hitler manipulated hero-worship to suit their own ends, and argues that by contrast Leopold Bloom, the humdrum democratic Odyssean hero of James Joyce's Ulysses, is far more appealing to our age. As Hughes-Hallett puts it, with a distinct hint of a wrist-slap, hero-worship \"allows worshippers to abnegate responsibility, looking to the great man for salvation or for fulfilment that they should more properly be working to accomplish for themselves\". So don't sit there watching replays of Beckham's free kicks; get out there and kick a ball yourself until you can bend it with the best. </p> <p>As well as this thoroughly decent strand of liberal-democratic horror at what a hero can do to a state and at what hero-worship can do to the soul, this book also has a strong thread of soft-core Nietzschean wonder at the superman running through it. These two strands don't sit comfortably together, and it is often not clear whether we're being invited to wonder at the natural charisma of heroic individuals or to deplore the ruses by which heroes trick people into admiring them. </p> <p>To make up for this problem with her argument, Hughes-Hallett has to throw in a heavy dose of comparisons between her subjects. Sometimes the effect is a bit like the first-century Greek historian Plutarch, whose Parallel Lives compared the actions of a famous Roman with those of an equally famous Greek counterpart. But most of the time the comparisons stand in for a clear argument about what really might be good or bad about heroes. We are told far too often that \"As Cato\" stood up for the state, \"so\" Garibaldi, or Drake, or Alcibiades or whoever did the same; or \"As Achilles\" sulked in his tent \"so Wallenstein\" retired to his private chamber to indulge in dark thoughts about the emperor. There are moments when these comparisons are so strained that they recall dear old Fluellen in Shakespeare's Henry V , who tries to prove that Henry V (a fellow Welshman) is as heroic as Alexander the Great, but can't muster anything much that they have in common except \"there is a River in Macedon, and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth... and there is salmons in both\". </p> <p>If Hughes-Hallett is finally unclear about whether she loves or loathes her heroes, or what they all have in common, this is not simply her fault. We all have a problem with heroes. We want them so badly that we keep inventing new ones, and yet our political culture tells us that naturally exceptional individuals should not be either possible or desirable, because we are all equal and equally the products of our environment. In that respect this book suits our times as much as Carlyle's did his: instead of his unashamed and defiant hero-worship, it offers the guilty pleasure of wondering at the undemocratic wildness of eight great men. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Colin Burrow is a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and is the editor of Shakespeare's Complete Sonnets and Poems for the Oxford Shakespeare.</p>",
  "<p>About a year ago, I decided to join a class on the mystical poems of Jalal al-Din Rumi. Years before, studying Persian at Cambridge, I had read some of Rumi's 13th-century poems and remember warming to his harmonious view of the cosmos and his benevolent, highly personal Islamic faith. I told friends in Tehran, where I live, that I was looking for a teacher. </p> <p>A friend, Maryam, promised to introduce me to Mr B, her Rumi teacher for the past five years. A few days later, she reported that Mr B was reluctant to have a British journalist in his class. I was dismayed but not surprised. Many Iranians regard journalists as unreliable, and resent the British for their history of meddling, spying and otherwise obnoxious behaviour in Iran. It took several months before Maryam convinced Mr B to relent. </p> <p>In January, Mr B started a weekly class, to be held in the home of some people called Roshan, and I was invited to take part. It is quite common for educated Iranians to host classes in their houses. These classes are a small rebellion against the state's efforts to regulate the way people think and act: 25 years after the 1979 revolution, it is impossible to hold an intimate and relaxed poetry class in a public building. The authorities might balk at an assembly of men and women. The women would be unable to remove their hijabs, the Islamic head and body cover that must, according to Iranian law, be worn in public. Eavesdroppers might monitor the class for subversive political undertones. </p> <p>A few days before the first class, I visited a friend, Ali Dehbashi, in the offices of Bukhara, the literary magazine he edits. He is the editor of a collection of essays about Rumi, one of several recent Iranian books on the subject. Since the 1990s, he told me, Iran has been experiencing a Rumi revival. The poems, he said, are popular among \"people who want to keep their God\" but are \"not excessively religious\". Dehbashi is not surprised by the depth and duration of the revival. \"Historically,\" he told me, \"mysticism has arisen in response to doctrinal pressure.\" </p> <p>After taking power, Iran's cleric-politicians shut down lodges where mystical Islam was promoted, and silenced mystic holy men, called sheikhs, who disapproved of linking religion with worldly power. The clerics encouraged people to follow the recommendations of the most senior ayatollahs, rather than their own faith and conscience. </p> <p>One evening, I drove from my home in Elahiyeh, in north Tehran, to a township full of high-rise blocks. A middle-aged woman opened the door of a flat on the 14th floor, and introduced herself as Mrs Roshan. She ushered me into a sitting room lined with straight-backed chairs, and introduced me to her husband. She gave me tea and kak, a kind of millefeuille, and we looked out at the lights of neighbouring buildings. </p> <p>The other participants started arriving. The men hung up their coats and greeted the others, placing their right hands over their hearts and making barely perceptible bows. The women shed their headscarves and came in rearranging or patting down their hair. There was a married couple whose solicitous mutual regard betrayed them as newlyweds. There was a young woman with a plaster on her nose; and there was a young man, pale and brainy looking, who helped himself to a surprising quantity of kak. I learned later that we would have to pay around \u00a33 per class, which is beyond the means of most Iranians. We all held copies of the Masnavi-ye ma'navi. The title means the spiritual rhyming couplets. They were composed in the 13th century by Jalal al-Din Muhammad b. Muhammad al-Balkhi. </p> <p>Western readers know him as Rumi, from his long residence in Rum, so called because it had been the heart of the eastern Roman (or Byzantine) empire. (Rum corresponds roughly to Anatolia, the landmass that dominates modern Turkey.) He was born in 1207 in what is now Tajikistan, but his family moved west to Konya, the capital of the Seljuk Sultanate in Rum, when he was a boy. After receiving theological training in Syria, Rumi returned to Konya, where he achieved modest fame as an Islamic legal expert and preacher. </p> <p>In 1244, an ageing mystic, Shams of Tabriz, arrived in Konya and struck up a rapport with Rumi. The two men spent several months in seclusion and Shams guided Rumi towards an ecstatic realisation of God. Shams taught Rumi to whirl, accompanied by music or an invocation. In 1247, Shams disappeared. Grief-stricken, Rumi composed odes that ascribe divine qualities to him. In the late 1250s or early 1260s Rumi started his great narrative and didactic work, the Masnavi-ye ma'navi. He is thought to have spent at least a decade intermittently composing its 25,000 lines before his death in 1273. </p> <p>The Masnavi contains thousands of stories and anecdotes, many of them drawn from the Qur'an, interspersed with Rumi's advice. Rumi's poetry can transport the reader to a kind of rapture. However, he warned against the blinding effects of outer beauty, and urged his readers to seek the wisdom inside his wit. \"The letters are the vessel,\" he says in the Masnavi ; \"therein the meaning is [contained] like water.\" I know people who say that they have grasped this meaning and been changed by it. </p> <p>Mr B is a man of medium height, with thick grey hair and a beard. When I first saw him, he was wearing pressed corduroy trousers and a long woollen waistcoat over a white shirt. When he smiled, his eyes shone darkly. He began the class with the words, \"In the name of God, the compassionate and merciful\". </p> <p>Although the Masnavi addresses Muslims, it is tolerant of other faiths. In Mr B's telling, it treads a pragmatic path between the competing ideas of predestination and free will. Rumi rejects the extreme asceticism of other mystical traditions. \"If you hoard a coin in your pocket,\" Mr B told us, \"it is material. As soon as you give it, out of charity, it becomes spiritual.\" </p> <p>In an ode, Rumi describes love between human beings as a bridge to heavenly love. As someone who is married and recently became a father, I was reassured by this. Although he was observant of Islamic law, Mr B told us, Rumi believed that an observant person who is ignorant of Islam's spirit is \"more dangerous than an irreligious person\". In the Masnavi , Rumi hints that he can only communicate some parts of his awesome message; most people are incapable of understanding the whole. Mr B seemed to share Rumi's spiritual elitism. He referred disparagingly to \"the common people\", for whom \"only religious ordinances are important\". </p> <p>The classes developed a pattern. I would sit on a seat with my back to the window. The brainy-looking young man, a newly qualified civil engineer called Ali, sat on my left. The seat opposite was occupied by a middle-aged woman called Mrs Malayeri. She usually wore jeans and a T-shirt. </p> <p>For the first hour-and-a-half, Mr B would speak and we would take notes. (I am slow and clumsy at writing Persian, and would copy from Ali the bits that I had missed). Then there would be a break for tea and fruit. During the break, I would sometimes talk to Ali or to Mrs Malayeri, who is a yoga teacher. During the second, shorter part of the class, Mr B would read from the text, quoting in Arabic from the Qur'an, and from other Iranian poets. </p> <p>Once, while Mr B quoted and his eyes shone, I remembered that Mrs Malayeri had told me that poetry flows in the veins of Iranians, even those who are not bookish. I looked up. The girl with the plaster over her nose had closed her eyes. Mrs Malayeri was smiling. I smiled too. It was what Rumi had warned against, the blinding effect of beauty. The class ended joyfully. We thanked Mr B. </p> <p>The woman with the plaster asked if anyone intended to drive in the direction of Elahiyeh. I offered her a ride. She introduced herself as Simin and added that she hoped my wife would not mind my taking her home. As we walked to my car, Simin switched from Persian to English. She told me she was planning a PhD the sis, and that she had attended primary school in Leeds. She taught English at a language institute. </p> <p>For the next several weeks, I took Simin home after class and we would talk. She was hungry for information about literary life in Britain and the US. She complained that the London Review of Books was hard to find in Iran. Her favourite poets were the Metaphysicals; she loved Donne. </p> <p>Simin has no recollection of life before the revolution. In schools, on TV, in speeches made by politicians, the authorities have tried to mould young Iranians' view of themselves and their history. But she attends a weekly class on a great epic poem, Firdawsi's Shahnameh , whose roots lie in the mythology and legends of pre-Islamic Iran. For Simin, reading the Shahnameh is a way of reminding herself of Iran's \"glorious heritage\". </p> <p>Talking to Simin, I realised that poems like the Masnavi provide refuge not only from the Islamic Republic's interpretation of Islam, but also from aspects of western culture. Simin referred to a western-style consumer mentality that Iran's middle classes have embraced. The Masnavi , she said, teaches that \"if you want spiritual calm, you won't achieve it by building up material possessions\". </p> <p>One night, as Simin and I approached Elahiyeh, we passed a young woman in the street with a plaster on her nose. According to a plastic surgeon that I met a several months ago, Tehran boasts more nose jobs than most western cities. I took the opportunity of asking Simin about her own nose. Given the mystical verses that we were reading - verses that value the content of a thing, not its form - I wondered whether Simin regretted her vanity. \"In the 1990s, for the first time in so many years, we were exposed to western products and magazines, and people learned to be aware of their appearance,\" she said. Simin exempted herself from this category; her nose, she told me, had been operated on for medical reasons. </p> <p>Over the coming weeks, we read a story in the Masnavi about a king who falls in love with a handmaiden. When he brings her back to court, she falls ill. The king prostrates himself in a mosque and, entering a trance-like state, is warned of the impending arrival of a wise physi cian. The following day, an old man presents himself at court. </p> <p>Mr B explained that the king represents the seeker of spiritual perfection. The old man is his \"guide\". Their meeting mirrors the epiphany of Rumi's encounter with Shams. \"That was the greatest divine gift,\" Mr B said. \"Shams's physical aspect was human, but in reality he was something else.\" Mr B meant that Shams had been infused with God's spirit. </p> <p>According to Mr B, the journey to spiritual perfection must be accomplished from within. \"It's only by knowing yourself that you can come to know God.\" Mr B alluded to Rumi's view, expressed in the Masnavi, that a person who blindly imitates another person is like an ape. I thought of an Iranian academic, Hashem Aghajari. In a speech he made in 2002, he compared the unquestioning emulation by Shias of senior ayatollahs to the mimicry of monkeys. Aghajari was sentenced to death for this and other comments that were deemed insulting to the clergy and Islam. (The judiciary recently bowed to international pressure and commuted his sentence to a prison term.) Mr B quoted Saadi, another great Iranian poet, \"How can I thank God enough for the divine gift of being too weak to oppress?\" Everyone broke into smiles. It was a moment of subversion, a delightful moment. </p> <p>One evening after class, I approached Mr B and asked if he had ever known someone like the old man in the story. He replied that when he was a boy, growing up in the eastern province of Khorasan, he had read the poetry of a mystic shepherd called Baba Taher. Years later, as a student in Tehran, Mr B had felt an irresistible pull towards a man who passed him in the street. The man was a sheikh, and Mr B told him that he wanted to be his student. The sheikh said, \"I've known you since you started reading the poems of Baba Taher.\" </p> <p>I had heard that the Islamic republic had relaxed its hostility to mystic lodges. I tried to picture Mr B in such a lodge, spiritually inebriated, but the image was irreconcilable with the mellow, cerebral man I knew. Mr B told me, \"For every 100 people I teach, perhaps three are able to cross over into another kind of consciousness.\" </p> <p>Over the next few weeks, we inched through the story of the king and the handmaiden. The old man determines that the maiden is lovesick for an ironmonger in a distant city. On his instructions, the king uses promises of wealth and advancement to entice the ironmonger to come to court. United with her lover, the maiden recovers, only for the old man to feed the ironmonger a potion that debilitates him. The ironmonger becomes ugly and the handmaiden stops loving him. In the end, the ironmonger dies. </p> <p>According to Mr B, the story relates a struggle inside us - the handmaiden is worldly love that has become \"unhealthy\" because of its reliance on physical infatuation. She is cured when her lover loses his looks. The ironmonger represents our covetous and materialistic self. His death is \"a triumph over the devil in all of us\". </p> <p>During the break, I took my tea over to Mrs Malayeri. I asked her how she had become interested in Rumi. It goes back, she told me, to a personal calamity that happened shortly after the revolution (she did not tell me what), when she sought solace in Indian mysticism, Zen Buddhism and yoga. After six or seven years of study, and two visits to India, Malayeri regretted that she was ignoring sources of wisdom in her own culture. \"I asked myself, 'Malayeri! Where are you?'\" </p> <p>I asked if she had voted in February's parliamentary elections. She raised and lowered her eyebrows very quickly - a wordless Iranian \"no\". </p> <p>In 1997 and 2001, Iranians turned out in massive numbers to elect Mohammad Khatami as their president. But Khatami's plan to spread democracy was thwarted by a conservative elite made up of a few dozen clerics and their supporters in the judiciary, armed forces and media. They jailed his supporters, banned reformist newspapers and vetoed legislation. </p> <p>In the spring, Khatami inaugurated the annual Tehran book fair. Khatami is a bookish cleric. (He is not an ayatollah, which means \"sign of God\" in Arabic, but has a lower rank, hojjat-al-Islam, which means \"proof of Islam\".) He is a former culture minister and once headed the national library. After coming to power, he lifted many artistic restrictions and put a stop to the extra-judicial execution of intellectuals. </p> <p>Shortly after the inauguration, I had a rendezvous at the book fair with Ali, from Mr B's class. Of all my classmates, Ali intrigued me the most. Behind his shy exterior, I sensed a young man's wilfulness. Ali had told me that he had always been expected to follow a family tradition and become a civil engineer. But at university in the northern town of Rasht, he developed a passion for literature and philosophy. The other engineering students made fun of his bookishness. After graduating, Ali returned to Tehran and started a part-time degree in Iranian literature. He longed to give up engineering and devote himself to books. </p> <p>Ali was standing at an entrance to Tehran's open-air convention centre. At a refreshment stall next to a pavilion that specialised in religious books, some women in chadors, unbuttoned lengths of black cloth, held books of Islamic ordinances and sucked iced lollipops. Seminarians in gowns and turbans compared purchases. Ali and I dawdled in the English language pavilion, where a young clientele perused dictionaries, novels and DIY guides . </p> <p>Unlike his conservative opponents, Khatami does not fear pluralism in dress, beliefs or books. During his presidency, the book fair has grown and diversified. It has become a showcase for books that, before 1997, would not have cleared the censors. Next summer, Khatami's second term of office will come to an end, and the clerical elite will ensure that only conservatives may stand to replace him. The 2006 book fair may have a different feel. </p> <p>Ali and I bought chips and ate them sitting on a lawn. Ali was preoccupied by his professional dilemma. If he abandoned engineering, his family would be disappointed. It would mean material uncertainty. On the other hand, he longed to turn his back on a society that judges people \"not on what you think, but what you have\". I asked if the Masnavi was having an effect. He said: \"I've come to the conclusion that Rumi has something other than poetic power... he sees something that others do not.\" </p> <p>At our next class, Ali told me that he had consulted Mr B about his dilemma. Mr B had advised him to give up engineering only when he was certain that he could live with the consequences. Ali seemed relieved that Mr B had not pressured him to make an immediate decision. \"Things may be clearer,\" he said, \"when we've finished the Masnavi .\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Christopher de Bellaigue's book In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs: A Memoir of Iran is published by HarperCollins, price \u00a320.</p>",
  "<p>The Curious Life of Robert Hooke, by Lisa Jardine (Harper Perennial, \u00a38.99)<br> </p> <p>Robert Hooke left behind no defining great work, but claimed to have anticipated Newton's ideas and those of other leading scientists. Jardine argues he was probably right. Take the elliptical motion of the planets: Hooke hypothesised such a motion in conversation, but Newton produced the mathematical proof. Time and again this pattern repeated itself, but as the first curator of experiments at the Royal Society, Hooke was always rushed off his feet with the society's affairs so never completed anything. Newton's view of him as \"a man of strange unsociable temper\" has stuck, and Newton edited him out of the official story of the law of gravitation and destroyed Hooke's portrait at the society, leaving no image for posterity. In this companion piece to her biography of Hooke's lifelong friend Sir Christopher Wren, Jardine asks us to remember him with the admiration he deserves. <strong>IP</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> The Encyclopedia of Stupidity, by Matthijs van Boxsel (Reaktion, \u00a38.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>No one is intelligent enough to comprehend the depths of their own stupidity, states Matthijs van Boxsel in this engagingly eccentric history. Stupidity is inherent in us all and the more we seem to progress, the more mistakes we make. He argues that man differs from animals not by virtue of his superior wisdom, but by his stupidity, his ability to risk his own survival and that of his species on self-deluded whims. The technological advances that we hold up as proof of our progress are not always as clever as they appear: sun lotions contain carcinogens; cars built with sturdier chassis make it more difficult to extract casualties when they crash. And yet, he insists, without the mistakes and failures catalogued here, progress would be impossible. Fairy tales, science fiction, even garden history are haphazardly drawn together in this slightly surreal, often exasperating but consistently enjoyable view of the history of civilisation. <strong>NB</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Bill Clinton: An American Journey, by Nigel Hamilton (Arrow, \u00a39.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>Hamilton's previous biography famously outed Field Marshal Montgomery, so it's not wholly surprising to find that this specialist in sexual secrets has produced a life of Clinton that's a bemused but largely admiring account of how an erotomaniac somehow came to be US president - overcoming on the way other serious problems including a disastrous first term running Arkansas, near-divorce from chilly Hillary and exposure of his fibs in evading Vietnam service. The book concentrates on psychology, convincingly depicting the man from Hope as shaped by his fatherless upbringing by a working mother. It's excellent on the nitty-gritty of southern politics, with Betsey Wright (his chief of staff when governor) proving an invaluable source. Purchasers should be aware that it's something of a swiz: nothing on the jacket indicates that it stops in 1992 and does not cover its shagaholic subject's presidency. <strong>JD</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Arnhem 1944, by William F Buckingham (Tempus, \u00a39.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>Most accounts of Operation Market Garden paint Field Marshal Montgomery as the villain, vainly pushing ahead with the plan while Brigadier Frederick \"Boy\" Browning, the \"father of British airborne forces\", objects that it might be \"going a bridge too far\". Buckingham pours scorn on this version of events and lays the blame squarely at Browning's feet. In fact, were this an Alistair Maclean novel, he says, \"Browning would have to have been the German spy in the allied command\", so successfully did he sabotage the operation. Operation Market Garden was the self-serving Browning's last chance to consolidate his position in the military, and it had to go ahead at all costs. The result was that thousands of men died or were captured. British high command tried to blame the Poles, but Buckingham leaves the reader in no doubt that British army politics, inexperience and incompetence led to this tragedy of errors. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Global Ideas Book, edited by Nick Temple (Institute for Social Inventions, \u00a315)</strong><br> </p> <p>The people behind the Global Ideas Bank believe that technology can and must be used to change the way the world works. This handbook is a collection of ideas drawn from its website tackling housing, crime, politics and education. They range from the sensible (taxes on countries that make no effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; laws to ensure pharmaceutical companies publish negative as well as positive results) to the outlandish (mirrors that make us look thinner; laws to protect the rights of robots). At times the book does seem to prove the notion that innovations only create more problems. Mobile phone tracking devices may put parents' minds at ease but could be used for less noble motives. Labour-saving devices such as \"virtual fences\", whereby cattle can be monitored remotely, would surely increase unemployment in rural areas. And would a tax on divorce really \"make couples looking for an easy way out reconsider\"? <strong> NB</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Muddied Oafs: The Soul of Rugby, by Richard Beard (Yellow Jersey, \u00a37.99)</strong> <br> </p> <p>Rugby (a nine-to-five job for unsmiling, super-fit gladiators) has increasingly grown away from cheery, beery, character-forming rugger since the sport's top tier went professional, and now - with men ever less willing or able to surrender time to play and train without reward - threatens to crush it. That's the argument advanced by Beard, a novelist and utility back approaching the end of his playing days, who tests the amateur game's health by revisiting all his former sides and turning out for them where possible. He writes well, being equally good at evoking exhilaration and misery, and a quest that takes in Paris, Geneva and Tokyo as well as Cambridge, Argyll and Somerset offers intriguing contrasts. But the autobiographical approach generates too much material that lacks wider resonance: intercutting between his rugger memoirs and a more journalistic exploration of pro rugby might have produced a more compelling study.

  "<p>Eve Ensler has been saying the word \"vagina\" wherever possible for the past eight years and does not appear to tire of it. The writer of The Vagina Monologues takes great pride in being known as \"the vagina lady\" and her peculiar fame has circled the globe. Ensler has become a worldwide celebrity icon for women who find hearing the word vagina spoken in public to be a profound and transformative experience. </p> <p>Their response has always completely bewildered me. I read The Vagina Monologues and thought it sounded like post-feminist confectionery - fleetingly bonding, perhaps, but scarcely more consciousness-raising than a trip to see the Chippendales. Germaine Greer took part in a British performance of the play and found it a \"much-hyped and fundamentally unchallenging piece of buffoonish American hoop-la\". The scramble of actors to land the part where they got to say \"cunt\" on stage seemed to smack more of a celebrity bandwagon than a feminist movement, and some critics suggested Ensler was little more than a theatrical one-trick pony, exploiting the word vagina as a publicity stunt. </p> <p>But Ensler has now written a new play, The Good Body. It is another series of monologues by women, but this time about their whole bodies. The play opens with an admission that the playwright loathes her stomach, and proceeds through a series of monologues featuring a woman with anorexia in Kenya, an Indian woman addicted to the gym, an African-American teenage girl at fat camp, a model almost entirely rebuilt by her plastic surgeon boyfriend. Its message is simple: \"Love your body and stop fixing it. It was never broken.\" </p> <p>With a sleek ebony bob, russet red lipstick and mildly unconventional outfits, Eve Ensler looks like a hippy Anna Wintour. She is physically charismatic, and has a way at 50 of seeming both maternal and girlish - a fast-talking New Yorker, yet yoga-calm. Most striking is her intense emotional engagement. She is what therapists describe as \"present\". </p> <p>Ensler has done a good deal of therapy. Her middle-class childhood was scarred by a violent father who raped and abused her from the age of five to 10. She doesn't like to say much more about her childhood, except that her emotional survival strategy was to \"fight back\". By her early 20s she was \"as wild as it gets\" - an alcoholic drug addict living naked in communes, having \"massive amounts of sex\". At 24 she met her first husband and with his support sobered up. </p> <p>But from her mid-20s to late-30s she suffered from profound depression as she struggled with the legacy of abuse. Her marriage eventually ended, although the couple remain close friends, and 15 years ago she met an artist and psychotherapist with whom she has been since. She attributes her salvation to love and long years of therapy, as well as many years of writing. By the early 1990s she had become a modestly recognised, though \"way, way downtown\", New York playwright, staging productions for audiences of no more than a few hundred. </p> <p>Then, in 1994, she wrote The Vagina Monologues. It was an unexpected and instant hit. Women queued up afterwards to tell her stories about their vagina, often stories of rape, abuse and violence - and the play transferred to off-Broadway. Ensler used some of the proceeds to found V-Day, a worldwide movement to end violence against women, and persuaded famous actors to star in gala performances in Los Angeles and New York. By 2001, V-Day had become a global phenomenon. Through V-Day there have now been 2,300 productions of the monologues in 1,100 cities, including Islamabad and Kosovo, and they have raised more than $25m. </p> <p>Ensler's brand of feminism has evolved since The Vagina Monologues. She says her new philosophy is a longing for women to stop trying to transcend their body, in an assertion of intellectual equality, but to name and return to it as the source of female wisdom and power. Women have fallen for a post-feminist delusion that the greater their physical self-control, the greater their prospects of happiness, not realising that alienation from their own bodies actually destroys the possibility of empowerment. </p> <p>\"What a way to control us. This skinny thing is genius,\" Ensler exclaims. \"It's genius. If you're hungry you don't have a lot of energy, and it's really hard to think. You can't do anything except think about food! What women are doing to their bodies is so utterly frightening - and, more importantly, so distracting. And if we don't get off it, it's going to be devastating.\" </p> <p>The single greatest source of futile preoccupation and self-reproach in women's lives today - even the most apparently liberated women's lives - is the very thing that makes them female. It is taken for granted that a woman will despise at least part, if not all, of her body, and increasingly considered advisable for her to go to any lengths necessary to correct it. Self-acceptance would be tantamount to self-neglect. </p> <p>This false prospectus, according to Ensler, has been responsible for the decline of feminism's international power. Women alienated from their own bodies no longer identify themselves by their universal femaleness, but isolate themselves instead into unisex categories - profession, class, nationality - in which a broader sense of sisterhood is meaningless. The feminist context of their problems has become lost. </p> <p>\"When I was researching The Good Body,\" Ensler explains, \"I went to a vaginal laser surgery centre in Beverly Hills where women were tightening their vaginas and trimming their labia. I flew from there to Kenya, where women were having female genital mutilation. And I thought, this is bizarre. What's different about it? Somebody got it into their heads that if they got a tight pussy they'd be more lovable. Somebody got it into their heads that if they got their clitoris cut off they'd get a husband. What's the difference? It's some system that got imposed to shut women down and cut them off. That's what people have to understand. Every culture has a mechanism for ritual operations that they utilise to impose their particular beauty tyranny and control women.\" </p> <p>The Good Body is in many ways a globalised dramatisation of The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf. Wolf identified a direct correlation between the increase of women's power and the shrinking of fashion's edict of the \"ideal figure\". Models got thinner, clothes got smaller, and women who as 1950s housewives had been allowed to be content with naturally rounded figures now discovered that to be successful professionals they had not only to be good at their jobs, but to spend a large portion of their life in the gym and of their salary on cosmetic improvements. Despite having opportunities now to change the world, when asked what single change they would like to achieve, repeated surveys of women always produce the same answer: weigh less. </p> <p>But Wolf wrote The Beauty Myth in 1991. Susie Orbach published Fat Is A Feminist Issue in 1978, Andrea Dworkin was railing against diets long before that, and long-established feminists such as Greer have therefore questioned whether Ensler is offering anything new. \"There are serious and important points to be made about women's attitudes to their own bodies,\" Greer wrote, \"but feminists were making these points 30 years before Ensler clambered on the bandwagon.\" </p> <p>Nothing annoys Ensler more than the suggestion that her work comes too late to have relevance. It provokes a rapid-fire outburst of evidence to the contrary; when the monologues first became a hit, for example, CNN famously ran a 20-minute profile of Ensler without using the word vagina. It was truly a remarkable editorial decision - but surely only an example of the peculiarly prudish nature of the US. </p> <p>\"Hel-lo! What about Paris? When they first staged the play, they said they couldn't put it on unless they changed the name. And Rome! They only put it on in Rome two years ago. There has been nowhere - not one country - where this word did not cause problems. So when people say they've been there and done it, I laugh. I go, really? Really? You've done it, have you? So that, for example, young girls are being brought up to know their vaginas and touch their vaginas and look at their vaginas? Nowhere is this happening in the world. Do you think there's sex education happening anywhere, where girls grow up to know what their bodies are, to look at their bodies? It's not happening. Not happening.\" </p> <p>She is right; it clearly is not. If anything, attitudes are moving in the opposite direction. When Wolf wrote The Beauty Myth, plastic surgery was still relatively rare; 13 years later it is not only routine but sold to women as a trophy of empowerment: you're an independent girl now, you can afford to buy this gift to yourself. How can Ensler explain women's willingness to buy into this idea? </p> <p>\"The whole problem with feminism was that it was always too 'heady'.\" The reply is instant and emphatic. \"So women were changing their ideas, but they weren't changing their being. It was all in the head. And so, for example, you could be a very strong woman and have a great independent job - but you could be with a husband who still battered you. We didn't change our bodies or our beings, so all this stuff kept happening. Now there's a chance for this next movement to change all of us, not just our heads.\" </p> <p>How does Ensler intend to achieve this? An insight was offered by a conference she organised in New York this autumn, attended by 1,500 women. The event was co-hosted by an organisation called Omega - a vaguely new age foundation (\"Dedicated to awakening the best in the human spirit\") which usually holds spiritual retreats and yoga weekends. This made for an interesting aesthetic mix. Young V-Day activists wore T-shirts that read \"Value your vagina. Vote!\", Omega devotees wore floaty kaftans from India, and in the exhibits hall there was a touch of Camden Market meets the student union. </p> <p>Ensler's collaboration with new age therapies struck me as surprising, for she describes herself as a radical feminist. A therapeutic emphasis on \"inner spirit\" is a very long way from the radical feminism Ensler grew up with in the 1960s and 70s, and many activists of that era would consider talk of \"doing work on ourselves\" fundamentally antithetical to their political project. It is men, they would argue, who need working on. </p> <p>\"I used to be a militant maniac,\" Ensler admits, smiling slowly. \"I used to divide the world into good and evil, right and wrong, because it was much easier. I don't see the world like that any more. It doesn't bring about change. I've been involved in social activism my entire life and I would argue that many people involved in social activist movements have done very little work on themselves. And that has created power structures and power dynamics that are just like the ones we're trying to get away from. Look at the inability to unify on the left - the endless fragmentation. I've just seen so many dynamics repeated over and over that don't work. And I think it has to do with people ...\" she pauses delicately, \"not having any self-awareness.\" </p> <p>Anyone who has been involved in leftwing activism could not fail to recognise what she is talking about. But feminism based on new age spiritualism can come dangerously close to pseudo-mysticism, hints of which were on show at the conference. From a stage adorned with candles and flowers there was talk of internal \"rivers\", of \"waters flowing\", and of other opaque symbolism. One young researcher stood up and solemnly announced: \"My focus is the empowerment of women. And what I know is that women know what they know.\" Can Ensler truthfully say she knew what that statement meant? </p> <p>\"I'll tell you exactly what that means.\" Her answer is quick and forceful. \"When you say to a woman you know what you know, there's not a woman on this planet that doesn't have an inner voice. One that she's learned to disregard because of patriarchal censorship. Like when people say to a girl, why did you get in the car with him? And she says, 'A voice inside me was telling me not to.' Only she'd learned to disregard it. That's what knowing what you know means.\" </p> <p>Another reason why some feminists have been dubious about Ensler is her willingness to promote her work through celebrity. Among the conference speakers were a number of Hollywood stars. Didn't their presence distract from more important matters? There was a time, she agrees, when she would have said the same. \"But there came a day - it was during the anti-nuke days - and there I was on a street corner, handing out flowers, as I did on a regular basis. And some guy spat on me and called me a dirty commie. And I thought to myself, this isn't working. This just isn't worth it. You are not changing anything. This is just for me. I'm just doing this for me to feel good; I'm not changing the world. </p> <p>\"And at the time I was so opposed to celebrity culture, and so opposed to the hierarchy of some people matter and some people don't. But there came a point where I said, OK, you can go on like this and you can stand on the street corner - and you can be right. But not have an impact. Or you can figure out another way of doing this so that people will actually show up to hear what you're saying. </p> <p>\"Do I think it's great that we have a celebrity system where some people matter and some people don't? No. But do I think we'll always create icons and legends? Yeah, I probably do.\" </p> <p>Ensler's most eloquent celebrity supporter has turned out to be Jane Fonda. For women under 35, Fonda is synonymous with her workout video, which in turn is synonymous with the 1980s. The Jane Fonda workout was sold to women on a promise that it would help make them thin but, more importantly, that it would make them strong. It was self-punishment masquerading as self-empowerment. </p> <p>Fonda now travels the world on behalf of V-Day, and was interviewed by Ensler on stage in New York. She addressed the audience in a voice breaking with emotion. \"My father always married women with thin legs,\" Fonda said. \"He used to send messages through his wives: tell her to wear longer skirts. By adolescence I hated my body. And you can't be in your body if you hate it, so I moved out and into my head. I'd moved out of my body to disown it because I wasn't perfect enough for patriarchy - and I didn't move back until I was 61. </p> <p>\"I was bulimic and anorexic for 35 years. I lived on willpower; I have tremendous willpower. I'd just will myself into exercise, and all the while I was living in my head, being perfect.\" Fonda said she had always loved trees. She was teaching herself to think of her legs as Arizona sycamores. \"I've betrayed my legs. They've never betrayed me.\" </p> <p>Fonda said her moment of epiphany about her body had come while she was watching a performance of The Vagina Monologues. \"For 20 years I thought I was a feminist - and then, while I was watching, my feminism just slipped from my head into my body - I felt it - and I've never been the same again. As I've begun to heal, I could feel a need to fill my body with what I was seeking all along - which was actually my feminine soul.\" </p> <p>Life-changing epiphanies were once the stock-in-trade of feminism. Women read The Feminine Mystique and suddenly saw the light - they recognised themselves in Betty Friedan's unfulfilled housewife, obsessed with the trivial tyranny of housework while the world passed them by, and they wanted a change. But the women's movement stopped producing new epiphanies, and it gradually unravelled from emotional certainty into self-doubt and dispute. Young women today could be forgiven for thinking that feminism was little more than the name given to an interminable media debate about how to get your work/life balance right. </p> <p>Having grown up in this era, the last thing I expected from Ensler was a moment of epiphany. It certainly wasn't forthcoming from The Vagina Monologues. But as she and Fonda were talking about bodies, quite suddenly the penny dropped. I felt something happen inside - intellectual anger about beauty tyranny changed into physical rejection of it, a less sophisticated but more formidable force - and I understood the difference between them. </p> <p>Feminists have for generations been urging resistance to the tyranny of beauty. But their language has been grounded in \"issues\", with the effect that Botox or anorexia became interchangeable with equal pay and flexible working hours. Ensler is proposing something quite different - not a version of feminism that includes, among other things, an argument against hating our bodies, but a feminism that derives entirely from trusting our bodies. \"When things change in your body,\" Ensler says, \"you say no to things. You have to.\" </p> <p>It is hard not to feel angry that feminism still has so far to go - and this may explain why some feminists have found Ensler so irritating. The popularity of The Vagina Monologues can be read as a depressing revelation of how little earlier feminist works had achieved. But it is hardly Ensler's fault if women still get a thrill out of hearing the word vagina; her plays are transforming armchair post-feminists into activists, and radicalising women more effectively than a whole generation of feminist theory. </p> <p>And The Beauty Myth is not the only book that appears to have passed many women by. There were some at the conference who could have stepped straight from the pages of The Feminine Mystique. One woman was 60 and said she felt rather uneasy with the \"politics\" she'd heard here. She had raised her sons \"in a traditional way\", and they were fine men. But then she added, uncertainly, \"I'm coming up to retirement age. I'm going to see a fortune teller and I want to ask, will there be more for me to do? I've been in the same house for 30 years. I've just redecorated it. But I don't know. Maybe it's time to move on - I think, maybe I should get out there. But I don't know where to go.\" She paused. \"I'm a bit afraid, to be honest. But I think I'm capable of more.\" </p> <p>Ensler is the first feminist in a generation to have won this 60-year-old woman's interest. The capacity to inspire epiphany in others is a life-changing gift. It is remarkable to inspire it in a woman who had never given feminism a thought - but possibly even more so in a younger woman who imagined she'd heard all that feminism had to say. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Good Body by Eve Ensler is published by William Heinemann on October 21 at \u00a310.99.</p>"
