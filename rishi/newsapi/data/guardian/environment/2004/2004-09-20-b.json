  "<p> It will be a long time gone, 20 months at least, but the memory of the last big event at the old Ascot racecourse should endure for a good deal longer than that. No less than 22 horses were declared yesterday for the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over a mile on Saturday, and almost a third of those are winners at the highest level already. </p> <p>With four of those being Classic winners either this season or last, and other performers of Group One level including Norse Dancer, Diamond Green and Antonius Pius among the possible runners, it was no surprise that Coral felt obliged yesterday to ease Soviet Song, the ante-post favourite for the race. </p> <p>From 2-1, James Fanshawe's filly is now 3-1 and the overall strength of the field is such that Attraction, the brilliant winner of the 1,000 Guineas in May, can be backed at 10-1 with Coral. Newmarket's other Guineas winner, Haafhd, is only a point shorter at 9-1 with Ladbrokes, while Refuse To Bend, who won the same Classic last season, is 7-1 with Coral. </p> <p>There is even a dark horse to add spice to the mix in the shape of Aidan O'Brien's Ace, a three-year-old son of Danehill who made a successful racecourse debut in June and has won both his races since. O'Brien is still looking for his first Group One win in Britain this season, but he nominated the QEII as Ace's next assignment as soon as he won a Group Three at Leopardstown last month, and such is the respect for any runner from Ballydoyle that he is as short as 10-1 with Hill's. </p> <p>Even by the considerable standards of the QEII, this renewal appears exceptional. The winner will surely be acknowledged as the best miler in Europe, and quite possibly the finest at any distance. The bookmakers cannot be faulted, though, in making Soviet Song their favourite for the race. </p> <p>\"Soviet Song has come out of her win in the Matron Stakes [in Ireland, beating Attraction] in very good order,\" James Fanshawe, the filly's trainer, said yesterday. \"The aim has always been to go for this race, and the only reason she wouldn't go to Ascot would be if I wasn't happy with her closer to the date. </p> <p>\"It looks a tough field, but she has done everything right in her last three races, and ran very well when she was second in the Queen Anne [over the straight mile at Ascot]. </p> <p>\"The only thing you have to hope for with so many runners, especially going around the bend at Ascot, is that you'll have some luck in running.\" </p> <p>The seven-strong contingent of Group One winners in Saturday's entries is completed by Rakti, who won the Prince of Wales's Stakes in June, Bachelor Duke, who took the Irish 2,000 Guineas in May, and Le Vei Dei Colori who, like last year's winner Falbrav, is a winner at the top level in Italy. </p> <p>The stop after Ascot in the autumn cycle of championship races is Longchamp the following weekend, when North Light, the Derby winner, seems increasingly likely to start favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. </p> <p>Sir Michael Stoute's colt has not seen a racecourse since his second to Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby in June, but he will make the short trip to the Rowley Mile in Newmarket this afternoon to gallop between the second and third races on the card. He is expected to work over nine furlongs, and an acceptable display will fuel the gamble that has seen him backed down to 4-1 favourite for the Arc with Ladbrokes.</p>",
  "Many of us daydream of retiring overseas but the July issue of Money Observer magazine recommends the dream is accompanied by thorough research. Moira O'Neill, Deputy Editor of Money Observer, says: \"Your budget needs to buy a property, swallow the impact of foreign taxes and cope with potentially greater living costs since the cost of living is not necessarily cheaper abroad.\" <p>Apart from climate and the cost of living, the availability of good health services, links with a supportive expatriate community and a secure environment are important considerations. Recent research suggests that Spain, Australia, France, Canada and the US are the top five dream retirement locations, but for those on a tighter budget, Money Observer recommends some affordable alternatives. </p> <p>Cyprus combines driving on the left-hand side of the road with a great year round climate. Best of all residents pay income tax at a maximum of 5 per cent with nothing to pay in the UK. South Africa can offer luxurious living at a third of the price of property in Spain but choose a location with care. </p> <p>Thailand - Phuket offers a hot and humid climate throughout the year with good medical facilities and a low cost of living. </p> <p>Jamaica has a high incidence of violent crime. But the intrepid can pick up plantation houses with a sea view for a few hundred thousand pounds.</p> <p>Germany - bargain rural properties can be found in the former East Germany with pretty half-timbered houses and cobbled streets. But the country faces Europe's worse pension funding crisis.</p> <p>More details on the personal, financial and legal issues to take into account before retiring abroad can be found in Foreign Hotspots For a Happy Retirement on pages 14-21 of the August issue of Money Observer, priced \u00a33.99, available at newsstands from Friday 23 July 2004.</p> <p>To interview Moira O'Neill, Deputy Editor of Money Observer, please contact Julie Taylor on 020 7713 4087. </p>",
  "<p>Be afraid. Be very afraid. Three years after September 11, the International Monetary Fund believes the threat to the global financial system has passed. The Fund sees nothing but well-capitalised banks becoming more profitable on the back of a strengthening global economy. </p> <p>\"Short of a major and devastating geopolitical incident or a terrorist attack undermining, in a significant and lasting way, consumer confidence ... it is hard to see where systemic threats could come from in the short term.\" </p> <p>The bullishness of that assessment virtually guarantees that something is about to go wrong soon, not because the Fund lacks expertise nor because its judgement is demonstrably untrue, but because that's the way life is. Those IMF staff members who are parachuted into crisis-stricken countries when the trouble starts would be advised to keep an overnight bag at the office, just in case. </p> <p>The reason for the Fund's cheeriness is obvious. When the dotcom bubble burst, there were fears that the boom built on speculation would be followed by a colossal bust. These concerns were amplified by the shock to the global political system by September 11, which affected consumer and business confidence. Yet the west has only suffered the mildest of downturns, far less severe than those at the start of the two previous decades. The United States bounced back, Japan piggy-backed on China's boom, Britain has not had a single quarter of negative growth. Even Europe, the global tortoise, has been doing a bit better. </p> <p>The explanation for this is twofold. At the policy level, central banks and finance ministries took action to boost demand - cutting interest rates and loosening fiscal policy. At the micro level, banks were more rigorous in their approach to risk management, which has made them financially healthier. </p> <p>Looked at from this perspective, the recent signs of sogginess in the US are merely a blip. During the long upswing of the 1990s, there were what Alan Greenspan calls \"soft spots\" and this is one of those. After the lull, we can expect strong growth to resume, with the next cyclical downturn in the global economy delayed until the next decade. </p> <p>This is a perfectly acceptable analysis, and many economists find it plausible. There are at least three reasons why the immediate outlook is not quite so rosy. </p> <p>The first is the recent lack of volatility in stock, bond and currency markets may have encouraged hedge funds into taking reckless decisions. While some of the increase in the price of oil this year has been due to demand from China and worries over security of supply from the Middle East, a fair slug of the cost of crude is a speculative premium. The trials and tribulations of Long Term Capital Management at the time of the Russian debt default in 1998 shows how a highly leveraged hedge fund can be affected by sudden price movements. Even now, there may be funds nursing big losses following the increase in the cost of crude last week caused by the shutdown of US production caused by Hurricane Ivan. </p> <p>The second cause for concern comes back to the Fund's belief that everything should be all right absent a geopolitical or terrorist shock, which presupposes the geopolitical situation as it stands is relatively benign and the possibility of another September 11 is much diminished. In the light of what is happening in Iraq and the Middle East, not to mention Russia, that seems contestable. What's happening to crude markets is not brainless speculation but has something to do with the fact that the global economy is increasingly dependent for its oil supplies on a Russia reverting to authoritarianism and an unstable Middle East. </p> <p>The final reason to be cautious is the risk that the twin locomotives for the global economy - the US and China - come off the rails at the same time. This is not factored into any of the upbeat forecasts, which take it as read that the US is long past the worst of the dotcom aftermath and that Beijing will be successful in engineering a soft landing for China from unsustainably rapid growth. </p> <p>Brian Reading, of Lombard Street Research, challenges this. He says the global economy is held together by a Bretton Woods-style fixed exchange rate regime that is doomed to collapse. Half the world, he says, is yoked together in a new dollar area, which has the US and Asia marching in step. The synchronised boom will end not in a soft landing but in synchronised diving in 2005-06 that could spawn a legacy of deflation and protectionism. The modern \"dollar area\" is made up of an inner core of countries - China, Hong Kong and Malaysia - pegged to the dollar and an outer ring of Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Russia, managed against it. Including the US, these countries make up half the world's dollar GDP. </p> <p>The original Bretton Woods collapsed in the 1970s, once the strain of holding it together proved too great. Bretton Woods was an attempt to revive the gold standard, albeit in a modified form. One difference was that under the gold standard a country running a deficit was forced to deflate while one operating a surplus had to reflate. This was painful but eventually restored equilibrium. </p> <p>In the 1960s, America - paying for Vietnam and the Great Society welfare programmes - was running a big current account deficit, but had no intention of dealing with it by deflating domestic demand. The Europeans and the Japanese were opposed to the idea that they should run inflationary booms, so the circle was squared by the Americans flooding the global financial system with dollars. Given that under Bretton Woods system these dollars could be exchanged for gold, it was inevitable that at some point, creditor countries would start demanding gold for their dollars. </p> <p>Reading's point is that Bretton Woods 2 is less stable than Bretton Woods 1. It is a marriage of convenience, rather than a formal arrangement; it was created by the countries on the periphery so the US has no obligation to resist a devaluation of the dollar, it is not a gold exchange system, and it has developed when US imbalances - a 5% current account deficit and a 5% budget deficit - are extreme. \"It is more like late Bretton Woods than early, but worse\", he notes. </p> <p>There are only three ways to reduce the US current account deficit. One option would be for the dollar to depreciate, making US exports cheaper and imports from Asia and Europe dearer. This is certain to be resisted by the rest of the dollar area. A second option would be for Asia to continue booming, which Reading says is implausible. Action to deal with inflation will expose overinvestment and this will lead to a hard landing. This leaves the third option, slumping domestic demand in the US. That would amplify the downturn in China, the rest of Asia and Europe by reducing flows of imports into the US. </p> <p>Reading's conclusion is sober but at least as plausible as the notion that the global economy is unscathed from its recent travails and is on the threshold of sustained, untroubled growth. </p> <p>\"The new dollar area, like Bretton Woods, must end in tears. The synchronised boom it has created cannot continue. There can be no soft landing for the US or China. Quite simply, Americans save too little and must save more, meaning demand and incomes must shrink. The Chinese invest too much and must invest less, meaning demand and incomes will contract. This is the recipe for synchronised sinking.\" </p> <p>&lt; A HREF=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\"&gt;larry.elliott@theguardian.com <!-- A --></p>",
  "Roger Taylor carefully tousled his hair before getting astride his trusty bicycle and pedalling furiously to the House of Commons. The papers had held off, thanks to the American president's visit, but his career was certain to end tomorrow, he thought sadly. It wasn't fair. He was basically a decent cove, who was able to riff pointlessly on almost anything for page after page. <p>Eric Onyeama couldn't believe he was making his first appearance in chapter three and that so much space had been given to Roger's aper\u00e7us on middle England. He decided to treat the reader to his own fascinating insights into multicultural London life as he gave the stolen ambulance a parking ticket. </p> <p>The four terrorists were becoming tense in the ambulance after so much time wasted on Roger and Eric's monologues. Now was not the time to hear how Jones learnt his bomb-making skills at the taxpayer's expense at the so-called University of Llangollen, how Haroun was looking forward to his 72 virgins and how Dean was the new Jackal. \"But we'll hear it anyway,\" muttered Jones, as he told everyone to arm their suicide bombs. </p> <p>Cameron, Roger's American intern, was regretting forging the security passes. But she did trust Adam, the only man in Britain who had dared to stand up to her. </p> <p>Adam was feeling guilty that he had lied to Cameron about why he needed the passes. Still, she would understand that a wounded Abu Ghraib prisoner should embarrass the president in front of the world. The French ambassador's girlfriend didn't feel at all guilty about deceiving Adam. </p> <p>The security forces ordered their marksman to take out the four terrorists. Jason Pickel took aim but his sidekick nudged his arm as she had begun to worry about his mental stability after his tour of Iraq. So he missed!!! What larks. </p> <p>Jones ran into the chamber and chained himself to the president. \"We're going to have a global telephone poll to see if America should return the Guantanamo detainees,\" he announced. The director of the BBC decided to set up a premium rate phone line. </p> <p>At first, the voting went against America. Jones dialled the wrong number and blew up Haroun by mistake. How Haroun split his sides! Roger and the French ambassador made impassioned speeches about the free world and everyone rang to say they loved America after all. </p> <p>The prime minister was wondering how he could save his job as Pickel fired a tranquiliser dart. And hit the president!! Jones reached for his gun and Roger wrestled him to the ground. Democracy was saved and, as Roger went home, he reflected that the papers would never dare expose him for investing in a lingerie shop that turned out to be a brothel. What japes. He laughed, not noticing that no one else was joining in. </p> <p><b> The digested read ... digested</b><br> </p> <p> On your bike.</p>",

  "<p>Later today I shall outline the Liberal Democrats' approach to the economy at our party conference in Bournemouth. </p> <p>I shall emphasise the need for financial discipline. Within that framework I shall emphasise our commitment to fairer rather than higher taxes; to tough spending choices rather than higher levels of spending. </p> <p>I do not believe it is always helpful to indulge in the usual knockabout Punch and Judy opposition routine. The government has a generally good record in maintaining economic stability, steady growth and - if we ignore the hidden, economically inactive, population - falling unemployment. </p> <p>My main criticism in this area is a certain complacency about the growing personal debt secured against the extraordinary \"bubble\" in house prices. Relying on the Bank of England alone to achieve a so-called soft landing seems to me dangerously complacent. Time will tell. </p> <p>I also acknowledge that the government has committed substantial resources to public services financed by extra taxation. We called for this increase and voted for it. The issue now is how to spend it effectively in the highest priority areas. </p> <p>There is a temptation, for which the Conservatives have fallen, to pretend that large sums can easily be released by \"abolishing waste\". Of course, genuine waste must be cut and the current Gershon review will hopefully identify it. But it is intellectually lazy to use \"waste\" to opt out of the need to make choices. </p> <p>By contrast, we have identified \u00a35bn of Labour's spending per year and \u00a325bn over the period of a parliament, to be reallocated to pay for equivalent spending commitments. </p> <p>These cuts include the Child Trust Fund, which we believe would be more productively used for further investments in education; and the set-up costs of the government's proposed identity card, which would be better spent on additional policing. </p> <p>There is scope for reducing defence procurement costs by, for example, scaling back the order for Eurofighters, or for cutting the costs of IT procurement by making use of open source software. </p> <p>We could cut bloated, over-centralised departments such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. </p> <p>We also envisage substantial savings from cutting Department of Trade and Industry activities, as we close the department, amounting to just over a quarter of the planned budget over a five-year period. </p> <p>Some DTI activities are useful, like funding scientific research in fields such as new renewable energy and cancer research. </p> <p>We support them and would continue them elsewhere in government, cutting instead more questionable industrial assistance from a department whose priorities have included a bail-out of the privatised nuclear power industry and government underwriting of arms exports. </p> <p>Our largest spending commitment is to promote a citizen's pension to people over 75 - including women who are currently ineligible; earnings- linked and free from elaborate means testing. There is a growing consensus, everywhere except Downing Street, that this is the way forward. And we have shown how it can be paid for. </p> <p>It is remarkable that, under a government that speaks the language of social justice, income and wealth inequality are as bad as in the Thatcher years, and that the poorest 20% of the population pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the top 20%. </p> <p>A major culprit is the regressive council tax inherited from the Conservatives. It should be replaced by a local income tax, based on the ability to pay, as used successfully in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the United States. We also believe the very rich should pay more: a 50% rate of tax on earnings over \u00a3100,000 per annum. </p> <p>With the revenue we would finance the abolition of student fees and top-up fees, the scrapping of charges for long-term care affecting elderly people with conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and the transition to fair local taxes. </p> <p>This agenda is not \"left\" or \"right\". It combines economic liberalism and a deep concern for social injustice. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Vincent Cable is Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor</p>",
  "<p>The row over performance related pay between Nottingham University and its lecturers reached a new deadlock today as the Association of University Teachers fulfilled its promise to stage an academic boycott of the university.</p> <p>The union is concerned about new contracts introduced by the university which it says will mean staff only get a pay rise if they achieve an \"excellent\" rating. Its determination to fight such a clause has led to a stand-off with the university, which refuses to discuss the issue while under threat of boycott. </p> <p>Speaking on his way to a meeting with Nottingham lecturers, the AUT assistant general secretary, Matt Waddup, said the union had hoped it would not have to go ahead with today's action, which means that any academic supporting the boycott will refuse to cooperate in any way with Nottingham.</p> <p>He said: \"We'd be much happier if we didn't have to do this, but the University of Nottingham have failed to take the views of their staff seriously enough.</p> <p>\"We believe that the university is placing its international reputation in serious danger,\" he added.</p> <p>The action could mean some students do not receive their proper exam marks should other universities refuse to moderate papers from Nottingham students. It could also mean academics at other universities won't review papers submitted by Nottingham University academics.</p> <p>However the AUT said it had received messages of support from universities in the US, Canada, Scandinavia and France. Last week the Trades Union Congress also declared its support for the boycott. In response, Nottingham took out an advert in two national broadsheet to set out its side of the story.</p> <p>Mr Waddup called the advert \"a distraction from the main issue\".</p> <p>Stressing that the AUT was \"not a radical union\" and was in favour of negotiation, he added: \"We understand that the university wants to monitor its staff, but the evaluation of their performances should not be linked to pay. </p> <p>\"We can't accept the university trying to ride roughshod over our member's interests. We want a negotiated solution. We want to sit in the same room as the university management and talk. But so far they are refusing to speak to us.\"</p> <p>Head of public relations at the university, Phillip Dalling, dismissed AUT claims its management style was aggressive.</p> <p>\"Calling for a global academic boycott of Nottingham University is quite a serious thing,\" he said. \"We took out the ad because we felt we had some important points to make and we felt it was important to advertise in newspapers that will be seen in the academic community.\"</p> <p>The university confirmed it would refuse to engage in talks until the AUT called off the boycott.</p> <p>\"We would be happy to negotiate with the AUT, but the university council doesn't believe that negotiations are possible under threat,\" Mr Dalling added.</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, today proposed \"substantial manpower change\" in the public sector to pay for the party's spending plans, refusing to rule out exceeding Gordon Brown's job cut plans. <p>Speaking to the media ahead of his conference address, Mr Cable said a future Lib Dem government would make savings of \u00a35bn in government spending but refused to explain how many jobs would be lost in the process, saying that he had not \"done a headcount exercise\".</p> <p>He conceded, however, that it was \"inevitable\" that some people might lose their jobs in some government departments.</p> <p>\"I don't pretend to you that the Liberal Democrats are into giving public service jobs for life and there would be painful consequences for some of these contractors,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have not done a head count. But there would be change and there would be very substantial manpower change.\"</p> <p>Job cuts are most likely to be felt in the Department of Trade and Industry and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which Mr Cable plans to scrap altogether, and the culture and environment departments, where he plans significant cuts.</p> <p>In his conference address, Mr Cable warned delegates of the tough decisions ahead, and urged them to engage with the \"painful economic realities\".</p> <p>\"Budgets have to add up. Choices are needed in public spending. People want fairer taxes, not ever-rising taxes, and they want value for money.\" </p> <p>Mr Cable restated the \"traditional liberal message\" of Adam Smith: \"That markets must be allowed to work; trade should be free; [and] private enterprise should not be shackled by excessive regulation.\"</p> <p>And he ruled out tax rises other than the party's existing plan to raise the top rate of income tax to 50% for those earning over \u00a3100,000 a year.</p> <p>That tax rise is to be used to fund the Lib Dems' key \"social justice\" pledges; abolishing student tuition fees, introducing free personal care for the elderly, and minimising the cost of its new \"fairer\" local income tax.</p> <p>While the cuts in the DTI and other departments, plus the scrapping of the government's plans to introduce ID cards and \"baby bonds\", will pay for an increase in the state pension for the over-75s, the recruitment of 10,000 new police officers, and the introduction of free eye and dental checks.</p> <p>As the party's plans are based on the government's existing spending commitments - which include projected savings from the cull of 84,150 public sector jobs in England and 20,000 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - it appears that Mr Cable would wield an even sharper knife than the current chancellor.</p> <p>Mr Cable is certainly aware that his proposals have to be watertight, with Labour and the Conservatives ready to pounce on any discrepancies or un-costed pre-election promises.</p> <p>In a sign of what is to come, the Tory leader, Michael Howard, yesterday accused the Lib Dems of making 100 new spending pledges funded by 40 new proposed taxes.</p> <p>Mr Cable insisted this morning, however, that his plans are \"pretty conservative\" in their estimates, while he warned colleagues this afternoon that they must retain \"economic discipline\".</p>",
  "<p>A Dutchman has sex with a Japanese courtesan in a print made by Chokosai Eisho at the end of the 18th century. He babbles in his funny foreign way, but she merely replies: \"I can't understand what you are saying at all. Push! Do it harder!\" There's an incense burner to cover his awful Dutch smell. </p> <p>This about sums up an exhibition that surveys complex global relationships over 300 years. Asians and Europeans may not have understood each other in the centuries after Vasco da Gama circumnavigated Africa to reach India in 1498, but their encounters were robust, and often pleasurable. As provocations go, this one is luxurious. The objects in it are doubly exotic - they represent Europe to Asia and Asia to Europe; wallpaper made in China comes from an English country house, a telescope made in 18th-century England has been lent by Beijing's Palace Museum. </p> <p>Whatever your views on trade relations in the early modern world, this is a sumptuously enjoyable show. It is a provocation, none the less. The thesis is that 19th-century imperialism has blinded us to the far richer relationships that existed between different parts of the planet before 1800. The first contacts between Europe and India, China and Japan were characterised by trade and exchange. The global market created cultural \"fluidity and hybridity\". This has already been attacked as an optimistically liberal argument in favour of globalisation. It also seems to be true. The exhibition offers more than enough evidence to prove its case. From the start, you see the world in a new way, as crowds of people carry away goods brought by a Portuguese ship on a 17th-century Japanese screen. </p> <p>Rarities proliferate. Here is the suit of Japanese armour that belonged to James I, here an 18th-century Chinese imperial concubine shows off her European clock. Goods flowed in both directions. The European Enlightenment feasted its fantasies on Chinoiseries. But Europe was not just a Dutch barbarian. Its discoveries were real, not least perspective painting which fascinated Japanese artists. An 18th-century print of a brothel is a perfect complement to the image of a stinky Dutch lover. Okumura Masanobu translates perspective into Japanese to create a pictorial game he called a \"floating picture\". Screen after screen recedes.

  "<p>Former BBC director general Greg Dyke today refused to rule out a return to ITV, saying he was open to job offers after completing his book on the row with the government that cost him his job. </p> <p>Mr Dyke said ITV had endured a \"pretty dreadful five years\" and that he would consider any offer. </p> <p>\"I'm Greg Dyke, unemployed of Twickenham, so don't rule out any jobs. I was writing a book so I decided not to make any decisions about my career until I'd finished it.\" </p> <p>\"No one has come to me and offered me a job at ITV. If they did I'd consider it as I'd consider any other job. I'm not sure I'd take it, that would depend on the circumstances at the time,\" added Mr Dyke in an interview with ITV's news channel to publicise the launch of his autobiography.</p> <p>Some ITV shareholders continue to speculate that the company should replace the current chief executive, Charles Allen, with his old enemy Mr Dyke, as the broadcaster battles falling ratings and an undervalued share price.</p> <p>Mr Allen, who originally clashed with Mr Dyke in the mid-1990s when Granada bought LWT, retained his job in the face of the shareholder pressure that ousted the Carlton chairman, Michael Green, when the two companies merged to form ITV plc earlier this year. </p> <p>But it is considered unlikely Mr Dyke would be welcomed back to ITV, with some board members of the view that his vitriolic attack on the government makes him unsuitable.</p> <p>\"Dyke will never be chief executive now. There are some on the board that think he simply wouldn't be able to finesse the political deal that needs to be done over public service broadcasting,\" said one senior ITV insider who is not a particular fan of Charles Allen either. </p> <p>The rumour mill went into overdrive earlier this year when it emerged that the new ITV chairman, Sir Peter Burt, had met with Mr Dyke in his capacity as adviser to private equity group Apax. </p> <p>Sir Peter was later forced to insist Mr Dyke had not been approached \"for any role whatsoever in ITV\" and put on record his support for Mr Allen. </p> <p>Since then investor sentiment has swung in Mr Allen's favour, with analysts suggesting he remains the preferred choice to implement the cost savings achieved by the merger. </p> <p>In the interview, Mr Dyke said the commercial broadcaster had not done enough in the past five years to deal with the threat of multichannel television. </p> <p>\"ITV has had a pretty dreadful five years. And at a period when the digital world hit and channels were exploding all ITV was doing was consolidating within. That isn't enough and it needed to do more,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I find it quite sad, as do others of us who left ITV in the mid-1990s. We find it quite sad what's happened to ITV but it doesn't mean to say it's not recoverable. It could be recoverable by the current management or it might need a new management, I don't know.\"</p> <p>Mr Dyke also repeated his concerns that the BBC's journalism was going through a \"traumatic\" period in the wake of the Hutton report. </p> <p>\"Whether it's journalism is robust enough? By and large, yes. But it is going through a traumatic period post-Hutton. It needs to be robust again,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Dyke also criticised the intelligence services and John Scarlett, recently promoted to the head of MI6 despite his role in the Iraq dossier row. </p> <p>\"The people who come out worst from the whole thing are the intelligence services. What do we want them for? Their evidence is all bullshit, as we all now know. What are they for? For John Scarlett to be given the job of head of MI6 - as I said in my book, the courtier was repaid.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>More than a third of the waste paper and plastic collected by British local authorities, supermarkets and businesses for recycling is being sent 8,000 miles to China without any knowledge of the environmental or social costs - and to the complete surprise of most consumers. </p> <p>New government figures suggest that exports to China are running at 200,000 tonnes of plastic rubbish and 500,000 tonnes of paper and cardboard a year - a huge increase on just three years ago.</p> <p>Much of the plastic sent to China is packaging but a Guardian investigation has found that agents for Chinese companies are now buying up and exporting thousands of tonnes of unwashed bottles, containers, and other household waste.</p> <p>\"China is buying up everything it can. It is sucking in material from all over the world and it doesn't give two noodles what it takes,\" said one plastics recycler who asked not to be identified. \"I know of 300 firms, mostly in China, offering to buy my plastics. I have three or four companies cold-calling me every day from China requesting material. They have very cheap labour to sort the material but the shame is that it is being done there and not here. They don't care about the quality, or the contamination. No one checks what is sent or what arrives.\"</p> <p>The British plastics industry admits that the global trade is starving some local recycling initiatives of materials and putting established firms out of business or at risk. According to UK plastic recyclers, agents for Chinese companies areoffering \u00a3120 a tonne for mixed plastic bottles, far more than British companies can pay. \"The industry here can only support \u00a350 a tonne. We believe that 10-15,000 tonnes of old bottles are going to China. Yet only about 25,000 tonnes were collected last year\", said Stephen Chase of Chase Plastics.</p> <p>\"The Chinese put me out of business,\" said Edward Clack, a plastics recycler who invested in two recycling plants in Britain. \"Everyone has lost supplies to China. The local market is being starved of materials. Hundreds of brokers are buying up the plastic and shipping it out. It's cheaper to send a container to China than to Scotland.\"</p> <p>China drives the global waste trade, importing more than 3m tonnes of waste plastic and 15m tonnes of paper and board a year. But the trade is being driven equally by tough EU legislation forcing local authorities and businesses to recycle more. Landfill charges are rising steeply, making it relatively cheaper to send the waste abroad. Meanwhile, major companies have moved in, offering to collect and dispose of large quantities.</p> <p>The trade is made possible by the vast numbers of shipping containers arriving in Britain with Chinese exports. One of Britain's largest freight forwarding companies confirmed that the return waste trade to China is accelerating rapidly.</p> <p>\"We are shipping a phenomenal amount of waste, maybe 15,000 tonnes a week to China,\" said a spokesman for Warrant freight forwarders of Liverpool. The current price for sending a standard 26-tonne container of waste plastic to China, he said, is about \u00a3500.</p> <p>The Tanjin Songzi Import and Export Trade company based in the huge port of Tianjin Xingang is typical of the growing trade. \"We are specilize [sic] in import the scrap plastic bottle, waste plastic, waste paper. Europe origin. Please show me your offer,\" says its advertisement on an international plastics exchange website brimming with traders wanting the raw material for the Chinese industrial revolution.</p> <p>Most Chinese plastic waste importers want pictures of what they are buying, but some are are not fussy. \"We buy all types, such as the mineral water bottles, pure water bottles and plastic bottles of other drink. Any specifications will be fine. If you can supply, please email,\" says Mr Lee of a Shanghai company on the same site.</p> <p>Western plastic companies are setting up in China, but some of the poorest people are employed to sort and recycle the plastic. \"Plastic is now one of the biggest industries in Guangdong province, but much of the work is being done by migrant labour earning a pittance,\" said Martin Baker, of Greenpeace China.</p> <p>\"I would say that Britain is dumping its rubbish in the name of recycling. It is not responsible recycling that is being done. It is reprocessing, but the methods being used are still mostly rudimentary. There are some good factories, but on the whole it is small scale, done in backstreets with little environmental standards. People are burning plastic, sorting it by hand, the water gets polluted and it goes back into the rivers,\" he said.</p> <p>UK supermarket chains, some of the largest generators of plastic packaging waste in Britain, are all getting their recycling done in China, said a spokesman for Sainsbury's. \"We send 5,000 tonnes of plastic there a year. We used to send it to a firm in Nottinghamshire, but it has closed down,\" he said. \"We looked for others in Britain but no one could match the Chinese option for quantity or price. We would love to see it being recycled here, but it's not possible at present.\"</p> <p>But Ian Bowles, a spokesman for Asda, said he did not know where the company's plastic recycling was being done. \"UK companies pick it up. As far as we know it's being reprocessed here. It could be that excess quantities are going abroad.\" Other retailers known to be generating large quantities of plastic waste, including Tesco, did not respond to questions about where their recycling was being done.</p> <p>No detailed studies have been done of the environmental costs of shipping vast quantities of waste from Britain to China, but environment groups and MPs were yesterday shocked at the scale of the trade. \"Exporting lightweight packaging waste to China makes little sense environmentally,\" said Liberal Democrat MP Sue Doughty. \"It is a failure of the UK recycling market which allows the UK to export plastic for recycling. We have no control over environmental standards in China. Instead of solving the problem we are exporting it. Much more needs to be done to stimulate the markets in the UK so that waste is handled as close as possible to the point of generation.\"</p> <p>Clare Wilton, wastes spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth, said: \"People will be shocked that some of the newspapers and empty drinks bottles they put out for recycling can end up in China. It's an environmental disgrace. The solution is to expand the UK's own recycling industry. This would be good for the environment, create local jobs and help Britain become a leader in green technology.\"</p> <p>Sending plastic bottles to China is \"barmy\", said Mike Croxford, manager of Newport Wastesavers, which collects 50 tonnes a month of plastic from 50,000 homes in south Wales. \"We should be dealing with the stuff here, but the reality now is that most plastic in Britain is going abroad. I don't think the public knows where some of it goes. If they knew it was going right round the world, they might not encourage it.\"</p> <p>But other recyclers said it was better to send rubbish to China to be recycled than to put it in landfill in Britain. Andrew Simmons of the Peterborough-based waste charity Recoup buys millions of plastic bottles from UK councils, bales them up, and sells them to a reprocessor who then sells them on to Europe or, increasingly, to China. He rejected claims that Britain was dumping its rubbish on China and said that the environmental cost of sending bottles thousands of miles was negligible compared with making \"virgin\" plastic bottles from oil.</p> <p>China is increasingly aware that countries are exporting their pollution to them and have imposed strict laws governing what can be exported. Large amounts of German household waste have been found and all waste exports from Japan have recently been halted after electronic and contaminated household waste was found. However, the Chinese authorities, plagued by corruption, are unable to check the contents of all the waste containers that arrive in Chinese ports every year.</p> <p>British plastic bottles are mostly sent to Hong Kong where they are sorted and \"flaked\" before being sent to factories on the mainland. \"One type of plastic bottle goes on to make soft furnishings and clothes, another is made into pellets which are sold back to European manufacturers to make things like plastic bags,\" said Mr Simmons.</p> <p>This insatiable demand for the world's rubbish, he said, has actually boosted the British market for plastic recyclers, raising the price and making it far more worthwhile for councils to collect and not dump it in landfill. Partly because of this, more than half of all British local authorities now offer plastic recycling.</p> <p>More and more British plastic is likely to go to China, said Tim Frier of Valpac, whose subsidiary, Valiant, collects waste from more than 5,000 businesses in Britain, including supermarkets, pubs and clubs, and sends up to 15,000 tonnes of plastic to China a year. Valpac has just opened an office in China.</p> <p>\"We will be sending more there. But they have strict rules. The problem was that a lot of waste going to China was contaminated, and not being sorted properly. There were concerns about British waste, too,\" he said.</p> <p>The government insists that companies have export licences but few if any checks are made in British ports. The Environment Agency admits that it is unable to check what is being exported.</p> <p>\"There is a legitimate trade in waste exports for recovery involving materials such as paper, ferrous metals, plastics and card. These wastes are classed as 'green list' and are not subject to the same level of control as wastes classed as hazardous,\" said a spokesman.</p>",
  "Last-ditch attempts to save the life of a British man being held hostage by Iraqi militants were under way last night as a deadline set by his kidnappers loomed. <p>The families of Kenneth Bigley and the two Americans being held with him begged the kidnappers not to carry out a threat to kill the men when the deadline was reached in the early hours this morning. The Foreign Office took the rare step of putting up an official to make an appeal for help on the Arabic satellite television station, al-Arabiya. </p> <p>In Iraq officials said authorities were pursuing a number of leads in connection with the kidnapping of the men, who were shown blindfolded and bound in a video released at the weekend. British and US special forces were also thought to be standing by. </p> <p>Despite George Bush declaring that combat operations were over more than 16 months ago, the growing hostage crisis and insurgency led Tony Blair yesterday to talk of a second war. </p> <p>In a joint press conference with his Iraqi counterpart, Ayad Allawi, who was on his first visit to Britain yesterday, he said coalition forces were engaged in a \"new conflict\" now that the \"first conflict\" to remove Saddam Hussein was over. But the battleground of this fight was global terrorism versus \"the side of democracy and liberty\". </p> <p>Fears for Mr Bigley were raised last night when two more videos were released by militants. One purported to show up to 18 members of the Iraqi national guard, who were being held by extremists. The captors claimed they would be killed unless a detained Shia leader was freed. </p> <p>The second showed the beheading of three Kurdish Democratic party members, possibly seized near Baghdad. </p> <p>Mr Bigley, an engineer from Liverpool, was kidnapped from the house he was sharing with colleagues Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong in Baghdad on Thursday. The men worked for the Qatar-based company Gulf Supplies and Commercial Services. </p> <p>In a video transmitted by the al-Jazeera TV on Saturday, they were shown blindfolded, with their hands bound. </p> <p>Al-Jazeera said the men were being held by the Tawhid and Jihad group. It reported the extremists had threatened to kill them within 48 hours unless women prisoners were released from Abu Ghraib and Umm Qasr prisons. </p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Allawi said they were doing everything they could to secure the release of the men. But the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said giving in would set a \"very bad precedent\". Speaking on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost, he said: \"Really our policy is not to negotiate with the terrorists.\" </p> <p>In a Foreign Office transcript of the appeal by Mr Bigley's family, his younger brother Philip said: \"I'm here today to speak on behalf of our mother, Lil, who's 86 and is too distressed and too confused to give this statement. My mum just wants to see her son home safe and sound.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Ken has enjoyed working in the Arab world for the last 10 years in civil engineering and has many Arabic friends and is understanding and appreciative of the Islamic culture ... He wanted to help the ordinary Iraqi people, and is just doing his job.\" </p> <p>FO official Dean McLoughlin, an Arabic speaker, also appeared on al-Arabiya, to appeal for information. He said it would be dealt with \"in the utmost secrecy\". </p> <p>In contrast to French officials, who launched a high-profile diplomatic offensive across the Middle East after two French reporters were kidnapped a month ago, British diplomats have worked quietly behind the scenes. </p> <p>An official in Iraq said: \"We are in the office from early in the morning until after midnight collecting information.\" </p> <p>In Saturday's video Mr Bigley sat slumped on the floor of a white room next to the two Americans. A gunman wearing a black hood pointed his Kalashnikov at one of the men before reading their demands. </p> <p>The Tawhid and Jihad is allegedly linked to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the radical Jordanian who the US accuses of plotting attacks in Iraq. </p> <p>The group's ultimatum that all female prisoners be freed is baffling. The last woman in Abu Ghraib, Huda Alazawi, who is interviewed in today's Guardian, was freed in July. The US is holding only two females at Baghdad airport - Rihab Taha and Huda Amarsh, both senior scientists who worked on Saddam's alleged biological weapons projects. </p> <p>More than 100 foreigners have been kidnapped in Iraq recently - some 30 executed. At the weekend militants allegedly holding the two Frenchmen said the men had been freed but had chosen to stay and report on the resistance. </p> <p>The Salafi Brigades of Abu Baqr al-Siddiq yesterday said it was holding 10 hostages working for a US-Turkish firm.</p>",
  "<p>An angry father perched on a Buckingham Palace ledge in a Batman suit may have seemed a bit of a laugh but the stunt raised some potentially uncomfortable legal issues. For a start, Batman (Jason Hatch) could easily have been shot. His sidekick, Dave Pyke (dressed as Robin), was following him up the ladder when an officer pointed a handgun at him and shouted \"Come down or I will shoot\". So down he came. </p> <p>Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens pointed out that the alarms and CCTV had operated and that if it had been thought that Batman was carrying a bomb \"he would have been shot\". Terrorists may now have noticed that silly clothes seem to gain the wearer free access to both Parliament and royal palaces. </p> <p>Thankfully, the media were not reporting shootings but providing the very oxygen of publicity that Fathers 4 Justice craved. The Daily Mirror boasted last week that its reporters were at the group's weekend summit (which apparently turned into a foul-mouthed drinking session). And they would have been aware that this was not merely boasting - Hatch is due in court later this year concerning a demonstration on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. The Daily Mail was also in the know and printed 12 photographs, showing the protesters from the moment they jumped the railings and propped a ladder against the side of the building, to Hatch's eventual descent, six hours later, in a cherry picker. Spirited undercover reporting or aiding and abetting criminal acts? </p> <p>The Mirror was not particularly taken with the campaigners of Fathers 4 Justice, but justified its substantial coverage as an expos\u00e9 of the vulnerability of royal security - following on from its scoop last year when one of its reporters posed as a royal footman for two months. The Sun has gone one step further than the Mirror, by putting a hack in a staff job at the House of Commons and allowing him to smuggle in a fake bomb. </p> <p>But when newspapers get too close to criminals, or criminal conduct, there can be unexpected repercussions. The media are not protected from the criminal law by any special reporting dispensation. When BBC reporter Mark Daly went undercover to film The Secret Policeman in Manchester, for example, he was arrested for obtaining a pecuniary advantage (his wages) by deception, and damaging police property. </p> <p>Criminal law does not just punish those who actually commit offences but also those who conspire to do so or \"aid and abet\" wrongdoers. And this is where media organisations are vulnerable when they find themselves too close to protesters. Newspaper publishers (and reporters) have enough money to pay fines and, unlike protesters, don't actually want their staff to go to jail. </p> <p> The Accessories and Abetters Act, passed in 1861, makes those who aid and abet indictable offences liable to be tried and punished as a principal offender. The Magistrates Court Act of 1980 covers lesser offences tryable by magistrates rather than a jury and the state tends to bring those claim ing a higher ethical purpose before magistrates rather than a jury. </p> <p>There are some legal safeguards - one has to wilfully encourage the crime and mere voluntary presence at the scene of the crime is not necessarily sufficient. However, worryingly for journalists, the reported cases show that if someone witnesses the commission of a crime and offers no opposition, though he might reasonably be expected to have tried to prevent it (or at least express his dissent), this might provide sufficient evidence for a conviction for aiding and abetting. Photographers and reporters beware. </p> <p>Another possible concern is that the criminal law in its wisdom allows the conviction of a secondary party, in certain circumstances, when the actual perpetrator of the substantive offence is either acquitted or convicted of a lesser offence. </p> <p>The secondary party may also be convicted where the law breaker has some defence that does not benefit the secondary party. The textbook cases include a husband aiding and abetting when forcing his wife to commit buggery with a dog - she had a defence of duress. But suppose protest groups start using children to commit their trespasses and burglaries? </p> <p>With MPs now targeted, as well as royalty and global corporations, there may be little sympathy from the state for journalists caught up in the wrongdoing of others, even if they only intended to get the best pictures rather than commit a crime. </p> <p>The Press Complaints Commission Code of Practice requires newspapers to maintain the highest professional standards, but other than requiring accuracy and that criminals should be not be paid for stories (unless in the public interest) it allows newspapers to be partisan and to decide for themselves what the main stories of the day are - whether or not that involves being manipulated by pressure groups. </p> <p>But broadcasters have tougher regulations still. The BBC producers' guidelines require that news should be presented with due accuracy and impartiality and that the BBC has the editorial input necessary when wit nessing or reporting ongoing illegal activity (such as the trespass at the palace). Criminals are not allowed to glamorise their wrongdoing. </p> <p>The Ofcom code too is wary of protest stunts. \"Programmes should neither glamorise nor condone criminals or their actions\". The code does say that crime is rarely without victims, but Batman at Buck House caused little distress to anyone. </p> <p>The amount of publicity in the newspapers and on television will only encourage this particular pressure group, and no doubt many others, to embark upon similar stunts. Greenpeace takes its own film crews along when involved in direct action and the ALA has videoed attacks on farms and laboratories. These tapes were made available to the media, and television regulators require considerable care when using such third-party material as the images can be a lot less fair, accurate and impartial than they look at first. </p> <p>The various media regulators' codes may need to be tightened to take account of this new non-violent attention-grabbing, although a template exists. Broadcasters do take care already to deny free publicity to those who disrupt football games or race meetings - streakers are a rarity on screen nowadays. </p> <p>The media have a self-imposed obligation to report what is actually going on and editors, not judges, are best able to evaluate what is of interest to their readers. Some high-profile stunts, such as last week's invasion of the House of Commons, are (presumably) intended to highlight causes where there is considerable public support. But a claim to be exposing lapses in security may not always be sufficient to justify a crime. The police knew what Hatch was up to and exercised common sense judgment rather than pulling a trigger, and one would not want the presence of the media to provoke a more extreme response against non-terrorist protesters. </p> <p>A further worry for the media is that the family of a shot protester could sue the media for damages if it could be shown that the journalist put him up to it, compensation culture being what it is. The police would have a defence, the media not. </p> <p>Reporting protest is beyond the law but encouraging even honourable criminal stunts is not. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Duncan Lamont is a media partner at City solicitors Charles Russell</p>",
  "No one ever said it was going to be easy to patch up transatlantic relations after months of bitter differences over Iraq. But it is proving far, far harder than many had imagined. <p>In a week that saw further deterioration - with devastating car bombs in Baghdad and Kirkuk, chillingly organised hostage-taking, swelling insurgency and mounting criticism of heavy-handed US military tactics - America and Europe seem as far apart as ever.</p> <p>Al-Qaida may have suffered some serious blows, but its Jihadist affiliates are continuing their deadly business across the globe. The terrorism George Bush vowed to eradicate after the 9/11 attacks seems more virulent and widespread. Indeed, it has taken root where it did not exist before: in Iraq itself.</p> <p>Jacques Chirac, the French president and leader of Europe's anti-war camp, made no bones about his views when he declared that the US-led invasion of Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein had opened up a \"Pandora's box which none of us can shut\".</p> <p>This might have been more in sorrow than in anger: there has been no more of last year's undiplomatic name-calling about \"freedom fries\" and \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\". But the message was unmistakeable: the (now officially confirmed) failure to find any weapons of mass destruction and the alarming ramifications of post-war chaos have vindicated most of the arguments Paris made against the war. And the kidnapping of two French journalists has also shown that opposition to the US is no guarantee of immunity.</p> <p>Mr Chirac was speaking in Madrid at a short summit with German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister and enthusiastic new recruit to the \"Old Europe\" so disparaged by Donald Rumsfeld in the run-up to the conflict.</p> <p>The three-way get together - in part about deal-making on EU issues - seemed deliberately designed to efface the image of Mr Zapatero's conservative predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, shaking hands with Mr Bush and Tony Blair at the Azores summit on the eve of war.</p> <p>Mr Zapatero came to power in March on the back of the Madrid train bombings and quickly fulfilled his pre-election pledge to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq. Washington is now deeply irritated at his suggestion that other countries in the \"coalition of the willing\" should follow his example.</p> <p>Mr Blair was conspicuously absent from the festive dinner at Madrid's Moncloa palace, suggesting that prospects are poor for his hopes of forging a trilateral alliance between London, Paris and Berlin to call the shots in the EU and repair the damage caused by the war.</p> <p>Things were supposed to develop differently this summer after the UN security council unanimously authorised the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and the transformation of the US-led occupation into a \"multinational force\".</p> <p>Europeans still grumbled, but the handover of power to an interim Iraqi government and the prospect of elections next January did at least offer a way forward. Chris Patten, the EU external relations commissioner and outspoken critic of the war, put it well: \"We all have a stake in rebuilding Iraq and closing the gates of hell,\" he said.</p> <p>Events on the ground - the mounting insecurity, violence and kidnappings of foreign aid workers - have meant that very little has been done. US cash intended for reconstruction has been diverted to security spending. And it quickly became clear that Nato - the institutional embodiment of transatlantic ties - was as deeply divided about the post-war situation as it had been before the invasion.</p> <p>Modest plans to deploy a Nato mission to train the fledgling Iraqi security forces have yet to be agreed. The same \"gang of three\" - France, Germany and Belgium - which opposed a preventive deployment to Turkey last year are opposing any arrangement which requires the alliance as a whole to be involved. Spain has joined them.</p> <p>No surprise then that in Washington John Kerry has been highlighting Mr Bush's difficulties in winning Nato backing. No surprise either that the vast majority of Europeans want to see Mr Kerry in the White House, though their governments cannot of course say so in public.</p> <p>But even a Kerry victory will not automatically end transatlantic disagreements: a survey commissioned jointly by an American and an Italian thinktank showed recently that a growing majority of Europeans seek a more independent role from the US. Some 58 per cent of Europeans said strong US leadership in the world was undesirable, an increase of nine percentage points from a similar poll last year. Only in Britain and the Netherlands do a majority desire strong American leadership. Eighty per cent of the Europeans surveyed did not believe the invasion of Iraq was worth the loss of life and cost. Some 73 per cent of Europeans believe the war increased the risk of terrorism, as do 49 per cent of Americans. </p> <p>Transatlantic disagreement over Iraq, of course, is accompanied by continuing EU-US splits over the Middle East, where Mr Bush is now seen to be acquiescing to the ruling Likud party's hardline approach to Israeli settlements, as well as the wider question of tackling the root causes of terrorism.</p> <p>But it is the disaster of Iraq that, for now, dominates everything - and makes the outcome so vital for a healthier relationship between the Old and New continents. Mr Blair and Ayad Allawi, the interim Iraqi prime minister, sounded determined enough when they met in London yesterday. But Blair's comment that Iraq was now the \"crucible\" in which global terrorism would either succeed or founder will not have persuaded Jacques Chirac - and very many others - that he was wrong about Pandora's Box.</p> <p>\"Is the world today safer than before the overthrow of the appalling Saddam?\" Patten asked in the European parliament last week. \"Is global terrorism in retreat? Are we closer to building bridges between Islam and the west? Is the world's only super-power more widely respected? Have the citizens in our democracies been treated in a way that will encourage them to give governments the benefit of the doubt next time they are told that force needs to be used pre-emptively to deal with an imminent threat? I simply pose the questions. The answers are well known.\"</p>",

  "<p>Jim Gray has a problem. The editor of Channel 4 News has just won an International Emmy award that is unlikely to pass through airport security. The trophy is a winged female figure, and \"I'm worried about the wings,\" says Gray from his New York hotel. \"They are quite sharp. They could take someone's eye out.\" </p> <p>Rewarded for its coverage of the Madrid bombings, it is the second year running that Channel 4 News has won the prize - the first time this has happened in Emmy history. As ITN, producers of the bulletin since its inception 22 years ago, gears up to negotiate the renewal of the Channel 4 contract, the award could not be better timed. </p> <p>\"When I bring the Emmy back she will be flaunted in front of the eyeballs of those who count,\" says Gray. \"I see everything that we do as a downpayment on our pitch to renew the contract. I think about it every day and bring it up whenever I can. I want to make it impossible for them to even dream about taking it somewhere else.\" </p> <p>The signs are good. The channel has just extended ITN's contract to make its midday news programme until the end of 2006, when the deal to produce its evening bulletin also runs out. </p> <p>The contract is one ITN can ill afford to be without, having lost Five News to Sky. The satellite broadcaster, which has pitched for the Channel 4 business before, is almost certain to do so again. </p> <p>\"Commercially it will not be particularly damaging to the bottom line, but spiritually it was felt,\" says Gray of the loss of Five News. \"It was a bit of a dent to morale and we were very sorry to see it go. ITN is a winning company. We win things, but [in that case] we didn't.\" </p> <p>Gray, a former deputy editor of Newsnight, has been in charge since 1998. A year into the job, he relaunched it with a garish new set, but one which looks almost tame today compared with the extravagant virtual reality surroundings of his ITN colleagues at ITV News. </p> <p>\"The agenda hasn't changed, with its emphasis on foreign affairs, analysis and reportage, but it's the way we do it. The programme has a lot more energy, and we are more open and diverse about what we pursue. We used to have no-go areas, such as royalty, sport or crime, but if it's a good story then why not?\" </p> <p>The BBC's head of TV news Roger Mosey recently suggested that Gray's bulletin had succumbed to a tabloid agenda by leading with stories about David Beckham, Michael Jackson, and John Kerry's private life. </p> <p>\"I emailed Roger to say glad you are watching, happy to oblige,\" says Gray. \"But it's all in the mix. It's about connecting with issues that people are talking about and they are not always global macroeconomic ones, although we do that as well. We want to subvert expectations. Under our remit we are encouraged and expected to push things a bit harder, otherwise why bother?\" </p> <p>When Alastair Campbell famously burst into the studio 15 months ago, Gray says he was \"levitating off his seat with excitement\". It doesn't get any more unpredictable than that. </p> <p>\"He didn't turn up and demand to be on. We had been bidding for him all day,\" explains Gray. \"We tried to get Richard Sambrook on the phone to ask him a question but they [the BBC] were a bit too cute for that. Our phones lit up with people saying they never normally get to see these people.\" </p> <p>Mention of Campbell inevitably leads to Hutton. \"We all went away and thought very hard about what we do,\" says Gray of its aftermath. \"I can be quite aggressively nitpicky. But things do happen on air that aren't planned and when they do you have to be bold enough to make it right as soon as you can.\" Does he think the BBC has been cowed by the affair? \"I know some of the people involved and I doubt it. All I'm going to say is I certainly hope not.\" </p> <p>Channel 4 News won last year's Emmy for its coverage of the war in Iraq. It was dedicated to Channel 4 News correspondent Gaby Rado and the other journalists who died covering the conflict, although it is not thought his death was the result of military action. </p> <p>\"The judgment and thinking that goes around certain foreign deployments is a lot more intense than it used to be,\" says Gray. \"Journalists are now seen as prey. Broadcasters collaborate a lot more on safety, sharing tips on what towns and roads are safe. It's not just helpful, it's bloody essential.\" </p> <p>Gray deferred sending the international editor Lindsey Hilsum into Iraq earlier this year because it was judged too risky. \"It was a particularly dangerous phase of kidnapping and killings. Lindsey is one of our most experienced correspondents but we held off for several weeks. The danger is not so much in Baghdad as going in and coming out. The road from the airport into town is particularly nasty.\" </p> <p>Channel 4's coverage of the Madrid bombing was anchored by Jon Snow in a one-hour special outside the Atocha railway station on the day of the blasts. </p> <p>\"It was a most demanding story to cover,\" recalls Gray. \"There were two shocks - the shock of the day itself, followed by the aftershock of people's disquiet and then anger about what the government was saying. There were tough questions to be asked but you had to remember a lot of people were dead, and if you got it wrong the viewer could feel you were trampling in places you shouldn't be.\" </p> <p>Snow, says Gray, is \"at the top of the game. Quite a bit of the programme is Jon's energy and curiosity and occasional barminess. There is good barminess and bad barminess. The bad is what he puts into the morning meetings and doesn't emerge.\" </p> <p>With the introduction of its midday and weekend bulletins, Channel 4 News is a linchpin of the Channel 4 schedule, on-air eight hours a week (compared with five six years ago). With one eye on ITN's bottom line, Gray wants more. \"My ambition is to get work with news and current affairs but also outside of that,\" he says, pointing to programmes ITN made about the annual Muslim pilgrimage, the Hajj, and a 90-minute special for Channel 4's religion department about the Shia festival in Karbala. </p> <p>The Channel 4 contract is worth around \u00a320m a year to ITN, compared with the \u00a335m it receives from ITV. Gray still misses News at Ten. \"ITN is proud to make news for ITV, but there was something about the big clock face, Trevor McDonald and the bongs that all combined into a very powerful package.\" </p> <p>Like News at Ten, Channel 4 News is one of its station's best known brands. Its importance is unlikely to be lost on Channel 4's chief executive, the former BBC marketing head Andy Duncan. </p> <p>\"He's sharp, very likeable and likes what we're doing,\" says Gray of his new Channel 4 boss. \"[Director of programmes] Kevin Lygo is never slow to let me or the top talent know we are doing a good job.\" Gray is due to meet Duncan again soon. Expect contract renewal to be at the top of the agenda.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing lasts forever. Especially not Real Madrid manager Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho. Just three games into the season, the man with the famously sweaty pits, the soothing presence of a rhino in a playground, and an obsession with 'huevos', or balls, has quit in a huff. Again. </p> <p>He lasted 115 days. Which really isn't very good, although it is slightly better than his last stint as coach at the Bernab\u00e9u, when he managed to walk out after 23 and without taking charge for a single match. The first time, Camacho walked because the then president Lorenzo Sanz wouldn't let him chose his own back-room staff; this time it's not just the president but the players too who are the problem. </p> <p>After long conversations with Ra\u00fal, Helguera, M\u00edchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos (but not, noticeably, the ever-petulant Guti, one of the club's captains), Camacho resigned yesterday, insisting that he couldn't take it any more, that he could not control the dressing-room, that he had lost the support of the club heavyweights. </p> <p>P\u00e9rez refused to accept and a final decision will be made today, but it's hard to see Camacho, as stubborn as a mule with his feet nailed to the floor, backing down now. All the more so as everyone knows about it - as straight down the line as Daniella Westbrook, Camacho's not the kind of bloke to lose face. Nor, though, is P\u00e9rez. </p> <p>Now, the Spanish press like nothing more than a good old crisis, as gratuitously inflated as a bright orange balloon emblazoned with David Mellor's grinning mug, but this time it's true: Madrid are in crisis. A proper crisis. A real crisis. A galactic one. </p> <p>They were rubbish but lucky 1-0 winners in their opening two league games against relegation candidates Numancia and Mallorca and weren't just beaten but utterly humiliated by Bayer Leverkusen in Europe - a performance so bad that Diego Maradona called them \"a bunch of dogs\". And then on Saturday night came the final straw. Madrid lost 1-0 against Espanyol at Montjuic with a display of slapstick genius that also managed to sum up so much of what's wrong. </p> <p>It had everything. Two red cards, for Walter Samuel and M\u00edchel Salgado; first-choice goalkeeper Iker Casillas getting injured in the warm-up; reserve keeper C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez saving Ra\u00fal Tamudo's penalty - twice - before getting injured himself; a penalty miss from Ronaldo; Roberto Carlos bombing about aimlessly up front; Guti telling the fourth official he's a \"son of a bitch and a clown\"; and no sign whatsoever of a reaction, or any football, from Madrid. </p> <p>Oh, and four gal\u00e1cticos missing. Which rather says it all. With Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane already injured, Camacho responded to the Champions League disaster in classic, subtle style - by dropping David Beckham and, at last, captain Ra\u00fal. </p> <p>It was a powerful, aggressive statement of intent from a man disgusted with the attitude of his players, the gal\u00e1ctico culture and the way the club is run. But it was also, at long last a capitulation in the face of pressure from within and without to drop the untouchable yet frankly awful Ra\u00fal. It was, said AS on Saturday morning, a revolution. But it didn't work. </p> <p>\"When you thump a fist on the desk you either break the desk or you break your hand, nothing else happens,\" said Roberto Carlos, really saying it all about Camacho's attitude and the players' reading of him. A bruiser and a bully, Camacho is not the right man for the job, unable to control the hardest thing to control at Madrid - the dressing-room. </p> <p>Which is a bit of a downer, what with that being precisely why P\u00e9rez brought Camacho in - his third coach in as many seasons, a record that even Jes\u00fas Gil would be proud of. First P\u00e9rez got rid of Vicente Del Bosque because he was cuddly, had a brilliant moustache and was the son of a railway trade unionist (\"not modern enough\", ran the official reason). Then, he opted for, and made a scapegoat of, Carlos Queiroz when Madrid achieved nothing (except a great new club record of five successive defeats, of course). </p> <p>Never mind that the squad was too short, that Queiroz pleaded for a centre-back and a defensive midfielder, or that he wasn't allowed to play Celades, who left, or Cambiasso, who didn't but might as well have done. No, it was all Queiroz's fault. He was too soft, too permissive of the capricious gal\u00e1cticos. </p> <p>Not to worry, fans' favourite Camacho would sort them out (even if P\u00e9rez did buy him Owen when he wanted Vieira). A tough-tackling Madrid legend with a foul mouth and a pair of 'huevos' the size of the Bernab\u00e9u, famous for marking Johan Cruyff out of his first derbi, was brought in to provide some discipline, to make the gal\u00e1cticos sweat almost as profusely as he does. Squat, ugly, far from refined, he was the very antithesis of gal\u00e1ctico - and that was what Madrid needed. </p> <p>Only it wasn't. Camacho has walked into a special environment, already rarified by galactically myopic P\u00e9rez's marketing-obsessed handling of the club, which causes division and resentment and has left some big-name stars and smaller-name-but-no-less-important players longing to leave. Camacho resents his president's impositions and has found himself unable to handle the dressing-room. Rather than unite his players, his bulldozing style, big mouth and rather unsubtle training regime has served only to divide. </p> <p>His constant outbursts against \"pointless fancy flicks\" have irritated Zidane; his complaints over lack of effort have got backs up, as have his very public harangues; his substitutions of Figo and Ronaldo, while leaving Ra\u00fal on (in central midfield!), have caused resentment and whispers of favourable treatment for his captain; and while there is perspiration now, there is little inspiration - Madrid have scored just twice in four games, with Roberto Carlos privately complaining that he is no longer allowed to attack. </p> <p>Camacho is a motivator but he has all the technical and tactical insight of a lump of plywood. Which is all well and good if your players are that talented. But when you lose the ability to motivate it is, as Camacho has admitted, time to walk. </p>",
  "<p>Further clear signs of a slowdown in the housing market emerged today as lenders said the amount of money borrowed for mortgages fell significantly in August. </p> <p>According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), total lending for mortgages slowed to \u00a325bn in August, 13% lower than in July and just 3% higher than August 2003. By contrast, July saw lending increase by 3% compared with June, and 13% compared with July 2003.</p> <p>People's appetite for buying houses seems to have cooled following five interest rate increases over the past year; lending to people buying property, as opposed to remortgaging, dropped by 18% between July and August to \u00a311.9bn. Mortgages for house purchase made up 48% of total lending, down from 51% in July.</p> <p>The number of loans made to people buying property fell by 20% to 104,000 in August, down from 130,000 in July and 116,000 in August last year. </p> <p>Fewer people were ready to take a chance on interest rates too. The proportion of people choosing variable rate mortgages, where monthly repayments go up and down along with the Bank of England's base rate decision, went down to 56%, compared with 60% in the previous month. </p> <p>The figures follow warnings from the Bank of England last week that house prices may see falls of up to 30%, while the National Association of Estate Agents said that eight out of 10 of its members believed prices had reached their peak.</p> <p>Michael Coogan, director general of the CML, said: \"This month's figures seem to suggest that the slowdown recorded by estate agents and reflected in recent approvals figures is beginning to make its way through the lending system.\" However, he added that we may be in for data showing \"bumpy\" progress in the market rather than a smooth, consistent slowdown. </p> <p>\"What does seem clear, taking all the market data together, is that the market is slowing down,\" Mr Coogan added. However, a crash in the property market may yet be averted: \"While we need to remain alert to the possibility that there could be a bounce back next year if consumers become complacent about the future direction of interest rates, all the evidence so far points to the likelihood of an orderly soft landing, in line with our expectations.\"</p> <p>The British Bankers Association (BBA), which released its lending figures today, said that mortgage lending had seen the weakest increase since June 2002, at \u00a34.4bn.</p> <p>David Dooks, BBA's director of statistics, said: \"Notably weaker mortgage growth in August came as no surprise following the sharp reduction in approvals seen in July and may be a sign that mortgage demand is moderating in the face of tighter household budgets and a slowing housing market.\" Figures released today by the Building Societies Association (BSA) told a similar story. Gross lending increased from \u00a33.8bn in August last year to \u00a34.7bn this year. However, approved loans; those that have been agreed but not yet completed, fell to \u00a33.6bn in August this year, down from \u00a33.9bn in August 2003. </p> <p>Adrian Coles, director general of the BSA, said the figures suggested we had \"reached a turning point in the housing market\".</p> <p>Commenting on today's lending figures, Howard Archer, economist at investment firm Global Insight, said: \"Evidence that the housing market is losing momentum is currently coming thick and fast. Markedly weaker mortgage lending and approvals in August, evident in the data today from the British Bankers Association, Building Societies Association and Council of Mortgage Lenders, points to a further softening in house prices in the near term at least. </p> <p>He added: \"It is still difficult to be totally confident that the housing market slowdown is more than just a temporary lull in activity, although we suspect that it is.\" </p> <p>Although the Bank of England is likely to be pleased by its success in reining in the property market, Mr Archer said a quarter point increase in interest rates was still likely in November.</p>",

  "Of the new breed of young Turks who are currently dominating Liberal Democrat thinking, Ed Davey is one of the most plausible. His name always comes up high on any \"future leader\" list. He's smart-suited, media-literate and bright. He makes no secret of the fact that he didn't totally expect to win his Kingston and Surbiton constituency at the last election, and was banking on another five years as a management consultant before entering parliament. But here he is: an MP, and determined not to waste his time. <p>For a long time the Liberal Democrats have been seen as the party of dreamers, idealists, eccentrics and the bloody-minded. But careerists? In the Lib Dems? You have to be joking. Yet Davey, and his fellow self-styled young Turks, are careerists to their fingertips. </p> <p>Davey has a simple message for his party's conference this week, which is that the joke's over. If there is one thing he wants to get across, it is that he and his generation are entirely serious about power, and growing impatient with the older MPs who have grown comfortably used to oppositionism. </p> <p>\"My message to the party is that we should be more ambitious. I think we have a massive opportunity, and my only concern is that there are people in the party, both in parliament and in the country, who don't seem to recognise what a historic chance we've got,\" he says. There has been enough of eccentricity, enough amateurism, he believes; though part of being a professional, of course, is that he won't elaborate on who precisely among his colleagues are drowsy. </p> <p>He cites the obvious local, byelection and European successes. But Davey is keen to insist that those are not the most important issue any more. </p> <p>For the first time in a generation, the Liberal Democrat conference was taking place against the backdrop of three-party politics. \"You had that in the early 1980s; but now we clearly are in three-party-politics territory, where you could see us overtaking the Conservatives in terms of the share of the vote.\" </p> <p>At the last two general elections the party had been concentrating on making \"the initial breakthrough\", but it now found itself able to win seats in new areas, particularly the inner cities. </p> <p>\"I think this is really crucial, because in 1997 and 2001 we were part of a progressive agenda against the Conservative 18 years, and in the public's mind we were working together with a Labour agenda. There's been a clear shift in the public's mind now, where we are very distinctive from the Labour party, whether it's on the war, tuition fees, foundation hospitals, council tax, pensions and so on. </p> <p>\"That's meant that in key areas, particularly the cities, we are the major challengers, and that's where we could surprise people in the next election ... this is an election where it's Lib Dems versus Tories and Labour. We will win seats off both of them.\" </p> <p>On Hartlepool, he does the expected business of talking up the party's candidate, but doesn't sound exactly ebullient: \"The danger is we've become a bit complacent about byelections with those huge swings we achieved in Brent, Leicester, and Hodge Hill, which we almost won. Hartlepool will be close, but we may just tip it.\" </p> <p>He does the usual Lib Dem number on whether the party should turn right or left. \"Labels are just not helpful ... no one has ever asked me on any doorstep anywhere, 'Are you a leftwing party or a rightwing party?' They want to know about your issues.\" </p> <p>But of course, the direction of the party will dominate this week's conference. Underlying the debates will be the themes identified in the Orange Book of essays, written by the party's brightest and best. </p> <p>The subjects range from local to global and are unsentimental in tone, with plenty of talk about \"tough Liberalism\" on crime, and the importance of the nation-state in the developing EU, even the repatriation of powers from Brussels. David Laws's proposal for a system of compulsory health insurance to replace NHS structures was swiftly disowned; and in general it is not hard to see why Charles Kennedy seems uneasy about the new grouping (many of whom call themselves New Liberals, in apparent mimicry of New Labour). </p> <p>Davey is brutally dismissive of David Laws's ideas on health: nobody wanted to run with compulsory insurance, which was in effect just another kind of tax. \"David should have debated something else, because then he'd have been ahead of the debate rather than behind it.\" Davey would prefer the tax-funded, decentralised Danish system. </p> <p>In general, though, he is aggressively boosterish about the \"New Liberals\". \"One of the big shifts, post-97, has been the enormous talent pool that's been created within the parliamentary party and outside,\" he says, listing \"Dr Vincent Cable, former chief economist of Shell, an absolute expert on international economics ... Chris Huhne who is likely to come in, having been an MEP, one of the most influential in the European party, a highly respected economic commentator of many decades; David Laws, double first from Cambridge in economics, retired before he was 30 as a millionaire from the City; Nick Clegg, who was chef de cabinet in Sir Leon Brittan's department, dealing with international trade and certainly no slouch ... Steve Webb, probably parliament's expert on pensions. </p> <p>\"I've just got a degree in postgraduate economics ... compared to my colleagues I'm just a junior. I would suggest that team could knock the spots off any team the other parties can put together. There's no doubt we could run this country.\" </p> <p>It is worth hearing him at length for that tone - punchy, pushy, even slightly arrogant, and not what we are accustomed to from Liberal Democrats. Davey insists that \"the young Turks, people in their mid to late 30s, didn't join it [the party] to make up the numbers. We joined it because we want to be in government. We're a bunch of intelligent, hard working, committed Liberal Democrats, and there's a lot of us, and not just in parliament. </p> <p>\"They've got a taste and a hunger for government. And this is what I'm trying to get out to some of the other people in the party, people who have been around a while; to say, look, this chance doesn't come along very often. We had it in the early 80s when the Tory party was seen to be out of touch with the country under Thatcher, and Foot's Labour party was marching off in one direction - and we didn't quite get it together.\" </p> <p>He clearly fears that happening again, despite this being \"a time when Blair is no longer trusted, all the gloss has come off New Labour, there's no excitement about Michael Howard\". </p> <p>The messages the party must get over are, it turns out, about wooing key groups of voters, particularly women, on bread-and-butter issues such as pensions and tax. Strikingly, for instance, he defends the proposal for a 50% top rate on high incomes in purely electoral terms: \"There aren't many individuals who earn above \u00a3100,000 ... less than 1% of the population. I know the Tory vote has fallen, but it hasn't fallen that much.\" </p> <p>So, not too much high-minded waffle about that.

  "<p>This October, the BBC is overseeing the launch of a new copyright licence. It is a small but necessary step towards realising one of the most visionary projects that the corporation has announced in decades - the Creative Archive. Although it may not seem obvious at first mention, the copyright licence, and the man behind it, show just how groundbreaking the archive promises to be. </p> <p>The Creative Archive will upload thousands of hours of archive BBC footage on to the internet to be watched again and reused by the public. As well as catering to curiosity-seekers eager to watch old footage from the 60s to the present day, the archive will provide students, teachers and amateur film-makers with a large body of material to reuse in non-commercial projects. </p> <p>The project exploits the BBC's position as a publicly funded broadcaster in a very clever way. Whereas most media organisations depend on controlling distribution of their products for their bread and butter income, the BBC has a charter obligation to make its products as free and accessible as possible. So while the majority of media companies continue to fret over internet piracy, the corporation can concentrate on getting involved in the broadband revolution. Peer-to-peer file-sharing will be central to the archive's distribution strategy. </p> <p>Paula Le Dieu, joint director of the project, wants the archive to become \"the fuel for creative endeavours in the UK\". She stresses the central ability to \"use the material in a way that the internet allows you to use digital assets\". But the UK copyright law has stood firmly in the way of such a resource up to now. This is because there has been no way for individuals or organisations to formally release works into the public domain the way the BBC proposes to do. Copyright law automatically grants \"all rights reserved\" to the author of a work, not just the right to commercially gain from the work, but the rights to distribution and to derivative works. </p> <p>When the BBC decided to release the Creative Archive for the British public to freely remix and reuse, therefore, it was presented with a significant legal challenge. Enter Lawrence Lessig, the Stanford law professor who last year asked the US supreme court to declare current copyright legislation unconstitutional. </p> <p>Lessig helped the corporation meet its legal challenge. It is his Creative Commons licence that the BBC has refashioned to get the archive off the ground. The history of this licence is embedded in a wider struggle against the current copyright system, and is Lessig's attempt to design some flexibility back into a system he believes will choke internet-enabled innovation. \"It is incredible that at a time when we have an unprecedented power to distribute ideas around the world, we have a growing body of restrictive intellectual property law that forbids us to do so,\" he says. </p> <p>Lessig first became interested in the public value of the internet when he noticed that, by letting anybody plug a computer into the ends of the network and instantly serve up their own opinions and media tools to the world, the net was fostering a new and expansive intellectual commons. This commons was producing rapid innovations, grassroots tools such as <a href=\"http://www.faxyourmp.com\">faxyourmp.com</a>, ambitious collaborative endeavours such as <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">wikipedia.org</a>, Alexandrian archive projects like <a href=\"http://www.archive.org\">archive.org</a> and the many blogs which are starting to change our ideas about the independent press. </p> <p>Lessig's three books - Code, The Future of Ideas and Free Culture - chart the expanding body of intellectual property legislation that will choke this innovation. Any idea about fair use of copyrighted material, he argues, requires a prohibitively expensive team of lawyers to defend it. Valuable online archive projects are prevented from digitising 50-year-old films by the obligation to locate for themselves every last actor and ask permission first. The quasi-perpetual copyright terms lately secured in the US, and heading swiftly for the EU, are steering us towards a new feudalism that will stunt the growth of the knowledge economy. </p> <p>Lessig explains this idea: \"The fight against feudalism was the fight against property regimes that had become so expansive and cumbersome that they choked off innovation and competitive growth. Much of the progress of the common law in England was the process of limiting the burdens of property law, so that property could become something you could transfer - use, reuse, and the competitive market could take off. Now we've recreated feudalism in the context of intellectual property.\" </p> <p>Lessig is unequivocally not anti-copyright. Copyright law, he insists, must exist in a form which protects and incentivises creators. But it must also allow the eventual transference of ideas in order to promote progress. History teaches us, he argues, that when a new technology emerges that changes the way we transfer ideas; be it radio, film or cable TV, copyright law is re-examined. </p> <p>The Creative Commons licence was developed by Lessig and his team as a bottom-up approach to re-examining copyright law, after the top-down approach (his trip to the supreme court) failed. It manipulates existing law to create an environment of \"some rights reserved\", giving creators the power to take the feudal burdens out of the copyright system. Under Creative Commons, writers and artists choose which rights they want to keep, the exploitation of their work for commercial gain, say, while relinquishing other rights, for example, on distribution and derivative use. </p> <p>Free Culture was released under a Creative Commons licence: it can be accessed from Lessig's website. The Canadian science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, whose collection of short stories A Place So Foreign and Eight More recently beat Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake to claim the 2004 Sunburst award, releases his work under Creative Commons. Doctorow attributes his critical and commercial success to the swift dissemination of his works permitted by the internet. </p> <p>With the BBC now endorsing the ideas behind it, the profile of Creative Commons is likely to grow. Lessig, Le Dieu states, has been a \"terrific inspiration\". The Creative Archive is being seen as a \"core part of how the BBC wants to relate to audiences in the future\" and it is likely that Lessig's ideas will be receiving a lot more scrutiny in the UK. </p> <p>Lessig explains the modern apathy towards the public domain by evoking a \"Stalinist era of mass media, where we have become passive receptors of our own culture\" and stresses the need to get back to \"the idea of remixing [that] has been central to the creative process for much of the history of creativity\". A rebalanced copyright law, he argues, will ensure digital media owners can profit from works while simultaneously allowing these works to be subverted and expanded upon in the internet-driven public domain. </p> <p>The Creative Archive will show the commercial world what happens when these ideas are put into practice, and an external panel of commercial stakeholders has already been established at the BBC. Lessig believes the archive will \"drive economic development dramatically\". He likens it to the BBC's computer literacy project of the 1980s, which saw millions of BBC Micro computers distributed to Britain's schools. The Creative Archive upgrades the vision of digital literacy from code to content, and, Lessig insists, will not only \"drive demand for bandwidth, software and hardware tools in the UK to unprecedented levels\" but also create a new generation of savvy media consumers who \"instinctively understand how multimedia works\", putting the UK into pole position in the digital race. </p> <p>There are still significant barriers for the BBC to overcome, the most obvious of which is working with rights-holders outside the BBC (independent producers and actors commissioned by the BBC over its history) to include their work in the archive. Together with the release of the licence later this month a small, demonstrative selection of archive clips will be put online. </p> <p>The low-key release belies the emerging centrality of the Creative Archive to future BBC strategy since the change of leadership last spring. Under Greg Dyke, a bigger release had been planned, but, as Le Dieu puts it, \"we thought we were going to Brighton and now we're going to the moon, so we need to repack\". Lessig trusts the new direction to maintain the philosophy of Creative Commons: \"If you had asked me last year who would be the best man for the job, I would have pointed to Mark Thompson. When I put my ideas to him at Channel 4, he immediately got it: his next question was, right, how can we make this happen?\"</p>",
  "Britain is embroiled in a fresh conflict with Iraq as it battles to quash global terrorism for ever, Tony Blair declared in a stark relabelling of the situation yesterday. <p>The prime minister used a joint press conference with the Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, to say: \"Whatever the disagreements about the first conflict in Iraq to remove Saddam, in this conflict now taking place in Iraq, this is the crucible in which the future of this global terrorism will be decided. Either it will succeed and this terrorism will grow, or we will succeed, the Iraqi people will succeed and this global terrorism will be delivered a huge defeat,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Blair's fresh presentation of the chaos engulfing parts of Iraq came as the head of the army, General Sir Mike Jackson, admitted that British troops were now fighting \"a counter-insurgency war\". </p> <p>With 300 people killed last week, including three Kurdish hostages beheaded yesterday, he told the Sunday Telegraph: \"August was a very busy month and British soldiers were involved in war fighting.\" </p> <p>The relabelling - described by the Foreign Office as a \"new language\" - also comes a week before the Labour conference, at which Mr Blair can expect to face fury at his handling of the conflict. </p> <p>A YouGov poll at the weekend suggested that support for the conflict is at its lowest. Just 38% of people now believe the war was right, and 52% think it was wrong, compared with 66% who supported the war, and 29% who opposed it, when US troops entered Baghdad on April 10 2003. Women in particular appear to have withdrawn their support, with only 30% thinking troops should remain, compared with 47% of men. </p> <p>Mr Blair adopted a conciliatory tone, insisting he did not want to prevent debate over \"the wisdom of removing Saddam\" and acknowledging the conflict had been \"deeply divisive\". </p> <p>A day after a leaked report suggested he had not heeded warnings about the war aftermath, he said: \"There are all sorts of questions perfectly legitimately still asked about the information we had, about issues to do with weapons of mass destruction and so on, and I don't misunderstand the difficulties, even the anger ... about that\". </p> <p>But he insisted every \"sensible and decent person\" should move on and recognise that the terrorists and insurgents were opposed to \"every single one of the values we in countries like this hold dear\". </p> <p>\"Now is not the time for the international community to divide or disagree but to come together ... and realise that the struggle of the prime minister and the Iraqi people, for liberty and democracy and stability, is actually our struggle too.\" </p> <p>He rejected suggestions that the coalition and Iraqi forces were already losing the war against terror, but - acknowledging there was \"a real fight going on\" - indicated the scale of their difficulty. </p> <p>\"If we succeed in Iraq that's a huge blow to this form of terrorism. If we don't, then of course it's very serious. </p> <p>\"We are fighting and we will succeed because our determination and belief in our values is greater than the terrorists', and we are going to win.\" </p> <p>Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Mr Allawi appeared more defiant than Mr Blair in predicting \"success against the forces of evil\". He called for greater UN involvement, and said the January elections would go ahead, despite the carnage. \"We are adamant democracy is going to prevail in Iraq,\" he said. </p> <p>In an interview with ABC's This Week show, Mr Allawi said that Saddam and his lieutenants would go on trial next month. \"Roughly speaking, I think October,\" he said in the interview aired yesterday. </p> <p>He said he did not think the trial would take long because the evidence against Saddam was \"overwhelming\". </p> <p>The prime minister also made clear that British forces would be in Iraq for the long haul. While he described time frames of \"10, 15, 20 years\" as \"absurdly exaggerated\", he refused to put a limit on a period. </p> <p>\"It is foolish and dangerous for us to say, here is a date at which it's going to happen. The only thing people need to know in Iraq is we are not going to desert them in this. We will stay until the job is done.\" </p> <p>He said the two prime ministers had not discussed sending more British troops to Iraq, and preferred instead to build the capability of the Iraqi forces. </p> <p>Defence sources indicated that more than 1,000 extra British troops could be flown to Iraq at short notice. But a senior defence source said the situation would have to \"deteriorate massively\" before such a decision was made. </p> <p>After a brief respite when the interim Iraqi government took power in June, the violence has steadily worsened, culminating last week in bombings and shoot-outs that claimed more than 300 lives.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair's call on British businesses to take the moral lead on climate change is laudable and his encouragement to the UK renewable and low-carbon energy industry is welcome. But by tying renewables so closely to climate change, we are in danger of undervaluing them. </p> <p>Renewable and low-carbon energy are not just the long-term solutions to climate change. They are indispensable today if we are to cushion the British economy against volatile oil and gas prices and the impending peak in world oil production - not least the dwindling reserves in the North Sea. </p> <p>Thanks to the 1990s switch from coal to gas for electricity generation, the UK is better placed than most countries to meet its emissions reductions targets, agreed to under the Kyoto Protocol. </p> <p>This success on the issue of climate change has come at the cost of reduced diversity in energy sources. The UK is becoming a net importer of gas - and on current trends it will be importing three-quarters of its primary energy supplies by 2020. </p> <p>Faced with this problem, the nuclear power industry senses a new lease of life. </p> <p>Newspapers that campaign against wind farms on the grounds that they destroy the countryside are apparently keen to see nuclear power stations sprout across the gardens of England. </p> <p>It is difficult to foresee the Treasury paying the billions required for new nuclear power stations and nearly impossible to see the money coming from private finance. </p> <p>To be commercially viable, generation technologies should be fast to build and come in small increments so as to maintain the balance between demand and supply - especially where demand growth is weak. </p> <p>Currently available nuclear designs fail on both counts. They take five years or more to build - let alone plan - and come in chunks of 600 to 1,000 megawatts. </p> <p>Smaller scale forms of renewable generation, such as onshore and offshore wind, solar, wave and tidal, offer a more practical solution. They can be built quickly, are smaller in scale and - with the right government support - will be commercially competitive with fossil fuels within the next few years. </p> <p>You do not have to look far to see the fruits of such an approach. </p> <p>Denmark's 1970s diversification into alternative energy sources, most notably wind, has put it at the top of European league table for the deployment of renewable electricity generation and has resulted in the pre-eminence of Danish manufacturers in the international wind industry. </p> <p>Denmark's experience is all the more encouraging for the UK - which has better renewable resources, not just in wind but also in wave and tidal power. </p> <p>The best short-term strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is for the government to encourage increased energy efficiency in housing. Installing lagging in British lofts will have an immediate impact on emissions. However, it will do nothing to ensure the country is not held hostage by high imported oil and gas prices in the future. </p> <p>New government policies must therefore be worked out to encourage greater investment in renewables and low-carbon energy so that the UK's energy diversity is widened. </p> <p>This means broadening the scope beyond the renewables obligation, which increasingly appears something of a one-trick pony. Though the obligation has been effective in stimulating deployment of wind power, it provides little incentive to other emerging renewable technologies, which offer the prospect of genuine diversity in the medium term. </p> <p>Furthermore, the obligation's exclusive focus on power generation avoids obvious opportunities to utilise renewable energy sources in other markets, most notably heat and transport fuels. </p> <p>Given it is the oil price that lies at the heart of many security concerns and that the fuel crisis still looms large in the political psyche of this government, a sustained programme of support for biofuels in road transport is long overdue. </p> <p>Government encouragement and support to renewables on the grounds of security is an increasingly prudent course of action. </p> <p>Any complaints about the cost of subsidising renewables should be set against the likely pain that both industry and consumers could face in the long term - with continued volatility in oil and gas prices and an eventual peak in oil production. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Tony White and Graham Meeks are respectively head and director of Policy and Markets Analysis at specialist merchant banking firm Climate Change Capital</p>",
  "Every year since 1979 there has been a Big Garden Bird Watch, a nationwide survey organised by the RSPB. But I can't help contemplating a survey of a different species: a Big Outdoor Child Watch. I know only too well what it would find. Chicks are now pretty much extinct, outside their own nest areas and a shrinking number of poorly maintained reserves. Juveniles, common in the 1970s, declined in numbers throughout the 1980s and are now rarely seen away from their parents, except in impoverished areas. And adolescents, though not yet endangered, are seen as pests and controlled accordingly. In sum, children are fast disappearing from the outdoor environment, by far their preferred habitat. <p>The ecology of children apparently being less interesting than that of birds, there is little hard data around. We do have Mayer Hillman's classic One False Move, a study of children's independent mobility. It suggests that, in a single generation, the \"home habitat\" of a typical eight-year-old - the area in which children are able to travel on their own - has shrunk to one-ninth of its former size. Do not underestimate the significance of this change: for the first time in the 4m-year history of our species, we are effectively trapping children indoors at the very point when their bodies and minds are primed to start getting to grips with the world outside the home. </p> <p>Taking an ecological perspective not only dramatises these childhood changes, it also sheds light on their consequences. Research from the young of other species shows that captivity causes a fall in physical, cognitive, social and emotional competences. In children, at risk is what naturalists might term survival mechanisms, but what psychologists call resilience. </p> <p>Sceptics may ask about the relevance of animal findings to our own species. But there's a lot of supporting evidence. Health experts agree that the decline in outdoor play is linked to child obesity - a position supported by recent research on children's activity levels from Professor Roger Mackett at UCL. And Sharon Witherspoon from the Nuffield Foundation was quoted in these pages only last week as saying \"we are doing something peculiarly unhelpful for adolescent mental health in Britain\". </p> <p>The decline is, in part, a side effect of wider social changes. Shrinking families, more parents working longer hours and increasingly fragmented communities have left children with fewer friendly faces to look out for them. Many more children have their own rooms, and the entertainment industry makes ever more seductive indoor offers to stave off cabin fever. </p> <p>Fear plays a key role: parents' fears of traffic (probably justified) and strangers (arguably not), and children's fear of crime and bullying. There is growing hostility to children in public space. Behaviour that would a few years ago have been \"larking about\" is now labelled antisocial, and parents fear being judged harshly if their kids are seen out of doors unaccompanied. </p> <p>There is precious little outdoor play space: Audit Commission figures show that each child under 12 has a \"ration\" of 2.3sq metres - about the size of a kitchen table. As for the quality of facilities, the Children's Play Council quotes one child - surely not unrepresentative of the bigger picture - telling it like it is: \"Go to the park - it's rubbish.\" </p> <p>Government is not immune from blame. Politicians and Whitehall mandarins insist on hard evidence of the benefits of outdoor play, the implied message to children being, \"We'll only let you out if you prove to us it'll do you good.\" Chris Smith is one exception. In 2001, he secured a Labour pre-election commit ment to spend \u00a3200m of National Lottery funding on play. Frank Dobson is another. He chaired the review I worked on to shape the promised programme, and is not afraid to say in public that children need to \"lark about\". But eight months after our report, Getting Serious About Play, was published, we are still waiting to hear the outcome. </p> <p>A positive government response to the Dobson report would dramatically raise the profile of playgrounds and play services. And not just children would benefit: many local communities have found new life and energy through playground improvement projects, something the charity Groundwork can confirm. </p> <p>But as with birds, so with children: their presence all over the place, in diversity and numbers, is a sure sign of a healthy human habitat. To achieve that, our transport and planning priorities need to change, including such measures as 20mph speed limits in the streets where children live. That, in turn, implies a change in adult attitudes - something that pessimists say just isn't going to happen. </p> <p>The success of home zones - child-friendly streets - suggests the pessimists might be wrong. They show that many local communities want to live in habitats where the noise of children playing outside is not a sign of neglect but a sound to raise the spirits. Like the first cuckoo of spring. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tim Gill is outgoing director of the Children's Play Council; he gives his valedictory lecture at the National Children's Bureau, London EC1, at 6.30pm tonight </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tim@rethinkingchildhood.com\">tim@rethinkingchildhood.com</a></p>",
  "<p>House prices are static nationally and are continuing to fall in London as the traditional autumn pick-up fails to materialise, says a survey out today. </p> <p>At \u00a3192,300, the average asking price for a house in England and Wales is unchanged on a month ago, says the property website Rightmove. </p> <p>Prices are weaker for lower value properties, with terraced homes and flats down by an average of \u00a35,000 since July. Buyers \"seem reluctant to commit\", says the company. First-time buyers and buy-to-let investors are notable by their absence. The average asking price is still 16.4% higher than a year ago. </p> <p>Rightmove said the property market was in \"a readjustment phase\". Five interest rate rises and fears that the Bank of England might impose further rate hikes were draining activity and contributing to an uncertain environment in which buyers were reluctant to commit. </p> <p>The company's commercial director, Miles Shipside, said: \"The market seems in a stalemate, with prices static and relatively low levels of activity as buyers wait for a clearer idea of where we are going.\" </p> <p>The national picture disguises wide regional variations, with typical asking prices in London down 0.7% over the past month to \u00a3276,664, but prices in the east Midlands up 1.5%. Nevertheless, the average London home is on the market for 10% more than it was a year ago. </p> <p>With the move from a seller's to a buyer's market, Rightmove warns that overly optimistic asking prices \"just won't stick in this environment\". </p> <p>The company's findings are based on the asking prices of properties marketed by several thousand estate agency branches.</p>",
  "<p>Law firms come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny operations in the high street to the massive City firms so big they have their own ecosystems. When it comes to choosing where to work, size is indeed important, but not always in the ways you might imagine.</p> <p>\"There's quite a difference between the mentality of a Magic Circle firm and a smaller firm,\" says Anna Wallbank, director of the legal temps department at recruitment consultancy Career Legal. \"With the Magic Circle, you'll be working for one specific partner and three or four other fee-earners, all specialising in one particular kind of work. At a smaller place, you'll be far more hands-on and probably doing a bit of everything.\"</p> <p>If you like being directly responsible for the smooth running of the firm, there is a lot to be said for work at the smaller end of the spectrum, where everyone is expected to take on tasks beyond the purely secretarial. But if you see such duties as frustrating interruptions, then a firm big enough to have entire departments designed to relieve you of extraneous matters could be very appealing.</p> <p>\"We get a huge amount of support,\" says Amanda Fairfield, a legal secretary in Freshfields' financial services and regulatory team. \"There are phone, fax and IT departments and a travel department, which will make all the arrangements for you. Then there's a general helpline for if anything else breaks or goes wrong. It leaves you free to concentrate on the job itself.\" </p> <p>While solicitors' hours at larger firms are notoriously long, their secretaries are generally protected from the worst excesses of client demands. Evening staff are brought in if late-night help is needed, and the largest firms have WP support teams working 24/7.</p> <p>At a high-street firm, it's more often a case of all hands to the pumps for as long as it takes for the workload to be cleared. The big boys also offer benefits and perks that are beyond the means of their smaller brethren. In-house gyms, season-ticket loans, private healthcare, on-site doctors and dentists, cash machines, drycleaners and subsidised shops and restaurants are commonplace. Some go even further - Baker Mackenzie, for example, have a five-star chef, formerly of the Ivy, feeding their fortunate employees.</p> <p>In the face of this, what can smaller firms possibly have to offer? \"A more family feel,\" says Anna Wallbank. \"It's a far less commercial environment and you can feel a lot more involved.\" Karen Watts, who worked for a high-street firm before moving to the in-house legal department of a huge City management consultancy, agrees.</p> <p>\"The high-street firm was friendly, relaxed, everyone knew everyone and you got more responsibility, which was great. At the other one, my boss found it hard to remember my name when he came back from a business trip. The staff were really competitive, there was no team spirit. You had to tell two people if you were going to the toilet. It was pathetic. I'm still scarred.\" </p> <p>Claire Emmersley too has fond memories of working for a small criminal law firm. \"The solicitors were really nice, even though things were often more hectic for them. And all the secretaries looked out for each other, too. The only downside was that if you were ill, you felt even worse for knowing everybody you were putting out.\"</p> <p>Watts and Emmersley now work for mid-sized City firms and are adamant that they have achieved the best of both worlds. \"It's big enough not to be cliquey but small enough still to be friendly,\" says Watts, a sentiment which Emmersley echoes. \"You're a bit more of 'just a number' of course,\" she says. \"But you still get to know everybody and I wanted to get into the City but was too young and quiet to cope with a really big firm.\" She adds that although she doesn't get any perks, her basic salary compares very favourably with her friends who have gone down that route.</p> <p>So - would you prefer anonymity coupled with an avalanche of emoluments, or to be a known face in a slightly less well-off crowd? It seems that in the legal, as in the fashion world, one size does not fit all.</p>",
  "<p>It's late, it's dark, and the torrent of commuters that poured out of offices and into waiting trains and buses two hours earlier has slowed to a trickle. By the time you make it to the suburbs, the quiet streets are deserted. You've made the same journey for years, but still feel a slight sense of relief when you finally put the key in your own front door. </p> <p>Modern working practices have little time for the old nine-to-five. We're being encouraged to work later hours, to embrace shift-work, and to take our place as facilitators of the 24-hour society. It's not always a bad thing. Flexible hours allow us to fit work around childcare, for example, or combine careers and study. But it does mean that more and more employees are travelling to and from work without the safety of the crowd. </p> <p>One result of this is the growing demand for self-defence and personal safety courses aimed specifically at employees. More and more companies who make their staff work irregular hours feel duty bound to provide basic self-defence training in return. </p> <p>\"Personal safety provision is a growing trend,\" says Jessica Jarvis, training and development adviser for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), \"It's part of a wider trend of corporate well-being initiatives trying to demonstrate to staff that the company takes their welfare seriously. It's another way of telling them that the company appreciates them.\" </p> <p>In other words, your company's decision to let you spend a day beating up the boss might not be entirely altruistic. \"The feedback I have received from employees and employers alike is that the motivation and productivity of the workforce who have taken part in this type of training has increased,\" says Liz Clark, founder of Women's Self Defence, which runs courses for major City banks and legal firms, police force civilian staff, and local councils and universities. \"The employee feels that they are valued and that their employer is taking an active interest in their welfare inside and outside of the working environment.\" </p> <p>And the usual day-out-of-the-office advantages apply. Self-defence training is physical exercise. Hitting things is a great stress buster, and team-building is integral to the course. \"People pair up with colleagues who they might never meet during the course of a working day,\" says Clark. \"It's especially pleasing when you see the secretary practising the physical intervention techniques with one of the chief executives.\" </p> <p>Self-defence training also promotes confidence, which is good news when it comes to delivering an important presentation or facing down a workplace bully. Learning to react rationally in confrontational situations is an integral part of many personal safety training courses. </p> <p>But self-defence courses are also about, well, self-defence. As well as late-night commuting, some \"people-facing\" office staff have to confront intimidating behaviour and even the threat of physical violence. Last year 376,000 British workers were attacked at work. Employees of large organisations with dispersed offices can find themselves working away in unfamiliar areas. The threat of terrorism, however slight, is a cause for concern in some prominently positioned buildings. And many staff now take work home with them, which often means documents of a sensitive nature and expensive company laptops. The risks associated with this were starkly demonstrated recently, when documents relating to Maxine Carr's release from prison were stolen from a civil servant's car. </p> <p>Awareness and avoidance of risk are the first principles of any self-defence or personal safety course. \"It's about being switched on,\" says Clark. This can mean planning work-related journeys in advance and learning to recognise potentially dangerous situations before they arise. On the other hand, it can be as simple as thinking about where you park the car or making a habit of reporting suspicious or unattended baggage. </p> <p>Floyd Brown, self-defence expert and former director of the National Register of Personal Trainers, agrees that one of the most important lessons in a course for office staff is learning to avoid problems in the first place, and learning to \"de-escalate\" dangerous confrontations before they get out of hand. But such courses don't shy away from the tough stuff when necessary. Brown says that the practical self-defence techniques he teaches employees include \"striking pain receptive targets\" - and I think we all know which targets he's talking about - \"and escaping quickly from hand grips and strangle holds.\" At the end of one of his courses, energised employees can spend time practising their new found skills - and beating away a few frustrations - on a man in full body armour. </p> <p>And some experts are suggesting that basic self-defence and security training should be as compulsory in the workplace as the fire drill, and that companies have a duty to help protect employees who work late into the night, even when they are off company premises. \"Employers have a duty of care for employees,\" says Jessica Jarvis. \"At the very least, they should be raising awareness of any dangers.\" </p> <p>Brown goes further. \"To my mind, this type of training should be statutory if the employer is seriously concerned with the welfare of their employees,\" he says. \"It would demonstrate a realisation of the potential risks employees face, and show an appreciation of the commitment being shown by the hardworking staff who are working such long hours.\"</p>",
  "<p>Early last Wednesday morning a group of casually dressed people gathered tensely on the third floor of BBC Television Centre. For a journalist trying to gauge the power of television schedulers - the people who decide when programmes should go out and where - there was no better place to be. </p> <p>Forty-eight hours earlier, Liam Keelan, the scheduler of BBC1, had spotted a big problem. He had finally been able to watch finished episodes of BBC1's prestigious British Isles - A Natural History, presented by Alan Titchmarsh, a show that was already being heavily promoted to viewers. But, he suddenly realised, the eight-part series was too demanding for the 8pm slot that it had been allocated for next Wednesday (29 September). \"It's a sit down and concentrate series,\" he said. He decided it would have to switch from 8pm to 9pm, and informed BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey. </p> <p>This one change, however, had a major knock-on effect on BBC2, BBC3 and BBC4, which try to run complementary programmes. To accommodate British Isles, Keelan decided to switch What Not To Wear (previously on BBC2 but now showing on BBC1) from 9pm to 8pm, causing major disruption for BBC2, which had scheduled Who Rules the Roost?, a programme on parenting, for 8pm. This meant two shows with similar (female) audiences airing simultaneously. Clearly this was an impossibility. </p> <p>So on Wednesday morning, with a cut-off deadline of 2.30pm looming - after which it would be impossible to make further changes - George Dixon, the BBC2 scheduler, pulled forward the start of Challenge - a series for men about major explorations. The schedule made sense again. </p> <p>So why the deadline? Well, it is all part of the scheduling game. Every Friday afternoon, the main broadcasters are required by law to publish and exchange their (draft) schedules for two weeks ahead. As part of the elaborate mixture of skulduggery and bluffing that goes on, there are always some gaps, marked TBA - to be announced. The schedulers then have until 2.30pm the following Wednesday to make final changes to avoid clashes, so the television listings magazines can hit their deadlines - hence the tense group I witnessed. </p> <p>There was also tension across town last Wednesday at Channel 4, where its scheduler, Jules Oldroyd, was at action stations. Oldroyd was shocked by the appearance of The Farm, Five's new nightly reality show, which launches next Sunday at 10pm. \"If it takes off, it's a real bugger\" and a commercial blow, said her boss Rosemary Newall, controller of broadcasting and scheduling. </p> <p>The Farm is made by Endemol, of Big Brother fame. So for grimly commercial competitive reasons, Channel 4 decided to slip in the film Gladiator, which runs for three and half hours, at 9pm. Oldroyd also moved Ali G in America to 11.30pm on Friday and before it put in an hour of The Osbournes instead of the scheduled half hour. This is a temporary measure that prepares the way for changes to be announced this Friday. Oldroyd decided that Channel 4 needed an hour long \"recut\" of its new talent show, Kings of Comedy. Endemol duly drafted in a new team. This is expected to bolster C4's \"Friday is entertainment night\" theme against Jonathan Ross on BBC1 - a show coveted by all schedulers. </p> <p>At ITV, by contrast, things were calm. Seasoned scheduler David Bergg had made changes the previous week to reinstate The Bill at 8pm on Wednesday and move Coronation Street Family Albums - which his rivals all gleefully pointed out to me had not worked - to 10pm. And the opposition have decided Steel River Blues also isn't working. But Bergg was thrilled that the one-off Alan Plater drama Belonging, starring Brenda Blethyn, had worked so well. </p> <p>Behind the scenes at every television channel there is a small bunch of anonymous yet powerful people, typically in their 30s or early 40s, who draw up schedules. On their computers are stored precious trade secrets, mapping schedules three years ahead. They spend their time worrying simultaneously about 2006/7 and what's going out that night. They constantly ask questions such as \"When is the next I'm A Celebrity starting?\" And at 9.45 each morning, when the \"overnights\" - Barb audience data - are released, they will all be glued to their computers. </p> <p>Not one of them has ever made a programme (see panel): most trained in audience research, or media/ sales. Being a programme-maker is regarded as a positive disadvantage because detachment is all. They are fiercely competitive and watch each other and their schedules like hawks. </p> <p>Adam MacDonald, who scheduled BBC2 and BBC1 before making a (rare) switch to commissioning, becoming controller of Channel 4 daytime, says: \"You have to know and love telly. You have to stare at spreadsheets all day and see TV in them, understand how audiences behave. You're not a programme-maker, but you need a good editorial head.\" Schedulers are also political. \"It sounds a bit cynical,\" says MacDonald, \"but you also schedule with an eye to what will get good reviews.\" </p> <p>An occupational hazard for all of them is that many television programmes - dramas and documentaries in particular - don't match expectations. They may not do what they say on the can. They may even be untransmittable. Apart from such staples as soaps, Richard &amp; Judy, The Weakest Link and Countdown, schedulers dare not take anything on trust. For example, Keelan says that the recent BBC1 police drama 55 Degrees North was commissioned for 8pm on Sundays, but when it came in it had a prostitution theme. So it had to go at 9pm on a weekday. </p> <p>Programmes can also suffer in the time lag between commission and broadcast. Channel 4 ordered Don't Worry, a 7.30pm puppet-based current affairs series, from Fulcrum Productions for this autumn. But the incoming director of television, Kevin Lygo, changed the plan: Friday is for entertainment. \"Sometimes a show is pushed to midnight, a victim of the fact that we don't have the slots,\" says Newall. </p> <p>Schedulers can be deeply unpopular. \"You put on your body armour when you come to work,\" she adds. Dixon says: \"You have to be resilient to abuse which comes from all sources.\" \"If you've made a programme, it's your baby, and the biggest disappointment is if it's not right for a slot. It can't be good news all the time,\" says Keelan. </p> <p>But schedulers are also the last common sense line of defence when tragedy occurs and controllers are away. They go through schedules to weed out offensive/ inappropriate programmes. At Channel 4 a film on September 9 called Arlington Road was dropped because it began with a man carrying a wounded boy. </p> <p>At ITV the commercial requirement to hold audience share forces it to shelve poorly performing peak-time series, most recently typified by the drama Making Waves. \"ITV's behaviour is pretty shoddy, a knee-jerk reaction, it really pisses people off. In television we tend to forget that one million is a lot of people,\" says Newall. \"We try not to do it.\" </p> <p>Apart from the daily exercise of compiling the \"television jigsaw\", the schedulers are involved, as Keelan says, \"in all commissioning decisions\", in his case for BBC1. This is another key to their power. They attend the seasonal big rounds of commissioning and routine weekly meetings on drama, factual, entertainment, etc, alongside the channel controllers. They are in constant touch. </p> <p>\"Lorraine Heggessey says it's like being married, without the sex,\" quips Keelan. \"Joined at the hip,\" says Newall, \"You have to get on.\" Bergg spends every Friday with ITV Network director Nigel Pickard in his study in his Kent farmhouse, watching programmes, plotting moves. Ian Lewis expects to speak to James Baker, head of Sky One, by phone \"even when I'm away on holiday\". </p> <p>Jane Root, the former controller of BBC2, says: \"Schedulers understand your audience, they're your right- hand person.\" Dixon helped to devise BBC2's current Sunday evening schedules, skewed towards male viewers, avoiding soppy drama, with programmes such as Top Gear. SAS: Are You Tough Enough? was commissioned as a series of half-hour programmes until Dixon suggested sticking them together as one hours, turning Sunday nights into one of the best evenings for BBC2. Then it was decided to use it to launch 24, and the trick of screening the next episode immediately after on BBC3 - a device avidly copied by everyone else. </p> <p>\"You are worried the whole time. You think about television all day and when you go home, you can't switch off, you switch on,\" says Dixon. That is why they all have a fresh perspective on Big Brother: they cite Channel 4's decision to strip it nightly as \"incredibly brave\", committing weeks and weeks to scheduling something when you don't know what it will be like. </p> <p>All have problems: BBC1 has those Wednesday night dips, no East- Enders and the challenge of being more worthy. BBC2's big challenge is to reduce the number of lifestyle and leisure shows, which are cheap, and replace them with something else. Ray Mears' Extreme Survival is one answer. And the 6-7.30pm slot without The Simpsons is an experiment. BBC3 is discussing doing football, in a BBC3 way. </p> <p>But in a multichannel, Sky Plus environment, do schedulers have a future? \"Oh God, yes,\" says Keelan. Bergg is gloomier: \"It'll be dead, perhaps in five years, with the explosion of choice, via broadband, video on demand. Scheduling will continue, but will be a less powerful factor. The content of shows, their marketing and distribution will be more important.\" Newall disputes this: \"People have had video recorders yet the majority watch live TV. We like the fact that other people are doing the same thing at the same time. I wouldn't sign up to the belief that we'll be all out of business.\" But it is safe to say they are all watching Adam MacDonald's progress on the other side of the business with interest. </p> <p><strong>They saw it first: the schedulers</strong></p> <p><strong> Liam Keelan, scheduler, BBC1</strong> </p> <p>Age 37. He has a degree in German from Warwick University. In 1995, he became an audience researcher for BBC Radio, then did stints with BBC Daytime, BBC2 and UKTV. He moved to become scheduler for BBC1 in 2002. He is a gritty Liverpudlian, who turned ITV's trick of running drama two-parters on Sundays and Mondays to BBC1's advantage. </p> <p><strong> George Dixon, scheduler, BBC2</strong> </p> <p>Age 33. He has a degree from Bournemouth University in communications and psychology. In 1992, joined the BBC in marketing, becoming commissioning assistant and moving into scheduling in 1997. No programming-making experience. Spotted gap for male programmes - Top Gear, 24 and SAS: Are You Tough Enough? - on Sunday nights. </p> <p><strong> David Bergg, ITV director of programme strategy</strong> </p> <p>Age 46. He has a degree in history and international politics from Durham University. With a background in audience research at LWT, he has been scheduler at BBC1 and ITV and controller at Sky One and ITV2. His nickname is \"master of the dark art\". </p> <p><strong> Rosemary Newall, controller broadcasting and scheduling, Channel 4</strong> </p> <p>Age 41. She has a history degree from Exeter University. Her background is in audience research at the BBC, and she became chief scheduler there, training a small group of top schedulers. She joined Channel 4 in 1997. </p> <p><strong> Jules Oldroyd, scheduler, Channel 4</strong> </p> <p>Age 39. She has a degree in economics from the LSE. She trained in advertising sales at TVS and Channel 4, then joined Newall in programme planning and strategy. Has never made a programme. She was the key executive at Channel 4 who took home tapes of Operatunity, and recommended it be played at 9pm. Now Channel 4's next arts binge, Musicality, in which amateurs compete to sing in a West End musical, starting November, is slated to run at 9pm. </p> <p><strong> Susanna Dinnage</strong> , <strong> scheduler, Five</strong> </p> <p>Age 37. She has a degree in French from the University of Kent. Her background is in consumer/audience research for MTV Europe. She joined Five in 1996 to work with David Brook, former marketing director, and became scheduler in 2003. Says she is proud of helping to make it a channel people consider staying with for the evening - rather than the default channel people watch if nothing else is fancied. </p> <p><strong> Ian Lewis, director of broadcasting Sky Networks, who schedules Sky One</strong></p> <p>Age 41. He has a degree in maths and economics from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Previously a media buyer at Zenith Media - where he made his name with caustic notes on upcoming ITV programmes.

He says: \"The only time I don't speak to James [Baker, head of Sky One] is Christmas Day.\" </p> <p><strong> Damian Kavanagh, scheduler, BBC3</strong> </p> <p>Age 35. He has a degree in philosophy from University College, Dublin. He worked for RTE before moving to BBC as a trainee assistant, channel management; worked on BBC Choice, the precursor of BBC3, where US drama 24 was part of the now widely copied switch over scheduling breakthrough in which audiences watch one episode on BBC2, and can then switch over to BBC3 to watch the next episode.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> With Cherie Blair admitting last week that she didn't realise that eBay was a public site that could be tracked by the press (eh?), the auction phenomenon is having to look elsewhere for publicity. Traditionally, the company has relied on a clever combination of word of mouth and online advertising to drive users to the site, but Diary has heard that later this year it plans to launch its first UK TV and radio advertising campaign. Although, to be honest, you would have thought the site gets enough free publicity as it is. The most successful brands, like Google and Amazon, have all eschewed TV ads since the dotcom bust. It will be interesting to see whether eBay's decision persuades others to follow suit. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> As the broadband revolution continues apace, film download service CinemaNow is coming to the UK courtesy of internet service provider Tiscali. We will be watching avidly to see whether it proves as successful in the UK as it has in the US, given that most broadband subscribers on this side of the Atlantic have slower connections. But with the launch of CinemaNow, the recent announcement about Napster's portable library service and the momentum gathering behind portable video players, the next year or so should prove fascinating. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> BBC director of new media Ashley Highfield comes off well in Greg Dyke's new book, Inside Story, published today. \"Ashley is one of the most inventive people I know and our one-on-one monthly meetings were among the most creative and stimulating I had in my time as director general ... With my limited knowledge of new media I enjoyed testing his ideas and acting as his technically illiterate sounding board.\" Translation: I hadn't the faintest idea what he was going on about but was happy to let him get on with it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> MSN Messenger is sponsoring MTV's new Icon award, which last Friday was awarded to '80s doom mongers the Cure. But Diary couldn't help chuckling at the comments of Dave Sibley, MTV's snappily titled senior vice president and general manager, international marketing partnerships, on the press release announcing the partnership. In his best David Brent voice, he says: \"In partnership with MTV Europe, MSN will be able to deliver a compelling youth marketing campaign and leverage awareness and brand loyalty of MSN messenger in a credible and impactful way.\" Phew. Rock'n'roll, eh? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Still on the subject of MSN Messenger, Diary hears that a global agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo, the two biggest players and competing standards in the instant messaging world, might not be too far away. At present, the situation mirrors the very early days of mobile phones, when subscribers to different networks couldn't talk to each other. Once a compromise is reached, expect the technology to become even more popular and prevalent.</p>",
  "<p>When Sheikh Mohammed's global breeding operation lost Dubai Millennium barely a season into his stud career, it was arguably the most significant setback in Sheikh Mohammed's long career on the turf. But the man who created Godolphin has never been one to dwell on misfortune, and having all but cornered the market in Dubai Millennium's offspring, yesterday he enjoyed his first Group One victory with a son of his favourite horse. </p> <p>Dubawi was the talk of Newmarket even before he made his racecourse debut at Goodwood in June, and yesterday he took his career record to three wins in as many starts with a smooth success in the National Stakes at The Curragh. He was the ante-post favourite for next year's Derby with most bookmakers even before he entered the stalls. Having returned three lengths ahead of Berenson, with Russian Blue back in third, he is now as short as 10-1 with Ladbrokes for next season's Epsom Classic. </p> <p>Russian Blue, representing Aidan O'Brien, cut out most of the running, but Frankie Dettori always had Dubawi, the 8-13 favourite, poised in behind. When asked for an effort, Dubawi soon went clear, and though he idled a little in front, he kept on well to secure what may well be his last victory as a two-year-old. </p> <p>\"He travelled like a good horse and I set him alight a furlong and a half out,\" Dettori said. \"He was a bit cheeky with me and looked at the crowd but he won like a really good horse. I like his attitude and he is a great prospect for next year.\" </p> <p>Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, suggested afterwards that three from three and a Group One is a fair return for Dubawi's first season. \"To have a son of Dubai Millennium win a Group One is a great day for Godolphin and he is now very much a Classic prospect for next year,\" Crisford said. \"Sheikh Mohammed had indicated that that would probably be it for this season.\" </p> <p>Dubawi is also 14-1 (from 25-1) with Ladbrokes for next year's 2,000 Guineas, while Victor Chandler is two points shorter still. While Godolphin recorded their latest Group One victory yesterday, though, it remains to be seen whether another of their best performers, Sulamani, will make the line-up for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday week. Doubts over Sulamani's participation have been growing in recent days, and Ladbrokes have now removed him from their main ante-post book on the race, preferring instead to offer the five-year-old at 5-1 with a run. </p> <p>North Light, the Derby winner, is now their favourite for the race, at 4-1 (from 6-1), while Grey Swallow, who beat North Light when he won the Irish Derby in June, is a 5-1 chance. Neither colt has been confirmed as a definite runner in Paris either, though, and at present, this look like a market to attract only the brave. </p> <p>\"I'll decide on Tuesday week [whether Grey Swallow runs in the Arc]\", Dermot Weld, his trainer, said yesterday. \"I'll be leaving it as late as we need to. He was very quiet all week after the Champion Stakes at Leopardstown but he was a bit brighter this morning.\"</p>"
