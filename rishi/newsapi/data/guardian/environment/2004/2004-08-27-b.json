  "<p><strong> 1759: The Year Britain Became Master of the World</strong> <br>by Frank McLynn <br>422pp, Jonathan Cape, \u00a320</p> <p>Frank McLynn's splendid book tells the story of a year in which colonialism flourished, the slave trade was at its height and the future emergence of the United States was virtually guaranteed. It also makes a plausible claim for regarding that year as the genesis of modern history. Blame it all on Hiawatha. </p> <p>Hiawatha was the mythical founder of the Iroquois nation, which begat the Iroquois Confederacy, which was properly called the Hodenosaunee League. As McLynn tells us, \"sober historical opinion inclines to the view that it was the Hodenosaunee League that triggered the global conflict known as the Seven Years war\". No real blame there; the Hodenosaunee were pawns on a chessboard dominated by France and Britain, and McLynn's book describes the climactic year in which the heavy back-row pieces clashed mightily and Britain was triumphant. The French were on the retreat in India, had lost Quebec, were defeated in the West Indies and their attempted invasion of Britain was destroyed in the ghastly storm-bound battle of Quiberon bay. </p> <p>Those clashes are wonderfully described, yet this book is not just about battle, or even about military strategy, but about the political impulses that drove men to fight in the world's far corners, about the societies they sprang from and, most importantly, about the world they bequeathed to us. The most obvious geopolitical result of that year was the emergence of Britain as master of the world, but the most significant outcome was the removal of any French threat to Britain's 13 American colonies, which led inexorably to their conviction that they had no need of Britain's protection or government. Thus 1759 can be seen as the real beginning of American independence. </p> <p>Yet no British politician of 1759 foresaw 1776, and why should they have done so? The French threat to take over North America did not worry them half as much as French domination of the West Indies. William Pitt noted that the French-held island of Guadeloupe was worth more in profits than all of Canada, and the West Indies were more valuable than all North America. So, in 1759, the British took Guadeloupe and within a year exported \u00a3425,000-worth of sugar from the island while sending it 5,000 new slaves. </p> <p>There is evil and foolishness in this annus mirabilis. Slavery and cruelty are the evils, and anyone inclined to the view that native Americans are somehow a kinder, gentler breed than the rest of us is well advised to steer clear of chapter 10, which paints a horrific picture of the guerrilla war between the British, the French and their respective Indian allies. No one is worse than the others, all are foul, and the cruelty is compounded by stupidity. </p> <p>One of McLynn's persistent themes is the frequent influence of fools in the making of policy and war. General Braddock, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, the Duke of Cumberland, the Duke of Newcastle, Lord George Sackville - all are idiots given power, but none is so foolish as Bonnie Prince Charlie, whose vacillations, incomprehension and stubbornness destroyed the last hopes of a Jacobite restoration. Those hopes were real. The Duke of Choiseul's strategy to oppose Pitt's machinations was to invade Britain, a \"master-stroke that would redress the calamitous losses in India, the West Indies and Canada\". The attempt would indeed be made in 1759, but Prince Charles Edward Stuart, who might have become King Charles III that year, petulantly frustrated Choiseul's plans. </p> <p>If history, as Gibbon remarked, is a register of crimes, follies and misfortune, then all are amply displayed here. McLynn cleverly alleviates the crimes and follies by prefacing each chapter with an essay on some intellectual or literary achievement. 1759 was the year in which Candide was published, as was Tristram Shandy, and these lucid prefatory essays are alone worth the price of the book. But what surely makes 1759 an annus mirabilis for all subsequent writers and poets was that it was in the December of that year, in St James's Street, Dublin, that a brewery was founded by Arthur Guinness. Mirabile dictu. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels are published by HarperCollins.</p>",
  "<p>The Flea Palace, by Elif Shafak (Marion Boyars, \u00a39.99) </p> <p>Elif Shafak, a Turkish writer who was born in France and brought up in Spain, has written four previous novels, but here she seems determined to put all contemporary Turkey into one narrative. There are 10 flats in the Bonbon Palace, a shabby apartment block in Istanbul. Shafak runs up and down stairs from the hairdressing salon owned by twin brothers Cemal and Celal to the penthouse inhabited by the elderly Madame Auntie, via, among others, a Jew, a Russian and an obsessive-compulsive. The device is hardly original, but it doesn't matter. Shafak can switch from a picaresque tale of a father and son's broken noses to astute observations of how strangely despair and love manifest themselves without pausing. Though the Bonbon Palace, built by a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 on the site of a Muslim and Armenian cemetery, is clearly trying to be a microcosm of Turkey, it more subtly embodies the awful comedy of unremarkable lives. <strong> IM</strong> </p> <p><strong> Popco, by Scarlett Thomas (Fourth Estate, \u00a312.99)</strong> </p> <p>Wouldn't you like to work for a company like Popco? Being good at Go is a basic job requirement, and when the world's third biggest toy maker takes you off to the country to brainstorm ideas for a new product it hardly seems like work at all. But Alice, the narrator, a former crossword-compiler headhunted to develop spy games for the under-12s, is a natural outsider who allies herself with the Popco subversives. Though she captures the mindset of brand-savvy but insecure professionals, Thomas cannot decide whether she is writing a boarding-school adventure or a dystopic tale of global corporations. Thomas's writing is sharp and energetic, and she has to be congratulated for getting pirate treasure, cryptoanalysis, a cake recipe and some incisive asides to explain mathematical conundrums such as the Riemann hypothesis into one narrative. But it is a bulky read and the denouement is unexpectedly clumsy. <strong> IM</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Used Women's Book Club, by Paul Bryers (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>Ever wondered who to call to clear up the mess when your best friend has been butchered in the kitchen? Apparently, the police are interested only in looking at the blood and guts, not mopping it up, but they know people like Muriel Hoffman, a special kind of cleaning lady who hero-turned-sleuth Larry finds can be claimed against insurance. Unfortunately, the intriguing Muriel is a walk-on, rejected by Larry for an academic who made her reputation by writing about how fairytale princesses are subjugated by handsome princes. Knowing that best friend Meg has been humiliated by the habitually adulterous Rob makes Jo an obvious suspect. But Meg and the rest of the book club have motive and opportunity for murder. Bryers packs Jack the Ripper, Virginia Woolf and the odd Dickensian flourish into a Thameside murder mystery that eddies around clever literary references rather than being swept along by them. <strong> IM</strong> </p> <p><strong> Travelling With Djinns, by Jamal Mahjoub (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>Yasin promises his little boy \"a real all-time, once in a lifetime, never to be repeated, fully guaranteed adventure\". His wife has just announced the end of their marriage, so he and young Leo hit the road for a last holiday before custody kicks in. Yasin - half-Sudanese, half-English, \"a stranger wherever I go\" - is also out to locate himself in history as he drives through Europe. This is a thorny business, for guidebook anecdotes as far back as Hildegard of Bingen contain implications for a family transfixed between Europe and the Islamic world. Yasin is made unwelcome at Parisian mosque and snotty restaurant alike. His sister has changed from an Olivia Newton John wannabe to \"Malcolm X in drag\"; his brother has simplydisappeared from sight. Mahjoub's rallying call for mongrel humanity moves, like the protagonist's family, \"on an elliptical wobble\" that is wholly beguiling. Yasin and his creator make good on the guarantee. <strong> DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> Tokyo Doesn't Love Us Any More, by Ray Loriga, translated by John King (Canongate, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Loriga's nameless hero is a salesman peddling a memory-erasing drug. In his suitcase, he carries enough product \"to make the Pope forget where he works\". Getting by on his own supply, he skims the world from Bangkok to Berlin, dragging his altered consciousness between hotel rooms while people celebrating Hitler's birthday send old Luftwaffe hymns drifting through the walls. He staggers through euphoria, blackout and despairing minibar fucks, making hazy sense of the cities he sees. Europe is so heavy with history that you can see the allure of erasure, but eventually the salesman scrabbles to claw back his past. Loriga's method is cinematic ellipsis - he co-wrote Pedro Almod\u00f3var's Live Flesh , and the film-maker calls him \"a fascinating cross between Marguerite Duras and Jim Thompson\". Tokyo finds him caught in a dark place between pulp and parable: \"simply close your eyes and wait for better times.\" <strong> DJ</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Samurai, by Shusaku Endo, translated by Van C Gessel (Peter Owen, \u00a310.95)</strong> </p> <p>Nobel-prizewinner Endo's generation was the first to visit Europe after the second world war, and he refracts that experience through his 1980 masterpiece. In 1613, a samurai is plucked from rural obscurity to accompany a Franciscan missionary on a dubious diplomatic mission into the Spanish empire. The samurai, his world once bounded by marshland, sees unimagined wonders - the ocean, Mexico's parched plains and towering Popocatepetl, Spain's olive groves and Vatican splendour. Even so, his internal calendar registers his village's ceremonies, a clock of red bean dumplings and rice cakes at new year. The ambitious missionary, descendent of the conquistadors, is guided by the great god Expediency, and the disposable envoys are stitched up in all directions. The samurai \"considered perseverance to be his only redeeming personal trait\", but sees the walls of his world crumble as Endo brings him to a heartbreaking homecoming. DJ</p>",
  "<p>Capital of the Mind, by James Buchan (John Murray, \u00a39.99) </p> <p> How did filthy, wind-buffeted Edinburgh become the nerve centre of the Enlightenment? As Buchan writes, \"a city that had for centuries been a byword for poverty, religious bigotry, violence and squalor laid the mental foundations for the modern world\" - a thesis that he goes on to demonstrate in an entertaining intellectual history that stretches from the Highland Rebellion of 1745 to Burns's departure in 1788. Pungently evoking the Old Town and the planning of the New, masterfully condensing the lives and works of such titans as David Hume and Adam Smith, coolly anatomising the bogus Gaelic epics of Ossian and the newfangled cult of sentiment, and watching half-amused, half-outraged, as Boswell and Johnson career through his pages, Buchan brilliantly tells a complex story, adorned by his own apothegmatic insights: for example, that 18th-century scientists had more ideas than facts about the past, whereas we have more facts than ideas.<strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Mop Men, by Alan Emmins (Corvo, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> There's nothing quite so yuck-making in Buchan's Edinburgh as the descriptions here of work undertaken by \"California's Crime Scene Cleaners\". The author shadows Neal Smither, owner of a company that specialises in mopping up after messy deaths. Shotgun suicide, decomposed old person, bloody murder - Neal's your guy. He takes pride in his work, for good business reasons: \"If two months down the line somebody finds a speck of blood under the handrail or some dried brain inside the lampshade, or a skull fragment in the pot pourris, then you ain't getting recommended when her friend Doris's daughter slits her wrists on the living room floor, you know what I'm saying?\" There is a ghoulish fascination to all the scenes of maggots and soaked mattresses, and some educational value to the story of one murder in particular. Emmins starts to worry about violence in films, but Neal's way ahead of him: he got the idea for his company after watching Pulp Fiction. <strong> SP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> By Permission of Heaven: The Story of the Great Fire of London, by Adrian Tinniswood (Pimlico, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Spotting the number of the beast in the year 1666, astrologers and almanac-makers predicted something bad would happen, though none of them actually guessed a fire would break out in a baker's house in Pudding Lane. After a sluggish start, Tinniswood's narrative picks up pace as the fire takes hold. He reminds us the conflagration could have been prevented, had not London's mayor, Sir Thomas Bludworth, arriving at Pudding Lane, growled \"A woman could piss it out\", and gone back to bed. Although a mentally ill Frenchman was hanged for starting the fire (he almost certainly didn't), Londoners preferred to blame any foreigner they happened to meet. One poor woman had her breasts cut off by an angry mob that somehow mistook the chickens she was carrying for fireballs. That's the kind of hateful, violent, hysterical, paranoid London Tinniswood writes about, and he does so with great flair.<strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, by Simon Winchester (Penguin, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> \"It began with a sudden trembling,\" writes Winchester of the destruction of the Indonesian island of Krakatoa in 1883 - though not all that sudden, as we are almost halfway through his book. Krakatoa actually begins with a history of pepper, then moves on to Portuguese, Dutch and English traders, thence to maps and Ptolemy, Marco Polo and Martin Behaim's globe of 1492... What some would regard as entertaining digressions others might call padding, but this suspicion is routed by the quality of Winchester's prose. The only way to read this book is to relax and enjoy the ride. Winchester gives Krakatoa added significance by showing how news of the volcanic eruption spread almost instantaneously through advancements in communications technology (telegraphy and emerging mass media). This leads him to suggest that \"it was that day in August 1883 that the modern phenomenon known as the global village was born\". IP</p>",
  "Peace needs to be secured in Northern Ireland to help stop the advancement of global terrorism, Hillary Clinton said last night. <p>The US Senator for New York told those involved in an attempt to restore the Stormont power sharing executive that their success was vital to hold off the threat. </p> <p>\"What's at stake here in Northern Ireland goes far beyond the potential for lasting peace, justice and the opportunity of economic growth,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It is a signal event in the unfolding challenge we confront around this world today.\" </p> <p>Ms Clinton was delivering the Tip O'Neill peace lecture at the University of Ulster after accompanying her husband, the former American president Bill Clinton, in talks with the main parties and the Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, in Belfast. </p> <p>She told an audience in Derry - which included Sinn F\u00e9in leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness - that nihilistic forces were intent on destroying the modern way of life. But their plans could be dealt a setback if the latest attempts to restore devolution after all party talks in Kent next month were successful. </p> <p>\"The need for peace in Northern Ireland goes well beyond political stability,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It now speaks to regional Europe and even global stability. The motive behind the push for peace now goes not only to the security in one's neighbourhood, but also to Europe's security and to global security as well.\" </p> <p>The Stormont administration has been suspended for nearly two years after an alleged IRA intelligence gathering plot. But Mr Clinton, trying to use his influence as a pivotal figure in the peace process, rejected claims that the Good Friday agreement was beyond saving. He stressed the groups could find a way forward together. </p> <p>One of the major issues preventing a breakthrough in talks is the unionists' demand for complete IRA disarmament before they will agree to return to power-sharing with Sinn F\u00e9in.</p>",
  "<b> Adrian Hamilton</b> <br> Independent, August 26 <p>\"Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, as Washington this week quietly buried the road map to peace ... The US acceptance of additional settlement building [in the West Bank] is so absolute a slap in the face of its road-map partners, so exclusively attuned to [George Bush's] domestic political needs, that its partners have responded with open-mouthed silence.

  "Modern technology and the age-old appeal of slightly soggy but warm crumbs have come together in Britain's first league table for biscuit-dunkers. <p>Using retort stands, stopwatches and formulae with names such as optimum dunking threshold, a team of food scientists have crowned the humble ginger nut as the runaway best option for cognoscenti. A hundred volunteers joined the process at laboratories in London, to allow for individual human variation in the process. </p> <p>Technical data on the strength of each type of biscuit's structure and taste was seen as insufficient by organisers of the project, which gave the silver medal to chocolate Hobnobs and the bronze to digestives. </p> <p>\"As well as relatively straightforward physical tests,\" said William Sitwell of Waitrose Food International, which organised the scheme, \"we needed to establish the mean duration of the individual dunk episode of the average Briton.\" This was then combined with the time it took for each brand wholly to dissolve in tea, to calculate the perfect amount of time for the dunking operation. </p> <p>The experiments were triggered by growing awareness of global interest in biscuit-dunking, which has a rich literature - including fierce debates - on the internet. The practice has been known since Roman times, when the word biscuit was coined from the Latin for twice baked. \"Most of us need guidance these days, when so many different types of biscuit are available,\" said Mr Sitwell. </p> <p>\"Custard creams, for example, are an absolute disaster unless you want a teacup full of sludge and slurry. And don't waste your time on garibaldis. The results in polite society are disastrous.\" </p> <p>The research builds on a pioneering study of the physics of biscuit-dunking carried out at Bristol University in 1998. A team headed by Dr Len Fisher used equations, a belt-sander and x-rays to suggest a series of formulae and tips, including the essential advice to flip a biscuit after dunking to allow the dry part to support the wet. </p> <p>The Bristol team of guinea pigs also went the extra mile, spending some of the tests with a breathing tube up one nostril to establish which dunking medium - tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk or lemonade - had the best effect on biscuits' flavour. </p> <p>The Waitrose project was startled by the durability of some biscuits, particularly the Giant Finger which showed a rusk-like ability to stand up to immersion in hot liquid for more than an hour. </p> <p>Rich tea biscuits, by contrast, dissolved so rapidly that the survey report concluded they were only \"perfect for those without teeth\". </p> <p>Dr Fisher's team opted for the ginger nut as top dunker - although they suggested three seconds' immersion against the London survey's 2.92. Not having chocolate Hobnobs at the time, they chose digestives as runners up. </p> <p> <b>Dunkers...</b><br><br><b>Ginger nut</b><br>The classic dunker, with the ginger becoming more gingery while the biscuit holds its crunch. Dunk for 2.92 secs </p> <p><b>Chocolate Hobnob</b><br>Might be a bit messy, but dunking brings this biscuit to life and the melting milk chocolate is a real bonus. 2.85 secs </p> <p><b>Digestive</b><br>Quick immersion yields rich caramel flavours, while dense texture remains nice although the bite is softened. 3.42 secs </p> <p><b>...and duffers</b><br><br><b>Garibaldi</b><br>A noble biscuit with a decent crunch and mild, sweet taste.

  "The world is heading for wildly uneven population swings in the next 45 years, with many rich countries \"downsizing\" while almost all developing nations will grow at breakneck speed, according to a comprehensive report by leading US demographers released last week. They predict that at least an extra 1,000 million people will be living in the poorest African countries by 2050. There will be 120 million more Americans, and India will leapfrog China to become the world's most populous country. One in six people in western Europe will be over the age of 65 by 2050. But the populations of some countries will shrink. Based on a number of factors, including analysis of birth and death rates, Bulgaria is expected to lose almost 40% of its population. Britain is expected to grow faster than any other big European country. Within 20 years the authors expect it to have 4 million more people, at which point its growth is expected to tail off, adding only a further 1.5 million in the next 25 years to eventually reach 65 million. By then it will have overtaken France as Europe's second or third largest country, depending whether Russia is considered to be in Europe or partly in Asia. The changes, considered inevitable given present trends, will transform geopolitics and fundamentally affect the world's economies, people's lifestyles and global resources, suggest demographers with the Washington-based Population Reference Bureau. Countries such as Nigeria and Japan, which today have similar sized populations of about 130 million people, could be unrecognisable by 2050, say the authors. By then, Nigeria is expected to have more than doubled its numbers to exceed 300 million. But Japan, which has only 14% of its current population under 15, may have shrunk to roughly 100 million. Among the big industrialised nations, only the US will experience what the authors call \"significant\" growth. It is expected to have reached a population of 420 million by 2050, an increase of 43%. But Europe is expected to have 60 million fewer people than today, and some countries could lose more than a third of their populations. Eastern Europe is leading the world's downshifters. Bulgaria is expected to return to pre-1914 population levels, losing 38% of its people, while Romania could have 27% fewer and Russia 25 million (17%) fewer people. Germany and Italy are expected to shrink by about 10%. The projections are based on detailed analysis of infant mortality rates, age structure, population growth, life expectancy, incomes and fertility rates. They also take into account the numbers of women using contraception and Aids/HIV rates, but do not allow for environmental factors. Climate change and land degrad-ation are expected to encourage further widespread movements of people and increase pressure for migration away from rural areas towards cities and richer countries. The population changes are causing growing alarm among experts, who believe sustained growth in developing countries can be managed only with economic help from rich countries. \"World population is going to grow massively in some of the most vulnerable countries in the world. We have to ask how rich countries are going to help,\" said Kirstyen Sherk, of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The former World Bank economist Herman Daly believes globalisation and the uncontrolled migration of cheap labour could put potentially catastrophic pressures on local communities and national economies. \"The sheer number of people on Earth is now much larger than ever before. Some experts question whether Earth can even carry today's population at a 'moderately comfortable' standard for the long term, let alone 3 billion more,\" he says. Overall, says the report, world population is growing by about 70 million people a year, and is likely to reach 9.3 billion by the mid-century, from 6.3 billion today.",

But many conservationists argue that the high costs of such experiments would be better spent on protecting animals in their native habitats. </p> <p>India's scientific community seems undeterred. The loss of the Asiatic lions, a symbol of India, would be a national tragedy. Dr Singh said he had to \"save them from extinction\". </p> <p>First rescued by a prince at the turn of the 20th century, the lions live in the Gir sanctuary in Gujarat. Dr Singh said that, in attempting to in crease their numbers, he had overturned conventional thinking with a series of breakthroughs. The big cats were once thought to be beyond saving as they were descended from a few dozen individuals, and hence vulnerable to disease. </p> <p>\"Some western scientists had predicted that Asiatic lions will become extinct in a few years because of their genetic homogeneity. But this is not correct,\" Dr Singh said. </p> <p>Perhaps more daunting is the prospect of repopulating the Indian plains with Asiatic cheetahs. Described as \"critically endangered\", just a few hundred are left in Iran. </p> <p>Although the project has been mired in red tape for nearly a year, those working on the cheetah project are predicting it will take off. \"There have been some minor delays, but we are confident that the government of Iran will lend us some cheetahs,\" said Vazir Chand Aurora of India's Central Zoo Authority. </p> <p>The use of cutting-edge biotechnology is beginning to yield results throughout the world. US scientists produced the first cloned wild carnivore, an African wildcat, last August. </p> <p>All these efforts used the technique pioneered by the team behind Dolly. But Dr Singh will not be allowed to use another cheetah as a mother, as the Iranians are unwilling to allow their declining breeding population to be taken abroad. Instead a female leopard, plentiful in India and a close relation, will be used. There are also hopes that Indian scientists will eventually be able to derive a nucleus, and its DNA, from the apparently dead skin cells of a cheetah.</p>",

That's five fences down, by my count. And that could be costly when it comes to the medals.</p> <p><strong>1501</strong> Here comes Kate Allenby in the riding in the pentathlon. She knocks over the second fence. And the third.</p> <p><strong>1459</strong> \"While I agree with Tim Nelson's email I would also suggest that greece IS becoming a major competitor in world sport and certainly has hammered many European countries who are larger and wealthier (though perhaps I am biased in my views),\" writes Elena Papazoglou. </p> <p><strong>1455</strong> \"I am so bored,\" admits David Holme, \"that I have worked out the medal tallies and the EU wins hands down over the Commonwealth even if the US is included. EU - 67 golds, CW - 34 golds, and US - 28 Golds. The EU is even further ahead in terms of minor medals too.\"</p> <p><strong>1452</strong> \"Forgive me if I'm digressing slightly,\" apologises Simon Graham, \"but in the midst of all the drug-taking shenanigans has anyone else noticed the fact that no one else has got anywhere near Michael Johnson's absurdly fast 200m world record of 19.32!\" I think Johnson has noticed it, Simon. On the radio before last night's final, he scoffed at the interviewer's question about anyone getting near his time. </p> <p> <strong>1446</strong> The show jumping is under way in the women's modern pentathlon. I'll bring you news of Kate Allenby and Georgina Harland as soon as I have it.</p> <p><strong>1443</strong> \"Surely we should applaud the Greek booing,\" says Tim Nelson. \"The stadiums have been empty and the events largely dull. I rush to the screen every time I hear of some scandal or, even better, judges altering the scores because the crowd won't stop booing. What does it matter if it was bad sportsmanship or not? (Cue angry e-mails). As for partisanship, it has a long history of tradition in the Olympics. Well, at least for the last two. After the behaviour of the American and Australian crowds in recent years, watching the Greeks go mad every time they look like winning something is both exhilirating and hilarious. And at least they aren't convinced they're still a major competitor in world sport.\"</p> <p><strong>1440</strong> \"It's a good job Amir Khan is fighting Serik Yeleuov tonight rather than Kindelan then,\" writes William Cook in response to Joe Cosgrove (1426). His fight, incidentally, is scheduled for some time between 1830 and 1900.</p> <p> <strong>1437</strong> \"I agree with Mike Johnson's sentiments,\" says Warren Brown, \"but I can see all sorts of problems. First, you tend to be allowed only three entrants per event - so just because all the former Soviet states have more than the USA, that might not be the case if they had reduced entrants. We could re-instate the British Empire but we still fall well short even after taking credit for all the Aussie Gold. The real question is what Canada is on these days - nothing, that's why they're crap and that's the answer. Stop the yanks and their drugs and we're all in with a chance of beating them.\"</p> <p><strong>1435</strong> \"Forget reforming the USSR, or having an EU Olympic team,\" writes John Jackson. \"If we have a Commonwealth team, especially if we invite the US to \"return to the fold\" (am sure they would jump at the chance), we could hammer the rest of the world hands down. Admittedly there would be no UK competitors making the team, but think of all the lottery funding that would save.\" </p> <p><strong>1426</strong> \"I don't want to rain on everyone's parade,\" writes Joe Cosgrove, clearly about to rain as everyone's parade, \"as Amir Khan looks a great prospect but all this national fervour being whipped up about the 17-yea-old from Bolton is ludicrous. Kindelan a mature 33 from Cuba is unbeaten in 5 years and has beaten Khan before and is highly likely to do so again.\" So there you have it: Khan for the bronze.</p> <p> <strong>1422</strong> \"If (and I know this is unlikely, but bear with me), the USSR suddenly decide to reform,\" writes Mike Johnson, \"purely for Olympic purposes, they should shoot to the top of the overall medal listings thereby pushing the USA back into second place. Worth suggesting to them, do you think?\" Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>1419</strong> Some wise words from Chryssi Tzanetou, another Greek. \"The reaction of the Greek crowd in the 200m last night should be treated as neither backing up the Kenteris case, nor ignoring the manner in which himself as well as the IOC and the Greek Olympic Committee handled the whole issue. It should however, put all those involved in determining the fortunes of global athletics in deep thoughts, since it gives a clear and straightforward message of doubt and disbelief about the way the use of drugs is dealt with by IOC. It is common knowledge (and hopefully not only to the Greek crowd in the stadium last night) that taking drugs to improve performance is the norm these days, but only a few athletes seem to pay for it while others don't! IOC needs to prove that they are really serious about tackling this issue holistically and not selectively. The danger is evident that in few years the Olympic Games will have nothing to do with fair competition, but rather be a spectacular commercial festivity exclusive to a number of 'professionals'. And who could blame the Greek crowd for having objections about that?\" </p> <p> <strong>1417</strong> USA have beaten Russia 66-62 in the semi-final of the women's basketball. </p> <p><strong>1416</strong> \"There's nothing happening at the Olympics is there?\" notes the eagle-eyed Warren Brown. \"Why not follow Glentoran instead? I have for over 30 years and while older people have fantastic tales of near victories over Benfica in the late 1960s I've witnessed nothing of note outside of occasional Irish League triumphs. Last night they took on Finland's finest in the UEFA Cup second round - a good show but they lost again. Perhaps they could represent GB&amp;NI at the next Olympics?\"</p> <p><strong>1414</strong> Croatia are through to the final of the men's handball after an 18-16 win over Hungary.</p> <p><strong>1412</strong> Lawrence here. Ho hum.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> Well, that's me done then, and not one significant result posted - surely an Olympic record in itself. Lawrence Booth is back and he's waiting for your emails.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> Continuing unashamedly with non-results based Olympic tidbits that are as unsatisfying as they are indigestible, comes the fact that one of the smallest ever Olympians started competing today in the diving. 14-year-old Malaysian schoolboy, Bryan Nickson, all four foot, six inches of him, is in action in the 10-metre platform preliminaries. Needless to say, he weighs less than five stone so just about anyone could tuck him under their arm and walk off with him. </p> <p>I tell a lie. We have some Amir Khan-less boxing semi-final results in. Here they are:<br> Flyweight (51kg) <br> Yuriorkis Gamboa (Cuba) beat Rustamhodza Rahimov (Germany) points 20-11 <br> Jerome Thomas (France) beat Fuad Aslanov (Azerbaijan) points 23-18 <br> Featherweight (57kg) <br> Song Guk-Kim (North Korea) beat Vitali Tajbert (Germany) points 29-24 <br> Alexei Tichtchenko (Russia) beat Jo Seok-hwan (South Korea) points 45-25 <br> Light-welterweight (64kg) <br> Yudel Johnson (Cuba) beat Boris Georgiev (Bulgaria) points 13-9 <br> Manus Boonjumnong (Thailand) beat Ionut Gheorghe (Romania) points 30-9 <br> Middleweight (75kg) <br> Gennadiy Golovkin (Kazakhstan) beat Andre Dirrell (U.S.) points 23-18 <br> Gaydarbek Gaydarbekov (Russia) beat Suriya Prasathinphimai (Thailand) points 24-18</p> <p>Meanwhile, James Farlow asks: \"Is Colin Jackson Marco from BB5 in disguise?\" </p> <p> <strong>1.50pm</strong> Kostas Pateras is back to enlighten us on the grass roots feeling over the two disgraced Greek sprinters: \"As a matter of fact there is no media support campaign for Kederis not even in the tabloids. It is too embarassing. The few people who are getting on TV to apologise for them are getting a very rough ride. The problem is Kederis (he has the status in Greece of Becks) has been built up as a really big celebrity, and some people just cannot face the truth of it. There is a general feeling of victimisation as well. These are the factors which i think provoked that rather unacceptable display on thursday. Of course absurd celebrity cults are not the preserve of the Greece (and neither is the phenomenon of drug cheats), witness the column inches devoted to Paula's decision over the 10,000.\" </p> <p>Sean Dickinson has some helpful advice to dispense on an earlier problem: \"Ed Macs refusal of some charity shop grease single bargain buying-type conumdrum can easily be solved by listening carfully to the vinyl and finding out whether it is the original grease singles collection, or the modern special-edition c.august 26th 2004. If Ed was to put the vinyl to his ear (as you would a sea-shell at the beach) and hear a faint booing, he should snap it up instantly.\" </p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> For the absolute life of me, I cannot find any results that don't include some initial round of Greco Roman wrestling, so I've going to fill this page with the following tosh until I do: Hot on the heels of the US Olympic edict to their athletes to show magnanimity and humility, comes javelin thrower Breaux Greer's stated desire to not just win gold but spear the Greek populace. \"If I won a gold medal and I didn't throw over 90m, I wouldn't be happy,\" he said. \"I want to do better for the event. I want to throw 200m here. I want to hit someone in the crowd.\" My thanks also to Louise Wright for sending me a picture link to the aforementioned housing estate in Stafford. All that's missing is the Gary Docherty cul-de-sac ...</p> <p><strong>1.35pm</strong> An official-looking copy of the medal table has just landed on my desk, and it has Great Britain comfortably poised at No.12, but why are we below South Korea? We have an equal amount of golds, they admittedly have two extra silver medals, but we are four bronze medals to the good, thus giving us a two-medal overall lead. If we are going to celebrate not winning then surely our four bronze trump their two silver. Anyone have the IOC's number? Meanwhile, Ed Mac is looking for a musical blessing. Can you give it to him? \"I just bought two Adam and the Ants singles for 25p (Stand and Deliver and Ant Rap) but declined what looked like all the singles from the Grease movie, similarly priced. Good or bad? \"</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Philippe Baudillon, France's head of the bid for the 2012 games in Paris, believes the reason they missed out on the 1992 Games was because they are perceived as arrogant (if you listen closely you can hear Brian Clough nodding). He said: Every nation in the world has a reputation. In France that is positive because of our culture but it can also be negative because the people can be seen as arrogant. I accept this kind of criticism and it's something I have to take into account.\"<br> Meanwhile, Jonathon Daniels has alerted us to a bizarre and completely unexplained link between a housing estate in Stafford and the BBC commentary team. Says Jonathon: \"My sister lives in Sue Barker Close, just off Steve Redgrave Drive, and near Linford Christie Avenue and Jonathan Edwards Drive. The builders were obviously lacking a bit of imagination as the estate also includes an Andy Cole Drive. Strange but true.\"</p> <p> <strong>1.10pm</strong> In the absence of any meaningful Olympic news happening at the minute, here's Tom Hopkins taking Kostas Pateras to task: \"I was implying no such thing about the Greek nation. All I was suggesting was that either 1. The UK media are giving an unbalanced view of events (not unlikely); or 2. Sections of the Greek media are doing likewise (as would, undoubtedly, The Sun et al in similar circumstances). I was not trying to suggest that any inaccurate media reporting would reflect on the Greek people as a whole any more than I would like to think that The Sun and the Daily Mail represent me. \"</p> <p> <strong>1258</strong> Kate Allenby is now second in the modern pentathlon with the riding and running to come. Georgina Harland has moved up to 19th. And now I'm off for lunch. Please send your emails to Rob Murray at <a href=\"-=\" mailto:bobby_murray@hotmail.com\">bobby_murray@hotmail.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>1253</strong> Good news from the swimming in the women's modern pentathlon, where Georgina Harland has finished second and Kate Allenby fifth. As soon as I know how this effects their overall standings, I shall let you know.</p> <p><strong>1247</strong> Here's Martin Reynolds. \"I believe there was an international restriction placed on the percentage of effort available after Keegan, as England manager, claimed our brave footballers would give 1000% in the second half of a particular match (I think we lost). This sudden escalation of effort caused a panic and raised parallels with the Superpower arms race. What would be the equivalent percentage of America's star wars programme. For this reason the limit was set at 110%. Athletes claiming 200% or 300% effort are clearly opening themselves up for investigation by the IOC.\"</p> <p><strong>1245</strong> Alexei Tichtchenko of Russia is through to the final of the 54-57kg boxing, after a comprehensive 45-25 win over Seok Hwan Jo of South Korea. </p> <p>\"I was in the stadium last night,\" writes Elwyn Evans, \"and like many in the crowd, thought the booing pretty silly. In fact, after a point, half the noise was coming from other Greeks suggesting that the boo-ers might like to shut up. But anyway it hardly ranks very highly in the scale of crowd misbehaviour, does it? If only English football fans always limited themselves to a spot of booing and chanting.\" I think that, between us, we're slowly arriving at the truth.</p> <p><strong>1240</strong> At last - a Greek perspective. Here's Kostas Pateras. \"I suppose Tom Hopkins thinks that Greece is a very primitive and backwards place,\" he writes. \"I can tell you that Kenteris and Thanou have been getting slaughtered in the media the last three weeks and that the behaviour of sections of the crowd last night did not go down very well here. I suspect the fact that not many of the UK journalists who are sent out to the games can speak Greek and are not really able to report accurately what the word is on Greek street. Kenteris is a fool. And he is going to get crucified.\" Interesting.</p> <p><strong>1234</strong> \"If what Flotsky says is true,\" writes Jennie Evans, \"then obviously the Greek sprinters do have something to hide. Even if there was suspicion cast over their coach, if they were innocent why would they miss taking a drugs test and risk exclusion from the games. The Greek crowd were completely out of order to do what they did last night, it was absolutely disgusting to hear them.\"</p> <p> <strong>1228</strong> Song Guk Kim of North Korea is through to the final of the men's 54-57kg boxing, after a 29-24 win over Vitali Tajbert of Germany.</p> <p>\"Snit is a perfectly normal word,\" seethes Louise Wright. \"It's in the dictionary as \"a state of agitated irritation\". My main problem with medal was that it seemed to be a lazy version of \"to get a medal\", but now I see it's older than that and am \"over it\" in your perilous modern usage. I'm perfectly happy with the evolutionary nature of language, but I do object to using it lazily when there's so many good words already. Oh, and I'm not I'm not southern. I'm from Derby. That's in the Midlands.\" So there.</p> <p><strong>1218</strong> More on the Greek booing debate. \"Right,\" says Flotsky, \"as far as I understand it, after Gatlin won the 100m, his coach admitted that he was the person who had anonymously sent a syringe to authorities in the States, which set off the whole chain of events that (handily for Gatlin) eliminated Dwayne Chambers and Tim Montgomery from competition. It also let to suspicion being pointed at the Greek coach and his runners. The Greek crowd appeared at first to be solely booing Gatlin and his team-mate Crawford, who is coached by the same chap.\"</p> <p> <strong>1213</strong> \"I was listening to FiveLive last night,\" admits Ben Hendy, \"and their take on the whole booing of the Americans by the Greeks was that they feel they (the Greeks) have been picked on by the IOC for the positive drug tests that have occurred and they reckon all the American athletes are taking drugs and there is a big cover up of it (because of all the information that's come out about past competitors). But surely no one could accuse the Yanks of corruption?\"</p> <p><strong>1210</strong> The final of the men's flyweight boxing division will be fought between Yuriorkis Gamboa of Cuba and Jerome Thomas of France. Congrats all round.</p> <p>\"What on earth is a snit?\" wonders Steven Graves. \"It sounds like some creature out of Lewis Carroll...is this a southern thing? And how can anyone using such a word get precious about the English Language? Language changes. Nouns can be verbs. After all, the moaners all emailed in to complain didn't they? Get over it.\"</p> <p><strong>1207</strong> Obscure results of the Olympics dept: Kazakhstan beating Egypt 15-7. In the men's water polo. To secure 11th spot.</p> <p>\"Using 'to medal' is pretty annoying,\" writes Ben Wild. \"Equally annoying is the endless atheletes who declare they're going to give 110, 200 or even once I heard 300 percent in effort. Everyone involved in the Olympics seems very keen on encouraging sport in the younger generation, how about encouraging a basic understanding of maths.\" Fair point, Ben. Fair point.</p> <p><strong>1204</strong> After the shooting and the fencing in the women's modern pentathlon, Kate Allenby lies sixth, 100 points behind the leader, Hungary's Zsuzsanna Voros. Georgina Harland is 26th out of 32, but with her best events to come. Which is a good job, quite frankly.</p> <p><strong>1201</strong> This Greek crowd story is really brewing up nicely. \"I've heard that Greek papers were filled two weeks ago with stories of IOC testers going to Crete to test US atheletes and then the US Olympic Team claiming they were terrorists and getting them jailed for the night to avoid US athletes being tested,\" claims Ben Wallis. \"There are all sorts of unsubstantiated rumours flying around Athens and the Greek media (but not appearing in UK media) which might explain why the Greeks feel aggrieved by the US atheletes and that Kederis has been singled out.\"</p> <p><strong>1159</strong> \"I thought the Greek crowd actually showing signs of life for anyone other than a Greek athlete was great last night in the 200m,\" says Paul Lofthouse. \"Steve Cram, in fine BBC tradition, (see also Barry Davies), was incredibly pompous in his condemnation of the crowd reaction.\" The thing is, Paul, the crowd <em>were</em> showing signs of life for a Greek athlete. It's just that he wasn't there.</p> <p><strong>1156</strong> Here's Tom Hopkins on last night's booing by Greek fans prior to men's 200m final. \"It was definitely my take that it was to do with the Greek Motorcyclist, who seems to have taken it as some kind of vindication (the man actually has no shame). The thing is, has the Greeks heard the same story we have they would surely be embarrassed by him, not supporting him. Has the Greek press been telling a completely different version of events?\" Very odd, wasn't it? </p> <p><strong>1154</strong> In the other classification matches in the men's hockey, India have beaten South Korea 5-2 to finish seventh, and Pakistan have defeated New Zealand 4-2 to claim fifth.</p> <p><strong>1150</strong> Just to clear up the 1145 entry - GB beat South Africa 4-3 on penalties after it finished 1-1 after extra time. Still, a win's a win's a win, isn't it?</p> <p>This is getting very erudite. \"Indeed the full version of the OED has two versions of the verb 'to medal',\" writes Charlie Wilson. \"A transitive version dating as far back as Byron in 1822 (usually referring to war medals), and the intransitive version employed by Colin and the Yanks, and recorded as far back as the Washington post in 1979. Just in case you were wondering...\"</p> <p><strong>1145</strong> Great Britain have beaten South Africa 5-4 in the men's hockey 9th/10th-place playoff. Well done them.</p> <p>\"If the modern pentathlon is based on military skills how did fencing become included?\" asks Andy Watson. \"Surely duelling disappeared after the Napoleonic war? Much more modern would be to use those rocket propelled grenade things everybody likes firing at the Americans.\" </p> <p><strong>1138</strong> \"Has no one had anything to say on the behaviour of the crowd last night at the start of the 200m final?\" writes Joy Clancy. \"BBC commentators really got on their high horse (which reminds me you've said nothing on the show jumping), adopted the high moral ground etc. etc. Does anyone know why the crowd seemed to pick out one of the Americans? (One would like to think it was also some anti-Iraq war protest but then why pick on one?).\" I thought they were just annoyed that Mr Kederis wasn't there, Joy. But I could be wrong.</p> <p><strong>1133</strong> Louise Wright sends in an email with the subject title \"Medal as a verb\". \"I was in a right snit about that one too,\" she rages, \"but then I looked it up on Dictionary.com yesterday and discovered Thackeray used so it's got a fair lineage. I like to think of Colin Jackson whipping through a chapter of Vanity Fair before he drops off at night.\" A nice image.</p> <p><strong>1130</strong> The swimming in the women's modern pentathlon begins at 1225, incidentally.</p> <p>\"The commentators seem particularly keen on the phrase 'it's a big ask',\" writes Paul Horgan. \"That makes no sense, unless they're referring to an ample posterior...\"</p> <p><strong>1125</strong> The better news is that both women did much better in the fencing - Allenby came third, and Harland is moving up the placings too, with her best events - riding, swimming and running - still to come. </p> <p><strong>1122</strong> Bad news after the shooting in the women's modern pentathlon, where we have two serious medal hopes. The world champion Georgina Harland has had a shocker, and finds herself 30th out of 32 competitors. Kate Allenby, who won a bronze in Sydney, is not much better in 19th.</p> <p>\"I'm wondering if anyone caught Clare Balding laughing into her nosebag last night at the standard of showjumping in the men's modern pentathlon,\" asks Luke Satchell. \"I was trying so hard to side with the 'athletes', but they were so bad it was impossible to do so. Surely a pre-requisite for entering the competition is actually being able to get the horse off the ground?\"</p> <p><strong>1118</strong> Tom Hopkins has a more romantic explanation for the genesis of the modern pentathlon. \"The events are supposed to follow a story, something along the lines of: a soldier fights in a war (shooting), has to ride his horse to find his sweetheart (show jumping), swim over a river (swimming), and fight a duel (fencing) before he gives up and runs away (running).\" Not sure about that last bit, mind. </p> <p><strong>1115</strong> Morning. Lawrence here. Which means the 24-hour clock. Far more succinct and far less fiddly for the old fingers.</p> <p>Here's Tim Reston. \"In answer to the query from Louisa Noble, whereas the \"old\" pentathlon, heptathlon, decathlon all are traditional athletics (running throwing, jumping - i.e. similar to the ancient Olympics), the modern pentathlon is supposed to test competitors in the \"modern\" skills of shooting, fencing, riding, running and swimming, i.e. to simulate the sort of skills an Army officer or superspy might have. James Bond would do pretty well, except that his strongest talents might necessiate the addition of a few more events, and be considered a bad influence on the young.\"</p> <p> <strong>11.05am</strong> It's goodbye from me, and hello from the very dapper Lawrence Booth.</p> <p><strong>10.55am</strong> Gunn-Rita Dahle takes gold and nearly loses his sunglasses at about the same time.

Maybe he should ask for a refund from his chemist.\"</p> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> \"Just wondering if anyone else has been keeping track of the standings in the silliest name event,\" wonders Deb Cresswell. \"Until last night the strongest contender looked to be the Thai women's weightlifting champ, Thongsuk, but there is growing support for Australian diver Loudy Tourky, whose name caused a simultaneous cry of \"GOBBLE GOBBLE\" from all present when it appeared on my TV screen last night.\"</p> <p><strong>10.20am</strong> Russian 400m runner Anton Galkin is the latest Olympian to be thrown out of the Athens Games for a positive drugs test.

Right you are: well, it's on, but it's hard to discern what's happening really. The course looks like an absolute brute, mind.</p> <p><strong>More bits culled clinically from the wires</strong> Neither Georgina Harland nor Kate Allenby made a particularly auspicious start to their Olympic medal quest in the modern pentathlon today. Harland, the world number one, finished the shooting stage 30th of 32 competitors with just 808 points, compared to the 1,204 of leader Lean Dong of China. Allenby fared rather better but came 19th with 964 overall points which translates into a one minute handicap on the final discipline, the cross-country run. </p> <p><strong>9.15am: Gerry Keaty from Prague's thwarted dream</strong> \"I was taking no notice yesterday evening of the ladies short board diving competition on the TV in the background, when I was suddenly forced to investigate. I heard the Eurosport commentator say about one of the divers that she was \"going topless\". I thought this might have been a new ruse to influence the judges. As you can imagine I scrambled to the TV to get a look, but unfortunately he probably realized what he had said and qualified it with a \"in the diving sense of course\", whatever that means. Shucks.\" What <em>does</em> that mean? Anyone? Anyone?</p> <p><strong>Update lifted hastily from the wires</strong> Great Britain's hopes of adding to their haul of 25 medals in the kayaking this morning were dashed in two finals at the Schinias Rowing Centre. Paul Darby-Dowman and Ian Wynne failed to medal in the final of the K2 1000m. The pair struggled to keep pace with the leaders and finished well down the field in seventh. </p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Morning. I'm wet through. That's not supposed to be a lurid, Wild Things-style blast of early morning tittilation, just cold - and I mean cold - hard facts that put the shambles that will doubtless follow in its proper context.</p>",
  "<p>Every year, we wait with baited breath as the computers whir through the final calculations of the Guardian's annual boardroom pay survey. Will this be the year when directors' pay rises bear some resemblance to the sort of numbers normal mortals have to rub along on? </p> <p>Frankly, the bit about the waiting and the baited breath is a trifle exaggerated, because the whole notion of directors' pay rises bearing any relationship to the usual wage determinants - like available supplies of skill and talent, the rate of inflation, profits or just plain merit - is quaint, if not laughable. </p> <p>In Directorland, the good times have been rolling for years, despite successive governments calling for boardroom pay restraint and recent (hollow) threats of legislation if directors didn't do the honourable thing. Increasingly scientific methods are used to measure management performance on which bonuses are based and shareholders regularly say \"enough is enough\" when underperformers are over-rewarded. But it is never enough. So it was no surprise that our new survey showed boardroom pay up an average of 12.8% last year. OK, it is down on last year's 23% rise, but it is still nearly three times the 4.7% increase in UK average earnings (which dwindled to a much more recognisable 3.6% when the impact of the annual bonuses paid to a relative handful of City workers is excluded). </p> <p>The latest idea from shareholders is to force companies to detail ratios of directors' pay to their workforce average. The gap between chief executives and their underlings is widening rapidly - though is still tiny compared to US levels - and a bit of moral pressure, the National Association of Pension Funds seems to believe, would work wonders. Nice try guys. But don't hold your breath. The average chief executive now earns a whopping \u00a31.7m a year, even though his basic salary is a relatively paltry \u00a3581,000. (And we use the term \"his\" on purpose. It is a fact that should embarrass everyone that there are only 17 female executive directors among the country's top 100 companies). </p> <p>Of course, not every huge pay deal proves a problem. Take Tesco. The board is paid five times more than average and every one of the eight (male) full-time directors would need a wheelbarrow to carry home their wad. But who is complaining? Not the shoppers, benefiting from lower prices, not the workers in newly created jobs and not the shareholders. The ones that stick in the craw are the toe-curling payoffs that some still manage to secure. </p> <p>Step forward Michael Green, the former chairman of Carlton, shown the door by disgruntled shareholders after years of poor performance. Mr Green had no contract yet waltzed away from Carlton with \u00a39.4m and another vast sum heading his way next year. </p> <p>So why do boardroom salaries keep moving north? The remuneration committees point the finger at recruitment and retainment problems. It's not just that these jobs are tough. Who wants jumped up shareholders and pesky journalists poring over your performance? Why not opt for the quiet life in private equity and be paid far more? The remuneration consultants, meanwhile, blame executive salary demands on the trend for greater disclosure. With full details of every pay deal now revealed in annual reports and news- papers, they say, directors are bound to compare their own pay with their peers and rivals. They then demand parity - or more - and average pay is remorselessly cranked up. </p> <p>Where will it end? Not here and not yet. A tightknit industry has grown up advising companies on executive pay and it would be a brave consultant who suggested pay cuts to a non-exec on a remuneration committee if they also advise the company where that director works full time.</p>",
  "History is beginning to repeat itself, this time over Iran. Just two years after the notorious Downing Street dossier on Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction and the first efforts to get United Nations approval for war, Washington is trying to create similar pressures for action against Iran. <p>The ingredients are well-known: sexed-up intelligence material which puts the target country in the worst possible light; moves to get the UN to declare it in \"non- compliance\", thereby claiming justification for going in unilaterally even if the UN gives no support for invasion; and at the back of the whole brouhaha, a clique of American neoconservatives whose real agenda is regime change. </p> <p>The immediate focus for action against Iran is the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has produced five reports on Iran in the last 14 months. Part of the UN, with an international board which acts like a mini security council, the IAEA's reports have raised questions about Iran's professedly civilian nuclear programme and its desire to create its own fuel cycle which could eventually be used to produce bombs.</p> <p>To satisfy its critics, Iran agreed last year to allow so-called intrusive inspections. As a confidence-building measure, it also stopped enriching uranium. In a few days' time the IAEA will issue a new report, and it is its wording which is causing the latest flurry. John Bolton, the Bush administration's point-man, has been rushing round Europe claiming the evidence of sinister Iranian behaviour is clear, even though the IAEA has consistently made no such judgment. It has called for more transparency, but prefers to keep probing and, like Hans Blix and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq in 2003, insists it needs more time.</p> <p>Iran, meanwhile, says the IAEA should accept that nothing wrong has been found, close the dossier and let Iran receive the civilian nuclear technology - with the safeguards that go with it - which countries like Germany and France have promised. </p> <p>Bolton is not, at this stage, claiming to have intelligence which the IAEA's inspectors don't. After the fiasco of the US's pre-war material on Iraq, he has not started to trumpet US sources. But he is choosing to interpret the available knowledge as harshly as possible. He is also close to the Washington hardliners in the Project for the New American Century, who created the doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against unfriendly states and who favour regime change to deal with Islamist fundamentalism.</p> <p>Norman Podhoretz, the arch-conservative editor of Commentary magazine, one of their house journals, said last week: \"I am not advocating the invasion of Iran at this moment, although I wouldn't be heartbroken if it happened.\" </p> <p>There are differences from the anti-Iraq campaign two years ago. This time the US is taking the lead in going to the UN. Bolton wants the IAEA board to say Iran has violated its commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and take the matter to the security council for a decision on sanctions or other stern action. France and Germany are resisting a move to the UN.</p> <p>Second, even the US (Podhoretz excepted) is not talking about a full-scale US invasion with ground troops. It has too many soldiers tied up in Iraq and Afghanistan to spare many for a third campaign. The talk is of using US special forces or airstrikes to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, or giving a green light to Israel to do it. Slightly less impatiently, there are hints that the CIA will step up its campaign to overthrow the regime in Tehran by encouraging anti-government TV and radio broadcasts from abroad and infiltrating opposition movements. </p> <p>The biggest difference, though, is in Britain's stance. Unlike with the Bush campaign against Saddam Hussein, Britain is siding this time with France and Germany. It is part of a \"troika\" which promotes constructive engagement rather than confrontation with Iran. Their dialogue ran into a sticky phase this summer with allegations of bad faith on both sides, but the three European states are willing to keep it going. </p> <p>They have powerful arguments. The disaster of the Iraq war and the failure to bring peace, stability or order make them want no repetition in Iraq's more populous and larger neighbour. Even \"limited\" air-strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities would unify the country and harden hostility to the west throughout the Middle East, especially if Washington subcontracted the attacks to the Israeli air force. </p> <p>Most Iraqi resistance to the Americans is based on nationalist resentment, and Iranians are no different. People of all political persuasions in Tehran support their country's right to have nuclear power, and probably even bombs. Threatening them with force is not the most intelligent way to persuade them otherwise. </p> <p>The defeat of Iran's reformist MPs in this spring's unfair elections, as well as the certainty that President Mohammad Khatami will be replaced by a less liberal figure next year, have not ended the chance of dialogue with Tehran. European diplomats detect the emergence of a group of \"pragmatic conservatives\" in the Iranian leadership who could be easier to deal with than the beleaguered liberals of the past seven years. Many are non-clerical veterans of the Iran-Iraq war who are influenced by nationalism and economic imperatives more than the revolutionary Islamic ideology of the Khomeini generation. They want better relations with the west. </p> <p>Britain's difference with Washington on Iran is remarkable. It matters more than the better-publicised splits on the Kyoto environmental protocol or the international criminal court. But does Britain's alignment with France and Germany on Iran mean that Tony Blair has really parted with George Bush on a key geo-political and military issue? Or has he not yet spotted that what he regards as the lily-livered flunkies in the Foreign Office are up to their \"realist\" tricks again? They also opposed the invasion of Iraq until Ol' Laser-Eyes in Downing Street focused on the file. </p> <p>We will know the answer after the US election. Even if Kerry wins, European diplomats expect no major change in Washington's policy to wards Iran. Like Cuba, Iran produces special symptoms of irrationality (because of the unrevenged wound to US pride the mullahs caused when they held diplomats hostage in the embassy a quarter of a century ago). </p> <p>So how will Blair cuddle up to the new president? What easier way than to break with France and Germany and show Kerry that, whether there's a Democrat or a Republican in the White House, Britain's prime minister is still best friends when it comes to being tough with Islamist bullies and taking the brave and moral route to war? Inshallah, no. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Safety watchdogs have launched a yearlong study into whether pollution in the Thames is putting public health at risk. </p> <p>The investigation follows mounting concern over discharges into the river of untreated sewage and is another blow to the public perception that the Thames is cleaner than it has been for centuries. </p> <p>Agencies have warned people not to row, canoe or sail after heavy rainfall downstream of Teddington Lock, where the tidal river starts, because of health hazards. One said the risks had not fallen since 600,000 tonnes of sewage poured into the river three weeks ago. </p> <p>They are seeking to prove for the first time whether polluted water is causing intestinal disease in water sports enthusiasts, a sign authorities are worried the Thames may return to a pestilential state. </p> <p>Although the study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) focuses on one group of people, it could undermine the Thames' reputation as one of the world's cleanest city rivers, a boast often used by tourist chiefs trying to entice visitors to London. </p> <p>News of the research may also cause problems for London's 2012 Olympic bid although the results will not be known until after the International Olympic Committee has chosen the winning city next July. </p> <p>None of the water sport centres - rowing at Eton, canoeing at Broxbourne on the river Lea, and triathlon swimming on the Serpentine in Hyde Park - are on the tidal Thames but the river may still be an important attraction in marketing the city. </p> <p>The study was commissioned before this month's sewage discharges killed thousands of fish but this week canoeists blamed that discharge for making them sick. </p> <p>The Environment Agency said yesterday rain throughout the month \"means that the risk to public health has probably not diminished at any time over the last few weeks\". </p> <p>The study will centre on river users around Putney, south-west London, near the finish of the annual Oxford v Cambridge boat race and downstream of the antiquated sewage works at Mogden, but its results will help determine advice for the 94-mile tidal Thames. Scientists will monitor the health of 1,000 river-users, who will keep diaries to record their illnesses. </p> <p>Regular checks on bacterial and viral contamination of the water will also be conducted so that dates can be cross-checked for links between recorded illnesses and high contamination levels. </p> <p>Scientists will not reveal full details of medical tests in advance so people taking part cannot influence results. </p> <p>The research by the HPA was commissioned by the London Port Health Authority, successor to the body once responsible for protecting the capital against infectious diseases such as cholera. </p> <p>The HPA said: \"Hundreds of rowers, kayakers and sailors regularly use the Thames and the risks to their health are poorly defined _ </p> <p>\"Gastrointestinal illness has previously been linked to exposure to contaminated seawater on bathing beaches and smaller studies have confirmed illness in whitewater kayakers ... the storm of August 3 may have been an unusual event, but the problem of contamination _ is a longstanding one.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile people should not go on the water after heavy rainfall but wait for the river to clear. </p> <p>The Port Health Authority said Putney was \"one of the riskiest places on the Thames for health problems\" because of the large amount of bacteria in the water and also because it was \"the most popular area for river users\". </p> <p>The Environment Agency said surveys of Thames water quality between 1999 and 2002 had shown that levels of micro-organisms with the potential to cause disease in humans increased around the times there were storm discharges into the river. </p> <p>These remained high for two days following each \"sewage overflow event\" of which there are up to 60 a year. </p> <p>These overflows often resulted in other waste matter such as condoms, sanitary towels and hypodermic needles being deposited in the river, on the foreshore and on footpaths. </p> <p>David Stubbs, the member of the 2012 bid team responsible for environmental issues, said attention was being paid to water quality at its water sport venues. </p> <p>Of the Thames, he said: \"I know there have been some overflow incidents because of the freak storms we had in August but over a longer perspective the Thames has cleaned up enormously and on a general level it is one of the world's cleanest rivers.\" Recent incidents were \"blips\" in long-term improvement. </p> <p>The government has delayed a plan for a \u00a32bn, 22-mile tunnel under the riverbed to dispose of storm water and sewage even though London's present arrangements breach a European directive on waste water. It says further work is needed. </p> <p><strong> Dirty old Thames, page 11 theguardian.com/water</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>June was cold, the wettest in Britain for 100 years. At one point, it rained non-stop for more than 58 hours in London, the longest downpour ever recorded in the city. The result was severe flooding throughout the south-east. July, too, was miserable and August was \"exceedingly cool, wet and windy\" with strong gales, storm damage and a rotten harvest. Scotland shivered. </p> <p>This was not the lost summer of 2004, but of 1903, well before global warming was ever considered as even a minor player in the world's climates. </p> <p>There will always be freak weather and temperature and rainfall extremes, but what is extraordinary is that very wet summers such as those of 1903 or 2004, as well as intense heatwaves, storms and droughts, are coming thicker and faster as the world heats up. Ten of the past 14 years have been the hottest recorded, and this is linked by scientists to a rapid rise in levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere - which according to ice core samples tested in the Antarctic, are the highest in 440,000 years and still rising. </p> <p>Almost all climate scientists, atmospheric chemists and oceanographers say the greenhouse effect has arrived and that we should expect more droughts, hurricanes, flash floods, forest fires and giant storms. The kind of extreme weather that happened once in 100 years, they say, could soon take place every 20 years. </p> <p>There's plenty of evidence that 2004 is falling into this pattern. There have been major fires in southern France, California, Greece, Ireland, Nicaragua and Alaska, where five million acres have been burning. Drought is affecting large areas of east and southern Africa and there have been intense heatwaves in Spain, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. </p> <p>But 2004 may be remembered for its floods. Just eight months into the year, Bangladesh, and to a lesser extent India and Nepal, have had some of the severest seen in decades, with tens of millions made homeless. Less noticed have been major floods in Hungary, Vietnam, Kenya, Romania, Lagos, Nicaragua, Iran, Siberia, Bosnia and Papua New Guinea. Meanwhile, 17,000 people needed help after huge snowstorms in the Andes and Korea, and there were heavy falls in unlikely countries such as southern Greece, Jordan and Syria. </p> <p>Last week the European environment agency produced evidence that Europe was warming faster than expected and that the number of natural disasters had more than doubled in the past decade. Last year's pan-European drought cost 20,000 lives and billions of euros and the later floods affected at least 600,000. The agency, which said that most European glaciers were in fast retreat, warned people to expect more flash floods, mudslides, storms and droughts. </p> <p>Happily, fewer people have died as a result of extreme weather this year. Last year was one of the worst on record, with the Red Cross estimating that up to 700 \"natural disasters\" claimed 50,000 lives, almost five times as many as in in 2002. Heatwaves in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan took temperatures up to 50C (122F). In China floods along the Huai and Yangtze rivers swept through 650,000 homes. </p> <p>The economic cost of extreme weather is soaring. This month's Hurricane Charley caused \u00a310bn of damage in the US. Typhoons in China and Taiwan have also caused enormous losses. Last year's losses worldwide topped \u00a334bn. </p> <p>But the most unusual weather event in 2004 could have been the 90mph hurricane that hit Catarina in southern Brazil in March. Hurricanes have never been recorded in the southern Atlantic, because the atmosphere does not provide enough \"spin\" near the surface to get them started and winds higher in the atmosphere tend to shear off any that threaten to form. </p> <p>Whether it was a true freak of nature or what we can expect with global warming is hotly debated. Climate change scientists in Britain have predicted for some time that such unprecedented events in the south Atlantic would one day be a possibility. But few believed it would happen so soon.</p>",
  "<p>In a dramatic reversal of its previous position, the White House this week conceded that emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases were the only likely explanation for global warming. </p> <p>Citing the \"best possible scientific information,\" an administration official, James Mahoney, delivered a report to Congress that essentially reversed the previous White House position set out by George Bush, who had refused to link carbon dioxide emissions to climate change. </p> <p>Two years ago, when his administration last published a document claiming that global warming over the last few decades had been prompted by human behaviour, Mr Bush dismissed it as something \"put out by the bureaucracy\". </p> <p>One of Mr Bush's first acts on the international scene as president was to refuse to ratify the Kyoto treaty, which aimed to cut emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012 - prompting outrage throughout the world. </p> <p>\"We must argue with the Americans and get them to agree we have to have a global solution, and America is a very important part of that solution,\" the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said at the time. </p> <p>But Mr Bush also alienated himself from members of his own cabinet as he overrode the recommendations of his newly-appointed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman. This was widely seen as a payback to the energy lobby which had donated a huge amount to his campaign. </p> <p>At the time Mr Bush cast doubts on the science, claimed restrictions would hamper economic growth, and said the treaty was \"unfair to the United States and to other industrialised nations\" because it exempted developing countries. </p> <p>However, it will be far more difficult for him to distance himself from the current report, because it has been signed by the secretaries of energy and commerce in his administration. </p> <p>Coming just days before the Republican convention opens in New York, it is thought to be another attempt by the administration to show moderate leanings. </p> <p>The report, which also quotes studies that indicate that carbon dioxide stimulates the growth of invasive weeds more than it does crops, is part of a regular series submitted to Congress to monitor global trends. </p> <p>Mr Bush's former allies in the energy industry criticised the findings. Myron Ebell, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the New York Times it was \"another indication that the administration continues to be incoherent in its global warming policies\". </p> <p>Environmentalists say the report's conclusions simply highlight the distance between what the Bush administration has done and what good science suggests should be done. </p> <p>\"For four years the Bush administration has brought the international global warming negotiations to a virtual standstill by claiming that uncertainties in climate science do not justify the cost of tackling it,\" said Rob Gueterbock of Greenpeace. \"Now they have finally accepted that CO2 is causing global warming, they have absolutely no excuse for not rejoining the Kyoto process. Every day they continue to stall will now be held to be criminally negligent by future generations.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>A New York judge has rejected a request from New York's largest anti-war group to hold a rally in Central Park the day before the Republican convention. </p> <p>State supreme court justice Jacqueline Silbermann ruled that United for Peace and Justice was \"guilty of inexcusable and inequitable delay\" in bringing the case to court. </p> <p>The group said it still planned to march past Madison Square Garden, the convention site. </p> <p>The city's parks department had argued that a protest in the park would ruin the lawn.</p>",
  "Pocono Summit, PA. It was here, in the parking lot of Cramer's building supply, only 15 miles from a Nascar racetrack, in a pivotal battleground state, on the back of a battered work van, that we saw the first one. \"Somewhere in Texas,\" the bumper sticker said, \"a village is missing its idiot.\" The next Bush-is-thick sticker showed up at Home Depot on the back of an equally battered pick-up driven by a tough-looking kid dressed for construction work. It said: <p>BUSH </p> <p>LIKE A ROCK </p> <p>ONLY DUMBER </p> <p>These are signs of the fierce conviction of some voters - and the secret fear of a quieter and perhaps larger group - that George Bush is not smart enough to continue as president. Indeed, if an unscientific survey of bumper stickers, graffiti and letters to the editor in this conservative mountain region of eastern Pennsylvania is an indicator, doubts are spreading, and probably not in a way helpful to the Republicans. </p> <p>Yet the subject is seldom taken head on by the mainstream newspapers and network news. The discourse about presidential intelligence appears mainly on the internet, in the partisan press, among television comics and at the level of backyard jokes and arguments. The White House has shown a devious brilliance in keeping a contrived debate on John Kerry's \"fitness\" to be commander-in-chief in the headlines, at the expense of any prolonged journalistic examination of the far more important question of Bush's mental capacity. That uncomfortable question will surely be glossed over when the Republican national convention starts next week in New York. </p> <p>After four decades of newspapering, including coverage of the \"dumb\" Ronald Reagan and the \"smart\" Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980, I am not unsympathetic to the problems of reporters and editors trying to inform the public on this touchiest of competency issues. As Richard Reeves commented memorably in a 1976 article comparing Gerald Ford to Bozo the Clown, the rules of conventional journalism make it almost impossible to report that a presidential candidate \"had nothing to say and said it badly to a stunned crowd\". Big news organisations are captives of our own rules of fairness. Voters are doubly disadvantaged - by a paucity of information in the campaign coverage and by the elusive nature of the evidence about the kinds of intelligence that matter in our leaders. </p> <p>For example, my generation of White House correspondents was accused of covering up Ronald Reagan's supposed stupidity and his reliance on fictional \"facts\" derived from Errol Flynn movies and the John Birch Society, the rightwing organisation founded in 1958 to combat the perceived infiltration of communism. In 1981, Clark Clifford, the Democratic \"wise man\", entertained Georgetown dinner parties with the killer line that Reagan was \"an amiable dunce\". Twenty years later, we know that Clifford got indicted for bank fraud and the dunce ended the cold war and the entire Soviet era. </p> <p>This lesson of history raises questions of seeming importance. What is presidential intelligence, and how much does it really matter? Most astute Americans can recite the lists of ostentatiously brilliant presidents who faltered (Wilson, Hoover, etc) and apparent plodders who triumphed (Truman). When I was covering the Reagan White House in 1981, all his top aides were wholesaling Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous comment about FDR possessing \"a second-rate intellect and a first-rate temperament\". In the end, Reagan confounded scholars, journalists and voters alike. Even so devoted a cheerleader as Peggy Noonan, a Reagan speechwriter, sees him as flawed by \"detachment\". His diligent and tormented biographer, Edmund Morris, does not even list \"intelligence\" as an index entry under Reagan, Ronald Wilson. Such entries are also missing from such solid journalistic biographies as those by Lou Cannon and Lawrence Barrett. Morris, in his obituary essay about Reagan in the New Yorker, referred in one paragraph to his instinctive \"intelligence\" and in the next to his \"ignorance\". </p> <p>To be fair, innate intelligence has to do with capability and ignorance to do with variables such as educational opportunity and personal diligence. But the conundrum remains. Is intellect important in presidents? If Americans can't solve the question definitively in the matter of John Kerry and George Bush, we damn sure ought to make an educated guess. </p> <p>One highly imperfect but salient way to do so is at the level of campaign tactics. Does anyone in America doubt that Kerry has a higher IQ than Bush? I'm sure their SATs and college transcripts would put Kerry far ahead. Yet at this point in the campaign, Bush deserves an A or a high B instead of a gentleman's C when it comes to neutralising Kerry's knowledge advantage. That much was apparent even before the campaign got mired in the current argument over the nasty television commercials questioning Kerry's record of heroism as a Swift Boat commander in Vietnam. </p> <p>Over the course of the summer Bush, or more likely his political adviser, Karl Rove, dictated the subject-matter of the campaign by successfully triggering Kerry's taste for complicated ideas and explanations. Kerry is telling voters that we live in a complex world. Americans know that, but as an electorate, they are not drawn to complexity. Kerry's explanations about his conflicting votes on the Iraq war and how he would have conducted it are wondrous as rhetorical architecture. They are also signs that Bush has trapped him into having the wrong conversation with the voters. Last week, Bush trumped Kerry's intricate explanation of his conflicting votes on funding the Iraq war by going on Larry King Live and saying over and over that a president must be resolute, and that he will be. Meanwhile, his wife Laura seemed to make a sale with the outrageous claim that her husband's restrictions on stem cells are not really hurting medical research. </p> <p>Whatever his IQ, George Bush as a candidate is a one-trick pony. The story of the campaign so far is that Kerry is letting him get by with his single trick - endless repetitions of \"I make a decision; I stick to it; that's what presidents do.\" As astute an observer as David Broder has written that Bush's twin millstones - the war and a job-losing economy - may bring about his defeat. I'm not so sure, mainly because Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, keep talking about what the White House wants them to talk about instead of messages that the bumper-sticker guys at Cramer's and Home Depot need to repeat to their buddies. They have yet to force Bush outside his one-trick comfort zone. </p> <p>That pattern continued this week as Rove demonstrated his mastery of the \"Willie Horton strategy\" perfected by his mentor, the late Lee Atwater. In 1988, Atwater famously destroyed the campaign of Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, with a series of \"independent\" ads claiming that Dukakis had improperly paroled a convicted rapist and murderer named Willie Horton. This year, wealthy Bush supporters close to Rove have funded a front organisation called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to carry out an \"independent\" attack on Kerry's well-documented record as a decorated battle commander in Vietnam. </p> <p>Kerry's demand that Bush condemn the commercial and Bush's hair-splitting refusal to do so dominated the news all week. Bush refers to Kerry's Vietnam service as \"noble\" while carefully avoiding a specific, direct denunciation of the veterans' grossly misleading ad. There's a good reason for this. The president does not want to identify with these worms who sponsored the ads, but he wants their commercials to keep eating away at the apple of Kerry's much stronger reputation as a warrior. </p> <p>Happily for the White House, this contrived debate over Kerry's war record diverts voters from a truly important national-security question related to the intellectual capability of the incumbent. Was George W dumb enough to be talked into adopting a flawed strategy for a phoney war by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney? The facts and authorship of these blunders are beyond dispute. Cheney and neo-conservative theorists wanted to make war on Iraq, not al-Qaida. Rumsfeld wanted to do it with a much smaller force than the military needed. What we don't know is why Bush went along. </p> <p>Bush's former press secretary, Karen Hughes, in her awkwardly named book Ten Minutes from Normal, assures us that what \"Bush does best of all\" is \"ask questions that bore to the heart of the matter\". She says that during the 2000 campaign, she and a \"brilliant\" issues staff \"never once succeeded\" in anticipating all of Bush's penetrating questions. \"He has a laserlike ability,\" Hughes writes, \"to reduce an issue to its core.\" </p> <p>In regard to Iraq and the war on terror, there's little evidence of such Bush interventions in the public record or the report of the 9/11 Commission. We have been told instead that the then director of central intelligence, George Tenet, misled Bush by assuring him that Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction was \"a slam dunk\". </p> <p>The millions of us who did not witness this and other potentially laserlike interactions must rely on speculation as to how Bush's mind works. The most informative writing I've seen on that score was an essay published over a year ago in the Atlantic Monthly by Richard Brookhiser, the historian and conservative columnist sympathetic to Bush. \"Bush has intelligence, energy and humility,\" he writes, \"but does he have imagination?\" </p> <p>Brookhiser goes on to worry that Bush's limited information \"habitat\" could cut him off from the ideas necessary to feed presidential creativity in activities like running a major war. (\"Habitat\" is a wonderfully chosen word in that it invokes the territoriality of White House advisers in general. Can we imagine Rumsfeld, the alpha-male advocate of hi-tech warfare, inviting the commander of an armoured division into the cabinet room to tell the president why it's stupid not to take more tanks to Iraq?) </p> <p>Brookhiser goes on to speak of Bush's reliance on \"instinct\" and the fact that Bush's religious \"faith means that he does not tolerate, or even recognise, ambiguity\". The comments sent my memory reeling back to the Reagan campaigns and what the cartoonist Garry Trudeau called \"the search for Reagan's brain\". Trudeau's meaning, of course, was that Reagan didn't have one, but these days the phrase is to me more evocative of the journalistic gropings of the White House press corps to explain what, if anything, was going on inside that big, smiling, glossy-haired head. In a filing cabinet I had not opened in over 20 years, I found my own attempt - a 6,000-word draft of \"reflections\" on \"Reagan's mind\". I had never turned the piece in to my editors at the New York Times because I felt I had not solved the mystery as to the quality of Reagan's intellect. </p> <p>I was not the first, nor will I be the last writer to break his pick on that stone. But in reviewing what I wrote in 1982 after two years of close observation of Reagan on the campaign trail and in the White House, I saw a couple of points that seemed worth revisiting as Reagan's self-appointed heir seeks a second term. I characterised Reagan as a \"political primitive\" who valued \"beliefs over knowledge\" based on verifiable facts. The White House spin was that this was a positive in that it represented \"rawbone American thinking\". I also noted that Reagan had a \"high tolerance for ambiguity\" as to the outcome of policies that proceeded from such rough-hewn thought. </p> <p>That strikes me as a different - less troubling - trait than what Brookhiser sees as Bush's refusal to recognise the mere existence of ambiguity. In general, I've come to feel that what we have in George Bush is a shadowy version of Reagan's strengths and an exaggerated version of his intellectual weaknesses. </p> <p>In 1982, at the height of my journalistic desire to explain Reagan's brain, I went to see David Gergen, then a presidential assistant in charge of communications. His was not an easy job, since it included such tasks as explaining Reagan's decision to throw thousands of the most disabled Americans off social security assistance. We're not talking \"welfare queens\" here. We're talking blind people in wheelchairs. </p> <p>I told Gergen I wanted to write a piece for the sophisticated reader about exactly how Reagan's mind worked. With a twinkle in his eye, Gergen said, \"It will be a long, long time before we can have that conversation.\" </p> <p>It hardly seems worth the trouble now. Reagan is in the pantheon, and the American nation and its allies and adversaries escaped mutual assured destruction. Now the US is at war in Iraq in a conflict that could yet metastasise into regional strife or global terrorism. We'll never know how much Reagan thought and how much he gambled in regard to security and economics. My guess is the answer would be pretty scary. So for the 150,000 US troops in Iraq, for the 99% of taxpayers who will not get a five-figure windfall, for the millions of urbanites unsettled by talk of suitcase nukes, it's still worth asking how Bush's mind really works.</p>",
  "<p>Vodafone's hopes of acquiring SFR, the mobile phone subsidiary of Vivendi Universal, suffered a blow yesterday after the music and television group reached a 3.8bn euro (\u00a32.5bn) tax deal with the French government. </p> <p>Vivendi has been granted a new tax status which will allow it to reduce its future tax bills by offsetting profits, including those from SFR, against some 11bn euros of historic operating losses. The move increases SFR's value to Vivendi. </p> <p>Though the new system operates on a group-wide basis, analysts at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein note that while SFR will still pay 100% of its tax obligations, \"Vivendi will be able to recoup 56% at the parent company level\". </p> <p>Under the previous regime Vivendi could only use the tax offset on profits from companies where it had a stake of at least 95%. Under the new consolidated global profits tax system the threshold is reduced to 50%. </p> <p>Vivendi has a 56% stake in SFR, while Vodafone has the remaining 44% and is known to be interested in buying Vivendi's stake if it comes up for sale. </p> <p>\"The ruling makes SFR more valuable to Vivendi and increases the price of Vivendi's stake for Vodafone. This makes a deal less likely and more difficult for Vodafone to justify as additional synergies are limited.\" </p> <p>Industry sources noted that the impact might only be short term, with other factors influencing the way Vivendi treated its tax windfall - using profits on other businesses against the tax losses, for example. </p> <p>Yesterday Vivendi reiterated that its SFR stake was not for sale. A Vodafone spokesman said: \"When and if Vivendi wanted to sell and we got into talks then we would have to assess the situation at that time in order to gauge the worth of the business. </p> <p>\"We would only pay what we considered to be a sensible price at that time.\" </p> <p>The new tax regime will save Vivendi 500m euros this year and some 3.8bn euros over the next seven years. </p> <p>However, Vivendi would have to apply to renew its tax status after five years. Vivendi made its initial application in December last year. </p> <p>Vivendi has also agreed with the finance ministry that it will set up two call centres in areas of high unemployment in eastern France which will employ 300 people each. The company said yesterday that it needed to increase its call centre facilities. </p> <p>It has also committed itself to spending a further 5m euros a year over the next five years to help create another 1,500 jobs, again in eastern France. </p> <p>Vivendi said the jobs initiative was \"in parallel\" with the tax deal. Such tax arrangements were \"not unusual\".</p> <p>\"Other companies have had them. It is not as if we have been shown any favouritism,\" said a spokeswoman.</p> <p>The deal comes amid reports that Nicolas Sarkozy, the French finance minister, is preparing to introduce tax breaks designed to discourage companies from outsourcing abroad and to reward them for bringing jobs back to France.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 is planning to launch a national digital radio station and is in talks with a high profile radio executive to act as a consultant on the project. </p> <p>It is expected to announce today that it has signed a development deal with radio broadcaster UBC Media that will explore establishing a talk radio station on a national digital licence. </p> <p>The companies will launch a six-week consultation process at the end of the month and discuss their plans with Ofcom, the media regulator, and independent producers who will provide much of the station's programming. </p> <p>However, sources close to Channel 4 stressed that no decision has been made regarding the radio station and it is one of many options the broadcaster is considering. </p> <p>If the station, which has the working title of Channel 4 Radio, goes ahead it will be 50/50 owned with UBC Media, the largest independent radio production company in the UK and owner of digital station Classic Gold. </p> <p>It marks a strategic shift at Channel 4 under new chairman Luke Johnson, who joined in January this year with the mandate of ensuring it remains a viable business in the era of multichannel TV. The station's potential for cross-promoting the Channel 4 brand will also appeal to Andy Duncan, the new chief executive, who oversaw the launch of the Freeview digital TV service as head of marketing at the BBC. </p> <p>The advent of Channel 4 Radio would be a significant departure for the government-owned channel, but even greater upheaval is expected over the next year as the broadcaster seeks changes to its ownership structure that will enable a merger with a rival broadcaster such as Channel Five. </p> <p>Channel 4 Radio would launch in the second quarter of next year at the earliest, broadcasting on a UBC-owned licence which is currently occupied by talk station Oneword Radio. </p> <p>The new station would have to follow the talk format stipulated in Oneword's licence, but the current remit of book readings and play performances would almost certainly change. Discussion programmes, listener phone-ins and news would form an important part of a schedule aimed at Channel 4's key audience demographic of 18- to 34-year-olds. </p> <p>The six-week consultation process will involve drafting a rough business plan for the station. The companies will hold talks with Digital One, owner of the national digital radio network on which the station will sit, and Ofcom, which must give its permission for changes to Oneword Radio's remit. </p> <p>The independent production sector is also expected to get involved in the process, through companies such as Lion TV, which is moving into radio, and Celador Productions, which produces comedy for BBC Radio 2. </p> <p>The consultation process will be overseen by Michael Hodgson, head of corporate development at Channel 4's commercial arm, 4Ventures, and Simon Cole, chief executive of UBC Media. 4Ventures is run by Rob Woodward, a former investment banker at UBS Warburg, who is determined to give the previously underperforming unit a higher profile role in Channel 4's future. </p> <p>If the station is given the green light, it will need a managing director and programming director, whose appointments will be influenced by the as yet unnamed consultant on the project, who will be announced next week. </p> <p>Channel 4 Radio is expected to have a relatively low budget for a talk station because of the planned outsourcing of programming to independent producers. </p> <p>Talk radio is traditionally costly but Oneword Radio operates on a budget of less than \u00a31m.</p>",
  "<p>While Britain's track cyclists came from nowhere to take four medals in Sydney, the Athens Olympics may well mark a sea change in their outlook and produce another great leap forward, according to the team's performance director Dave Brailsford. </p> <p>\"We've gone from just trying to get medals to being disappointed if we don't win. The performance in Sydney gave the riders and staff the self-belief. It was clear to everyone that we were going in the right direction and we've moved on from there.\" </p> <p>Brailsford and his predecessor as performance director Peter Keen believe the team have developed in strength and depth, and the results here bear them out. The four medals could easily have been six had the fates not intervened in the team sprint and keirin. In the 12 track events, top-10 placings were achieved in all but two. </p> <p>The approach taken by Brailsford and Keen before him boils down to a quest for perfection which extends to unlikely areas. For example, in Sydney the team used largely off-the-peg cycles; now, looking to save fractions of a second, they have moved to making their own bikes, wheels and components. </p> <p>The team also researched methods of keeping the riders cool in Athens' high temperatures by linking up with the Naval Research Station in Gosport, who had looked at ways of treating servicemen in the Gulf. \"They pointed us to the fact that the best way of cooling is by immersing the hands in water at 18C to 22C (65F to 72F),\" said Brailsford. </p> <p>\"The question then was how to apply the science and we ended up with something simple: the riders have to sit in a chair when they are in the track centre waiting to race, so we have chairs with two bags of water at the right temperatures, so it doesn't matter if the weather is humid. </p> <p>\"Chris Hoy was sitting in the chair before his gold medal ride in the 1km, so that's an example of pure science being applied to this environment.\" </p> <p>People management has also been given priority. \"There have been big staff changes since Sydney when there was a lot of unrest in the camp. If you want to get the best from a rider on a given day, the people around him have to know what makes him give his best and they have to be inspired. We wanted to develop the best back-up team we could. </p> <p>\"It's not about happy families, that would mean we were in a comfort zone. I like the mood being a bit grizzly because everyone is pushing hard and is on edge.\" </p> <p>Merely to employ a nutritional adviser might seem old hat, not so a forensic psychiatrist who has worked with prisoners at Rampton mental hospital. More conventionally, Chris Boardman has also been brought in as \"expert adviser\" to the squad, largely to use his experience to brief riders on what to expect as potential medal winners. </p> <p>The national lottery has pumped \u00a36.7m into cycling since Sydney. That means more than \u00a31.5m per medal here, but the medals are only part of a bigger picture, says Brailsford. </p> <p>Brailsford points out that as acting chief executive of British Cycling, the national governing body, he has a responsibility to get people on their bikes. \"What we're hoping is that Olympic success can be incorporated into helping cycling as a sport and recreation.\" </p> <p>The ongoing success of the track cyclists, for example, is bound to have been a factor in the re-creation of the Tour of Britain, which returns to the calendar next week. </p> <p>But Brailsford's wider aim is to use the Olympic medals to draw major firms into pushing recreational cycling as part of the government's agenda of cutting obesity levels. </p> <p>He and his organisation are in advanced talks with \"a major corporation\" to back a high-profile campaign based around mass cycle events - a sort of \"leisure cycling for all\" - which is aimed at getting the nation back on its bike.</p>",
  "A brief meeting in a three-star central London hotel lasting barely a quarter of an hour yesterday ended the two-year fire dispute which at its height led to nearly 20,000 soldiers being mobilised to answer emergency calls. <p>The most bitter dispute for 20 years ended with a whimper as the exhausted parties - government ministers, fire authorities and union leaders - agreed a compromise. </p> <p>Thousands of soldiers at a training area in Gloucestershire are to be stood down and Whitehall's planto requisition modern red engines will be rescinded now that the Fire Brigades union has decided to suspend a further strike ballot. </p> <p>A TUC-mediated agreement on the arcane if sticky question of duties on bank holidays released a 4.7% wage rise plus \u00a3500 in back pay for 52,000 crew members. </p> <p>Mike Fordham, the FBU's assistant general secretary, said that \"patient negotiation and goodwill on all sides\" had achieved the much delayed settlement. \"I hope that we can rebuild the trust and partnership which has been lacking recently.This has been a long and difficult dispute. Our members can now get on with what they do best.\" </p> <p>Liz Barron, chairing the Local Government Association's team, said: \"It was always our intention to make these pay rises, but only in return for a truly modernising fire service that keeps pace with today's changing demands for fire prevention work and greater community safety in an increasingly 24 hour-a-day society.\" </p> <p>The compromise means firefighters will carry out normal tasks on bank holidays, earning double time and a day off in lieu, and the fire authorities will recognise that it is not a \"normal\" working day. </p> <p>The increases, 4.2% due from July last year and 3.5% due since November last year, are the final stages of the 16% deal phased over two and a half years in return for which with crews agreed to adopt new working practices. </p> <p>The award is one of the best in the public sector, putting a qualified firefighter on \u00a325,000 a year, but is well below the 40% jump to \u00a330,000 demanded by the FBU when it unleashed a wave of stoppages in the autumn of 2002. </p> <p>Attempts to secure a settlement in November 2002 were scuppered when the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, failed to secure Downing Street approval for a draft deal. </p> <p>The government, which kept the fire authority negotiators on a tight leash, believes it has secured the green light to modernise the fire service. </p> <p>But the dispute poisoned relations between the Labour party and the unions, the FBU leaving the party and other unions blocking a long-funding proposal. The dispute developed into the most serious industrial stand-off since the Wapping, GCHQ and miners' confrontations of the Tory era. </p> <p>Mr Prescott said in a statement: \"This is clearly good news for firefighters and their families and the public. </p> <p>\"These negotiations were the responsibility of the employers and the FBU, but I have been kept in close touch with developments. </p> <p>\"At their request, I did meet both the FBU and representatives of the employers earlier this month, and I am glad that they have been able to reach agreement. We must now put this dispute behind us.\" </p> <p>The TUC general secretary Brendan Barber, who helped the parties find common ground, said: \"I am delighted that a negotiated settlement has finally been achieved to bring this long-running chapter to a close. </p> <p>\"The task now for all sides will be to put the tensions of the dispute behind them so that everyone involved can concentrate on what they do best - delivering a first class service.\"</p>",
  "<p>With regular reports of rising student debt, taking a gap year abroad could soon become a distant memory. But you don't need to teach English in Mongolia or monitor the local wildlife in Africa to add a bit of colour to your CV.</p> <p>There are now a variety of voluntary organisations providing a range of gap year projects in the UK, which will not only be easier on your wallet, but could also prove more valuable than heading abroad.</p> <p>The Community Service Volunteers (CSV), the UK's largest volunteering and training organisation, sees 129,000 people give 3.8 million hours of their time to its projects each year. The organisation prides itself on providing a gap year with a difference. \"We offer an alternative gap year in this country - you don't need to go abroad,\" says spokesman Jason Tanner.</p> <p>Volunteers, who must be over 16, spend between four and 12 months working on a CSV scheme. Living away from home, they are fully immersed in training and community action and gain - some for the first time - direct experience of the world of work.</p> <p>Each volunteer gets paid an allowance and accommodation is provided. Mr Tanner says the experience provides participants with a \"meaty challenge\". </p> <p>\"They could be working with people who've had drug dependency, homeless people, or helping people with disabilities attend university. Or it might involve living with people with a disability, socialising with them and so on.\"</p> <p>This kind of volunteering opportunity is ideal for students who want to go on to work in a caring profession. If you're interested in such a role, Independent Living Alternatives could be another organisation for you. Their aim is to place volunteer personal assistants with people with disabilities who need a bit of help to live more independent lives.</p> <p>Volunteers live-in and receive a small allowance for the four or more months of their placement. Importantly, you still get many of the benefits of a traditional gap year, like learning to live away from home and getting a new perspective on life. All this as well as getting CV points for being socially responsible.</p> <p>However, social work and personal care are not for everyone. If you want to live away from home, meet new people and develop new skills there are plenty of other ways to go about it.</p> <p>Christians, for example, might want to join the Lee Abbey community in London. Lee Abbey London runs a hostel or hall of residence for international students of all denominations. A community of young Christians work together to run the hostel, and you can spend your gap year living and working in the community. Accommodation (in swanky Kensington) is provided, as are all living expenses and a small allowance.</p> <p>If that's still sounding a bit too touchy-feely, you can volunteer to help the environment. You will learn new skills to respond to new challenges and hopefully get a warm glow from having done a good deed. You'll also meet and mix with new people and develop those all-important teamwork skills.</p> <p>The National Trust has a scheme for volunteers who can work for 21 hours a week for three or more months. Accommodation is sometimes available with your placement, but you can also volunteer if you want to live at home. This would be ideal if you want to work part-time during your gap year to offset the free labour you're giving to the National Trust.</p> <p>The National Trust is keen to emphasise that 80% of their full-time volunteers move on to paid employment or training, so it's a useful stepping stone for people taking a gap year before embarking on a related career.</p> <p>Another conservation group is BTCV. Although not that well known, BTCV is the UK's largest practical conservation charity.</p> <p>If you want to do lots of different things in your gap year, a short stint on one of BTCV's conservation holidays could be the thing. Although you do have to pay a small amount - about \u00a390 for a week - the working holidays are in beautiful parts of the country and often include specific training in conservation. They also run international placements if you want to spend a few weeks of your gap year abroad.</p> <p>Closer to home, BTCV have a huge range of other opportunities in their local centres. If you want to volunteer with them whilst staying local, their advice is to contact your nearest office and see what use they can make of your skills. If you don't want to get your hands dirty you could volunteer in the publicity office or administration department which could be useful if you want to pursue those careers.</p> <p>If you have a particular passion, there are organisations offering special interest conservation holidays. Canal and cathedral camps take groups of like-minded volunteers off for a week or two to restore parts of Britain's crumbling industrial and ecclesiastical heritage. You could be driving a dumper truck, felling trees or cooking for the rest of the volunteers.</p> <p>Again, they are not free but they are certainly not as costly as a full-blown world tour, and can be fitted in with paid work during your gap year. A week on a canal camp with the Waterway Recovery Group costs about \u00a360. </p> <p>It's true that a gap year in the UK might not be quite as glamorous as a gap year in Goa. But a really profitable gap year, where you learn new skills, meet new people and do some good deeds can happen anywhere in the world. When it comes to CV points, your gap year is worth what you make it. If you can show that you developed the skills you need for your career, it won't matter where you were when you did it. And you never know, you might just discover a hidden talent for canal restoration while driving the dumper truck!</p>"
