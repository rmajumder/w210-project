  "Train services and even whole lines will be made easier to axe under proposals in this autumn's Railway Bill which are seen as a desperate bid to plug a massive hole in the transport budget. <p>The plans are part of a promise to give local authorities power over whether to spend money on railways or other transport such as buses, trams or road improvements. At the moment the money for railways and much other local transport is allocated nationally. </p> <p>Critics fear that the bill's changes will lead to a repeat of the drastic cuts under the then British Rail chairman, Dr Richard Beeching, in the 1960s. </p> <p>'It will ring all sorts of bells about Beeching Mark 2,' said Anthony Smith, national director of the Rail Passengers Council. 'It won't be anything around London [that's cut], it won't be strategic routes. I don't think it will be the rural ones like Cornwall because of politics: I think it's outside the [urban] areas like Manchester, or Leeds, and possibly other big cities. </p> <p>'They don't have the protection of [urban] passenger transport executives, they are relatively long routes, therefore they are more expensive to run, and usually [get] very little in terms of revenue.' </p> <p>Other experts, however, predicted the government's move would fail because the marginal cost of extra services and rural lines would not generate enough savings for local politicians to brave the public backlash. </p> <p>A Department for Transport official said they would not comment on the bill before its expected publication in the Queen's Speech in November. </p> <p>However, a spokesman for the infrastructure company Network Rail said changes would have to be made so regional bodies could make decisions about how best to spend the money - a key change promised in the recent railway and transport white papers. 'The government clearly has to look at whether that process would work in [the current] environment,' he said. </p> <p>Under the Railway Bill 1993, which privatised British Rail, closures are first proposed by the network operator. The Strategic Rail Authority must then consider dozens of criteria and consult various interests, including passenger groups and the Rail Regulator, before deciding whether to recommend the move. The secretary of state gives final approval. The SRA has been trying for four years to remove one return service from Wales to London Waterloo, which was carrying an average of eight people a day and cost \u00a3500,000 a year. As well as giving local authorities new powers, the Railway Bill will also abolish the SRA. </p> <p>Experts are divided, though, over whether cutting individual services and rural lines will save significant money. Some believe the costs of running these lines are underestimated because they do not include the expense of buying special parts for often different infrastructure designs, nor the back office staff supported by the wider network. </p> <p>Others claim that, apart from the subsidy, very little money is spent on the regional infrastructure. Operators could also have to pay heavy fees to train leasing companies if they break contracts early. </p> <p>Meanwhile a handful of 'community rail partnerships' suggest that local groups can run the services for much less subsidy. </p> <p>'That would be a terrible shame if what we got out of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape the railways for 30 years is a shrinking railway when there's growing demand for travel,' said Mick Duncan, public transport campaigner for the Transport 2000 lobby group. </p> <p>Earlier this summer the Department for Transport budget deficit was understood to be over \u00a3200m, but Whitehall sources said it had been reduced and cost cuts were continuing. </p> <p>As part of the reforms unveiled this summer to give Network Rail more responsibility for improving services, the company is thought to be drawing up plans to take a more pro-active role in deciding what trains to buy. </p> <p>One person close to the discussions said the company wanted to make sure trains were compatible and would not add unnecessary costs to the infrastructure, but denied Network Rail had plans to buy the rolling stock from the leasing companies.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone fancy investing in the airline industry? Thought not. Airlines face a double whammy of ailing consumer confidence and sky-high oil prices. British Airways reports its September traffic numbers this week in an atmosphere of scarcely concealed panic among investors on both sides of the Atlantic. But is it all bad for BA? </p> <p>Although City analysts will have to rip up their forecasts if oil stays at $50 or higher in 2005, BA can console itself that its competitors are in a far worse state. Alitalia would have sunk had it not been for a rescue package put in place by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Sabena and Swissair have already failed, while Lufthansa has been forced to scale back its ambitions. </p> <p>And life has never been tougher for budget airlines: Ryanair and Easyjet are competing against 60 no-frills carriers in Europe. As supply and demand grow increasingly out of kilter - and the oil price heads north - casualties are almost certain. Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary has spoken of 'a bloodbath' in the winter, when sales traditionally fall off, and he is probably right. </p> <p>But BA is hardly on its knees: chief executive Rod Eddington deserves credit for turning round the short-haul business and bringing the company back into profitability. There is even talk in the City of a return to the dividend list after a gap of three years. </p> <p>However, despite the sale of its Qantas stake for A$1 billion, not to mention 13,000 job losses and a host of other measures, BA still needs to cut costs. According to its own projections, the company must save another \u00a3200 million by 2006. To achieve this, it must confront unions over 'costly' Spanish working practices. </p> <p>Funnily enough, a high oil price could work to Eddington's advantage. As the woes of the US industry have demonstrated, reforms are more easily pushed through when employees recognise that the sword of Damocles is hanging over their heads. At $50 a barrel, we are nearing the danger zone.</p> <p><strong> Daniels in the City lions' den</strong></p> <p> Lloyds TSB and Abbey National have more in common than meets the eye. Abbey, the crumbling mortgage bank which got its fingers burnt through its exposure to junk bonds under former chief executive Ian Harley, is being sold to Spain's Santander. </p> <p>Eric Daniels, boss of Lloyds, is in charge of a national banking franchise which, like Abbey, has seen better days. And, again like Abbey, it is trying to up its game in a market dominated by giants such as HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland in a bid to build market share after being beaten up by competitors. </p> <p>Lloyds is finding the going tough, and, like Abbey, it could also eventually be sold to a foreign predator. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America have been cited as potential buyers. </p> <p>But investors have given Daniels a year or so to improve performance before making a final judgment about whether Lloyds needs to pair up with an overseas sugar daddy (though, naturally enough, they would expect him to take an approach seriously, should one come ahead of time). </p> <p>But the comparison with Abbey can only go so far. Lloyds has never recorded the huge losses Abbey saw two years ago after its disastrous foray into wholesale banking. Neither has it been forced to part company with its chief executive and a host of other senior directors in the teeth of widespread shareholder anger. Bluntly, Abbey is in worse shape. </p> <p>But the backdrop for Lloyds is one of scepticism and angst. In the past, the bank has been slated for lack of direction, a fruitless search for overseas acquisitions, apparent listlessness prior to the arrival of Daniels and lack of commercial nous. While Lloyds dilly-dallied, Fred Goodwin of RBS and Sir John Bond of HSBC were breaking out of Britain's difficult domestic market and storming the United States. </p> <p>Recently, Lloyds has shown that it is rebuilding market share in Britain, but this has not yet translated into an increase in the value of sales; and lending margins are being crimped more than the City would like. </p> <p>Critically for Daniels, the purchase of life insurer Scottish Widows has never lived up to expectations; its performance under Dan- iels will be a litmus test of his leadership. He has time, but without significant improvements by the end of 2005, Lloyds, like Abbey, will come under intense pressure to sell to the highest bidder.</p> <p><strong> Cable &amp; hopeless retreats in Japan</strong></p> <p> More evidence of managerial incompetence and imperial overreach at Cable &amp; Wireless. In 1999, it acquired Tokyo-based operator IDC after winning Japan's only hostile takeover. Now it is considering selling it. Few companies have cracked the Japanese telecoms market (even Vodafone is struggling) and C&amp;W certainly hasn't - IDC has lost millions. </p> <p>Former C&amp;W boss Graham Wallace was the man who tried and failed to turn C&amp;W into a global, internet-based telecoms empire and must bear responsibility. His successor, Francesco Caio, is trying salvage something from the mess. But selling IDT for less than Wallace paid for it is hardly cause to celebrate. And Caio's recovery plan is no clearer.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Avril Lavigne</strong> </p> <p>Z\u00e9nith, Paris </p> <p>'This song is for all the girls,' hollers Avril Lavigne. 'Stand up for yourselves. Be strong and be able to say no to horny boys.' </p> <p>In a pop culture that is saturated with images of schoolgirl jailbait, Lavigne's blunt declaration that it is OK not to put out is admirable. With her fondness for throwing devil signs, dressing down and strapping on a guitar, she has assiduously cultivated herself as the anti-Britney and firmly planted herself in camp rock. But given the increasingly hysterical antics of Mrs Federline, she is going to have to work hard to out-punk the Louisiana pop princess. </p> <p>At the same time as the press was peppered with references to Britney's 'faux' wedding to dancer Kevin Federline, Lavigne was apparently set to get engaged to Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley; the story was quickly quashed. But given that they are both famous and probably quite lonely, perhaps Spears and Lavigne are not that different after all. </p> <p>Lavigne's persona as a kick-ass teen punk has turned her into a global phenomenon - her debut album Let Go shifted more than 14 million copies. Then again, like Spears, she has no shortage of detractors, whose beef springs from the disparity between her rock-chick persona and her beginnings as a country singer with a strict Christian upbringing in rural Napanee, Canada. </p> <p>Tellingly, her second album, Under My Skin, has moved on from the infectious snappy buzz of Let Go , acquiring a darker quality as it chews over the emotional fallout of relationships. Sonically however, to her fans' delight, it is still pretty close to her debut. </p> <p>Her monster 'Bonez' tour to promote the new release (it refers to bones, she quips, in case you're confused, 'Cos they're under my skin, that's funny right?') finds 7,000 Parisians flocking to le Z\u00e9nith, a clinical Eighties-style sports hall, on the eastern edge of the city. </p> <p>From the off, there's no messing about. The band tear into 'He Wasn't', a classic number about the misery of a wasted Saturday waiting for a loser boyfriend to call. It perfectly encapsulates her appeal to introspective and lovesick adolescents. Brandishing sickly green 'Avril' glowsticks and lighters (one wag has also brought along a skateboard), the crowd give her a raucous reception, with a volley of screams and stamping. </p> <p>Lavigne and her four-piece band of young rock dudes exude confidence and create a slick racket. A diminutive figure, she is dressed in straightahead rock'n'roll uniform of black drainpipes; a skinny-fit black T-shirt and some shiny brothel creepers. Her look is aped by the young girls in the audience and, perhaps as a reflection of France's uncoolness in the pop stakes, there are plenty of boys present too, although they've had the good sense not to go for the eyeliner. </p> <p>There's no denying that Lavigne has talent. Her strong voice soars through rousing choruses and softly-softly verses. In the name of authenticity, she strikes out a fuzz of barre chords on her guitar before swapping it for a grand piano and coming across like a low-key folkie for a few acoustic numbers. </p> <p>Predictably it is high-speed pop nuggets such as 'Sk8er Boi' that stoke the crowd into a frenzy of gentle moshing. The radio-friendly skate anthem, written by the Matrix, propelled Lavigne to global superstar status. But the production team, who also worked with the likes of Darius, were passed over for the second record. It is clear that she has a preference for performing the darker material from Under My Skin , and tracks such as 'Forgotten' and the new single 'Nobody's Home' are rendered truly convincing live. </p> <p>Lavigne is not a natural show-woman. She lacks the ferocity of proper punk nihilism and the co-ordinated stagecraft and pizzazz of true pop. Instead, she paces the stage agitatedly, occasionally punching the air in the same faint-hearted manner as Tim Henman. But it doesn't matter. She could easily stand still and twitch her little finger and Parisians would still swoon at her feet. As if to prove this point, Lavigne is barely able to conceal her boredom during a rendition of her biggest hit 'Complicated' - replacing the title word with 'constipated' in the opening line. </p> <p>Lavigne is a record executive's dream as an alternative act, cashing in on teenagers' demands for something more visceral from their pop. Her sound cleverly appropriates the more palatable elements of alternative rock and varnishes them with commercial sensibility. </p> <p>But a night in Avril's company is an enjoyable reel through catchy pop hooks that don't threaten to choke you with naffness. And you know the show won't resort to trashy sexual gimmicks. It is neatly packaged and sanitised teenage rebellion for the disaffected. If you can't get over your adult suspicion that it is all a thieving sham, then you're taking it too seriously. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Avril Lavigne's UK tour begins tonight at Manchester MEN Arena</p>",
  "<p>Sit down if you have shares in Sainsbury's. The news just got worse. Hard on the heels of Sir Peter Davis's \u00a33.8 million pay-off, regarded by many as a 'reward for failure', comes another astonishing multi-million-pound payment approved by Sainsbury's board of directors. </p> <p>This one was to a man you have never heard of because he has never worked a day for the company. Michael Dean has received \u00a33m and is in line for up to \u00a37m more. He may be Britain's luckiest small businessman for he was in the right place when Sainsbury's property development team came knocking. </p> <p>The supermarket decided it had to speculate to accumulate, and Dean's property was the gamble it took. It was prepared to bet almost \u00a310m on a run-down, four-storey corner shop with flats above in the belief that it would unlock access to central London's last superstore development. As a public planning inquiry last week showed, it may prove to have been an expensive flutter. </p> <p>For context, remember how critical property is to retailers' fortunes. Remember that many retail experts trace Tesco's dominance to its property team's canny buying in the late Eighties and early Nineties. Property is central to thriving and surviving in the business of selling beans and bank accounts. </p> <p>So why did Sainsbury's write a post-dated cheque of up to \u00a310m for a corner shop, and how did it happen that this property could turn out to be valueless? </p> <p>Number 283 Edgware Road has been problematic since Westminster City Council agreed 15 years ago in principle to the regeneration of a large site opposite Paddington Green police station. The owner, Dean, rejected repeated offers for his property from Waterfront Finance, the developers who then controlled the site, a car park since 1994. </p> <p>At some point the site, which the council wanted to see developed with homes, shops and a large supermarket, came to Sainsbury's attention. By the end of the Nineties Sainsbury's had a close relationship with Waterfront. There was talk of a joint project. Public inquiry documents show that only Dean and his demands for \u00a320m stood in the way. </p> <p>His property had become crucial because the planners wanted to use the opportunity of redevelopment to widen Edgware Road, one of the key routes into central London from the north. The issue of widening has become inextricably linked to the future of the development and has led to several planning applications being rejected. </p> <p>As Sainsbury's told the inquiry, it had been trying to buy number 283 since 1999 'to avoid the ransom position that the owner of that property was using'. Dean's price for outright sale was too high, so Sainsbury's negotiated an option on the property. The contract shows it agreed an upfront fee of \u00a32.6m in October 2002 with an option to buy for \u00a35.6m with an expiry date of 2007. For every quarter that the option is not exercised, Dean receives an interest payment pegged to HSBC base rates, which shall not be less than the equivalent of 5 per cent of the purchase price per annum. </p> <p>Interestingly, a full 10 months before the option was approved by Sainsbury's board Westminster City Council's minutes record that it did not seek a compulsory purchase order for Dean's property because officers did not think they would get one. Even at that stage, the conclusion was that number 283 was not essential to the area's redevelopment. But alarm bells failed to ring and the Sainsbury's deal was done, as it believed the site was critical to road widening, a sticking point in planning discussions. </p> <p>Then the goal posts moved. Waterfront Finance decided to sell the site in 2002. Sainsbury's bid for it, but lost out to West End Green Properties (WEPG), a company headed by a Greek Cypriot, Andreas Soteriou, who was prepared to pay the same price without conditions. </p> <p>WEGP set about tackling the blocks to development. Sainsbury's reaction, as correspondence shows, was first to try to get into bed with WEGP, then to do a deal that compensated Sainsbury's for the money it spent on the Dean property and then to offer for the whole site. Essentially, Sainsbury's wanted to use what it thought was its trump card to secure the superstore site. </p> <p>WEGP's attitude hardened, particularly as it received unsolicited calls from other food retailers and realised that it could command 'previously unseen levels' of rent and premiums for 'the last large foodstore site of its kind in central London'. </p> <p>'WEGP do not consider having to pay for Dean and not receiving a positive premium to be a market proposal,' the minutes of one meeting record. </p> <p>For as long as road widening was an essential part of planners' demands, with number 283 included, Sainsbury's had a negotiating position. Then the authorities shifted their stance. Several times. The public inquiry, from the planning authorities' viewpoint, is now more about the height of the proposed adjoining residential tower, WEGP's contribution to Westminster's social and community fund, and traffic than it is about the number 283 'bulge'. </p> <p>Any hope that Sainsbury's could appeal to WEGP to do a deal looks slim. The developer's adviser noted: 'The substantial confusion and planning problems Sainsbury's had caused had not endeared the owners to them.' </p> <p>And what of Dean, whose British Virgin Islands-registered company is earning at least \u00a3280,000 interest a year under the option contract while the issue is thrashed out? </p> <p>Is he happy? Not really. He is furious that his property is no longer central to redevelopment. His lawyer said: 'Mr Dean feels that the rug has been pulled from under his feet. [He] feels very badly let down by the stance now taken by WCC and Transport for London. The position is highly unsatisfactory.' </p> <p>Yet even if Sainsbury's does not buy his property, he is guaranteed \u00a31.25m, or twice the market value, whichever is the greater, by WEGP. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's, desperate to recoup its outlay, is resisting the proposals on traffic and design grounds and insisting that number 283 is an essential part of the redevelopment. It threatened on Friday to seek judicial review if the inquiry recommends approval of WEGP's plans. </p> <p>Planning inquiry outcomes are notoriously difficult to predict. Sainsbury's chances of winning the Edgware Road prize are anybody's guess. Put it this way: You would not bet \u00a310m on it... or even \u00a34m. Why did they?</p>",
  "<p>The sugar industry is planning to offer substantial sums of sponsorship money to the World Health Organisation as part of a secret attempt to influence the body's attempts to combat obesity worldwide.</p> <p>The Observer has obtained a confidential briefing document outlining the sugar producers' new strategy for getting into the key meetings held in the WHO's Geneva headquarters.</p> <p>The document was written by the British head of the World Sugar Research Organisation, which is wholly funded by sugar producers. It reveals the body's intention to offer a large amount of funding in order to be granted non-governmental organisation (NGO) status - something it has so far been denied.</p> <p>But the document also shows how the organisation has analysed whether the key WHO officials are hostile to its interests, highlighting its desire to win over policymakers who will have a big influence on countries that are trying to improve their national diet.</p> <p>The document has dismayed officials at WHO and food campaigners, who believe the industry is trying to subvert attempts to introduce policies aimed at reducing sugar levels.</p> <p>After being shown the document, Professor Philip James - a world authority on food who drafted the first report warning of the threat of obesity back in 1990 and is now chair of the International Obesity Taskforce - said: 'This is a ruthless and vicious strategy to undermine the work being done around the world to enable people to have healthier diets.</p> <p>'Does the sugar industry really believe it can bribe the WHO? Has it come to this?'</p> <p>Evidence is mounting that sugar is not only the cause of tooth decay, but also one of the major causes of obesity and heart disease. Nutritionists believe governments should be doing far more to warn the public of the dangers of foods which contain high sugar levels. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the WHO produced its Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, in the face of lobbying from food manufacturers and, in particular, countries with strong sugar interests. The industry managed to ensure that the strategy did not refer to an expert report, known as 916, which recommended that no more than 10 per cent of an adult's daily calorific intake should come from added sugar. </p> <p>But, at the same time, Britain and France were instrumental in preventing the sugar lobby from being granted NGO status at the meetings, despite intense pressure from the United States and elsewhere. However, such opposition has not stopped its attempts.</p> <p>A report prepared by Dr Richard Cottrell, director general of the WSRO and head of the Sugar Bureau in London, was written after an informal meeting this summer with Andre Prost, a WHO director with reponsibility for liaising between his organisation and private industry.</p> <p>'It is clear that WSRO will need to offer some form of collaboration with WHO, involving substantial sponsorship, to be considered for NGO status,' Cottrell writes. He adds: 'What is not clear is the extent of sponsorship expected and whether it will be possible to identify a project that would be acceptable to WHO but of direct value to the sugar industry.'</p> <p>The document also names officials whom they believe to be blocking their way. 'It is also clear that certain individuals connected with Report 916 remain implacably hostile to the sugar industry, including [Derek] Yach.' Yach, a key figure in formulating the 916 report, has since left.</p> <p>'Fortunately,' Cottrell continues, ' there does not now seem to be a defined group of anti-sugar staff within WHO.' However, Cottrell also suggests that the head of WHO, Lee Jong-Wook, may not be in place for too long. 'Dr Lee is apparently not inclined to allow WHO to become heavily involved in implementing any diet and health activities. He is himself under pressure, however, as a result of the poor performance of several of his senior appointees.'</p> <p>The report illustrates the measures the industry is prepared to adopt to circumvent an international attempt to improve public health. The US Sugar Association questioned the validity of the 916 report at every stage, and even suggested to President Bush that he withdraw funding from WHO unless the 10 per cent recommendation was withdrawn.</p> <p>It also emerged earlier this year that the US had submitted a 30-page report criticising the WHO for its lack of scientific evidence. 'Big sugar' gives millions of dollars to the Republican party, and to the the Bush campaign, and the President's administration argued that there was little robust evidence to show that eating too much sugar was a direct cause of obesity.</p> <p>Leading scientists took up the cause shortly before the crucial World Health Assembly meeting in May, accusing the US of making the health of millions of young Americans 'a hostage to fortune' because they had failed to combat their own epidemic of a diet laden with fat and sugar. </p> <p>But today's new document shows that the sugar battle is far from over and that the industry is intent on entering into the discussions. </p> <p>Cottrell was yesterday determined to defend his position, despite the leaking of his own report. He said: 'We are not expecting [to have] undue influence; we simply want an opportunity to make our expertise available.' </p> <p>But the report was met with astonishment at the WHO, which countered any suggestion that sponsorship money would win the industry a place at the discussion table. </p> <p>Dr Catherine le Galles-Camus, assistant director of the department dealing with the global strategy, said: 'They know we are not keen to see some trade association being recognised as an NGO. </p> <p>'From the beginning, they [the sugar industry] have used these tactics. We do work with the private sector but only as far as it is committed to preventing disease.'</p>",
  "<p>It is an unlikely coalition: London Mayor Ken Livingstone, Tory leader Michael Howard, Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Matthew Taylor of the Lib Dems. They all agree something must be done about the bete noire of the modern road: the four-by-four, or sports utility vehicle (SUV). </p> <p>The complaints are familiar: 'Chelsea tractors' clog up urban streets loaded with chil dren on the way to school or chicken nuggets bound for the freezer, pumping out carbon dioxide and threatening road surfaces, pedestrians and other motorists with their weight, bull bars and height. </p> <p>They may be used by politicians as handy symbols of ostentation and excessive consumption, but demand for them has risen unchecked since the early Nineties, despite growing fears about climate change... Now the backlash is coming. Regulations are being considered or introduced here and in the US to force manufacturers to make cleaner vehicles (Schwarzenegger), impose higher vehicle excise duty or congestion charges (Taylor and Tim Yeo, Howard's environment spokesman), ban bull bars (Livingstone), and bar heavy vehicles from residential streets (the Santa Monica transport department). The regulations are usually designed to hit all high-emission vehicles, but the invective most often hits the SUV. </p> <p>This is going to hurt the industry. Through what has been a barren period, particularly for the US giants, SUVs have been a key factor in keeping the business afloat outside low-cost Asia. Citigroup automotive analyst John Lawson says: 'It has been the long-term growth segment of the North American industry and in the past two or three years in Europe as well.' </p> <p>Figures produced by auto industry consultancy Global Insight show a 72 per cent increase between 1995 and 2000, from 3.1 million vehicles to 5.3 million worldwide, while in the US they have soared from 930,000 in 1990 to 4.8 million this year. The impact on profits has been even more dramatic. Lawson adds: 'The rates of growth are going to be more than threatened.' </p> <p>Global Insight's figures show that SUV sales will continue to grow in future, though at diminished levels. Sales are expected to hit 7.7 million in 2005, up 43 per cent on 2000. They are forecast to grow to 9.8 million in 2009. </p> <p>But SUVs are not expected to go the way of the dinosaurs amid the hostile environment of a maturing market, $50-a-barrel oil and a welter of environmental, congestion, weight and safety measures. It is more likely that they will evolve to survive. </p> <p>The drive behind the growth in SUVs has been product innovation. Nick Matthews, senior fellow of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, says this reflects the fact that the SUV was born from one of only two 'breakthrough' products in car design in the past 50 years - the Range Rover in the early 1970s. The other was the prototype people carrier, the Renault Espace in the 1980s. </p> <p>'The Range Rover was launched and everybody copied it; then the model diversified,' he says. From this followed Toyota's Land Cruiser and, in the mid-Nineties, the start of smaller vehicles, such as Toyota's Rav4. Now there are five accepted sub-categories, ranging from the luxury/full-size Jeep Grand Cherokees and Porsche Cayennes, through compacts (such as the Rav4 or Honda CRV) to mini-SUVs such as Daihatsu's Terios Kid. </p> <p>In the US, growth has focused on the massive 'Yank tanks' and their popularity remains, as indicated by the huge civilianised military Humvees on the streets this year. US tax incentives have encouraged manufacturers to build bigger, heavier (and higher-emission) SUVs. A sales tax credit first intended for commercial vehicles or light trucks - classified as over 6,000lb - is now applicable to full-size wagons from Ford or GM or luxury models from BMW and Porsche. </p> <p>These commercial vehicles are also exempted from total emissions limits imposed on US manufacturers. The effect has been a proliferation of monster and chic SUVs. US manufacturers are determined that these exemptions should remain, and are fighting to ensure that initiatives such as Schwarzenegger's or Santa Monica's are not repeated by less forward-looking states than California. </p> <p>But pressure is mounting, and experts believe that the highest-volume growth will be from manufacturers that reduce SUV size, weight and emissions. This could provide an entry into the market for European makers, along with established Asian brands. </p> <p>Philip Rosengarten of Global Insight says: 'The important thing so far has been that the growth has more or less happened in the E [full-size/ luxury] segment. We expect some growth in the D [Ford Explorer, Toyota Highlander], but most of all it will come in the C [compact] segment... We expect launches from Volkswagen, Renault and Fiat.' </p> <p>Rosengarten accepts that regulations may encourage change, but believes consumer preferences and product innovations will be more important. 'And [remember] people feel more protected in these vehicles because the impact they have on smaller cars in a crash is very bad.' </p> <p>The impact of a shift towards smaller SUVs on US manufacturers is shown in GI's sales forecasts. While GI expects Ford to see 15 per cent growth between this year and 2009, GM 30 per cent, and Daimler/Chrysler 65 per cent, it is looking at 269 per cent from Volkswagen, 914 per cent from Renault - while Fiat is simply off the scale. </p> <p>The Europeans are starting from much lower positions and the margins in smaller products are slimmer. But their domestic markets have been growing - in the UK, the SUV share of the total has risen from 4.5 per cent in 1999 to 6.8 per cent in 2004, while in the EU it has gone from 3.8 to 5.2 per cent. </p> <p>In the US, SUVs were not immune to dismal August sales figures. For example, Ford's UK-based Land-Rover subsidiary has seen US sales fall by 15 per cent so far this year. The Ford Expedition full-size vehicle has dropped 12.7 per cent, while its Explorer fell 6.7 per cent. </p> <p>The US giants are not taking it lying down. Last month Ford launched the Escape, billed as the first 'hybrid' SUV, able to run on electricity and conventional fuel. </p> <p>But Rosengarten says: 'It is possible to see what happened to the car market in the Nineties happening to SUVs in the next 10 years: increased competition and pressure on margins. For the Americans it will be difficult. In the Nineties they faced pressure from the Asians in small and medium-sized cars at the bottom end, and from European makers such as BMW and Mercedes at the top. SUVs were the answer. Now they are under attack too.'</p>",
  "<p>Sky-high oil prices have put BP on course to make $16 billion (\u00a39bn) this year, the largest profit ever recorded by a British company, according to City analysts.</p> <p>The news will infuriate consumer groups.

Research group TNS Petrol Panel reported recently that BP's prices had on average been up to 2.5p a litre dearer than its competitors'. </p> <p>Tomorrow, BP will issue a trading statement but will play down City forecasts of its massive windfall, with 2004 profits up 25 per cent on 2003. Instead, it will concentrate on production targets and refining margins, which are under pressure in the US. </p> <p>Ironically, many brokers believe BP's shares are getting toppy after a strong run this year. </p> <p>But BP will leapfrog HSBC, which recorded a profit of \u00a37bn in May, to become the richest company in the UK. The oil giant, headed by Lord Browne, records its profits in dollars to take account of the large number of US shareholders on its register. </p> <p>The company has always maintained that it needs its cash to reinvest in the business. But analysts have been upgrading their profit forecasts as they expect that BP will benefit from high oil prices for some time to come. US crude has breached $50 a barrel in recent days. It is expected to remain there throughout the winter. </p> <p>An industry source added: 'Factor in the risk of disruption to supplies from places such as Iraq and you can bet that the price won't go down any time soon.'</p> <p><strong>Oil price jeopardises world growth, says G7</strong></p> <p>Rocketing oil prices are endangering global growth, finance ministers from the world's richest nations have warned. </p> <p>'Oil prices remain high and are a risk,' G7 finance ministers said in a statement issued after their meeting in Washington. They urged oil producers to 'provide adequate supplies to ensure prices moderate'.</p> <p>The economic outlook was 'favourable', but they advised against complacency.</p>",
  "British plans to win international support for writing off the debt of the world's poorest countries were scuppered yesterday after the Group of Seven rich nations failed to reach agreement. <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown failed to persuade his fellow finance ministers, meeting in Washington, to follow Britain's pledge to provide \u00a3100 million a year to help pay off 10 per cent of Third World debt to the World Bank and the African Development Bank. </p> <p>France and Germany resisted the idea, which had received the backing of the US, and in the end the G7 nations agreed only to 'the sustainability of debt of the poorest countries by making progress on debt relief and grant financing'. </p> <p>Charities and aid agencies voiced bitter disappointment at the news, which comes ahead of this week's visit to Africa by Tony Blair. </p> <p>'G7 finance ministers have failed to join together to match the action on debt taken by the UK,' said Oxfam policy adviser Max Lawson. 'Once again rich countries have turned up with notebooks, not chequebooks, and the price will be paid by the world's poorest people.' </p> <p>Action Aid policy adviser Patrick Watt said each day of delay by the G7 left poor countries paying out $100 million that could be spent on health and education. </p> <p>Brown had been optimistic about his proposal to use International Monetary Fund gold reserves to write off multilateral debt. He had planned to revalue on paper the IMF gold to pay for debt relief. However, he is said to confident that he can eventually win over the G7 and is encouraging aid agencies to keep up the pressure on the 'dissident' governments. </p> <p>'I have sent a postcard reminding the German finance ministry they had their debts removed after the war,' he told The Observer. </p> <p>'We think debt relief is not the only solution,' said French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. 'What we want are real, supplementary ways to help these countries... and we especially want to give this money to the countries to form education and socialisation programmes, not simply give it to the banks.' </p> <p>The Prime Minister's trip to Africa, which begins on Tuesday, will coincide with the second meeting of the Commission for Africa, the brainchild of Sir Bob Geldof, the founder of Live Aid. Blair will be joined in Africa by Geldof and Hilary Benn, Secretary of State at the Department for International Development (DFID). </p> <p>A spokeswoman for DFID said: 'At Labour party conference, international development was not just a fringe issue. It was right at the heart of what was being said. This is about social justice on a global scale.' </p> <p>The meeting of the Commission for Africa - set up last February to promote prosperity there - will take place in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa from next Thursday.</p>",
  "The Tories will only win power by showing they have changed and they can do more than talk tough on crime, shadow cabinet minister Andrew Lansley said yesterday. <p>His warning, ahead of tomorrow's party conference in Bournemouth, came as a poll revealed swing voters are more than three times as likely to consider Tony Blair 'in touch' with their fears than leader Michael Howard. </p> <p>In what will be seen as a clear rebuke to those pushing for the party to pander to the right, the Tory health spokesman said voters had 'always imagined' the Tories would tackle hardline issues, but needed reassuring over fears 'they had to trade off with investment in the health service in exchange'. </p> <p>The warning is especially pointed coming from Lansley, who worked closely with William Hague on the 2001 election campaign in which the Tories disastrously dropped messages about public services in favour of shrill pronouncements on Europe, crime and immigration. </p> <p>'What 2001 tells you forcibly is that if you have not defined yourself before the election campaign arrives, you will be defined by your opponents and by the media,' Lansley said. </p> <p>'William had enormous abilities and talents and actually cared deeply about changing the Conservative party and bringing issues like health and education to the forefront, but you can't change the public's perception of you in the last three weeks. We are seeking to achieve that before the election arrives, people understand how the Conservative party has changed.'.' </p> <p>Plans to focus on public service pledges could however be overshadowed by fresh debate over tax, after deregulation spokesman John Redwood called for an \u00a318 billion package of tax cuts, including slash ing the top rate of income tax to 30 per cent. </p> <p>His ideas - which contradict party policy - come in a book written before he rejoined the frontbench, to be published this week. </p> <p>This week Howard's team will each issue detailed timetables for their first days and weeks in office if the Tories win, with Lansley promising to scrap hospital star ratings on his first day in office and crack down on the hospital superbug MRSA. </p> <p>He defended Tory plans to subsidise patients who pay for treatment, arguing it would help prevent 'hundreds of thousands' of previously private patients returning to the NHS - and causing new bottlenecks - as waits for surgery come down. </p> <p>Howard will use his conference speech not only to flesh out his own personal timetable, but to make the moral case for low taxation, although there will be no concrete tax cut pledges. </p> <p>However today's ICM poll for the New Frontiers Foundation think-tank suggests a mountain to climb, with 40 per cent of voters unhappy with Blair but saying they still prefer him to the Tories. </p> <p>Labour is rated more 'in touch with the issues that most concern you' by 49 per cent to 32: Blair is considered more 'competent' than Howard by 50 per cent to 29. Crucially, among potential swingers back to the Tories, 69 per cent consider Blair more in touch and 73 per cent more competent. </p> <p>Dominic Cummings, director of the NFF and former Tory head of strategy, said the Tories needed talented people and a structure 'that is adaptive to an ever-changing and unknowable environment'. It was 'not plausible', he said, for the current party to articulate the messages voters would want to hear. </p> <p>Privately Tories say their internal polling shows Howard level pegging with Blair on key personal attributes demanded of a prime minister, such as experience. But Lansley admitted Howard's time as a Home Secretary under John Major was a 'two-edged sword', since voters had got rid of Major. </p> <p>The shadow health secretary is considered by some on the Tories' moderate wing as a potential leadership contender, if a contest were to be held after the next election. Asked by The Observer if he would stand should Howard fall under the proverbial bus, he declined to rule it out categorically, saying: 'I think it's an idle and vain pursuit to think about anything other than supporting Michael Howard, who I believe will be a fine Prime Minister.'</p>",
  "They say that with age comes wisdom - but not always, perhaps, tact. John Reid, the Health Secretary, has risked the wrath of his more mature colleagues by suggesting sixtysomething politicians should 'get out of the road' and give younger people a go. <p>At a sprightly 57 himself, Reid is hardly a thrusting young upstart. But asked whether he thought compulsory sabbaticals for politicians were a good idea to stop them getting carried away, he said last week: 'My own view is that when you get to your mid-60s, get out of the road and let some of the younger people come along. </p> <p>'I remember people like Tony Benn and Dennis Skinner saying that when they were my age - although they seem to have changed their minds now.' </p> <p>Reid, who has been an MP for 17 years, admitted he might live to regret his words when he reached pensionable age himself. He may, however, regret them rather sooner: John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister whom many younger Labour MPs would dearly love to see retire, is now 66 - although still capable of an impressive right hook when required, as the 'rumble in Rhyl' during the last election proved. At 61, Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett, a veteran of the Callaghan administration, has also collected her bus pass. </p> <p>Reid would presumably be less unhappy, however, to see the back of Tory leader Michael Howard, an energetic 63. But as a keen amateur historian, he will know his comments would have ruled out Winston Churchill, who was 65 when he took office for the first time and 81 when ill health forced his resignation - even if he did need to be fuelled by copious tots of brandy and an afternoon nap. </p> <p>Neville Chamberlain, too, was 68 when he took office, while Gladstone was 84 when he left it: the oldest man to enter Downing Street was Viscount Palmerston, who was 70 when he began his final term in office, but continued to live up to his nickname 'Firebrand Palmerston'. </p> <p>While there has been no modern pensioner premier, the summer spat between the so-called 'Notting Hill set' of Tories - derided for sitting around in bistros all day planning their career moves - and the elderly MPs they dubbed 'bedblockers' for their refusal to relinquish Westminster seats illustrated the frustrations of ambitious MPs. </p> <p>Aides insisted yesterday that Reid had meant nothing more by his comments - made at fringe meeting at the Labour party conference last week - than to stress that, having given up smoking and got fit, he hoped to put his feet up one day: 'He wants to have a long and happy retirement with [his wife] Carine. He'd like to have a chance to spend more quality time with her.' </p> <p>But the charity Age Concern said the Health Secretary should know better. 'We hear from people in all sorts of different professions who are being forced out in their 50s and over, but older people have got so much to offer in later life,' said a spokeswoman. 'We have done some research showing that people don't think older people should make way for younger people: the person doing the job should be the best person for it.' </p> <p>The Government is currently seeking to abolish the mandatory retirement age which currently allows employees to be forced out at the age of 65 - although employers have warned that would cause precisely the tensions Reid hinted at between older staff refusing to budge, and restlessly ambitious younger workers. </p> <p>Initial talks were held last week between unions, employers and other interested parties on the new Mandatory Retirement Age Commission, set up to thrash out a compromise. Employers are now pushing for a deal under which the retirement age of 65 would be scrapped, allowing workers to carry on if they want, but only up to 70, when their bosses would be allowed to intervene.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Guernica: The Biography of a Twentieth-Century Icon</strong><br>by Gijs van Hensbergen<br>Bloomsbury \u00a320, pp352</p> <p>Modern wars rely on the armed exchange of images as much as on missiles. Hitler mobilised German music to celebrate his campaign of global conquest: he decided to send the Luftwaffe to support the Spanish rebels in 1936 after attending a performance of Wagner's Siegfried at Bayreuth, so the operation was given the operatic code name Magic Fire. And after those planes bombed the Basque town of Guernica, the outrage of the freedom fighters was articulated by a painting, which became the unofficial flag of the partisans.</p> <p>Picasso's Guernica - whose complex sources and combative afterlife are examined in Gijs van Hensbergen's brilliant study - began as a topical response to the first manifestation of total war, which indiscriminately rained down death on civilians. But it has become the twentieth century's graphic self-castigation: a religious painting (which is why Hensbergen rightly calls it an icon) for a godless, iconolastic age. The massacre in the blitzed town replaced the Crucifixion as a dramatisation of cruelty and inhumanity, all the more compelling because its excruciated victims include women, children and a rearing, traumatised horse; it also served, as a Californian curator remarked in 1939, as our contemporary version of the Last Judgment, an apocalypse with 'nowhere the promise of paradise'.</p> <p>The grandiose painting - so large that the canvas had to be jammed at an angle into Picasso's vast studio in Paris, just as traffic lights needed to be removed to accommodate the truck that took it from the Prado to the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum in Madrid in 1992 - was terminal in other senses too. Anthony Blunt once called it 'the last great painting in the European tradition'. The atavism of its forms - the twisted, malevolent bull, the butchered women - allude to cave paintings, savagely reconceived by Picasso the primitivist. But the prehistoric gloom is illuminated by electricity: the flaring light bulb in the sky pays homage to the Italian futurists, who saw the combustion of an electric filament as a symbol of tragedy.</p> <p>Along with its quotations from Italian Renaissance altar-pieces, Guernica mimics the monumental pomp of nineteenth-century art. The woman with the gasping, horrified face, who holds out a lamp with her elongated arm, is Picasso's deformation of the Statue of Liberty brandishing her torch to enlighten the world. The ritualised slaughter of the bullfight here encounters a modern, mechanised kind of death and the grey stripes and stippling of the texture hint at the grubby look of newsprint. Guernica begins in an underground, neolithic Europe, but is as up-to-date as yesterday's inky headlines.</p> <p>There is no doubting the helpless grief that provoked the painting, yet the irony of the work lies in the affinity between Picasso's creative procedures and the ruthlessness of the warmongers. Hensbergen's tributes to Guernica are ambivalent: he notes that Picasso 'cannibalised' motifs from earlier art and can't help admitting that the ferocity with which he wracked bodies was 'sadistic'. The painter's own female hostages, those ravaged mistresses who were his temporary muses, suffered for its sake. The figure whose pose recalls the Statue of Liberty is his deposed companion Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se; the woman who weeps is her successor Dora Maar. Picasso said that if you scratched the canvas, blood would seep from it, even though its palette is an anaemic grey. That blood, if you read Guernica autobiographically, belonged to his abject, exploited bedmates.</p> <p>Is Guernica a critique of violence or an orgiastic rampage by a painter for whom a work of art was, as he said, 'the sum of its destructions'? In 1974, while it was still on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, an Iranian artist sprayed a slogan across it with red paint, calling his vandalism an act of creative collaboration. Its protective coat of varnish saved it; returned to Madrid in the 1980s, it was at first displayed inside a steel cage; the new museum at Bilbao, appealing for its return to Basque territory, planned to house it in a polycarbon coffer containing anti-inflammatory material. The precautions recognised its financial value, but also acknowledged its incendiary, combustible force.</p> <p>Icons are relics of divinity, yet our commercial culture bleeds them of sanctity. Guernica, which denounced the lethal mechanisation of the modern world, was soon gobbled up by the ravenous, profitable logic of mechanical reproduction. When it was first exhibited in New York, the department stores on Fifth Avenue cashed in on its notoriety by dressing their windows with 'clothes inspired by the world's greatest living artist'. Aesthetic reverence restores a false sanctity to it: the space Frank Gehry set aside for it in his titanium-clad folly in Bilbao was piously nicknamed 'The Chapel'.</p> <p>All the same, Guernica retains its power to offend, and still goads politicians and diplomats - like the Francoists who kept it in exile - to suppress it. The United Nations in New York has a copy of it in tapestry, donated by Nelson Rockefeller (who had to accept this as second best when Picasso refused to sell him the original). It hangs in a corridor outside the Security Council's meeting room, where it acts as a visible conscience and a memento mori.</p> <p>Last year, however, when Colin Powell attempted to scare the UN into legitimising the Iraq war, the tapestry was suddenly covered by a blue shroud. A spokesman explained that its blacks, whites and greys confused the television cameras; the truth, as Hensbergen points out, is that the tapestry derided the American officials who so sanctimoniously briefed the press while standing in front of it. This censorship recognises the contemporaneity of Guernica. The mouths of its figures, like wounds, still gape open and the silent screams they emit are audible to everyone except the militarists they accuse.</p>",
  "<p>Seven consecutive victories, their first one-day final since 1992, England's cricketers are on a roll. They have reached the happy position where the selection dilemma is who to leave out rather than who to draft in. When Michael Vaughan was injured early in the summer they called up Andrew Strauss and he responded by making a century in each of his Lord's Tests. When Graham Thorpe retired from one-day cricket they called upon Strauss to fill his role as the team's finisher. The intention had been that Strauss solve a short-term problem, instead he looks set to fill two roles in the long-term. </p> <p>'It's been a fantastic summer for me personally,' says Strauss. 'I'd never have dreamed of doing what I've done and, more importantly, it's been a privilege to be part of this England side and what they've achieved. It's pretty satisfying.' </p> <p>Which among the many achievements was the most satisfying? 'For me, beating the Australians was the highlight of the summer. I felt we had a real opportunity to show how far we have come as a side. Psychologically, it was more important for us than them. To prove to ourselves that we could beat them.' </p> <p>Having achieved this for the first time in more than five years they reverted to type by surprising everyone, not least their opponents, by proving they could lose to the West Indies. 'There was no doubt that it was devastating,' he says. 'We had them at 140 for eight. But it shows you that when a side isn't under pressure to score runs quickly it can be hard to force people out.' </p> <p>He is suitably complimentary to the West Indies pair, Ian Bradshaw and Courtenay Browne, who finished the job for their side and their decision not to take the light even though it was dark and Steve Harmison was flinging it down at speeds in the mid-90s. 'It was a tough one,' he says. 'They had a lot of momentum going in their favour and they could almost sense that we were searching around for ideas as to how to get them out. It was a brave decision and they played Harmison really well. Fair play to them.' </p> <p>One reason for his success is that he wasn't selected until he was 27. 'It has definitely helped. I wouldn't have been ready even two years ago. I've only been playing professional cricket since I was 21 [he spent three years reading economics at Durham University] whereas others started at 17.' He has always been something of a late developer. At Caldicott prep school, where you might have expected a future England player to make a prodigious amount of runs, he 'didn't really. I was in the first XI for three years but I struggled to get the ball off the square. I only scored my first fifty at 11 or 12. I just didn't have the power. I didn't make my first century until I was 15 playing for Radley against an Australian side for the Silk Trophy. That made a big difference to my confidence.' </p> <p>Radley has become a successful breeding-ground for first-class cricketers. As well as Strauss, alumni include Robin Martin-Jenkins at Sussex and Ben Hutton and Jamie Dalrymple at Middlesex. Bert Robinson has been coaching at Radley for 55 years. 'Cricket's always been a great thing here,' he says, 'and I think people send their boys because they have been told that they will get the best treatment. Andy was always a good player. But I didn't think he'd get to this height. I think Jamie Dalrymple may prove to be the best of the lot.' </p> <p>The public-school education has led, as is so often the case, to an unfortunate nickname. 'I've been trying my hardest to get people to stop calling me Lord Brockett,' he says. 'But it is taking a long time and I haven't really succeeded.' </p> <p>It is a rare failure. Perhaps the only other one coming during a season for the Middlesex seconds, while he was at Durham, when he averaged a miserable 13. 'It was the only moment when I doubted myself and thought, \"Hang on a sec, I might not have what it takes to be a professional cricketer.\" I took a long hard look at myself and realised that if I wanted to play properly I would have to go to the gym and get fit. It was the only time I thought I might fail. It was fairly demoralising for a while. I made a couple of technical changes and since then everything has gone fairly well. There's been the odd blip but it's been an upward curve.' </p> <p>Even perfect preparation can be undone by the fates. 'There's no doubt that you need luck in life,' says Strauss, 'and in professional sport probably even more so. I had a helluva lot of luck to get my debut when Michael Vaughan was injured and I don't know what would have happened if he'd been fit. Some come in and don't do well; some do. Even then luck plays a part. You can get an unplayable delivery or you can get a flat wicket. You can't prepare for it.' </p> <p>He was undoubtedly helped by being selected for a winning team. 'We've benefited immensely from having a settled side. It is settled because we're winning and it becomes self-perpetuating. I've also benefited from knowing a lot of the guys [from being in the one-day squad] and the environment in the dressing room. Michael Vaughan is very inclusive as a captain and I don't feel there are any cliques or hierarchies.' </p> <p>It has been a long season and 'I've found it really tough. The increase in intensity is very draining and it's been non-stop all summer. Last Sunday morning I was dead on my feet.' This week he will play in the Dunhill Links Championship off a handicap of 'a steady seven. Paul Collingwood is the real bandit. He plays off six but it's more like three.' </p> <p>Then there will be a short break during which he will continue reading, 'Clive Woodward's autobiography, which is very interesting. I've met him a few times and he is a pretty inspirational bloke.' After that it will be back to the gym and then, after tours of Zimbabwe and South Africa, which he describes as 'an important hurdle on the way', there will be 'the massive series against Australia'. </p> <p>Given his recent run, it will not be a surprise if, having scored his first century against an Australian side in that schools match, he doubles up by scoring a century in his first Test match against Australia.</p>",
  "They are the quaintest of sports which, despite boasting few players, only a handful of fans and no stars, help to give the Olympic Games their unique appeal. <p>But the days of tae kwon do, modern pentathlon and equestrianism being part of the world's biggest sporting festival are numbered. They are set to be punished for their lack of popularity by being dropped from the Games. </p> <p>Olympic chiefs are planning to axe minority specialist sports and replace them with guaranteed crowd-pullers, such as golf and rugby, in a move which will outrage sporting traditionalists. </p> <p>Alarmed that the Olympics are increasingly seen as too staid, too out-of-touch and too dominated by the world's biggest countries, the International Olympic Committee is preparing a radical overhaul of the event intended to make it sexier, more global and better reflect sports which young people like. </p> <p>Baseball and softball are included among the sports facing the axe, while golf, rugby sevens, karate, squash and even roller-skating are being lined up as replacements. </p> <p>The IOC president, Jacques Rogge, is keen to boost the image of the four-yearly summer Olympics, which he and other senior IOC figures fear is too staid and unattractive to younger people who are into newer, more demanding pursuits, such as dirt-biking and extreme sports. IOC insiders describe the process as 'making the Games more relevant'. One source admitted: 'We're going to do this. We know there will be casualties, and we know this will cause a huge row.' </p> <p>An IOC working group is drawing up plans to modernise the sporting programme for the summer Olympics. Whatever changes are agreed will be introduced at the 2012 Games, which London might host. </p> <p>That raises the prospect of golf being played at Wentworth, Twickenham hosting rugby sevens and Hyde Park being used for competitive roller-skating. Sources in London's campaign to stage the event say they could easily use existing venues to accommodate any new sports the IOC decides to put in. </p> <p>Last week, the IOC confirmed that it was writing to the world governing bodies of five sports that could potentially add to the quality and popularity of the Games: golf, rugby, squash, karate and roller sports. All five are desperate to become part of the Olympics. </p> <p>The IOC says that the popularity of the Games largely depends on the content of the sports programme, which must be 'exciting, attractive, action-packed and athlete-focused. It must also reflect the constant evolution of public expectations.' </p> <p>Rogge tried to axe modern pentathlon, baseball and softball in 2002, but those sports fought successful campaigns to thwart him. But the experience of the 2004 Olympics in Athens in August has convinced IOC members that a revamping of the schedule is needed. Minority sports, such as equestrian, often drew small crowds in venues built especially for them at great cost, and for which there is no clear future use, given the sports' low profile in Greece. </p> <p>The IOC has decided that for every sport which comes in, one will have to go, as it intends to keep the maximum number of sports contested at 28. Golf and rugby are highly likely to be included, karate is tipped to replace tae kwon do, but squash is unlikely to supplant the three existing racquet sports of tennis, badminton or table tennis. </p> <p>Roller-skating is seen as an outside bet for inclusion in 2012. Although a popular pastime, few people realise that it is also a competitive sport. However, the IOC has already agreed other changes intended to modernise the Games, such as substituting two BMX cycling events for two track cycling contests at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. </p> <p>The IOC has drawn up 33 criteria to assess which sports should keep or lose their place, or gain admission. It has sent a questionnaire to the 28 existing sports and five potential new ones, requesting details of how many television viewers they attract, how much commercial sponsorship they raise, how many countries play them, how many women play, and how much they cost to stage. </p> <p>Olympic bosses are keen to make the Games a more truly global event. 'People in every country in the world play golf, but only a few do modern pentathlon. Also, many of the world's top golfers come from places such as South Africa and Fiji, which can only help,' explained one IOC source. 'And if we had rugby sevens, you could have teams from lots of small countries, rather than just the traditional big nations such as Britain and Australia.' </p> <p>The IOC will decide which sports are in and which will go in July 2005. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:denis.campbell@observer.co.uk\">denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "When Sophie McKenzie decided to start teaching at High View School in Derby, her mother cried and begged her not to ruin her career. <p>Last year the school was the third worst-performing in Britain. Bullying was rife, teachers resigned rather than be intimidated by both pupils and parents, and the majority of lessons were desperate exercises in crowd control.</p> <p>By the time High View was put into special measures - that is, judged by Ofsted to be failing or likely to fail to provide an acceptable standard of education - in January 2002, there had been a mass exodus of teachers and an increasing number of parents refused to send their children there.</p> <p>Last week the school offered The Observer unprecedented access by inviting a reporter to join its staff as a teaching assistant. It wanted to explain how a school in such a critical state could pull itself round. It also wanted people to know what it was like to teach in an institution with such problems.</p> <p>High View's 500 pupils come from an area with high levels of social and economic disadvantage; almost half are eligible for free school meals, while 34 per cent have special educational needs, more than twice the national average.</p> <p>In 1997 an Ofsted inspection judged the school had 'serious weaknesses', the final stage before special measures. With the head teacher unable to provide the leadership for its improvement, it began to implode. When Ofsted placed it in special measures, under which it came under the direct control of the Department for Education and Skills, a third of the teachers fled, forcing the school to double up lessons and rely on supply teachers. In 2003, only 7 per cent of pupils gained 5+ A*-C GCSE grades - a fall on the previous year's rock-bottom 12 per cent.</p> <p>In August, Derby city local education authority announced the closure of High View, reopening it last month under a new name with a new headteacher, management team and staffing structure. The closure threatened the jobs of all who worked at the school. Morale sank and strike action was threatened.</p> <p>'It was awful,' said Bob Randle, High View deputy head, now vice-principal at the new Da Vinci Community College. 'There was unspoken agreement between teachers, children and the community that this school produced failures. It was humiliating and depressing. I am still recovering from that period.' Pupils also suffered: 'People laugh at us for coming here,' said Kim Bousfield, 16. 'They think we're thick, but I don't care.' She does care, of course; all the students do.</p> <p>Although more state schools were put into special measures last year than any since Labour came to power, it is still extremely rare for a school to fail so completely - only 300 out of 22,000 triggered the status last year - and the effect is devastating. Pupils now in their first year are unaware of the chaos preceding their admission, but those who experienced even one year of the previous regime suffer its effect.</p> <p>'I'm not clever,' whispered one 12-year-old girl paralysed in fear at being asked to pick out the metaphors and similes in a poem. 'I don't understand anything.'</p> <p>Lack of self-esteem increases as pupils get older. By 16, most of the children are generally depressed about their inability to succeed. 'Our year 11 students have been through the most dramatic years in this school's history,' said Becky Murdoch, who joined at Easter as vice-principal. 'They have had a raw deal through no fault of their own, but through a really terrible set of circumstances. It's been awful for them.'</p> <p>It will take more than a new name, of course, to reconstruct the school's reputation and raise attainment. Not long ago only one 11-year-old out of a year's new intake of 100-plus children had the verbal reasoning skills expected for that age. On average, new pupils had reading skills two years below their chronological age.</p> <p>Da Vinci is an extreme example of why an influential committee of MPs called for extra pay to be made available to lure high-quality teachers into troubled inner-city secondary schools. When High View advertised for teachers, sometimes just a single applicant would apply. 'We need the absolute highest quality because they won't survive here otherwise,' said Randle. </p> <p>Arriving for my first day, I was expecting classrooms under siege by pupils who fought and brawled with a complete lack of respect for their teachers and each other. Instead, children smartly dressed in colour co-ordinated uniforms flowed between classes with only the normal jostling common to any school day, raising their voices only to cheerfully greet a teacher at the far end of a corridor. </p> <p>'We don't have hard, nasty kids here, but we have desperately needy ones,' said Randle. 'Their behaviour is just attention-seeking, but responding to their constant need for support and affirmation is like being sucked dry. Their self-esteem is so brittle that it doesn't take very much to knock it; when that happens, they sometimes react aggressively, which can be scary if you're not used to it.' </p> <p>When Da Vinci opened, it was under executive head Carol Dibbs, head of Lees Brook Community Sports College, a successful neighbouring school. She has worked in challenging schools all her career and her reputation is such that, when word spread she had taken over, teachers began to apply for posts at the school for the first time in years. Dibbs's approach is tough but simple, and in June, with the same teachers, the school came out of special measures in record time. </p> <p>'My approach is pretty straightforward,' said Dibbs. 'We focused on improving teaching and learning and providing a clear educational direction while improving students' progress, behaviour, attendance and attitudes.' </p> <p>She introduced strict rules and clear boundaries, giving teachers total support. The rules include a firm insistence on politeness and respect and wearing correct dress code. Swearing, aggressive behaviour and bullying are not tolerated; disruptive behaviour in lessons is dealt with swiftly. There is a full quota of permanent staff with none planning to leave. </p> <p>'My mother cried when I said I was coming here, but all she saw was a failing school; she didn't see what was on the inside,' said McKenzie, student progress and achievement manager for year 7 pupils and English teacher. 'There were times when it would have been easy to leave, but this school takes hold of you. I know what these children's lives are like at home, and I know that when they go back there after the school day is over, I have made a real difference.' </p> <p>From The Observer's time at the school, that lure is clear. Asked to read the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet , a GCSE English student, who has chosen to sit at the back of the class, shoved her book across the table in disgust. 'I don't understand any of this,' she spat. 'I'm just too stupid.' It took time to coax her to take her head out of her hands, but by the end of the lesson she and I had worked out how Romeo uses the image of the sun to refer to Juliet, then draws the stars and heavens into his metaphor. </p> <p>'I guess he uses such stupid words because he feels so strongly about Juliet that normal words won't do,' she mused, leafing through the play to see what comes next. 'I wish someone felt that strongly towards me. Thanks, miss,' she said, looking straight at me for the first time and smiling. 'That was good.' </p> <p>The school's walls are plastered with displays dedicated to building the children's self-esteem. 'Who I Am Is Important', one child has written. 'I am a good friend', says another. 'My teacher says I work hard', another announces proudly. The June Ofsted inspection that removed the school from special measures - seven months after Dibbs took over - praised the improvements. 'Acceptable behaviour has become the norm,' it drily announced. </p> <p>Dibbs put it better: 'We have created a disciplined and caring environment, where pupils' self-confidence is being rebuilt.' A year 11 student put it better still: 'It might have been bad before, but it's really good now. I'm glad this is my school. No, it's more than that - I'm proud it's my school.'</p>",
  "<p>At first, it looked like yet another battle of the animation behemoths: DreamWorks's gangsta comedy Shark Tale versus Disney/Pixar's superhero comedy The Incredibles. One boasts a big-star line-up and a hip hop soundtrack; the other is the first Pixar movie directed by an outsider, Brad Bird (one of the key creators of The Simpsons). DreamWorks had selected 5 November for Shark Tale 's launch, but backed off after Disney chose the same weekend for The Incredibles . </p> <p>Now DreamWorks's decision to go for an early October release looks like a blessing in disguise. The studio has expertly deployed its star power to build global awareness. The company rode Will Smith, Angelina Jolie and Jack Black through the harbour on the back of a fake shark at Cannes. Last month, it flew Robert De Niro, Smith and Jolie to Venice. More significantly DreamWorks attached the Shark Tale trailer to Shrek 2, which has earned $436.5 million at the North American box office. </p> <p>Luckily, Shark Tale opens a month ahead of The Incredibles. Expectations are already running high, because the animation outfit run by John Lasseter can seemingly do no wrong. They are currently five for five: Toy Story 1 and 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo were all worldwide blockbusters. </p> <p>The Incredibles doesn't share the same look as the other Pixar movies - and it looks way cool. This The Simpsons meets James Bond story features Pixar's first human protagonists. There's Bob Pair alias Mr Incredible (Craig T Nelson), a retired superhero in glasses who can barely squeeze into his old red supersuit. His wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), still uses her special skills to keep order at the family dinner table. </p> <p>Together, they return to action for a remote island assignment, along with their old colleague Frozone (Samuel L Jackson). Disney marketers are so high on The Incredibles that they've decided not to settle for the animation category in their Oscar campaign. They're going for Best Picture. 'This groundbreaking achievement in film-making,' declares Disney spokesman Dennis Rice, 'just happens to be animated.' </p> <p><strong>The wordsmith of Oz</strong></p> <p>In Hollywood, it's rare for a $100 million studio movie starring Tom Cruise to generate rave reviews for the screenplay, much less carry a solo writing credit. Thanks to Collateral, a moody LA character study about a sociopathic hitman and the passive taxi driver he hires to take him to his targets, 33-year-old Australian Stuart Beattie has morphed from up-and-comer to A-lister overnight. Beattie's next project, Derailed , starts filming this autumn in London with Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston. Shakur Kapur's Rwanda drama 100 Days of Darkness is next, starring Djimon Hounsou, followed by Warner Independent's Truce, about British soldiers in the trenches in the First World War. Writing from nine to five in the Hollywood home he shares with his wife and two small boys, Beattie is now busily adapting the fantasy bestseller Artemis Fowl for Miramax, Tom Clancy's Without Remorse for Paramount, and the Steve Niles vampire comic 30 Days of Night for Spider-Man director Sam Raimi. </p> <p>One night in 1991, after hitting it off with the cab driver on the way home from Sydney airport, Beattie recalls thinking: 'I could be a homicidal maniac. You never get in a car with a stranger, never pick up a hitcher, but a cab driver defies those rules. Taxis are mini-islands floating around the city with two people in a confined space. It was rife for drama.' </p> <p>Two of Beattie's early scripts were made into films in Australia, the family flick Joey and the romantic comedy Kick. 'I couldn't learn over there,' he says. 'There was only one film school in the whole country.' Beattie took the Collateral script to Oregon State University, then moved to Los Angeles in 1992, supporting himself by day at Taco Bell as he studied screenwriting by night at UCLA Extension. </p> <p>After he won UCLA's Diane Thomas Screenwriting Award, Beattie signed with a Hollywood literary agent. First he tried to sell Quest for the Caribbean , his idea for reviving the pirate genre. ' Cutthroat Island and Pirates hadn't done well, so everyone thought pirate movies didn't work,' Beattie says. 'My philosophy is: good movies are in, bad movies are out.' But Disney went with another writer. Beattie was waiting tables at the Stage Deli when he ran into producer Julie Richardson. She liked his Collateral idea. First, they developed the script for HBO, which passed. Then Dreamworks bought Collateral in 1999. After three years of rewrites and running through a gamut of directors and stars, Beattie thought: 'They're never going to make it.' </p> <p>The script was good enough to inspire Disney to bring him back to write Pirates of the Caribbean ; his draft brought in the mighty Jerry Bruckheimer, who hired Shrek 's Terry Rosso &amp; Ted Elliott. 'The middle writer always gets screwed,' says Beattie, who shared a story credit. When Michael Mann took over Collateral , he brought in his star on The Insider , Russell Crowe. And when Crowe dropped out over scheduling problems, Cruise came in. </p> <p>As soon as Beattie's movie had names like Mann and Cruise attached to it, his career took off. 'People want you to write their stuff, to get Cruise and Mann again,' he says. Producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura sent Beattie the 2003 potboiler Derailed, and liked his Hitchcockian take on it. Finally, Beattie had the freedom to work on something no one was asking him to write: 100 Days of Darkness , a drama about the Rwanda genocide. After hearing Bill Clinton's 1998 speech apologising for not trying to halt the killing, 'I was unable to forget about it,' he says. 'It happened 10 years ago; history is doomed to repeat itself if we forget it.' These stories all have one thing in common, he says: 'They're about who you are in the world, and who you want to be.' </p> <p><strong>Story of my life story</strong></p> <p>Poor Kevin Spacey. The voraciously talented Oscar-winner, currently taking a panning in London, finally raises the money to make his labour of love, the Bobby Darin biopic, Beyond the Sea. He sings, he dances, he acts, he produces and directs this ambitious homage. The movie grabs kudos at September's Toronto International Film Festival. But the film that gets the monster boost as the Oscar-bound biopic to watch is Taylor Hackford's Ray . This movie is a more mainstream, bigger-budget feature starring Jamie Foxx (above, who costars with Tom Cruise in Collateral ) as the recently departed gospel/ r'n'b star. And Foxx doesn't even sing his own songs. They're by Ray Charles. Damn.</p> <p><strong>Well, I do declare</strong></p> <p>Veteran TV producer Charles Segars knows a good story idea when he hears one. Five years ago, he was doing research at the National Archive in Washington, DC when he overheard an 8th grader who was peering at the framed Declaration of Independence. 'It's disappearing ink; I can't read it,' he complained. Sure enough, the document had baked in the sun in Abraham Lincoln's office for years before an enlightened Civil War soldier suggested closing the curtains. Scientists are now debating how to protect it. Over the years, Segars learned, many Presidents had different plans for guarding the country's precious documents. Segars pitched an idea to a friend at Disney for a modern-day Raiders of the Lost Ark involving a hunt for hidden national treasure. Soon, the movie was in development with director Jon Turtletaub. National Treasure which opens in the US on 24 November, is a Disney action adventure starring Nicolas Cage (above) as an historian who decides to steal the Declaration of Independence in order to find a map to hidden treasure on the back. Inevitably, Sean Bean is the heavy who's trying to steal it first.</p>",
  "<p>Beverley Turner has learnt to be pragmatic. She understands, she says, that her husband's career comes before his marriage. At least for the foreseeable future. Every morning he leaves home before she's woken up. In four years they've had breakfast together fewer than 20 times. He puts in seven-day weeks; long weekend breaks spent with friends are unheard of. His job is an obsession. 'It's hard to be part of a team when your partner is part of another, stronger, bigger, more important team,' she says. 'They are selfish, focused, driven, single-minded.' They have a baby son, Croyde, but she calls herself 'a part-time single mum'. Her husband she describes as 'a parent by mobile, a text parent'. </p> <p>Two weeks later Beverley's husband stands, tanned, broad-shouldered, square-jawed, every inch the superhero, on a podium in Athens. James Cracknell - along with his team-mates, Matthew Pinsent, Ed Coode and Steve Williams - has just won an Olympic gold medal in the coxless fours rowing final. </p> <p>Before Athens, Beverley, who has her own career as a writer and broadcaster, had tried to explain how she felt about her husband's campaign to win a gold at the Olympics. God, yes, she desperately wanted him to succeed. For all those bitterly cold early morning starts in the middle of winter to have been worthwhile. Maybe, if the British team crossed the finishing line first, they would be able to pay off their mortgage. And yet she worried that victory would mean she would see less of him, not more. He had separated from his previous girlfriend after winning gold at the 2000 Sydney Games. He blamed the break-up on how much busier he was after the championships than before. Only three of Britain's 13 rowing gold-medal winners from the Sydney squad were with the same partners four years later, Turner told me. 'What happens won't make any difference to the way I feel about him. But I know that whether he wins or loses it will affect the next 25 years.' </p> <p>'Footie totty, 'tennis babes', 'brolly dollies' - these cliched images of women for whom the biggest decision of the day is a leg wax or a manicure still persist. When hyperbolic sports commentators raid their thesaurus for words such as 'sacrifice' and 'dedication', they are rarely referring to the long-suffering partner on the sidelines or the lonely children back at home. Yet the reality is that marriage and family life in sport is increasingly under intolerable pressure and the traditional image of the sporting wife who has infinitely more handbags than brains is no longer accurate. No wonder that while the national divorce rate is high - around 40 per cent - within professional sport relationships it's 70 per cent. </p> <p>The sports pages have been transformed into agony columns. Cricketer Graham Thorpe dramatically blamed his loss of form and refusal to go on several winter tours on his failing marriage. 'I am worn down and burnt out,' he said. 'Events off the field have prevented me from focusing.' His wife, Nicky, said: 'To be a real dad you have to be there to put them to bed and take them to school.' His fellow England and Surrey batsman Mark Butcher also blamed a run of poor performances on problems at home. </p> <p>In April, Scottish golfer - and hero of this year's Ryder Cup - Colin Montgomerie finally split up from his childhood sweetheart, Eimear. She said she was exhausted by Montgomerie's extreme self-absorption and unpredictable moods. In a 'quickie divorce' settlement she cited her ex's 'unreasonable behaviour' as grounds (he was so competitive his children would let him win at snakes and ladders). Montgomerie himself has talked frankly about his obsessive behaviour wrecking his marriage. In a well publicised crisis four years before they finally parted for good, he moved into a hotel and spent his days wandering around Harrods and his nights trawling London's empty streets. 'To say that I was shattered is an understatement,' he said at the time. 'I felt that everything I had achieved just fell through the floor. I cried a lot. I felt a failure.' </p> <p>Another golfer, Nick Faldo, was so self-absorbed he persuaded his (now ex-) wife Gill to have three induced births to fit in with his tour schedule. She has since said: 'In my heart I would have loved to have a had a natural birth, but at the time it was a mutual decision. I did sometimes wonder what it would take for Nick to pull out of a tournament for someone else's sake.' </p> <p>More recently, David Beckham's ill-judged penalties at Euro 2004 were blamed on turmoil at home: either his wife, Victoria Beckham, and her decision not to give up her career to uproot to Spain, or his text 'n' tell former public relations assistant, Rebecca Loos. Tour de France cyclist Lance Armstrong dedicated his autobiography to his wife - 'To Kik, for completing me as a man'. Five years, three children later they divorced and it was rock singer Sheryl Crow who cheered him on to a record-breaking sixth win in July. (To make sure that she doesn't feel left out of his career, he's thoughtfully bought her a bike.) </p> <p>George Best, Faldo, Wayne Rooney, Boris Becker, Frank Bruno, Paul Gascoigne (not to mention a certain Swedish football coach and the suits at the Football Association) - our male sports stars have started to make the British royal family look like Relate counsellors. Sportswomen, meanwhile, are far less likely to let their love lives interfere with their training routine. They either remain single and childless, choosing to settle down after their career is over, or their partners become their coaches and mentors, as with Paula Radcliffe's husband Gary Lough. If there is another man mentioned it's more likely to be a rather older one - the father. </p> <p>Cricket and golf have the worst reputations for unhappy relationships and broken families. Seasoned commentators blame long tours and endemic sexism - neither likely to be chapter headings in Ten Steps to a Good Marriage . 'In golf, women are seen as second-class citizens,' one golfing writer told me. 'From the clubhouse up. They're either Barbie dolls or Eves, destroying a man's talent.' Meanwhile, cricket's image has yet to be feminised in any way. Even Wisden recently ran a piece by ex-player Derek Pringle entitled 'Don't marry a cricketer'. </p> <p>These days, though, few sports are immune. There's more pressure, longer tours, greater fame, increased column inches - for the players and their wives. Meanwhile, none of this is conducive to putting in the washing, taking out the rubbish, dropping off the kids at school, picking them up. While leading sportsmen are finding that the business they're in makes ever greater demands on them, their partners are too. </p> <p>Karen Parlour won a landmark divorce settlement case in June against her ex-husband Ray, the long-time Arsenal midfielder who has now joined Middlesbrough. As the case unfolded, it proved to have three of the classic ingredients of a modern sporting marriage. First, a childhood romance gone sour; professional sportsmen, often from close-knit stable backgrounds, are frequently initially attracted by the idea of settling down. Second, addiction; like many professional footballers, success had come hand in hand for Ray with an alcohol and gambling problem. Karen's lawyers argued that she had been instrumental in helping him recover, in his early career, from problems with drinking and betting. Without her support he would never had thrived under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Arsenal. Third, the other woman; one morning Ray phoned Karen to announce that he was leaving her and their three children for a new girlfriend. </p> <p>Karen Parlour's divorce settlement included \u00a31.8million of Ray's future earnings. It was clear whose side the Sun was on - the one-word front-page headline the following day read: 'Fleeced'. Maggie Rae, Karen Parlour's solicitor at Clintons, a law firm that handles many high-profile sporting divorces from tennis to horse racing, argues Karen's side of the story. 'A sporting marriage can be overwhelming. It takes over everything. Like diplomats' wives they are subsumed by their husband's careers. Meanwhile, the real high-earning days are limited. They have all this responsibility and pressure without any of the security. A company wife would feel much more secure and at the same time wouldn't have the nail-biting pressure of a victory or a loss to deal with, on a day to day basis.' </p> <p>She continues: 'The club ethos doesn't help. The club is often more important than the marriage. The wife will have spent years feeling excluded from that club mentality. Many women have no idea what it's like to be married to a professional sportsman until it's too late. They convince themselves they'll be the ones to make it work.' </p> <p>In many respects a sporting partner in 2004 has more in common with Fifties-style Stepford Wives than Footballers' Wives. Even the clothes are a kind of uniform; it just happens to be Gucci, not gingham. Pictures of the wives and girlfriends (or Wags as the FA's acronym calls them) of the Euro 2004 England team, or of the wives and girlfriends of the 1999 US Ryder Cup team, for instance, show a classic feminine look where every woman is tanned, polished, thin. The majority don't work but, however rich they may be, neither do they employ childminders or nannies. Even Victoria Beckham stresses how much childcare she does. </p> <p>The focus of the marriage is seen to be on the husband and his career while the wife plays the role of the quiet, loyal supporter. She is not allowed to complain or to step out of line. If she does - such as Posh Spice's decision not to move to Madrid - she's criticised or ostracised (witness the glee when Mrs Beckham missed the boat on booking into the same hotel as the other Wags in Portugal because it was full). Meanwhile, in a world where most of the management, the fans and the journalists are male, she must develop a coating tougher than any Chanel nail varnish if her partner starts to underperform. Tiger Woods's girlfriend, part-time Swedish model Elin Nordegren, has been blamed for his run of bad performances. It's conveniently forgotten that he had a girlfriend when he was doing well, too. </p> <p>Steven Ortiz, an assistant professor of sociology at Oregon State University, has researched sport marriages for 10 years. He interviewed many sporting wives and partners and gradually infiltrated an often secretive inner circle. 'We know a great deal about high-profile husbands. In contrast, we know very little about the almost invisible wives. These are husband-orientated, career-dominated marriages,' he says, 'set in a hyper-masculine world. They have something of the army marriage or the corporate marriage - but more so. Wives have second-class status.' </p> <p>Ortiz, who is writing a book about sporting marriages, receives emails from women saying: 'Look, I've met this great guy but he's a professional basketball player. Do you think it's a good idea?' He avoids answering by saying he's 'an academic, not a therapist' but one suspects he would suggest they run a personal best - in the opposite direction. </p> <p>He describes a world where wives are suspicious of outsiders, where they often feel betrayed by husbands who are unfaithful, by managers who have the power to cut off the money supply, by supporters who shout insults in the street. Contrary to the stereotype of the gold-digging groupie, many women marry young, never really believing their partners will actually become famous. </p> <p>Life with a sporting partner is one of extremes, both emotionally and financially. There's the adrenaline rush of a win ... or the crashing disappointment of defeat. A player can be bought for record-breaking amounts of money one season, be dropped or injured the next. Mothers have the pressure of looking after children single-handed, followed by the change of dynamic in the household when the sportsman finally returns from a tour. As Ortiz says: 'Sporting wives are used to coping with the kind of stress other women would find unbelievable.' </p> <p>He describes husbands who have been hero-worshipped since they were boys by their parents - 'sport mothers are worse than stage mothers'. Marriages where 'the wife provides emotional support for her husband but his support for her is minimal, particularly during the season. His often self-absorbed pursuit of his career leaves her feeling neglected, unappreciated and abandoned.' </p> <p>There is, he has discovered, an unwritten set of rules which wives must abide by. One of his interviewees talks about the importance of keeping up a united front: 'Never do anything in public to reflect on his image or that of the team. I've learnt to grin and bear it. Suppress and smile. Like a politician's wife.' So much so, she explains, if her husband is injured and she's in the stands she maintains her composure. 'Be stoic. Don't show that you're worried.' </p> <p>Another wife, Martha, outlines rule number two. 'You're like a kid. Seen and not heard.' Ortiz's interviewees even describe sitting separately from their husbands on the tour bus and thinking twice before joining in the banter. Rules three and four are 'Get along with the other wives' and 'What happens on the tour, stays on the tour'. In other words, a conspiracy of silence builds up. 'Wives become the unwilling keepers of the \"clubhouse secrets\" by not revealing what they see on the road.' </p> <p>He describes a culture where sleeping around is a sign of manliness: 'Male infidelity is tolerated ... even encouraged. The team claims for itself the loyalty of the husband as a \"real man\" or \"one of us\".' The global multimillion-pound business of sport means that our sports heroes are treated more like pop singers with magazine front covers, commercials, fashion shoots, appearances on chat shows. The result is that almost every sport with the possible exception of darts has its groupies and affairs. </p> <p>Some British footballers, for example, have become better known for their antics off the pitch than on. Yet while two new verbs - 'roasting' and 'dogging' - have slunk into the language, it's not only footballers who are playing away. There's the world-class golfer who gets his PA to find an available woman at every hotel; the married cricketer with four mobile phones, one for each girlfriend; the tennis star's baby conceived in a restaurant cloakroom. Rumours abound. What's more surprising, perhaps, is that many wives know exactly what is happening but choose to keep quiet about it. </p> <p>I first met Suzi Walker mid-Nineties when she featured in a Channel 4 Cutting Edge documentary about footballers' wives. A former model, she had been married to her husband, the then Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, for two years. She was everything one imagined a footballer's wife might be - blonde, blue-eyed, bosomy and as bubbly as a late-night cocktail at Stringfellows. </p> <p>Eight years on it's a different story. Over a difficult 12-month period around 1998, Ian's mother died, while Suzi had a life-threatening labour with their daughter, Sophie, and began to suffer from chronic ME. Tottenham gave Ian one week off following his daughter's birth, after which he was summoned back to work. Suzi plainly adores her husband - 'We have a strong marriage and I can 100 per cent trust him' - but there's a weariness in her voice that wasn't there when we met before. </p> <p>'We've had highs but lots of lows too. At one point it was a real struggle. Sophie wasn't sleeping, I'd barely come out of hospital. Plus Ian was getting over the death of his mum. It affected his football. He had a couple of dud games and they bumped him out of the team. I was really hurt by that. Ian had loved Spurs. So had I. But you come to realise there is no room to follow your heart. The football clubs are hard and you have to be too.' </p> <p>Ian is now at Leicester City. He stays in a hotel near the club three nights a week and travels back down to the family in-between. Meanwhile, Suzi's illness still flares up, exacerbated by stress (being married to a goalie can't help much). Plainly the Walker family are not bankrupt or homeless. Suzi talks about cutting back, but what she means is rationing the number of BMWs lined up in the driveway. On the other hand, it's clear that clubs do not see family life as a priority for their players and there is very little compassion if problems at home invade the pitch. 'No one said, \"Take a couple of weeks off to sort yourselves out\",' she recalls with some bitterness, 'which is what we desperately needed. Meanwhile fans would lash out at us when we were out. They didn't care that his mum had just died and his wife had been at death's door. I used to wake up in the morning and think this can't get any worse. Callous and mean - that's how football really is.' </p> <p>Ian is on a one-year contract with Leicester, relegated from the Premiership last season. At the end of the season, he doesn't know for whom or where he'll be playing. 'But he'll have to go where the money is. You can't put your feelings first. We've just got to get through it. You have to go where the offers are.' </p> <p>Children are treated with suspicion by coaches and managers. The received wisdom suggests that once children are on the scene a sportsman will lose his focus, his edge, his desire to win. Sport will no longer be the most important thing in his life. Earlier this year, the England cricket captain, Michael Vaughan, opted to attend the birth of his first baby, Tallulah Grace, rather than compete in a match against New Zealand. The decision - pretty much taken for granted outside sport - was greeted with surprise (traditionally, babies have been induced to fit in with all-important tour dates). The footballer Ledley King was similarly criticised when he returned home from Euro 2004 to be with his partner when she was about to give birth. </p> <p>Denise Fraser, the wife of former England cricketer Angus Fraser, is one of the few sporting wives to have spoken out about the way families are treated by their teams. She asked her husband if he would have followed Vaughan's example if he had still been playing (Angus remains on the cricket tour as a broadcaster and writer). 'Probably not,' he conceded. </p> <p>Back when he was playing, Angus counted the number of nights he had spent at home one year - it was fewer than 30 per cent. 'You are a single mum,' Denise says, echoing Beverley Turner. 'Even when the husbands are at home playing county cricket. Most of the responsibility is yours. Especially where discipline is concerned. You end up being the strict one. Meanwhile, the men either come home just wanting to have fun or are too exhausted even to pick the kids up.' </p> <p>Their son, Alexander, has complained in the past: 'Why can't dad have a normal job?' </p> <p>She has spoken out about the anti-wife attitude that she experienced in the Nineties. During one South Africa tour which the families were invited on, there weren't even enough seats on the airport bus for the wives and children. 'It was a fiasco,' she recalls. 'Once they're playing you're pretty much stranded. The girls would be left to get on with it.' </p> <p>When Angus had a difficult patch she would feel in the way. 'Any small domestic problem would escalate according to what he was going through. I remember he was dropped from one game and our son was ill at the same time. His reaction was \"I don't need you here\".' </p> <p>Does any of this matter - the long distances apart, relationships under pressure, children missing out on their fathers - if the sportsman performs on the pitch? Increasingly sport psychologists argue that there must be a balance between the professional and private. Certainly Colin Montgomerie, Graham Thorpe and Mark Butcher watched their form suffer when their personal lives collapsed. Andre Agassi, who is now married to Steffi Graf having been divorced from the actress Brooke Shields, has talked about the benefits of a good home life. 'Sex doesn't interfere with your tennis. It's staying out all night trying to find it that affects your tennis. Marriage is the best thing.' </p> <p>The markedly different private lives of the World Cup-winning England rugby team and the disappointing performance of the England football squad in Euro 2004 support the prevailing view. Sir Clive Woodward took much of the boorishness out of the rugby side. The often loutish, boozy image was replaced with players such as Jonny Wilkinson and Jason Robinson, who looked as though a dash of lime in their soda water was enough excitement for one night. </p> <p>Meanwhile, barely a week goes by without the England football team's messy private lives being exposed in the press, from Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's affair with Faria Alam to Sol Campbell's ex demanding a DNA test to prove he's the father of her baby, from Emile Heskey's affair with a lap dancer to revelations about Wayne Rooney visiting a massage parlour. </p> <p>Sports psychologist Carole Seheult works with young footballers who have recently signed up to professional teams. 'A good relationship is absolutely key,' she says. 'You can't be worrying all the time about what's going on at home. The dynamic of the personal relationship is crucial.' </p> <p>Research repeatedly shows that most men feel happier and healthier when they're married. Contrary to the popular image of the sporting playboy, it's possible that married sports men might crave that stability more than most. But, in the intense world of modern sport, stability can be elusive, certainly without an understanding coach in the background. While 'work/life balance' is the mantra for the rest of us in the workplace, sport is becoming more pressured, not less. Meanwhile, the 21st-century sporting wife is seeking a more equal relationship, too: a marriage of two halves. </p> <p>Beverly Turner and I speak again following her return from Athens. How does life look now? 'Exhausting,' she says. But it transpires that this has more to do with a week's partying after the Olympic rowing final than any early-morning starts. Now they're back home, James is spending time with the baby. 'We've even got two weddings to go to this weekend,' she says laughing. 'There was nothing I could do in the run-up to the Olympics. His life was dictated by the team and by the coach, and I had to fit around that.

  "<p>Imagine that you are cruising north along the M1 in your \u00a3170,000 Aston Martin Vanquish. You have just left the \u00a36 million home in Hampstead that you share with your wife - a beautiful model - to go to kick a ball about in the countryside with a group of fellow millionaires. You are a World Cup-winner, a European Championship-winner, you are a reigning Premiership champion, unbeaten throughout an entire season, and you are holder of both the Professional Footballers' Association and the Football Writers' player of the year awards (as you were the previous year, too). Oh, and you were last season's top scorer. On your journey, you pass a distractingly large billboard that features a 30-foot high poster of a man clasping the Premiership trophy in triumph. That man is you. </p> <p>Welcome to the perfect world of Thierry Henry, a footballer whom, if he didn't exist, not even a comic-book editor would dare to invent. If watching Henry play football is often an exercise in disbelief, then his good fortune off the pitch is no less a challenge to credibility. Lean, handsome, charismatic and inordinately gifted, he draws adoration from a fan base that is restricted to neither men nor sports fans. He is one of those rare individuals whose wealth and success no one begrudges. Indeed, his life appears so closely to resemble a capitalist fantasy that a Renault car commercial made a capitalist fantasy out of his life. </p> <p>All of which means that if you were Thierry Henry, you might think you would be as happy as the day is long. Well, perhaps he is, but not on this sleepy late summer's afternoon. The previous evening, Arsenal had broken Nottingham Forest's record for matches unbeaten in league football, securing maximum points from their first three games into the bargain. But Henry looks a long way from content. There is, when he sits down to talk to me in an empty studio next to Arsenal's London Colney training ground, no hint of that boyish half-smile with which he can charm referees and car buyers. No sparkle or zest. No va-va-voom. </p> <p>He carries himself with the combination of loose-limbed ease and muscular pride that is the mark of athletes at their peak. Il est bien dans sa peau, as the French say, but he doesn't make you feel too bien in yours. He talks in the style common to French footballers, that of the reluctant oracle: a medley of platitudes delivered in the tone of a bored philosopher rehashing timeless truths. He begins almost every answer with the chastening phrase, 'As I've said before...' </p> <p>It would be reasonable to assume, therefore, that my questioning is at fault. But afterwards I am told, apparently without irony, by the publicist for whom Henry is promoting Nike's new Vis Total 90 Aerow ball, which is to be used in the Premiership, that he has never seen him so animated in an interview. </p> <p>Sportsmen are not paid to give interviews. Except when they are, like Henry (who is contracted to The Sun), paid to give interviews. His real job, the only one that matters, is to score and make goals, and no one on the planet currently does it better. And this is all I want to learn from Henry: how did he get to be so good? How did he improve by so much? </p> <p>With very few exceptions, strikers tend to announce themselves with a youthful flourish, before fear and wised-up opponents get the better of them. They then either settle on to a plateau of sustainable performance or become, with the help of injuries, ghosts of their former selves. In England, Michael Owen would represent the first group and Robbie Fowler the second. But seldom do forwards, once they have reached their mid-twenties, get better and better. </p> <p>When Henry arrived in England from Juventus in the summer of 1999 as a replacement for his friend Nicolas Anelka, few people, other than Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, envisaged the footballer he would become. His brief spell in Italy, where he was used as a wide midfielder, had left him short of confidence and his early performances for Arsenal earned him the title of the French Perry Groves. </p> <p>Henry said when he arrived that he needed to 'rediscover the scoring instinct, that automatic reaction in front of goal'. After four difficult months in England he conceded: 'I've literally had to go back to school and be re-taught everything about the art of striking.' Five years later he is, as the former Arsenal and England striker Alan Smith puts it, 'incomparable'. </p> <p>Henry has been a professional for 10 years, having made his debut for Wenger's Monaco side in the mid-Nineties, and now, at 27, he is in his prime. It's important to remember that as long ago as 1998, while effectively a winger, he was France's top scorer in the World Cup and joint top scorer in Monaco's Champions League campaign. He's not, like Ruud van Nistelrooy, a late starter. Yet his all-round game, to say nothing of his goalscoring, has seen an exponential improvement since 1999. It is perhaps no coincidence that this period has been spent under the tutelage of Wenger, who first took hold of Henry as a gangly 16-year-old from a Paris overspill estate. </p> <p>When I ask Henry about his extraordinary improvement he shrugs dismissively, as if irritated, then says: 'So many people say that obviously my game has changed since I arrived here and I say that it's good that it changed, otherwise it would show a lack of intelligence. You learn from your mistakes. When I was younger I was trying to do what I wanted to do, not what the game wanted me to do. I would say that's the difference.' </p> <p>There can be no doubt that Henry, for all his moody looks and arrogant swagger, is a consummate team player. You have only to look at his record of assists and willingness to pass to players in better positions to see that. While he scored 30 goals in the Premiership last season, he was directly responsible for at least 20 more and he often lays on goals that require no more than a brush from a team-mate's toe to finish. </p> <p>Recently, the ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley said that he could not recall anyone playing with such composure at such speed. The nephew of a former French 400 metres champion, Henry has a sprinter's acceleration. But unlike most footballers with pace, he runs with the ball close to him and often with his head up. In the first few games of the season, he destroyed Middlesbrough and Norwich, launching the kind of attacks that make defenders look like cones in a practice session. He was also carrying an Achilles injury. 'At the moment, I'm not doing what I can do on the pitch,' he told me. 'I can't make the runs. I'm not match fit. I'm just concentrating on my passing and being available for the team.' Whether fit or unfit, Henry has established his physical superiority in such a consistent manner as to gain him a distinct psychological advantage. In this sense, he is able to beat his man even before he goes past him. I wondered how much his sense of what he was capable of doing had grown over the years, if he was aware that he intimidated opponents. </p> <p>'Well,' he replies, 'Youri Djorkaeff used to say when we played at Monaco that he could sense that I might be a great player, but that he didn't feel that when I had the ball it was my ball. But, at the moment, when I step on the pitch, when I have the ball I know it's mine. It's just a feeling. Some players you know when they have the ball that something is going to happen.' </p> <p>He started to feel this way around four years ago, when Arsenal reached the final of the Uefa Cup and France won Euro 2000. But most observers would say that the great leap forward came in the 2002-03 season and was followed by another last term. Earlier this year, he said: 'Now I know that whenever I feel that the time has come for me to make a difference in our games, I can and I will.' </p> <p>'I saw him play against Liverpool about three seasons ago,' says Smith. 'He terrorised them. Afterwards, I spoke to a number of pros and they all said they hadn't seen anything like it. On his day, he had become unplayable, and more and more since then it has been his day. I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best.' </p> <p>One of the striking aspects of Arsenal's slick passing football is that the team does not contain a playmaker or midfield maestro. There is, for instance, no Zinedine Zidane. Why slow the ball down in the centre of the park when you have Henry to unleash up front? No team has ever gone from box to box with the speed and precision of Arsenal. That's why they are often at their most dangerous when defending a corner. </p> <p>That all their operations in recent years have been conducted through Zidane might explain why the France side has yet to see the very best of Henry. There were rumours in Portugal of disagreements in the dressing room between the Arsenal players and those grouped around Zidane. That Henry has said he thought of retiring himself after the tournament may suggest it was not an entirely pleasing experience. 'Well, as I said to everyone,' he tells me when I ask about his disappointment in Portugal, 'and everyone thought I was mad at the time, when we played against all the teams at the Euro, they were all sitting at the back waiting for us. The Greeks did the same thing to us as they did to the Czechs and Portugal, winning 1-0. Fair enough to Greece, but I was just saying if you play against a team that don't allow you to play football, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying sometimes it's not easy.' </p> <p>Yet Arsenal have not had too much trouble breaking down sides that defend deep. Henry refuses this bait. Instead, he makes the bizarre suggestion that it is more important for teams to attempt to win in the Premiership than it is in international competitions. And therefore the opposition open up against Arsenal in a way they don't against France. Whatever the explanation, there was a suspicion that Henry was playing in Zidane's shadow for France, while in England opponents were left looking at Henry's shadow. In the event, it was Zidane, voted World Footballer of the Year in 2003, who retired in the summer from international football, not Henry, who came second in the same Fifa poll. The king is dead, long live the king. </p> <p>Les Ulis, the suburb in Paris in which Henry grew up, is often described as a tough environment, full of the kind of social problems that can make or break a young man, what's known in France as les quartiers difficiles. To be sure, it's nothing like the postcard Paris of grand avenues and elegant cafes, but nor is it anywhere near as bleak as its English equivalents. A dormitory town just to the south of the capital, not far from Orly airport, it is made up of social housing built in the Sixties that, by comparison with the average English new town, looks almost resplendent. Most impressive of all is the sports arena, containing two excellent football pitches (one junior size) and a running track. How many British towns with a population of under 30,000 have these kinds of facilities? It was here that the 11-year-old Thierry Henry played for his first team, Les Ulis. His coach was a vaguely Hercule Poirot-looking character named Claude Chezelle. </p> <p>I meet Chezelle outside the breeze block apartments in which Henry used to live. He says that even at the age of eight, Henry stood out with his vitesse. Henry had an older brother, Willy, now a metro driver in Paris, who played football for a separate team for blacks and Arabs. Born into a more enlightened generation, Henry also had the benefit of a very determined father. </p> <p>Antoine Henry, who came from Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, told Chezelle that his son would play for France. 'It is hard for kids to concentrate and Thierry was no different,' Antoine admitted. 'Perhaps I was a bit suffocating for him, but I felt I had to keep on top of him. I was so determined he should get the best chance I lost a job over it. I missed the start of a shift as a security guard after driving Thierry to a game and was fired when I turned up two hours late.' </p> <p>Chezelle remembers how Antoine would 'come to every game to watch his son. Thierry had the talent, but it was his father who had the ambition.' Henry has echoed this point himself: 'To say that my dad pushed me is an understatement. I was never naturally drawn to football.' There were a number of young Africans in the junior leagues around Paris and, because some of them did not have birth certificates, clubs would sometimes put them in younger teams. 'Thierry used to play against giants who would try to rough him up,' his father recalled a few years ago. 'It was just this kind of situation that proved to me one day that Thierry had the balls, as we say, to reach the top.' </p> <p>On one occasion when Henry was injured playing for a nearby team called US Palaiseau, his father rushed on to the pitch to remonstrate with a referee. A fist-fight ensued and the match was abandoned. Such was the tension between Palaiseau and Antoine that Henry left to join another club, Viry-Chatillon. Unusually, the Palaiseau coach, Jean-Marie Panza, left to go with him. Henry has never forgotten that loyalty and not long ago named Panza as his mentor in L'Equipe magazine. </p> <p>Chezelle shows me a photograph taken around 1986, when Henry was nine. He has a mini-afro and the familiar ironic-angelic expression that Chezelle says he inherited from his mother, Maryse, a native of Martinique. 'He also had the same way of side-footing the ball into the net that he has now,' says Chezelle. 'When I watch him on TV it's just like seeing the grown-up version of the boy.' </p> <p>According to Antoine Henry, Thierry picked up his precision shooting from watching Marco van Basten, who was his hero. It was while playing for Viry-Chatillon that the 13-year-old Henry was spotted by a scout for Monaco called Arnold Catalano. He saw the teenager score all six goals in a 6-0 victory and did not bother with the normal procedure of setting up a trial. He pretty much signed him up on the spot. </p> <p>'Thierry has never been the prototype of the player who sticks in the box to score goals,' said Catalano a while back. 'He is so hard to block because he participates in the game before finding himself the space to score. The ball is alive when Arsenal are playing and you can see Thierry takes a lot of pleasure from the technique and movement of the players around him.' </p> <p>The pace and composure in front of goal were always there but, as Catalano had it, 'he wasn't one for trying too hard if he couldn't see the point'. It was Wenger who was responsible for instilling what Catalano called 'professional grit'. </p> <p>Before making his debut with Monaco as a 17-year-old, Henry completed a course at Clairefontaine, France's renowned national football school. Claude Desseau, the director of the Institute National de Football, recalled that Henry had problems getting on the course because of poor school results. 'We really had to convince the college principal to take him because he was such a super player. He finally agreed to make a rare exception for Thierry. And, happily, Thierry got more serious about that side of things and went on to do very well with his education.' </p> <p>Also at Clairefontaine, a year below Henry, was Anelka, Henry's predecessor at Highbury. Though Desseau thought Henry an exceptional prospect, he considered Anelka to have the edge on talent - as indeed, apparently, did Anelka himself. Anelka and Henry have remained friends, but you could hardly say that they were now rivals. Henry is set on doing something that only the most dedicated athletes are capable of. In contrast to Anelka, he is fulfilling his potential. </p> <p>'I'm obsessed by the idea of making my mark on history,' he said last year. 'And Arsenal is my paradise.' His sense of history may have been shaped by watching it made at frustratingly close quarters. Though he was France's top scorer in the 1998 World Cup, he did not play in the final itself. He was due to come on five minutes after half-time, but Marcel Desailly was sent off, so he got no closer than the bench. </p> <p>His fidelity to his club - he remains unmoved by the approaches made by Real Madrid and Chelsea, who were said to have offered \u00a340million - may stem, in part, from the lessons he learnt as a restless youth. He said he was dazzled by the lifestyle he encountered on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. 'Big boats everywhere, big cars, beautiful women, the sun, the sea, the famous people. Life could seem easy in a place like this and, even as a kid, I thought, \"This might not be the best place to learn football\".' </p> <p>While still under contract to Monaco in 1996 and still a teenager, Henry was persuaded by his agents to sign an agreement with Real Madrid. However, Fifa insisted that he stay with the French club and later fined him \u00a340,000. Two years later he moved to Juventus and, like his Arsenal team-mates Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp, found himself strangled by Italian defensive discipline. Legend has it that Wenger was on the same plane as Henry one evening in 1999, flying back to France after a game in Italy. 'Thierry,' he is supposed to have said, 'you are wasting your time on the wing. You are a number nine.' </p> <p>In turn, Henry asked his old boss to rescue his stalled career. He had been relegated to the France under-21 side and questions were being asked about his mental strength. It is unlikely that Wenger's travel arrangements that night were purely coincidental. </p> <p>It was in fact Wenger, whom Henry has referred to as his 'spiritual father', who originally put him on the wing at Monaco as a temporary measure because the Brazilian striker Sonny Anderson was leading the line. And it was Wenger who brought him back into the centre, if you can really say that Henry plays in the centre. Though he has developed a good deal of physical, as well as mental, strength at Arsenal and is more than capable of holding the ball up, he is by no means a target man. 'He has intelligence and ambition,' Wenger has said. 'When you put those two things together, you have a player who wants to improve. He will get better because he wants to get better.' </p> <p>You can see the intelligence in the awareness he shows of the space around him. Perhaps it was this talent that led him to forsake the mock-Tudor attractions of Hertfordshire, the traditional home of north London footballers, for the more cosmopolitan environs of Hampstead, where he lives with his wife, Claire, better known as the model Nicole Merry. 'Yeah,' he laughs, the one moment of amusement he allows himself. 'I was close to [moving to Hertfordshire] but luckily a friend saved me from it. It happened that I was going to live not far from there and it didn't go through with the house, lucky for me. Then a friend of mine said that the place to live was Hampstead. It would have been a nightmare driving into London all the time.' </p> <p>I mention that his team-mates and countrymen Vieira and Robert Pires live nearby in the cafe-filled hill-village that is Hampstead. 'Yeah, they do,' he says dryly, 'but I see them often during the day. That's enough.' </p> <p>Viera, of course, was on the point of leaving Highbury for Real Madrid at the start of this season. Surely that would have provoked a visit to his house to talk him out of the move? 'Well to be honest,' he says, returning to the script, 'it was a decision between him and the club. We had to concentrate on the beginning of the season, which was tricky because you don't know if you're going to lose your skipper. But he made the right decision. I'm sure he doesn't regret that now that he can see the way that we can play. Obviously, if he had left it would have been a massive disappointment but I think the team spirit helped him make the right choice.' </p> <p>That Arsenal have retained their celebrated team spirit is a surprise when you consider that it is a multinational squad with seldom more than two Englishmen in the team. The club of Adams, Dixon, Keown and Parlour, the team imbued with the will to win, or more often not to lose, is no longer. 'Obviously it did change when they left,' says Henry of his former English team-mates. 'They are proper characters and great winners, but in another way they showed us the way to build... I'm sure it wasn't easy for the fans. Obviously we do not have a lot of English players any more, but, in the end, we're all wearing the Arsenal shirt. I may be French, but I'm playing for Arsenal.' </p> <p>We talk a bit about the season ahead. He concedes that United and Chelsea are the main rivals, but thinks Liverpool look good. Then, in a moment of neighbourly generosity that may surprise some of the more entrenched sections of north London, he says: 'Why not Spurs?' </p> <p>United and Chelsea were the only English teams to beat proper Arsenal sides last year in, respectively, the FA Cup semi-final and the Champions League quarter-final. The defeats still irk Henry and he is at pains to point out that Arsenal had to play Newcastle, United, Chelsea and Liverpool in the space of eight days. Of the United game, he says: 'They beat us, fair enough, nothing to say about it, but I don't know if you remember the game, we had all the chances. They had one and they took it.' </p> <p>With Chelsea he is a little more forthcoming in his praise. 'I think Chelsea played a magnificent game [in the 2-1 win at Highbury]. We had a couple of chances, then in the second half they played better than us.' </p> <p>I ask Henry if he ever watches himself and he says: 'No,' but he pauses and decides to admit the exception. 'The only game I watched was Inter Milan away, because it was special. I don't know, it was just a strange feeling. We had to win there and at the time we were not even thinking about the goal difference. And we won 5-1.' </p> <p>Henry scored two that night and contributed as close to a perfect performance as is possible outside of REM sleep. It must have been particularly gratifying to have done so in Italy, where he had been deemed a failure, in the impatient Italian style, in less than a season. They know differently now. </p> <p>His brother Willy said a couple of months ago that Henry has remained grounded, despite his superstar status and extreme wealth, and still visits him at home near Les Ulis. 'He sleeps in the same room with me at the house or on the settee without any bother. We talk about anything and everything, but never football.' </p> <p>It's a shame, then, that Henry seems so eager, when we meet, to put on a cool front, because he's cooler than that. For there is nothing as impressive as a man who takes his craft seriously and masters it, except one who manages into the bargain not to take himself too seriously. </p> <p>When Henry started at Arsenal he said that it was his duty to adapt to life in this country. He learnt English almost as quickly as he runs and he learnt how to take the knocks and get up again. He learnt to appreciate the passion of the supporters, and the importance of team spirit. But we learned something, too. We discovered what it was like to see the very best each week. </p> <p>This year if Arsenal can win the Champions League, or at least make it to the final, and if Henry can maintain the sort of form that he's shown in the past couple of years, it is a near certainty that he will become Fifa's world footballer of the year. It would be no more than he deserves. Because right now this is Henry's world.

  "<p>If football clubs imposed a \u00a33 levy on every ticket they sold in order to hand the cash directly to agents, fans would surely rebel. Yet Manchester United and others are already doing just that. </p> <p>We know this because United, to their credit, last week betrayed one of the secrets of football's often murky finances by admitting they paid agents a total of \u00a35.5 million during 2003-04. That whopping sum comprised commissions for bringing new players to Old Trafford, among them Cristiano Ronaldo and Gabriel Heinze, and payments for helping to keep others there. </p> <p>Consider the figures. About 1.675 million spectators attended the 25 matches at Old Trafford last season. That works out at roughly \u00a33 per punter per game ending up with the likes of Pini Zahavi and Paul Stretford. </p> <p>United point out that matchday income accounts for only 36 per cent of their turnover, which would make the fans' contribution \u00a31 per head per game. Either way, United's openness in announcing the payments has made agents one of the talking points of the past week. </p> <p>The debate will go on following comments made to The Observer by a top agent yesterday. 'There is serious, serious corruption in football here,' said Colin Gordon, who represents top players in the Premiership and the Middlesbrough manager, Steve McClaren. The worst offences, he added, were in transfers from abroad. </p> <p>'If you picked any 20 foreign transfers, you'd find that a large proportion of them would involve over-priced players and money that's gone missing. But who's going to stop that? </p> <p>'Football clubs and chairmen know who in the game is corrupt, so why do they still use them? I would question the motives of a large number of managers, chief executives and chairmen in the game.' </p> <p>United have been criticised for forking out such large sums. Alan Smith's agent got \u00a3750,000 for arranging a straightforward \u00a36m transfer that the player, the selling club and the buying club all wanted to happen. Rodger Linse, Ruud van Nistelrooy's representative, was paid \u00a3331,000 of the \u00a31.2m he is due for negotiating an extension to the striker's contract. </p> <p>On top of that \u00a35.5m, last year United also agreed to pay \u00a31.5m to Stretford, Wayne Rooney's agent, for bringing the player from Everton. That works out at \u00a35,000 a week for the 312 weeks of the teenager's contract. However staggering United's figures and practices appear, consider the situation at Chelsea. After Roman Abramovich took over in July 2003, his friend Pini Zahavi, who is widely regarded as the world's best-connected, and richest, agent, played a key role in the series of big-name, big-money signings that followed. The Israeli, like Linse a former football journalist, pocketed somewhere between \u00a35m and \u00a310m for his work. At least \u00a35m from one club in the same period that United forked out \u00a35.5m to 10 agents representing 16 different players. </p> <p>Chelsea do not reveal how much Zahavi was paid. The Fifa guideline is five per cent commission on transfer fees, and with Chelsea spending \u00a3100m it was at least \u00a35m. </p> <p>'I suspect it's into double figures [of millions],' says one club boss who has dealt with Zahavi in recent years. Another senior figure adds: 'Pini pulled in at least the thick end of \u00a36m from Chelsea last year, and probably a bit more.' </p> <p>Given the usual secrecy that surrounds agents and transfers, and the growing concern in the game about bungs, overseas bank accounts and the likelihood that some managers and chairmen, as well as some agents, are on the take, English football's three governing bodies are all taking steps to tackle what some perceive as widespread covert corruption. </p> <p>The 72 Football League clubs have already published the first set of figures showing how much they paid in agents fees last year, and will do the same every season. Five weeks ago the 20 Premier League outfits agreed that their annual Directors' Reports will include details of payments to agents and third parties, and report to the league all deals in which more than \u00a325,000 is paid to any agent. </p> <p>The Football Association are drawing up some new regulations to help bolster the rules of Fifa, football's global authority, that supposedly govern agents' activities. The FA's moves are intended to ensure disclosure of both 'secondary payments' - the sums that end up with other agents or persons unknown who help to make a transfer happen - and relevant relationships between agents and managers, chairmen and chief executives. That should, for example, reveal how many managers hold shares in a football agency such as Proactive, and therefore stand to benefit financially by buying or selling a player - a clear potential conflict of interest. </p> <p>But there is bad news. Even the FA admit privately that agents' activities and rewards are so hard to police that improvements may have little effect. They still rely on agents voluntarily disclosing information. </p> <p>Gordon, whose clients include David James and Chris Kirkland, says: 'It's impossible to have a system that has full integrity or disclosure because, for instance, neither the FA nor the Inland Revenue can compel a foreign club to open its books to see where money they received from a club here ended up.' </p> <p>Fifa show little interest in tackling excesses and broken rules, and have not disciplined any of the agents reported by the FA for misdemeanours. </p> <p>United have introduced an overdue measure of transparency, but the serious action needed to regulate how agents operate is not on the horizon. </p> <p>No wonder, then, that someone like Gordon concludes despairingly: 'Agents get a terrible name but the main problem isn't fees to agents, it's transfer fees. That's where the serious wrongdoing goes on.'</p>",

Denmark's Thomas Bjorn is second on 13 under, while Ireland's Padraig Harrington, David Howell and Open Champion Todd Hamilton are tied for third place on 12 under. </p> <p>That Els has not won a major championship this year is hard to fathom. The South African has performed better than any player in the four tournaments that count, but somehow he has not managed to get his hands on any of them. </p> <p>Els missed out at the Masters by a shot to Phil Mickelson and was in contention in the US Open after three rounds only to shoot a final-round 80 in the ridiculous conditions set by the United States Golf Association at Shinnecock Hills. </p> <p>He missed a putt to win the Open Championship on the final green, and lost in a playoff to Hamilton. Then he three putted the final green in the USPGA Championship to miss out on a play-off. </p> <p>The damage to Els' psyche was so severe he has just returned from a two-week break during which he did not touch a golf club. He has returned ready to rededicate himself to the game. </p> <p>'There's a lot for me to play for and I want to give it a good go,' said Els. 'If you take your eye off the ball for too long, the competition is so fierce that you can get left behind. I'm ready to start climbing the hill again.' </p> <p>Els has been at his imperious best this week. He fired a best-round-of-the-week 64, eight-under-par, on Friday to take the lead, and yesterday added to that with five birdies and just one dropped shot. </p> <p>Bjorn is another player who has had to heal a damaged ego this season. </p> <p>He walked off the golf course the last time he played in Ireland, giving up after seven holes of the Smurfit European Open in July, talking about demons inside his head. The Dane said acting as assistant Ryder Cup captain to Bernhard Langer at Oakland Hills had changed his outlook on the game. </p> <p>'A month ago I would stand on a fairway with a 7-iron and wonder how I was going to get the ball on the green,' Bjorn said. 'Now all I can see is the flag. </p> <p>'If you had asked me last week if I would be lying second to Ernie Els I would have said no way.' </p> <p>Such is Bjorn's confidence that he gave an emphatic 'yes' when asked if he thought he could win the title today. </p> <p>The weight of expectation is firmly on Harrington's shoulders - all of Ireland want the Dubliner to win. He is cognisant of the pressure he is under, especially considering his only professional success in Ireland comes in the shape of two Irish PGA Championships, a minor event consisting of mainly Irish club professionals. </p> <p>'All the Irish supporters want you to win and somehow that translates into expectations,' said Harrington. 'You have to try and get away from those expectations because it's dangerous when you feel the pressure of expectations. </p> <p>'It's a big deal for me if I could go on and win, but, to be honest, I have to leave all those things until after it's finished.' </p> <p>Tiger Woods also turned up in Ireland with considerable weight of expectation on his shoulders. He has dominated these World Golf Championships since their inception, winning eight of the first 15. </p> <p>Moreover, he was looking for his third successive win in this tournament, but a bad back scuppered Woods' chances of that happening. He is seven shots off the pace on eight under par. Even more depressing for the world number one is that he looks set to end the season without a stroke play victory for the first year in his career. </p> <p>Woods won the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship in February. It remains his only win this season. </p> <p>Maybe he needs to have a chat with Els, Bjorn and Harrington about not living up to expectations. Who'd have thought that line would be used a few years ago?</p>",
  "Will Hutton's argument that declining birth rate in Europe puts 'our very civilisation under threat' ('An Italian lesson for Europe', Comment, last week) considers only economic issues and does not consider ecology. A lower population means less pollution and depletion of natural resources. In capitalist societies it is enormously difficult to reduce pollution and depletion per head: it is vital to reduce population as rapidly as possible. The increased tensions in cross-generation income transfers are far outweighed by the ecological gains. The only unambiguous loser is business since it expands by expanding its workforce. Hutton argues that the declining birth rate makes 'optimism ... run dry'. A more rational view would see it as one of our few reasons to be optimistic. <br> <b>Jamie Gough</b> <br> Newcastle upon Tyne <p>I was saddened to see Will Hutton supporting increasing the birth rate in Britain and in other countries. </p> <p>His case, and the government's, as reported by Robin McKie, is that in order to retain a balance of age classes and help continue our profligate life style in the West, we need more babies. This mirrors a similar mantra for more roads, more energy production, more houses. And so it goes on. </p> <p>We are a grossly overpopulated country in a grossly overpopulated world. If we want a future, what we should surely do is take stock, calculate the basic resources available - such as raw materials, space, land and water - and then see how many people these will support living the lifestyles they should be able to expect? </p> <p>Such a calculation also cannot assume current resource distribution. If only through the self-interest of achieving global stability, there must be a fairer distribution of wealth and resources in this country and between countries. This will simply not be achievable by increasing everyone's standards to the highest, even in the unlikely event of those currently at the top of the pile letting others catch up. </p> <p>We clearly have to address the issue of how to deal with the transition from current to future birth rates but let's welcome a drop in population in this country and globally so that some of the major problems facing mankind can at least be better addressed. </p> <p>Pie in the sky? Of course, but oh for a few politicians to start taking a longer-term view of what is required.<br> <b>Dr Peter Tilbrook</b><br> Rosenberg<br> Cromarty<br> Ross-shire<br> </p> <p>For years, people have complained there are too many (other) people in the world. Now we panic about the effects on the young population of falling birth rates, fast food, cheap booze, fags and recreational drugs. At the same time we fret about the pensions crisis. </p> <p>Perhaps the solution is simple. Junk food, fags, booze, fast cars, dangerous sports and unsafe sex should be banned (or rationed) until retirement. After that they should be compulsory.<br> <b>Iain Climie</b> <br> Whitchurch<br> Hants<br></p>",
  "<p>You probably hadn't realised that the world's fifth-largest finance centre was blown to smithereens last month. But discretion is a way of life for Grand Cayman, which ranks behind only New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong in the enormity of its bank deposits. This tiny island in the Caribbean doesn't like to draw attention to itself - even when Hurricane Ivan comes calling. </p> <p>Winds of 150 miles per hour buffeted the Cayman Islands on 13 September, leaving the British dependent territory without electricity, telephones or running water for days, and wreaking a path of devastation that left large areas flooded and up to half of all dwellings uninhabitable. Early evening curfews were imposed as angry residents complained that the authorities were playing down the scale of the disaster in an attempt to reassure international investors. </p> <p>Cayman - whose 45,000 residents are outnumbered by the number of brass-plate companies registered there - has certainly been quick to allay fears that its shattered infrastructure could disrupt the all-important finance industry. </p> <p>Emphasising that the sector's assets - 'pretty much electronic money' - were intact and sustained by backup computer servers, Eduardo Silva, president of the Cayman Bankers Association, insisted all would soon be back to normal. 'The message is, the island is open for business, though not 100 per cent.' </p> <p>Even so, Silva was one of many to take refuge in nearby Florida shortly before the hurricane hit. </p> <p>And Grand Cayman has more to worry about than the weather. John Kerry, Democrat challenger in this year's US presidential race, has blamed the island for America's tax evasion problem, and Cayman's lucrative status as the world's leading offshore tax haven is under threat. </p> <p>That status has been hard won. Cayman, a self-governing territory, first began to develop its offshore industry in the Sixties, when - like Jersey, Bermuda, and Gibraltar - it was encouraged by London to find new ways of becoming self-sufficient. Taxes were set at virtually zero, and disclosure requirements were minimal: in effect, companies and bank accounts could be owned anonymously. </p> <p>Such a regime inevitably lent itself to large numbers of embarrassing frauds. BCCI's international arm had its headquarters in Grand Cayman, far from the prying eyes of robust investigators, and Enron used 'special purpose entities' on the island to hide its massive debts. Cayman was even the setting for sinister goings-on in John Grisham's financial thriller The Firm. </p> <p>The island's authorities do not welcome this notoriety and consistently warn money-launderers to stay away. But the truth is that Cayman's reputation for banking secrecy has been a magnet for clean and dirty money alike. It now plays host to 600 banks sitting on about $1 trillion in deposits; its investment managers look after an additional $200 billion; and the island is also a major centre for the captive insurance market. </p> <p>Alongside the institutions, a wealthy class of financiers, lawyers and company agents has grown up, many of them expat Brits and Americans. Throw in the island's natural attractions - it is one of the world's premier scuba-diving spots - and you have a well-heeled paradise. </p> <p>So it was striking to see TV footage of those same expats after Hurricane Ivan, shocked and shivering amid the rubble of their seafront homes, and queuing for rations at makeshift food huts. </p> <p>Damage of more than $1 billion was caused but when a BBC News crew tried to film the aftermath, they were at first denied access by the authorities. </p> <p>'Our machinery has not been enough to open doors totally to the international media,' Bruce Dinwiddy, Cayman's governor, said in explanation. </p> <p>The island insists it is not trying to play down the devastation, pointing out that its chief minister is flying to London to discuss the emergency with ministers and Whitehall officials this week. </p> <p>Still, it all rather begs the question: won't all those traumatised profession als be tempted to relocate to other sun-kissed tax havens, where air-conditioned offices and five-star conference centres still exist? </p> <p>After all, several Cayman-based firms evacuated their staff ahead of the hurricane and successfully continued to run their operations from branches in other tax havens. And Jersey, for one, seems to have spied an opportunity. </p> <p>'There are considerable advantages to being in Jersey in terms of stability - political stability, economic stability, and in terms of global climate change,' said David Carse, head of the Jersey Financial Commission. </p> <p>'It may be difficult at times to get in or out of the island because of fog, but other jurisdictions are in a much more difficult position.' </p> <p>Grand Cayman officials insist that the island's finance sector has suffered no more than a hiccup. Little data has been lost, few of the office buildings in George Town, the island's capital, have been badly damaged, and most basic services such as electricity were restored within a week. Within days of the hurricane the island's Companies Registry was up and running, even open on Saturday to clear the backlog of work. </p> <p>'An almost continuous service was maintained. We are confident this will not effect the running of the finance sector,' Steve John, a spokesman for the island, said yesterday. He added that Cayman was 'extremely grateful' to other jurisdictions for their help. </p> <p>Still, Cayman may soon have to cope with problems of another kind. John Kerry, who led the Senate investigation into BCCI's collapse, is a longstanding critic of tax havens has promised to 'provide middle-class payroll tax relief to get money in the pockets of workers who will spend it, not more tax giveaways for those at the top to stimulate the economy in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda'. </p> <p>On another occasion, he told supporters there were 'enough brass-plate companies down in the Cayman Islands to make anybody in America sick when they look at their own tax bill'. </p> <p>Doubtless some in George Town are praying for a Bush victory in next month's presidential poll. But even a Republican administration may seek to tackle tax flight, given the widely predicted budgetary constraints it will face if re-elected. Bush's government, worried about terrorist funding, has already bullied Cayman and other offshore finance centres into draconian exchange-of-information agreements. </p> <p>There isn't much that a little Caribbean island can do against political pressure of this kind. But despite Kerry and other critics, Cayman can claim with justification to have cracked down on abuse in recent years. The island has signed up to OECD and Financial Action Task Force guidelines, increasing financial supervision and tightening its rules against money laundering and illicit tax flight. </p> <p>The problem with meeting all these international standards, however, is that they make the island less and less easy to differentiate from any other offshore haven. The time may come when Grand Cayman is no longer destination of choice for that most valued customer, the American tax avoider.</p>",
  "<p>I had read the cuttings before I met Lee Amaitis and boy, was I worried. He was the 'Brooklyn bruiser' who ran the 'sleaziest, most disgusting' company in the City; he had threatened to 'take out a contract' on a rival; he encouraged staff to 'go out whoring' and snort cocaine; his anger was legendary; his Anglo-Saxon formidable. With a curtain-raiser like this from the press. I wondered if I'd end up sleeping with the fishes in the Thames. </p> <p> I got out alive, after an anti-climactic hour talking mostly about the new challenge Amaitis faces as chairman and chief executive of BGC, the money-broker spin-off from Cantor Fitzgerald. No horses' heads, no offers I couldn't refuse, and not a line of Bolivian marching powder in sight. </p> <p> Amaitis was soberly dressed in collar and tie, with slicked-back hair and designer-cropped goatee. All aspersions aside, he still looks like the kind of man you'd rather have on your side in a bare-knuckle fight than against you. </p> <p> 'All those things were just somebody else's opinions,' he says when I ask him about his reputation, 'so I just don't comment on them. But I can't say I'm a smooth stone. I have my rough edges and my past, especially in the London media, has been colourful, to say the least.' </p> <p> And that's just since 2001. Until then, Cantor Fitzerald was little-known outside a fairly small circle of City traders, but on 11 September it became synonymous with New York's tragedy when 658 of its employees were among the victims of the attack on the World Trade Centre, the biggest loss of life by a single firm. </p> <p> Amaitis was in Britain on that day and watched on TV as the towers - and much of Cantor's American business - collapsed. 'I felt anger that people could have done that to us and to America,' he recalls. His anger subsided, to grow into a general worry about security and survival. But the events of 9/11 have contributed to a change in the way Cantor does business, and led indirectly to the establishment of BGC, which officially started up last week. </p> <p> Cantor's money-broking business had been pulled in two directions long before the attacks in America. Inter-dealer brokers act as middle men between the world's big financial institutions when they want to lend money to each other on terms of anonymity, often for short periods. </p> <p> Technological advances in the 1990s meant electronic dealing was becoming an increasingly attractive way of doing business at the expense of old-style 'voice' broking, which had originated in the trading pits. Cantor provided both. </p> <p> Tragically, Cantor's voice brokers were the main victims of 9/11. The electronic systems could be restarted and trading resumed within hours of the disaster from its back-up site in Connecticut, but there was silence on the other end of the phone for those who wanted inter-dealing broker services. It brought about a rethink of how Cantor did business, and the result was BGC. </p> <p> 'I'm very excited,' says Amaitis. 'I've never been a chairman before and I have a business that presents challenges and opportunities.' </p> <p> The strategy is to start again in voice broking, but from London, and to try to win back global market share from the BGC base in America Square in the City. The operation was formally unveiled in August, but Amaitis had the headhunters in long before that. </p> <p> 'We've been hiring for the past six months and have attracted a lot of talent,' he says, estimating that the firm has hired around 100 new employees and there is still no end in sight to the hiring spree. 'If the talent keeps coming, it can produce profit and we'll keep hiring.' </p> <p> Which hits on the other reason Amaitis and Cantor have been in the headlines since 2001. After an initial wave of sympathy, rivals began to see that the events in New York had destabilised Cantor and its top stars were easy to lure away. A series of court cases followed in which Cantor alleged unfair practices, and former employees countered with lurid tales of corporate life under Amaitis. Most notably Steven Horkulak, a senior director who claimed to have been outraged and intimidated by his boss's ripe language and energetic social life. </p> <p> 'I'm a passionate guy,' admits Amaitis. 'I accept responsibility for what goes on and I've got to make sure it goes the right way. I have to make it work.' </p> <p> This time, BGC is motivating its staff with the chance to rebuild a business and a chunk of the partnership structure it has agreed with Cantor. 'One of the reasons for the partnership is to ensure loyalty. The structure means that you decide what to pay yourself,' he says. </p> <p> But he seems to have learnt a lesson from the legal episodes. There have been no anger-management lessons, no counselling sessions on intra-personal relationship s, but he says: 'Maybe I take a couple of seconds longer to think before I speak. But I will never lose the passion. You have to have that.' </p> <p> His life has something of the American dream about it. His father was an emigr\u00e9 from Lithuania who worked in the Pennsylvania coal mines before moving to New York when the industry started running down. His mother was born in America, of Lithuanian descent. Young Lee left high school in the mid-1960 and 'pursued a career in the thoroughbred racing industry'. </p> <p> By the 1980s, he was running his own broking business until joining Cantor Fitzgerald as managing director in 1995. In between, there were brushes with the law for drug abuse and a spell in rehab for alcohol dependency - all woven into his myth. </p> <p> Those hellfire days seem to be well and truly over. His fianc\u00e9e is expecting their second child and he is as proud as any father to show off pictures of her and his young boy, Vincent Michael (named after two friends who died on 9/11). His leisure time is spent with his family, he says. He doesn't mention lap-dancing clubs or cocaine, and I don't ask. </p> <p> The business will take up most of his time now. Money broking is a fiercely competitive market in London, dominated by larger-than-life characters, such as Icap's Michael Spencer and Terry Smith of Collins Stewart Tullet. </p> <p> 'I don't worry much about the opposition,' he says. 'We have a different game plan. We're starting from scratch. And I've always regarded technology as an aid to back up trust and relationship. I came out of the pit, where we did deals not even on a handshake, but on a voice deal.' </p> <p> I said goodbye as BGC staff prepared a drinks party to celebrate their new firm. Amaitis said he would be in the office until seven if I needed to check anything. I got away. No concrete overcoat, no psychological trauma - not even a single expletive in my notebook.</p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name:</strong> Lee Amaitis </p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> 19 December 1949, Brooklyn, New York </p> <p><strong> School:</strong> Bishop Laughlin RC High School, Brooklyn </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> 'Thoroughbred race business'; broking; Cantor Fitzerald since 1995; currently chairman and chief executive of BGC Partners </p> <p><strong> Marital status: </strong> Divorcing; one son with fianc\u00e9e Kiley, who is expecting their next child </p> <p><strong> Leisure: </strong> Charitable work, especially on behalf of children; horse-racing, and 'whatever my partner and my boy want to do'</p>",
  "<p>Women's-only winter sports programmes were born and bred in North America. There's the Roxy All-Star Snowboard camp for women in Whistler, on the west coast of Canada. Which sounds cool. And Women In Motion, an exclusive ski programme developed by women for women on the east coast of the US. Which sounds a bit worthy. Now, at long last, there's a women's-only snowboard package available in the Alps. And this one sounds like it's got the balance between enjoying the sport and having a fun week away with the girls just about right.</p> <p>The rudegirl snowboard weeks are run by Essex-based operator rudechalets (07974 933973, <a href=\"http://www.rudechalets.com\">rudechalets.com</a>) in Morzine, France. They start from \u00a3515pp and include tuition from British pro rider Becci Malthouse. The serious bit is to encourage girls to take up or improve their snowboarding \"without feeling intimidated by the macho snowboard scene which often exists in the parks and the pipe\". There's an onsite Option snowboard centre to try out different boards until you find your ideal spec. And, if you get really serious, you can take a workshop in the art of snowboard maintenance.</p> <p>The fun starts back at Chalet Christophe, a traditional-looking alpine pad on the outside but one which is foxily decked-out on the inside: leather sofas, giant cushions, a 42-inch plasma screen and, driving the apr\u00e8s ski party, a mini bar that has been fashioned from - you've guessed it - the front end of a Mini car.</p> <p>All seven bedrooms have en suite facilities, flat screen TVs, PlayStation2/DVD/CD players, and are themed around different extreme sports. There's a wooden terrace with Mexican hammocks and deckchairs, providing ample opportunity to work on the winter tan. And there's a hot tub from which you can enjoy the mountain views with a glass of wine while soothing those aching muscles.</p> <p>The package includes full Portes du Soleil lift passes, half-board, unlimited local wine, transfers from Geneva, and the bonus of a T-shirt and knickers gift set.</p> <p><strong>Newfie comes in for the cold</strong></p> <p>It's not easy - as yet - to get to Marble Mountain, a ski area offering guaranteed deep natural snow on the Canadian island of Newfoundland (remember The Shipping News?).</p> <p>This Christmas, however, holiday company Barwell Leisure (020-8786 3092, <a href=\"http://www.barwell.co.uk\">barwell.co.uk</a>) launches charter flights from Gatwick. These will put this little-known Canadian outpost on the family ski holiday map for several reasons: Newfoundland is only five hours away (the shortest transatlantic route), and has a maritime climate (so your children won't get frostbite). Add in alternatives to skiing such as snowmobiling, bear and bird-watching, quad-biking, golf and luxury accommodation (super-roomy chalets) at nearby Humber Valley resort (humbervalley.com) and the recipe starts to look very attractive indeed. One-week self-catering with Gatwick-Deer Lake flights from \u00a3595 adult, \u00a3495 child (car hire is essential: from \u00a3150). Christmas week from \u00a3745.</p> <p><strong>The pod squad</strong></p> <p>One of the most exciting additions to the slopes this season is a futuristic-looking ski camp in the Swiss Alps.</p> <p>Whitepod (whitepod.com) is a retreat of five dome-shaped tents set on raised wooden platforms above the ski resort of Villars, near the town of Aigle. The pods are reached on skis or snowshoes and you ski straight out from the camp on to the slopes. The idea is to provide a tranquil and beautiful winter setting while having a minimal impact on the environment.

  "If there is one manoeuvre at which Tony Blair is particularly skilled, it's the feint. He turns his back on the euro? He makes \"the most passionately pro-European speech of his career\". He dumps on Gordon? He praises Gordon in his conference speech. He brings back Alan Milburn? He drops the term New Labour. Actually, this is more than a manoeuvre, it is one of the prime minister's most basic political instincts. It has become his way of life. <p>And there has never been a more perfect example of it than this week's revelations about his future. On the one hand, signs of mortality - the heart operation and the expensive house for his post-Downing Street life. On the other, instinct kicking in, the firm announcement that he's going nowhere, for five years or so at least. </p> <p>So the first question is whether that political bombshell - the promise of him serving a full third term if elected - means anything at all? Imagine what the headlines would have been like had he not said it. The heart flutter, the house, the mayhem in Iraq, the narrow squeak at Hartlepool (and I bet he was being advised before his 10pm broadcasts that he could lose it) and a conference dominated in the media by continued headlines about splits and briefings ... everyone would have been preparing his political obituaries. </p> <p>The Tories were preparing a \"vote Blair, get Brown\" attack. So given that Blair had to say he was staying, was he really saying anything worth listening to at all? </p> <p>The next question is the common-sense one: how can he have any idea about how long he will stay? He was punctilious about repeating in his interviews that it was up to the British people. But it isn't as simple as that. </p> <p>Labour is still the huge, overwhelming favourite to win the next general election. No one really thinks they won't all still be securely in power by next summer. The only alternative government now is a Tory one, and the Tories, as Hartlepool showed, are out of the game. But Labour's majority? That's an entirely different matter. </p> <p>A Lib-Dem surge, which everybody expects, makes the calculations difficult. In some places it will help Tories, in a very few seats it will help Labour. But mostly it's bad news for Blair, and the size of the majority will have a crucial effect on the politics after 2005. If it's only say, 40 to 60 seats, it will mean Blair has lost dozens of loyal backbenchers. He will find himself depending on disaffected ex-ministers, leftwing MPs and rebels. He will therefore have to cut back on his most radical market-mimicking ideas (not that the super-loyal Blairites offered a coherent view of what their \"radical\" manifesto would consist of at conference). And Blair will be more vulnerable to hostility from the Brownites, not less so. It seems he has realised this and, like the supreme tactician he is, prepared for it by rowing back to a more traditional Labour agenda and rhetoric at Brighton. </p> <p>But if that happens, will he enjoy it? He's gone through at least one long, dark night of the soul before, so why wouldn't he be plunged in gloom if he found himself hemmed in after the election? </p> <p>The global stage won't offer an escape from mutinous backbenchers. Africa and global warming are genuine enthusiasms, but they are unlikely to dominate his life. It will be more Iraq, and more war on terror. If Bush is re-elected, can Blair really be so confident of that revived Middle East peace process we heard about this week? </p> <p>Yes, there are a lot of what-if thoughts in those last few paragraphs. But that's my point. Blair is likely to be able to stay in office after the election. His ability to govern in an effective, popular way is much less predictable. It depends on outside events, and his own authority. </p> <p>What is clear is that his announcement will provoke ferocious jostling from now on. People are already doing the calculations. A four-year term is now considered \"full\", so to allow time for a succession we are probably talking about Blair going at the very latest by the winter or early spring of 2008-09. From now until then, half a dozen ministers will be plotting where they want to be, job by job, to gain maximum exposure. They will be wooing the party. There will be briefings by unacknowledged \"campaign managers\" who expect plum jobs if their man, or woman, wins. None of this will help the government's - or Blair's - authority. Blair could begin to look like a lame duck rather earlier than anyone might have expected. </p> <p>Meanwhile, what happens to Brown? He advised against a pre-announced resignation date when he thought it would merely cause difficulties for a few months, but this is infinitely worse. Is he really expected to stay at the Treasury for another five years, grinding out budgets? But the Foreign Office would be a demotion and he would be unlikely to take it. Yet again, could Blair with a smaller majority afford to have Brown, alongside Robin Cook, on the backbenches? </p> <p>So we should listen to Blair's words about the third term without taking them at face value. The house is real, the heart operation is real ... and the rest is mere assertion about the unknowable future. We all have intentions. But as the prime minister knows very well, fate is full of surprises. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It was not possible to verify the tape independently, but the voice sounded similar to that on earlier messages. </p> <p>The inflammatory appeal coincided with the suicide bombing of a Shia mosque in Pakistan which killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens - a sectarian attack which officials said might also have had al-Qaida links. </p> <p>More than 1,000 people were in the mosque in Sialkot, 100 miles south-east of Islamabad, when a man rushed in and detonated a briefcase bomb. </p> <p>Twelve people died instantly and the blast left a 2ft deep crater. </p> <p>A Shia cleric, Allama Saeed Hasan, saw blood on the ceil ing and walls. \"People were shouting and screaming ... Enemies of Islam and Pakistan are responsible for this,\" he told Reuters news agency. </p> <p>More than 50 wounded victims were taken to hospital, where several more died. The death toll was expected to rise. </p> <p>No group claimed responsibility, but Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's information minister, said the attack could have been in retaliation for last weekend's killing of a Sunni militant leader, Amjad Hussain Farooqi, who had high-level al-Qaida links. </p> <p>He died in a gun battle after being cornered by the security forces at a house in Sind province. </p> <p>Mr Farooqi was believed to have played a key role in two attempts to assassinate President Pervez Musharraf and the murder of the American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. </p> <p>Other Sunni extremists may have carried out yesterday's bombing to avenge his death, Sheikh Ahmed said. </p> <p>The bombing caused a violent reaction in Sialkot, and riot police were sent to quell a stone-throwing mob which set fire to police vehicles and chanted slogans against the government. </p> <p>Sunnis comprise about 70% of Pakistan's population, Shias 20%.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Duval, the Australian sports promoter who is behind tomorrow's Superset event at Wembley Arena, was watching tennis on television one afternoon when he realised he ought to have been elsewhere. \"I had to race somewhere, and I never did see the end of it,\" he said. \"And that started the thought process.\" </p> <p>Superset is a knockout competition played over one set, with a winner-takes-all first prize of \u00a3250,000. The basic rules and scoring are unchanged with the winner the first to get to 10 games. If the set is level at 10-10 then the normal tie-break is played. </p> <p>Duval wanted to create a novel environment without compromising the conventional game. \"Let's not try to take away from the original format, let's add to it,\" he said. \"Let's show people something different.\" </p> <p>He launched a pilot tournament last November in Portland, Oregon, comprising eight US ATP Tour players, including Andre Agassi. The London event includes three former Wimbledon champions -Goran Ivanisevic, Boris Becker and John McEnroe - as well as Britain's latest hope, Andrew Murray, who has replaced the injured Tim Henman. </p> <p>Crowd participation is positively encouraged and if a player queries a line-call Hawkeye and slow-motion replays can be called up by the umpire and will be shown on a large plasma screen. A player can question any amount of line calls provided it is not seen as a tactic to slow down the game or to disturb the opponent. If so, then the umpire can dock the player a penalty point. </p> <p>Players' coaches are allowed on courtside at the change of ends for 30 seconds, and they will be wired up to loud speakers so spectators can hear what is happening. Players will also wear heart monitors and their pulse rate will also be displayed. </p> <p>Unlike Twenty20 cricket, Superset does not appear to be a format immediately open to further development, although some may worry that its truncated form is the thin end of the wedge that could ultimately influence the organisers of the grand slams and the Davis Cup to shelve the men's five-set formula in favour of the best of three - something that television executives would love to see happen. </p> <p>On the other hand, tournaments on the men's and women's tours, notably during the indoor season, could benefit from the technological and promotional innovations used at Superset. </p> <p><strong> Opening matches:</strong> Greg Rusedski (GB) v Boris Becker (Ger); Goran Ivanisevic (Cro) v Tommy Robredo (Spa); Robby Ginepri (US) v Mario Ancic (Cro); John McEnroe (US) v Andrew Murray (GB).<strong> Semi-finals:</strong> Winner match 1 v winner match 2; winner match 3 v winner match 4. </p> <p><strong> TV: Sky Sports 2, 2.30pm tomorrow</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>James Toseland will aim to win a championship tomorrow that could influence the shape of international motorcycle and car sport worldwide. </p> <p>The British rider will compete in the final round of the World Superbike series at Magny-Cours, France, on an exotic factory Ducati. But he has only as much chance of winning as his Australian rival Chris Vermeulen, who rides a privately prepared Honda Fireblade worth a mere \u00a340,000. </p> <p>The superbike championship is operating under radical new rules this year that give any well organised team a chance of success. As a result, it has exposed formula one for the boring spectacle it is. And it has even made MotoGP, motorcycling's premier championship, seem processional. </p> <p>The rejig has certainly made life tough for the 23-year-old Toseland, who will become the youngest champion in the 17-year history of the series if he takes the title after the two races at Magny-Cours. </p> <p>Carl Fogarty and Neil Hodgson, Britain's former superbike kings, enjoyed the best tyres, with their Michelin technicians giving them an advantage of up to a second a lap over other riders. </p> <p>But Paolo Flammini, the head of superbike's promoter FG Sport, booted out Michelin and Dunlop at the end of 2003 and signed a one-make tyre deal with Pirelli. Now every rider is supplied with identical rubber, and that has created intense competition. </p> <p>Six riders, including Toseland, have won races this year and four riders have led the championship. Toseland has done so twice, but going into tomorrow's round he trails his Ducati Fila team-mate, the Frenchman Regis Laconi, by four points. Vermeulen is 13 points behind Laconi, with 25 available for the winner of each race. </p> <p>Toseland welcomes the rule change that dealt him a severe challenge in the very year that he gained his first full factory contract. </p> <p>\"This is exactly what superbike racing needs,\" he said. \"At the beginning of the season, after the Japanese manu facturers had pulled out, it looked like the series was in trouble. But we've had different winners and championship leaders. At least half a dozen guys could win at Magny on Sunday.\" </p> <p>It seems that all four Japanese manufacturers - Kawasaki, Suzuki, Yamaha and Honda - will return to world superbikes next year. The series gives them a global stage to showcase 200bhp, 200mph motorcycles based on showroom models. </p> <p>Getting on to the superbike grid will cost them a fraction of the sum involved in competing in MotoGP. Mark Griffiths, owner of Britain's Renegade Ducati team, has spent \u00a31.6m this year fielding the two-man squad of Leon Haslam and Noriyuki Haga; Kenny Roberts, owner of the Proton KR MotoGP team, says that it costs them $30m (\u00a316.7m) a year to compete. </p> <p>Ducati will continue in world superbikes - but whether Toseland will be part of the scene is uncertain. He scored erratically in the early part of the season and Ducati want two strong riders to fend off the increased competition from the four-cylinder Japanese bikes next year. </p> <p>\"In recent races James has put his head down and is looking much more confident and competitive,\" Ducati's spokesman Julian Thomas said. \"But it's too early to say who will ride for us next year. The final races and the championship standings will have a bearing on who we choose for 2005.\" </p> <p>In other words, Toseland will be fighting for more than a world title tomorrow: he'll be protecting a job. </p> <p>On the same day in Qatar, Yamaha and Honda will slug it out in a MotoGP technology contest that has left all other manufacturers trailing. Even Ducati, who won a race last year, are struggling to get a podium position. </p> <p>For how many more seasons will Suzuki, Ducati and Aprilia turn up, only to be pummelled into submission by the big two? MotoGP, and formula one too, could learn from the rules that ban madly expensive engine-tuning in superbike racing. </p> <p><strong> TV: 10am tomorrow, Eurosport</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>The shockwaves generated by Bernie Ecclestone's decision to scrap the British grand prix rippled out yesterday to touch every corner of the country's motorsport industry, threatening Britain's position as the global centre of international motor racing. </p> <p>The move by Ecclestone, the formula one commercial rights holder, has threatened to destabilise an industry worth \u00a33bn and has implications for companies large and small, whether directly involved in the sport or not. Silverstone's grand prix contributes about \u00a340m annually to the local economy in the Towcester region and its loss from the 2005 calendar will be felt in the till of every pub and restaurant in the area. </p> <p>Britain's entire motor racing infrastucture, ranging from small specialist formula Ford makers such as Van Diemen in Norfolk through to multimillion-pound front-line formula one teams such as Williams and McLaren, have all benefited from the \"halo effect\" of being associated with the grand prix. </p> <p>\"It is widely acknowledged that the British grand prix makes a significant direct contribution to the UK economy each year and that it is an important flagship for the hugely successful British motorsports industry,\" said the Motor Sports Association chairman John Grant. \"We seem to have arrived in the situation where a funding shortfall of some \u00a32-3m a year is standing in the way of retaining an iconic event which is vital for our sport.\" </p> <p>Alex Hooton, chief executive of the British Racing Drivers Club, which owns the circuit, warned that the race's cancellation would have a serious knock-on effect on the group of companies that make up \"motorsport valley\" between Cambridge and Oxford. </p> <p>\"If we lose the race for only a year or two there will be a major impact on tourism-related industries in the immediate area but it will have less of an impact for the motorsport industry,\" he said. \"However, over time, if we do not get the grand prix back then there is going to be an erosion of the motorsport industry in the surrounding area. </p> <p>\"We're confident that it will come back to Silverstone, and we will continue to analyse the redevelopment options of the circuit, which will be a major investment of between \u00a380m and \u00a3100m.\" </p> <p>Tony Purnell, the Jaguar team principal, said the effects would not be felt immediately. \"But in the medium to long term I think it's going to be as if one was diagnosed as suffering from a serious illness,\" he said. Purnell himself is currently battling to find a buyer for his beleaguered formula one team, which will otherwise close at the end of the season. One knock-on effect of that is to put Eddie Jordan's team under threat, reliant as they are on engines supplied by Ford, Jaguar's parent company. </p> <p>One local councillor assessed the loss to the local economy close to Silverstone at as much as \u00a350m a year, taking into account the income from pubs, bed-and-breakfast facilities and restaurants. As always, it will be the smaller traders who are the most vulnerable. </p> <p>\"The grand prix certainly does have that halo effect,\" said Purnell. \"It adds image and prestige to the entire motorsport industry. It's also inspirational in the sense that I suspect there will be less interest, in the long term, from young engineers to make their career within the industry.\" </p> <p>Dick Bennetts, who runs the independent team West Surrey Racing, which this year contested the British touring car championship with two MG saloons, is another who appreciates the benefits of the British grand prix as an international calling card for the sport as a whole. </p> <p>\"I'm not involved in formula one,\" said Bennetts. \"But I always go to the British grand prix, perhaps meeting up with a potential sponsor who I think might be interested in becoming involved with us. In that sense, the British grand prix is a calling card for the sport.\" </p> <p>There is also a sense of indignation within the sport's community that the government has not been more robust in its support for the grand prix. </p> <p>\"When Ford announced that it was planning to close its famous Browns Lane manufacturing plant in Coventry, Tony Blair stood up and said he would do all he could to help,\" said one formula one team executive yesterday. \"That involved about 400 jobs. If Jaguar's formula one team and Cosworth should go down - and, heaven forbid, take Jordan with them - then we'd be talking about another 1500-odd redundancies in the area between Milton Keynes and Brackley. Plus the problems of all the small subcontractors who service them.\" </p> <p><strong>Impact on the community:</strong></p> <p><strong>CEO at Whittlebury Hall, the nearest hotel to Silverstone</strong></p> <p>I'm very shocked and very disappointed. It's going to have a detrimental effect on the hotel, though it is not dependent on the grand prix. It's not so much the financial loss but the prestige. The drivers stay at the hotel and have their regular bedrooms. But I think the much bigger issue is for the local economy because there are so many people who are dependent on the grand prix.</p> <p><strong>Derek Mapp, Chairman East Midlands development agency</strong></p> <p>We have been involved with this for some time so it's not come as a major shock. However, the show is not over until the fat lady sings and she hasn't sung yet; we have until October 13 to resolve the matter. The grand prix contributes around \u00a340m to the local economy. A lot of hotels and businesses will be affected but this is not the end of motorsport at Silverstone, it's the proposed end of formula one.</p> <p><strong>Chris Knapman, Collectors Carbooks</strong></p> <p>We take quite a few thousand pounds over a grand prix weekend which, presumably, we will now lose. A lot of people also wander in off the street, having seen Silverstone on the map and thought, ooh, I've seen the race on the telly, so hopefully they will buy a book as well. I suspect we may have to ask for a reduction in the rent.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I have a great deal of bay, which I trim back at this time of year. Can I use the leaves for compost?</strong> </p> <p>There are two problems with composting bayleaves. One is that they are tough and pretty solid, so they can take up to five years to turn into good compost. This is the case for all evergreen leaves, although composting can be speeded up by putting the branches through a shredder. The second problem is perhaps more serious. Bays are among a few plants that contain toxic resins and acids that inhibit the growth of other plants. A small amount of these leaves in a compost bin will not create any problems, but it sounds as if you have quite a lot. A pure bayleaf compost could only be used for mulching bay trees. The same goes for the leaves of eucalyptus, rhododendron, juniper, walnut and cypress trees. Instead, have a bonfire with the trimmings and add the ash to the compost. It is a good source of nutrients. </p> <p><strong>I have dormant bulbs in various places in a border that is covered in weeds. In the past, I hand-weeded, but I am now over 80 and find it a chore. No one can tell me of a weedkiller suitable for use over bulbs. Can you help?</strong> </p> <p>The chemical you need is glyphosate, sold as Roundup, which, it is claimed, breaks down on contact with the soil. Although it has always been marketed as an environmentally-sound chemical that does not harm soil organisms or get into ground water (it has even been accepted for use in organic systems in some parts of the world), it is worth mentioning that serious doubts have recently been raised about its toxicity to both humans and the environment, and great controversy now surrounds any environmental claims. Roundup won't harm your bulbs, however, as long as you use it only when they are completely dormant. For the future, why not also consider planting some ground-cover plants, such as geraniums, which will suppress the weeds, but which the bulb foliage can grow through?</p>",
  "<p>Some homebuyers could be left high and dry if their mortgage broker is not geared up for new home loan rules coming in at the end of the month, according to a warning issued this week. </p> <p>Not only is October 31 Halloween - this year it's also Mortgage Day. On that date the Financial Services Authority becomes responsible for policing Britain's multi-billion pound mortgage industry. </p> <p>The new regime should mean a better deal for people taking out home loans, but there are bound to be a few glitches while everything beds down - and there will inevitably be some firms that fail to get their act together in time for the big change-over. </p> <p>If you're looking to take out a mortgage this month and are planning to talk to a broker or financial adviser, it's important to make sure the firm you use has the necessary authorisation in place. </p> <p>The worst case scenario is that some broker firms could be forced to cease trading just as many of their customers' mortgage applications are being processed, resulting in people's home loans being delayed or, worse, homebuyers losing their mortgage deals completely. </p> <p>\"The consequences for homebuyers and sellers could be appalling, with many applicants having to start the entire mortgage process again,\" says Richard Brown, chief executive of Moneynet, an online financial research and data website. </p> <p>After Mortgage Day it will be a criminal offence to sell most types of mortgages unless a firm has had the green light from the FSA. Mr Brown is worried that a sizeable number of mortgage brokers will not have the necessary permission in place to trade under the new regime, but the industry's main trade body, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, is keen to dispel such fears, saying: \"We are not expecting this to be a widespread problem.\" </p> <p>It adds that the vast majority of mortgage broker firms do seem to be on track to be authorised in time. But to avoid possible problems, consumers should check that their broker is registered with the Mortgage Code Compliance Board (the body that will regulate mortgages until October 31) and will be authorised to undertake mortgage business under the new rules, before applying for a home loan. </p> <p><strong> Why will this new regulatory regime mean a better deal for borrowers?</strong> For the first time mortgages will be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as personal pensions, unit trusts and other investments. The FSA will be monitoring the behaviour of more than 100 lenders and 7,000 broker and IFA firms. It will be insisting the information companies give people about loans is clear, comparable and comprehensive - and coming down hard on rule-breakers. </p> <p>The new system includes rules on everything from the fees attached to mortgages -they mustn't be \"excessive\" - to the way people who fall behind with their monthly payments are treated. But the biggest difference that people will probably notice is the introduction of something called a \"key facts illustration\", or KFI. </p> <p><strong> What's that then? </strong> When someone applies for a mortgage they will, after answering a number of questions, be handed a KFI. This is a document, probably running to several pages in some cases, that will set out all the key information about the mortgage such as the overall cost of the loan and any fees you have to pay. </p> <p>It will, for example, tell you precisely how much you will be paying back to the lender for every \u00a31 that you're borrowing, and (if relevant) how much your monthly payments would go up by if interest rates were to increase. These KFI factsheets will present the information in a standardised format which should make it easier to compare mortgages from different companies. So after doing the rounds of the banks and building societies on a Saturday morning, you may end up clutching four or five KFI documents and can then compare how the deals stack up against each other. </p> <p><strong> Who's paying for all these changes? Joe Punter I suppose?</strong> The home loans business has estimated that the new regulatory regime will add \u00a3100-plus to the cost of each mortgage sold. </p> <p>The FSA reckons the one-off cost of regulation will be \u00a3136m, plus ongoing costs of \u00a368m a year, and puts the estimated cost to the consumer at \u00a33.90 per month in the first year of a mortgage. </p> <p>However, it adds that many companies are likely to absorb the costs. The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, says it is competition, not regulation, that dictates pricing in the mortgage market - and this is a fiercely competitive industry. </p> <p><strong> Is it going to be paper overload?</strong> That's what some experts reckon. Some say the KFIs could well run to six pages. And there have been suggestions that the new system will mean longer interviews with advisers, with lots more questions being asked. But, quizzed on this point, the FSA says this is not necessarily the case, with the length of interviews depending on things such as the complexity of your circumstances. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Halifax says that, at the moment, an interview for a mortgage with one of its advisers typically takes about an hour, and is not expected to take any longer post-October 31. </p> <p><strong> Are buy-to-let mortgages covered by the new rules?</strong> No, they are excluded as they are regarded as commercial loans. Not everyone is happy about that. If you buy a house to live in it, the mortgage is regulated, but if you buy the same house to let it out, the mortgage is not regulated, says Jonathan Cornell at home loans broker Hamptons Mortgages. </p> <p>He adds: \"Why should landlords not receive statutory protection on their mortgage?\" He is unhappy about some other aspects of the regime too. The \"overall cost for comparison\" figure on the KFI documents will be an APR (annual percentage rate) figure. </p> <p>But, says Mr Cornell, it's worked out on the basis that a borrower taking out, say, a two-year discount or two-year fixed rate deal then has 23 years on the lender's standard variable rate - hardly representative of many new borrowers who will hop to another deal when the special rate has ended. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Guardian and Observer Guide to Remortgaging, sponsored by Moneyextra, is available free on 0845 300 4519</p>",
  "<p>After months of unrelenting pressure from our children, we've finally decided to give in and let them have the pet cats they so desperately desire. </p> <p>The plan is to get two kittens in time for Christmas and, yes - before you ask - we do appreciate that a cat is for life and not just for Christmas. </p> <p>This gives us pet-owning novices three months to find out how to care for them, get the required litter tray, cat-flap and so on and recruit someone to look after the cats when we go on holiday. All that remains is to source the right kittens - ideally, two short-haired females. </p> <p>And that's the hard bit. Where do you go to buy healthy, well cared-for kittens and what should you expect to pay? I had no idea at first. </p> <p>The local veterinary clinic/pet shop wasn't much help. \"We don't actually source kittens for customers though we sometimes get people advertising kittens on our noticeboard or you could look on the internet,\" the assistant said. </p> <p>Now though, after talking to feline charities, pet insurers, cat clubs and breeders, I'm a bit more clued up. </p> <p>The key thing is to get your animal from a reliable source such as an animal shelter, a friend or a recommended cat breeder so that you know about its background and that it has been looked after. </p> <p>\"You need to know where a kitten has come from, that it is healthy and not inbred and that it has not been taken from its mother too young - ideally, not before nine weeks old,\" says a spokeswoman for Cats Protection, the UK's largest feline charity. </p> <p>A good owner should allow you to visit their home to view the kittens with their mother and the surroundings should be hygienic with clean litter trays and alert, playful kittens. You should always take a new kitten straight to a vet for a full health check. </p> <p>If you are after a pedigree cat, expect to pay anything from \u00a3150 for a good quality \"pet-class\" cat from a reputable breeder and \u00a3250 upwards for an animal of breeding or show quality. Prices vary geographically; those in the south-east are often higher than in the north. </p> <p>A good way to track down a reputable breeder is to contact one of the 147 cat clubs affiliated to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), the UK's feline equivalent of the Kennel Club and the body responsible for registering pedigree cats. </p> <p>Cat clubs, some of which specialise in particular breeds and others which cover all breeds in a given region, are listed on the GCCF website at <a href=\"http://www.gccfcats.org\">gccfcats.org</a> (tel: 01278-427-575). </p> <p>Their members follow GCCF guidelines in only selling kittens of 13 weeks or more that have been fully innoculated, house trained and registered - all included in the price. </p> <p>The GCCF will advise on the right sort of breeds to suit your family's needs and put you in contact with appropriate clubs who can then supply you with kitten lists or a list of breeders. </p> <p>It advises telephoning some breeders and getting an idea of prices of kittens before fixing visits. Breeders should be happy to show you their kittens without compelling you to buy, but don't expect a breeder to keep a kitten for you indefinitely. You may be expected to pay a non-returnable deposit if the kitten is to be kept for any length of time after it is ready to go to a new home, it says. </p> <p>Neither the GCCF nor animal charities tend to recommend buying kittens from pet shops or through adverts in local papers, primarily because it's hard to be sure about the cat's origin and health. </p> <p>You'll pay far less for a pedigree if you are willing to take on an older cat that needs re-housing, perhaps because their owner is ill or is emigrating. Most cat clubs hold details of pedigrees needing a new home and available to the right new owner (they'll check you out first) for a token donation or free of charge. </p> <p>If you are not bothered about pedigrees and it's a straightforward moggy you want, keep your ear to the ground for news of friends and neighbours who may have a new litter. Whenever possible buy from a source that has been recommended to you by someone whose judgment you trust. </p> <p>Some cat clubs, such as the Coventry &amp; Leicester Cat Club, for example, will put you on to moggies as well as pedigrees from reputable sources. But, for the \u00a310 or \u00a320 you pay for a moggy, don't expect it to be already innoculated and house trained. </p> <p>Adopting an unwanted cat or kitten for free from one of the many feline charity rescue centres around the UK can be an excellent way of getting a pet, because you'll also benefit from the advice and knowledge of experienced and dedicated staff. </p> <p>Animal welfare is the priority of all rescue organisations, and you will first have to undergo a home visit to ensure the animal will fit in to its new environment. There may also be a cost involved, as some charities have animals neutered and even microchipped before they are allowed home to their new owners. </p> <p>You'll find a directory of rescue centres by UK region at <a href=\"http://www.pethealthcare.co.uk\">pethealthcare.co.uk</a>, an online pet information website set up by pet insurer More Than, and a directory of cat charities at <a href=\"http://www.catclub.net\">catclub.net</a> </p> <p>Cat Protection, for example, with 30 shelters and 260 voluntary branches around the country, has thousands of needy cats at any one time awaiting new homes. All animals in the charity's care are neutered (if six months old or over), de-flead, de-wormed and given a clean bill of health prior to re-homing. </p> <p>To adopt a cat, contact your nearest branch or shelter - details on <a href=\"http://www.cats.org.uk\">cats.org.uk</a> or call 08702-099-099. Once a representative has visited you at home to ensure the right cat is matched with the right home, you can choose your new pet. If you are adopting a kitten, you must sign an agreement to have it neutered at the appropriate time. </p> <p>There's no fee as such when you adopt an animal from Cats Protection, but a donation of at least \u00a320 is appreciated, given that each cat costs the charity more than \u00a3150 to care for before it is ready for rehoming. </p> <p><strong>Can you afford a kitten?</strong></p> <p>As well as the price of buying a cat in the first place, there are other expenses to take into account when deciding if you can afford to take on a kitten: </p> <p><strong>First vaccination and booster vaccination</strong> \u00a360-\u00a380 </p> <p><strong> Neutering male cat </strong> \u00a330-\u00a335 </p> <p><strong> Spaying female cat </strong> \u00a345-\u00a355 </p> <p><strong> Litter tray and other essentials approx \u00a330 </strong></p> <p><strong> Cat food and litter (per month)</strong> \u00a315-\u00a320 </p> <p><strong> Routine veterinary care (per year) approx </strong> \u00a325 </p> <p><strong> Pet insurance (per year) </strong> approx \u00a3100 </p> <p><strong> Catteries for when you go away (per day)</strong> approx \u00a36 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Figures from Cats Protection</p>",
  "<p>The tragic events of September 11 and the war on terror are largely responsible for the huge emphasis now being placed on emergency planning and disaster management. In reality, we're more likely to be affected by other 'disasters' such as flooding or extreme weather, so governments, agencies, employers and communities need to be properly trained to deal with a very broad range of risks and hazards.</p> <p>A new masters degree that aims to prepare students for global risks, hazards and disasters might be regarded in some quarters as opportunistic, but Coventry University points out that if we don't learn the lessons from disasters, the same problems will re-occur as we face new challenges.</p> <p>Coventry is home to the Centre for Disaster Management and in 1994 the university became the first in the UK to offer undergraduate courses in disaster management. Former students have gone on to work in Bangladesh, Mozambique and Ethiopia as well as for the Home Office, the Environment Agency and London Underground.</p> <p>Starting in January 2005, the taught masters degree will address the theory, principles and practice of emergency planning and disaster management. It will also examine contemporary issues such as terrorism, community based disaster management, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis and information management. The head of disaster management at Coventry is Professor David Alexander, an expert in natural hazards and disasters and a survivor of an earthquake that took place in southern Italy in 1980.</p> <p>The course, which costs \u00a33,010 and is expected to have between 15 and 20 students, can be taken full-time over one year, or part-time over three. There are five core modules, five additional modules plus a final dissertation. A postgraduate diploma may be awarded if the dissertation is not completed and a postgraduate certificate may be granted if only the five core modules are completed.</p> <p>Most students taking the course are likely to be working already in the areas of emergency planning, risk assessment, community development, humanitarian aid, capacity building or other associated professions. However, teaching staff expect some students completing the course to go on to pursue an academic or research-orientated career.</p> <p>A couple of universities offer competing MAs.

  "<p><strong> Disaffections: Complete Poems 1930-1950</strong> by Cesare Pavese, translated by Geoffrey Brock 370pp, Carcanet, \u00a314.95 <br> </p> <p>Cesare Pavese is one of those singular, disruptive poets, like Blake or Lawrence, who go against the grain - or the flow - of their culture, and for whom precedents would be as hard to find as successors. Poetry represents only part of Pavese's rich and compact achievement, which includes short stories and nine brief novels, as well as a compelling, often lacerating, journal that records his literary development from 1935 until his suicide in 1950 at the age of 42. His many translations of American novels and his critical essays opened a window during Italy's fascist years on to another, more democratic, world. </p> <p>His first poems, excluded here, are mostly flailing cris de coeur, but in 1930 he completed a poem, \"South Seas\", which pointed the way ahead, supplying him with an immense quarry for his future work, broaching a whole series of themes and, perhaps inseparable from them, a new form. Ousting the Italian hendecasyllable, it deploys a longer, flexible, anapaestic line, for which Geoffrey Brock has found a workable equivalent in English. The setting of \"South Seas\" is Pavese's native Langhe hills in Piedmont - hard, upland country where peasants eked out a living from vineyards and smallholdings. Brock loses the two explicit references to the Langhe in this poem, universalising them as \"hills\". Pavese's poems set these hills in tormented opposition to the neighbouring, industrial city of Turin, one of several taut dialectics at work in his writings. </p> <p>He kept adding poems to his first book Lavorare Stanca, ( Work's Tiring ) in the manner of Leaves of Grass or Les Fleurs du Mal, two works he particularly admired. The title itself is a provocation to the fascist regime that stressed the dignity of labour in its official art. (One contemporary postage stamp portrays a labourer towering over his plough with the stirring motto: \"Why Italy has bread for all its children.\") Pavese's poems address the indignities of labour - where it's to be had - and otherwise the bitterness of unemployment, and bread and sustenance are far from plentiful for either the peasants of the hills or the proletariat of Turin. </p> <p>His poems select lives and stories that are anything but shining advertisements for the fascist state, a cast of marginals and misfits - prostitutes, the unemployed, winos, drifters, prisoners, thieves. He portrays a dystopic Italy with blood on its streets, its homesteads ruled by incestuous fathers. That Pavese's first book should have passed so unscathed (only four of its poems fell foul of Mussolini's censor) is a testimony to how mildly, or else inattentively, that office was undertaken. </p> <p>In his diary, Pavese describes the way he evolved what he variously calls \"poesia-racconto\" (poem-story) and \"immagine-racconto\" (image-story). This latter term takes us closer to his procedures. Often two images are constellated or merged, as in \"Atlantic Oil\" where the first line - \"The drunk mechanic is happy to be in the ditch\" - already suggests the two liquids, alcohol and petrol, that will govern the poem's progress. The mechanic dreams of producing his own wine in the future, but his present is lived in the thirsty summer dust raised by the passing cars, themselves thirsting for petrol. At the poem's heart lies a typically sensuous perception - </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\"It's a pleasure to spend the morning in the shade,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;where the stink of oil's cut with the smell of green,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;of tobacco, of wine...<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;- once more bringing the two vital fluids into co-relation or exchange.\"</p> <p>\"Two Cigarettes\" is another poem subtly articulated around a central image. It describes the meeting of a client with a prostitute under the streetlamps. In Italy prostitutes are sometimes referred to as \"lucciole\" (fireflies) because their presence is signalled by the flare of a cigarette end. Although the word itself is never used, it is suggested throughout the poem: the wind in the opening lines is called \"lucido\" and the conversation is punctuated by references to the cigarettes they smoke: \"Two butts, now, on the asphalt...\" The cigarettes give a promise of brief, creaturely pleasure, and there's a human warmth to this poem rare among the earlier poems as the two figures leave the scene, crossing \"the street, arm in arm, playfully warming each other\". </p> <p>Pavese's language is a stark vernacular, sparsely flecked with dialect (as if to avoid too much literary \"colour\") and resolutely bare like the hills he describes in poem after poem. He makes this connection himself in \"South Seas\" in describing the speech of his returned friend: </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\"He told me all this, not in Italian,<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; but in the slow dialect of these parts, which, like the rocks<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; right here on this hill, is so rugged and hard<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; that two decades of foreign tongues and oceans<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; never scratched its surface . . . </p> <p>His language and syntax would seem to offer few obstacles to the translator. Yet the irregular geometry of his dependent clauses tends to lay the phrases at odd angles to each other until the end of the sentence resolves or at least realigns them. Much depends also on the resonance of his final lines, which often reinscribe the whole poem's trajectory, while deftly avoiding the epigrammatic. </p> <p>Though much of his writing is obdurately opposed to the values of Mussolini's Italy, and though he was jailed and sent into internal exile in Brancaleone, Pavese is not a straightforwardly political poet. His tough, inclusive vision, however, and his refusal to turn away from human misery give his writings an additional, almost documentary, value. In \"Fallen Women\" he begins: </p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;People are right to treat them like that.<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It's certainly better than pitying them<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;in your heart before you enjoy them in bed. </p> <p>The poem returns to this idea: \"Pity was always a waste of time. / Existence is terrible, pity won't change that. / It's better to keep quiet, jaws clenched.\" A tension is generated in his writing by a drive \"to keep quiet\" and the urgency of his need to describe. Other elements in his writing, however, are not so fundamentally at odds with the regime, notably his misogyny. Paradoxically, his poems often investigate the actual condition of women's lives and even, in several cases, manage with terse empathy to depict the memories and the state of mind of prostitutes. </p> <p>In Brock's translation some problems occur with what language teachers call \"false friends\". In \"Landowners\", he turns the phrase \"la gente che rantola \" into \"ranting patients\", though the verb means gasp, as in death-throes. In the same poem \"le cure\" of the priest attending the dying does not, in this case, mean \"his cures\" but rather the things he has to do. Elsewhere \"rubando le zuche\" means \"stealing the pumpkins\" not \"filling his gourds\". There are other slips of this order, but these don't detract from the solid merits of the translation, which is the best, and the most ample, in English to date. </p> <p>Pavese's poems could be accused of a certain narrowness - a lack of humour and variety in tone and language. Even some of his images - his hills and streetlamps - can become over-insistent, while his favoured trope of dog and bitch to describe human sexuality is as bleakly reductive as late Tolstoy. And yet his marvellously peopled poems not only document the time - what Calvino called \"the Pavese era\" - but also bear witness to a unique and restless intelligence. </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong>Jamie McKendrick's most recent book of poems is Ink Stone.

  "<p>The Chequebook and the Cruise Missile: Conversations with Arundhati Roy (Harper Perennial, \u00a38.99) </p> <p>Roy argues that her Booker prize-winning novel The God of Small Things was just as political as this series of interviews; just as she has always aimed to connect the very smallest to the very biggest, to show \"how history and politics intrude into your life, your house, your bedroom ... to create links, to join the dots, to tell politics like a story\". Her conversations with journalist David Barsamian bring Roy's clarity and lyricism to an analysis of new forms of imperialism and the globalisation of dissent. The chequebook represents Argentina's collapse, the cruise missile Iraq's: they are connected, Roy argues, through US-dominated attempts to force open and control global markets. Whether discussing hydroelectrics or call centres, the stories told in these four lengthy interviews are sparky and knowledgeable: not for nothing has Roy become a goddess of the global justice movement. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p> <strong> Where I Was From, by Joan Didion (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>California, of course. Or rather, a sequence of Californias, each of which was an imagined construct that in fact changed the landscape - the dams built to store the water in which to grow the rice that Americans didn't eat and Japanese wouldn't import, the pioneer ranches subsectioned into unreal estate to house the workers for the aerospace industry that serviced military fantasies ... Didion's voice is less incantatory than it was when she \"wrote herself a Californian river\" in her first novel, Run River . She's more prepared to challenge her own false memories as well as everyone else's. There are the familiars of her writing - rattlesnakes, Patty Hearst, the Donner party wagon train; and then there is the unfamiliar death of her mother, from which no moving-on is possible, not even for a native Californian. \"There is no real way to deal with everything we lose.\" <strong>A Writer's World: Travels 1950-2000 by Jan Morris (Faber, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> \"I am by nature an outsider, by profession an onlooker, by inclination a loner,\" Jan Morris declares as she looks back over 50 years of travelling. During that time she has brought her distinctive style of detached curiosity to bear on some of the defining events of the century, from her first journalistic scoop on the ascent of Everest, to an eyewitness account of Eichmann's trial, and the British empire's final curtain in Hong Kong. But even as she records these seismic moments, her eye is drawn to the \"flash of underlife\" - the swarm of child thieves on Rio's streets, the inscrutable Aborigines living in the crimson shadow of Ayers Rock, the angry swagger of youths in Soweto townships - that reveals the true character of time or place. Morris's prose adapts itself to the unique contours of each city. In an age in which we travel to \"find ourselves\", this collection reminds us of the value of elsewhere. <strong>LB</strong></p> <p><strong> Our Final Century, by Martin Rees (Arrow, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Grey goo. Giant waves wiping out western Europe. Trouble-makers releasing designer viruses. \"Stranglets\" ripping the very fabric of space ... One for panic junkies and amateur futurologists alike, Sir Martin Rees's book runs through a variety of ways in which we might all be doomed. Surveying current thinking across a range of scientific fields, the chapters vary in sophistication; as expected from the astronomer royal, those on cosmology are the most interesting, presenting their mind-bending possibilities with poetical lucidity. When not considering moves to Mars, parallel universes or the threat of asteroids, Rees is clear on what he sees as our present dangers: bioterror, global warming and overpopulation, making the possibility of this being \"our final century\" a very real one. Consequently, he lambasts society's short-termism (comically exemplified by the fact that in the US this book is published as Our Final Hour ). <strong> JL</strong> </p> <p><strong> Signs &amp; Wonders, by Marina Warner (Vintage, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>This is a cabinet of curiosities, literary niches for the display of peculiarities - a Madonna statue in Pantano, Italy, that dried its tears once it had a fundraising website; the shifting, difficult life of Indian Warner of Trinidad, who might have been a beloved slave or disavowed son of a liaison between the governor and a Carib. It is rich with rum, bananas and sex (a terrific critique of the other Madonna); and money - an inquiry into the relationship of the felled Twin Towers of New York with the legendary snake-entwined Pillars of Hercules at the mouth of the Mediterranean, by way of pieces of eight and the dollar sign; and it takes in Dante and parrots, too. The essay of veneration to King Kong - primevally magnificent onscreen, offscreen 18 inches high and covered in rabbit fur - balances cinema racism, beastism and Shakespeare studies. As ever with Warner, my gob was robustly, repeatedly smacked. <strong> VR</strong> </p> <p><strong>Atlantic Britain, by Adam Nicolson (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>While some men splash out on motorbikes, Nicolson responds to his mid-life crisis by buying a boat and plunging heart-first into a passionate affair with the sea. In the company of his stalwart skipper George, he embarks on a voyage around western Britain. Nicolson is invigorated and intoxicated by the boundless possibilities of his quest. More than just an adrenaline-lashed yarn of physical survival, this is also a spiritual and emotional odyssey. By the time Nicolson abandons George to complete the homeward stretch of the journey alone, it is clear that he has failed the real test of seamanship: \"Come on, Adam, help me. Don't just keep saying how fantastic the waves are.\" Luckily for the reader, the qualities that make Nicolson an infuriating crew-member and a difficult husband also make for buoyant and lyrical prose, resulting in a shimmering - and surprisingly vulnerable - testimonial to the allure of the sea.

  "<p>The man, Francis, 34, and trying to be more considerate in life and mind, passed another man as he entered the bathroom. The second man's name we will never know, and come to think of it, he wasn't even a man. He was a man-child. A teen-man. Francis was teaching a class in a university building, and a teen leadership conference was being held that day, and the man Francis passed in the bathroom was young, maybe 17, and was clearly a participant in this conference. When Francis entered the bathroom, the teenager, wiping his hands on a brown paper towel, said \"Hello\" to Francis in a clear, confident, future-leader sort of way. In response, Francis meant to say \"Hey there\" back to him, cheerfully because he was happy to be greeted this cold Saturday morning, but his words came out in a whisper, or something less than that. And then the teen was gone, out the door, leaving Francis on the cold black toilet seat, flustered and wondering and cursing himself. Why had his voice failed him? If the young man had not heard his whispered hello, how would this young man feel? Francis hated moments like this, and tried with all of his heart and might to avoid them, these tiny moments of seeming slight. Each and every time Francis was granted any courtesy, any surprising kindness, he would give - was utterly committed to giving - back tenfold. When someone returned a dime he'd dropped, he would thank them and thank them, chasing them down the street to thank them. But now he had failed - he'd been volleyed, if you will, the shuttlecock of human kindness and had neglected to tap it back. It was so easy, so incredibly easy, to thwock that shuttlecock over that low, sagging net of reciprocity, but he couldn't do even that. And what would the young man, a future leader, take from this? That older people are unfriendly, are embittered and unwilling to accept and return and spread goodwill? Of course that was the message; it was clear and loud. The rest was inevitable. This young man would return to his leadership conference and begin plotting. Ten years on, he would be running the country or the world with his leadership-conference buddies, and at some global summit of cherubic young go-getters, he would remember the sour, unhappy man in the basement bathroom, and would see no alternative - damn, damn, damn that film Logan's Run and its all-too-sensical solutions! - but to have all citizens killed before their 30th birthday. The under-30 people of the future-world, all equally tired of haggard older faces and their murmurs and mumbles and general malaise, would be all too happy to be done with all of them. And it would be the fault of Francis - all because he couldn't muster an audible hello. It wouldn't have taken much - the bathroom was covered in tile! Francis, you bastard, he thought, as he sat on the cold black toilet, if you ate more fibre, you wouldn't have this much time to think, which was entirely too much.</p>",
  "<p>To arrive at a true understanding of Anne Stevenson's poetry, you have to go deep. In fact, the Deep is a very good place to start. Jutting into the Humber estuary like a vast steel fin, the Deep is Hull's impressive new aquatic attraction - where you expect to find tropical fish rather than topical poetry - yet the first thing the visitor sees, before descending to the bottom of Europe's deepest tank, is a line by Stevenson: \"The sea is as near as we come to another world.\" </p> <p>It is from \"North Sea Off Carnoustie\", though there is something about the poet herself that also belongs to another world. Stevenson lives at the top of one of the steepest hills in Durham, and does much of her writing in north Wales, but her work and demeanour speak strongly of her New England origins. One can sense the puritan influence in the poems, which are as meticulously crafted as pieces of Shaker furniture. One can sense it in her conversation, which is forthright, economical and even-handed, and even see it in her haircut, unchanged from adolescence. </p> <p>\"She has a candour and assurance about her that I think is purely American,\" says the poet and novelist Helen Dunmore. \"There's a clarity about the way she talks, even the way she looks, that is quintessentially New England.\" Poet laureate Andrew Motion, a friend and admirer of Stevenson since the early 1970s, places her in \"the lineage of puritan women poets that extends from Emily Dickinson to Elizabeth Bishop and Sylvia Plath\"; while the American poet, novelist and critic Jay Parini thinks of her \"as a contemporary Emily Dickinson, a poet who works on a small canvas, quietly, with big themes\". </p> <p>The story of how a major American poet came to settle, almost unnoticed, in the north-east of England is convoluted, involving four marriages, 15 volumes of poetry and many Atlantic crossings. For those unfamiliar with her poems, she is perhaps best known as author of Bitter Fame, the acclaimed biography of her contemporary, Plath. Her latest volume, A Report From the Border (2003), brought the first major prize of her career, the Northern Rock Foundation Writer's Award, at 70. \"Looking back at it now,\" she says, \"any objective account of my life is bound to read like a cross between The Wife of Bath's Tale and a travel brochure.\" An edition of her Collected Poems , that will include 20 new ones, is planned for next year, and she is working too on a long poem based on Piers Plowman and \"the rhythms of medieval lyrics. \"Peter Redgrove, whose poetry I admire, is its central character, a kind of Virgil who, in a dream, leads me into an underworld of former poets.\" </p> <p>In poetry circles, Stevenson has never wanted for admirers. A celebratory volume, published in honour of her 70th year, attracted tributes from virtually every leading figure of the poetry establishment, yet her talent has often been eclipsed. She would be the most notable literary alumnus of the University of Michigan, were it not for Arthur Miller; the foremost American woman poet of her generation, were it not for Plath. Today she might enjoy a far greater profile among the poetry-reading public were it not for her indifference to self-promotion on the literary circuit. \"I've cancelled all my subscriptions to poetry magazines,\" she says. \"I prefer to read the New Scientist. My trouble is that I don't relate very well to today's popular idea of what a poet should be. I never wanted to be a pop star.\" She has agreed to take part in a round-table event in Newcastle on National Poetry Day next Thursday (\"it would seem curmudgeonly not to\"), but says: \"I truly hate marketing promotions, and I don't at all approve of encouraging wannabe poets to write bad poetry.\" </p> <p>\"It mystifies me when a poet of Anne Stevenson's stature seems to be marginalised,\" says Neil Astley, her publisher at Bloodaxe, \"but it also speaks of her artistic independence, her individuality, and her refusal to play along with the system.\" Dunmore agrees: \"She was a major role model for women poets of my generation, and it frustrates me that she is not better known.\" </p> <p>Stevenson's self-imposed exile is only partly explained by her ambivalence towards the world of workshops and competitions. She has suffered acute, progressive hearing loss, which makes her increasingly uncomfortable in large groups, though her response to her disability has been typically pragmatic. She summed up the experience in a pithy, four-line poem, \"On Going Deaf\": </p> <p>I've lost a sense. Why should I care? </p> <p>Searching myself, I find a spare. </p> <p>I keep that sixth sense in repair </p> <p>And set it deftly, like a snare. </p> <p>\"It is a particularly cruel irony that someone like Anne should be afflicted with hearing loss,\" says Dunmore, \"because her distinct quality as a poet is her remarkable ear.\" The poet and critic John Lucas points to the musicality of Stevenson's work: \"Her cadences are almost entirely musical - even the pauses are like rests within a bar rather than punctuation within a sentence.\" Stevenson says that \"almost always it is some overheard musical rhythm or phrase which sets me writing\", and, until her late teens, she assumed that she was destined to be a musician rather than a poet. </p> <p>\"Every house I can remember living in had two pianos and no furniture,\" she says. \"I can't recall my father ever entering the house without immediately sitting down to the piano. We always played chamber music as a family. My sister and I knew every Beethoven sonata note for note.\" A rousing glimpse of this hectic, musical household is contained in \"Arioso Dolente\": </p> <p>Father, who ran downstairs as I practised the piano; </p> <p>barefooted, buttoning his shirt, he shouted \"G, </p> <p>D-natural, C-flat! Dolente, arioso. </p> <p>Put all the griefs of the world in that change of key.\" </p> <p>As a musician, Charles Stevenson remained no more than a talented amateur. He built his career around his other great passion, philosophy. \"Steve\", as he was known, met Stevenson's mother, Louise Destler, at high school in Cincinnati. They married in 1930, after he graduated from Yale and she from Wooster College, Ohio, where her mother had been one of the first American women to go to college. Almost immediately they set sail for Cambridge, England, where Steve studied with Wittgenstein and GE Moore, whose demolition of German metaphysics had a deep impact on him, though he was less impressed with Wittgenstein's method of lecturing from a deckchair in a darkened room. In a house on Midsummer Common, on January 3 1933, Anne was born; barely six months later her father enrolled at Harvard graduate school and the family set sail for the other Cambridge, establishing the pattern of shuttling across the Atlantic that Stevenson was to follow for the rest of her life. </p> <p>She spent her first six years in Boston, until the family (including a sister, Diana, two years her junior) moved again to New Haven, where Steve took up a lecturing position at Yale. Stevenson recalls that, even from an early age, having a philosopher for a father was a special distinction: \"On my first day at school in New Haven,\" she says, \"we were all asked what our fathers did for a living. All the other children said 'policeman', 'businessman', 'lawyer' and so forth. I said: 'philosopher'. My class instructor looked a bit taken aback, and asked if I meant that he was a teacher. So I puffed myself up and said: 'No - he's a heterologician'.\" </p> <p>In 1944, her father published Ethics and Language, whose principal argument - that everything we believe is conditioned by language - was not lost on the future poet. Though now acknowledged as a landmark, the book prompted his dismissal from the philosophy faculty at Yale. \"He refused to acknowledge the existence of absolute evil,\" explains Stevenson. \"It was not a popular position during the war with Hitler.\" </p> <p>While Steve cut a somewhat abstracted figure - Stevenson recalls that he would float off from the dinner table \"into a fond, philosophical problem\" - her mother was more down-to-earth. In \"Arioso Dolente\", Stevenson pays tribute to: \"Mother, who read and thought and poured herself into me; / she was the jug and I was the two-eared cup.\" </p> <p>\"I grew up in a family of extremely strong women,\" Stevenson says. \"They may not have been accorded much status in society, but in the home they were dominant. My mother was an extremely creative woman - she wrote novels that she never published - but ultimately she diverted all her creative energies into the work of art she was determined to make of her family. </p> <p>\"My mother always read to us - Dickens, Dumas, Scott, Hugo - and I believed in them so intensely that by the time I went to school I had little idea where make-believe ended and real life began.\" </p> <p>In the elaborate fantasy world that Stevenson began to fashion for herself, there was no question she should become anything other than a famous musician. She took piano lessons from a former pupil of Prokofiev, and made elaborate plans for her discovery: \"I was so determined to be seen as a second Mozart or Schubert that I hatched a plan to leave a basement window of the local church open after Brownies, so that I could slip in at dead of night and be discovered improvising at the keyboard. I really did sneak in in my nightclothes, with a candle. In the end it was probably just as well that the organ loft was locked.\" </p> <p>In 1946, the family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the same year that a third daughter, Laura, was born. Steve took up an associate professorship at the University of Michigan, while Anne attended the university high school. It was here, in10th grade, that she wrote her first real poem: \"Just a few lines which suddenly came to me after I spotted the flash of a red-winged blackbird by one of Michigan's small lakes. Real poems have mostly arrived unbidden like this ever since: caught in the corner of my eye like that bird.\" </p> <p>It was significant that these first stirrings of poetry should be felt at the time her musical ambitions were about to collapse. In 1950, she enrolled in the music school of the University of Michigan, majoring in the cello. \"It was a huge disappointment to discover that I really wasn't very good. I could have stuck it out, and practised eight hours a day, but I withdrew as I could not settle for being no more than mediocre.\" She switched to European history and literature, and intensified her determination to write. \"Auden wanted to be an engineer when it was clear he was really a poet who thought about engineering,\" she says. \"It became apparent I was really a poet who thought about music.\" </p> <p>At 20, she decided she had \"had enough of being a Stevenson daughter\", and began looking for potential partners. Her search coincided with the reappearance of Robin Hitchcock, an Englishman who had lived with the family in New Haven as an evacuee during the second world war. Meeting again as young adults appealed to her sense of narrative. \"I felt like I was living in a story,\" she says, though the plot was soon to develop, \"if not into tragedy exactly, then certainly a mess.\" </p> <p>On graduating from Michigan, she flew to England to begin her new life with her husband in Cambridge. She found the country \"cold and shabby and tired after the war. People didn't particularly take to you if you were American and supposedly had all these advantages.\" More problematic was the fact that the newlyweds rapidly realised they were incompatible: \"I was an aesthete, an intellectual and, as I can see now, the protected, much-hovered-over elder daughter of highly protective parents. Robin was a businessman, a risk-taker, especially with money. I was very attracted by that. But ultimately he had no interest in the arts whatsoever.\" </p> <p>She discovered domestic life to be stifling and, particularly after her daughter Caroline was born, she had increasingly little time to write. \"I hit rock bottom,\" she says, \"skeletally thin, unable to eat or read, constantly tearful.\" The great irony was that as she stumbled into a creative block, great poetic events were unfolding in her mother-in-law's kitchen. Helen Hitchcock was a widowed vicar's wife who, to make ends meet, packed bohemian students into every available corner of her home, St Botolph's Rectory. A young Tennesseean, Lucas Myers, lived in the former chicken shed at the bottom of the garden, and occasionally provided shelter for his friend, Ted Hughes. In 1956, Myers, Hughes and others published a literary magazine, and named it the St Botolph's Review. It was at its launch party that Hughes met Plath. </p> <p>Stevenson felt the extreme frustration of realising a poetic revolution was taking place without her. \"Robin disapproved. He used to shepherd me away from the 'roistering poets', as he called them. I lacked the courage and the self-confidence to argue. But I thought: 'what if I want to be a roistering poet myself?'\" She could sense an alarming pattern developing. Her mother had suppressed her creative ambitions to bring up a family, and Stevenson was determined not to make the same sacrifice. Her response was to flee, with her daughter, to Ireland, where she took refuge with a friend of her mother's in County Clare. </p> <p>\"Luba Kaftanikoff was a round little spinster, half-poet, half-white witch, who had known Yeats. She took me for a drive to see Lady Gregory's former home in Coole Park. This was where I met a white donkey and became convinced that it embodied the soul of Yeats. We communed for a while, and I came away determined that I should cut away from any life that precluded the writing of poetry.\" </p> <p>She divorced Robin and returned to America, enrolling as a graduate student in English at the University of Michigan. Here she fell under the influence of the poet and teacher Donald Hall, who restored her damaged sense of confidence in herself as a person and as a poet. Yet, with a strange sense of circularity, the next person she fell in love with was an Englishman and a friend of the family, the brilliant sinologist, Mark Elvin. They married, had two sons (John, born 1966 and Charles born 1967) and moved to Britain, where Elvin held teaching posts in Cambridge, Glasgow and Oxford. Stevenson held a fellowship at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, and began to meet and mix with a generation of younger poets, one of whom was Motion. </p> <p>\"Anne promoted a pioneering programme of readings at the Old Fire Station Arts Centre,\" says Motion, \"and we began to meet and exchange drafts. She was instrumental in getting my first collection, The Pleasure Steamers, off the ground. We found a wavelength because she was interested, as I was, in expanding the scope of lyric poetry, and we had long discussions as to what a lyric poem might be.\" </p> <p>In fact, Stevenson had begun to expand the scope of lyric poetry exponentially, with her long narrative poem \"Correspondences\" (1973). A historical saga of a New England family in letters, prose and verse - she fondly refers to it as \"my 19th-century novel - the poem was pieced together painfully over two, tempestuous years in which her marriage to Elvin foundered. It is a heartfelt farewell to her mother, who died of cancer in 1963, and also the poem with which she \"finally cut the umbilical cord to the America my parents taught me to believe in\": </p> <p>So I cry and cry and then </p> <p>wish there were some way to justify </p> <p>the release of it. </p> <p>For it's not for her particular death, </p> <p>but for what dies with her. </p> <p>Something that calls </p> <p>For our abduction </p> <p>out of things. Nostalgia </p> <p>for expended generations. </p> <p>Her second marriage over, Stevenson met, and was briefly married to Michael Farley, a poet 15 years her junior. The drama of this intense, competitive relationship was played out in the literary town of Hay-on-Wye, where they attempted, with fitting irony, to establish a poetry bookshop in a former morgue. </p> <p>\"It was nuts,\" she recalls, \"two people with no business sense whatsoever attempting to get along, with our combined families, in tiny living quarters above the shop. Looking back on it, it seems as if we behaved like naughty children on holiday from school. We once received a government grant to bring over a group of Yugoslav poets, which we thought was a marvellously progressive idea. I had no understanding that the Serbs would not get on with the Croats, and the Bosnians would not get along with anybody. The only way to resolve the political differences was to spend the entire grant on brandy.\" </p> <p>Her appointment as Northern Arts Literary Fellow in 1981 brought her for the first time to the north-east, with which she fell in love, and which has been her home ever since. In 1987 she married the Darwin scholar Peter Lucas (\"my last marriage\", she says emphatically) and commenced work on Bitter Fame, believing that \"a quiet, new grandmotherly chapter of my life was about to begin\". </p> <p>\"I think marriage to Peter Lucas has been absolutely invaluable to Anne,\" says John Lucas (no relation), a close friend. \"She has always been ill at ease with domesticity, and I wonder if the leaving of her various relationships has been because her development as an artist needed that spur of displacement.\" </p> <p>\"I have never blamed any of my husbands for the collapse of three marriages,\" says Stevenson. \"It was certainly my fault as much as theirs. I was an uncompromising, difficult person to live with - and hopeless with the children. But I would never have got married three times if it had seemed socially acceptable to live with a partner first. I suppose that's the puritan streak in me asserting itself again - I thought it morally reprehensible not to be married.\" </p> <p>If she assumed marriage to Lucas would usher in a quiet, settled phase, she had not foreseen the furore that accompanied the publication of Bitter Fame in 1989. It was the first Plath study to apportion equal blame in the failure of the relationship with Hughes. Plath scholars were outraged - one rival biographer declared it the worst book she had ever read. John Lucas recalls the time as \"a disaster for Anne - that book cost her far more than the three years of her life she took to write it\". The book's reception wounded her deeply, and she resolved never to write another biography. </p> <p>\"Bitter Fame had the misfortune to come out when the Plath industry was still engaged in hurling things over the barricades,\" says Motion, \"but the book's great strength was that it showed Anne's ability, as with all her work, to ignore common wisdom and received opinion and cut through to the sense of things.\" </p> <p>Janet Malcolm's overview of Plath scholarship, The Silent Woman (1994), assessed Bitter Fame to be \"by far the most intelligent, and the only authentically satisfying\" of all Plath biographies. But it was not until Hughes's unexpected decision to break his silence with the publication in 1998 of Birthday Letters, the poetic chronicle of his relationship with Plath, that Stevenson's account of the relationship was more generally vindicated. Stevenson has written that \"with the publication of Birthday Letters, it was as if the literary world suddenly woke up to find the balance between the two poets restored\". </p> <p>It has remained, however, a source of deep frustration to Stevenson that her notoriety as a biographer should overshadow her achievement as a poet. In a valedictory poem, \"Letter to Sylvia Plath\", she hails her contemporary as \"the fiercest poet of our time\", but concludes: \"My shoulder does not like your claw.\" \"I think Sylvia Plath was important to Anne long before she wrote the biography,\" says Motion. \"You can hear that pure, Plath-like clarity in her lyrics - by that I do not mean to suggest they are derivative, but that there are such close similarities between the two poets' careers. They were both bold, New England women who came to make a name for themselves as poets in this country, at the same time as struggling to bring up a family. And you could say that Anne was the stronger and more successful of the two - she survived.\" </p> <p>Stevenson's two most recent collections, Granny Scarecrow (2000) and last year's A Report From the Border, contain some of her most profound work and Stevenson believes they may represent the culmination of her career. \"As a poet, I find myself writing in phases. I felt that those two volumes constituted one such period, which seemed to be a summation of everything I had to say. As one ages one acquires the ability to perceive the world with an increased sense of perspective. It becomes increasingly evident that one is not, after all, the centre of the universe. It's quite a liberation actually, when one's own ego no longer blocks the view.\" More recently she has been working on the libretto for a \"feminist opera\" which she says is also a satire on feminist dogma. She has also made several attempts at fiction. </p> <p>Stevenson's daughter Caroline, who has worked as a photographer and teacher, now lives in Bristol where she pilots a ferry on the Waterfront. Her son John is a biochemist, while Charles has travelled widely and works in personnel. She has four grandchildren. \"I think it is very rare for a poet to actually get better with age,\" says Dunmore, \"but I think Anne does. Recently, she has written about the experience of ageing with a candour and honesty unparalleled in contemporary poetry.\" </p> <p>Neither wholly British, nor completely American, Stevenson's oeuvre might be better known if it were easier to place. \"I suspect she never quite receives her due because the American establishment regards her as a British poet, while the British think she's American,\" suggests Astley. Parini agrees: \"Americans are very suspicious of anything British when it comes to poetry. There is a sense that she has been out of the country too long. She is subtle and profound, with a quiet grace of spirit, yet these qualities necessarily make her a poet for a smallish audience.\" </p> <p>Asked whether she regards herself as British or American, Stevenson replies, with characteristic irony, that she feels equally disenchanted with both. \"I belong to an America which no longer really exists. The New England part of me is the best part - puritan values: feet-on-the-ground, rationality, common sense. I don't identify with the consumerism of modern America, the short-termism, the sanctification of success. Globalisation has made the world such a tiny place that it seems increasingly irrelevant to say whether I'm English or American: we both appear to be eating out of the same trough.\" </p> <p>Motion points out that \"she has never lost that sense of being on the edge of things, artistically and geographically, and maybe she needs to remain peripheral because that is where the clarity and perspective of her art come from.\" Stevenson accepts that her transient life and avoidance of the mainstream may have been a conscious decision. \"Ever since I can remember I have been aware of living at what EM Forster called 'a slight angle' to the universe,\" she says. \"I have always had to create my own angular environment or perish.\" As she proceeds through her 70s, she remains a quiet, but significant voice from the border. \"But that's the whole point about borders,\" she says. \"It's the best place from which to be able to see both sides.\" </p> <p><strong> Anne Stevenson</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Born: </strong> January 3 1933, Cambridge. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> University High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan; University of Michigan. </p> <p><strong> Family:</strong> 1955-60 Robin Hitchcock (one daughter, Caroline); '63-79 Mark Elvin (two sons, John and Charles); '79-80 Michael Farley; '87- Peter Lucas. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> 1973 Literary Fellow, Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford; '81-82 Northern Arts Literary Fellow; '89 writer-in-residence Edinburgh University. </p> <p><strong> Some poetry:</strong> 1969 Reversals; '74 Correspondences; '87 Selected Poems; '96 Collected Poems 1955-1995; 2000 Granny Scarecrow; '03 A Report from the Border. </p> <p><strong> Some books: </strong> 1966<strong> </strong> Elizabeth Bishop; '89 Bitter Fame; '98 Between the Iceberg and the Ship: Selected Essays, Five Looks at Elizabeth Bishop. </p> <p><strong> Awards: </strong> 2003 Northern Rock Foundation Award. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anne Stevenson is taking part in A Feast of Poetry, hosted by Julia Darling at the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne next Thursday at 7.30 pm. <a href=\"http://www.litandphil.org.uk\">www.litandphil.org.uk</a>, <strong> 0191 232 0192</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>One of the by-products of looking through archives is a kind of artificial clairvoyance: you know what is going to happen next. Sandwiched between some loose papers in the archives of the British photographer Tony Ray-Jones at the Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television in Bradford was a page from one of those old-fashioned desk calendars, the sort that gets torn off as each day goes by. A large red figure eight and the full date, 7/8/64, Wednesday July 8 1964; the reversed day and month indicated America. On the flip side were a few scribbled notes about how best to expose Pan-X film \"for detail\". Most of the other sheets contained lists, scribbled in swift capitals: \"Some Story Ideas: Sunnyside Colony, Queens (German folk dancing etc), Festival of Flowers (call Buddhist temple), Gypsies and Gypsy weddings, Abyssinian Church Uptown - Fashion show (negro audience), People trapped in small environment - elevators (before door closes), Invisible people - shoe-shiners in Gnd Central, Women who live out of bags, People in Supermarkets - stop them and shoot yell stop. Bus terminals - Make people automatons.\" </p> <p>Among \"some places to photograph\" were Idlewild airport, Fulton fish market on the Lower East Side, East Harlem, Chinatown, St Christopher's Arena \"midgets backstage\", Central Park and Coney Island. It was the hectic schedule of a young British photographer in his first year in New York. The lists aren't dated, but they must have been made before the end of 1963, when Idlewild airport was renamed to commemorate the death of John F Kennedy. By this time Ray-Jones would have been in America for two years, studying for a Master of Fine Arts in graphic design at Yale. After graduating in the summer of 1964, he found a short-lived job as an art director at CBS records, but he was determined to become a photographer. The country he had left behind was still recovering from the second world war, but New York was buzzing with newness. He kept his programme for the US premiere of Stockhausen's Originale in September 1964 at the Judson Hall, with \"action music\" by the artist Nam June Paik and poetry by Allen Ginsberg, just as he kept scraps of paper on which he'd jotted down music stores offering cheap deals on jazz: 50 cents off Horace Silver's Blowin' The Blues Away at Sam Goody's, a dollar off Ray Charles on Atlantic at Korvette's, half-price Blue Note albums at Kenny's. </p> <p>\"You know, Tony loved America intensely, and he loved it for its music,\" Joel Meyerowitz said. \"He was feverish about music and photography. But he was very English about it, always muttering a lot, 'We've got to keep working ...' He was incredibly impatient.\" </p> <p>Meyerowitz is now one of America's most famous photographic artists, but 40 years ago he spent two years of intense friendship with Ray-Jones, roaming the streets and taking photographs. \"Every Saturday there would be ethnic parades, St Patrick's day, Polish day, Columbus day, veterans' day. We used these parades as a laboratory. We learned to be invisible. We learned how to shape pictures that were not about an event but about an observation.\" </p> <p>The streets of New York represented fertile territory for documentary photographers, from Weegee and William Klein to Robert Frank, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand - a new generation of photographers whose aim, in the words of John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art, \"has been not to reform life but to know it\". Ray-Jones and Meyerowitz were fired up by what was going on around them. \"Bresson was very important to both of us,\" Meyerowitz said. \"We were in love with him, and with Robert Frank.\" And then there was Winogrand, who made \"the freest, loosest, open-ended, open-hearted, generous pictures about life\". </p> <p>\"Those were precious years,\" Meyerowitz said. \"Every day was a discovery. It was wonderful having a partner who said, 'We've got to keep working. We can't let this crap that we're producing keep us down.' We loved each other in the way that two guys on the edge of discovery love each other, and we had the raw medium between us.\" Which is why the discovery of the calendar page generated a sudden poignancy. Because with it came the realisation that on July 8 1964, Ray-Jones was a month past his 23rd birthday, burning with plans for the future, and in less than 10 years he would be dead. His photographic career spanned little more than a decade. His five years in America were followed by five more in England, from 1966 to 1971. There was a brief return to America, teaching in San Francisco, before he fell ill and returned to London, where he died of leukaemia in March 1972. \"There's a thing about those people,\" Meyerowitz said, \"those people who have brilliant creative minds and who died at 30. They did it in those 10 years - the clock is running and they're burning their metabolism at a certain rate. There was that sense with Tony.\" </p> <p>Ray-Jones was born in Somerset in 1941. His father, Raymond Ray-Jones, was an engraver whose work was collected in the British Museum and the V&amp;A. He died before Tony was a year old, and his mother with her three sons moved in with her parents and worked as a physiotherapist. Ray-Jones went to school at Christ's Hospital, in West Sussex, then enrolled on a graphic design course at the London School of Printing, where Rolf Brandt, Bill Brandt's brother, encouraged his photography. He left England on a scholarship for Yale in 1961 before \"the 60s\" as we know it had even begun. He came back in 1966 to find London swinging, but the rest of Britain still clearly divided by class and tradition. He left behind only one book, but his role as both inspiration and an irritant to a British photographic community which, as far as he was concerned, was barely conscious, compared with America's, ensured his place in the history of British photography. He inspired the generation that followed him to observe the society around them, as its values shifted under Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>In the summer of 1966 he came across a Country Life book of Old English Customs. The description of traditional rural pastimes excited him and he began to conceive of a book about the English. The last such subjective survey by a photographer had been Bill Brandt's The English At Home, published in 1936. It was time for an update. </p> <p>Back in London that autumn, he met Anna Coates, an art student from St Helens. They moved into a flat in Gloucester Place, where Ray-Jones built a darkroom and, amid visitors from America, including Meyerowitz, Winogrand, the jazz pianist Horace Silver, John Szarkowski, continued to develop his new project. A Day Off - An English Journal, a collection of photographs he took between 1967 and 1970, was published posthumously in 1974. </p> <p>He and Anna bought a VW camper van and started to make weekend trips. \"We drove off to the seaside, or to a festival,\" she said. \"Tony did a lot of research with the English Folklore Society, with various tourist boards, with visitors' information centres at various seaside resorts. He plotted things out. He was quite well organised.\" </p> <p>In 1964, at Yale, Ray-Jones had attended a lecture by Walker Evans, who showed not his own photographs but his collection of American postcards. Ray-Jones now began to collect postcards of England, including the rude seaside postcards by Donald McGill. He made lists of books to read, from The Butlin Story, to Veblen's The Theory Of The Leisure Class, to Jane Austen's unfinished novel, Sanditon. His calendar of upcoming events included women's bowls in Bournemouth in July, Britain's baby of the year in Blackpool in August, Carnival Week in Skegness in September. Almost every resort had a beauty contest. </p> <p>Meyerowitz was impressed by the change in his friend. \"When we met up in London in 1966, he seemed a little more rooted,\" he said. \"To me, Britain had the impoverished mentality of a postwar generation. There was a tightness and a rigidity in the culture. Tony had come back and was able to mock those mores and that lifestyle. It was perfect timing for him to return.\" </p> <p>In the mid-to-late 1960s, England's seaside resorts were filled with families taking their annual holidays. Ray-Jones captured the chaos of these groups - barefoot children wandering off down the sands, pensioners wrapped up in motley against the winds, young couples in awkward embraces, hamfisted fathers with their toddlers, chips and ice-cream and beer and litter, and everything happening at the same time in a choreography that sent the eye wandering off to the farthest edges of the picture and back again. The English seaside in black and white can be a grim place. But in the gestures of the people, Ray-Jones captured a whole range of human emotions; the lascivious tongue licking round the mouth of a spivvy-looking judge at a beauty contest in Southport; the gentle embrace of a young couple on a boat trip around Beachy Head, of which only the photographer among the rest of the holiday-makers on board seems aware; the joyless couple at Great Yarmouth, slumped under grimy fake palm trees, and, in the far left of the picture, the back of an unlit neon sign that reads JOYLAND in reverse. </p> <p>America had been a search: for a style, for a subject, for a means of self-expression that went beyond the neatly crafted magazine photograph. His most successful pictures have this strong, multilayered architecture, built up by the passage of people and events within the frame. There is a tension between control and the lack of it; between the structure of the picture and the chance encounters that undermine it. </p> <p>By 1968 he was ready to show his work to publishers, but London was not prepared. Fashion and advertising photographers were profiting from the \"youthquake\". There were new magazines and new products, particularly for teenagers and women. There were Sunday colour supplements. But most photography books (with the exception of Brandt) came from America. \"No one was putting photographs up on walls and saying 'This is Art', as they were already doing in America,\" Anna Ray-Jones said. \"And I think Tony brought that vision. But I think that was an alien view at the time, apart from a few enlightened people.\" </p> <p>Creative Camera, launched at the beginning of 1968, was dedicated to publishing personal portfolios and critical writing on photography. It was owned by Colin Osman, a photography enthusiast who owned and published Racing Pigeon magazine, and was based in his offices in Doughty Street. It was into this den of pigeon fanciers and photographers that a \"frizzy-haired guy with a Fu Manchu moustache\" walked with a yellow box under his arm and told editor Bill Jay, \"Your magazine's shit, but I can see you're trying. You just don't know enough, so I am here to help you.\" It was Tony Ray-Jones. The box contained pictures from America and for his proposed book. </p> <p>Jay was impressed by the pictures and published some of them in the October issue. He and Ray-Jones became friends and combatants in the battle to raise the British consciousness about photography. Ray-Jones insisted Jay go with him to New York, where he planned to show the dummy of his English book to American publishers. They stayed at the Chelsea Hotel, and Jay met a whole roster of American photographers, including Winogrand, Frank, Meyerowitz and Arbus. But Ray-Jones received little interest in his book. </p> <p>In the spring of 1969, some 54 of his photographs - entitled The English Seen - made up part of a group show of four photographers, Ray-Jones, Enzo Ragazzini, Dorothy Bohm and Don McCullin, at the ICA. It was the first photography exhibition the institute had held. Sue Davies, who two years later founded the Photographers' Gallery in London, was working there at the time. \"Everybody in the ICA thought photography was naff. But after that hundreds of people came. It was so refreshing. Most of the stuff at the ICA had been very esoteric, quite elitist, quite hard. Then other photographers came, asking, 'Can you show my work?' That's really what inspired me to think of starting a place for professional photographers to show their work properly.\" </p> <p>By the time of the ICA show, Ray-Jones had a more subtle understanding of his subject: \"I have tried to show the sadness and the humour in a gentle madness that prevails in a people. The situations are sometimes ambiguous and unreal, and the juxtaposition of elements seemingly unrelated, and yet the people are real. This, I hope, helps to create a feeling of fantasy. Photography can be a mirror and reflect life as it is, but I also think that perhaps it is possible to walk, like Alice, through a Looking Glass, and find another kind of world with the camera.\" </p> <p>In 1970 he was offered a teaching job at the San Francisco Art Institute. He needed \"an American breather\", his wife said, and they left for the west in 1971. He found teaching frustrating, but worked hard on stories for both American and British magazines, and experimented with colour for his own work. \"We had intended to move to Los Angeles because Tony decided he wanted to go into films,\" Anna Ray-Jones explained. \"I don't know what this transition would have really been like, but he decided he would study cinematography, and he was admitted to the Cal-Arts, into the school of cinema there. He became ill at the end of 1971 and it was apparent that something was very wrong. So it put the kibosh on all kinds of plans. And then he had to come home.\" He flew back to London on March 10 1972 and died three days later. </p> <p>Last summer in Arles, Martin Parr, a guest curator of the photography festival there, showed a small group of Ray-Jones prints, a preview of a much larger exhibition that opens, accompanied by a new book, at the Bradford musem later this month. More than any other photographer in the generation that followed Ray-Jones, Parr's work reflects his influence. He first saw Ray-Jones's photographs in 1970, when Bill Jay gave a lecture at Manchester Polytechnic, where Parr was a student. \"His pictures were about England. They had that contrast, that seedy eccentricity, but they showed it in a very subtle way. They have an ambiguity, a visual anarchy. They showed me what was possible.\" </p> <p>The recent history of photography in Britain is still being compiled and argued over. There is no doubt as to Ray-Jones's influence on the development of what came to be called \"independent\" British photography during the 1970s, but the degree of its importance is debated. To Jay, \"He galvanised a lot of young photographers. A myth was created about the 'independent artist'. It was created by people coming out of art colleges, absorbing the aura of the pure artist. You can exaggerate Tony's influence. The fact is that he wasn't there.\" For David Hurn, a Magnum photographer and a friend of Jay and Ray-Jones, the \"myth that has grown up, that Tony brought American photography to Britain [is] nonsense. These people were known about. I had a big flat in Bayswater. By the mid-1960s Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Winogrand, had all been to stay. The idea that photography in Britain wouldn't have happened without Tony is wrong.\" </p> <p>But from an American perspective, Britain lacked an original voice in photography during that period, and Ray-Jones stood out. \"There semed to be no precedent in England for work like that,\" John Szarkowski wrote, in answer to an email. \"Of course everyone in my country knew and revered Brandt, and respected Roger Mayne, but the surprising thing about Ray-Jones was that he had a different idea of what subject matter was possible for serious photography. It did not have to be heroic or poetic in any overt sense: it could be on the surface as tedious or as bland as our real tedious and bland lives usually are, and the photographs might still be compelling.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tony Ray-Jones, by Russell Roberts, is published by Boot at \u00a329.95. A Gentle Madness: The Photographs Of Tony Ray-Jones (1941-72) opens at the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television in Bradford on October 15.

  "<p>George Bernard Shaw's political writing had a profound impact on me as a teenager, and four decades later I am conscious of a personal debt to him. I still retain the beard I first grew in a spirit of emulation, even if it became a miniaturised version of his luxuriant growth when an election agent instructed me to cut it on the maxim, \"More hair: fewer votes\". </p> <p>Shaw's distinctive contribution to the Fabian ethos was to humanise it. He parted from Marx over the determinist character of the doctrine of historical inevitability, which wrote free will out of the script as effectively as Calvinism. For Shaw, socialism could only be achieved by human will and conscious effort. His key commitment was to the power of reason, and he therefore believed that socialism must be built by persuasion, by argument and by deliberate choice. </p> <p>The consequence was that he became the most active proselytiser among the early Fabians. In the decade after the formation of the Fabian Society, he addressed 1,000 meetings - in trade councils, Working Men's Clubs and debating societies, in every environment from open-air parks to smoke-filled bars. Many of his earliest plays were written on trains and trams travelling to and from these engagements. </p> <p>The motivation for this extraordinary campaigning output was in part a powerful anger at the injustice of Victorian society, but in part also a dramatist's enjoyment of performance. By all accounts the combination of his intellect and sense of drama was compelling. Annie Besant, the prototype feminist, was engaged to debate against Shaw but after hearing his speech, rose to announce her conversion to Fabianism. </p> <p>Perhaps one of the aspects of Shaw that attracted her was his stout and outspoken advocacy of women's rights. His plays are replete with confident, assertive women who share his rejection of the injustice of \"saddling the right to a child with the obligation to become a servant of a man\". Emmeline Pankhurst confided that the character of Ann Whitefield in Man and Superman had \"strengthened her purpose and fortified her courage\". In his last political work, Shaw asserted that Parliament could only properly be called a House of Commons when men and women were represented in equal numbers, a goal that half a century later still eludes us. </p> <p>Another Shavian theme that speaks to our time is his disgust at the stupidity and barbarity of war. Shaw was one of the first to point out that \"the mechanisation of modern war greatly reduces the power of human conscience\" and that as a result, a youth of ordinary good nature \"will release a bomb that will blow a whole street of family homes into smithereens, burning, blinding, mutilating scores of mothers and babies, without seeing anything of his handiwork\". If he were alive today, Shaw would have exposed the moral contrast between our emotional response to the appalling decapitation of a single person with a knife and the relative indifference of our media to the killing of 10,000 Iraqis by bomb and missile. </p> <p>Shaw's polemic on the folly of the British government in participating in the first world war was so magnificent that it immediately made him the target of patriots on the home front. His books were removed from libraries, his plays from London's West End and the son of prime minister Asquith called for him to be shot. True to its long tradition of liberal vacillation, the Guardian refused to publish a letter from him because \"one's duty now is to encourage and unite people\". Shaw's response to these critics was an uncompromising call to the soldiers of both armies to \"shoot their officers and go home\". </p> <p>It was supreme confidence in his intellectual superiority that sustained Shaw in persisting in his views against all comers. This was a source of strength that made him an iconoclastic figure, enthusiastic about challenging convention and orthodoxy in a way that would rapidly have caused him to be expelled from New Labour. The quintessential Shaw quotation is the one which celebrates the revolutionary power of original thought: \"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\" </p> <p>Yet over-confidence can also be a source of weakness. Shaw's fixation on the pioneering role of the intellectual contributed to his unhealthy tendency to attach too much importance to heroic leadership. This led him into the trap of naive admiration for the top-down modernisation of Russia under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, which is a cause of embarrassment to even the most devoted Shavian. Its sole redeeming feature is that Stalin left their two-hour meeting complaining that Shaw was an awful person. </p> <p>Fortunately for Fabianism, Shaw had a much better grasp from first-hand knowledge of the condition of working people in Britain. The result was a body of drama and tracts that to this day is unrivalled for its acute and biting account of an economic system that exposed the majority of the population to ruthless exploitation. Ironically, it is not the intellectual analysis of which Shaw was so proud that makes his writing still resonate with us today, but his powerful moral indignation. In Mrs Warren's Profession, prostitution is only a metaphor for the experience of a proletarian class exploited by a bourgeoisie which owed their respectable place in society to a financial system that to Shaw was equally immoral. </p> <p>Nor has Fabianism ever boasted another pamphleteer of such mordant wit. Shaw was a contemporary of Oscar Wilde and although his output had a more serious purpose, he could produce repartee just as sharp. On his 90th birthday he was interviewed by a young journalist who took his leave by expressing the hope that he would be able to interview Shaw when he was 100. With characteristic self-confidence Shaw replied: \"I don't see why not. You look healthy enough.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article appears in Fabian Thinkers: 120 years of progressive thought , published by the Fabian Society at \u00a36.95 on October 20. <a href=\"http://www.fabian-society.org.uk.\">www.fabian-society.org.uk.</a></p>"
