  "<p><strong>This I Believe</strong><br>by Carlos Fuentes<br>translated by Kristina Cordero<br>Bloomsbury \u00a320, pp342</p> <p>Self-importance is the occupational disease of public life, so it isn't surprising that Carlos Fuentes, who has been Mexico's ambassador in Paris and is also his country's most celebrated novelist, should have picked up a double dose.</p> <p>As he remarks, Latin American countries in particular have looked to writers for their sense of national identity. Now he gives us his thoughts on a number of subjects, arranged alphabetically, from 'Amor' to 'Zurich'.</p> <p>The subjects fall into three main categories, the political ('Revolution', 'Globalisation' and, indeed, 'Politics'), the cultural ('Balzac', 'Faulkner' and 'Vel\u00e1zquez') and the personal, as exemplified by 'Children', 'Sex' and 'Silvia' , his second wife.</p> <p>The political pieces read as if they were written to be delivered to a crowd ('Let us move from identity to diversity through a path of respect'). It would have to be a docile crowd, though, to applaud 17 consecutive sentences beginning 'I am concerned...', particularly as the last one is the less than rabble-rousing: 'I am concerned about all that jeopardises the continuity of life.'</p> <p>When Fuentes talks about 'Education', he announces that it should be 'the first item on the agenda of every nation in the world', which has a familiar ring, but before he has finished he has slyly defined his terms. 'If the private sector does not support public education,' he suggests, 'it will marginalise its potential consumers.'</p> <p>More than that, he proposes that 'the challenge of education is to offer knowledge that is directly connected to professional goals'. The effect is of hearing the chancellor of a university talk for half an hour about excellence, then thank Pepsi-Cola for endowing the chair of carbonated drinks.</p> <p>Sometimes, Fuentes strikes a grand rhetorical note: 'Let us not open, as did Virgil in hell, an ivory gate to send false illusions into the world. Far more preferable is the patience of Job, for whom the waters ultimately eroded the rocks, but also allowed the tree to sprout anew.' Sometimes, he aims less high, as when he refers to 'the beauty, without exception, of all the children of Mexico'. This is as close to kissing babies as prose allows.</p> <p>When Fuentes discusses cultural matters, high and low jostle in the same sentence: 'Shakespeare grabbed words by the ass and made them shriek and bitch, showing us that the range of expression cannot be constrained by the constipated or famished genres of literature.' He quotes compulsively, although he often plays fast and loose with what he cites: 'Memory, succession and legitimacy are the true \"bare bodkin\" that Hamlet brandishes, though the price he pays will be the \"hush\" of death.'</p> <p>He quotes his own novels more frequently (on every subject) than any other literary source and pays far more respect to their continuity than he does when it comes to poor Shakespeare. He defers to his own authority. The implication is that these utterances are definitive, clinching what passes here for argument.</p> <p>There's a great deal of repetition in This I Believe, notably when the section on 'Reading' follows on from 'Quixote' with a discussion of... Don Quixote. Repetition is no sin when it follows a pattern of development, but there's no sign of that in these pages and only a couple of forlorn acknowledgments ('In an earlier section, I have alluded...'; As I mention elsewhere...') address the high level of redundancy in the volume.</p> <p>In the personal sections, Fuentes shows no signs of overcoming his addiction to pseudo-epigrammatic formulations: 'In the end, to know sex is to know the harbinger of the words of love, and to not know what follows because the harbinger is enough and interrupts the very thing it promises'; 'If all the women I have loved could be encapsulated in one, the only woman I have loved for ever encapsulates all the others.'</p> <p>It's as if he has been misled by a false syllogism; just because a paradox offends against sense at first sight, it doesn't follow that everything which offends against sense is a rewarding paradox.</p> <p>Having so many short sections excuses Fuentes from exploring his own contradictions in a way that might justify such a book. How to reconcile the prophet of ecological apocalypse with the high flier who likes nothing better than looking down from a plane on the Andes or the Rockies, and (in the section 'Urbanities') compares the virtues of 28 cities?</p> <p>There seems no connection between the public figure who harps on about the vital importance of feminism and the senior citizen who reminisces contentedly about the Mexico City brothels of his youth and celebrates urban seasons in sentences like: 'London: spring will bloom in two youthful breasts behind a sheath of transparent organdie.'</p> <p>A jarring third element is provided by a romanticism which refers to women as 'the fleeting voyagers of the dawn' and celebrates his lovely wife with the declaration: 'Every night I leave an invisible note on her pillow that says, \"I like you\".' Less fattening than chocolate, certainly, as well as less trouble.</p> <p>Some of the trouble must be due to Kristina Cordero, the translator. It's possible Fuentes writes a hideous Spanish which she faithfully renders into hideous English, but it seems more likely that he's an old smoothie as a stylist, which is how he can get away with so much vacuous preening in the original.</p> <p>As a translator, she is some way short of competence. What is 'the act of love without sex' (page 22)? Where is the English sense in this: 'From this, our Latin America, from these fertile, beautiful, aching, trampled lands that have been shot down by themselves and by those who covet either their poverty or their beauty - I don't know which - we ask, today, to globalise not only the fact but the right to make rights out of commerce and health, education and environment, work and security'?</p> <p>It's eccentric for Fuentes to quote Wittgenstein twice on one page - the same sentence - but zany for her to translate it two different ways. Bad enough for an author to repeat himself without the translator seizing the chance of another stab at a possible meaning.</p> <p>The strangest moment may have more to do with the translator than the author. Writing about his wonderful father ('a man of good humour, tenderness, punctuality: a good example'), he records that on the day he died, Fuentes Sr 'did two things: he tried on a new suit and he sexually harassed my mother'. Fuentes's attitudes towards women are dodgy enough, but can he really be praising Dad for cornering Mum in the kitchen? Perhaps the Spanish means something more like 'made gallant romantic advances to'.</p>",
  "<p><strong>IOU: The Debt Threat And Why We Must Defuse It</strong><br>by Noreena Hertz<br>Fourth Estate \u00a316.99, pp308</p> <p>Ageing Irish rock legends are not among the usual dramatis personae of economics books, but Noreena Hertz begins this searing critique with U2 front man Bono.</p> <p>He has campaigned furiously for years for forgiveness of multibillion dollar global debts, and Hertz seeks to capture the attention of readers unfamiliar with dry global economics by asking what 'made Bono mad', what enraged the singer enough to send him around the world, lobbying hundreds of politicians and even the Pope?</p> <p>She tells the sorry story of the exponential build-up of lending to poor countries over the postwar years, from rich neighbours keen to buy their political co-operation; later from private banks looking for somewhere to stash billions of petrodollars which flowed out of oil-rich states after the 1970s supply-shocks; and finally from the Bretton Woods institutions - the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>After the Second World War, these bodies spent much of the 1980s and 1990s imposing a strict economic diet on debtor countries, often with dire consequences. Hertz worked for the World Bank's sister organisation, the International Finance Corporation, in Russia in the early 1990s. She recounts her own epiphany, as she weighed up the prescriptive policy changes imposed on the country - liberalise prices, open up markets, privatise state enterprises - with the experiences of ordinary people.</p> <p>'It became obvious... that the country's traditions, culture and history could not just be razed overnight - the \"one size fits all\" solution we were trying to impose was not going to fit.'</p> <p>The interest rate poor countries pay on their debts is acutely sensitive to the market's judgments about their likelihood of default. Brazil saw the price of its bonds plummet in 2002 as left-wing presidential candidate Luis Inacio da Silva shot up in the polls. Hertz tracks down some of these bond traders and discovers (unsurprisingly to anyone who has read Bonfire of the Vanities) that the last thing on their minds is the social conditions in borrower countries. 'The thing is, Noreena,' one of them tells her, 'capitalism has no soul.'</p> <p>Nicknamed the 'Nigella Lawson of economics', Hertz brings to her subject the angry rhetoric of the anti-globalisation protester. The moral culpability of the developed world for the Aids epidemic in poor countries is as great 'as if it had stuck HIV-infected needles into its mothers and children'.</p> <p>She introduces new urgency into the argument for debt-forgiveness. She believes globalisation means that the pain inflicted on a poverty-stricken developing world by the necessity of meeting debt repayments rebounds on us all.</p> <p>As she puts it: 'By exacerbating poverty, eroding national self-worth and promoting behaviour on the part of states that is often to the detriment of society at large, debt has far-reaching consequences.'</p> <p>She goes on to list environmental destruction, the spread of curable infectious diseases and even terrorism as more or less direct consequences of refusing to lift the 'debt threat'.</p> <p>Hertz spends her last chapters laying out a 'blueprint' for resolving the crisis. Some kind of international panel would decide which long-standing debts should be struck down, outlawing those contracted by undemocratic regimes; used against the interests of the people; and where the lenders knew they were likely to be misused. Where a debt was ruled illegal, the money saved would be ring-fenced and spent by a 'National Regeneration Trust,' thus bypassing corruption and ensuring that it would be spent on healthcare and anti-poverty programmes, instead of paying for weapons or lavish palaces.</p> <p>The political and legal obstacles in the path of such a plan are formidable, as Hertz acknowledges. The current US regime has set its face against every attempt at multilateralism, in particular an international criminal court, so the likelihood of getting crucial US buy-in for an institution that would tell powerful lenders they won't get their money back looks remote. Hertz says of her proposal: 'Discuss it. Refine it. Improve upon it. But don't ignore it. You can't afford to.'</p> <p>Unfortunately, history suggests that ignoring it is precisely what those in power will do, unless she can 'massively mobilise' opinion. Noreena Hertz is angry - and wants you to get angry too.</p>",
  "<p>When he addresses the Labour Party conference in Brighton tomorrow, Gordon Brown will do so as the longest serving Labour Chancellor. What is more, in June he equalled Lloyd George's record of seven consecutive years at the Treasury, also becoming the longest serving Chancellor since Nicholas Vansittart (1812 to 1823). </p> <p>In his new book, Diaries 1980-2001 (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), the Labour peer Giles Radice, a close observer and participant in the trials, tribulations and triumphs of Labour over many years, summarises Brown's chancellorship thus: 'Gordon Brown delivered a long period of low inflation, steady growth and falling unemployment. His decision to give operational management over monetary policy to the Bank of England, the tight control of public spending and sustained investment in education, health and policies to promote employment and help the less well-off were either the direct responsibility of the Chancellor or received his firm backing.' </p> <p>Although Lord Radice had a hand in helping Tony Blair win selection as a Labour candidate, he has always been his own man, and pays this tribute from the position of one who, while an admirer, certainly cannot be accused of being 'in the Brown camp'. But he also does so at a time when, after a long period in which he has enjoyed a very favourable public image, the Chancellor has become subject to adverse criticism over his putative role in the pensions crisis, and when more and more eyebrows have been raised about the viability of Brown's 'golden rule' with regard to public sector finances, not to mention the concerns about boom and bust in the housing market. </p> <p>In view of the extraordinarily good run Brown has had, these criticisms inevitably call to mind the Chancellor's favourite joke: 'There are two kinds of Chancellor: those who fail and those who get out in time.' But if there is one thing certain about Brown, it is that he does not want to go down as a failure; and if there is a second thing that is certain, it is that he does not wish to 'get out in time' by leaving behind a mess, because that would hardly redound to his credit, whether or not he proceeded to fulfil his ambition to succeed Blair. </p> <p>At the macro-economic level, Brown's record is certainly very impressive. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies may constantly be chiding him over his conduct of the nation's finances but, like the proverbial cat, this Chancellor has many fiscal lives. By comparison with those of the US and much of the EU, Brown's fiscal record is exemplary. Meanwhile, as the IFS has recently cal culated, the country's economic growth performance since 1997 has been impressive by past standards. Thus, against an average growth rate of 2.4 per cent from the Second World War to 1996/7, economic growth under Brown's stewardship has averaged 2.7 per cent, compared with 2.4 per cent in the Seventies, 2.3 per cent in the Eighties and 1.7 per cent from 1990 to 1997. </p> <p>The Treasury enjoys reminding us at every opportunity that the country has enjoyed the longest period of sustained economic growth for many decades. And it is not just partisan commentators in the UK who note that, unlike most other industrial countries, Britain under Brown has not experienced a single quarter of contraction, or what economic analysts like to call, in that frightful term, 'negative growth'. </p> <p>For this experience, it is widely acknowledged that much of the credit must go to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which, after a long period when short-term economic management was out of fashion, has been managing demand in the economy by the month - and even, on occasion (such as the nervous period in financial markets after 11 September 2001), by the fortnight. </p> <p>In a sense, the MPC can hardly believe its luck. It is a standing joke among present and past members that, whenever someone retires, in his or her farewell remarks the point is invariably made that things must become tougher henceforth. And Mervyn King himself has often warned that it would be foolhardy to assume that things can go on like this. </p> <p>So far, however, so good. And it is Brown who takes the credit for the remarkable decision, for a Labour administration, to give operational freedom to the Bank of England. Under previous Labour governments, the Bank had often been regarded as a 'class enemy'. But Brown turned the conventional wisdom on its head and decided, that, if he was to fulfil his ambitions for public spending, he had to get the financial markets on his side. The way to avoid a 'bankers' ramp' was to hand authority over to the bank that bankers and traders most respect: the Bank of England. </p> <p>If anything, this strategy has been almost too successful. Although the pound has recently started to decline, it has, on average, been very high for most of Brown's chancellorship. This has affected the performance of overseas trade, with imports rising much faster than exports. Indeed, since 2001 the volume of UK exports has actually declined slightly. And the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pointed out in June that 'the real exchange rate, measured in terms of consumer prices' was, in March, 'at its highest level since the early Eighties'. </p> <p>Although the pound has edged down since its further 6 per cent rise in January and February, the prolonged impact of its strength on our international competitiveness has been a counterweight to the myriad detailed measures the Chancellor has introduced to boost productivity. </p> <p>This Labour government, haunted by past failures to control inflation, has been lucky to hold office against a background of disinflationary trends around the world, associated with the ascendancy of independent central banks and intense price competition among multinationals under what is colloquially known as 'globalisation'. Nevertheless, it is a considerable tribute to the MPC, Brown's creation, that the macro-economic environment has been so relatively stable. </p> <p>How long this will continue is anybody's guess. While appearing, overall, to have moved from a hawkish to a dovish position in recent months, the MPC seems to be unclear as to whether it has got things under control or not. The August Inflation Report, and a subsequent speech by 'external' member Steve Nickett, gave the impression the MPC thought fears about 'excessive spending' and a consumer debt crisis had been exaggerated. Other members of the MPC are not so sure. </p> <p>The MPC's job is to control not the level of house prices, but the overall level of inflation. Whether or not the long-predicted fall in house prices is under way, and notwithstanding the MPC's latest assessment that 'the news from the labour market in the past month has been on the weak side', the OECD has just raised its forecast for UK growth this year from 3.1 per cent to to 3.4 per cent, and still sees the economy expanding at a rate that could put pressure on capacity and inflation, leading to a possible further rise in interest rates. The International Monetary Fund seems more worried about the possibility of a house price crash and slowdown in the economy. </p> <p>With regard to macro-economic policy, the buck stops at Brown's desk. So far, so good. But there is a lot of nervousness in the air.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Keegan's latest book, The Prudence of Mr Gordon Brown (Wiley), is now available in paperback at \u00a39.99.</p>",
  "<p>Bernie Ecclestone, Lakshmi Mittal, Paul Grayson: Labour has been so effective at snuggling up to business since 1997 that it has managed to get itself embroiled in the kinds of cash-for-access scandals that were once the preserve of the Tory party. </p> <p>Winning over doubters in the business world was key to the long, slow transformation that brought Labour into power: but with another election just months away, the government can no longer take the confidence of the money men for granted. </p> <p>It started with seafood. 'Never have so many crustaceans died in vain,' Michael Heseltine quipped at the height of then shadow chancellor John Smith's 'prawn cocktail offensive', in which he whirled around the Square Mile trying to convince traditionally Tory-supporting bankers, brokers and directors that he wouldn't threaten their prosperity. Labour went on to lose its fourth successive election in 1992, stung by Tory charges that it was about to drop a 'tax bomb' on middle England. </p> <p>But that was before Black Wednesday, in September that year, when Norman Lamont ramped up interest rates to 15 per cent in a vain attempt to prop up the pound against the Deutschmark, and wiped out the Tories' hard-won reputation for economic management at a stroke. Labour was handed the opportunity it had longed for, to take over as the party business could trust. </p> <p>Handing independence to the Bank of England as soon as he arrived in the Treasury in May 1997 is still viewed as Gordon Brown's master-stroke, bringing him an immediate credibility windfall, as the markets bet that borrowing costs would probably be lower once rate-setting was divorced from politics. </p> <p>Stephen Alambritis, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, says Brown is still reaping the political benefits of that early decision, and the stable economic environment it helped to create. 'There is a concern about the cumulative effects of regulation, but that is being cushioned by the low interest rates,' he says. </p> <p> Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, agrees. 'On the economic policy front, his best decision was his first decision,' he says. </p> <p>Over time, though, businesses have begun to take the more stable macroeconomic framework for granted, and quibbles about Labour's interventionist policies in other areas have begun to get louder. 'It's a very regulating government, it's a very interfering government,' says Digby Jones, director-general of the CBI. 'They regulate first, and they ask questions second. I wish occasionally they would reward ministers for doing nothing. That would be refreshing!' </p> <p>Leach at the IoD agrees. 'Survey after survey of our members shows that regulation is a major issue. And Brown's tax and spend policy is the wrong way around - you've got to get the system working effectively first; then you put more money in.' </p> <p>'Tax and spend' is a label the Brown Treasury has fought hard to avoid. It was very proud of the public consensus it consciously tried to build in the run-up to the 2002 Budget - that improving the NHS was a goal worth paying extra for. But the consensus never really stretched as far as businesses. </p> <p>The CBI and other groups reacted angrily to the announcement that firms' national insurance contributions would rise. They thought they had a close working relationship with the Treasury, and were delighted with measures such as research and development tax credits; but the \u00a34 billion rise in employer NICs came as a bolt from the blue. Iain Vallance, the outgoing CBI president, accused Labour at the time of 'cutting open the goose that lays the golden egg'. </p> <p>'Too much red tape' has long been a gripe of businesses, but Ruth Lea, of the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies, says firms don't like being used as tools to further other government aims. </p> <p>She singles out Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt, who mooted the idea of a year's paid statutory maternity leave last Monday. 'The gloves are off,' Lea says. 'Whatever [Hewitt] might have said in the past, what she's really about is social engineering.' </p> <p>Martin Temple, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, is also concerned about the weight of legislation on his members, many of whom are small businesses. 'The economy has been better than we expected, but the cost of government has been an issue, and remains an issue.' He points to energy costs, employment legislation and pensions as areas for complaint. </p> <p>Pensions policy has become a political minefield for Brown. With the dotcom boom in full swing, his decision in 1997 to prevent pension funds from claiming back the tax they paid on share dividends elicited barely a whimper from the markets. Its laudable aim was to persuade companies to reinvest their profits, instead of facing pressure from shareholders to pay them out as dividends. </p> <p>But once the market started to turn down, opening up giant black holes in many corporate pension funds, things looked very different. City investors now blame the \u00a35bn-a-year increase in pen sion funds' tax bills for exacerbating the funding shortfalls in many of Britain's corporate pension funds - and the lacklustre performance of the FTSE in recent years. </p> <p>Vince Cable, the Lib-Dem Treasury spokesman, says pensions policy, and in particular the removal of tax relief, is at the heart of City suspicions about Labour. 'It was a catalyst,' he says. 'What stuck in the craw was the spectacular naivete that the stock market bubble would go on for ever and they could just take money out of it.' </p> <p>Now, he says, 'there are massive worries about long-term pensions. I think there's a feeling that the current system isn't working, and can't be made to work.' </p> <p>The complex system of means-tested benefits for the elderly is aimed at giving most help to the poorest; but the financial institutions complain that it discourages saving, and consumers don't understand how it works. </p> <p>Beefed-up City regulation, led by the FSA, is another bugbear. When the Bank of England was in charge of banking regulation, it was seen as batting for the City, giving it a voice in government. The FSA is seen as meddling. 'It's a very, very intrusive regime,' says one City analyst. Callum McCarthy, the FSA's chairman, received a less-than-warm reception when he addressed the City banquet at the Mansion House last week. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the long list of niggles, however, there are still two great bulwarks that have prevented Labour's business support from ebbing away. The first is the strong, stable performance of the economy: unemployment remains at its lowest level for a generation, and Brown avoided the recessions that hit the US and much of the eurozone after the post 11 September stock market crash. </p> <p>More important, though, is the fact that the Tories still aren't seen as fully credible. Appointing a 'shadow secretary of state for deregulation' is an attempt to tap into business anxieties about Labour; but John Redwood is not the most hard-hitting political performer. And until the Tories can promise business a regime they think would be more to their advantage, they're unlikely to swing their weight - and their cash - behind electing Howard and his team. </p> <p>As one insider put it when asked about the City's relationship with Labour last week: 'The honeymoon finished long ago. We've had the divorce, but it's being followed by a long period of celibacy.'</p> <p><strong>How six key Number 11 decisions went down with business</strong></p> <p><strong>May 1997:</strong> Bank of England independence. Brown hands power to set interest rates to a new Monetary Policy Committee. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Universal applause. Independent monetary policy is seen as one of the key factors that has underpinned the economy since 1997.</p> <p><strong>July 1997:</strong> In his first full Budget, Brown announces that pension funds will no longer be able to reclaim tax on share dividends. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> At the time, indifference; more recently, fury. The \u00a35 billion-a-year extra cost is blamed for exacerbating what has become known as the 'pensions crisis'. But the Treasury points out it was part of a pro-business package that also included a 2 per cent cut in corporation tax.</p> <p><strong>April 1999:</strong> National minimum wage comes into force. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Suspicion, giving way to relief. Predictions of resultant job losses fail to materialise, partly because the wage is set lower than unions had hoped, at \u00a33.60. The Tories later drop their opposition to a minimum wage, underlining the fact that it has been seen as a success.</p> <p><strong>April 2000:</strong> Firms become responsible for administering the government's working families tax credit through the payroll. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Irritation at the extra costs involved. The Treasury later rescinds the decision, but the Institute of Directors says: 'It would have been better if it had never been introduced in the first place. Employers are going to have to pay significant amounts of money to amend their payroll systems yet again.'</p> <p><strong>April 2002:</strong> Employers' national insur ance contributions increase by 1 per cent as part of a tax-raising package aimed at pouring more money into the NHS. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Horror, giving way to resignation. Companies agree that Britain's crumbling infrastructure is in need of investment, but they hadn't planned on paying for it themselves.</p> <p><strong>Summer 2004:</strong> The government suggests that Crossrail, the long-delayed transport link through the centre of London, could finally go ahead - but only if business will stump up some of the cash. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Sceptical approval. The overcrowded transport infrastructure is widely seen as one of the major barriers to running a business in Britain; London mayor Ken Livingstone gets a big cheer at the City banquet for backing the line.</p>",
  "<p>The Daily Mail owner DMGT is demanding a seat on the board of the merged GWR/Capital in exchange for supporting the proposed nil-premium merger between the two radio companies, which is expected to be completed within days. </p> <p>Both companies are due to make trading statements this week and sources close to the negotiations say the tie-up will be formally announced alongside one of these, barring last-minute problems. </p> <p>DMGT's finance director, Peter Williams, sits on the board of GWR, in which the Mail has a 29.9 per cent stake, and it is understood DMGT will back the deal as long as Williams's board position is guaranteed. Under the terms of the tie-up, DMGT's stake in the combined group would be diluted to around 15 per cent. </p> <p>Talks between the two companies and their advisers are continuing, and a potential dispute about the management roles of Capital's chief executive David Mansfield and Ralph Bernard, his opposite number at GWR, is thought to have been avoided. In a stock exchange announcement last week, the companies said Mansfield will be chief executive and Bernard executive chairman. Bernard and Mansfield are leading lights in the radio industry and some share holders are concerned that both will be eager to take charge of the combined group, which will be Britain's largest radio company with a market value of \u00a3700 million. </p> <p>One of the biggest shareholders is Fidelity, the US fund manager that led a campaign to oust Michael Green as chairman-designate of ITV after the merger of Granada and Carlton. Sources close to Fidelity said it fears a repeat of the management conflicts that threatened the ITV deal, which led to the removal of Green in a boardroom coup.</p> <p>Sources close to the GWR talks say the huge sums Granada and Carlton spent on the disastrous ITV digital joint venture were a factor in Fidelity's move to oust Green, in contrast with GWR and Capital's successes. But shareholders insist the roles must be clearly defined for them to back the deal.</p>",
  "<p>Denise, 62, wants to know how her health problems might affect her finances:</p> <p>'I was diagnosed with leukaemia shortly after I retired two years ago. As it is in the very early stages, I have not told my family: I want to save them unnecessary worry. </p> <p>I have an occupational pension of about \u00a38,000 plus a state pension, but I am not sure what to do about two freestanding FSAVCs, one worth \u00a338,000 and the other \u00a312,000. I have not converted them into annuities yet because I know the pension rules are being changed and that annuity rates are low. I am aware that I can get an enhanced annuity rate because of my leukaemia but I am not sure whether it would be better to spend my savings as and when I want and leave the FSAVCs so that they can form part of an inheritance for my children and grandchildren, take the annuities as soon as possible, or wait until the new pension rules come into effect, when I believe I can take 25 per cent cash. </p> <p>Regarding my health, I am feeling absolutely fine at the moment and have plenty of energy. I could live for 20 more years and die of something else, according to my doctor. On the other hand, an insurance salesman told me that they reckon seven years for leukaemia patients - not the most tactful person you could meet. </p> <p>At the moment I am working part time and expect to earn about \u00a38,000 this year. I have around \u00a325,000 in savings in Peps and Isas. I also have money set aside from my pension lump sum to pay off an outstanding mort gage of \u00a315,000 in two years' time. My current house was purchased for \u00a3150,000 in February 2003. I have an endowment policy with Norwich Union which finishes in 2011, but I am trying to get compensation for that as the final date is nine years after my retirement date. That policy is currently worth about \u00a316,000. It will pay \u00a326,000 on death but was originally projected at \u00a345,000. I have two other small endowment policies against loans, neither of which look like reaching its initial target. I have repaid the loans and now wonder whether it is still worth paying the premiums on these policies.'</p> <p><strong>First and foremost: enjoy life to the full</strong></p> <p>I am very sorry to hear about your leukaemia. You are doing the right thing by taking it into account in your retirement planning. Your first consideration, though, should be your own income requirements rather than the interests of your beneficiaries. Whatever your life expectancy, it is important that you enjoy your retirement to the full while you are still in good health. There is no point in leaving your money invested in your FSAVCs if your income in inadequate. </p> <p>Having said that, income does not seem to be your immediate problem as you are working part time. Indeed if you did take the annuity now, it would increase the amount of income tax you pay.</p> <p>Normally it makes sense to take the tax-free lump sum from a pension where this is available, even if maximum income is required. Investing the money in an ordinary life annuity is more tax efficient: part of the income from ordinary annuities is treated as a 'return of capital' by the tax man, which means it is tax-free. Payments on pension annuities, on the other hand, are taxed in full as earned income.</p> <p>If you don't need the income immediately, waiting until after April 2006 when the pension rules change will mean you can take a 25 per cent tax-free cash sum from your FSAVC funds. With your smaller FSAVC, you may be able to take the whole amount in cash, less a 20 per cent tax charge on the balance above the 25 per cent tax free sum. This is because after April 2006 the amount deemed to be a 'trivial pension' (and therefore available as cash) is also being increased from \u00a32,500 to \u00a315,000.</p> <p>Another potential advantage of waiting until 2006, points out Dean Mirfin of adviser Key Retirement Solutions, is that you will be older and may therefore receive a better annuity rate.</p> <p>You ask whether it would be better to use up your other savings before you take your pensions. John Turton, director of life and pensions at financial adviser Bestinvest, says this is a sound approach if you are likely to be liable for inheritance tax on other assets. He says 'Good succession planning (especially for someone in poor health) is to take privately held assets liable to inheritance tax first and the pension second. Unvested pensions are written under trust and will pay out inher itance tax free benefits on death before vesting.' However, it would appear that your assets may be under the inheritance tax threshold (\u00a3263,000 for 2004-5) so tax may not be an issue for you.</p> <p>To help you make a decision about your FSAVCs, you should approach an independent financial adviser to check what rate you could get for an 'impaired life annuity'. These annuities pay out higher amounts to those with health problems, depending on the extent to which the actuaries believe they will affect life expectancy. Peter Quinton, managing director of The Annuity Bureau, suggests sourcing an impaired life annuity through a specialist provider such as GE Life, Just Retirement or Pension Annuity Friendly Society.'</p> <p>Whenever you decide to buy an annuity 'the major risk is whether it will pay out enough should death occur prematurely', says Turton. 'This could be countered with a guaranteed period or via an alternatively secured pension from 2006. However, if this is done, the annuity rate will fall.'</p> <p>Under current rules you are not required to purchase an annuity until age 75. Mirfin says: 'If Denise can manage on her income/pension as it stands it may be advantageous to put off purchasing the annuity until she really needs to supplement her income.'</p> <p>If you decide to delay, it will be mean your FSAVCs remain invested and can continue growing in a virtually tax-free environment. However, Mirfin advises you to check that the charges and investment performance of your FSAVC providers are competitive. If not, you may get a better deal by switching to a lower-cost stakeholder pension.</p> <p>As regards your mortgage and endowment policies, you may be better off using your savings to clear your loan. The advantage of keeping your endowment policies is that they provide life insurance cover which, because of your health and age, you would otherwise find difficult to purchase.</p> <p><strong>Denise's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> If you need extra income, do not put off buying an annuity for the sake of your beneficiaries. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> If you wait until 2006, you will be able to take a 25 per cent tax-free cash sum from your FSAVCs and possibly take the remainder of the small policy in cash too.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> If you decide to buy an annuity, seek the help of an independent financial adviser with specialist knowledge of impaired-life annuities.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> If you are going to put off your annuity purchase until 2006 or later, check that your FSAVC policies are competitive in terms of cost and performance.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Consider paying off your mortgage.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Bear in mind that your existing endowments are providing you with an element of life insurance.</p> <p><strong>Let us help you</strong></p> <p>Do you need some financial coaching?

  "<b> Help on drugs </b> <p>The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) is committed to seeing more, better and more widely available treatment for drug misusers (News, last week).

  "<p>It is a sign of the continuing racing boom that Ascot can spend \u00a3185million on the redevelopment work that starts in earnest tomorrow without serious concern that, as has happened at Wembley and the Dome, they might be throwing good money after bad. </p> <p>'We confronted the decision of what to do in 1998,' says Ascot's chief executive Douglas Erskine-Crum. 'And after a feasibility study we realised that patch-up was not an option and neither was the status quo. In order to have a course which, in size and scale, was commensurate with our position in racing, it was necessary to undertake total redevelopment.' </p> <p>The fact that they are able, as Erskine-Crum says, 'to undertake it from within our financial resources' is testament to Ascot's recent success. 'We have done very well over the last few years. At our height, before the recent expenditure, we were making a \u00a312m profit on a turnover of \u00a332m.' </p> <p>One of the reasons for such figures is that racecourse managements have cottoned on to the fact that many punters go to the races only incidentally for the racing. They go to have fun, to eat and drink and flirt and flutter. They comprise a willingly captive audience intent on spending their money. Nowhere does the tight man stand out more than on a racecourse. 'Catering is almost a core business now,' says Erskine-Crum. 'On the Thursday of the Royal Meeting we seated nearly 15,000 people to lunch. It was probably the biggest catering operation in Europe.' </p> <p>More people were fed in that one afternoon than many Michelin-starred restaurants serve in a year. Fed pretty decently, too, because the days when Barrie Cope was the only person offering edible food are long gone. </p> <p>The highlight of the Ascot year is, of course, the Royal meeting, which attracts crowds of 50,000 to 80,000 on each of five successive days. Many are women. </p> <p>'We have done significant market research,' says Erskine-Crum, 'and at Royal Ascot the proportion of women attending is something like 44 per cent. It also revealed that it is a bit of a fallacy that it's mainly the elderly and middle-aged who go racing. A much higher proportion than you might think are in their twenties and early thirties.' </p> <p>Seedy, tired old racing, it seems, has achieved what every marketing man would give his iPod for and captured the youth market. </p> <p>The increase in race attendances has occurred not just at the top of the market but across the board. A prime mover behind this expansion was Sir Stanley Clarke, who died last week. 'He turned round many racecourses, some from country tracks, and provided them with much better facilities and prize money,' says Erskine-Crum. 'And he was rewarded with higher attendances. He was really good for racing.' </p> <p>In so doing,Clarke, chairman of Northern Racing Ltd and a committed Margaret Thatcher supporter, reversed one of her favourite creeds by creating a trickle-up rather than a trickle-down effect: have a few good days out at Uttoxeter and pretty soon you will be aspiring to Ascot, Cheltenham and Newmarket. </p> <p>It is as if football, rather than monomaniacally pushing the Premiership, came to its senses and realised that the lower divisions offer a product for which there could be a demand. </p> <p>The Ascot redesign will be carried out by HOK Sport, led by chairman and stadium architect Rod Sheard, who designed the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and Stadium Australia in Sydney. He is also working on Wembley and Arsenal's new stadium. </p> <p>When finished, the redevelopment 'will strengthen both Ascot's and British racing's position at the forefront of the global racing industry', says Martin Broughton, chairman of the British Horseracing Board. If all goes to plan it promises to be a veritable fun palace, a shining exemplar of the gaiety of the nation. </p> <p>Erskine-Crum is already thanking others. 'We have had a great deal of support from many in the racing industry and, in particular, consulted with our customers, many of whose ideas have been incorporated into the redevelopment.' The work includes construction of a new grandstand, although the capacity will remain at 80,000, and realignment of the track. </p> <p>But he saves the best news for last: 'The tunnel will definitely disappear. Which is one very good reason for the redevelopment.' </p> <p>At last, the wretched tunnel, whose only purpose was to relegate regular punters below the status of children so that they were neither heard nor seen, will be no more. And \u00a3185m is a small price to pay. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Convincing defence and the ability to convert some, if not all, possession into tries allowed Gloucester an impressive victory over a muted Newcastle. But it still left Nigel Melville disappointed. 'We have to be happy beating a team that had won three out of three,' he said. 'But we're disappointed not to gain the bonus point for the fourth try. Jake [Boer, Gloucester's captain] dropped the ball over the line.' </p> <p>Gloucester's director of rugby is conscious that Sale top the Premiership courtesy of their own extra point following their demolition of Worcester on Friday, but he must be happy that it is only his side, along with the Sharks, who remain unbeaten this season. </p> <p>A grey and drizzly sky greeted the record 13,000 crowd at newly developed Kingsholm. Before the teams got intimate, Jonny Wilkinson was out warming up his catching and kicking limbs and as he ran the width of the pitch was clapped by the Shed, a rare gesture afforded visiting players in these parts. They may have been applauding the next England captain. </p> <p>This was the fly-half's fourth competitive game since his return from injury, but it was opposite number Duncan McRae who pinned the visitors back inside their 22 early on. From the resulting line-out, the ball was moved through two phases before it went sideways and from an infringement, Henry Paul opened the home side's account after nine minutes. </p> <p>Much of the ball was being fought for around the halfway mark and when the opening try came it was from just inside Gloucester's half. After Falcons' full-back Matt Burke had held on, Andy Gomarsall quickly took a tap penalty, gained 10 yards for Newcastle not retreating, took it with haste again and then kicked over the top. Burke was out of position and Marcel Garvey, flying through from the right wing, collected and scored an easy try that Paul converted. </p> <p>Gloucester then took hold of the game. A line-out right on the Falcons' line was taken by Adam Balding and from the driving maul, Alex Brown scored his side's second try, though Paul failed to convert. Three regulation Wilkinson penalties answered by two from Paul kept Gloucester's advantage comfortable, but they will have gone into the break disappointed not to have scored a least another try - with Boer the obvious culprit for his spill from replacement Mathew Tait's tackle. </p> <p>Rob Andrew brought on Andy Long, Colin Charvis and James Isaacson in an attempt to ensure it was his side who registered the vital next score. 'We didn't play like we did at Bath,' he said. 'We weren't allowed to. But if we could only have scored a try, we could have threatened them.' </p> <p>When Wilkinson added his fourth penalty a minute before the hour, his side were just nine points behind, but as the game entered the final quarter, Newcastle could not turn possession into profit. </p> <p>Wilkinson, disappointing all afternoon, saw a pass intercepted by James Simpson-Daniel, who ran 35 metres to cross Newcastle's line for the third time. Paul converted and suddenly the bonus point for one more try beckoned. It was, though, the visitors who scored next. Stephenson ran through from half way for a consolation, but Wilkinson's conversion hit the post. 'It wasn't easy for him,' added Andrew. 'But he's fine. He's working his way back in and is pleased with how it is going.' </p> <p> <strong> Gloucester: </strong> Goodridge; Garvey, Fanolua, Paul, Simpson-Daniel; McRae, Gomarsall; Wood, Azam (Fortey 58), Sigley, Brown, Buxton, Hazell, Boer, Balding (Eustace 50). </p> <p><strong> Newcastle: </strong> Burke; May, Noon, Shaw (Tait 24), Stephenson; Wilkinson, Grindal (Charlton 55); Peel (Isaacson ht), Thompson (Long, ht), Hurter (Peel 63), Grimes, Gross (Hamilton 75), Setiti, McCarthy (Charvis ht), Dowson. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> A Rowden. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Stock markets have been treading water for most of the year, trading within a very narrow range with the exception of the Far East. Investors have paid the price for an over-zealous performance in the second half of 2003 after the Iraq war, when prices overstepped the mark. </p> <p>After a brisk start to the year, global indices have been running about like headless chickens for three reasons: The constant threat of geopolitical sabre-rattling; the extortionate cost of crude oil; and GDP throughout the world failing to live up to expectations - particularly in the US, where it was anticipated it would come in at 6 per cent for the first quarter. It has recently been adjusted to 2.8 per cent. Sadly the rest of the world has fed off this factor. </p> <p>Historically the run-up to the presidential election often sees shares have a decent run. Initially it generally does not matter who wins, it's a question of getting the choice of sectors right. Japan's Nikkei offers possibly the greatest opportunity of making ground by the end of the year. Though volatile there are certain sectors - banks, which have seen radical surgery, car and tech stocks - that offer serious value. </p> <p>Doubts about growth and cracks in the quality of the third-quarter earnings in the US are beginning to appear. However, there is some robustness to the economy and a re-elected or new President could provide a stimulus for equities. </p> <p>Germany's DAX suggests little growth with some tech stocks possibly offering a satisfactory denouement to the year. As for the FTSE, banks, drugs and telecoms, which constitute nearly 50 per cent of this index, have underperformed the market this year. There is little reason why their performance should significantly improve between now and 2005. However largesse could be deracinated from a flurry of M&amp;A activity.</p>",
  "<p>Scissor Sisters are midway through their set and, having identified Paris Hilton as emblematic of everything that's wrong with America, firecracker frontwoman Ana Matronic is now cursing the twisted values of Wal-Mart. The \u00fcber-retailer refuses to stock the band's self-titled album, on account of lyrical use of the words \"tits\" and \"shit\", but it will happily sell guns with which customers can mow down playgrounds of children. The crowd whoops with approval at Matronic's sweary remonstrations, then Scissor Sisters launch into another of the anthemic pop songs for which, along with polemic and performance, they've become famous. The audience - from skinny fashion kids to tops-off muscle marys, East Village arty types to middle-aged couples with matching Elton John tour T-shirts - dance in the pouring New York summer rain. </p> <p>An hour earlier, and the band are relaxing in the green room. In the corridor, there is a commotion. A group of people - mostly women and wholly beautiful - approaches. This is not simply a group, though: this is an entourage. There is Someone here. </p> <p>The Someone is Bono. With a space in his schedule between glad-handing presidents and raising awareness of pressing global issues, he has popped in to watch the gig and say hello. Not just hello, of course: he also says Scissor Sisters are the best pop band in the world. They take this in their unusually-trousered stride. It's what happens now in Scissor Sister world. In the year since their cover of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb was first released in the UK, the lives of Jake Shears, Ana Matronic, Babydaddy, Del Marquis and Paddy Boom have undergone a remarkable transformation. Their rise, from singing along to CDs in shabby-chic New York clubs to, next month, playing a sellout gig at the Royal Albert Hall, is staggeringly steep. And maybe because Shears and Babydaddy are horror film fans, it reminds you of that bit in The Silence Of The Lambs when Hannibal Lecter charts the ascent of Agent Starling, \"Getting out, getting anywhere, getting all the way to the FBI.\" </p> <p>At home in the US, they are relatively unknown beyond New York, but here Scissor Sisters are ubiquitous, you hear their record constantly in high street fashion stores. This is nothing new: there's a history of more alternative US bands making their name in the UK first - Blondie, for example. British audiences seem more willing to embrace the different and the distinctive. It helps that our music isn't as rigidly compartmentalised as America's where the dominant genres of rap, rock and country are very fixed. There's also a more cynical theory: record labels like to use the UK as a test market for new indie bands because it's cheaper here. The payoff is that British buzz is worth more than US word of mouth. </p> <p>And there has been a buzz. Scissor Sisters are good: amid manufactured pop, misanthropic rap and dull rock, they stand out as honest, different and, say it quietly, authentic. \"The radio is full of liars, blatantly dishonest people who don't care about what they're doing,\" says Babydaddy. \"They see celebrity as an end in itself. We care about what we're doing. Our goals aren't contrived. We put out something that makes sense to people. But the big trouble with getting dressed up like we do is that a lot of people think we're some kitschy throwback to the 70s, and they ignore the music. I would hope that people would listen and realise we're not that at all.\" </p> <p>Bizarrely, the band has been compared to the Village People. This is partly due to rock nerds' outrage at the Comfortably Numb cover, as well as homophobia in the music press, where there's a suspicion of bands not consisting of angst-ridden, greasy-haired, guitar-wielding indie kids. Especially one without a definite article in its name (as opposed to, say, The Thrills, The Von Bondies, The Strokes and The White Stripes). But the absence of a \"the\" makes a point, one concerning inclusivity. As Shears says of their gigs, \"There's no hierarchy. The only reason the stage is five feet off the ground is so that everyone can see us. We're all there together to have a good time. It's all one room.\" Matronic succinctly tells an audience in Brighton, \"We are Scissor Sisters and so are you.\" </p> <p>It's the antithesis of the macho posturing of cock rock, and it works. They have sold just shy of one million albums and made the summer festivals their own, attracting the largest crowd at V and wowing Glastonbury twice. They appeal to a young, urban, stylish crowd and a more MOR set, blending disco glitter with dance music exuberance, the energy of punk with classic songwriting. Older musicians are keen to court them - it's a demonstration that their fingers are still on the pulse. Before Bono's blessing, they were anointed by Elton John, who was savvy enough to invite them to support him on tour. Scissor Sisters' Take Your Mama Out has been compared to Elton's funky 70s oeuvre. Kylie has also lured them into the studio. (By now, you may have spotted a queer sensibility and, yes, Shears, Babydaddy and Marquis are gay, while Matronic has described herself as a drag queen trapped in a woman's body. In fact, Boom, the drummer, is the only straight man.) </p> <p>The songwriting partnership of Shears and Babydaddy is the fulcrum of Scissor Sisters. They're not coupley or fraternal, but they share an intimacy. Like Rodgers and Hammerstein and Lennon and McCartney, their partnership produces an alchemy. Going into the studio is, says Shears, \"food for the soul\". Babydaddy says it's Shears who writes most of the lyrics. \"Sometimes we start with a musical idea of mine, or a lyrical or melodical idea of his - it just depends.\" Shears has an affinity to pop that he's passed on to Babydaddy. \"It's something that comes really naturally to him - wanting to have the big exploding chorus.\" Shears - who is a tornado of energy, one of those people for whom the world doesn't spin fast enough - agrees that the magic songs just come: \"It happens in just one moment. A song like Laura just came out - I just sang it. It's instinct or something; I don't necessarily think you're in control, and the songs I really love are the ones I don't even feel like I've written.\" Shears says he hates getting all new age, but making music is \"a spiritual thing\", euphoric. </p> <p>Babydaddy is responsible for the lush sound, a feat all the more impressive when you know that the record was created in his tiny home studio in Brooklyn. In public at least, he is diffident about the achievement. \"I haven't listened to the album too much since we finished it, and when I do hear it I wonder how it sounds to other people. To me, it's a very primitively made album, a polished turd. We turned sounds that were imperfectly recorded on cheap equipment into something unique. I want to keep doing it that way - I have a fear of coming into money for production. I think money ruins artists. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, but the second he got big budgets, he ceased being interesting to me. There's something about the struggle that gives art its own life.\" </p> <p>As is often the way with ubiquitous things, Scissor Sisters' music may now be regarded as d\u00e9class\u00e9 in certain circles, but if you only listen, it's brilliant, bumptious - full of razor-sharp hooks, sublime lyrics and soaring choruses. </p> <p>Babydaddy and Shears met when Shears was 18, through a mutual friend who took him to visit Babydaddy in Lexington, Kentucky, his home town. \"He saw my mom's immaculately clean kitchen and got a bit frightened - as people usually do,\" says Babydaddy. They bonded over horror films and video games, and, months later, Babydaddy visited Shears at home in Seattle. \"He showed me Valley Of The Dolls, which freaked me out. And he had a full-time hooker staying with him at the time.\" </p> <p>Nothing out of the way there. Shears, born Jason Sellards, had an unusual childhood. He had his first gay relationship at 13 and came out to his parents in Las Vegas (as good a place as any, I imagine) two years later. He lived away from home for a time and had a terrible time at state school - he wore make-up and dresses, and became a target for the hatred of his mostly Mormon classmates. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he says of his early exit from the closet. \"I probably wouldn't recommend it to every gay 15-year-old, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\" </p> <p>Stronger then, Shears transferred to a private school (\"Somewhere where I could be who I was and not be scared\"), where his creativity flourished. He was \"heavily into books\", and filled stacks of jotters and notebooks with poetry and prose. Leaving school, he ventured to LA and dabbled in filmmaking, but hated it. New York beckoned. \"I knew if I hated LA, I'd love New York, and I did, but it was really challenging for a long time. I was living in a really scary place [upstairs from a crack den]. I was on the pay phone on the corner telling my mom everything was all right when I was terrified. But in New York, you can't just throw your hands up and say, 'Things aren't going well, I'm leaving.' Well, you can, but that's why you're not cut out for New York. You have to stick with it.\" </p> <p>And stick with it he did. Go-go dancing in an East Village gay bar, Shears' penchant for performing was apparent. By this time, Babydaddy (real name Scot Hoffman) was at university in the city and the pair hooked up. They had plans to organise a club night where every month they'd perform a new song. The night never came about, but they did perform at other clubs on other nights, with Shears sometimes dressed as an abortion. This is when Scissor Sisters were born, emerging from Manhattan's electroclash scene. Electroclash was a new strain of dance music that took in the androgynous, debauched electro pop excess of the early 80s and married it to the musical advances of the techno age - it's a fair classification of Scissor Sisters' early work on bijou New York label A Touch Of Class. One of the seminal electroclash records (along with Fischerspooner's Emerge, Tiga's Sunglasses At Night and Miss Kittin's Frank Sinatra), Comfortably Numb was originally the b-side of Electrobix, a song about gym obsession and body dysmorphia among gay men. But the razzmatazz surrounding electroclash always outstripped the talent involved. Judiciously, Scissor Sisters extricated themselves from the scene, which soon withered. Their scorn for fashionability and their desire to appeal to a mainstream audience saved them from the fate suffered by the likes of Fischerspooner who, through little fault of their own, were crushed under the weight of hype. In truth, Scissor Sisters were bigger than the scene from whence they came. </p> <p>One of those other nights at which Shears and Babydaddy pitched up was organised by one Ana Matronic. The theme was \"origami orgy\", and the song they performed had \"a bit of a weird Asian sound to it that we described as Sisters Of Mercy meets Cher\", says Babydaddy. \"It was called Bicycle Of The Devil, a wretched, hilarious, bizarre, gothy techno-y nightmare.\" </p> <p>Matronic (n\u00e9e Ana Lynch) \"comes from a long line of wild women\". Her grandmother was a flapper in the 20s - \"she won a best legs competition at her university\" - and her mother moved to San Francisco in the 60s, when it was the hippy destination. When she was young, Matronic always identified with the wicked queen characters in Disney films (\"the ones that turned into dragons\") and wrote songs about outsider girls with weird haircuts. Suddenly, you can see the little girl the woman used to be. \"I was raised without boundaries,\" Matronic says. \"I was told I could achieve whatever I wanted with my life, and I was always blessed with an overabundance of love and support. The difficulties I've been through mean I'm pretty good with the hard stuff. I wouldn't be the person I am without the hardships I endured.\" </p> <p>First among Matronic's hardships - and decisive in her development into the fuck-you live-and-let-live gal that she is - was her parents' divorce when she was very young. Then, when she was six, her father came out. He died of Aids when she was 15. \"My grandmother, she of the best legs, died exactly a month before my father, and I was really close to her as well. That really was the worst year of my life. I was sad more than anything that I didn't really know my father as a person. That was the hardest thing.\" </p> <p>Matronic's father was the first person to have taken her to New York City - \"Getting off that plane when I was 13 and seeing Manhattan, I knew I was going to live there one day.\" She also inherited his love of music. Her mother is a painter of religious icons and, from her, Matronic got her artistic bent. \"My mother is amazing.\" </p> <p>Leaving Portland, Oregon, for San Francisco, where her family used to live, Matronic hung out on the gay scene. She says it might have been a subconscious attempt to form a posthumous closeness to her father. She performed at Tranny Shack (\"I took my mother on 'plastic surgery disaster' night, so she's seen it all\") and got into \"that instant gratification\" that comes with performance. She moved to New York and worked on a dance music project involving mathematical principles, \"because music is very scientific\". The Golden Mean forms part of the technicolour tattoo on her arm. </p> <p>When Shears and Babydaddy asked Matronic to join their sisterhood, she didn't take much persuading. Two weeks after their first performance together - at electroclash club Luxx in Brooklyn - they were signed to A Touch Of Class. </p> <p>While leonine lead vocalist Shears slinks on stage, throwing shapes as if in an improvisational dance class, Matronic is much more calculated in her performance, the legacy of her Tranny Shack years. The focused foil to Shears' spontaneity, she prefers playing smaller crowds: having conversations with the audience and reading them poetry. \"I got my start in cramped clubs, so it feels like a return to form,\" she says. The polar opposite of the blank pop princesses who clog up the charts, Matronic is the kind of friend you'd want. She's the heart of the band, the ringmistress, the queen of proceedings. \"I do have a dream of being the first woman ever to play the Emcee in Cabaret.\" </p> <p>The trio continued to perform in scuzzy-cool, below 14th Street clubs, but there was a realisation that, to rise above their electroclash origins, they would have to recruit - specifically, a drummer and a rhythm guitarist. Auditions were held. Paddy Boom (Patrick Seacor) and Del Marquis (Derek Gruen) made the grade. </p> <p>Boston-born Boom has been playing live since 1987. He's been in three bands: \"The only steady in my whole life has been playing music.\" An earnest, honest chap, he loves the life he's living. \"Keith Richards said that being in a band was like being a teenager for ever, and it's true. This last year has been a blast. I love travelling [he spent six months on a motorbike, driving from New York to Rio], so it's the ultimate fusion of my passions.\" </p> <p>The dinky, sometimes strangely whiskered, axeman Marquis met Shears while the latter was go-go dancing, and had seen the three Sisters performing: \"Babydaddy was doing choreography; he looked like a deer in headlights.\" A week after Marquis joined their ranks, they flew to Britain to begin touring and promotional duties. Marquis knew London already and was a habitu\u00e9 of the capital's more alternative gay clubs, Popstarz and the Ghetto. Growing up in New York, he'd been obsessed with Robert Smith, Johnny Marr and the Cult's Billy Duffy: \"I was a box bedroom guitar player, striking poses in my basement.\" He describes joining the band as \"stepping on to a moving train\". </p> <p>The train shows no sign of slowing, at least not for the next few months. Poached from A Touch Of Class by Polydor, their album was released in America at the end of July. In the US, they're at the stage they were here back in February. So it's appearances on cheesy radio breakfast shows such as New York's WPLJ (\"the best mix of the 80s, 90s and today!\") and support slots on bigger tours. The night before I met them for the first time, they supported the B-52's in front of an audience of Boston \"soccer moms\". They're the first to acknowledge their uneasy, prodigal status. </p> <p>\"We're a group of people who've always felt a bit estranged from America,\" says Babydaddy. \"You don't move to New York if you feel accepted in America. I was a kid who grew up gay in a town where I never knew a single gay person; I didn't have sex until I was 19 years old. It's a conservative country, much more conservative than the UK. I do feel very American, that we've made a very American album and America is home to me, but, in a way, we're estranged.\" </p> <p>Shears concedes that their \"outrageousness\" might work against them. \"We have our subversive moments, but we're wholesome. We're worldly, but what we stand for is moral. We stand for bringing people together. I don't care what someone's political beliefs are. What we do, the music rises above that. My family is rightwing and Christian; I could still have fun with a Republican. What I hope is that someone like that can listen to our song Mary and feel something.\" Marquis, meanwhile, says that getting airplay on \"mom and dad\" radio heralds \"a tiny revolution, a bit of subversiveness in middle America\". </p> <p>Tricia Romano, columnist on the Village Voice, who has long followed Scissor Sisters' career, says \"they don't have a shot\" at America. \"When anyone is any good, I have no hope they will break through. Thanks to the morons in the middle of the country, the music scene stinks. With the presidential election, even now the country is evenly split. Do you expect these people to make sensible decisions about music? If Scissor Sisters did succeed, they'd be in bad company.\" </p> <p>Still, Shears dreams of being \"one of those big touring bands we saw when we were growing up\". Babydaddy's world was rocked at 14 when he saw a spectacular M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce concert. \"Rock'n'roll grandiosity is not foreign to me: I saw Tommy Lee ride over the crowd on his drum set.\" </p> <p>\"We started in the US,\" says Shears, \"but we couldn't really muster up enough interest here, so we went overseas. Now we're coming back here, having learnt a lot more and having developed. And you know what, we fit the American model of what a touring rock'n'roll band should be better than we did when we left.\" </p> <p>So now they're touring, from Seattle to New York (where they played to 3,000 people), Atlanta to Cleveland (where they played to 30), before returning to the UK in October for a national tour and that gig at the Royal Albert Hall. Then, of course, there's the obligatory trip to Australia and Japan. </p> <p>Inevitably, though, ricocheting across the Atlantic is taking its toll. They are tired and Shears is frustrated at playing such similar sets night after night. Yet even that is providing impetus for writing another record. They've got \"a nice little nugget of songs\", though the ever-cautious Babydaddy adds, \"There's a lot of work to be done.\" Shears continues, \"Come February [when they finish touring], we'll be 100% ready to have a life again, to get back into the studio again. Or else ...\" he pauses, \"... someone will quit,\" Babydaddy concludes, firmly. </p> <p>On a New York rooftop, Scissor Sisters look a bit weary, waiting to have their picture taken. Babydaddy is applying sunscreen and explaining that the scar on his forehead, usually hidden by his trademark trilby, is a memento of when Marquis crashed the Scissor Sisters' van last winter. Matronic is relating the joys of $29 wigs and her love of pot and chocolate. A fidgety Shears is standing on sandbags as the asphalt is too hot for his bare feet. (Shears, as anyone who has seen the band live will know, has an ambivalent relationship with clothing.) </p> <p>When the photographer is ready, the band's tiredness evaporates. They are suddenly \"on\", all pouts and posturing. Even though they're just people mostly standing still, you can't help but stare. It is a reminder of the difference between people like them and the rest of us. They are pop stars. Bright young things under the sun </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mary is released on October 11.</p>",
  "<p>Soft drinks deposit schemes in the UK have fallen out of favour because they stopped working: people no longer bring the bottles back even though there is a deposit on them (Letters, September 24). Analyses of the whole life-cycle of packaging show that recycling schemes turn out to be preferable to reuse schemes - they require less transportation and less factory space, and the individual bottles and cans can be much lighter. The material in a plastic bottle has been halved in 20 years, and cans use 25% less metal. The hurdle is ensuring that all the packaging is put out for recycling rather than simply dumped. A comprehensive system of kerbside collection would help, but there is no substitute for public education. Each citizen has to do his or her bit. Protecting the environment is not something that can be left to somebody else.<br> <strong>Richard Laming</strong><br> British Soft Drinks Association </p> <p>In Sweden, the Co-op, under its then name of Konsum, more or less single-handedly cured the bottle problem by introducing a policy in the 1970s of selling drinks only in bottles with a deposit. This practice now covers all the country's retailers, with the bottle return machines to which Keith Chambers refers accepting not only glass bottles, but also plastic bottles, all of which are sold with a return deposit. Konsum was always a leader in ethical matters. It was better placed to push its policies through than the British Co-op would be now, in that it was, and probably still is, the country's largest or second-largest food retailer.<br> <strong>Neil Muir</strong><br> Shrewsbury, Salop </p> <p>You don't need to go to Copenhagen for eco drinks.

  "<p>Twenty-three years after he vacated the Tardis with a scarf-flapping shrug of insouciance, Tom Baker has found himself occupying a unique position among the showbiz old guard. With one brogue plonked in the plush foyer of the establishment (courtesy of his career-based longevity and monumentally posh voice) and the other wedged firmly in the revolving door of anarchy (see: his involvement with Little Britain and an enduring reputation for sauciness), the actor is regarded with a fondness entirely bereft of the \"postmodern\" naffery that typically blights the children's TV veteran. While others remain pickled in the past by well-meaning fans, he's a great British eccentric, a booming bon viveur whose wit and general bonkersness ensures him an eminence that transcends mere nostalgia and becomes, instead, genuine affection, the sort that one might apply to a fond-remembered teacher or a favourite uncle. </p> <p>Baker's latest incarnation is Donald MacDonald, be-kilted brother of the late Hector (Richard Briers) in BBC1's Monarch Of The Glen. An \"aristocratic old buffer\", he galumphs and guffaws his way through the fictional Highland brae of Glenbogle, inciting all manner of cable-knitted fuss and nonsense with his unique brand of roaring irrationality. MacDonald is, of course, the latest variation on a theme (the theme basically being Tom Baker), with a panoply of attendant Bakerisms - toothsome mischief, sudden gales of deafening laughter, etc - echoing his equally galumphing, guffawing roles in Dr Who, The Life And Loves Of A She Devil and Vic &amp; Bob's shonky \"reinterpretation\" of Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased). His presence in Monarch ... may be akin to a pantomime horse with a tuba arriving at an Age Concern harp recital, but it is, as ever, good to have him back. </p> <p>It's 8am and Baker is busily rattling around his trailer, mulling over the morning papers (\"Do Scots really like the SNP? Really?\") and, being a spirited bag of beans, roaring with laughter at the drop of a fedora. \"I'm back in bed now, though!\" he booms down the blower, his voice an instantly recognisable thunderclap of tomfoolery. \"It's quite cold here in the Highlands, you know. Yeees, I'm in bed reading a book called 60 Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong because, you see, I live in France and I'm desperately trying to find out why. </p> <p>\"I've been eaten alive by midges,\" he continues, blithely charging off at a right-angled tangent. \"They've really gone for the ankles. I'm lying here rubbing my legs together like a bloody old grasshopper.\" </p> <p>Despite declaring his pins \"absolutely marvellous\", Baker has found that his knees are not what they were and now, at the grand old age of 70, finds it difficult to charge around with the gusto of yore. \"When I see someone scampering up stairs it brings tears to my eyes,\" he bellows. \"I was amazed to see an old chap in Marks &amp; Spencer the other day bend down and tie his shoelaces. I've been wearing slip-ons now for four years. In fact, I never go anywhere without a shoehorn. AH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAAAAH!!!\" </p> <p>Baker - a renowned peddler of Gallifrey-sized pork pies - describes Monarch ... as \"a particularly delicious kind of old nonsense\". In general, though, he thinks modern telly is rubbish. \"TV makes lots of people long for death,\" he sighs, thespianishly. \"It really is so formulaic and utterly predictable, dear God. I've been an actor so long, I've heard all the cliches. But then, if you tell a great cliche, people are reassured, aren't they? Playing that old alien Dr Who reassured people so much that they want to hold my hand.\" </p> <p>So enamoured was he with his powers of hand-holdery that during his spell as the beloved time lord (1974 to 1981), Baker \"left (himself) and floated about as a hero\". During this phase of transcendental self-avoidance, the avowed masochist briefly married co-star/assistant Lalla Ward, successfully vanquished the Stones of Blood (in The Stones Of Blood), drank copiously with Francis Bacon, inadvertently transformed jelly babies into playground-championed weapons of micro destruction (after an improvised scene in Planet Of Evil in which he used the humble sweet to threaten a recalcitrant resident of Zeta Minor), and found himself willingly enveloped by \"curious girls enthusiastic to lay a time lord\". Though he hated K9 (\"insufferable thing\") and was appalled by companion Leela's cave-girl costume (\"the ironies escaped me\"), he considers his stint as Britain's favourite unconvincing alien-obliterator a monumental blast: albeit a monumental blast that's now accompanied by a certain time-related weariness. It's perhaps unsurprising, then, that Baker is wary of the forthcoming series of Doctor Who, in which Christopher Eccleston - the ninth TV incarnation - will allegedly tackle \"social issues\" and \"romantic encounters\". </p> <p>\"Romance? Well, I shouldn't be surprised, really,\" snaps Baker, who once tried to murder his former mother-in-law with a hoe. \"They'll do anything to make people watch. But the Doctor was always a mystery. We know he had two hearts, but what of the rest? Four lungs, four balls and a sonic screwdriver? AH-HAH-HAH! It's best to leave people guessing.\" </p> <p>\"I read an interview with the guy who's playing Dr Who,\" he continues, audibly miffed. \"He was talking about Earth as if it was important! I was deeply, deeply disappointed. I mean, Christ, the next thing they'll be doing is talking about global warming. Oh, it's so sad, isn't it? I find a fantasy programme's preoccupation with this world so parochial.\" </p> <p>Nostalgia may trap lesser talents in the amber of their fans' childhood-rooted imaginations, but it's served Baker well, ensuring the actor frequently finds himself employed, rather than merely patronised, \"by the children who watched (Dr Who) and are now full of fondness\". Two such admirers are Little Britain's Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who borrowed his sublimely ludicrous NT roar for the similarly eccentric role of series narrator. He's evidently proud as parsley of his contribution, deeming the duo \"absurdly funny\". </p> <p>\"I like that dreadful layabout in the wheelchair,\" he barks. \"There's nothing wrong with him except he's idle. What an absolutely terrific idea!\" </p> <p>Although he claims his \"imminent death\" ensures he has \"absolutely no future\" (his lifelong morbidity has led him to erect his own pre-engraved gravestone), the truth - as is so often the case with this inveterate nonsense-monger - couldn't be further removed. Not only will he appear in the movie version of The Magic Roundabout (as misanthropic newcomer ZeBadDee), the heavily-jowled japester has also been approached with a view to turning both his brilliantly unpleasant children's story, The Boy Who Kicked Pigs, and his similarly belting autobiography, Who On Earth Is Tom Baker?, into films. \"Of course,\" he whispers, mock-conspiratorially. \"I agreed to everything. Actors always do.\" </p> <p>Does Baker - who embraced monasticism at 15 because, he claims, \"I was randy for martyrdom\" - ever suffer pangs of nostalgia? \"Yes, I find that I'm nostalgic for my youth and the time when I believed in God and loved my mother,\" he bellows. \"Of course, when I look back, I think I cheated on God a bit and I certainly could've loved my mother more. But I did my best. Yeeees,\" he muses, glumly. \"Nostalgia happens to us all, doesn't it?\"</p>",
  "A trip forward in time to Head Office, 2020. You cannot even begin to think about the new skills required of you, the new methods of getting the day's graft done, because one thing keeps nagging at you: where are the desks? And where are the people who used to sit at those desks? There seems to be just a handful of people about, gathered in small groups. Some stand as they work on handheld computers, others sit in groups, on clusters of chairs. Even the office itself is tiny. The huge glass and chrome monstrosity the company put up in the 1980s has long since been sold off - with fewer people to accommodate, there will be no need for sprawling blocks. <p>Predicting the future of work is not a science. The vision above is that of Michael White of the Policy Studies Institute, the co-author of Managing to Change, which was published as part of the Future of Work research programme. Will his prediction be any more accurate than those of some of the illustrious names who have preceeded him in foretelling the future? </p> <p>John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1930, in The Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, that by the end of the 20th century we would all be working just five hours a week. In 1996, Jeremy Rifkin soothsaid the end of work altogether. In the 21st century, he predicted, employment would be phased out, at least in the industrialised world. Jobs would be taken over by machines and workers forced on to the dole. The German sociologist Ulrich Beck, in The Brave New World of Work, published in 2000, claimed the work society was disappearing. The working environment of the future, he said, will resemble that of Brazil, with no permanent jobs, only informal and insecure labour.</p> <p>Going by current trends, Keynes's proposition is impossible and Rifkin's and Beck's seem implausible. So can we take a guess at how we will be working in 2020?</p> <p>In 16 years' time, most employment in Britain will still be structured much as it is now: the majority of us will still be working for other people, mostly in a place other than our homes, doing a job instantly recognisable today. There probably will not have been a wholesale shift to an itinerant workforce. An example from the immediate past proves the need for caution when predicting change: the fastest-growing occupation in the 90s was not software engineering (although the numbers employed in that trade grew by 185% between 1992 and 1999) or even telephone sales or business consultancy (106% and 93% respectively). The real growth industry, at a massive 302%, was the distinctly low-tech job of hairdressing.</p> <p>In the words of Richard Pearson, the director of the market research centre the Institute for Employment Studies, rather than being about sweeping changes, the future is about \"evolution, rather than revolution\".</p> <p>So how will we be working in 16 years' time? The answer, of course, is far from certain. Most of the government's peering into the future takes us only as far as 2010 - such as the work done by the Department of Work and Pensions, and the Department of Trade and Industry's Foresight team. As Alexandra Jones, a senior researcher at the Work Foundation, says, predictions past that date become \"a lot wobblier\".</p> <p>But there is some evidence to provide us with ideas. From his base in Leeds, Professor Peter Nolan runs the Future of Work programme, a huge research project which has been running under the auspices of the Economic and Social Research Council for six years and across 22 UK universities. He paints a picture of a growing divergence between those employed in highly skilled, highly paid professions, and those at the bottom of the employment chain. The economy of work, he believes, will be increasingly hourglass-shaped.</p> <p>\"At the top end of the jobs hierarchy, people are likely to enjoy substantial discretion over their hours, places and patterns of working time. But this will be fuelled by the growth of low-paid and unskilled labour, doing jobs that would have been familiar 100 years ago,\" says Nolan. He predicts managers and those in the professions will have job security. And, contrary to the predictions of futurologists, the majority of employees are likely to continue working for an organisation, rather than for themselves, or for a series of different people. In 2020 nine out of 10 jobs will still be permanent, although maybe not full time, he says.</p> <p>Flexible working is the mantra of those who seek change in the way our working lives are structured - in the first six months of this year, this newspaper alone carried 67 stories that mentioned the phrase \"flexible working\". The government has given employees the right to request flexible working patterns, and last month's Guardian/ICM poll showed a strong appetite for greater flexibility, especially among young workers. That hunger is likely to have been satisfied by 2020, by which time the way our jobs are structured will have changed massively. Many people will work as employed freelancers. People will be trained to work on a wide range of different projects, liaising with experts outside the company when additional help is needed. Companies will be smaller and more specialised. Jones says management structures and hierarchies will flatten out, giving workers more control over their jobs.</p> <p>Offices will be for \"face time\" only, when meetings in the flesh are essential, says Jones. Everything that can be done from home, will be. That will have wider benefits, too. Half the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are the result of office work - people's journeys to and from their workplace, and heating and air conditioning once they are there - according to figures from the European commission. While homeworkers will still need to keep warm, there will be much less wasted energy use.</p> <p>But our connections with our employers might actually become more profound, even if we spend less time with co-workers. We are likely to stay in our jobs for longer as we learn and develop within the company, and so become less likely to look for another job. Keeping staff is vitally important in the service sector, and Jones believes employers will finally have woken up to the paradox that to keep someone on, you need to keep developing in them precisely those skills that would equip them to leave and find a job elsewhere.</p> <p>Companies that want to retain staff will also have to take a more relaxed attitude to time. Jones envisages careers being seen as a landscape, with peaks and valleys of working hours, allowing the young to work longer, those with families to work less, and retirement to be phased in gradually. All workers, not just those with children, will be allowed to take time out to study or travel. Inevitably, that would require us to manage our own careers and finances, particularly securing our pension provision.</p> <p>John Cridland, the deputy director general of the CBI, agrees. He thinks that by 2020 there will be no fixed hours, or job descriptions: everything will be up for negotiation. \"This will definitely be the case with managerial and professional jobs, but also in other service jobs too. Obviously you need staff in a restaurant at the same time as customers, but provided the basics are covered, there'll be no point in having lots of people with the same set of skills.\"</p> <p>More jobs will be open to more people as well. White hopes that by 2020 every other person working would be a woman, particularly in senior roles, \"although I think it's unlikely to be 50-50 by then\", he says. While gender parity will not yet be a reality, women in the 2020 workplace will be better able to realise their career aspirations. \"Put it this way, it's going to have to change because women are just not going to put up with things like glass ceilings in the future,\" says Nolan.</p> <p>That process will be aided by men playing a greater role in caring for their children and their parents: by 2021 there will be 12 million people over the age of 65, so the burden of care will have to be more evenly shared. Instead of men working 60 hours a week and women working 20, it is likely that many couples will opt to split the workload, as well as their responsibilities at home - so we could well see both partners choosing to work a 35-hour week, with the costs of additional care subsidised by the government. Care provision will be another area in which employers see the chance to build loyalty among their staff. Workplace nurseries will be more common, and technology will boost parental confidence in them, with webcams allowing mothers and fathers to check on their children whenever they choose.</p> <p>It will not only be women who secure higher status in the workplace. There are already a million disabled people who say they want to work, according to the Disability Rights Commission, and that figure will grow as the workforce ages - particularly as disability includes conditions such as diabetes and severe heart problems, as well as long-term depression. In the sardine-tight labour market of 2020, that will be a group employers will not be able to ignore.</p> <p>Cridland feels more progress will also have been made towards racial integration in the workplace. \"For instance, many African-Caribbean male teenagers have a greater tendency to rebel and opt out of education when they are younger, although they go back into learning when they are older,\" he says. \"Some employers are already realising they need to do more outreach work to get to these groups: in a tight labour market, and as service sector employers realise they need employees who reflect the communities where they work, they really need to attract them as employees.\"</p> <p>There may also be more Pakistani and Bangladeshi women at work by 2020. Those two groups are currently badly underrepresented in the workforce, but research from Manchester University suggests that more of these women, particularly those with qualifications, will want jobs.</p> <p>Older people, too, will be more prevalent in the workplace. Jones says the likely retirement age by 2020 will be 70, and many future-watchers predict that will rise even further - not only to counter the pensions crisis, but also to release the pressure on the labour market.</p> <p>Nolan, however, disputes the notion that older people would stay on at work out of choice. \"That's fine if you're a lawyer or company director where you can pick and chose your hours and projects,\" he says, \"but if we're talking about someone who's been working in a factory for 40 years, do you really think that they'd want to carry on for another five?\"</p> <p>The real beneficiaries of the changing nature of the workplace will be those who have low levels of skills but can none the less master technology, predicts White. At the moment, the opportunities open to those people may be no more exciting than working in a call centre, but new technologies should open up other possibilities. Cridland agrees, adding that everyone will be better qualified (by 2010 there will be 2m fewer jobs that require only GCSEs, for example), so employees will be valued for their skills rather than just for turning up. If they cannot master technology, however, the least skilled will have to settle for supporting the freer lifestyles of the their better-paid peers. And many, reckons Richard Pearson of the IES, will be forced to take second jobs.</p> <p>Outsourcing, the issue currently animating both the incumbent and the aspirational president in the US, will continue. Reservation agents, computer programmers, database managers, financial analysts - all those whose jobs that depend, in part, on an ability to master repetitive tasks performed on a computer - will have been relocated abroad. \"Only the customer-facing jobs will be left,\" says Cridland.</p> <p>But, he points out, the lost jobs will be replaced with shiny new ones, more suitable to our developing economy. He points to the banking giant HSBC, which creates two jobs for every one it sends offshore. </p> <p>The bottom line about work, of course, is that we do it for money. Those who do it for hard cash in the hand might not be happy about some of the changes ahead: identity cards and the decreasing use of cash will make back-pocket payments harder, in effect formalising the black economy. That will, however, be a positive for those people, mainly women, who work off the books not to avoid tax but because their employers want to avoid giving them full employment benefits. The minimum wage is also likely to increase, and childcare and housework are likely to attract tax breaks, meaning people can afford to pay their nanny and cleaner more.</p> <p>Ian Hopkinson, the head of employment tax at KPMG, thinks salaries will consist of totally flexible remuneration packages: we will be able to choose between pay and a combination of benefits, such as buying days off. While this is already happening in some workplaces, it will be the norm by 2020. He adds that while there are still likely to be behemoth salaries paid to City executives, wages will be far more transparent. Sadly, he also thinks it unlikely that teachers or nurses will see radical increases in their relative salaries. \"These are likely to remain in the private sector and future governments aren't going to be able to afford to pay them huge amounts,\" he says.</p> <p>Public sector workers will still negotiate their pay collectively, through trades unions. But in the private sector, where only 18% of the workforce now carries a membership card, the unions will have been transformed into professional service organisations.</p> <p>\"This needn't just be about providing things like insurance,\" says Cridland. \"The downside of negotiating individual contracts is that you're not protected by collective bargaining. Unions in the future are likely to step in to assist individual members to negotiate pay.\"</p> <p>The presence of more women in senior positions and in better-paid professions means the gender pay gap will narrow, but it will not disappear. \"For that to happen would require a major revaluation of the contribution of women at work. We'd have to see the political will for things to change,\" says Alastair Hatchett, the head of pay services at Incomes Data Services.</p> <p>The Work Foundation predicts there will be a major revaluation, however, in the measurement of work. Some method will be found to measure output - the number of books edited or meals served - rather than input, the number of hours spent at your desk, it says. Others, however, are more sceptical. Pearson says: \"Theoretically it's a good idea for output to be measured rather than input but in reality, for the majority of jobs, it just isn't possible to evaluate in an equitable and affordable way. You start getting into value judgements - how do you judge that the output of one person editing a book is better than that of another?\"</p> <p>Finally, to the most important question. Will we be happy in our jobs? Sadly, in spite of all the corporate attempts to woo us, and the chance to work from home a couple of days a week, it seems likely we will be as discontent as ever.</p> <p>\"People are being more intensely critical and demanding about everything. They expect more from their jobs. It could be harder for companies to make people satisfied: they'll do what they think necessary to make people committed and content, but I think they just won't be quick enough on the work-life balance issues,\" predicts Michael White. It seems the technological advances pictured by Keynes may not bring us joy. Look on the bright side though: at least we'll be able to discuss our woes via video-imaging, rather than by standing around the water cooler.</p>",
  "The past 30 years has been a generation of dramatic change in the shape of family life. That pace will not be continued in the next 20. <p>The next two decades will be a period in which already well-established trends are consolidated. That is the consensus among researchers. And all are agreed that by 2020 it will be very hard to talk of a \"typical family\", such will be the variety of shapes and types of families.</p> <p>The most marked characteristic of families since the 1960s has been that the traditional conception of the British family has disintegrated. The married couple with 2.4 children is disappearing. The sequence of life events - marriage, sex and children - has been radically reordered. Marriage rarely comes first and increasingly does not happen at all. Over the past 30 years, levels of cohabitation have trebled, the number of babies born outside marriage has quintupled, and the number of single-parent families has trebled. </p> <p>The most dramatic change, however, has been to the \"happy ever after\" bit in the picture of family life. In the past 30 years, the rate of divorce has doubled; and half of all children now experience their parents' divorce before they are 16. </p> <p>All four trends - cohabitation, divorce, births outside marriage and single parents - are likely to be even more pronounced by 2020. There is no evidence that any of them are easing. Much has been made of the fact that the divorce rate appears to have reached a plateau - Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe - but it is still rising in first marriages. Cohabitation arrangements are even more likely to break down than marriages. So what will be accepted as a general rule of family life in 2020 will be the brittle nature of the core relationship between the parents. </p> <p>\"There have been 20 years of dramatic change and the diversity of family structures is much greater. The proportion of single-parent families will probably continue to bob around 20%, but there will probably be more stepfamilies in the future,\" says David Utting of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who is also one of the authors of The Handbook of Parenting.</p> <p>While the underlying trends reshaping families will not change, our attitudes to those trends will. The recent period of revolutionary upheaval will bed down into social acceptability. The stigma that used to surround divorce and illegitimacy will be a subject only for the history books. Gay and lesbian partnerships, with rights enshrined in law, will no longer prompt comment. Family life will have adjusted to a pattern of serial monogamy, with a much larger number of stepfamilies. Lone parenthood will be a common phenomenon, but not necessarily a long-lasting one: on average, single parenthood lasts five years now, but that could drop lower by 2020 as the \"churn rate\" of relationship breakdown increases. </p> <p>The diversity of family forms will be striking by 2020. Children living with both their biological parents in the same household will be in the minority. There will be dozens of different types of co-parenting arrangements, with combinations of stepfamilies, or adults with children from previous relationships entering long-term relationships with others in the same position but choosing not to live together.</p> <p>From the vantage point of 2020, there will be some amusement at the heated debates this scenario inspired at the turn of the century. Talk of family breakdown will cause wry smiles as people attribute the kind of moral panic seen in the late 20th century to a particular kind of centennial angst. At least, that is the view of Christina Hardyment, author of The Future of the Family. She argues that the overriding picture is not so much one of family breakdown as of a radical restructuring that allows for just as much emotional commitment as ever.</p> <p>\"There is an alternative view to the doom-laden prophesy that families are falling apart,\" says Hardyment. \"In fact, the future of the family is stronger than ever - all the research shows that families are hugely valued and will continue to be.\"</p> <p>That is borne out by successive British Social Attitude Surveys, which show clearly that while family members live further apart, they turn to each other when important life events take place. Hardyment points to the fact that families are still responsible for the bulk of socialising in British life and that family members talking to each other account for a large proportion of telephone usage. For Hardyment, the most important factor is that \"the relationship between adults is chosen rather than one of economic necessity. That's a tremendous change in the basis of the relationship.\"</p> <p>One of the most dramatic social changes of the past 30 years has been in women's patterns of employment. In the UK the proportion of women in full-time employment has trebled in the past 30 years and maternal employment has leapt from 57% to 65% during the 1990s. With their new economic power, women are able to negotiate more equal relationships - already one in five women earn more than their partners. That proportion is likely to increase over the next decades as a generation of high-achieving schoolgirls arrives in the labour market. Women now make up more than half the intake of traditional professions such as law and medicine. </p> <p>The norm in families now is for one male full-time worker and one female part-time. By 2020, more women will be the primary breadwinner, though that shift will be restricted by the fact that while earning power is being redistributed within the heterosexual couple, caring responsibilities have proved more resistant to change. A disproportionate amount of housework and childcare is still done by women. </p> <p>This renegotiation of the economics of the couple is what the social theorist Anthony Giddens celebrated as the \"pure relationship\" in his Reith Lectures of 1999. He heralded a new era for the family as the old structures of patriarchy, duty and deference crumble to give way to a more democratic model between partners, and between parents and their children. Giddens argued that \"individualisation\" - how people define their identity - shapes family experiences, as people choose to develop only those relationships that promise them emotional integrity. </p> <p>Fiona Williams has led the Care, Values and the Future of Welfare research project at Leeds University for five years. She argues that Giddens' thinking has overstated the extent to which people are atomistic individuals who seek fulfilment in personal relationships. \"There may be seriality in sexual relationships, but that doesn't lead to fragmentation of the family,\" she says. \"People will have different experiences over their lifetimes - of marriage, of cohabitation, of single parenthood - but in many of them they are negotiating complex and deeply held commitments.\" </p> <p>In fact, the major characteristic of the 21st-century family is that the relationship between parents and children has been charged with a much greater intensity, commitment and pleasure. \"Parenting has gained in political, economic and emotional significance,\" says Williams. \"Parents and children have more emotional investment in each other. The issue is the quality of the relationship, not just its functionality. Children and their parents talk of each other as friends whom they can talk to - now, fathers want as much of that quality of relationship as mothers have. The relationship between parents and children has got stronger.\"</p> <p>What goes along with the greater emotional investment is a longer financial dependency. Children used to be off their parents' hands by 18, but the combination of student loans, university fees and rising property prices has already reversed that, and the trend is likely to continue. Parenthood is well on its way to becoming a minimum 25-year deal. The way generations in the family are connected by vertical links is sometimes characterised as the \"beanpole family\" - long and thin. As family sizes shrink, the number of siblings and cousins will dwindle while the intergenerational relationships become more intense. That beanpole family will present the state with some particular challenges in the 2020s, adds Williams. The strength of the parent-child relationship might mean that today's children will expect a lot of support from the state to care for their aged parents. Meanwhile, grandparents will want to help with the care of their grandchildren but will have to carry on working to fund their pensions. </p> <p>Many researchers believe the past 30 years have seen not so much the breakdown of the family as its reinvention. The baby-boomers adapted family structures in line with their aspirations to autonomy, self-definition and emotional integrity. Over the course of a generation, they have taken the family unit apart rather as a car mechanic might an engine. The great shibboleths of western family life have been dismantled: sex and marriage used to be interlinked - as did marriage and children, as did heterosexuality and marriage. Those links have been broken and people can assemble the bits as they wish: the worth accorded to individual autonomy has hugely increased and will continue to grow. </p> <p> Despite the moral panic generated by these shifts, one aspect of the reinvented family that has been less controversial - in relative terms - has been the delinking of genetic material and parenthood. Donated semen to help couples in which the man is infertile has been used since the 1960s, and donated eggs are a common part of infertility treatment. Test-tube babies and surrogate mothers are no longer a novelty. What has been firmly established is that parenthood does not always entail direct genetic inheritance; the bonding and strength of relationship is not determined by common genetic material. </p> <p>But the strong resistance in British public opinion to some developments of reproductive technologies - such as cloning and choosing a baby's characteristics, the creation of so-called designer babies - shows no sign of abating. By 2020, the techniques to develop a cloned embryo will almost certainly exist (the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has already given a centre in Newcastle the go-ahead to begin research) and will probably be practised elsewhere in the world. It will be almost impossible for the government to prevent people becoming fertility tourists, travelling to find the treatment they want. But it is a moot point as to whether public opinion will have shifted to allow parents these choices in their own country.</p> <p>The baby-boomers' reinvention of family has ensured that increasingly there will be no collective narrative about how intimate relationships should be structured and the order in which major life events should unfold. Adulthood will not carry with it expectations of achieving certain relationship milestones, such as getting married or becoming a parent. But while the options for personal freedom will have been enormously enlarged, that will bring with it a degree of confusion and disorientation, because individuals' wishes are sure, in many cases, to conflict: to have children or not; to marry or not; to stick together or separate. Without norms, some individuals will happily negotiate their way through the choices, but others will find it more difficult. </p> <p>Despite the rising tolerance of relationship breakdown and divorce, there is still a tremendous attachment to the ideal of a stable, lifelong commitment, points out Mary MacLeod, chief executive of the National Family and Parenting Institute. The vast majority of people tell surveys they want to spend their life with one other person. Children, in particular, are very attached to living in a household with both their mother and father. MacCleod acknowledges it is \"troubling\" that, in effect, children's expectations of family life are not, and increasingly will not be, met. There is some evidence we are getting better at divorcing - there is still a long way to go - but there is no getting away from the fact that the serial monogamy of the future will be disruptive and difficult for children. Research has already shown that children of divorced parents have, on average, a lower rate of educational achievement and higher incidence of mental health problems in adulthood. There will be increasing pressure on couples to achieve a \"good divorce\" for the sake of their children.</p> <p>The increased freedom of the reinvented family has also brought a doubling in single-person households and a sharp rise in the proportion of childless women. In part, these developments are attributable to increased choice but, in part, it is the cost that is paid for choice. In a significant minority of people's lives by 2020, family will not play a major role and friendship will be much more important in these people's emotional lives. Those friendships may often entail strong commitment to mutual support so friends can help each other through life crises. For many in 2020, \"significant others\" will be as likely to refer to a few close friends as a husband or mother. </p> <p>But the attenuated family structures will leave some vulnerable. Loneliness and depression will be more common, and some groups, such as the elderly, will be particularly vulnerable. As geographical mobility continues to spread families over greater distances and the smaller family size increases the dependency of the elderly on their one or two children, loneliness in the final decades of our longer lives will be a huge issue. Given that women live longer than men, they will be disproportionately affected; by 2020 we will be discussing the feminisation of loneliness and searching for strategies to develop greater peer sociability to compensate. </p> <p>The ageing of the British population by 2020 will be a major political and social issue - the number of people over pensionable age will increase from 10.9 million now to 13.2million in 2026. But the workers of 2020 will be bracing themselves for an even older age profile when they retire, because we are expected to reach the peak of 15 million pensioners in 2040. </p> <p>We know we will work for longer and live for longer. But the big unknown is how the medical treatment and care we need in our old age will be financed. Utting points to research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that indicates that by 2020 the funding implications for care will be acute. Will taxes have to rise to pay for the number of heart operations needed for octogenarians? These will be the dilemmas for the electorate in the 2020s. Alongside financing the huge costs of medical treatment will be the enormous challenge of funding the much more prosaic matter of caring for the frail elderly - dressing them, cooking their meals, doing their housework and helping them to wash. By 2020, we will be in the middle of the debate on the care deficit. This could be the single most difficult issue facing the family in the 21st century. </p> <p>Historically, women were responsible for care within the family. They raised the children and cared for the elderly according to the traditional, early-20th-century model. But the transfer of their labour from the family to the paid economy has opened up a care deficit. That is one part of family life the baby-boomers singularly failed to reinvent. Women are still expected to take on the bulk of the care responsibilities within the family and some research indicates that men (particularly those in professional jobs) are now doing fewer household chores and less childcare than they did 20 years ago. What is fuelling the care deficit is the growing pressure of long hours at work. The number of long-hour workers in the UK has doubled in the past five years to 26% of the workforce. </p> <p>At the moment, the centre of the debate over the care deficit is how to care for children, which is likely to be a major issue at the next general election as demand grows on the state to step in and help families with this part of the care deficit. As birth rates decline dramatically in countries such as Spain and Italy, the European Union will add to the domestic pressure in the UK for the government to adopt family-friendly policies, including state childcare provision and greater encouragement for flexible working. By 2020, it is possible that the childcare question will have been solved - there will be enough provision and the state will ensure it's affordable - but another part of the care deficit, the care of the elderly and chronically ill, will be provoking much greater concern. </p> <p>On every aspect of the care deficit over the coming decades, people will turn to technology for help. Japan, which has the highest proportion of those over 60 in the world, has already pioneered the kind of remote, web-based technology that can administer health checks such as taking a pulse rate and measuring blood pressure. There will be moves to further extend the role of technology in providing care.</p> <p>Webcams might by 2020 be playing the role the telephone did in the 20th century, a vital communication link for families who might live hundreds of miles apart. Already some nurseries are linked up to their parents' office by webcam so they can see their children at play. More and more communication within the family is likely to be mediated by technology - the internet, email or the mobile phone. Already, technology has facilitated the family life of people who have migrated from their home country. For example, a South African nurse working in the UK can now be involved in daily decisions about the upbringing of her children and care of her parents. Involvement in family life no longer requires geographical proximity.</p> <p>Technology will alleviate some of the loneliness arising from the care deficit, but it can offer few solution to the basics of sustaining a person's daily life. There have been suggestions that robots could be programmed to respond to a baby's crying and that they could play a role in the care of tiny babies. But there will be strong cultural reservations about such an idea, reinforced by the emerging research on the importance of affection towards babies in the development of their brains in the first year, so it is hard to see robot nannies being a major feature of family life. </p> <p>The big problem in 2020 will be to find the workforce to meet the care needs of families. It is predicted that by 2020 the US will absorb the entire global workforce of nurses, such will be the demand of its ageing population for medical care. It will be able to offer high enough wages to poach them from all over the world. </p> <p>The declining birth rate in many European countries - Britain's has been declining also but at a slower rate - will post the acute problem of finding enough people to care for their ageing populations. Perhaps governments will finally have to tackle the chronic low pay and low status of care work to recruit sufficient numbers. Or perhaps they will adopt the short-term solution of importing care, allowing women migrant workers on short-term contracts to staff our nurseries, old people's homes and hospitals.</p> <p>We do not yet know. But whatever course policymakers choose, they - and we - face some tough challenges.</p> <p><b>Madeleine Bunting is a Guardian columnist and the author of Willing Slaves: How the Overwork Culture is Ruling Our Lives (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99)</b></p>",
  "<p>Rarely has a question of such great topical import exercised my family quite so vigorously. Never have the relatively inconsequential issues of fox-hunting, Fathers 4 Justice or global warming seemed so superfluous to the grand scheme of things, when what currently matters far more at grassroots level is the very pressing issue - need I remind you? - of choosing a name for the new Blue Peter kitten. The nation waits. It is on tenterhooks. </p> <p>I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that there will be little sleep for a concerned viewing public until the quest to find a suitable moniker for the dear little ginger and white bundle has been resolved. Anyone who doubts that thinking of names for cats is a reasonable subject for national debate should take it up with one of the scores of grateful parents who send up a short prayer to Biddy Baxter every time the opening bars of the Blue Peter theme tune fill the house three times a week at 5pm. </p> <p>In an uncertain world, Blue Peter represents a touchstone of childhood innocence and stability. It exists as a welcome reminder that issues surrounding children aren't solely to do with obesity, drugs, underage pregnancy, precocious makeup-wearing and self-harming. Steadfastly and intelligently, it sticks to a virtually unchanged formula without ever seeming out of touch or stuffy. </p> <p>Pivotal to its success is an anchor team made up of the most wholesome individuals since Mary and Joseph pitched up at Bethlehem. The fact that Liz is currently heavily pregnant is, you feel, as likely to be the result of some sort of divine televisual intervention as any other, more traditional method. Certainly, the thrice-weekly menu, unlike most other, puerile children's shows, is always studiedly free of filth, corruption and innuendo. You know, for instance, that when they include an item on the Braemar Highland Games, there will be no double entendres around the subject of caber-tossing. There will be a blissful absence of salacious sniggering about what may or may not lurk beneath Simon and Matt's kilts. </p> <p>Back in the studio, any instances of demonstrative bottom-nosing on the part of the assembled pets will be tactfully panned over by the camera-man. Most importantly for parents, who these days feel it essential to police afternoon television for signs of violence, smut and plain dim-wittedness, if Blue Peter's on, they know their children won't be watching any of the cookery, DIY or similarly deadly makeover dross on the other channels. </p> <p>And yet, I have to admit that my faith was rocked to the very core last week as I watched, transfixed and a little horrified, as Liz demonstrated how to make a fringed poncho out of a baby's cot blanket. First, I wondered about the wisdom of Blue Peter's \"makes\" section branching out into clothes. Second, it occurred to me that the programme isn't completely blameless when it comes to dumbed-down television. If one were looking to trace the origins of the ceaseless torrent of dire home-improvement shows, the buck would probably stop at Blue Peter's door. </p> <p>Surely it is almost solely responsible for introducing a generation of children to craft techniques, and the creative empowerment that comes with knowing how to use double-sided tape, sticky-backed plastic and a tub of Copydex. For this sort of educative conscientiousness it should be applauded, but who could predict that the same viewers who grew up making father's day gifts out of washing-up liquid bottles, coat hangers and Mum's old pants would, as adults, progress to staple guns, jigsaws and MDF and be deluded enough to think they could apply those same slap-and-paste techniques to their own houses? </p> <p>The horrible moment of truth for many must surely come when they have made an unholy mess of rag-rolling the fireplace surround, only to realise that there isn't a fallback scenario facilitated by \"the one I made earlier\". The harsh lesson is that confident craftwork as a child doesn't necessarily translate into competent adult DIY skills. Just because you once made Sindy's kitchen and Tracy Island out of some old shoe boxes, it doesn't mean similar principles can be employed to tart up the guest room. Likewise cooking. John Noakes's bird cake represented a seminal culinary moment for many children my age. Valerie Singleton's coconut ice inspired a generation of fledgling cooks long before Delia whisked up her first egg white. But although it made us more confident and experimental in the kitchen, it also spawned mouthy gobshites such as Ainsley Harriott, which isn't something to be proud of. </p> <p>This is why I worry about Liz's poncho moment last week. So far, dressmaking is virtually the only gentle leisure pursuit to have escaped the bawdily vacuous TV makeover treatment, possibly dismissed as not sexy enough for telly, too laborious and matronly, with not enough potential for hilarious cock-ups and resulting marital discord. I am glad. For me, sewing is representative of solitary, therapeutic endeavour, and should remain that way. Start making ponchos on Blue Peter and who knows where it will lead? Given that the result of Liz's efforts last week was, perhaps by design, an unequivocal fashion disaster, I have a sneaking suspicion that she is with me on this one.</p>",
  "On a short concrete jetty in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a dozen judges and court officials took their first steps on Pitcairn Island yesterday, helped by the very people they have been sent to judge. <p>It was a hot, calm day and people wore shorts and T-shirts while legal documents, food supplies, books and people were handed down from a sleek white yacht and ferried to shore in longboats and dinghies. </p> <p>The lawyers are here to try seven Pitcairn men - four of them direct descendants of the mutineers on HMS Bounty, who settled on the island in 1790 in flight from a British naval court-martial - who have been charged with 96 counts of sexual abuse. </p> <p>The charge sheet stretches from the 1960s to 1998 and includes 31 counts of rape, as well as charges for indecent assault, gross indecency on a child and unlawful sexual intercourse. </p> <p>The remains of HMS Bounty still lie 10ft beneath the breaking surf, just a stone's throw from the Bounty Bay jetty where the judges disembarked. Two mutineers set fire to it in 1790 as a final severance of links with the outside world, but today British law is back on Pitcairn with a vengeance. </p> <p>Residents claim that the trial could result in the abandonment of this 2 sq mile British territory 4,000 miles from the nearest continent, after 214 years of almost continuous occupation. </p> <p>\"The Pitcairn people want justice, but they would like a justice that does not tear their island completely apart,\" says Herb Ford, director of the US-based Pitcairn Islands Study Centre. \"This trial done in this traditional downtown London mode is going to rip this place so far apart that you're going to be lucky to see anyone on Pitcairn a year or two from now.\" </p> <p>The sea was calm and the sky dappled with broken cloud yesterday, but Pitcairn's rocky coastline can be so windswept and treacherous that visitors and supplies must be ferried between the jetty and boats moored offshore. Many residents fear that these supply missions would be impossible if more than half of Pitcairn's able-bodied men were locked up inside the newly-constructed Adamstown jail. </p> <p>Publicity surrounding the five-year investigation and trial process has already damaged Pitcairn's image as a south sea paradise, but it has been many years since life here was the simplistic idyll praised in Victorian sermons. </p> <p>Locals get around on quad bikes and live in prefab bungalows. Diesel fuel to power the islands generators and vehicles make up the bulk of the supplies brought in from passing freight ships. </p> <p>All but a handful of Pitcairners have visited New Zealand, Australia, Europe or the US. Most houses have internet connections and exchange a steady flurry of emails with friends and relatives in the outside world. Pitcairn's primary school teaches the New Zealand syllabus, and children usually go to secondary schools in Auckland. </p> <p>But the population has dropped from a high of 200 in 1936 to just 47 now, alongside seven outsiders working as police, social workers, administrators, doctors and pastors. The 25 lawyers, officials and journalists attending the trial will push Pitcairn's population to its highest level since the 1960s. </p> <p>Islanders argue that they are still relatively green to the ways of the outside world. </p> <p>\"They come out for a few months to visit relatives and for medical treatment, but they are mostly in their Pitcairn environment with relatives out here,\" says Kari Young, a Norwegian-born Pitcairner who divides her time between Auckland and Pitcairn. \"They don't live the New Zealand life, they don't get much involved in the big politics.\" </p> <p>This disconnect is at the heart of the dispute over Pitcairn's law. Islanders say they have their own legal system, which dates to an 1838 constitution, has been used to try hundreds cases on the island and is contained in a 1971 book of legal code traditionally kept in the island office. </p> <p>They argue that the 1956 British sexual offences act, under which the seven defendants will be tried next week, is usurping laws that have been dealing with sexual offences on Pitcairn since the 1960s. The most recent such case was in 1999, when a 19-year-old New Zealander was sentenced to 100 days imprisonment for \"having carnal knowledge\" of a 15-year-old girl. That trial sparked the investigation, led by Kent policewoman Gail Cox, that has now landed seven islanders in Adamstown's dock. </p> <p>Islanders have pushed for some form of restorative justice to be taken, but the option has been turned down by governor Richard Fell.</p> <p>\"Because this has gone so far, the police and Pitcairn governor have to show some results, no matter how much it hurts the community,\" wrote one island resident, who did not wish to be identified, in an email to the Guardian this week. \"Since 1999 Pitcairn laws have been disregarded and English ones put in place, usually without Pitcairn input or practicality,\" she wrote.</p> <p>\"We are not a metropolitan city or even somewhere you can usually 'liken' our living conditions to. When a new problem came up [in the past] a new ordinance or law was put in place. In short I think the whole set of laws we have now are a farce.\" </p> <p>The bulk of the charges are believed to relate to underage sex, and most locals admit that sexual customs in Pitcairn have traditionally been different to those in Britain. But islanders point to the worldwide variation in age of consent laws, which are as low as 12 and 13 in Spain and parts of Latin America, and argue that to bring the full force of British justice to bear on Pitcairn is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. </p> <p>There are also deep concerns about the conduct of the three-year investigation. Several witnesses have withdrawn their statements after claiming that they had been coerced by New Zealand police and offered compensation as an incentive, in one case resulting in a complaint from the Norwegian ambassador. </p> <p>British law has only ever been used in one previous criminal case on Pitcairn, the murder trial of Harry Christian in 1897. Islanders say it was only invoked on that occasion because the island's legal code - much of which is concerned with seemingly trivial issues such as the correct way to kill a chicken - had no laws dealing with murder. </p> <p>\"All through the 200 years it's been the Pitcairn law book that has ruled the island,\" says Kari Young. \"That's all the Pitcairners have ever known. It was kept in the office and everyone could go and leaf through it. Until quite recently there's never been a British law book there.\" </p> <p>There is a clause in the 1971 legal code mentioning that British law applies in Pitcairn, but islanders say they had no means of referring to statutes passed 9,300 miles away until a full set of British law books was brought to the island in 2001. The trial, they argue, violates the legal principle of \"nulla poena sine lege\" (no punishment without a law). </p> <p>Arguments over the legality of the trial have raged in New Zealand courtrooms - reconsecrated as Pitcairn's supreme court and court of appeal - for nearly two years. The dispute will go before the Privy Council in London next month, but Pitcairn supreme court justice Russell Johnson said the appeal would not be likely to succeed. </p> <p>\"You'll be asking the Privy Council, in the death throes of the British Empire, to overturn the colonial law which has applied forever,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>It was 2am. I'd been in Melbourne for 24 sleepless hours and was still wide-awake, feeling as though I were missing out on the essential glamour of a Lost In Translation moment because my low-rise hotel didn't have views of the city. Instead of raiding the mini-bar, I went for a nightcap at a sleepy local pub called Rush - a misnomer if ever there was one. Rain came down in Hollywood torrents, the wind whipped up and I began to question the wisdom of leaving Blighty's so-so summer for Melbourne's grey winter. </p> <p>At three-ish, I returned to the Lyall Hotel - a triumph of beige suede over good taste - turned the TV on and thought I was hallucinating when a woman said, in all seriousness: \"I've had an iconic wardrobing experience.\" Iconic? Wardrobing? </p> <p>Later, in a restaurant, I was told that eggs benedict, \"is our iconic dish, you'll be sure to have a fine-dining experience.\" Melbourne feels strangely Parisian, New York-ish and San Franciscan. It's because of the street cafes and news vendors, towers, grid system and trams - a beguiling urban identikit that makes for an attractive whole. There's also a hint of LA, in the wealthy suburb of South Yarra, and of course a splash of Ramsay Street elsewhere. </p> <p>Cranes stand all over the place, saluting building sites like so many anorexic Statues of Liberty, gaudy lights winking at the top of their extended arms. If it was possible to plump-up, Botox or lift a city's visage, then I'd describe Melbourne's face as well and truly tucked; it's had radical surgery. Squeaky and new, the good-looking veneer pulled tight, it has been thoroughly made-over, giving new life to its Victorian past. </p> <p>New people, too, like Hank, a Dutchman who speaks \"Strine\" with a Flemish drawl and wears crimson patent leather ankle boots and maroon socks with tweeds - a dazzling combo. As the proprietor of the Aboriginal Gallery of Dreamings, or AGOD, he is on a crusade to promote and, of course, flog Aboriginal art. </p> <p>Many people, Hank included, claim a very personal stake on Aboriginal artists and tell tales of how they personally encouraged, discovered or promoted certain individuals. It's as if Aboriginal art has become totemic in itself - a white totem, a middle-class badge of liberal respectability. Some of the artists Hank represents are extraordinary, as is his apparent grasp of the symbolism, nuance and intricacy of the different native cultures and styles. His enthusiasm is infectious, he's a man possessed, evangelical and verging on the combustible. I was entranced and had to steel my resolve to escape without buying anything - there again, if I'd had a spare A$100,000 the story might have been quite different. </p> <p>A quick escape wasn't easy, the pedestrians in Melbourne are probably the best behaved in the world and patiently wait in orderly queues for the green man to flash. I'm unused to such municipal obedience. </p> <p>Victoria's capital does weekends better than any other days of the week. Wealthy locals might drive up to Daylesford, a peculiar town that is famed for an unlikely combination of health spas, a large gay community and locally grown organic food - produced no doubt by the lesbian WI after an invigorating salt-scrub. It's also home to the chi-chi Lake House Hotel and its second- to-none wine cellar. Owner Alla Wolf-Tasker, a terrifying woman gated behind enormous spectacles and a shock of big black hair, extolled the virtues of all who worked for her, including the groundsman. \"He's the Australian shooting champion, and often takes out guests,\" she said. I know how he must feel, and regret not having the use of a sawn-off shotgun myself. </p> <p>For those who remain in town, Melbourne is a city that brunches - conspicuously so. Small groups of Melbournites, box fresh, newly streaked and well-shod, ruminate together on Chapel Street below the evocative, colonial Victorian shop facades before making their choice of restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, all the swanky eateries are full; smoked salmon &amp; scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, bagels and croissants filling, in turn, the diners. It's inevitably a family affair - children, very much part of Melbourne's culture of youth, feature heavily - an almost Mediterranean mentality. </p> <p> T hose hungering for culture are catered for, too: a leisurely amble to Federation Square does the trick. The newly built arts centre and public space is unremittingly hideous from the outside, but quite stupendous within. Fabulous interiors are splintered, labyrinthine and engaging, a bit like walking into a film maker's version of an art space: huge galleries with a permanent and excellent exhibition of Aboriginal art are beautifully hung and lit. And with hardly any punters to spoil the view, the space becomes even more airy and dreamy. I momentarily shudder as the words iconic and experience pop into my head. </p> <p>The good denizens are as proud of Federation Square as they are of the municipality in general. I got a powerful sense not just of community, but of care for the environment, too - the streets are incredibly clean. Likewise I felt the standard of living was high, the happiness threshold was regularly tipped and general satisfaction quotient was sated. Melbourne's history of radical trade unionism and politics somehow doesn't come across to the casual visitor enveloped in overwhelming niceness. It felt a bit illusory and saccharine, but then perhaps my jetlag was kicking in again. </p> <p>The Adelphi Hotel on Flinders Lane is the trendy, shiny haunt of fashion folk, designers and rock stars. A cantilevered swimming pool juts out 10 stories above the pavement below; the pared down interiors feel ever so slightly monastic. Everything, including the stainless steel furniture has been especially designed for the hotel. Teething problems meant heavy metal coffee tables and chairs with lethal edges were given shin pads. One wit described the additions as \"avant guards\". But isn't a place like this is designed to separate the haves from the avants? </p> <p>I met a couple called Robert and Jim in a pub called Vic's. The bar area was a bit like the set for an alcoholic version of Friends, chummy, intimate and slightly unreal. It's certainly none the worse for that. I mentioned my take on Melbourne's niceness and expanded it with my theory that street violence felt remote and unlikely. Jim boasted that the biggest problem was internal Mafia gang violence - there have been 26 deaths in the past few months. The statistic came as a peculiar relief. </p> <p>Caffe e Cucina is a Melbourne institution on Chapel Street famed for attracting the stars as well as for its exuberant waiters. Good food and wine is dispensed with much Italianate theatre and shouting. The Kiwi waiter serving me gave a bravura performance but sheepishly admitted that even though his accent was pretty good, he still had none of the language. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong> Getting there: </strong> </p> <p>Singapore Airlines (08706 088886, <a href=\"http://www.singaporeair.co.uk\">singaporeair.co.uk</a>) flies to Melbourne from \u00a3665 inc tax. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay:</strong> A Studio Suite at The Lyall Hotel (+3 9868 8222, <a href=\"http://www.thelyall.com\">thelyall.com</a>) costs from \u00a3159 per night (room only). </p> <p><strong> Further information: </strong> Tourism Australia on 09068 633235 for a free Travellers' Guide (calls 60p per minute). </p> <p>Flight time London-Melbourne via Singapore: 24hrs. <br>Country code: 0061. <br>Time difference: +9hrs. <br>\u00a31 = 2.45 Australian dollars.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Scotland </strong></p> <p><strong>Ballachulish House</strong><br> </p> <p>Samuel Johnson and James Boswell did it in 1773. Thomas Pennant was there in 1769 and Thomas Gray before him in 1765, but even then it was nothing new to tour Scotland. Lord Breadalbane wrote in 1759: \"It has been the fashion this year to travel into the Highlands.\" </p> <p>It is again - after three years in the down draught of global terrorism. VisitScotland, the country's tourism body, says there's been a 12% increase in international visitors in the first six months of 2004. Cheap flights to Edinburgh, Glasgow Prestwick and Inverness mean Scotland is also becoming a must-go weekend destination from England. </p> <p>As in Johnson's day, visitors want to live like lairds in Scotland's growing number of country house hotels. And although lairds chose locations for strategic rather than scenic reasons, the fact that they were keeping an eye out for attack by sea or mountain pass guaranteed their homes spectacular backdrops. Ballachulish House is no exception. The Argyll coast where Loch Linnhe meets Loch Leven is Stewart country and this 1640 mansion oozes history - the papers ordering the Glencoe massacre were signed under its roof. </p> <p>Today, the eight-bedroom country house is one of Scotland's top award winners for food and hospitality. The generous five-course dinner is good value at \u00a344 per head. It is warm, comfortable and the decor avoids clich\u00e9d \"Scottishness\". Ballachulish House has a Michelin star, reflecting landlady Marie McLaughlin's emphasis on hospitality, which stops short of excruciating over-chumminess if that's not your style. <br><strong>Marian Pallister</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ballachulish, Argyll (01855 811 266 <a href=\"http://www.ballachulishhouse.com\">ballachulishhouse.com</a>).

Yet the county has plenty of enchantments of its own. Carmarthenshire is framed by the Brecon Beacons national park to the east, the Cambrian mountains to the north and miles of sandy beaches along the south coast. </p> <p>Dubbed the garden of Wales, this fertile region is also a centre of the culinary Cymru renaissance (Llanboidy cheese with laver bread is well worth a nibble). So there's lots to do and eat, but where are you going to sleep? </p> <p>Coedllys Country House near St Clears is a renovated farmhouse in 12 acres of open countryside. There are only three guest rooms, which allows proprietors Valerie and Keith Harber to offer a personal, kindly-distant-relatives' touch. When they're not attending to guests or looking after the goats, ponies and donkeys in their mini animal sanctuary, the Harbers run week-long courses on how to manage a successful bed and breakfast business. </p> <p>It's a busy lizzy place with a cottage garden filled with ducks, chickens, flower pots, cartwheels, old ploughs and swinging seats. </p> <p>Inside is a sweet pea combustion of floral print, chintz cushions, rustic touches and Victorian flourish with enough chamber pots and bed warmers to supply a first world war field hospital. </p> <p>The bespoke cooked breakfast - eggs donated by the clutch of hens roaming freely about the place - is accompanied by umpteen types of cereal and jam. The sizeable bedrooms are supplied with fresh fruit, chocolate from the nearby Pembertons Welsh chocolate farm and a choice of tea and coffee to suit all conceivable tastes and there are well-stocked pamper baskets in the bathroom. </p> <p>This is home from home; assuming that your home is stuffed with nice and old sturdy wooden furniture, comfy antique beds and has been pepper-sprayed with nick-nacks, and, of course, that you own a peacock. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Llangynin, nr St Clears, Carmarthenshire (01994 231455, <a href=\"http://www.coedllyscountryhouse.co.uk\">coedllyscountryhouse.co.uk</a>) \u00a332.50pp per night. \u00a315/\u00a321 for a two-/three-course dinner by arrangement. <br><strong>Justine Hankins </strong></p> <p><strong> England </strong></p> <p><strong>Holly Lodge</strong> </p> <p>Robert Greenfield talks like a born-again Christian, referring one minute to his old life, and in the next breath, to his \"new life\". </p> <p>But it wasn't religion that he and his partner Mike Bell embraced four years ago. It was north Norfolk. </p> <p>In their old lives in London, Robert renovated property, while Mike was a hairdresser. But as successful metropolitans are wont to do, they yearned for what in those days they fondly believed would be a simple life in the countryside. And a short break in a guesthouse in Rye, East Sussex, provided the spur. </p> <p>\"We thought maybe we could do that in our own sort of way,\" says Robert. \"Then we saw Holly Lodge advertised in the paper.\" </p> <p>Neither Robert nor Mike knew Norfolk or had any idea what it had to offer. But one trip was all it took. </p> <p>\"No\u00ebl Coward has a lot to answer for,\" says Robert. \"He called Norfolk flat, but people who come here are shocked to see how rolling and undulating it is. With its flint villages and medieval past, it has a wild edge to it and a very French feel.\" </p> <p>It was the medieval connection that inspired Robert when it came to transforming a drab B&amp;B into a guesthouse. </p> <p>Within days of moving in, they had stripped away the turquoise shag-pile carpet and the 70s laminated surfaces to uncover the heart of the 18th-century farmhouse, exposing stone flagged floors and a boarded-up inglenook fireplace as they went. </p> <p>Then they began the style offensive, transforming a terrace of converted stables into a range of three distinct ensuite bedrooms and furnishing the lounge and dining areas of the main house with such riches that guests must wonder if the owners didn't raid the V&amp;A on their last night in London. </p> <p>And outside, beyond the old fruit orchard and the acre of exotic gardens, is north Norfolk. With its vast, mysterious beaches just six miles away, and a hinterland brimming with fine buildings and good food, it's hardly surprising that Robert still speaks with the zeal of the newly converted. <br><strong>David Newnham</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Street, Thursford Green, Norfolk (01328 878465, <a href=\"http://www.hollylodgeguesthouse.co.uk\">hollylodgeguesthouse.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>As far as thank-you gifts go, this is a good one. The Brazilian seaside resort of B\u00fazios honoured its favourite holiday-maker with her very own stretch of seafront. And what a strip of land the Orla Bardot is, running from the centre of town to one of the peninsula's 23 beaches with breathtaking views of the bay. </p> <p>Ever since Brigitte first \"hid\" here with her Brazilian boyfriend in 1964, a litany of world stars, from Mick Jagger to Madonna, have followed her path. But none left quite the impression Bardot did. Her declaration of love for the tiny fishing village catapulted it into the global spotlight and led to its inevitable, albeit tastefully restrained, development as a hub of upmarket tourism. These days it is, rather unsurprisingly, known as Brazil's St Tropez. </p> <p>Not that the locals seem to mind her intervention - with good reason, they positively celebrate it. There's a Bardot cinema. There's even a plaque commemorating the room in which she stayed for the summer. And in the middle of the Bardot seafront sits a bronze statue of the French actress, straw hat in hand, savouring the view as if it were 1964 all over again. </p> <p>Nowadays, the comparisons with St Tropez extend well beyond Bardot's patronage. For B\u00fazios, just three hours' drive from Rio, is the playground of Brazil and Argentina's elite. </p> <p>There is glamour here all right and it's very, very Brazilian. Every torso is tanned to the shade of the wood that gave the country its name and many look like they are no stranger to the scalpel. But it's the de rigueur beachwear that sets Brazilians apart. \"Tiny\" is about the only way to describe it. The girls favour bikinis the size of Dairylea triangles with thongs that could cut their own slice of cheese, while boys see no shame in skimpy white briefs that look like they were bought from Versace Junior. It wouldn't work in Brighton, but in B\u00fazios it all looks right. </p> <p>Night-time in B\u00fazios is when its cobbled and immaculately manicured central area really comes alive. Well-groomed tourists amble down Rua das Pedras, the town's busiest street, casting a critical eye over the boutiques and international restaurants that run its length. But the real focus for these well-heeled perambulists is each other: this is where the evening stroll is turned into an art-form. For those without a jumper to drape over their shoulders, the best thing to do is skip dessert at whatever eaterie you choose, grab a chocolate crepe at the open-air Chez Michou, sit back and watch the action. </p> <p>Night-time in B\u00fazios also means one other thing: caipirinha, the ubiquitous Brazilian cocktail of cane spirit, sugar and lime. A caipirinha may be the closest that alcohol gets to class-A drugs. It has a taste so sweet that one is never enough and a kick as hard as a Roberto Carlos thunderbolt. Four of them and you'll be talking to your flip-flops. </p> <p>But people don't come here primarily for the night-time action; they come for the beaches. And they have a pretty daz zling selection to choose from. Many of B\u00fazios' 23 glorious specimens are within walking distance of the town. Much better fun, however, is to hire an open-top buggy (think of a Mini Moke designed by the Cartoon Network) and decide which stretch of sand suits you best: the coves of Forno or Azedinha for tranquillity, Ossos for posing, Gerib\u00e1 for surf or Olho de Boi for an all-over tan. </p> <p>Deciding on which hotel suits you best is easier: just look in your wallet. For aspiring Bardots and Jaggers, there's an unsurprising wealth of top-end accommodation, among which the Casas Brancas appears to be a perennial favourite. But for those who read OK! rather than appear in it, there's a remarkably wide selection of pousadas scattered along the fringes of town that are as elegant as they are cheap. For around \u00a320 a night, you'll get a large room, a warm welcome and a big breakfast. </p> <p>And that's the one thing that really distances B\u00fazios from its flash cousin on the C\u00f4te d'Azur: its value. This is, after all, Brazil, where the cost of living is cheap, even in its most dazzling resorts. Here, you can eat like royalty for \u00a320 every night, hire a buggy for a tenner and neck killer caipirinhas for 80p a fix. </p> <p>The best thing about B\u00fazios, however, is still free: the view from its seafront. On our last day, we sat ourselves down beside Bardot's statue for one final screening in glorious Technicolor. Tiny white fishing boats pegged the curve of the bay. The sea was the cobalt blue of Brazilian football shorts. Yachts and water-taxis skirted around the Ilha do Caboclo, a tiny fist of green just a few hundred yards out to sea. We looked at Brigitte. She hadn't moved.

  "<p><strong> Bill Driscoll is planning a six-month trip to India. Should he take a water filter or buy bottled water?</strong> </p> <p>Take a water purifier. We use a fairly expensive one, but each cartridge filters up to 100 gallons, and produces microbiologically pure water suitable for drinking and cleaning teeth. There is a distressing amount of plastic waste lying around and buying plastic bottles adds to this problem. <strong> James &amp; Halcyon Leonard</strong> </p> <p>It is a lot easier to buy bottled - it is cheap and easily available, given the amount you will drink in the heat, and, most important, it is likely to be cold. If you are doing some serious trekking up in the mountains, it may be helpful to have a water filter (streams are seldom as pure as they look), but for general travelling around India there is always a shop. Make sure, however, that the seal is intact on the bottle (ask the shopkeeper/ waiter to bring it out unopened). On glass-bottled carbonated water, check that the sealed bottle cap matches the brand on the bottle label - unbranded gold caps are evidence of 'soda stream' style fill ups, potentially from the tap. Check out lime sodas without sugar - fizzy water with fresh lime juice, far more refreshing than filtered water. <br><strong> Toby Egelnick</strong> </p> <p><strong> Peter Jollands wants to go to the Do\u00f1ana national park in Spain in November.</strong> </p> <p>We can recommend the four-star Parador de Mazagon (0034 959 536300, <a href=\"http://www.parador.es\">parador.es</a>), located in the Park, near the beach and a great base for exploring.

Coaches leave from the El Acebuche tourist information point at 8.30am and 3pm, Tue-Sun. Book on 0034 959 430432. Good self-guided walks outside the protected areas are: La Rocina and Charco de la Boca (1 hrs); El Acebron from Palacio del Acebron (45 mins), Laguna del Acebuche from Acebuche (45 mins). Winter is a great time to visit - you should see the pink greater flamingo in the salt marshes. <br><strong> Pat Westwell</strong> </p> <p>A good base is the Cortijo de Los Mimbrales (0034 959 442237) on the eastern edge of the park, 2km south of El Rocio.

  "<p>So you think you can retreat inside now that autumn is here? Well, put on your wellies and get back out there - you're not finished yet. </p> <p>October is a time to reclaim the garden - a time for the mechanics (digging, mulching and pruning) after months of wanton growth. You'll be amazed at what a proper autumnal seeing-to will do for your lawn come next summer. Roses are begging to be taken in hand. And mulching now will protect all your plants from the worst ravages of winter and put back into the soil what summer has taken out. </p> <p>It's not such a bad time to be outside, anyway. While I don't want to come over all mists-and-mellow-fruitfulness, a cool, crisp autumn day, with the vague scent of bonfires in the air and a weak sun warming your back, beats sweltering midsummer hands down. What's more, once all these jobs are done, you will have the glow of smug self-satisfaction to warm you through the cold months ahead. </p> <p><strong>Pruning</strong><br> </p> <p>Spring is the time for careful shaping of roses; pruning now is about damage limitation. Winter winds can rock big plants about, which lets frost get into the roots. Reduce roses by about a third to cut down on wind resistance. Any other shrubs that bear flowers on new growth, such as lavatera, buddleja, caryopteris and perovskia, can also be pruned by a third all over in autumn, especially if they are in windy spots. </p> <p>Fruit tree pruning, on the other hand, is a complicated business, but a general rule with bushy trees such as apples is to open them up as much as possible, to allow air and light into the crown. Start by removing any branches crossing the centre of the plant, as well as any that look damaged or diseased. At the same time, take out spindly branches: they're never likely to amount to much. Next, reduce the length of the long, whippy growths that have been put on over the past year - go down to about the fifth bud. This will encourage the growths to thicken up and make them more likely to bear fruit. Autumn-fruiting raspberries should be cut down to the ground now. </p> <p><strong>Mulching</strong><br> </p> <p>Mulching in autumn protects plants from the worst of winter weather. Frost can harm roots that are near the surface, as well as getting into the crown of perennials and the centre of shrubs and roses. A layer of bark chippings (or composted bark) nestled around them acts as an insulating layer to keep plants snug and cosy. The advantage of bark chippings is that they don't double as plant food (spring is the ideal time to feed plants, to spur them into growth). However, if fertiliser/compost is all you've got to hand, then mulch away with that - it'll still keep them warm. Any plants that are considered slightly tender should have an extra thick layer. Choose a day following rain (this shouldn't be hard): it is important to mulch when the soil is moist, as this seals in moisture. </p> <p>Any areas of bare soil in borders or vegetable beds will benefit from soil improvement now. Use organic matter such as farmyard manure or garden compost. It breaks up thick, clay soils and binds together light, sandy soils, so you can't really go wrong. Spread a layer a few inches thick over the soil and dig in roughly, letting the winter weather do the rest. If you don't want to lug around heavy sacks, try green manures. These are seeds that are sown thickly over the soil simply for the purpose of digging in their young seedlings, so adding bulky organic matter. Field beans and Hungarian grazing rye will both still germinate if sown now. Dig the seedlings into the soil in spring, before they flower. </p> <p><strong>Lawn care</strong><br> </p> <p>Lawns are walked on very little over winter, and will get plenty of rain at the same time: a perfect combination to help them recover. To sort them out, you will need a spring-tined rake, garden fork, stiff brush, sandy topsoil, grass seed and a generous dollop of elbow grease. Get ready to work up a sweat. First, cut the grass. Then take a rake and scratch at the surface. Dead grass, known as thatch, will start to come up. A layer of thatch can prevent water from reaching the roots of your grass plants, so it has to go. You need to be pretty vigorous and scratch in both directions over each patch, but don't worry about getting it all. If you're really keen, you can mow again after. </p> <p>The next stage is aeration. All lawns get compacted simply by being walked on. A lack of air in the soil can lead to soggy patches and mosses. The solution is simple: make some holes. Push a garden fork into the ground at intervals of about a foot over the whole garden. To prevent the holes from closing, sprinkle topsoil, mixed with sand for extra drainage, over the lawn and brush into the holes. The final stage is to reseed any areas that have got too bare - sprinkle these with a bit of extra topsoil, to give them a treat. Once you've done all this, your lawn will look rubbish, but hold your nerve. It will pay off. </p> <p><strong>Manure delivered to your door</strong> </p> <p>Well-rotted farmyard manure can often be found by looking in the classified pages of local news-papers, but here are a few contacts: <a href=\"http://www.dalefootcomposts.co.uk\">Dalefoot Composts</a> delivers composted bracken-and-horse manure, and cow manure nationwide (01931 713281); <a href=\"http://www.crocus.co.uk\">Crocus.co.uk</a> (0870 787 1413) delivers bags of Levington's Farmyard Manure nationwide; <a href=\"http://www.whitebeachfarm.com\">White Beach Farm</a> delivers composted horse manure throughout the UK (01248 490017); <a href=\"http://www.surrey-hills-llamas.co.uk\">Che Guevara's Number Two</a> delivers well-rotted llama poo (yes, this Che is a llama) within a 50-mile radius of Guildford (01483 890555); <a href=\"http://www.amlc.co.uk\">Andrew Montgomerie Landscaping</a> delivers manure within a 30-mile radius of Shoreham, Kent (01959 524375); Green manures are available from <a href=\"http://www.organiccatalogue.com\">The Organic Gardening Catalogue</a> (0845 130 1304).</p>",
  "Employers are to be made to pay the NHS for treating staff injured at work in a move that is expected to save the health service about \u00a3150m a year. <p>Rosie Winterton, the health minister, published draft regulations yesterday giving the NHS power to recoup the cost from insurers.</p> <p>The NHS will charge a standard rate of \u00a3473 for treatment in accident and emergency and \u00a3582 a day if the patient has to be admitted to a hospital ward.</p> <p>Companies are already required to take out liability insurance to provide compensation for staff injured at work. Under the new scheme the insurers will be required to alert the NHS whenever compensation is paid, allowing hospitals to reclaim treatment costs.</p> <p>The cost is likely to be borne by employers through higher premiums. Ministers hope this will create pressure for a safer working environment.</p> <p>For the past five years the NHS has been able to recoup the cost of treating people injured in traffic accidents who have made a successful compensation claim. It reclaims \u00a3105m a year.</p> <p>By charging for workplace accidents, the NHS will increase this income to more than \u00a3250m - equivalent to 53,000 hip operations and 11,000 newly qualified nurses.</p> <p>Ms Winterton said: \"It is unacceptable that taxpayers have to pay for the medical treatment of someone injured at work simply because employers fail to take adequate steps to protect their workforce.</p> <p>\"Individual hospitals will now be able to recover the costs and decide where they want to reinvest that money to improve services they want.\"</p> <p>Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \"It is important that negligent employers pay the full cost of their actions, rather than expecting the taxpayers to subsidise their failures to protect workers.\"</p> <p>\"However, it is also important that this is not just seen as another cost to be added to insurance premiums and instead is used by the insurance industry as an incentive to improve the measures that employers take to prevent injuries at work.\"</p> <p>The union Amicus said: \"Anything that forces bad employers to face up their responsibilities is a step forward. Silly mistakes are costing the NHS and the economy as a whole millions every year\".</p>",
  "<p>Britain is to pay off 10% of the money owed by the world's poorest countries to the World Bank and the African Development Bank in an attempt to free them from \"the shackles of debt\", Gordon Brown will announce tomorrow. </p> <p>The chancellor will tell a fringe meeting on the eve of Labour's annual conference in Brighton that the department of international development will earmark at least \u00a3100m a year to meet the interest payments and principal owed by more than 30 nations. </p> <p>Alarmed that previous initiatives on debt relief have failed to provide a lasting solution to the problem, Mr Brown will challenge other rich countries to follow Britain's lead when he attends the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington next week. </p> <p>The aid agency Oxfam said if the rest of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations followed suit, there would be 6 million fewer child deaths each year, 45 million more children could attend school and clean drinking water could be provided for 140 million people. </p> <p>\"It's a bold and welcome step. If other countries follow suit then this could change the nature of debt as we know it and make a massive difference to global poverty,\" said Phil Bloomer, Oxfam's head of advocacy. </p> <p>Under Mr Brown's proposal, 14 countries that have quali fied for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative and 18 low-income countries that are not part of the scheme - such as Afghanistan, Cambodia and Tonga - would be entitled to financial help from Britain. </p> <p>The countries owe money to multilateral institutions - primarily the IMF, the World Bank or the African Development Bank. Mr Brown says the slice of debt owed to the IMF should be paid off by revaluing the Fund's stock of gold, in an off-market transaction that, he says, would have no impact on the global price of the metal. The IMF's gold is valued at around $50 an ounce, against a market price of just over $400 an ounce. </p> <p>\"Because we cannot bury the hopes of half of humanity in the lifeless vaults of gold, the cancellation of debt owed to the IMF should be paid for by better use of IMF gold,\" Mr Brown will say at the meeting of the Trade Justice Movement tomorrow. </p> <p>The chancellor will say in the absence of an international agreement, Britain will act unilaterally to offer poor countries help with their debts to the two development banks. \"Because the poor cannot wait we intend to lead by example by paying our share of their payments to the World Bank and the African Development Bank.\" The Treasury said the UK's share of this debt amounted to around 7%-8% of the total, but the government was prepared to fund a 10% write-off. </p> <p>Mr Brown will tell campaigners at tomorrow's meeting: \"We do this alone today but we urge you to use your moral authority to urge other countries to follow suit so that poor countries can look forward to a future free from the shackles of debt.\" </p> <p>Hilary Benn, the international development secretary, said last night: \"This is terrific news. We have said for some time we want to go further on debt relief and we got the resources in the comprehensive spending review to do so. </p> <p>\"This throws down a challenge to the rest of the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 has been considering a bid to take control of Radio 1, which would give it a share of the licence fee that currently goes exclusively to the BBC. </p> <p>The broadcaster has been looking at the radical option as part of deliberations over its financial future, which have also included the exploration of a merger with Channel Five. </p> <p>The BBC would vigorously oppose such a move, as Radio 1 is the only service that connects the corporation strongly with a big youth audience. But Channel 4 has said publicly that it is interested in developing a radio business, and Radio 1's young audience would fit well with the television broadcaster's youth profile. </p> <p>A transfer of Radio 1 to Channel 4 could be made under the forthcoming act of parliament that will renew the BBC's royal charter. A green paper will be published early next year. In theory, the government could hand Channel 4 the part of the licence fee spent by the BBC every year to run Radio 1. </p> <p>Andy Duncan, the former BBC marketing director who succeeded Mark Thompson as chief executive of Channel 4, has said he is interested in collaboration with the BBC, particularly in the area of education. Channel 4 is also considering whether to bid for UKTV, the joint venture run by the BBC and cable operator Flextech, which includes channels such as UK Gold and UK History. </p> <p>It has been forced to consider these options because it believes that its television business is not viable in the long term. At the moment it must fund its core channel, which has legal obligations to promote diversity in British television, through advertising. </p> <p>Viewers are gradually moving away from main terrestrial channels towards the hundreds available via digital television. A declining audience share means less advertising revenue. </p> <p>Channel 4 has already launched digital television channels E4 and Film Four to protect its overall audience, but it believes these measures will not be enough. </p> <p>The Radio 1 idea was submitted along with a number of other options to the media regulator, Ofcom, which is compiling a report on the future of public service broadcasting in Britain. The ideas ranged from direct government funding to the merger with Five or complete privatisation as well as a transfer of some BBC assets, such as Radio 1, to Channel 4. </p> <p>If Channel 4 were to run Radio 1, it would not take advertisements, as this would be opposed by the under-pressure commercial radio sector, but it could be free to exploit lucrative sponsorship deals. </p> <p>But senior figures at Channel 4 now doubt whether Radio 1 could be as lucrative as was initially suggested, and it is thought the idea has moved to the back burner. It is likely that any deal to secure Channel 4's financial stability will involve a range of solutions, rather than one big fix such as the transfer of Radio 1. </p> <p>Channel 4 is still pursuing other interests in radio: it recently signed a development deal with UBC Media, the largest independent radio production company in the UK and owner of digital station Classic Gold. </p> <p>It has taken on Richard Park, a former director of programming at Capital radio group and better known to a wider public as the \"headmaster\" in the TV talent show Fame Academy, as a consultant to its radio project. There has been speculation that Channel 4 would be interested in turning UBC's digital books station, Oneword, into a broader speech network aimed at the same youth audience targeted by the television channel. </p> <p>But youth audiences are drawn more to music radio, and there have been doubts about whether a youth talk station would be viable. Digital radio is in its infancy and Channel 4 could not expect to draw significant revenue from the sector for some years. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Channel 4 and UBC each took stakes in Popworld, the music TV show format devised by former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller. Popworld has a cult following on Channel 4's youth orientated T4 weekend programming, and also has a presence on MTV. It is unclear how this would fit with Channel 4's radio strategy. Channel 4 said yesterday that it did not want to make any comment. </p>",
  "<p>Look at any survey listing the favoured career choices of graduates, and business consultancy and working to improve the environment both usually feature fairly high up the list. Now, for the first time, there is a masters course that neatly combines the two subjects. </p> <p>Last week, the first students arrived at Leeds University ready to enroll on its new MA in environmental consultancy. Although literally in its first week - they are still accepting late applications - early indications suggest this is a course with a bright future. </p> <p>According to Louise Ellis, the woman behind the course and a former environmental consultant herself, it is aimed at both recent graduates and those who have been working in the field for a few years. </p> <p>\"We're not only looking for those who have come from an environmental background, we will also accept applications from geographers, engineers, development students - any of the major social sciences. Those who have been working will probably have experience within the regulatory bodies, policy development or some sort of technical field,\" she says. </p> <p>Students have the choice of studying full-time over one year or part-time over two, and the course breaks into three semesters. One of the interesting things about the syllabus is that around half of it is taught by professionals currently working as environmental consultants. Take a quick read down the list of core modules and you won't be disappointed. Social responsibility, business and the environment, stakeholder management in the environmental arena - they all feature. </p> <p>\"This isn't a course that just features taught modules and a dissertation at the end,\" says Louise. \"There are going to be a lot of workshops, projects, and a lot of emphasis on sustainability. I should say it all has a very strong business bias - there won't, at the start at least, be much on the actual science behind environmental projects, although that may be added at a later date.\" </p> <p>The other key factor about the course is that the students will spend the third term on a placement with an environmental consultancy practice, and their research project will be an actual piece of work for that company - either as part of a team or as individual project overseen by another member of the firm's staff. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Louise says she expects most of the students to go on to work as consultants in the field. She says the job market is pretty good at the moment. </p> <p>Home students have to find \u00a35,000 in fees alone, a price that reflects the number of working consultants who will teach. There are still a few places for this year if you can move very fast - overall, there are around 20 places. Applicants should have a 2:1 or first class honours degree in a relevant discipline and, ideally, two to three years' appropriate work experience. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>Job hunting is a daunting prospect. And if you're finding it tough, you're not alone. Recent research shows there are between 300,000 and 400,000 graduates emerging from universities each year - all chasing 70,000 to 80,000 graduate jobs. Colin Gill, a career psychologist from Psychological Solutions, says it's not simply a matter of missing the milkround; there may not be a job available for you. </p> <p>But what's the next step? If you're thinking about taking a year off, the message from recruiters, psychologists and careers advisers alike is to do something valuable during your gap year. Don't just bum around on a Thai beach, for example, says careers adviser Penny Chester from RightCoutts. \"You have to do something that will enhance your skills in some way,\" she says. </p> <p>Generally speaking, graduate recruiters like to see CVs with a gap year or students being involved in activities outside their narrow academic field, says Colin. But they like to see that they are doing something practical. \"There's a big difference between going away for a year on an extended jolly or perhaps spending a year with VSO,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Graduate recruiters are looking for people who have a little bit more about them, more knowledge and experience of the world, but also that rounding, that they will be of practical benefit to the organisation to which the applicants apply,\" he adds. </p> <p>Organisations are becoming more and more discriminating when recruiting, says Colin, so taking a gap year can really help you to stand out. \"The old idea that a degree leads straight into a fairly high-powered job with a clear career path is dead,\" he says. Companies often distinguish first between institutions, then degree subject and degree class, as well as extra-curricular activities. </p> <p>So taking a gap year for the wrong reason can be dangerous, says Penny. \"If you are just doing it because you can't be bothered to get a job, and there's no real end point or outcome from it, then it can be the beginning of drifting, which isn't good,\" she says. </p> <p>\"You have to 'time bound' your drifting period. Say to yourself 'OK, I'm going to have a year out but at the end of that year my intention is to return to do this, this and this',\" she advises. \"It's about discipline and having an action plan,\" she says. </p> <p>If you can talk about something tangible that has come from your gap year - for example, that you've developed your own independence and self-awareness, it can be a very powerful asset at job interviews. </p> <p>Anne-Marie Martin, director of the careers service at the University of London, agrees. She says that there's nothing wrong with going travelling or taking a year out to think about what you want to do - the only question is, what's going to be different in 12 months' time? If the problem is that you're struggling to find direction, going round the world might help - but it will depend on why you're struggling, she says. </p> <p>\"Job hunting is a stressful process and having some time to think about it is a good thing, but running away from it isn't going to make it any easier,\" says Anne-Marie. </p> <p>Here, Rise takes a look at four gap-year projects that combine self-development and travel: </p> <p><strong>Business development in the Gambia</strong> </p> <p>This six-month placement will enable you to help rural communities to gain an alternative source of income and tackle rural-urban drift. By working with local partners, volunteers will share business skills, such as marketing and finance, to give communities hope for the future. </p> <p>The project is looking for volunteers with business skills of all kinds; people with a sense of humour, patience, resilience and a \"desire to get back to the real fun of doing business in a simple environment\". </p> <p>In return you will acquire cultural awareness, inter-personal skills, flexibility and learn to manage in difficult circumstances. It costs \u00a31,200 but this does not include flight insurance, accommodation, food, kit or visas. </p> <p><strong>Teaching English in Ghana</strong> </p> <p>This will give you a perfect introduction to teaching before you embark on the demanding PGCE course. This placement is based in Accra where volunteers will be teaching in private schools for children aged between three and 15 years old. </p> <p>You may have the opportunity to teach other subjects such as French, IT and science, or to take part in after-school sports, drama, art or music. All volunteers will be TEFL trained before they go. Volunteers will not only gain experience in teaching but will build their communication skills and confidence. </p> <p>It costs \u00a31,495 which includes insurance and pick-up from airport but does not include flight, accommodation, food, kit or visas. </p> <p><strong>Working on an English language newspaper in Mongolia</strong> </p> <p>For 12 weeks, budding journalists or anyone wanting to work in the media can gain valuable experience in this competitive industry. You can combine practical journalism skills such as researching, writing and editing stories with the opportunity to dabble in photojournalism. </p> <p>This will look great on your NCTJ application form and show you're serious about working in the media. You will gain practical journalism and media skills and learn about a new culture. </p> <p>It costs \u00a31,495, which includes insurance, accommodation and pick-up from the airport but does not include flight, food, kit or visas. </p> <p><strong>Medical experience and training in Belize</strong> </p> <p>For eight weeks, volunteers will work in a small local clinic assisting doctors with their ongoing medical services for rural communities. In your spare time you can watch the moon rise over the Caribbean, search for monkeys and jaguars, and explore tropical rainforests. </p> <p>You will be committed to helping others and in return you will gain invaluable leadership skills, self-confidence and a \"broader perspective of yourself, life and the world\". </p> <p>It costs \u00a31,795, which includes accommodation, food and pick-up from the airport but does not include flight, insurance, kit or visas. </p> <p>More details of these gap year projects and others can be found at <a href=\"http://www.gapyear.com\">www.gapyear.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" julietshedden@yahoo.co.uk\">juliet.shedden@yahoo.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>In search of a 'broader view'</strong><br> If you are going to take a gap year, you should look for projects that might help you in your career, says Tom Griffiths, founder of GapYear.com. <br>\"If you've come out with a business or accountancy degree, and you want to pursue a career in that field, there may be projects throughout the world that would love to have someone with your skills,\" he says.<br> People who have travelled have life skills, says Tom. \"They've got something about them and something to talk about. I'm not saying everyone should travel - but those who haven't just don't have that broader view,\" he says</p>",
  "<p>Never again will there come a time when the business of buying a recording by Albert Ayler feels, as it felt 40 years ago, like an act of insurrection. His music was born in an era of conflict and danger, when cold war paranoia, the civil rights struggle and Vietnam protests formed crosscurrents that appeared to threaten the stability of postwar American society, generating eddies that were felt across oceans. Yet even now - when the pioneering free-jazz saxophonist has received the posthumous accolade of a lavishly presented box of nine CDs, complete with a book, facsimiles of magazine articles and a pressed flower - to listen to him is to reconnect with a flow that runs against the prevailing tides. </p> <p>\"The music that we're playing now is just the blues of all of America all over again,\" Ayler said in the mid-1960s, in an interview preserved on one of the new CDs, \"but it's a different kind of blues. This is the real blues, the new blues, and the people must listen to this music... This is the only way that's left for musicians to play. All the other ways have been explored.\" </p> <p>From the collective polyphony of early New Orleans jazz to the oblique strategies of bebop, each new style of jazz emerged amid controversy. Free jazz, however, was the first to resist acceptance into the mainstream, probably because it could never be turned into background music. Unlike the classic works of Charlie Parker or Miles Davis, Ayler's music will never be found on a Starbucks sound system. It remains as disruptive and demanding as it was when new. </p> <p>Ayler was a virtuoso who sounded deceptively like a primitive, filtering the grotesque honks and squeals of R&amp;B saxophonists through a completely different sensibility. Whenever people try to describe the sound he made, particularly those who heard him in person, they remark first on its physicality. \"You had to be in the room to feel the full effect,\" said the trombonist Roswell Rudd, who worked with Ayler. \"The first time I heard him was shattering.\" A celebrated American poet likened his saxophone to the blare of a foghorn. Someone else compared its effect to that of a massive snowplough. </p> <p>Like many musicians whose work is noted for the apparent violence of its temperament, Ayler was a gentle, modest soul, devoted to peace and spiritual inquiry. The title of the new box set, Holy Ghost, reflects his desire to freight his music with religious connotations. All these decades later, however, his work has acquired almost nothing of the patina of familiarity that usually softens the work of a revolutionary. The unreleased recordings that nestle at the bottom of the box retain the power to astonish even those long familiar with the movement of which he was a leader. </p> <p>Many of the pioneering figures of free jazz played together and influenced each other, but they were not necessarily up to the same thing. Cecil Taylor, a conservatory-trained pianist, was trying to blend the sophisticated chromaticism of 20th-century western classical music with the rhythmic urgency of the African heritage. Ornette Coleman was developing a form of jazz that kept the stated beat but abandoned the closed structures of Broadway and other song forms, making the free melodies that issued from his alto saxophone into the music's binding agent. John Coltrane, inspired by Indian music, transformed his marathon-length harmonic investigations into a quest for spiritual elevation. </p> <p>Although Ayler remains the least celebrated of the four, he was the most radical in his approach to breaking down the post-Parker protocols of modern jazz. His method was to return to the ingredients from which the very first jazz emerged, to marches and hymns and dance tunes, and to the powerful vocalised effects of the early instrumentalists. Overlaying the music was a spiritual dimension influenced more by the Book of Revelation than by the eastern theologies that were becoming fashionable in the 1960s. </p> <p>He had received instruction in black church music, blues and jazz from his saxophonist father during his childhood in Cleveland, where he was born in 1936. Something of a prodigy, he studied at the local academy of music and played in school orchestras and marching bands, absorbing the classical literature. However, in his holidays he went on tour with Little Walter, the celebrated R&amp;B harmonica player. </p> <p>At 22 he joined the US Army and found himself stationed in France with the 76th Army Band. An informal recording of two pieces by this enthusiastic and accomplished outfit, featuring brief solos by Ayler, is included as a bonus disc in the box. On leaving the service after three years, he concluded that Europe would provide a more fruitful environment than an indifferent America and relocated to Scandinavia. </p> <p>At this stage, he was required to perform the standard jazz repertoire if he wanted anyone to play with him, although his tendency to use familiar tunes as a springboard into the unknown caused consternation among his listeners. The Swedish guitarist Ingemar Bocker, who heard Ayler in Stockholm in 1964, found himself strangely moved but could not help wondering: \"Is this the emperor's new clothes?\" </p> <p>Holy Ghost, however, contains a session that dispels all lingering doubts about his basic competence. During a radio broadcast in Helsinki in 1962, accompanied by a Finnish quartet, Ayler plays wonderful games with the vertical and linear structures of a 12-bar blues by Sonny Rollins, George Gershwin's Summertime and Bronislau Kaper's On Green Dolphin Street. His phrasing may be unconventional and asymmetrical, the strangeness of his playing exaggerated by the use of a pronounced (and highly unfashionable) vibrato, but his choruses are precisely shaped. </p> <p>Several other holes in Ayler's musical history are filled in by these new discs. A 23-minute improvisation with a quartet under Cecil Taylor's leadership, made in Copenhagen in 1962, provides the first recorded documentation of the relationship that brought Ayler to the attention of LeRoi Jones, the poet, playwright and critic (later known as Amiri Baraka), who, in his column in the jazz magazine Down Beat, gave the saxophonist invaluable early publicity. The piece with the Taylor group is described by Ben Young, the compiler of the box, as \"the first recording from anywhere in the jazz spectrum of a long-form improvisation with no overt synchronisation - of time, structural harmony, or song\". As such it was the forerunner of a genre that, within 10 years, would preoccupy large numbers of young jazz musicians around the world. </p> <p> Holy Ghost also features live performances in a Greenwich Village coffee shop by the trio with which Ayler recorded Spiritual Unity, the 1964 album that established his reputation. With this group, completed by the brilliant bassist Gary Peacock (now a member of Keith Jarrett's Standards Trio) and the unorthodox drummer Sunny Murray, Ayler performed a kind of extemporised chamber music of astounding subtlety. </p> <p>The marches and hymn tunes came to the fore a year or so later, when Cherry was replaced by Ayler's brother, Donald, whose technical limitations exerted an influence on the music. Suddenly, the group started to sound less like the next step in jazz and more like some sort of collision between the imminent future and the ancient past. A small group of fundamental themes - one closely resembling La Marseil laise , another based on Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child - were endlessly repeated, with wide variations in timbre and intensity. This group, too, is well represented in the box, notably through its performance at Coltrane's funeral in 1967. </p> <p>Next to the historic piece by the Taylor quartet, however, the music that resonates most powerfully comes from a 1969 concert at New York's Town Hall by a septet under Don Ayler's leadership, with Albert among the supporting cast. In the murk of a recording that barely achieves the standard of a bootleg, identifying individual musicians is virtually impossible. What emerges, however, is an enthralling continuum of blaring, squealing, battering noise, exploding with the anger and frustration of a world in uproar. </p> <p>An aura of otherness always surrounded Ayler's extraordinary music. When his corpse was pulled out of New York's East River in November 1970, the mystery intensified. Admirers concocted numerous theories to account for his premature death, some of them lurid. And while the 200-page hardback in Holy Ghost - beautifully produced and illustrated, with illuminating essays by Baraka and Val Wilmer, and a great deal of new biographical information and first-person reminiscence - fills in the details, the mystery remains. </p> <p>Late in his life, Albert Ayler retreated from worldly turmoil, attempting to devise - with the help of his partner, singer Mary Maria - a more palatable style that would incorporate elements of commercial soul music and psychedelic rock. He failed, and his death in 1970 may have been caused by a combination of dismay at his inability to attract a bigger audience and depression brought on by news of his brother's mental illness. The two CDs of interviews in this package contain strong indications of his vulnerability to public indifference. </p> <p>From his confident early work to his faltering final steps, Ayler was beset by a general misunderstanding of his methods and motives. Holy Ghost sheds new light on a career whose brevity was in inverse proportion to its significance. And what it demonstrates is that, almost 35 years after his death, Albert Ayler is still as far out as far out gets. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Holy Ghost is available from Revenant (price \u00a380) from October 5.</p>",
  "<p>You are at work. The morning coffee break has occasioned a need to visit the loo. As you get back to your desk a red-tinged internal company email message flashes on your computer screen. \"Analysis of your urine deposit at 11.24am shows that you have consumed excessive alcohol in the past 24 hours. This is the fourth time in the past month that urine sampling has registered you at excess of 140mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. This is a formal company notice. You must immediately register for the company alcohol abuse management scheme. Failure to do so will result in the termination of your contract.\"</p> <p>A few seconds later another message pops up on your screen. This time it is from the police.</p> <p>\"Under the mandatory requirement your employers have notified us of your excessive alcohol consumption in the past 24 hours. Your car has been recorded by roadside cameras using the numberplate recognition system as having travelled between your registered home address and your place of work at 8.03-8.31am today. The camera images were checked with the national facial recognition system and it has been confirmed you were the driver.\" </p> <p>It continues: \"You are believed to be in breach of current drink-driving legislation, which permits a maximum of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Your car will be immobilised using the integral satellite-to-vehicle communication system until we have further investigated the matter. Your company will now provide us with blood sample analysis. Please contact your local police station. Do not drive.\"</p> <p>It is a bad morning already, but it is set to get worse. A message from the NHS Genetic Monitoring Authority pops up in your email inbox (snail mail ceased to operate years ago). \"From your recent blood sample we have detected serious flaws in one your genes. You are hereby notified that you are to cease any sexual relations until you have undergone genetic rectification therapy. Failure to comply is an imprisonable offence.\" It sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn't it? But maybe it's not such a leap. Much of this surveillance technology is already in place or under development. And this scenario is just one example of the power of data matching - the sharing of someone's personal data across different computer systems to draw up a complete detailed picture of their lifestyle.</p> <p>A Japanese company has already developed a toilet - targeted for use in large companies - that can analyse whether an employee has recently used illegal recreational drugs such as cocaine or heroin. Numberplate recognition cameras are in place in a number of key British motorways, enabling police to track stolen or suspect vehicles. Facial recognition for CCTV is still in the early stages of development but has already been tried out in the London borough of Newham and other locations. The trials were not wholly successful, but the technology will improve. Leeds University's Institute for Transport Studies has developed a communication box that could be fitted to all vehicles to regulate traffic speed and flow. Immobilisers will be no great problem. </p> <p>As for gene surveillance, experts only need a tiny piece of hair or other cells from our bodies to draw all sorts of conclusions about our genetic inheritance, our parentage, the diseases we are prone to and what is likely to cause our eventual death.</p> <p>All that technology will be at the service of the government, and by 2020 its use will force us to consider the delicate balance between the freedom of the individual and intrusion into our daily lives by the state. </p> <p>The excuse given to justify this technological encroachment into our everyday lives is that our rulers are acting for the \"common good\". Forcibly restricting a heavy drinker's alcohol intake seems like a mundane intervention - and almost a helpful one - compared with the threats from totalitarian regimes of the past. Does punishment for drink-driving really compare with being carted off to the gulags in the days of the Soviet Union? It should do: it is part of the same continuum of state intervention, and it raises the question of where that intervention will end.</p> <p>The apocalyptic school of civil libertarianism holds that the freedom of the individual is already being seriously compromised, and that the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 gave politicians an excuse to introduce ever more repressive laws and technology. \"The 'war on terrorism' has turned into an ongoing 'war on freedom and democracy', which is now setting new norms - where accountability, scrutiny and human rights protections are luxuries to be curtailed or discarded in defence of 'democracy',\" says Tony Bunyan of Statewatch, which monitors civil liberties in the EU.</p> <p>The members of this apocalyptic school believe liberal democracy, which historically has protected us from the tendency of the state to encroach in our lives, is now either dying or already dead. It is being replaced by a creeping authoritarianism. </p> <p>Bunyan says liberal democracy reached its zenith during the last days of the cold war. \"During this period liberal democracy had to have some substance, some tangible reality in opposition to Soviet-style communism. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 it was not just the USSR that disappeared but with it, too, the content of liberal democracy's political culture.\" </p> <p>Simon Davies of Privacy International has an equally bleak take on the state of civil liberties: \"The default has clearly shifted from privacy to surveillance. Almost all large government projects attempt to compromise the right of privacy. The proclaimed need for the protection of children and the fight against terrorism has often been shamelessly used as the pretext for privacy invasion.\"</p> <p>Others, such as Barry Hugill of Liberty, take a less pessimistic view of the state of our freedoms, but even these relative optimists warn that many threats to personal liberty have already manifested themselves. But, Hugill warns: \"People are not aware of much of what is happening.\"</p> <p>Twenty years ago, fears of a Big Brother state were commonplace. Not only were we in the year of Orwell's dystopia, but during the miners' strike the Thatcher government had used the state's ability to make covert interventions in our lives in its fight against the National Union of Mineworkers. The undercover operations of MI5 and the police have disgusted many who bore no sympathy for Arthur Scargill or his fight. Surely we are really in much less danger from the thought police than we were then?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is no, not least because the battleground on which we fight to preserve our liberties and privacy is now so much wider. Civil libertarians are now as concerned about the right to individual privacy as about the issue of political control. \"Privacy is the right on which all other rights rest,\" says Davies. That is why campaigns against developments such as mandatory ID cards and the surveillance culture are couched in the terms of protecting individual privacy.</p> <p>\"What has occurred in the last 15 years is that there has been a systematic attack on the concept of individual rights, especially privacy,\" says Davies. Where has the state extended itself too far into the private sphere? \"It is easier to give examples of where it hasn't gone too far. Nearly every piece of legislation in the past five years has gone too far.\" </p> <p>Why, then, have we not risen up in protest? Perhaps because we trust our government more than we used to. That is the perspective of Conor Gearty, the director of the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the London School of Economics. He believes there has been a profound political shift over the past 20 years. \"Maybe I'm getting old but I think we live in a different world from the days of Mrs Thatcher. The days when my Irish mates would get hauled out of their homes in Kilburn by the police are gone, I hope,\" says Gearty, an Irishman whose view of state power was shaped by the Troubles. \"My impression is that there is not an inevitable spiral towards Big Brother and the repressive state. I think this culture is much more open than people expected. The detention [of terror suspects] is a huge political crisis, but I would be cautious about saying 'Oh, Big Brother is just around the corner.'</p> <p>\"Where I would differ with some of the more republican/socialist libertarians is that I do not believe that advance of technology always fuels the antagonistic state.\"</p> <p>He thinks a new social contract has been drawn up between the government and the public. That is what has allowed the recent legislation to extend the powers of the state, through the police, in dealing with terrorism and crime. \"These laws are passed but the public expects checks and balances to them to be put in place. The issue for me is one of accountability.\" </p> <p>As long as people are sure the state can be held accountable in the event of an abuse of its powers, says Gearty, they are willing to see changes to their liberties as a process to be managed rather than resisted. He cites the recent ruling by the House of Lords that allowed the police to take DNA samples of suspects even if they are not charged. The Lords were willing to allow the police that right, he says, because the safeguards concerning the use of the DNA were sufficient to ensure there was no contravention of human rights legislation.</p> <p>Simon Davies profoundly disagrees with Gearty's analysis. He believes the current government's authoritarian tendencies have been heavily influenced by the philosophy of communitarianism, as espoused by the US sociologist Amitai Etzioni, the author of The Limits of Privacy.</p> <p>The Etzioni model of communitarianism holds that individual rights must be balanced against the concern for the common good. He favours testing infants for HIV, opposes encrypted messages, favours national ID cards, and proposes isolating sex offenders in villages akin to leper colonies. \"If you look at Labour's policy documents and legislation it is riddled with concepts of 'the common good' which take their cue from Etzioni's philosophy,\" says Davies. \"It is this concept of acting in the interest of the majority that has caused the erosion of the idea of individual freedom and privacy. In this dogma all individualism is seen as an expression of selfishness. It allows the government to justify potentially repressive laws.\" </p> <p>But do we not still have privacy in much of our personal life? No, says Davies, we don't. \"You might not want your bank account to be public knowledge, but just look at the tranche of people, from the police to civil servants, who are now entitled to look at your account without your knowledge. That's not privacy.\"</p> <p>Gearty, however, argues there is no immutable right to privacy. \"What's the big deal about privacy? I'm not just for individual autonomy,\" he says. \"It's just out of kilter with the way we live. Part and parcel of society is the invasion of privacy, it is why we live together. It is part of civilised society.\"</p> <p>He suggests the public do not share campaigners' concerns about the multiplication of CCTV cameras - of which we have more per head of population than any other country in the world - and other surveillance devices. The reason is that people see the benefits - helping the police crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour - as outweighing the drawbacks. \"The disjunction between state and the public may be less wide than we may generally think,\" he says. \"Liberal concerns over CCTV and its impact on privacy may not be shared by the public at large.\"</p> <p>It matters that these issues are thrashed out now, because the rights we are currently surrendering to the state are those we will not have in 2020. And governments - the bodies that exercise the powers we grant them - change. So while you may trust Tony Blair, David Blunkett et al to use wisely the powers to interfere in your life that they have accumulated since 1997, how will you feel if a government of a different shade comes in and takes a different view about what constitutes appropriate usage? </p> <p>The possibility of today's anti-crime legislation becoming the planks of tomorrow's repressive state increases with every rise in global tension, because a threatened government is a dangerous government. What happens if Britain's security is in question? What if Islamic fundamentalism develops into an even more potent political force, or if oil shortages lead to global political instability? How, then, would the government of 2020 use the powers it will have at its disposal?</p> <p>\"That's a serious point,\" says Gearty. \"I don't see that happening at the moment, but if we did have a new Thatcher who saw the enemy within and if the police reverted to their ways of the 1980s, that's a real concern. It is not vacuous.\"</p> <p>Some argue the repressive state is already taking root in our society. Tony Bunyan suggests some sections of the community are already bearing the full force of new laws. British Muslims, for example, have felt pressure from both the state and non-Muslim Britons with the launch of large-scale anti-terrorism operations over the past three years. Nor is the fear confined to radical Islam: moderate community leaders in areas where young Muslim men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act fear that Muslims - like the miners and black youths before them - will become tainted as the enemies within.</p> <p>For many, though, the most likely threat to liberty in 2020 will be not political control but overweening nannyism. You are more likely to see your privacy encroached upon \"for your own good\" than because you pose a threat to the peace and democracy. So if you have an obesity problem but cannot resist slipping an eight-pack of burgers and half a dozen doughnuts into your supermarket trolley, expect trouble at the checkout. It is not too far-fetched to believe that the supermarket, under mandatory government requirements, will have programmed your storecard to stop you buying food with a high fat content. You might be prevented from buying more than 10 cigarettes a day or 12 units of alcohol a week. And the government will fall back on a \"common good\" argument to justify this: why should responsible eaters and drinkers have to pay the costs to the NHS of treating indisciplined sybarites who brought their woes on themselves? \"My sense is that by 2020, if current trends continue, the right to privacy for the individual will be an exception,\" says Simon Davies.</p> <p>But in another curious twist, there will be those who will benefit from the extension of surveillance technology. People who at present are, of necessity, dependent on others may find themselves gaining a greater measure of personal independence.</p> <p>Jeremy Myerson, who is professor of design studies at the Royal College of Art, has examined the relationship between design and social and technological change and sees benefits accruing from surveillance. \"By 2020 it is forecast that more than half the European population will be over 50. This is going to have a dramatic effect on the way we care for people, and the burden it puts on the NHS,\" he told the Guardian in July last year. \"Surveillance systems in the home can monitor people and keep them out of institutions. It may seem Big Brotherish, but it's actually about giving people their independence.\"</p> <p>There are no easy answers to the questions raised by the incursions into our liberties. If people are going to accept ever increasing surveillance - in the home, at work, on the street, in the shops - they will need to be convinced it really is for their benefit, not for some sinister purpose. The problem we face in securing the future is that we live in a time of centrist government and economic prosperity, where there are no great issues rending society: exactly the kind of period in which freedoms can be limited without anyone kicking up too much of a fuss. As Gearty, who rejects the view that our liberties are doomed, says: \"We need to keep the culture vigilant about abuse of executive power and to keep parliament mindful to insist on safeguards to new laws.\"</p> <p>We might also recall the observation of another Irishman, the Georgian statesman and judge John Philpot Curran: \"The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime, and the punishment of his guilt.\"</p>",
  "<p>We live, literally, off the fat of the land. We've never had it so good. Life has never been so easy. And it's killing us. We used to die of disease. In 2020 we will die of life - or more specifically, of the way we live. Modern life is storing up trouble for us. Our health is paying for our convenience. </p> <p>Do you want to know how bad it could be? \"Should the gloomier scenarios relating to obesity turn out to be true, the sight of amputees will become much more familiar in the streets of Britain. There will be many more blind people. There will be huge demand for kidney dialysis. The positive trends of recent decades in combating heart disease, partly the consequence of the decline in smoking, will be reversed. Indeed, this will be the first generation where children die before their parents as a consequence of childhood obesity.\"</p> <p>That comes not from the Daily Mail, but from the House of Commons' health select committee, which issued its report on obesity in May.</p> <p>It all seemed to be going so well in the late 20th century. Life expectancy has been steadily increasing. Medicine has conquered diseases such as pneumonia, typhus and cholera, which used to kill young as well as old. But the truth is that many of us will not enjoy healthy, long life. We will be burdened for years by chronic, debilitating illnesses brought on by our lifestyle, which will also be cause our death. Men born in 2001, who will be 19 in 2020, can expect to live to 76, but will be healthy only until 67. Women will live to 81, but healthy life expectancy is 69 years. That gap between the end of good health and the end of life is increasing.</p> <p>How do we live in 2004? We live fast. Our food is fast. Our communications are fast, by phone and internet, allowing us to work fast without leaving our desks. Our supermarkets allow us a one-stop fast shop, which we load into our car and drive home quickly. Most of the effort we make and will continue to make involves pressing keys and pushing buttons, not digging, hewing or heaving as we did just a few decades ago.</p> <p>Today's children are the NHS chronic disease patients of the future because of the way we live: the boy who goes into a burger bar for breakfast before school, the girl who is driven from door to door because her parents are afraid she will be knocked down by a car while crossing the road. They eat crisps at break and a chocolate bar at lunch. She sneaks a cigarette with friends behind the bike shed. They go home after school and play on the computer for two hours or watch cartoons while snacking on biscuits and more crisps. Dinner is a microwave meal.</p> <p>This big-food, little-effort lifestyle is a recipe for obesity, with its attendant risks of heart disease and diabetes. Obesity links directly into diabetes - a chronic condition that takes two forms. Type one can set in young for genetic reasons and require lifelong insulin, while type two can develop later in life, usually because of weight problems. There can be distressing complications, involving blindness, kidney problems and foot amputation. Our lifestyles also put us at risk of stroke and cancers, a risk exacerbated if we smoke, as girls and young women are doing in increasing numbers. Heart disease and strokes are the leading causes of death in the UK today, accounting for 39% of fatalities, followed by cancers at 26% and respiratory disease at 13%, according to the Office for National Statistics. </p> <p>In all regions of the world except Africa, where HIV is wreaking such devastation, these chronic non-communicable diseases are the biggest killers, says Robert Beaglehole, the director of chronic diseases prevention and health promotion at the World Health Organisation. \"The situation in 2020 will remain the same, even if we get serious,\" he predicts. </p> <p>We know what to do to fight the problem, he says, but we're not doing enough of it. \"Obesity is one risk factor for these conditions. The most important and the most preventable one is tobacco smoking. We have known about the deleterious effects for 50 years.\"</p> <p>We have made an effort with tobacco control in the UK and smoking rates are going down. Lung disease and the cancers and heart disease and strokes associated with cigarettes should also decline, but the improvements are much more marked among the best educated, most affluent groups in the country, who find it easiest to quit. \"For a single mother living under terrible conditions on benefit, smoking might be her only succour,\" says Beaglehole.</p> <p>And so with diet. Obesity is more prevalent in poorer parts of the country. Junk food is cheap and filling. \"The availability of fruit and vegetables is socially patterned,\" says Beaglehole. \"If you go to a poorer neighbourhood, the supermarkets will have a different approach to what they are flogging. There might even be some price differentials. Hence the important role of governments in setting the environment. The government has a fundamental obligation to protect the health of its population. You can call it a nanny state if you like. I would say it is setting the conditions which allow individuals to make healthy choices.\"</p> <p>But first recognise your enemy. In 2004, it appears that obesity has crept up on us almost without our noticing. Our lives have been transformed over just a few decades - an extraordinary pace in evolutionary terms - and the consequences have taken until now to be realised. But according to Weight Concern, a charity that is trialling programmes to help overweight families, the perceptions of many of us have also altered so we do not recognise obesity when we see it, because in some parts of the UK it is all-pervasive. Jude Cohen, the charity's executive director, says it has had angry calls from parents or grandparents who have calculated a child's body mass index (BMI - a formula based on height and weight) on the website and refused to believe there is a problem. \"They are really upset. They say, 'According to your website my grandson is obese but he's not - he's just chunky.' It is more likely the child goes to a school where so many children are obese or overweight that they are beginning to think that what their child looks like is normal.\"</p> <p>Jane Wardle, a professor of psychology who works in the Cancer Research UK health behaviour unit at University College London, and who also works with Weight Concern, thinks the prognosis for 2020 is bleak. \"Nothing yet suggests this inexorable rise is going to plateau, because we're running a few years behind the US,\" she says. The situation across the Atlantic is even worse. Will obesity-related diseases increase in the UK as well? \"I'd say that will happen and they will be coming on progressively earlier in people's lives.\"</p> <p>We can try to modify our culture, she says. \"There's quite a strong political will to do this, motivated by the potential health costs, but not a very strong public will at the moment except in relation to children.\" </p> <p>The problem is that the changes we would have to make would unpick the advances of the convenience society. Do we want to have to walk further than the fridge, take hours instead of minutes preparing food, eat less and cut out the high-fat tastes we have come to like? \"I think it is going to be quite difficult to make changes in the world because the things that have caused obesity are more convenient homes and workplaces. We have designed physical activity out of modern life and it is difficult to design routine physical activity back in. We have designed convenience into our food supply,\" she said. </p> <p>The alternative, she suggests, is to help people to take deliberate physical exercise and limit themselves in the face of food temptation, so they say: \"I'd like this but I won't have it; I'd like more but I won't have it; I'd like it now but I'll have it this evening.\"</p> <p>But that route depends on a cultural shift. She notes the numbers of young girls in cropped tops, showing off rolls of fat around their middles in a way that used to be unusual. She wonders whether a concern about anorexia has gone too far the other way. Parents, and she includes herself, she says, have become worried about suggesting to their daughters any other relationship to food than a free-for-all. \"A spectre has hung over us and while we weren't looking, the world changed,\" she says. </p> <p>Professor Sir Charles George, the medical director of the British Heart Foundation, is not so pessimistic as the MPs of the health select committee. Although overeating and lack of exercise will push heart disease rates up, he thinks we can stave off the worst of the problems with medical interventions, such as widespread use of the class of drugs called statins, even if we face an uphill struggle convincing people to change their lifestyles. \"We will have more and more people over the age of 65 and a still greater proportion over the age of 75. But we're going to see postponement of coronary heart disease events by quite a long period. There's going to be a still further decline in death rates in the under-65s and some deferment of those aged 65-74 into a later age,\" he says. Prevention is key, though, he says, whether by better diet and more exercise or through preventive drug treatment. </p> <p>Other chronic diseases that will become more prevalent for the foreseeable future are harder to prevent. Asthma, for instance, has a whole panoply of possible underlying causes and triggers. But it is undoubtedly a disease of our times and our lifestyle: it is possibly associated with diet, possibly with modern hygiene and possibly with the quality of the air we breathe. Nothing looks likely to derail the upward trend in the incidence of asthma.</p> <p>Cancers, too, are linked to our lifestyle in complex ways that are not fully understood. The numbers of cancer cases will continue to rise, although the mortality rates will probably also continue to fall with ever better treatment, as has been the pattern for some years now. Breast cancer is linked to the decline in breast-feeding, as we have fewer children, later in life, and hurry to wean them, but diet may also play a part, as it does in many cancers. Some chemicals in general use are known carcinogens.</p> <p>We can do something to improve our environment and our lifestyle, but we can't do anything about the genes we inherit, and these can play a big part in our health expectancy. However, by 2020 we may choose to stop ourselves passing them on. Fertility clinics can already test and select embryos, created in the laboratory, that carry certain genes, such as the gene for early-onset Alzheimer's disease and for some cancers. These could be replaced in the womb with disease-free embryos. Only a few of the \"problem\" genes can be identified as yet, but within 16 years we may well all have the option to choose our future child's health and \"breed out\" certain genetically determined conditions.</p> <p>But even genetically perfect babies, free of all the disease genes we can identify, can become couch potatoes doomed to a life of medication and chronic disease clinics. We will undoubtedly have a longer life expectancy in 2020, but how good a life may depend on how much we are willing to scrutinise our lifestyle and reform it in the years to come. It may be that life will have to become just that little bit less easy if we are to enjoy it to the full. </p> <p>Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health editor</p>",
  "<p>Midnight in Dublin on the north side of the river Liffey. Busty Lycra, a drag queen at the Guru club, and her friend Miss Misdemeanour huddle together for warmth as they shift from foot to foot and inhale deeply on their cigarettes. Their elaborate wigs and the white tassels of Miss Misdemeanour's red cowboy jacket flap in the chill wind.</p> <p>Later on stage, Busty asks clubbers for their opinion. \"What do you think of the smoking ban?\" As she turns her microphone in the direction of the audience, there is a loud roar - broadly of approval, but tinged with the occasional boo. \"What do you think? Yes? No? Fuck off?\". She laughs. </p> <p>As the evening wears on, more people head outside for cigarette breaks. They are laughing and joking as they collectively light up and attempt to shield themselves from the cool September air.</p> <p>\"I think it is a lot better, I like the clean air,\" says Laura Eustace, 35, as she takes a drag of her cigarette. \"I must admit when I first heard about it, I was absolutely horrified. But I have never spoken to so many people as I now have outside bars - it has a very sociable aspect to it.\"</p> <p>She says it is nice to go home \"and find that your hair and clothes don't stink of smoke the following day\". </p> <p>Six months after smoking was banned in workplaces (which includes bars and restaurants) Laura reckons there are still places \"out in the country\" where it is being defied. \"There are places in Kerry where people are smoking in pubs,\" she says. \"They just whip out the ashtrays when you get a lock-in. It is not as strict as Dublin. I have not found anywhere round here where you can have a cigarette.\"</p> <p>The Dubliners aired their views of the ban as a group of politicians and health officials from Greater Manchester visited this week on a fact-finding mission; they are hoping to make workplaces in the conurbation - population almost 3 million-smoke-free. If they are successful it will be the first place in England to enforce such a ban. On Thursday the health secretary, John Reid, indicated that the government would take action to tackle smoking in public places as he met campaigners from anti- and pro-smoking groups. He is expected to publish his long-awaited public health white paper next month. </p> <p>\"I have listened to all sides of this debate very carefully,\" he said. \"The balance of both evidence and opinion on this issue is such that the status quo cannot continue.\"</p> <p>In Dublin, the absence of smoke in pubs is startling. Instead of a thick, fuggy swirl hanging in the air, it smells different - the aroma of hearty nursery food and stale beer instead of tobacco. The brightly painted pubs and restaurants around Temple Bar are still busy with people drinking pints of Guinness. </p> <p>\"I have felt much healthier since the ban,\" says a woman who has worked behind a bar for four years. \"I used to get a lot of colds and problems with breathing after I had been at work. Now I don't have to wash my clothes and hair when I get home just to get rid of the smell of smoke.\" </p> <p>The Greater Manchester delegation met the Irish health minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. He said around 7,000 people had given up smoking since the ban on March 29 - and the government would see the bene fits in reduced healthcare costs. The majority of hospital admissions, he said, were due to smoking-related illnesses. </p> <p>\"The world has not collapsed since the smoking ban,\" he said. \"Irish people continue to drink and go out. People now enjoy eating and drinking in a smoke-free atmosphere. When we visited New York, to find out about the smoking ban for ourselves, I asked if they had any regrets. They said the only regret was they wished they had done it sooner.\" </p> <p>He acknowledged there had been a reduction in tax revenue from tobacco, as fewer people are smoking, but said it would not make a significant difference as they would spend their money on other commodities. </p> <p>This month the drinks company Diageo said the ban had affected sales of Guinness in Ireland - which had fallen by 6%. Its chief executive, Paul Walsh, blamed lifestyle and demographic changes, price competition \"and the initial impact of the smoking ban\". </p> <p>Gallaher, the maker of Benson &amp; Hedges and Mayfair cigarettes, noted that cigarette sales in Ireland in the first five months of the year had fallen by 9%. </p> <p><strong>Sales fall </strong><br> </p> <p>What has been surprising has been how Ireland has wholeheartedly embraced the ban - the Office for Tobacco Control, which enforces it, reports there has been 96% compliance. </p> <p>There has, however, been a minor rebellion. The owners of Fibber Magees in Galway flouted the ban until they were threatened with legal action. Their protest was dismissed as something of a publicity stunt, rather than a serious uprising. </p> <p>Councillor Pat Karney, the head of Smoke Free Greater Manchester, described the delegation's visit as the most important 24 hours in the history of the campaign. </p> <p>\"In Greater Manchester, all workplaces will be going smoke-free as soon as possible,\" he vowed. \"Do not say it can't be done.\" </p> <p>He said the campaign was not about going after smokers, but about creating a healthy, smoke-free environment in the workplace. </p> <p>\"In Greater Manchester we are ahead of nearly every other region in the country - such as Birmingham and Newcastle - and we will move really quickly once the route map is outlined by health secretary John Reid.\" </p> <p>Another delegate, Lord Smith, the leader of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, said there was no reason Greater Manchester should be any different to Ireland, where the ban has been self-policing. \"Landlords don't want to break the law and nor do members of the public,\" he said. </p> <p>In Ireland, any contravention of the ban can result in a fine of \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,000.) </p> <p>Danny Byrne, the owner of the Eliza Blues restaurant overlooking the Liffey, is broadly supportive of the ban. But he says if he were a bar owner he would have preferred segregated smoking areas and improved ventilation. \"It was too much to go for a total ban,\" he says. </p> <p>Not everyone is enamoured of the ban. In the Bagel Bar, smokers Julie O'Connor and Carol Conway say they never go to pubs any more. \"We don't mind a ban in a little coffee shop like this,\" Julie says. \"But we don't really go to pubs any more after work. </p> <p>\"Instead, we will go around to friends' houses to have a drink and a smoke. I am surprised that people have taken the smoking ban so well.\" </p> <p>Carol adds: \"My family lives in Northern Ireland and I was back up there at the weekend. I was smoking in the pub more than ever - just because I knew I could. </p> <p>\"Now when you walk into pubs the smell is disgusting. All you can smell are the toilets, the dirt and the musty upholstery.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was when he hit 40 and his children started school in north London that Michael first remembers being impressed by the teachers. It was at a time when the Teacher Training Association was doing its \"you'll always remember a good teacher\" recruitment campaign. </p> <p>Michael recalls having an \"internal voice\" that kept speaking to him. \"And one day it said 'I want to be a teacher' and it was no longer a joke. I can't explain it rationally,\" he admits. \"But I like children and I was engaging more and more with how my own children were learning. </p> <p>\"I suppose it was something to do with positive input, too. Something about getting them young before they reach the criminal courts. I liked the idea of working with children in a less cynical environment than in the legal profession, where the truth sometimes gets obfuscated. </p> <p>\"I was lied to by all kinds of people in the profession, almost on a daily basis. Lying is a bit strong, but it was a case of playing fast and loose with things. I'd go home at the end of the day and then try to explain things to my children and inculcate values about not lying.\" </p> <p>Which is when he listened to his heart and decided to change direction. </p> <p>\"It happened one morning when I woke up. I was doing well as a lawyer and it was a bright sunny day. It was as if my eyes had been opened. I was following my heart.\" </p> <p>Michael recognises similarities between his former and current work spaces. </p> <p>\"In the legal profession you meet a variety of people: clients, lawyers, judges and police. In teaching you meet parents, children and teachers. In both, it's about knowing your audience: you have to be sensitive to a tribunal. You have a sense of that with the children in your classroom.\" </p> <p>Used to standing up in court, he was also unfazed by standing at the whiteboard, the computerised screens that replace blackboards. \"I've got no problem with public speaking or dealing with parents and other adults. When I did my teacher training in Camden I was immersed and inspired.\" </p> <p>He moved south into Sussex to follow his wife's career and now teaches in the Maidenbower Junior School in Crawley. </p> <p>\"It's a new school on a new development and it's very well resourced. There are 550 children and there's a very supportive team.\" </p> <p>He feels at home in the classroom. \"Classrooms are very individual and mine isn't the tidiest. Inkwells are long gone; it's now whiteboards and pens and dust on computers. </p> <p>\"I don't wear a suit any more but I suppose you could say my dress is smart casual. We don't have school dinners - it's all packed lunches - but in the staff room biscuits and cakes are brought in and there's always masses of tea. </p> <p>'That's why I wanted to be a teacher - to find out what goes on in the staff room.\" </p> <p>He says that teaching Year Five has helped him to rediscover the joy of imagining things. \"You have that as a child but you lose it a bit as an adult. Teaching helps you to get back in touch with your imagination.\" Teaching can also be as stressful as law but in a totally different way. He gets up early, leaves school late, then works at home. </p> <p>\"It's hard work but I am as deeply fulfilled as I have ever been. As a lawyer I was running on empty. </p> <p>\"When I got my first pay slip as a teacher I felt proud. It was a blue slip of paper and I remember thinking 'I really earned that and I deserve this money'.\" </p> <p>When asked if he has any regrets about making the change and taking a massive pay cut, his answer is immediate. \"Not for one nanosecond - 40 is an interesting age because you can still change. </p> <p>\"At 50 it would have been harder. At 40 you think about what would really make you happy and I think you need to rediscover perhaps what you were looking for as a kid. As for the money, we are generally more affluent now. How many more needs can we have?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Teacher Training Agency: <a href=\"http://www.tta.gov.uk\">www.tta.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "Is it possible to combine a free-enterprise economy with the serious pursuit of equality? This is the question that Labour strategists might find hard to avoid as they gather in Brighton searching for a third-term \"big idea\". The traditional Labour answer was always no. The real gulf, it argued, was not between rich and poor, but between \"workers by hand and brain\" and the owners of the means of production. There could be no meaningful progress towards equality while the commanding heights of the economy remained in private hands. <p>New Labour did away with all that. Clause 4 was dropped, while Tony Blair declared it was never a burning ambition \"to make sure that David Beckham earns less money\". But it did not do away with questions about equality. And as the latest report from the Institute for Public Policy Research reveals, in the past two decades the richest 1% has seen its share of total income double from 6.5% to 13%. Finding progressive answers to the stark iniquities of a market economy is surely what a third term should be about. And some powerful solutions can be found in the Labour party's pre-history. </p> <p>In its earlier years, New Labour could avoid talking about strategies for reducing inequality. With the collapse of communism, it was widely agreed that Clause 4 could no longer be defended. Socialised economies had, it seemed, only exchanged one form of inequality for another, at the cost of mounting inefficiency and stagnation. In the 1997 election it was sufficient that Labour possessed a strong leadership and had accepted Mrs Thatcher's destruction of the politics of collectivism and class. The most important thing about Blair's party was that it was not \"old Labour\". In 2001 as well, little was said. A prosperous economy, sound financial management and Tory disarray were enough to secure a landslide victory. </p> <p>This time, Labour may have to be more specific. The problem is not middle England, which has shown little sign of reverting to the Tories, but Labour's other constituencies. Spin, disquiet over Iraq, disgust with Blair's proximity to Bush, panic about asylum seekers, hostility towards Europe and anxiety about public services could lead to support drifting away. Party membership has fallen; activists are demoralised; protest votes have grown; and erstwhile supporters are opting for everything from the Scottish Socialists to Ukip. More ominously, there is a growing number of non-voters. </p> <p>A commitment to the principle of equality is precisely what is needed to re-enthuse Labour's more questioning supporters. New Labour can already claim some achievements. Doggedly, if covertly, it has reduced child poverty, supported controls over the global environment and increased aid. Poorer families have also benefited from the reduction of unemployment, the increase in nursery places, and the minimum wage. But Labour has never been able to take much credit for this laudable record because it refuses to make a connection between the elimination of poverty and a more equal society. </p> <p>Most obviously, Labour is terrified of the E-word because it fears the reaction to higher taxation for the rich. This would be understandable if it were simply a tactical concern. But it seems more basic. For the evidence suggests New Labour agrees with the new right critique that greater equality could only be at the expense of a free-enterprise economy, and that its pursuit would consequently lead back to an ever more entrenched public sector. In short, a return to Old Labour. Therefore, giving up \"socialism\" means abandoning the goal of greater equality as well. </p> <p>This is a fallacy. It is based upon a foreshortening of history, in which the intellectual origins of neo-conservative laissez-faire are dated back to Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, of 1776. Omitted from the story is the fact that Smith's original reputation was that of a progressive whose work provided the foundation of the radical critique of aristocratic monopoly and of the bellicose state that protected it. </p> <p>It also forgets that the first thinkers and activists to build on Smith's work were libertarians of the left. They included people such as the English radical Tom Paine and the French revolutionary Condorcet, both of whom believed growing inequality was not the inevitable price of a free-enterprise economy, but could be remedied by science and \"the social art\". They were the first to propose universal pensions and schooling, death duties and tax-based systems of social insurance as remedies for poverty and ignorance. For them, two obstacles confronted social advance: \"force\" (aristocratic or oligarchic rule and the laws that protected it); and \"fraud\" (unreasoning superstition and prejudice born of ignorance). Unshackled from this legacy of injustice and oppression, capitalism went together in their minds with scientific progress, increasing equality, free trade, feminism, anti-slavery, anti-colonialism and anti-racism. </p> <p>This was not the founding moment of neo-conservatism. That came a few years later at the end of the 18th century with the frightened reaction to the French revolution. In England, loyalists burned Paine's effigy. In France, Condorcet died in prison. In this climate, anti-revolutionaries such as Edmund Burke and Thomas Malthus denied the radical implications of Smith's work, ridiculed Paine and Condorcet and set in motion the long-term association between liberal economics and conservative politics. </p> <p>But an accurate account of this period shows that the pursuit of equality can be conceived in terms quite other than those of socialism. The language of Paine and Condorcet was that of the coming together of commercial society and the modern democratic republic elaborated in the era of American and French revolutions. Greater equality with a minimal state, universal education, moderate redistributive taxation and social security belonged together in a language of reason and citizenship. As little reliance as possible was to be placed upon the state, since it was associated with a legacy of tyranny and corruption. </p> <p>Instead, the inequality and uncertainty constantly generated by a modern exchange economy was to be curtailed by a democratic constitution in which a framework of law was maintained by a combination of voluntary associations and local authorities - in modern terms, mutual associations, friendly societies, cooperatives, elected local boards, ethically oriented companies and trade unions. </p> <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, this new language of citizenship and democratic enlightenment was increasingly pushed aside by opposing extremes: on the one side, laissez-faire individualism and a language of markets; on the other side, socialism and the language of worker and capitalist. </p> <p>In the 21st century, Labour's \"big idea\" might be to start again from the true birthplace of social democracy, the Enlightenment of the 1790s, with its ambition to combine the benefits of individual freedom and commercial society with an ideal of inclusive citizenship and the public good. The needs of the market can be combined with policies fostering greater equality. New Labour needs to rediscover the first way. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gareth Stedman Jones is professor of political science at Cambridge University and director of the centre for history and economics, King's College.

  "As the Labour party gathers in Brighton, we propose an alternative future to the one apparently envisaged by Tony Blair and Alan Milburn for our next election manifesto. If a new tax net band at 50% were introduced for those earning in excess of \u00a3100,000, it would raise an additional \u00a34.8bn; and if the UK's annual contribution to Nato was reduced to be the same as the average percentage (ie 0.7%) of monies spent on defence by the western European Nato nations, this would save another \u00a37.3bn. <p>Some of the alternative ways of investing this windfall are: \u00a33bn a year could end all fuel poverty; \u00a31.9bn would allow us to double the winter fuel allowance for pensioners; \u00a32bn would pay for six medium-sized district general hospitals and their operational costs; \u00a3600m would cover costs for linking basic state pensions to earnings increases; \u00a31.35bn year would pay for all tuition fees for higher education; \u00a3450m would allow all prescription charges to be scrapped; \u00a32bn could lift some 200,000 children out of poverty; \u00a3800m invested in wave energy power generation would be a significant contribution to our climate change and emission reduction strategy. <br><b>Llew Smith MP</b><br><b>Diane Abbott MP</b><br><b>Harry Barnes MP</b><br><b>Harold Best MP</b><br><b>Martin Caton MP</b><br><b>Jeremy Corbyn MP</b><br><b>Ann Cryer MP</b><br><b>John Cryer MP</b><br><b>Neil Gerrard MP</b><br><b>Kelvin Hopkins MP</b><br><b>Terry Lewis MP</b><br><b>Alice Mahon MP</b><br><b>Bob Marshall-Andrews MP</b><br><b>John McDonnell MP</b><br><b>Alan Simpson MP</b><br><b>David Taylor MP</b><br><b>Bob Wareing MP</b><br><b>Mike Wood MP</b> </p> <p>What a shame you chose to quote only women who were negative about the government (What women want, G2, September 24).

  "<b>Dear Peter</b> <br> As a lawyer you must be aware of the steady erosion of civil liberties we are witnessing in an increasingly authoritarian Britain. Now the Home Office is considering banning BNP members from the civil service. Surely encouraging public bodies to sack or veto people for their political views can only be yet another nail in the coffin of freedom. The fact that progressives can even contemplate such a move shows just how cavalier we have become about free speech and freedom of political belief. <p>You might say that a ban would only apply to members of an abhorrent party such as the BNP, but on principle we should be robust in arguing for the right of every citizen, every worker, to espouse the political views of his or her choice. Employment discrimination against members of any political party is McCarthyism by any other name dressed in the radical clothes of anti-racism. Giving the green light to any home secretary to ask would-be civil servants, \"Are you or have you ever been ... ?\" will affect all of us. </p> <p>And would you really trust David Blunkett, the most illiberal home secretary of the modern era, with even more power to police people's politics? Isn't that the same David Blunkett whose punitive treatment of asylum seekers and new immigrants can only make the cranks in the BNP full of envy? <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> There is a line to be drawn between the right to freedom of expression as balanced against the need for members of all communities not to experience racism and differential treatment in their everyday lives.</p> <p>The BNP, despite its recent attempts at adopting a cloak of democratic respectability, is an openly racist party that advocates policies that dictate people's rights depending on the colour of their skin. There is an expectation that with the exercise of power comes responsibility, particularly when one considers the exercise of public duties that often impinge on the rights of others.</p> <p>It is not unreasonable to propose that it is unacceptable for the promoters of certain political views to hold public office. I cannot, as a member of this society, expect my son to be taught by a racist or a sexist, or expect my freedom to demonstrate to be curtailed by such people purporting to be police officers or magistrates. </p> <p>I understand that the German constitution prevents Nazis from holding public office. The question should be whether the UK should have a lesser test. History provides some hard lessons of where democracy surrenders too many freedoms in the name of liberty. The BNP should be exposed for what they truly are, and the principle of balancing the rights of all citizens should not be dependent on the views of a rightwing and populist home secretary. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> Your talk of \"drawing and line\" and \"balancing ... rights\" actually means curtailing rights. Rights are not divisible; you cannot have the \"right to free speech unless your speech offends someone\". To qualify rights with conditions makes them gifts of the state, handed out and withdrawn arbitrarily. This is a matter of principle. However much you object to the BNP, that objection must not become the vehicle through which democratic gains are eroded for us all. </p> <p>You ask me to learn the lessons of history. You might remember the House Committee on Un-American Activities grew from a committee established in 1938 aimed at Nazi activity in the US. It became a permanent committee in 1945, and while little came from its investigations of Nazis it came into its own when it dealt with those who supposedly had communist sympathies.</p> <p>Public office-holders should be held to account for their capacity to do their jobs. If their political prejudices mean they actually abuse their power, then of course they should be disciplined. It would be as unacceptable for a housing officer with Christian views to deny housing to an atheist as for a BNP member to discriminate against an Asian. But neither should be denied a job simply because they hold particular views. </p> <p>The example of teaching is pertinent. I used to teach in further education. To many, my views were \"offensive\", especially my espousal of an open-door policy and an end to all immigration controls. As a trade union office-holder, I also led several strikes. None the less I was able to teach English and history as required and my students got good results. Those members of management who suggested my \"certain political views\" were incompatible with my teaching role were wrong, and it is a good thing they did not have the sanction to get rid of me. <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> I am afraid you fail to understand that the European court does not agree with your views as the right to freedom of speech is always balanced with my right not to be offended by what a racist or fascist might say.</p> <p>To suggest that BNP members can legitimately be police officers, judges or teachers appears to miss the point: BNP members' views are so fundamentally opposed to the democratic norms of society that they cannot perform the roles of police officers, judges or teachers without the strong suspicion that they will be inherently biased against the black and minority communities. On a rational basis, what confidence can we expect black and minority Britons to have in democratic institutions if they are supposed to expect equal treatment from card-carrying BNP civil servants?</p> <p>I recently had the pleasure of playing Paul Robeson at the Tricycle theatre in the play entitled Are You Now or Have You Ever Been a Communist? The ideological hysteria against communism is not to be confused with the attempt to restrict the BNP from holding public office. As Robeson said before the Congressional hearings: \"I am not being tried for whether I am a communist; I am being tried for fighting for the rights of my people, who are still second-class citizens in this United States of America.\"</p> <p>The ability of journalists such as Taki, writing in the Spectator, to express race hatred and anti-semitism has to be linked to the thug who then commits the racial murder on the street. Anyone who believes that holders of public office should be card-carrying members of the BNP should spend some time with a victim of race hate crime. Should we carry adverts inviting BNP members into the police force? I think not. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> I am sure you don't seriously expect me to take my lead in political principles from the unelected European court. Free speech is a political right that has to be defended by all of us, not a mere clause in some document dreamed up by bureacrats.</p> <p>I consider the fight for equality and against racism to be an important political focus but I think we are in danger of talking up the significance of the BNP in this context. The rise in votes for the BNP is accompanied by the rise in support for anyone who represents \"none of the above\", from a candidate dressed as a monkey to support for a ragtag of independent candidates. </p> <p>As many commentators have noted, many of those who vote BNP do so not because they are hardcore racists but rather as a way of giving two fingers to mainstream parties. This obsession with Nick Griffin and his nasty little coterie is actually helping transform them into the talking point of British politics. Ironically, it is policy proposals such as this employment ban that help build the BNP into a national political force.</p> <p>I am also worried by the ease with which you conflate speech with action. You move seamlessly from racist rants to racial murder. The distinction between the expression of certain views and the committing of specific acts is a crucial one, a bulwark against the insidious notion of thought crimes. </p> <p>Every section of society, of whatever ethnic origin, has far more to fear from a state that is able to criminalise views it considers unacceptable and treat them on a par with violent actions than any individual Pc Plod in the BNP. <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> You forget to recognise that the European convention is not some bureaucratic nicety interpreted by a few remote figures in Strasbourg. The convention, like the Geneva convention on refugees, has been endorsed by democratic governments and indeed was created from the desire not to have Europe descend into government-led dictatorships of the far right or left. On the one hand, you decry governments as being oppressive, but then denounce the articles of the European convention, which has the task of restraining governments and upholding the rights of individuals.</p> <p>Maybe my ability to link racist rhetoric and the physical attack derives from experiencing the aftermath of verbal abuse. The men, women and children who experience the aftermath of a BNP march and who are prevented from venturing out do not have the luxury of an academic debate with racist members of the BNP or their supporters. As a child growing up in the north-east, there was not a great deal of opportunity for someone who calls you a nigger to engage in the freedom of speech semantics in some cosy debate. </p> <p>Would you take your complaint of racial harassment, sexual assault or homophobia to a BNP police officer or magistrate? I doubt it </p> <p>The suggestion that by leaving the BNP to fester it will simply go away is, I believe, normally called appeasement. Pay a visit to the Holocaust museum in Washington, dwell for a moment in the slavery museum in Liverpool, or walk in the killing fields of Rwanda. Listen and look to the children of all races who are left to wonder what a world we have created. We owe a duty not to engulf them with the same complacency, indifference and laissez-faire attitude that is the hallmark of the oppression of one group by another.</p> <p>At the London Race Hate Forum we are aware of the clear link between the presence and activity of the BNP and the rise in racial violence and tension. An international prosecutors' conference in Stockholm two years ago found a well-organised and international fascist network, of which the BNP was clearly part. Ideas, funding, policies and strategies have been coordinated in Europe and North America for some time. The BNP are not the isolated thugs they may appear to be, and the sinister ability to move to the mainstream, as in Holland or in eastern Germany, should not be brushed aside.</p> <p>As a person likely to be on the receiving end of racism, I would rather see the BNP excluded from public office than wake up one day to say: \"I told you so.\" History rarely awards communities a second chance. At the end of the day you cannot enjoy your freedom at someone else's expense. <br><b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>Dear Peter</b><br> I am not interested in defending the employment rights of BNP members per se any more than I am interested in the free speech of racists to racially abuse others. But once the principles of political freedom and free speech are compromised for those we despise, they are compromised for everyone. </p> <p>I agree about the importance of equal treatment under the law, and that is why I am not complacent about attempts to give legal endorsement to unequal treatment in the workplace. Have you noticed how convenient the BNP bogeyman has become for mainstream politicians who want to claim the moral high ground of anti-racism? </p> <p>No matter how reactionary Howard or Blair are on quotas, holding camps, or discussions about swamping, they never tire of issuing warnings against the extremists in the BNP. This is little more than a phoney moral crusade allowing those who really wield power and make discrimination a reality to dress themselves in the cloak of anti-racist virtue. Finally, do I trust government - local, national, or European - with even more power to finger people as a potential threat to democracy? Let's give the last word to Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens). <br><b>Yours, Claire</b></p> <p><b>Dear Claire</b><br> The freedom to work is an important human right, but you place undue reliance on those holding public office declaring their personal and political bias. It would be naive to suppose individuals within the BNP would not wish to infiltrate public bodies.</p> <p>The issue of Yusuf Islam has little to do with employment rights and is an example of the clear difference between the Islamophobic approach of the US government and the legitimate protests made on his behalf by the Muslim community and the British government.</p> <p>Racial bias is by its very nature often an insidious threat, and in order to produce an inclusive society we need all citizens to have confidence in our democratic institutions. <br> <b>Yours, Peter</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Claire Fox is director of the Institute of Ideas.

  "<p>One-day international cricket was given its birth on a January afternoon in Melbourne 33 years ago. There have been 2,180 more games since that one-off, with umpteen competitions. </p> <p>Eight World Cups have come and gone, the first in England in 1975, when the game had yet to gain sophistication, and the last in South Africa in 2003, when Australia again set the benchmark for the modern game with techniques, tactics and strategies. Two decades previously a reverse sweep was a quirk that the Pakistani Mushtaq Mohammed tried occasionally in a county match, and a slower ball was simply, well, something that was not quite as quick as a quicker one. </p> <p>Five countries have won the World Cup: West Indies the first and that of 1979, both in England; India in 1983, against the head and also in England; Australia are three times winners - 1987 on the subcontinent, 1999 in England again and 2003; Pakistan took the title in Australia in 1991-2, and Sri Lanka, back on the subcontinent, in 1995. </p> <p>In addition there have been four ICC Champions Trophy tournaments which began, as the England coach Duncan Fletcher has said, as a tin-pot fund-raising tournament in Dhaka, but biennially has developed into an event which in limited-overs terms is second in prestige only to the World Cup. Of these, South Africa took the first, New Zealand the second and the third. What it means is that of the 10 Test-playing countries, all have won a major global competition except Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and England. </p> <p>Now comes the very real chance to put that right. At The Oval today, England will come up against a young West Indies side that, away from the rigours of the Tests, gave them a bit of a one-day runaround in the Caribbean and again over here earlier in the summer. England's status as an Aunt Sally in the short form of the game was totally at odds with the progress made in Test cricket over the past few years. </p> <p>But something odd has been happening to England. First of all India, a mighty side when on song, were beaten in a three-match series, the only loss suffered by Michael Vaughan's men coming in the third, dead match. Next, after Zimbabwe were ritually disposed of at the start of this current tournament, Sri Lanka were well beaten by Andrew Flintoff's remarkable century, and then, in the sort of complete display of which coaches, captains and players dream, Australia were not just defeated but overwhelmed at Edgbaston last Tuesday. After that, any match will seem a cakewalk. </p> <p>Of course, beating Australia has brought with it the expected baggage. England, lest we forget, will again challenge for the Ashes next summer, and, as ever, any glint of gold in the hard rock is welcome. But the hyperbole, ignoring the fact that a lot must happen to both sides before next summer, has been relentless. Bring on the Ashes. So an early sense of perspective is required. Vaughan's side played out of their collective socks on Tuesday and the product of the team, just as it had been for Europe in the Ryder Cup in Detroit a few days earlier, was greater than the sum of its parts. Australia, on the other hand, were off the game and off the pace. </p> <p>In part this was due to the pressure placed on them by England's harrying, first with the ball (Matthew Hayden did not try coming too far down the pitch to Steve Harmison before retreating to the relative safety of his crease) and then with the bat. For all the runs that have been struck by England's batsmen these past 12 months, few can have had the impact of Marcus Trescothick taking four impudent, disdainful boundaries from one Glenn McGrath over and the England captain bringing Brett Lee to his knees with a withering assault. Australia are finding Shane Warne irreplaceable. </p> <p>The significance of the treatment of McGrath cannot be underestimated. Here is one of the great bowlers who carries with him a mystique, part from glorious deed and part self-promoted, which of late has camouflaged the cracks in his game. He is ageing, only recently out of rehabilitation from serious injury and significantly off-colour. </p> <p>This was a case of the Emperor's New Clothes, as if Trescothick suddenly realised that the machine at the other end was bowling badly and, more than that, in a predictable spot. He could disappear. McGrath's spell, leastways that which he has held over England batsmen, has surely been broken and he will never carry the same authority again. </p> <p>Perhaps we should not be surprised at the sudden surge in success for England's one-day side. Gradually, under Nasser Hussain and now Vaughan, the yoke of defeatism has been traded in for a winning habit. They like the taste and it permeates from one form of the game to another. Some, like Andrew Strauss, scarcely know anything else, a player who marks his Test debut with a century, his one-day debut with his side's top score, and his first match against the world champions with an unbeaten half-century at the sort of pace Andrew Flintoff would envy. </p> <p>There is a remarkable team spirit in England's ranks and massive self-belief. Gradually a process of elimination since the last World Cup has weeded out the wasters and there is a nucleus of good, solid players. This year's Academy intake, focusing on the one-day game, should even in the short term see the development of a greater pool of talent. </p> <p>But we need to be careful in expecting too much too soon. Tuesday represented a landmark day for England, the end of a losing streak against opposition that went back to the last millennium. Vaughan and his team were brilliant, the win enhanced by the fact that for once it was not achieved on the back of Flintoff's derring-do. Learning to win without him is almost as important as simply learning to win. </p> <p>It was a single win against Australia, though, and in one-day cricket, on any day given a fair wind, even the mangiest underdog can bare its teeth. England have won single matches against more accomplished Australian sides than this. In 1997, just before the Ashes of that summer, they actually won all three of the Texaco Trophy matches: that is how much of a pointer such games are towards Tests. </p> <p>So while there should be celebration if England win today, as they ought, with the prospect of extending that into a long sequence of success over the winter, no one should get too triumphalist. Winning matches needs to be translated into winning series and winning competitions on a regular basis. </p> <p>There is a danger, though, that because of the amount of one-day cricket England play, which is significantly less than anyone other than Bangladesh, they can only play catch-up to a place from which the rest of the world has already moved. So while there is experience now in the side's nucleus - Trescothick, Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Paul Collingwood, Darren Gough and Vaughan, while Steve Harmison is the world's leading fast bowler - there are precious few matches against credible opposition before the next World Cup. Scant time then for James Anderson, Simon Jones, Kabir Ali, Sajid Mahmood, and Alex Wharf to learn the wiles that it took Gough, say, years to accumulate. </p> <p>England might well have their best side since the World Cup final of 1992, the last time they reached a major final, but there is a long and hard road yet to be trodden before they are indisputably the finest. </p> <p><strong>What other nations think of England</strong></p> <p><strong> Mahale Jayawardene</strong> (Sri Lanka) </p> <p> I knew Michael Vaughan when he came to Sri Lanka as captain of England's Under-19s and we all knew then that he was a class act. It was just that England didn't really believe in themselves. </p> <p>The recent form owes most to Steve Harmison. He is the one who gives them the most confidence of all. Teams can gain inspiration from the presence of a great strike bowler and Harmison is at the top of his game. </p> <p>For excitement, you look no further than Freddie Flintoff. He is playing brilliantly. When I dropped him at slip at the Rose Bowl, I knew we might be in for trouble. He used to be a strong man liable to play rash shots. Now he has adjusted his game and only takes risks when necessary. He is so destructive. </p> <p> <strong> Shaun Pollock</strong> (South Africa) </p> <p> In the past England have had to rely on a few different bowlers, but Steve Harmison has been fantastic. He's bowled sides out, and he's given England the belief that they can bowl sides out. </p> <p>Andrew Flintoff has also had a big impact. It's great to have an all-rounder in that sort of form with bat and ball. That's given them depth in the batting as well as the bowling departments. </p> <p>Their young guys like Geraint Jones and Andrew Strauss have come in and performed, but the experienced players like Marcus Trescothick, Graham Thorpe and Michael Vaughan have played really well. The confidence all of that creates is very valuable to a team. </p> <p>England are in serious form and they must be confident about coming to South Africa. </p> <p> <strong> Ray Price</strong> (Zimbabwe) </p> <p> In the past county cricket wasn't that strong, but with the introduction of two overseas players per county there are players fighting to get in and that has made English cricket a lot harder. The wickets are also getting better - teams are scoring 600 and still losing. Guys like Flintoff, Harmison, Strauss and Ashley Giles are playing very well, and all at the same time. </p> <p>Harmison is the best seamer in the world at the moment, Giles is up there with Daniel Vettori and Flintoff is going nine to the dozen. The whole team's body language is fantastic. They're not intimidated by anyone, and they don't seem to be worried about pressure. Importantly, the players have learnt their roles within the team. It all adds up and makes them a very good side.</p>"
