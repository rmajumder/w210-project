  "<b> For </b> <br> Diran Adebayo, award-winning author and commentator <p>I welcome flyposting. It is part of a world of media that operates underneath the proper mainstream stuff. It is a public information service. It gives me information I want to know and it does it very effectively. </p> <p>You can walk down Green Lanes in North London and there are flyposters about some Greek Cypriot singer or an African singer who is in town that you otherwise would never have known about. It is how those communities keep in touch with what is happening and allows the rest of us to to keep in touch with those sub-cultures. </p> <p>I am dead against the council, because it seems we are developing a very straight conformist culture. I am libertarian minded and I think there is too much nannying from the left. There is a very illiberal tendency. </p> <p>Surely these are part of the \"can do\" entrepreneurial spirit that we are supposed to welcome. One of the things I have always like about London in particular is that it is not a highly designed city. There are different energies living cheek by jowl. There is an improvised feel to London and flyposting fits in with that. Flyposting just makes an area more funky. </p> <p>Camden has done very well from having a slightly bohemian reputation. If they want to sanitize the area, maybe they should clear away some of the dirt and the litter. </p> <p> <b> Against </b><br> Maxwell Hutchinson, architect and commentator </p> <p>Flyposting is an insult and an unnecessary intrusion into the environment. Most of the posters have no value or virtue in themselves and are badly stuck on the walls, but still like honey to a tea towel. </p> <p>They are plastered one on top of another, which makes them utterly incomprehensible, so the whole point is lost. It also costs thousands of man-hours to remove them. </p> <p>If only they were funny or witty or engaging, one might forgive them. I don't see them as aggressive, but they are ugly and I have never learned anything from them that was worth learning. </p> <p>If these companies are so intent on publicising their wares, local councils should give them special noticeboards so they can do it properly. </p> <p>They could at least be an entertainment, designed well, competing with each other and no one else, in a legitimate space.</p>",
  "<p>Every perfumier's nightmare has become reality in Halifax, Nova Scotia. By instituting a policy of \"no scents makes good sense\", discouraging the wearing of cosmetic fragrances in municipal offices, libraries, hospitals, classrooms, courts and buses, the Canadian city has given official recognition to the suffering of hundreds of \"fragrance-sensitive\" citizens. </p> <p>And it's not the only one. Santa Cruz, in California, has banned fragrances from public meetings. In neighbouring Marin County, patrons of the area's restaurants can now choose to eat their meals in a fragrance-free section. </p> <p>What's the problem, you may ask. Well, the products with which we clean ourselves and our homes are artificially enhanced to smell of spring meadows or exotic fruit, or at least a chemical approximation of them. Even the air conditioning in offices can be chemically treated so that it smells of anything but circulated stale air. But banishing unpleasant odours from everything but our most intimate moments has come at a price. Our love of fragrance could be making us sick. </p> <p>Clinical research and anecdotal evidence suggest that our overuse of artificial fragrances makes them a major suspect in Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS) syndrome, a catch-all term to describe a range of allergies and maladies thought to be caused by the increasing concentration of man-made chemicals in the atmosphere. And they suggest that what many of us dismiss as symptoms of everyday life - headaches, sluggishness, streaming eyes, itching skin - could be symptoms of fragrance-sensitivity, as chemicals are absorbed through the skin or inhaled. </p> <p>MCS has also been linked with asthma, depression and hypertension. According to Betty Page, head of the Fragranced Products Information Network, the situation is becoming intolerable for the most seriously afflicted: \"Those who wish to limit their exposure to fragrances are finding it difficult at best, and impossible in most circumstances.\" </p> <p>Like cigarette smoke, the effects of fragrance chemicals are not restricted to the wearer. Campaigns against \"second-hand scent\" and \"passive smelling\"could become commonplace. Some experts believe that efforts to ban fragrance wearers from public spaces could be as bitter and divisive as current battles to ban users of tobacco. </p> <p>Growing concerns about artificial fragrances opens up the possibility that, in the not too distant future, the health conscious will shun friends who continue to deodorise, criticise their dinner host's air-freshener habits and avoid the perfume halls of department stores. </p> <p>In the meantime, says Anja Leetz of the European Environmental Bureau, there are a few steps we can take to limit exposure. \"We advise reducing the use of air fresheners, for example, and opening a window instead. There is also no need, except in a medical environment, to use antibacterial soap and cleaning agent. </p> <p>\"But in the end we need more data about the properties of these chemicals. The industry assures us they are safe, but other research contradicts that.\"</p>",
  "The days of illegal flyposters bringing news of music, plays and political demonstrations to the streets of Britain could be numbered after a court yesterday issued anti-social behaviour orders against three of the industry's executives. <p>In the first case of its kind, three staff of the \"ambient\" marketing company Diabolical Liberties were made the subject of interim orders following an application by Camden council in north London. An application for an order against a fourth employee was turned down. </p> <p>It means that the three, including the managing director, Tim Horrox, risk jail if they are found in future to have involved themselves in flyposting in that borough. </p> <p>While local authorities argue that flyposting is corporate vandalism and an urban blight, human rights groups argue that it is a vibrant and historic part of freedom of expression. Many artists and entrepreneurs fear banning the posters could damage counterculture, music and politics. </p> <p>Theatres and other entertainers have flyposted for centuries. But Highbury Corner magistrates, in north London, heard that Camden considered the practice of flyposting to be detrimental and a cause of harassment in the borough. </p> <p>District judge James Henderson was shown letters from local residents testifying to the discomfort the posters had caused them. The council claims it spends \u00a3250,000 each year cleaning up illegal flyposting, and has appointed a \"boulevard manager\" to remove the posters and track down the culprits. </p> <p>It has successfully used the threat of Asbos to make the music giants Sony and BMG stop flyposting in the borough. </p> <p>Before the case, there were warnings that stopping what is sometimes the only affordable publicity for small arts organisations and alternative groups could sound the death knell for independent theatres, alternative viewpoints and street culture. </p> <p>Roland Muldoon, the artistic director of the Hackney Empire, has said that his venue would not exist without flyposting. \"This decision being pushed forward in Camden is terrible for theatre and arts venues because more councils will follow. Small venues will lose the lifeblood of affordable publicity.\" </p> <p>Liberty, the civil rights group, has also voiced fears that using Asbos to tackle flyposting could affect political diversity and freedom of expression. </p> <p>Malcolm McLaren, former manager of the Sex Pistols, has spoken out against banning the posters on aesthetic grounds. </p> <p>Diabolical Liberties has turned an illegal counterculture into a lucrative business, employing 100 people and having a turnover of \u00a310m. </p> <p>Lawyers for Mr Horrox, James Heighway, Dominic Murphy and the fourth employee, Anna McAfee, argued that the interim order should not be issued because they said the council failed to follow the correct procedures. </p> <p>They claimed that the council had failed to consult and to liaise with the police as required by law. </p> <p>The judge refused an application against Ms McAfee, but said Camden had presented a prima facie case and was therefore entitled to the interim order against the others. </p> <p>\"There is evidence that flyposting causes harassment and distress for those within the area and that this does amount to anti-social behaviour,\" he said. </p> <p>He also upheld the council's right to hold the four defendants responsible. \"There is evidence that the four before the court to a greater or lesser extent have directed anti-social behaviour.\" </p> <p>A full civil hearing will occur in the next few months. Immediately after the ruling, company representatives said they would appeal. </p> <p>Afterwards John Thane, Camden's executive member for the environment, said: \"This is anti-social behaviour and we don't just chase the men in the little white vans. Flyposting has nothing to do with culture. It has everything to do with money.\" </p> <p>Adrienne Merrill, communications director for Diabolical Liberties, said the Asbos would have a serious effect. \"There are more live venues in Camden than almost anywhere else in the country. It is a terrible shame that Camden don't see cultural ads as relevant to the borough.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dale Vince seems very much at home eating brown rice and lentils in his local Stroud wholefood cafe. Wearing a patterned Indian cotton shirt, blue jeans and sandals, his conversation covers organic farming, alternative energy and Michael Moore. </p> <p>Predictable, perhaps, for a Norfolk-born boy who spent 10 years as a new age traveller living in the back of old trucks and buses. But more surprising for a man who is now managing director of a power and distribution utility - especially one who has just picked up an OBE from Buckingham Palace.</p> <p> Vince is one of the new generation of green entrepreneurs who have moved from fringes to mainstream in doublequick time. His Ecotricity company claims to be the biggest independent wind business, albeit still a minnow compared with the likes of Scottish and Southern Energy or United Utilities. </p> <p>But Ecotricity punches above its weight because Vince has a seat on the government's renewables advisory board and has been involved in some very high profile energy schemes. He has just won a new contract to build six turbines for the Co-operative Financial Services to power a quarter of its premises and has provided power for Ford's large Dagenham site in east London. </p> <p>Soft-spoken and vegan he may be, but this new-style utility boss is considered a tough negotiator and is far from a passive participant in a booming, but still cutthroat, sector. </p> <p><strong>Goodwill</strong></p> <p>Vince believes the green energy business is in danger of losing the goodwill of customers because of the way some of the large utilities have been acting. \"There is a big scam going on here with big and small power companies jumping on the bandwagon. They are often charging customers a premium for renewable energy from plants built years ago,\" he says.</p> <p>The difference with Ecotricity is that it promises to use the bulk of the income it gets from new customers to build turbines - and then give them all their energy from that renewable capacity. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, Ecotricity does not even want to provide new customers with 100% green energy from the start - although it can offer that. Instead it asks people to wait. Cutting CO2 emissions and saving the planet from global warming will only come about if new capacity is built, argues the company. </p> <p>Ecotricity is spending \u00a37m this year - half its turnover - on new turbines. In 2005, it will double its capacity again but admits if it won a million customers tomorrow it would not be able to cope. </p> <p>Although Ecotricity likes to be seen as the greenest of green, it still faces some of the same irritating obstacles as those encountered by larger rivals - like planning delays. Vince is pretty angry about that. \"You can't be in wind without having problems with planning. On-shore schemes are in the hands of local councillors, who don't read the details of applications, don't understand government policies and cave in to local pressure groups,\" he argues. </p> <p>Ecotricity wants the government to hand over control to county councils so that projects are pushed ahead faster. </p> <p>Once again he blames the big power companies for some of the objections to wind power by choosing inappropriate locations and building on a massive scale. \"We only deal in small projects of two to three turbines and ensure the local community are comfortable with the scheme. This is very different from those trying to build huge wind farms in sensitive areas.</p> <p>\" So what does he make of Tony Blair's speech this week when he championed the cause of renewables by warning in the strongest terms about climate change? </p> <p>\"It was a great thing to hear such a positive statement but I worry that he mentioned solar, wave and offshore wind power, none of which are here [producing] now. The one thing he did not talk about was onshore wind, which even the Department of Trade and Industry accepts is the one that will deliver government targets. If he is afraid to speak about it because it might upset folk in the country - rather like fox-hunting - then that's not a good sign.\" </p> <p>Vince says he is proud of his growing company. Ecotricity employs just 40 staff but it has developed a growing network of 5,000 customers and supplies electricity to the Body Shop and Sainsbury's. As well as operating seven wind parks and developing an eighth for the new Co-op deal, Ecotricity also builds renewable energy equipment and claims to be Britain's biggest exporter of wind masts. </p> <p>He is particularly pleased to be trusted by big name clients like Ford. But is there not something ironic about a devotee of renewables helping one of the world's biggest producers of climate-destroying cars bring even more into the world? Not at all, he says. \"It's better that we provide power than some traditional source, and, anyway, Bill Ford [the new chairman] is a strong believer in the need to fight global warming. He is doing a lot when it comes to producing a new generation of more planet-friendly vehicles.\" </p> <p>However, Vince is not willing to help everyone who comes to see him. \"I was asked to work for McDonald's - green them up - but drew the line at that point, given I am a vegan and have got very strong views about food,\" he says. </p> <p>The Ecotricity man has clearly mellowed in other ways since he left school at 15 with nine O-levels but no desire to pursue any normal route to jobs and money. \"I did not want the career and mortgage I felt were being forced down my throat by the system... I quit towns and houses to live in a series of buses, trucks and benders in Britain and Europe.\" </p> <p><strong>Burgeoning</strong></p> <p>He spent some of this life as a peace campaigner, occupying the Molesworth air base in Cambridgeshire, and at one Glastonbury festival he rigged up a windpower telephone for fellow revellers. </p> <p>He claims to have gone from one man band to burgeoning electricity supplier on the back of \u00a31,000 worth of savings. His big break was to build his own wind monitoring tower and then find Scottish Power wanted \"a shedload\". Recently he has funded turbine expansion with the help of Dutch-based ethical bank Triodos. </p> <p>In 1995, he launched the Renewable Energy Company - since renamed Ecotricity - and by 2000, he had won a Queen's Award for Enterprise. It took endless determination and big battles with planners, grid companies and even the National Trust, he says. </p> <p>Paul Monaghan, the Co-op executive who agreed the deal with Ecotricity said nobody should underestimate him: \"He's not a hippy when it comes to a deal. He's as hard-nosed as any businessman.\" </p> <p>Still, Vince appears to be mildy self-conscious about his move from bender to the smart barn where he now lives and is anxious to emphasise he still lives without the \"electronic heroin\" of television. </p> <p>The secret of his success, he says, is a commitment to self-reliance, another principle from the early days. \"From the start, everything I needed I had to build myself - but it enabled me to live with so little money. Most of us spend an awful lot of time working, in order to pay other people to do things for us. I reversed that trend. I built trucks, lived in scrapyards, got paid in parts, learned how to weld.\" </p> <p>He went on to teach himself everything from book-keeping to general business practice. In the early days, he dressed in collar and tie, fearing that he would be excluded from traditional sources of financing and regulatory approval if he was seen as \"an old hippy\". Now he is more relaxed, or perhaps engaging in clever marketing. </p> <p>So what did the boss of Ecotricity wear to meet the Queen? \"A black collarless shirt and jacket. I thought it might be disrespectful to turn up in my normal gear.\" </p> <p>\"I messed up anyway. We were told only to speak if spoken to and address her as 'ma'am'. I just blurted out 'hiya, I'm Dale'.\" </p> <p> <strong>The CV </strong></p> <p><strong>Born </strong>Great Yarmouth, August 29 1961 <br><strong>Education </strong>Oriel Grammar, Great Yarmouth <br><strong>Work </strong>Claims to have never had a \"proper job\" unless you count New Age Traveller and Peace Campaigner in that category <br>Set up: Western Wind Power in 1991 Next Generation, 1995 The Renewable Energy Company, 1996 (Changed name to) Ecotricity, 1998 <br><strong>Interests </strong>Science fiction, motorbikes and nutrition <br><strong>Family </strong>New fiancee Kate.

  "The French agriculture ministry has infuriated animal welfare organisations by defending that bastion of Gallic culinary culture, foie gras, rather than bow to the demands of Brussels. <p>The ministry yesterday gave the country's 6,000 producers an extra five years - until 2010 - to scrap the cramped individual cages, known as \u00e9pinettes, to which geese and ducks are confined at the end of the fattening process, arguing that a European ruling on the subject was just a recommendation, not a directive. </p> <p>\"It's shameful,\" said a spokeswoman for the French Animal Rights League. </p> <p>\"France has ratified all these conventions on cruelty to animals, and even put most of them into national law, yet it continues to condone this barbaric practice. It seems foie gras is sacred.\" </p> <p>The battle over France's most emblematic delicacy has been raging since 1998, when the Council of Europe, under pressure from countries like the UK, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, where ethics tend to outweigh considerations of mere gastronomy, issued a directive stating that no animal should be \"provided with food or liquid in a manner ... which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury\". </p> <p>The council and many other European bodies, up to and including the commission, have since made many more rulings and recommendations, all of which - if they were ever observed - would end the force-feeding of ducks and geese for foie gras. </p> <p>One states that animals should be fed \"a wholesome diet appropriate to their species, in sufficient quantity to maintain them in good health.\" Another says that ducks and geese, if kept in cages, should be able to \"stand normally, turn without difficulty, flap their wings, preen, perform social interactions and feed and drink normally\". They can do none of these at present. </p> <p>But foie gras is big business in France, which accounts for 70% of the 20,000-odd tonnes produced in the world each year and for 85% of global consumption. The industry, centred in the south-west, employs 30,000 people directly and indirectly, and the average French person eats foie gras at least 10 times a year. </p> <p>To make the nation's favourite entr\u00e9e, farmers push a 25cm (10in) tube down the neck of each bird and pour in 450g (1lb) of corn two or three times a day for up to a month. By the time they are slaughtered, they are suffering from acute liver disease (the organ swells from five to 10 times its normal size), diarrhoea, panting, walking difficulties, lesions and inflammations </p> <p>The foie gras lobby has, of course, fought back fiercely. Recently a committee of eminent scientists from the National Veterinary School and the State Agricultural Research Institute produced an 80-page report claiming the birds cannot be being cruelly treated because they are neither ill, over-stressed or even over-fed. </p> <p>One team found that once force-feeding is stopped, the birds' livers return to normal within a month and their organs shows no lasting damage. A second denied the birds' diet was excessive, citing cases of farmyard geese capable of voluntarily eating up to 600g of corn at a single sitting, while a third measured their stress levels and found they were far more frightened by any passing stranger than by the farmer who came to feed them. </p> <p>But pressure is mounting inexorably on France if not to halt the production of foie gras outright - which even the most committed animal rights activist recognises is not very likely soon - then at least to improve the conditions in which the birds are housed and fed. </p> <p>\"We will implement the recommendation on individual cages, but we need more time and we're glad the government has recognised that,\" said Marie-Pierre P\u00e9 of the industry association Cifog. \"Bigger cages will make it harder to grab the birds. </p> <p>\"Feeding them will take 20-30% longer. That will cost us money.\" The agriculture ministry declined all comment on its decision.</p>",
  "<p>By any standards Deadwood is extraordinary. The lives of the characters, a hellish collection of claims jumpers, chancers, real-estate swindlers, gamblers, road agents, opium addicts, saloon girls and sex slaves culled from the local orphanage, are nasty, brutish and short. Everyone in Deadwood is there either to make money or to have money made from them. Taken together, the subject, characters and photography seem to recall an animated canvas by Pieter Bruegel or Hieronymus Bosch. Deadwood is hideously beautiful. </p> <p>American cable network HBO, which commissioned the series, has generated its fair share of controversy in the past. Sex And The City, The Sopranos and Six Feet Under have all managed to challenge, disturb and even outrage with their language and content. However, with Deadwood, a 13-episode western set in the titular South Dakota town at the height of the gold rush, HBO have surpassed themselves. Written by David Milch, the man responsible for Hill Street Blues and the seminal NYPD Blue, Deadwood is shocking even to those of us who have long regarded the mythology of the wild west as mendaciously self-serving and fanciful. </p> <p>The series (now in its second American season) takes one of America's most cherished genres and doesn't so much play with its conventions as turn them inside out. The western is one of those mediums that few have the courage to mess with. Even the revisionist works of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah and Clint Eastwood ultimately fail to challenge the apple-pie notion of the cowboy as anything other than a rugged individual out to tame America's badlands with a six-shooter and a Bible. </p> <p>There is no shortage of rugged individuals in Deadwood. In fact you might say that rugged individualism is the series' overriding theme. The sun-beaten faces are rugged, the beards and flea-bitten moustaches are rugged and the language is rugged enough to make even the most piratical of sailors blush. Neither does the series lack in biblical exhortations to do good. The difference here is that the Bible is simply another tool used to murder the native population (\"Godless fucking heathens\") and that individualism amounts to nothing more than stomach-churning rapacity. </p> <p>Speaking from his Californian home, Milch, a former professor of English at Yale University, sees no such contradiction. \"I had originally proposed this as a series about Rome at the time of Nero,\" he explains. \"I had this idea about the urban cohorts, which were essentially Rome's city cops. Except that there was no law, nothing really to administer. So you had order without law. I wanted to look at how a society might function under those terms. However, HBO are already working on a series set in ancient Rome so I was asked to think of a different venue to engage with the same themes and I decided to settle upon the western. Rather like Rome, you had a series of historical accidents that created a community that consciously rejected the idea of law, but had its own terrible version of order. So in a certain sense there is a continuity from my previous work, because it seems to me that cops are the instrument of order for whom law is at best an inconvenience.\" </p> <p>Milch chose the setting of Deadwood because nowhere in the US quite so perfectly embodied the anarchy of America's westward expansion. Set in 1876 just weeks after the battle of Little Big Horn in the Dakota territory initially ceded to the Sioux, the denizens of Deadwood use the discovery of gold and the death of General Custer as a terrific excuse for Lebensraum. Ethnically cleansed of its native population, lawless Deadwood counts on squatters' rights. As Milch puts it: \"Deadwood is an accelerated version of the subjugation and settlement of a whole continent.\" </p> <p>At the centre of all this blood and mud are two characters on a deadly collision course. Al Swearengen, played by Ian McShane, is a monster of primitive accumulation, who owns one saloon and brothel as well as most of Main Street. Down the muddy block, wanting to start a hardware store, is the newly arrived Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), a handsome but hot-tempered ex-lawman. In the traditional western it would be the marshal turned pioneer whom we would root for and the brothel keeper who would come to a bloody but righteous end. This being written by David Milch, all such notions are quickly forgotten. There is something overbearingly pious, not to say hypocritical, about Bullock's endless Christian hectoring. His first act of \"humanity\", for instance, is to yank the body of a hanging man by the feet to hasten his death. Even the lynch mob look shocked. Al Swearengen, on the other hand, who has a lust for life and a fantastically profane line in insults, has a charm and humour you warm to despite yourself. He is, as one internet fansite puts it, \"the most corrupt, dishonest, vulgar and lovable son of a bitch to ever grace the small screen\". Or, to put it another way, imagine Tony Soprano running a whorehouse in the wild west. </p> <p>\"I kind of wanted people to like, or at least understand, everyone in Deadwood,\" explains Milch. \"Deadwood lacks any kind of social contracts. Without that social contract, freedom is just licence. Essentially, it's fascism, and there is a terrible romance to that. I think that is what is so alluring about characters like Swearengen: he is a strong, charismatic figure, who will permit himself almost anything. He is also a sentimentalist: he will always buy his whores from the orphanage where he was raised.\" </p> <p>Milch is, I suppose, right. Swearengen is a sentimentalist, his murders seemingly committed more in sorrow than in anger. He is the bloke who'll beat you up for slagging off his favourite pub. In this case the pub is the gents' loo and Swearengen, its proprietor, won't hear a word against it. </p> <p>\"Bullock, on the other hand, has a capacity for violence but it's combined with an ethical sense. You may not like him, just as many people do not like cops, but he is the only one anyone can go running to when something goes wrong.\" </p> <p>And in Deadwood almost everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Though all the characters are vivid (particularly memorable are Keith Carradine's utterly menacing Wild Bill Hickok and Robin Weigert's brutal and tragic Calamity Jane), the death count is so high (in the real settlement of Deadwood the murder rate was one a day) by the end of episode four we feel loth to become too attached to any of them. It is this savagely Hardyan fatalism that has offended so many fans of the western genre. And of course the not-so-small matter of the language. There are now internet sites devoted purely to totting up the number of profanities uttered in each episode. What also bewilders even fans of the series is just how British the swearing is. The word \"cunt\", for example, is in the US now the simplest, nastiest and most economically used way to brand a woman a superwhore. In Deadwood, however, the insult is aimed almost exclusively at men and is used in its present-day English sense, meaning superbastard. Milch, perhaps understandably, finds the issue of profanity more than a little absurd. He is monomaniacally devoted to getting things right and spent months researching the speech patterns of the early pioneers. You'd expect nothing less from a man who was recently arrested for driving while writing. </p> <p>\"There have been a great many people complaining that this is not the way people spoke in the wild west, but what they are really saying is that this is not the way people spoke in John Ford movies. Bad language is a form of armour, a way to assert strength and masculinity. Any society that is poor or lawless or violent uses profanity as a way of protection. Go to any inner-city ghetto from Los Angeles to Glasgow and you will find an excess of foul-mouthed men. To pretend that this was not the case in Deadwood, the most lawless and violent outpost of a lawless and violent country, is patently absurd.\" </p> <p>In the real-life city of Deadwood, as in the series, everything from religion to people and the environment is exploited. The town would eventually sit beneath a black cloud of cyanide as its bars pulled in $5,000 a day, and its prostitutes were considered so worthless they were in the words of Milch \"literally fucked to death\". It was, he says, hell on earth. Rarely has hell looked so compelling and terrible. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Deadwood, Tue, 10pm, Sky One</p>",
  "<b>Education</b> <p>This year lies halfway between 2020 and 1988, when Kenneth Baker, the then education secretary, delivered a package of measures that continue to define the modern educational era. In schools alone, the Education Reform Act introduced the national curriculum and testing at seven, 11 and 14; handed control of budgets to headteachers; and invented grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges, the precursors of specialist schools and city academies. </p> <p>Sixteen years on, some of the act's roughest edges have been smoothed, but the educational landscape is more than merely Baker-lite. Since 1988 Whitehall has meddled virtually at will in the content of the curriculum, prescribing huge chunks of the daily school timetables of children across the country. On the other hand, headteachers have become the most influential lobby group in education, as successive Tory and Labour governments pass ever greater power - and responsibility - towards them and away from local councils. And specialist schools have become this government's preferred model for (it believes) raising standards and (it hopes) persuading into the state fold some of the stubborn 7% of parents who continue to send their children to private schools.</p> <p>Maybe somebody - perhaps Gordon Brown if he changes his address by one digit - will abandon specialist schools and the perverse logic of expecting big rural comprehensives to focus on a particular area. </p> <p>But how wide will the changes in education really be by 2020? Heads will still hold the purse strings and local education authorities will probably not even exist. The best guess is that something called, and reminiscent of, the national curriculum will still be in place. Possibly this will be confined to five- to 14-year-olds, especially if trends to greater specialisation and differentiation from 14 on continue. If the government can get a positive consensus on the proposals in Mike Tomlinson's final report, in October, on reform of education of 14- to 19-year-olds, that will become more likely. </p> <p>Fourteen will have replaced 16 as the watershed moment in secondary education, with many more students taking vocational courses. There will be new qualifications to replace GCSEs and A-levels, the exams hardly anyone fails. But students will also take fewer exams: the generation at university now have had the worst of that. But there are almost bound to be complaints in 2020 about the failure to deliver \"parity of esteem\" between work-related and academic learning. There is nothing to suggest industry will deliver the input and enthusiasm to really turn that around.</p> <p>Taking a wider view, it is likely that many children will be taught in classes of 50 or more, with teachers working in teams, with other teachers or groups of classroom assistants. No counter-revolution will be able to obliterate that trend. The status of the teaching profession will still be diminished and the government will not have been able to convince jobseekers that the classroom is the place for them. Most of the best graduates will continue to turn their backs on teaching, to the constant complaints of the (by then) single classroom teachers' union. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Will Woodward is the Guardian's education editor</p> <p><b>Transport</b></p> <p>As they power along eight-lane motorways in their Asian-built electric cars - set to cruise control, naturally - drivers in 2020 will have plenty of time to think about how they will pay their next road-charge bill. A monthly envelope totting up the cost of each car journey will be routine by the end of the next decade if the government's long-term transport plans are anything to go by.</p> <p>Satellite tracking technology will enable the authorities to monitor every car journey - how long it took, how far it was, how fast it was - to calculate a journey charge of up to \u00a31.30 a mile. Driving in many of Britain's cities will require a congestion charge; many motorway journeys will be punctuated by toll booths.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, wants to begin levying a price for road space.

But without such a radical change, the future for motorists will be bleak. </p> <p>Wages, wanderlust and globalisation are fuelling a desire to travel. Professor Marcial Echenique of Cambridge University reckons that, by 2021, we will all clock up an extra 1,000 miles a year by road or rail - raising the prospect of rush hours lasting from 5am until midday. \"The congestion will extend, so there will be no period without congestion,\" Prof Echenique warned in a study published earlier this year.</p> <p>Maverick motoring groups who blow up speed cameras will have more to get militant by 2020. A government-funded initiative on trial at Leeds University is examining the possibility of cars having \"intelligent\" accelerators that resist when drivers try to break the speed limit. Traditional speed humps are likely to go in favour of advanced models, which will sink for slower vehicles but stiffen to impede speeders. Many commuter routes will have high-occupancy vehicle lanes for cars with at least two people on board. To help pay their five-figure annual tuition fees, students will be hiring themselves out as passengers.</p> <p>The alternatives to motoring are likely to suffer from familiar problems. Network Rail reckons that by 2015 it can bring punctuality on the railways up from 81% to 91.7%. Says Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics: \"There are some eternal verities about transport policy. One is the maladministration of the railways and the fact that they're forever teetering on the brink of some form of Beeching's axe.\"</p> <p>On the bright side, both east and west coast mainlines ought to have been upgraded by 2020, with superior signalling allowing twice as many trains between London, the north of England and Scotland. But while tilting technology will be commonplace, there is little indication the money will be forthcoming to push speeds beyond the present maximum of 125mph.</p> <p>Commuters in the south-east will benefit from an upgrade to Thameslink and from high-speed local trains through Kent on the Channel tunnel rail link. The East London Line will be extended and joined to other suburban tracks to create an \"inner rail ring road\" around the capital. But only the most devoted optimists can confidently predict that Crossrail, the \u00a310bn east-west link across London, will be built by 2020.</p> <p>Britain's Victorian railway network will never be likely to match its German or Japanese rivals in speed and reliability for long-distance journeys. The disastrous \u00a37.5bn, decade-long struggle to model the west-coast mainline is likely to cast a shadow over rail policy for decades, deterring ambitious state schemes.</p> <p>Aviation could play a much bigger part in domestic transport. In a white paper on aviation last year, the government backed new runways at Stansted, Heathrow, Birmingham and Edinburgh. Government figures say the number of passengers using Britain's airports will leap from 189m to 460m by 2020.</p> <p>Heathrow will no longer be the world's busiest international airport, losing out through lack of space to Paris and Amsterdam. But journeys from Bournemouth to Newcastle or between London and Plymouth could well be on fast, cheap aircraft.</p> <p>Whether a Labour, Conservative or UK Independence party government is in power in 2020, the job of secretary of state for transport will still be a hiding to nothing. The challenges of congestion and pollution will persist. Travellers are likely to have more choice in how they get from A to B and their journeys will probably be safer. But whether moving around will be quicker, cheaper or more reliable than today is deeply doubtful.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrew Clark is the Guardian's transport correspondent</p> <p><b>Immigration</b></p> <p>Immigration will feature ever more strongly in daily politics as the 21st century unfolds. In Britain immigration will be seen as an essential component of economic growth and a prerequisite for a healthy economy. But this will not happen in the same way as in the US and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries, when they built multicultural societies on a positive historical legacy of integrating waves of migrants through the common goal of citizenship.</p> <p>Instead, by 2020 British immigration policy will be founded on the fact of our ageing society. Britain will have fewer people of working age trying to support a growing number of retired people. Britain is likely to encourage immigration on a scale that current levels only hint at, but in the process there is a danger we will develop a two-tier workforce that has more in common with the gastarbeiter economy of the old West Germany than on any American melting pot example.</p> <p>The basis for that prediction lies in the United Nations report Replacement Migration, published in 2000. It estimated that Britain needs to attract a million people a year between now and 2050 to maintain the balance between the workforce and the retired population. That might be regarded as unduly pessimistic, but even the most recent figures from the government actuary suggest that by 2020 there will be 20% more older people than younger adults. </p> <p>The majority of people in their 60s and 70s will be healthy and active; they will demand ever more consumer items and the personal services that go with increased leisure time. There will also be a growing welfare sector to care for the ageing population. The retirement homes of Bournemouth and Eastbourne will become key models for economic regeneration projects across the country. Home Office studies predict this will mean an increase in low-paid, low-skilled jobs that may be difficult to fill from the existing labour force.</p> <p>The pattern is already beginning to emerge in the hospitality and catering industries, where low-wage jobs with little security are increasingly being filled by migrants. The government's role is to ensure they can come here legally and get paid the minimum wage. But for this strategy to succeed longer-term, British governments will have to have come to terms with the flourishing hidden economy of illegal migrants. Otherwise the two-tier workforce will be even more likely. </p> <p>That means that a way to \"regularise\" the position of illegal migrants already in Britain will have to be found. By 2020 it could become a regular feature of British life, with amnesties granted to illegal immigrants before each general election. And if you think that could not happen, look to the US. Earlier this year, President George Bush thought it politic to give three-year work permits and possible citizenship to up to eight million \"undocumented\" workers living mainly in New Mexico and Arizona. His \"compassionate conservative\" move was, of course, really an attempt to capture the increasingly powerful Hispanic vote. Migrants here could soon hold equivalent political power.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor</p> <p><b>Economy</b></p> <p>Forecasting the economy is a mug's game. Who in the aftermath of the three-day week in 1974 would have predicted that by 1990 Britain would be down to a handful of pits and that the National Union of Mineworkers would be shrivelled and beaten? Who in 1984 would have bet that the early brick-like mobile phones would become the fastest-spreading technology in history?</p> <p>On the big assumption that current trends continue, we should expect the UK to become even more dominated by the service sector, the City and the south-east. Europe's wealth is concentrated in a so-called golden banana that runs from northern Italy, through western Germany, eastern France and the Benelux countries and on across the Channel. While Europe's centre of gravity has moved eastward with enlargement, the plains of Lombardy, Bavaria, the Seine basin and the London diaspora will be the continent's unchallenged economic powerhouse for the next two decades at least. </p> <p>As far as the rest of the world is concerned, the big story will be the continued emergence of the three big developing countries - China, Brazil and India. In sheer size, rather than per capita incomes, these countries may soon rank behind only the US. Europe's demographics and its sluggish growth rate mean it will stay rich but be in relative economic decline.</p> <p>That's the easy bit. In reality, things will probably work out differently. The optimistic scenario is that the new wave of inventions over the past couple of decades has pushed the global economy to the cusp of a new golden age. All previous long upswings were based on technological change, and in this view the internet, the mapping of the human genome and robotics are to the coming boom what the car, the plane and the cinema were to the postwar golden age.</p> <p>The pessimistic view is that the future of the global economy is jeopardised by two big threats - one financial, the other environmental. Over the past decade, there has been a rise both in the number of financial crises and in the damage they have caused. With the US awash with personal debt, and running massive trade and budget deficits, the danger is that the next crisis will not be in a developing country like Argentina but at the very heart of the global economy.</p> <p>The other danger is that nobody has worked out what to do if and when the oil runs out. This is an issue that has been ducked by policy makers since the Yom Kippur war in 1973 brought to an end the long postwar boom. </p> <p>So there you have it. You can be an optimist and you can be a pessimist. Or, like me, you can be an optimistic pessimist: things look good in the long term, but there's plenty of choppy water to navigate first.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor</p>",
  "The haze of mid-July hangs over Happisburgh. A great fug of warmth smothers the tourists and motor cars flowing as sluggishly as treacle towards the coast in search of some brisk maritime air. They find it where wind whips off the North Sea, through the dunes, up Beach Road, and over the cricket field to dance among the branches in the churchyard. <p>Happisburgh is a village of some 850 people, sitting on the Norfolk coast, 40 miles north-east of Norwich. There is a pub, a post office, a primary school, and tentative claims to have housed Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Dickens. There is even a resident ghost, who goes by the rather gruesome moniker of the Happisburgh Torso. Rising up out of the cluster of houses are St Mary's Church and, a little way out, a red-and-white-striped lighthouse, each gazing staunchly out over the sea: God and man levelling an ever watchful eye over the waves.</p> <p>In the case of Happisburgh that watch is increasingly necessary. For centuries the coast here has been steadily, silently eroding; the sedimentary rock that formed 12,000 years ago is proving no match for the might of the North Sea. In the past few years, the erosion has gathered pace and it is now moving six times faster than the experts had predicted - in just 15 years, 25 seafront homes have been lost and many more teeter on the edge. A 2001 report claimed the parish church might be likely to disappear within 20 years. By 2020, Happisburgh as we know it may very well not exist. The government has already written it off.</p> <p>It is a most forlorn tale, one exacerbated by bureaucracy, politics and the lack of hard cash. In 1958 wooden revetments were built along the beach in an effort to damp the force of the waves, reducing the rate of erosion to a mere couple of inches a year. When the revetments were worn away in the early 1990s, after 35 years of faithful service, the district council removed them and began to speak of a concrete sea wall. Funds, however, were not forthcoming. Since then, there have been no replacement revetments, and the council has grown quiet on the subject of the sea wall. Meanwhile the sea has continued to lick slowly but steadily away at the coast, like a child with an enormous lollipop.</p> <p>\"It is a little worrying for a village which holds the backdoor key to the Norfolk Broads,\" says Malcolm Kirby, a retired company director who moved to Happisburgh five and a half years ago and now runs the Coastal Concern Action Group. He says there are a number of reasons for Happisburgh's terrible problems with erosion: an offshore granite reef system, for one; the hulking great concrete sea walls further up the coast, for another; and the aggregate dredging off Great Yarmouth, where, in the 11 years between 1992 and 2002, over 114 million tonnes were dredged from the area, making a hole in the coastline's natural defence system. \"There's nothing natural about this 3km gap where Happisburgh sits,\" Kirby says. \"Man has interrupted the natural situation, so he has no choice but to continue that defence.\"</p> <p> Meanwhile, the sea rises stealthily, tip-toeing up the coast when our backs are turned, each year adding to the weight of water that is sweeping away the rocks upon which Happisburgh stands. Global warming brings the sea level up 3mm every 12 months, and the shifting of tectonic plates adds a further 2mm, to make a net rise of 5mm a year. \"It doesn't sound very much,\" says Kirby. \"But when you look at the North Sea, the vastness of it, you can't imagine how much water is contained in that 5mm rise. It's mind-bogglingly huge.\" </p> <p>The next homes to succumb to the waves will be the stately Edwardian houses on Beach Road. \"And they can't be insured for landslip or heave,\" Kirby sighs. As the sea sneaks closer, the houses will be demolished and the residents offered council accommodation, but there will be no government compensation. The village suffers in other ways, too: should the erosion continue at its current pace, tourism will inevitably decline, and \"those eight weeks of summer to put enough meat round the bone\" - as Kirby puts it - will grow thinner. </p> <p>It is a strange truth that as our metropolises grow ever more corpulent, our island's very seams seem to be fraying. Happisburgh's passing will not only be the death of a village, but the loss of a sweet kernel of British life. It is how we all like to think of the British seaside, a Betjeman poem writ large: it is doors left unlocked, ice cream wafers on the front and the soft, slow swish of the sea against the shore. This is how we remember it, and this is how we wish it preserved, as in aspic. But the cold truth is that when we go back, it may not be there. </p> <p>If one wished to speculate on the future of Happisburgh, one need only gaze out to sea, where the remains of most of the village of Eccles lie beneath the waves. Legend holds that the village was swallowed up by the sea during the 17th century: one storm saw the loss of more than 70 houses, and with them, 300 lives. Skeletons from the Eccles churchyard still wash up on the shore.</p> <p>In the cool, quiet north-eastern end of St Mary's churchyard, away from the chatter and whooping of the tourists on the front, lies a mound, said to be where 119 men from the first HMS Invincible are buried. The ship set out from Yarmouth in 1801 as part of the Copenhagen fleet, but floundered offshore, with the loss of 400 of the ship's 552 members of crew. One hundred and nineteen were washed up on the coast at Happisburgh. \"Those 119 sailors are now many metres closer to the coast than when they were buried,\" muses Kirby. \"Are we going to let the sea have them back?\"</p>",
  "Baked beans. Big Ben. The blitz. Bobby Moore. Bannockburn. Some symbols of our identity appear as fixed cultural points in a changing landscape. Others crystallise particular moments, helping us define exactly who we are and how we are seen. <p>The current British self-image largely rests on images of expansionism and ingenuity. The idea of \"overcoming the odds\" runs deeply through our histories of ourselves. But like our faces as we age, our cultural identity can change imperceptibly. Suddenly, a reflection seen from a new angle shows an accumulation of tiny changes that significantly alters the overall appearance.</p> <p>Such reinterpretations of national identity are often triggered by an unexpected event: the abdication crisis of 1936; the blitz; Suez; the intervention of the International Monetary Fund in 1976; the 1984 miners' strike; the death of Diana - all had an impact on our national sense of self. So who might we be in 2020? Which of the myriad small changes currently taking place will define us? Which activities and institutions will dominate our sense of ourselves?</p> <p>One way to gauge the nature of the changes the nation is likely to undergo by 2020 is to look back the same distance in time. In 1988 EastEnders was Britain's most popular soap opera and Thatcherism was in its high summer. The major privatisations were behind us, but the poll tax was only just beginning to glimmer. House prices were booming but the stock market had crashed. Mobile phones were a novelty item and the second summer of love was in full swing in Manchester's clubland. Rumours about Charles and Diana's marriage troubles were beginning to spread. Nobody had uttered the words \"New Labour\" in public and conventional wisdom saw race riots as a thing of the past. The Berlin Wall stood intact.</p> <p>Much of that seems reassuringly familiar, but there have also been abrupt changes. The television programme that prompts office conversation is a real-life soap opera, with people locked in a house for three months. A CND supporter of the 80s is prime minister - and led us to war. The poll tax is a distant memory and that the nature of the monarchy has changed is beyond doubt, despite the leadership of the Firm remaining in place. The utterly unexpected can therefore materialise alongside the easily predictable. This will remain true as we go forward to 2020.</p> <p>We make sense of change partly by falling back on shared national or cultural characteristics: a psychological dependence on a successful past; confidence in one's own tolerance and sense of fair play; the maintenance of a particular family or religious tradition; a belief in one's own formative beliefs and values as radical, even once the comfortable trappings of middle age have been bought and paid for. But all these types of self-image will be tested by the way our society changes over the next generation. The question is whether we can respond in ways which strengthen or diminish them.</p> <p>The traditional analysis holds that the story of Britain over the past half-century is one of decline. Despite rising wealth, social freedoms and political projects dedicated to national renewal, we have struggled to overcome the pervasive decay. Our grand institutions - the trade unions, the church, the monarchy - are all in retreat. Britons' willingness to make an emotional or political investment in those external institutions has fallen dramatically. The number of people prepared to say they have great confidence in the legal system, the church, the civil service or parliament has more than halved since the early 1980s, from a healthy majority to a creaking minority. But asked who they trust to tell the truth, the British are more likely than 20 years ago to identify teachers, doctors, professors and newsreaders, and overall levels of trust appear not to have declined catastrophically, apart from trust in politicians.</p> <p>Although the erosion of traditional social organisations has not diminished our sociability, the onward march of individualism - either through choice or fate - is still probably the major force shaping our society. British society in 2020 will be significantly older than today, which will further that process of individualisation. Those over 65 will be a third as many again as those of working age, as opposed to a quarter as many again today. The combination of the postwar baby boom, increased life expectancy and declining fertility rates will mean a million more people over 65 than under 16. As a result we will spend twice as much money on health and long-term care.</p> <p>Intertwined with ageing is the shrinking size of our households, so that by 2020 about a third of us will be living alone, and as many as 2 million older people may have no regular contact with friends or family. These new household structures will also drive suburbanisation, as more people spill into the space between the inner-city neighbourhoods and the rural villages.</p> <p>How we communicate will help determine who we are - a transformation that has already begun with the mobile phone culture. Mobiles were barely a feature of life in 1988, but a recent survey found that 46% of young British adults described the loss of their phone as akin to bereavement. Phones are just one way we tell the world about ourselves. We can already construct historical and family narratives from the internet, create newsgroups and meet strangers with shared interests.</p> <p>We design our bodies in gyms and tattoo studios; by 2020 we could be doing so in the genetics lab and the prosthetic workshop. The use of diet and drugs to enhance performance will spread from elite sport and start a new mass debate about how to boost intelligence and educational achievement. So the cultural pressure to define and design ourselves will only grow between now and 2020. We cannot know how we will respond to those choices, but their very existence will make discussion of human nature and identity central to our self-perception.</p> <p>The changes in society will pit personal identity against the more traditional markers of collective belonging - the belief systems and rituals underpinning everything from politics and the church to television viewing and football supporting. People will still care about these activities, but they will be much less likely to organize their own lives around fixed institutional routines.</p> <p>Television over the past 50 years has reinforced our common identity and culture by amplifying shared social events. We would remember key TV moments, such as Gazza crying or Angela Rippon on Morecambe and Wise, and talk about them the next day. But the same forces that are fragmenting our cultural loyalties are at work on television, too. Already, about 60% of households have multichannel TV and the internet, and by 2020 the model of terrestrial broadcasting most of us grew up with will be a dusty memory.</p> <p>Given all this, the central question is: will the slow collapse of institutions that have been vehicles for our shared identity mean the collapse of the identity itself? The answer is that we should not be too afraid, for our essential cultural characteristic as Britons is, arguably, not the way we cling to past verities but the way we change with the cultural tides. A mixture of pragmatism and self-preservation has blended British culture and politics into new forms many times over the centuries. It is why Chaucer's 14th-century English would be unrecognisable to today's English speaker, and probably why English is now the global business language.</p> <p>This quality of pragmatism is experienced as tradition by many Britons, but as arrogance and ingenuity in equal measure by much of the rest of the world. It has enabled us to reinvent ourselves by stealth while maintaining a pose of continuity. In working out how this pattern might unfold over the next 16 years, three features of the landscape are especially influential.</p> <p>The first is hybrid culture, which is the art of mixing different elements to create a coherent whole - that is the logic by which ours was identified as a \"mongrel nation\" in Philip Dodd's 1995 Demos essay The Battle Over Britain. The second area is the rise of the city-region as a source of economic dynamism and a vehicle for identity. While regional government may continue to stutter, regional identities are strengthening. Third comes Britain's cultural relationship with the rest of the world; as power and wealth swing east towards Asia, this will develop into a form of reverse colonialism.</p> <p>This year's film of King Arthur self-consciously relocated the familiar legend to a different period - the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. If you forget the acting, the film is a masterclass in the art of myth-making through breeding hybrids. It purports to document the birth of a Greater Britain and the rise of its English icon, Arthur. The plot races through imperial withdrawal, Saxon invasion, Celtic resistance, the compassionate defence of women and children, an embryonic theory of equality through free will, military triumph against the odds, and romance, climaxing in intermarriage and the birth of a new British dynasty. Not bad for two hours, especially given the number of battles the film-makers had to slot in. King Arthur both portrays and typifies the art of cultural mixing that has made up the British identity. Our sense of what it means to be British has evolved from successive waves of settlement, conquest, intermingling, trade and exchange. One way in which we have done this is to construct institutions - the monarchy, armed forces, the civil service, the British Museum, the BBC - that have all enabled successful mixing by establishing shared symbols and traditions. Throughout the waves of change, however, those institutions - with their own distinct culture - have maintained a serene view that Britain exports civilisation through commonsense values and organisational methods. </p> <p>Helpful though it has been, that view does not match the reality. From baked beans to gin and tonic, from Birmingham balti to tea with milk, our trademark foods are the result of combining foreign cultural practices with local tastes. My great-grandfather entered family history in the 1940s on visiting a Chinese restaurant, inspecting the menu and declaring, \"I can't deal with any of this foreign nonsense; bring me a cup of tea.\" Hybridity has always been part of our lives, whether we realised it or not.</p> <p>Hybrid culture will have a special claim on the next generation, precisely because it holds the greatest cultural dynamism and energy. As tradition declines, we are left to form our identities while increasingly exposed, by global communications, travel and trade, to a much wider range of cultural influences and pressures. Amid an ageing population, for example, the fastest-growing ethnic category in Britain is \"black - mixed race\". Half the people in this group are under 16, while just 8% are over 45. The number of people from ethnic minorities grew by half during the 1990s, from less than 5% to almost 8% of the population.</p> <p>Film, television and literature are increasingly fascinated by what happens when cultures connect, collide and combine. From East is East and Goodness Gracious Me to Massive Attack and Mike Skinner, from Monica Ali to Ms Dynamite, Salman Rushdie to Irvine Welsh, our most potent pieces of culture emerge from the ability to meld the disparate elements at work in Britain into a coherent but edgy whole. This will spread from the arts into the wider culture. The brokers of our society will increasingly be those who can interpret and navigate such differences.</p> <p>Just as our culture evolves new hybrids, so will our politics. Politicians are increasingly absorbed in trying to handle the conflicts generated by cultural collision, from the US-EU split over Iraq to community division in Bradford and Burnley. However, despite the accelerating demographic trends, by 2020 it is unlikely that more than 15% of the whole British population will come from ethnic minority backgrounds. Race should not be the dominant issue of our political debate, but it will still be a trigger for wider debates about shared culture, as it is now. </p> <p>Perhaps most intriguing are the newly blended national cultures of Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In Scotland, the long wait for a constitutional settlement has been immediately followed by a wave of anti-political disillusionment. A recent survey found that only 2-3% of voters considered the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly to have serious influence over their lives. One of Scotland's main newspapers refused to endorse any party in the most recent Scottish parliamentary elections, an extraordinary event for so new a system. Yet as a current Demos project on Scotland in 2020 has found, there is strong commitment to creating a distinctive, creative and optimistic Scottish political identity that can circumvent dependence on political institutions.</p> <p>New, flexible governing arrangements will offer scaffolding to hybrid identities. It is no coincidence that this is happening at sub-national level. In Northern Ireland, the political rules are actually designed to allow two opposing nationalist cultures to coexist peacefully. In England the renaissance of city-regions is obscured by London's impact as a city-state and its tendency to suck in skills and wealth from surrounding areas. But, partly driven by economics, the cultural character and influence of major British cities are changing.</p> <p>The shape of these cities, from housing to neighbourhoods to transport links, was formed around the industries that provided most jobs: steel in Sheffield, the Liverpool docks, shipbuilding in Glasgow, chocolate-making in Birmingham and so on. Now they are being transformed by new patterns of wealth arising from other kinds of work: law, finance, media, software, science. Cultural activities, symbols and buildings play a newly important part in the shaping of city centres. \"Doughnut\" structures of wealth and travel - whereby money concentrates in city centres by day and travels into outer suburbs, new towns and commuter villages by night - are entrenching poverty at the neglected edges of cities. But the city-regions offer new symbols and forms of congregation. </p> <p>In the wider world, the global shift of economic, cultural and technological power eastwards will have a profound influence. China's rise will challenge the assumptions underpinning layers of our identity - from western interpretations of democracy to philosophies of class and well-being. But the economic dynamism of Asian nations will create a new need for us to compete for their attention, and to succeed in supplying services and know-how to them, rather than simply competing against them for jobs and investment. In a generation's time our wealth will be drawn, as it was in past eras, from our place within global networks of exchange.</p> <p>In navigating this new world, Britain has a great opportunity. Our colonial legacy ought to prompt mutual understanding and empathy with other cultures and nations, not just resentment at decline of our power or the injustices of past British rule. Much of the most important cultural production in English now arises from the cultures of the commonwealth, from places that were dominated and then abandoned by British institutions and have generated their own hybrid identities. By 2020 we will need to have turned our past to our advantage and engaged with our former empire again - this time as collaborator, rather than conqueror.</p> <p>But doing this requires us to overcome our equally strong tendency towards insularity, to engage more confidently with the unfamiliar, and to understand cultural difference better. Too often, a British (and especially English) attitude to the world has rested on the aggressive assertion of \"common sense\" - a tactic still used by Britons of all classes.</p> <p>In turn, our ability to engage properly with the world may rest on our success in finding new, popular vehicles for shared identity within Britain. Our capacity for creating hybrid identities from disparate ingredients is beyond dispute. But our success in doing so again by 2020 is not assured. It is perfectly plausible to see the splintering of identity and allegiance into many different cultural tribes; some socially conservative, insular and resentful, some hedonistically self-absorbed, some cosmopolitan but detached from the everyday life of most others. The diminishing influence of our institutions could leave no one with the power to mediate successfully between these mutually ignorant clans. </p> <p>So it would be too easy to conclude that we can all become naturally confident cosmopolitans. In a survey last year 77% of those polled said different cultures in Britain coexist rather than connect with each other. At the same time, however, 80% of the same survey thought we could not build a new British society without interacting with different cultures.</p> <p>Learning to live in a new society - especially one reflecting cultures profoundly different from the one you were born into - is a painful process, and for many people the incentives to make the effort are weak. But there are some grounds for hope. A study last year by Richard Florida, the prophet of the \"creative class\" in North America, found that tolerance and respect for difference in Britain are comparatively high in Britain compared to other European societies. There is clear evidence that people's interest in political issues and social fairness remains strong, even though they are less likely to engage through traditional channels.</p> <p>Who, then, will the new Briton be in 2020? Imagine a millennium baby, born in 2000, approaching 20 years old. She will have a life expectancy of 90 and will be trying to imagine a working life of at least 50 years. Her job prospects will depend heavily on her educational credentials, and she will expect at least five more years of formal training. Specialist skills, particularly ones that can be used creatively, will determine her earning power. She is already likely to be accumulating big debts in order to finance her pathway towards this specialist skill.</p> <p>Our young woman's network of friends and family will be crucially important to her; more so than her ethnic or national identity. That will continue a trend already in process: a study in the mid-90s found that most people saw their own values, principles and friends as being more important to their own identity than being a Briton; in the 2001 census, only 46% of people described themselves as British. This woman's informal network, though she may not yet know it, will have a profound influence on her future opportunities and life chances, and may play the most direct role in how far she travels in later life.</p> <p>The likelihood is that her social values will be more liberal even than today's typical young people, and that economic liberalism will largely look like common sense. Some specific \"ethical\" issue - maybe climate change or human rights or stem cell research - will dominate her political sense, but if she has joined a political party she will be among a tiny minority.</p> <p>Her knowledge of the detail of British history and sense of allegiance to a \"national\" culture will be significantly weaker than it might be today, but her critical abilities - communication, and the ability to access and investigate different forms of culture - are likely to be much sharper. She will customise her use of the dizzying array of media services with a degree of discrimination and fluency we would find surprising today.</p> <p>That sense of discernment might apply equally to her sense of identity, which will be moulded from family, neighbourhood and city. She might be a devout Christian, though she would be slightly more likely to be a practising Muslim. Either way, if it is a strong and explicit part of her identity, she may well have discovered a faith for herself and opted to join a specific community rather than simply inheriting a general tradition.</p> <p>By 2020 it is unlikely that our young adults will be \"citizens of the world\" in any full-blooded sense that really banishes British identity. Although a global outlook is increasingly common, it is hard to see how anyone could find forms of identity strong enough to channel allegiance in any meaningful way. But the attachments we form to particular organisations, causes or routines are the institutional expression of our values. If we take the globally connected outlook our millennium child will have, we can see that exclusively national institutions will have begun to overlap and blur with other layers of identity: time spent studying at European universities, working with American NGOs or living in cities to which she feels especially drawn. </p> <p>The strongest desire among younger generations in western societies is to shape their lives in accordance with their own values. That is not mindless hedonism or historical amnesia, but in 2020 we will still need strong institutional attachments. A healthy, durable collective identity will not flourish without them. But the most successful institutions of 2020 could be anything: colleges or campuses, new kinds of cooperative, online communities, sports clubs, issue-based campaigns or neighbourhood associations. They could thrive in a world where the Church of England, the civil service, the broadsheet newspaper or the BBC have ceased to exist. But whatever form they take, and whatever myths and symbols they project, theirs will be the task of negotiating the mix of foreign and familiar on which Britain has always been based. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tom Bentley is the director of the Demos thinktank (<a href=\"http:www.demos.co.uk\"> www.demos.co.uk</a>)</p>",
  "Very soon, you will be able to buy British figs in your supermarket. Lines of palm trees will sway on the south coast. Devon and Cornwall will begin to resemble the Azores, with blankets of ferns and evergreen trees crowding the countryside. Migrating birds will stay in the country for longer. And the seasons will become even more blurred. <p>Unfortunately, pests will also be on the increase. The mosquitoes so common in the sticky climes of southern Europe will start to invade Britain, too; rats and cockroaches will proliferate as we become increasingly urban and temperatures rise enough for them to survive the relatively mild winters. </p> <p>Environmental futurology is an inexact science. But it is certain our climate is changing. The effects of this change over the next 16 years will be subtle. If the predictions are correct (and the Gulf Stream stays where it is), the trend towards wetter winters and hotter, drier summers will continue. Summer droughts will become more commonplace and some of the southern parts of England (particularly Essex) will be subject to frequent flooding. Indeed, some parts of the county at the mouth of the Thames will probably become uninhabitable - because the homes there will be uninsurable.</p> <p>While the physical landscape of Britain undergoes these changes, the country's flora and fauna will see a much more subtle, often unnoticeable, alteration. Look out of your window and you will probably see leaves turning red and golden well before the supposed start of autumn. Frogspawn, usually an indicator of the start of spring, has been spotted in ponds on the south coast of England before Christmas. And some flowers - snowdrops, for example - have started to bloom at the height of winter.</p> <p>Tim Sparks, an environmental scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Monks Wood in Cambridgeshire, says his studies in phenology - an intricate science that involves recording the exact times during a year that things happen in the natural world - show that the blurring between the beginnings and ends of the seasons will only get worse. \"We have some records going back to the 18th century - there's been a lot of phenological change, particularly in the last 20 to 30 years,\" he says. \"As a rough rule of thumb, we've seen spring events advance by some three weeks over the last 50 years. Between now and 2020, we may well see a similar advance in phenology if the country warms as predicted.\" The occasional sightings of snowdrops and frogspawn before the end of the year will become much more common.</p> <p>There is also evidence that trees are starting to break bud much earlier. Dr Simon Leather, an ecologist at Imperial College London, studies trees. \"I've seen big changes in timing of bud burst - when the leaves start to come out,\" he says. \"And that's a temperature effect.\" Sycamore and bird cherry trees are classic examples.</p> <p>These changes in the seasons are not just a scientific curiosity. Many animals rely on their sources of food - plants, for example - being ready to eat exactly when they are needed. At the start of spring when there are plenty of young around, for example.</p> <p>\"We're probably already going to see some evidence of a mismatch between different bits of the natural world working together,\" says Julian Hughes, the head of species conservation at the RSPB. \"You can imagine that if spring [bird] migrants start arriving from Africa earlier than they do at the moment, they would therefore arrive before quite a lot of the food does, in terms of emerging insects. Even for common things like blue tits and great tits, if the caterpillar hatches emerge at a different time from when the broods are hatching, then clearly it's going to have a problem. We might also be starting to see some evidence of that.\" </p> <p>The fractionally warmer weather will also ensure that new types of plant will thrive in Britain. \"You have to recognise that this is a country of gardeners, and what is more and more in fashion now is that we have exotic plants in the gardens,\" says Dr Johannes Vogel, the keeper of botany at the Natural History Museum. \"And more and more are going to escape and establish in the wild.\"</p> <p>Plants such as laurel - certainly not hardy enough to be a native of these shores - have already been identified as having established themselves from a gardener's seeds in the south-west of England. The last time laurel grew in Britain was literally in another age - well before the last ice age, in fact.</p> <p>\"We will get more and more of these non-hardy plants, the ones which hard winters would normally knock back,\" says Vogel. </p> <p>Rhododendron is growing wild in north Wales - one of many plants for which the conditions just keep getting better. \"There's undoubtedly going to be other species which are not quite in their optimal climate at the moment, but if you raise it by a few degrees in the summer and make the winters milder, then they might be and they may take off,\" says Sparks. Palm trees already manage to survive on the south coast of England and it is only a matter of time before they, too, are thriving further north.</p> <p>The warm weather will not just affect the \"exotic\" plants introduced by gardeners. \"At the moment about 31% of people cut their grass in the winter in the south-west of Britain and 8% in Scotland. The numbers in both are likely to increase - many more people are likely to be cutting the grass in winter because it will continue to grow,\" says Sparks. </p> <p>If climate change will have the biggest effect on our changing wildlife, what we do with the land will also have an impact. Plans to build thousands of houses, for example, are sure to change the shape of the countryside. \"We're going to see a lot more concrete and asphalt in the south, which is going to have major impacts on a lot of wildlife,\" says Leather. And increased urbanisation will mean cities exert a stronger \"heat island\" effect. London is a few degrees warmer than its surroundings, for example, and the bigger it grows, the greater the effect of the heat island. In some German cities, warmer conditions have led to the establishment of termite colonies. Devon has already had these unwelcome visitors and it could be London next. Anyone in buildings with structural timbers should watch out. </p> <p>More houses also means more household waste. \"We're going to get more flies around,\" says Leather. \"We're going to get the sorts of things that are associated with sticky climates - we have mosquitoes but what we may get are some of the mosquitoes that can transmit some of the nasty things.\" In short, that could mean malaria (see panel).</p> <p>But there is good news. The increased flooding due in the south of England thanks to climate change has the potential to cause the birth of new wetlands and marshlands. The government is currently scratching its head on what to do about people living in the flood plains (the options include moving them out or installing flood barriers). If it decides to allow the waters to run and move the people out, wildlife will benefit. Then, says Vogel, we will once more have extensive river ecosystems. \"If you let the rivers meander and don't stem them and don't try to protect houses from flooding, you will get superb wildlife areas.\"</p> <p>Historically, farming has been one of the great drivers of countryside change, and that will continue. \"The focus of agriculture since the war has been to maximise productivity,\" says Dr Matthew Thomas, an agricultural ecologist at Imperial College. \"One of the changes that's happening in farming at the moment is an increased awareness of managing the landscape, not just for goals of productivity but to see how one can balance productivity with benefits for wider society and the environment.\" </p> <p>One big contributor to that process currently is reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). \"What this means is that farmers won't get subsidised for production per se - subsidies will be on the basis of production based on market forces,\" says Professor Richard Ellis, the head of the school of agricultural policy and development at Reading University. </p> <p>\"You could see changes in the incentives to grow certain crops,\" adds Thomas. \"You could see a shift to new energy crops, for instance, or fibre crops or pharmaceutical crops. Very large, uniformly managed environments or landscapes can be maintained relatively profitably. Smaller, individual farmers might find it more difficult to respond to some of these changes.\" Some land will simply drop out of production. The hills of Wales, the Pennines and Scotland, for example, are already difficult to eke a living from. After CAP reform the farmers who work them may be forced to give up. </p> <p>And how will the changes in farming affect our wildlife? \"The extent to which those are going to impact on individual species is, in many cases, rather unclear,\" says Thomas. \"Many species of invertebrate have scope and capacity to shift their ranges and shift with the changing landscape and changes in land use.\" How we perceive our countryside will also affect how we allow it to change. \"There could be considerable pressure to maintain the classic patchwork landscape of hedgerows and fields and a few cows or sheep dotted around, because that's what society wants from the landscape and that's what it perceives as a healthy and vibrant landscape,\" says Thomas. </p> <p>But what people want from an aesthetic point of view may go against what is actually best for conservation. \"Coppice woodland is better on a rotational basis for biodiversity than a wood that's dying and hasn't been cut back for 70 to 80 years,\" says Ellis. \"But often mature woodland looks extremely attractive to people, even though it's dying.\"</p> <p>Will we have to adapt to a new idea of the British green and pleasant land, then? That really depends on how you define \"British\". \"Our perception of what flora and fauna we perceive as being British will change,\" concludes Vogel. \"Also, it will become much more difficult for 'experts' to recognise what is actually British.\" By experts, he means not only botanists and zoologists toiling in the country's universities and museums, but also the armies of amateur naturalists who spend their evenings and weekends scouring the country in search of rare birds, plants and insects.</p> <p>The country will still be populated by species of animal and plant. They may not be the species we want to protect; in fact, they are more likely to be the ones capable of adapting to more extreme conditions. The species we are already trying to save are liable to be more susceptible to the changes ahead. Summer droughts may have an adverse effect on some of the rarer butterflies, for example. Conversely, the milder winters may increase the number of pest species we get - rats would thrive simply because their winter survival rate will be better. \"There are always species that will succeed in any environment, but they will change and we may not necessarily like the ones we end up with,\" says Sparks.</p> <p>\"If you want to say that there is a need for us to protect what is British, then of course we are going to lose,\" cautions Vogel. \"If you want to say we want to maximise diversity, then we are on to a winner.\"</p> <p>Ellis points out that change is a natural part of the life of the British countryside. \"It's worth remembering that the landscape has gone through quite a lot of changes in the last 70 to 80 years,\" he says. \"Often when people are looking back, they're looking back to a small snapshot in history which is the one that they want - maybe the 1930s, when things were difficult for agriculture, whereas many non-farmers think of it as a golden time.\"</p> <p>The difference now, though, is the pace of the change. \"I don't think that we've ever seen changes at the sort of speed that we are experiencing and that we are predicted to experience in the next 20 to 50 years,\" adds Hughes.</p> <p>Here we get into politics. We can be fairly sure what will happen to our climate - and hence to our countryside - in the next 20 years because we know about the carbon that is already in the atmosphere. What happens after that is less certain and depends on what the governments of the world do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That matters because we can't know if we are making the right preparations for change if we do not know what changes are likely to happen. \"You can overspeculate and there is a risk that we make a whole load of decisions to change things now that actually prove to be the wrong thing,\" says Hughes.</p> <p>We are also hampered by our lack of knowledge about the present: we have records for only a fifth or so of the flora and fauna on these islands. \"There's still great uncertainty,\" says Sparks. \"While we probably know more about our wildlife than anywhere else in the world, we're still conscious of the lack of knowledge in some areas.\" That ignorance is unlikely improve in the immediate future. </p> <p>Vogel says getting to know more about the country's flora and fauna and creating a comprehensive inventory of wildlife is a major objective for scientists. \"For politicians, it might be more opportune to remain ignorant and say, 'Well, we didn't know.'\" A little bit of knowledge, he adds, might actually be a dangerous thing for politicians, because they would then be forced to address some of the concerns for the future that understanding the present would bring.</p> <p>Nevertheless, says Vogel, we need to know exactly what lives on these shores, and on this earth. \"For the long-term survival of humans with the creatures that share this planet, it is of very great importance.\"</p>",
  "Over the past year, GNL and I have shared a common bond: both of us have undergone environmental audits. While I can boast that I'm personally responsible for fewer carbon emissions than the seven-storey building at 119 Farringdon Road (although I do, I confess, still take the lift more than the stairs), both of us have received similar overall ratings from our auditors: \"Good effort, but still room for improvement.\" <p>My own audit was part of an ethical living experiment I have been undertaking and charting for G2. The experiment's conception was partly a reaction to the long-running conundrum newspapers face of how to get more readers excited by weighty, important subjects such as social and environmental responsibility without coming across as preachy and worthy in tone.</p> <p>The idea was to utilise the \"innocent abroad\" approach by taking someone who didn't naturally concern himself with such things - shamefully, me - and challenging him to try to change his ways, reporting on the high and lows of the conversion process along the way. Quickly realising that my willpower wasn't even up to turning down the allure of a daily KitKat from the office trolley, let alone overhauling my entire lifestyle, I asked for help in the form of a elite squad of ethical auditors.</p> <p>Three people made the grade and accepted the challenge - one from Friends of the Earth, one from the Soil Association, and one from Ethical Consumer magazine. They then spent a day at my home auditing my family's lifestyle in brutally frank detail (even my wife and baby daughter failed to escape their excoriating gaze) before issuing reams of recommendations for change.</p> <p>But another, more powerful, motivating force soon made itself felt - the Guardian reader. Before the ethical living articles started in G2, Guardian Unlimited invited me to keep a weblog, or internet diary, of my journey. Beneath my diary entries an email address was made available for readers to send me their own tips, advice and views, the best of which would also be published on the site.</p> <p>Whether offering criticism or praise, it is always welcome and fruitful when a journalist receives correspondence from a reader. But where I had hoped for, at best, a few dozen emails, I actually ended up being sent more than 500. Furthermore, because of GU's international readership, I received a diverse range of advice and encouragement from readers as far away as Beijing and Arkansas.</p> <p>In combination, they had a profound and unpredicted effect on my experiment. Most significantly, they led me to greatly expand the scope of the experiment and move it beyond its initial remit of focusing simply on environmental responsibility and to consider, in addition, much wider \"ethical\" issues, such as personal responsibility for, say, the decline in local community spirit, or how best to give time and money to charity. Readers even asked me to consider whether it's ethical to have children.</p> <p>(I have to say I certainly never banked on being required to contemplate the planned obsolescence of our species as part of the challenge. I naively thought before it started that it would amount to little more than placing bricks in cisterns and recycling some cans.)</p> <p>Due to this interaction with readers, the experiment has been a much-cherished, personal lesson in how readers can engage with newspaper articles - be it leading them to scream and shout at the words before them, or to chuckle and nod in acknowledgement or, hopefully, to challenge their assumptions. It has also shown me how much readers are keen to express and share their opinions about what newspapers publish. The Guardian now has a number of forums in which readers keenly offer their collective wisdom - the letters page, of course, but also places such as Notes and Queries, Private Lives, and Guardian Unlimited's ever-feisty message boards.</p> <p>But most importantly, perhaps, it has shown me how much readers care and want to read about issues such as social responsibility and the environment; issues that they closely associate with the Guardian and Observer. And, judging by some of the reaction, they evidently appreciate it when we practise what we preach.</p> <p>However, I do openly admit that I have drawn the line at some reader advice: \"The most sustainable food source is skips,\" wrote one reader from Leeds rather cheerily. \"They're quicker, cheaper and more fun than trekking round a crowded supermarket. You also end up experimenting with stuff you wouldn't normally buy. We now have two kinds of artichoke in our fridge. A bit too radical for you? Well, that's journalists for you, always afraid to get your hands dirty. You could always use gloves!\"</p> <p><a>money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a></p>",
  "Twenty minutes into launching the Liberal Democrat draft manifesto (\"Freedom, fairness, trust\") came the inevitable \"left or right?\" question from the press. If our faces fell, it was because the question has become so meaningless. <p>The terms left and right became fixed in the lexicon in an era when the great political debate centred internationally on the fight between communism and the market economies, and in Britain between a Labour party committed to state ownership and the Conservatives committed to privatisation. \"Left\" was shorthand for nationalisation, strikes, state spending and state controls - and \"fairness\" (usually termed \"equality\") even at the cost of enforced conformity. \"Right\" meant privatisation, cutting spending on schools and hospitals, traditional views on \"moral\" issues, law and order - and \"freedom\" (usually meaning the right to spend your cash) even at the cost of injustice. </p> <p>Liberals were derided as the \"soggy centre\" precisely because we wanted spending so that schools and hospitals were of high quality, but also smaller central government. We opposed much nationalisation, but supported tougher consumer protection and pro-competition policies. We championed freedom of the individual, but tempered by equal access to education and health and a safety net of social welfare for when things go wrong. We sought balance - and are now rarely criticised for it because just about everyone has recognised we were right. </p> <p>With the collapse of the state ownership model, the Labour party seeks to outflank the Conservatives on \"choice\". Meanwhile, no longer united to see off socialism, the Conservatives are split down the middle between social libertarians and family values moralists. Left and right still have emotive and negative meanings to many people, so these days our political opponents like to use them about the Liberal Democrats - and rarely about themselves. Would the prime minister declare he is leftwing? Or Michael Howard that he is proud to be a rightwinger? </p> <p>Liberal Democrats refuse to be pigeonholed into left or right. We believe that the 20th-century division into left and right failed because society needs both freedom and fairness. As LT Hobhouse and the New Liberals said a hundred years ago, \"the struggle for liberty... is the struggle for equality\". Basically, people can't be free if they don't have the chance of decent education, health, and freedom from the fear of poverty in sickness or old age. Today we'd add that there isn't much freedom in a decaying environment either. But we don't want state control or regimentation. The political debate has moved on. Especially on to that much older division, liberal or illiberal. </p> <p>Take this example. David Blunkett and David Davis would both leave asylum seekers destitute, want every citizen to carry an ID card and have supported the removal of the right to silence. Left and right, but equally illiberal. Liberal Democrats oppose these measures because we believe it is vital to protect the citizen from an over-mighty state. So the press label us leftwing. We say it's liberal. </p> <p>Then we propose measures to remove subsidies to big business and cut back central government and they say we have shifted to the right. But liberals have always championed small central government and the free market economy, to maximise individual and local choice. </p> <p>The draft manifesto we published this week is not left or right - but it is firmly liberal. Take two examples. The first of these is giving more power to people who use and work in public services. It's our view that schools and hospitals will deliver better results to citizens when they are locally accountable. </p> <p>We also think that improvements will come when professionals are freed from the central government interference that the Tories introduced and which Labour has multiplied. That does not fit anywhere in the left-right divide, but is thoroughly liberal. </p> <p>Take also the environment. Labour and the Conservatives have traditionally neglected it. Conservatives have aimed for minimal government involvement in the economy, to give business as free a rein as possible. Labour has sought to create jobs in the short term, with little regard to which jobs are most sustainable. The liberal approach is to use markets to persuade people to act in ways that are environmentally sustainable, particularly using the tax system to encourage green behaviour. All underpinned by a passionate commitment to the environment as a duty to future generations. That approach has been sadly lacking from left-right political debates, but it is a core aspect of liberalism. </p> <p>All of this poses great challenges for political commentators, who look for simplistic soundbites even more than politicians do. But go out of the Westminster bubble and people have moved on. They want to be treated as individuals, not classes. It is time politicians (and the press) had the same maturity. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Matthew Taylor MP is chairman of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:taylorm@parliament.uk\">taylorm@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The strange thing about New York fashion week is that the clothes on the catwalk are by far the least interesting thing about it. As a spectacle, it is fabulous, like a visit to a strange but beautiful world. (It even has its own language: a \"row pas\" is a faux pas in the seating arrangements.) The front row is utterly riveting. Led by Anna Wintour, who is flanked at all times by three bodyguards, their militaristic dedication to fashion perfection and forensic levels of grooming would make a Stepford Wife look like Kelly Osbourne. It is also a freak show of Atkins over-achievers: every time I come here, I think the editors can't possibly get any thinner, and every season they prove me wrong. And this being New York, there are proper celebrities in town to attend shows - Jack Nicholson, Jennifer Lopez - rather than the soap stars and Twit girls who fill the prime seats in London. Because of this, a never-ending media torrent of rumour, gossip and tabloid bitchiness ensures that the atmosphere verges on hysterical at all times. There is so much to look at. Until the lights go down, that is. </p> <p>The trouble with the clothes is that New York is obsessed with looking rich. Looking wealthy is way more important than looking stylish, or even looking sexy. Which makes for a lucrative fashion industry but terrifically dull, one-note and unsubtle designs. Unlike with the Parisian notion of chic, there is no sense here of wanting to look a little mysterious, a little intriguing. There is no Je ne sais quoi about a cropped mink jacket dyed turquoise: it says, loud and clear, \"I have so much money that I wear furs in summer, too.\" Michael Kors, the uptown girls' favourite designer, personified this obsession in an interview with fashion newspaper the Daily earlier this week: \"If you look like you have to dress for the weather, you look poor. A woman who wears sleeveless dresses and sandals in a snowstorm, you automatically think she's got a car and driver waiting nearby.\" </p> <p>Now, I would love to give Kors the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is joking but on the evidence of his show, I can't help thinking he's at least partly serious. Entitled \"Greek Chic\", the collection set its sights on the jet-set glamour of a millionaire's yacht, all dry-clean-only swimwear and serious jewels brought out of the safe for cocktails. But the tiger-striped kaftans, python-print bikinis, white jeans and black sunglasses were more Jackie Collins than Jackie Onassis. As the New York Times put it rather acidly the following morning, \"while the clothes looked very rich and glamorous, the view was somehow limited\". </p> <p>Ralph Lauren has, if such a thing is possible, an even narrower world view than Kors, although he is too smooth a businessman to crack jokes about it in interviews. His collection of marabou-trimmed pale satin evening dresses, stiff white organza blouses and glossy pink sash bows were unimpeachably pretty but looked oddly like the wardrobe of a pampered Park Avenue seven-year-old who has grown six foot tall and borrowed mummy's pearl earrings. \"We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy,\" sang Ella Fitzgerald on the soundtrack. You'd have to, really, because these were clothes fit only for a super-sanitised Disney-fied version of New York life. </p> <p>Narciso Rodriguez is the designer of choice for New York women who want everyone to know that they are rich, but have a teeny bit too much self-awareness to embrace the Kors look. This is pared-down luxury, with an emphasis on pale, fine fabrics and a narrow, streamlined silhouette, for the customer who is prepared to spend $500 on the ultimate jersey vest. Clothes, in other words, for the woman who has everything: this season, she'll doubtless be ordering the pale rose, high-waisted silk dress. </p> <p>Even the younger American designers seem entirely at home with the Monopoly approach to fashion. Behnaz Sarafpour ensured her uptown-girl clientele felt at home by setting her show in Tiffany &amp; Co on Fifth Avenue, and accessorising her super-feminine collection - gorgeous kimono print high-waisted dresses for day and fluid columns of metallic sequins for night - with diamond tiaras and sapphire chandelier earrings. Zac Posen, who is barely old enough to drink, has a clientele that includes the president's daughters, and Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs as a business partner. He said in an interview this week that he sees himself as \"building a luxury goods company\" - a quote that you cannot imagine any of his London peers, with their penchant for staging catwalk shows in chilly high-rise car parks, coming out with. This collection was sleeker and sexier than his previous designs, with elegant trousers and body-conscious shapes: a nod, perhaps, to Tom Ford, the Texan ex-Gucci designer and multi-millionaire. </p> <p>Three European designers in town this week proved that there is another way to be successful in New York. Ghost, showing here for the first time, seemed like an innocent abroad with their trademark refreshingly simple ice-cream colours and classic sundresses. Matthew Williamson also stuck to what he does best: a Sienna Miller-friendly, Ibiza-inspired wardrobe, with boho-chic smocked muslin and fluttery-hemmed rainbow prints, all worn with gold-weave goddess sandals. Roland Mouret brought a welcome touch of sophistication, with divine Jackie O collared skirt suits in soft metallics, cut just-so but in unusual fabrics so that they were proper but not prim. For evening, jersey dresses were wrapped and knotted across bare flesh to dramatic effect. </p> <p>But going against the grain can cause an uproar. The designer Bryan Bradley of Tuleh recently caused a mini-crisis on the Upper East Side by loudly distancing himself from the high-society image of his label. \"Bradley is not a Lady Who Lunches. He is a 38-year-old gay man who is frank about sex and drug use, smokes cigarettes, drinks a lot of Scotch and has an inherent dislike of bourgeois ideals,\" concluded an interviewer from Womenswear Daily. This collection, which eschewed twinsets and pastel shifts for lace dresses under rubber coats and a rude-word print, had a noticeably cooler reception than previous seasons. Luella Bartley is also at odds with the New York look. At first, her show seemed to suggest that she had gone native since moving to America: the first model wore a white polo shirt, pristine wide-legged trousers and a crocodile belt, as if she had stepped straight out of a Ralph Lauren advert. But before long, what Luella calls her \"classics\" began to appear: drainpipe jeans, biker jackets (this time cropped and pink) and blazers \"inspired by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Think 1970s Pacha.\" The New York Times was not convinced. Luella \"lacked any of a New Yorker's sense of polish,\" it sniffed. </p> <p>Diane von Furstenberg is adored by New York society despite her free and easy style - this season, lots of African textile prints and wild colour combinations - because she was born in Europe and used to be married to a prince. Marc Jacobs gets away with odd shapes and kooky combinations because le tout New York knows that without him, the city would have precious little in the way of new ideas to call its own. Calvin Klein and Donna Karan are both able to rise above the show-me-the-money look, by virtue of having built their empires at a time when it was fashionable to look as if you were powerful and busy, with interests beyond calories and lapdogs. This season, Klein (now designed by Francisco Costa) was a serenely beautiful succession of slim silhouettes in every shade from jade green to Masai orange. Donna Karan was rooted, too, in urban glamour of the Wall Street rather than Park Avenue type: the collection was dominated by every shade of grey, from palest silver to charcoal, pepped up with eye-poppingly lurid accessories. It is a strange day when Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, models of global capitalism, seem positively bohemian amid this coterie of unashamed flashness. Bring back the days when New York was all black Lycra and Filofaxes, for all is forgiven.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I am a ceramics and textiles specialist and currently working as a curator for a local but international gallery. I am due to retire in five years' time but find myself frustrated and limited by my surroundings. I would really like to freelance but have no idea how to market myself in such a specialised environment. How do I build up my contacts and keep the money coming in? Can you prepare to freelance while you're still in a full-time job or do you have to take the plunge and start afresh?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> The good news is that it is possible to hold on to your regular job to keep the money coming in, while following your dream to go freelance. But it will need a great deal of planning. Do not be too hasty to give up your full-time job until you have researched all your options. Freelance working is a lonely treadmill, without much financial security or social interaction. But what you gain is freedom to do the work you will enjoy without having to answer to bosses. </p> <p>However independence and freedom to select whom to work with, when and where, comes at a price. Cutting loose from the comfort zone of full-time employment, means that you are responsible for keeping your tax and national insurance contributions up to date. This is even more important in your case as you are within spitting distance of retirement. Until the venture starts to generate enough cash to support you and it looks certain to do so in the near future, it is prudent not to lose a guaranteed source of income. </p> <p>There are several useful websites that you might want to search through to see if your skills in ceramics and textiles are marketable: <a href=\"http://www.smarterwork.com\">smarterwork</a>, <a href=\"http://www.homeworkinguk.com\"> homeworkinguk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ownbase.com/\">ownbase</a>. Also your local Business Link, the government-backed help and advice service for small businesses may offer free business planning workshops. Your local <a href=\"http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/home\"> reference library </a> will have the contact details. </p> <p>You might want to check out a book aimed at people considering a freelance career, Successfully Going Freelance in a Week by Brian Holmes. The book provides a practical guide to setting up your own business, and focuses on the hard questions of motivation and suitability to take this life-changing decision. </p> <p>I am not clear about what do you mean when you say that you are a ceramics and textiles specialist. Assuming that you are a designer, you may want to contact <a href=\"http://www.creativepeople.org.uk/\">CreativePeople</a>; a national network of organisations that deliver training, professional development, advice and guidance to aspiring arts and crafts practitioners.

  "<p>Why would a parent decide to opt their children out of a normal school environment and take on teaching them at home? It's expensive and often a parent must give up a career to take on a responsibility usually left to the professionals. But, according to the scant information available, home education is on the rise. </p> <p>It's hard to establish the exact number of families opting to home educate in the UK; the existing research puts the number anywhere between 25,000 and 150,000. The widest research into the subject in the UK, a report to the then Department for Education and Employment in 1999, concluded that it is almost impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many children were educated at home. </p> <p>However, Education Otherwise, a grassroots parents' group, says it is getting 100 approaches a month from parents who are thinking about, or have started, home education. The organisation's membership has doubled in the last two years to 6,000 families. </p> <p>The reason why it's so difficult to tell how many children are at being educated at home is that nobody asks parents. Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children are educated at school or \"otherwise\" to meet their age, ability, aptitude and any special educational needs requirements. If a child is already in a state school, parents have to tell the school in writing that they are taking their child out of the system - and the school must then tell the local authority. But if a child has never been to school, or was in a private school, they don't exist to the authorities and the parents are not obliged to \"declare\" them.</p> <p>Local authorities can inspect the teaching provision, but can't force the parent to \"present\" the child. Ultimately, however, if they feel the child's educational needs aren't being met, they can take the parents to court.</p> <p>Last month, teachers called for the laws to be tightened. Why, asked the Professional Association of Teachers at its annual conference, should some of these children's standards of education and safety go unmonitored? </p> <p>Why, responded the home educating organisations, should teachers care? Surely it's a parent's right to choose what is best for their children? </p> <p>It's a familiar tale of state versus individual, where the culture of accountability in government and local authorities crashes head-on with the parents' belief that they alone are responsible for their child's welfare and education. </p> <p>Traditionally, people who choose to home educate have been seen as libertarians making a political decision to free their children from the straitjacket of a classroom. </p> <p>But the most comprehensive research on families of home educators, published in 1999 by Alan Thomas, a home education expert from the Institute of Education, showed that this stereotype was changing. </p> <p>\"People who opt to educate their children at home from the outset do not come anywhere near fitting the stereotype of the home educator: new age traveller, hothouser, religious fundamentalist or crank,\" Dr Thomas writes. \"What motivates these parents to educate their children at home, especially their concerns with the limitations of school, would strike a chord with most parents.\"</p> <p>He says that apart from the traditional \"conviction\" of home educators, more are seeing this option as their only choice. Parents may have failed to find the right school for their child, feel their child is not being stretched enough or is not getting enough help. Severe cases of bullying are also a factor. </p> <p>It's a view seen elsewhere. A national census of home educators in the US, which found a 29% boost in home educating in the last five years, reported this month that bullying and worries about standards at school were the main factors. Religion, however, is more of an issue for Americans, with 30% of home educators opting for it to provide better \"religious and moral instruction\". Only 11% of British parents in Dr Thomas' study cited religion as a factor. Fundamental to the debate in Britain is a clash of cultures about how children should be taught. Phil Hicks, a London-based representative of Education Otherwise, who has educated his three children at home, says that the authorities are not always sympathetic to different ways of learning. \"There are home educators who do it similarly to the way teachers do it in schools. There are others who do it through child-centred learning. The problem is that LEAs like the first form, but are uncomfortable with the second form. For the informal forms of home educations, they can be antagonistic because they don't understand it.\"</p> <p>The research, where it exists, is complimentary about that informal style of learning. In a 2002 report based on interviews with more than 100 families, Paula Rothermel, from the University of Durham, found that 64% of home-educated four and five-year-olds scored more than 75% in Pips baseline assessment tests, a measure of ability among primary aged children, as opposed to 5.1% of children nationally. </p> <p>The fear among home educating groups is that a more heavy-handed approach from local authorities brings with it preconceptions of what an education should be, a \"norm\", which is exactly what some parents are opting out of. </p> <p>But there's also an issue of the safety of the child. If children have absolutely no contact with the authorities, how is it possible to make sure they are safe? There is no suggestion anywhere in the research that children who are educated at home are being abused, but a system that allows some children to have no contact with schools, social services or health officials clearly leaves local authorities, with their legal responsibility to safeguard children, exposed. </p> <p>Eileen Munro, a child protection expert from the London School of Economics, says that any vulnerable children should already show up on the social services system. Alerting the authorities' suspicions to home-educated children could just create more work for an already stretched system when there's no indication that they are in danger. \"We have some real problems in the world. Why create one where one doesn't exist? Drawing attention to lots of minor problems is just clogging up the system, it will not make children safer.\"</p> <p>It's both a practical and a philosophical debate that runs to the core of the relationship between families and the government. Whose ultimate responsibility is it to educate children? And who's to say what form that education should take? </p> <p>The law clearly states that responsibility lies with the parents, and there's an element of the education establishment that is uncomfortable with that concept. But if parents are blaming the provision on offer by the state for why they chose to opt out, shouldn't the government take some responsibility too? One solution might be for all local authorities working with home educators to be trained in all kinds of teaching, or for the government to be true to its current mantra of offering \"choice\" for parents. \"You don't find many radical alternatives to traditional schools in the state system,\" says Dr Thomas. \"There's no choice really.\"</p>",

  "Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is so fed up with being grilled over his handling of the Beslan catastrophe that he lashed out at foreign journalists recently. \"Why don't you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or the White House and engage in talks?\" he demanded, adding that: \"No one has a moral right to tell us to talk to child-killers.\" <p>Fortunately for Putin, there is still one place where he is shielded from the critics: Israel. Last week Ariel Sharon welcomed the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, for a meeting about strengthening ties in the fight against terror. \"Terror has no justification, and it is time for the free, decent, humanistic world to unite and fight this terrible epidemic,\" Sharon said. </p> <p>There is little to argue with there. The essence of terrorism is the deliberate targeting of innocents to further political goals. Any claims its perpetrators make to fighting for justice are morally bankrupt, and lead directly to the barbarity of Beslan: a carefully laid plan to slaughter hundreds of children. </p> <p>Yet sympathy alone does not explain the outpourings of solidarity for Russia coming from Israeli politicians last week. An unnamed Israeli official was quoted as saying that Russians \"understand now that what they have is not a local terror problem but part of the global Islamic terror threat\". The underlying message is unequivocal: Russia and Israel are engaged in the very same war, one not against Palestinians demanding their right to statehood, or against Chechens demanding their independence, but against \"the global Islamic terror threat\". Israel, as the elder statesman, is claiming the right to set the rules of war. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the rules are the same ones Sharon uses against the intifada in the occupied territories. His starting point is that Palestinians, though they may make political demands, are actually only interested in the annihilation of Israel. This goes beyond the state's standard refusal to negotiate with terrorists - it is a conviction rooted in an insistent pathologising, not just of extremists but of the entire \"Arab mind\". </p> <p>From this basic belief several others follow. First, all Israeli violence against Palestinians is an act of self-defence, necessary to the country's survival. Second, anyone who questions Israel's absolute right to erase the enemy is themselves an enemy. This applies to the UN, other world leaders, journalists and peaceniks. </p> <p>Common wisdom has it that after 9/11 a new era of geopolitics was ushered in, defined by what is usually called the Bush doctrine: pre-emptive wars, attacks on terrorist infrastructure (read: entire countries), an insistence that all the enemy understands is force. In fact, it would be more accurate to call this rigid worldview the Likud doctrine. What happened on September 11, 2001, is that the Likud doctrine, previously targeted against Palestinians, was picked up by the most powerful nation on earth and applied on a global scale. Call it the Likudisation of the world: the real legacy of 9/11. </p> <p>On September 11 George Bush went looking for a political philosophy to guide him in his role as \"war president\". He found that philosophy in the Likud doctrine, handed to him ready-made by the ardent Likudniks ensconced in the White House. In the three years since, the Bush White House has applied this logic with chilling consistency to its global war on terror - complete with the pathologising of the \"Muslim mind\". It was the guiding philosophy in Afghanistan and Iraq, and may well extend to Iran and Syria. Bush has cast the US in the same role in which Israel casts itself, facing the same threat. In this narrative the US is fighting a never-ending battle for its survival against irrational forces that seek its total extermination. </p> <p>And now the Likudisation narrative has spread to Russia. In that same meeting with journalists, Putin made it clear he sees the drive for Chechen independence as the spearhead of a strategy by Chechen Islamists, helped by foreign fundamentalists, to undermine Russia by stirring up its Muslim population. </p> <p>There has indeed been a dramatic rise in religious fundamentalism in the Muslim world. The problem is that under the Likud doctrine we are not allowed to point out that fundamentalism breeds in failed states, where warfare has systematically targeted civilian infrastructure, allowing the mosques to start taking responsibility for everything from education to garbage collection. It has happened in Gaza, Grozny and Sadr City. </p> <p>Sharon says terrorism is an epidemic that \"has no borders, no fences\", but this is not the case. Terrorism thrives within the illegitimate borders of occupation and dictatorship; it festers behind security walls put up by imperial powers; it crosses those borders and climbs those fences to explode inside the countries responsible for, or complicit in, occupation and domination. </p> <p>If we want to see where the Likud doctrine leads, we need only go to Israel, a country paralysed by fear, embracing extrajudicial assassination and illegal settlement, and in denial about the brutality it commits daily. It is a nation surrounded by enemies and desperate for friends - a category it narrowly defines as those who ask no questions. That glimpse of our collective future is the only lesson the world needs to learn from Sharon.</p>",

  "In the current US election season, Dickie Pilager's <a href=\"http://www.dickiepilager.com/\">website</a> stands out as a model of clarity and vision. Here is the candidate standing before a view of the mountains and lakes of his native Colorado, extolling the virtues of the outdoor life. Here is the family man, praising family life and the American way. And here is the nitty-gritty of his campaign: his views on healthcare, education, gun control, abortion and the environment. <p>Like many other candidates, Dickie Pilager has learned a lesson from Howard Dean and his army of Deaniacs; his website is about involvement, providing a virtual forum for supporters to meet likeminded souls. </p> <p>But there is one aspect in which Mr Pilager is different to most of the other candidates in this election season: he is a work of fiction. </p> <p>Dickie is the lead character in Silver City, a political drama made by the veteran film director John Sayles, which is due to be released in the US today. Made with a budget of just $5.5m (about \u00a33m), the film boasts an ensemble cast of Sayles regulars, including Chris Cooper, Daryl Hannah, Richard Dreyfuss, Kris Kristofferson, Thora Birch and Tim Roth. </p> <p>While documentary makers, with Michael Moore at the forefront, have led cinema's response to the current political mood, narrative films have been slower off the mark. But Sayles has made up for lost time. The director, best known for Lone Star, Limbo and Sunshine State, was prompted to make Silver City by what he saw when filming in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. </p> <p>He told the website Comingsoon.net: \"Many people on our crew and in the community asked, what was the deal with the national media? They're not covering the real story down here, which is not these hanging chads, it's how many African-Americans did not get to vote. </p> <p>\"I've felt like our democracy was under attack from various sides, and it was important to get something out before the election.\"</p> <p>For a director renowned for the subtlety of his films, Sayles's chosen tool was decidedly blunt: satire. Silver City tells the story of the bumbling wayward son of a political dynasty, unable to think on his feet, let alone string a sentence together, who is anointed as the candidate by the business interests that run the state of Colorado. </p> <p>Played by Cooper, most recently seen in The Bourne Identity, Dickie is a dead ringer for George W Bush, from the hesitant bewilderment of his grin to his protean ability to mangle words. His campaign slogan is \"Honesty, integrity, articulacy\". </p> <p>\"We have to get our priorities straight,\" he tells an impromptu gathering of reporters in one scene. \"Education is a priority. Healthcare is a priority. Our economy is a priority. The environmental... the whole environmental arena, that's a priority, a big priority.\" </p> <p>Sayles has not denied the similarity to Bush, saying that Pilager was modelled on the political neophyte when he first ran for governor of Texas. </p> <p>But his target, he claims, is not so much Bush as the system, and his aim is to prompt voters to make the connection between the often incompetent politicians who lead them and the interests that got them elected and direct their energies. </p> <p>Sayles argues that the real villain of the piece is not the candidate but the big businessman, played by Kris Kristofferson. There is, he told National Public Radio in the US, \"a question for all of us, which is: Do we expect our candidates, do we expect our public officials... to actually be people who know anything, who can govern? Or do we expect them to just be mascots for the people who are really running things?\" </p> <p>While the film is unlikely to preach beyond its converted base - Sayles labours under the tag \"liberal film-maker\" - Fahrenheit 9/11 has shown that the impact of a film can be considerable in such a hard-fought election. Already Silver City has attracted the opprobrium of one bastion of conservatism, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Network, which named it - along with Michael Moore's film and the environmental disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow - Hollywood's contribution to the John Kerry campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 has signed an \u20ac80m (\u00a354.7m) digital transmission deal that allows it to launch a range of new channels as broadcasters position themselves for the anticipated switch-off of the analogue television signal in 2012. </p> <p>The 10-year contract is the third deal this week between British broadcasters and Luxembourg-based SES Global, the satellite company that provides the backbone for BSkyB's Sky Digital. Freeview is the fastest growing digital TV service, but Sky Digital is the largest with 7.4 million subscribers. It will expand shortly with the launch of FreeSat, its version of Freeview. </p> <p>ITV and cable operator NTL have also signed deals with SES to beam more services into digital TV homes, a market that is growing, with 55% of the nation's TV households already digitised through satellite, cable or Freeview. </p> <p>Channel 4 is hiring space on the Astra 2D satellite for about 14 channels, though the number will depend on the use of interactive services, which can demand nearly as much capacity as a broadcast channel. The government-owned channel has no immediate plans to launch new ventures on 2D, but the satellite is running out of capacity and the broadcaster booked the space as an insurance policy. </p> <p>David Scott, the deputy chief executive of Channel 4, said the deal \"will provide Channel 4 with considerable flexibility when considering the expansion and future development of our broadcast services\". </p> <p>The 2D satellite is attractive to broadcasters who want to appear on the digital satellite platform but want to avoid paying BSkyB for encryption that stops film and sports broadcasts spilling into mainland Europe, thereby breaking rights agreements. </p> <p>The 2D satellite has a broadcasting \"footprint\" that fits Britain and threatens less overspill. This inspired the BBC to book space on 2D last year as part of a plan to abandon its multimillion-pound encryption deal with BSkyB. Channel 4's encryption deal with BSkyB expires in 2008, and its executives are exploring the possibility of broadcasting unencrypted on 2D. </p> <p>ITV will launch its archive channel, ITV3, in November and is planning a time-delayed version of ITV1, but ITV insiders said the SES deal would not herald an explosion of digital channels. ITV will use the new capacity to broadcast more regional services on the Sky Digital platform, and to add more interactive services to existing channels. </p> <p>ITV executives believe they are \"future proofing\" the broadcaster for increased competition in the multichannel world and want extra capacity on standby if they need to launch new services. </p> <p>The NTL deal is with the cable group's broadcast division, which now offers space on the BSkyB platform to channels seeking a berth on Sky Digital.</p>",
  "<p>Last year VSO, the international development charity, published a position paper on how its work in ELT can contribute to its wider strategy on tackling poverty and empowering disadvantaged people in some of the poorest communities in the world. As a result VSO's ELT work is concentrating on areas where disadvantage is most severe and widespread, rather than more developed countries that are able to invest in an education system.</p> <p>VSO works in almost 40 countries and supports ELT in 21 of them, including Cambodia, China, Namibia and Vietnam. The paper sets out a policy that ensures VSO will look at how the widespread growth of English language skills can contribute to improving long-term economic, cultural and political development when assessing its work in a country.</p> <p>The charity is striving to improve English teaching where it has been relatively inaccessible rather than boosting English teaching for more educated groups. The charity also examines a variety of other factors to determine whether a country's development would benefit from ELT support. These include whether English is an official language, needed to enter secondary or post-secondary education or vital to gain work because it is widely used in certain fields, such as tourism and business.</p> <p>Having identified the areas it will work in, VSO is also developing the way in which its volunteers are working and the types of teacher it needs to recruit. The average age of a volunteer is 38, and increasingly volunteers are moving away from straight classroom teaching and focusing on training teachers, improving teaching methodology and influencing education policy in developing countries throughout the world. </p> <p>Much of VSO's philosophy is based on the ever-growing ripple effect, whereby through working in partnership with colleagues and sharing skills a volunteer's work has a more long-term and sustainable impact. This is illustrated by the work of volunteers in China where, at any one time, more than 120 professionals are helping to train 12,000 Chinese schoolteachers. These teachers will go on to educate more than a million students each year. This far-reaching framework is much more effective than a volunteer teaching English to one class before heading home.</p> <p>The result is that VSO is looking to recruit more mature and experienced volunteer teachers, who have the experience needed to work in an education management or teacher training. These professionals will share their expertise with educational organisations and governments to establish teacher-training programmes and offer advice on ELT curriculum development.</p> <p>Former ELT volunteer Frances Platt, 53, had been teaching Italian at Leeds University in England for five years when she decided to apply to VSO. Based in Banepa, Nepal, Platt's placement focused on improving teaching methodology and encouraging colleagues to move away from traditional rote learning to student-centred activities, which are more effective at engaging pupils.</p> <p>Platt visited rural schools, working alongside colleagues to develop their lesson style, encouraging the use of resources such as games and pictures, rather than \"chalk and talk\" teaching. \"Teaching using simple picture and language games was a revelation. Suddenly lessons had a fun element. Personally, I felt incredibly privileged to live and work in such a different culture,\" says Platt.</p> <p>For many volunteers VSO offers a valuable professional development opportunity. While working abroad they often hold positions of greater responsibility than at home and they gain experience of a wide variety of roles. They gain greater proficiency in policy making, management and training, a wider range of teaching styles, an enhanced awareness of global issues and better team-working skills.</p> <p>Platt's experience of working in another country has improved her understanding of other cultures, and this has helped her since she returned to Britain and started teaching English to asylum seekers at a college in West Yorkshire. \"I feel I can offer them more as I can empathise with how they see our culture,\" she says.</p> <p>Andrew Morris volunteered for VSO's ELT programmes in China and Eritrea and his experiences have also contributed to his career development.

  "<p>In this its 70th year, the British Council cannot afford to look like a venerable institution. While it is independent of government control, it relies on government largesse for close to a third of its $873m annual budget - the rest is generated through its own commercial teaching activities and other consultancy work - so it must prove that its work is relevant in a changing world.</p> <p>The council's core role, as defined in 1940 when it received its Royal Charter, is to promote knowledge about Britain abroad, to develop stronger cultural ties with the rest of the world and to promote knowledge of English.</p> <p>Responsibility for keeping this English teaching role relevant falls, in large part, to John Whitehead. Aged 52 and a council staff member since 1990, he became director of the English Language Teaching group last November. Since then he has been a key player in producing the council's latest five-year plan - Strategy 2010 - launched earlier this year. </p> <p>For council watchers, Strategy 2010 says little new about what the council is trying to achieve - the original charter objectives are now expressed as \"building mutually beneficial relationships between people in the UK and other countries\". The emphasis is on doing this task more efficiently. But the presentation of its work has shifted, with the promotion of British education - courses, skills and products - brought centre stage. </p> <p>Whereas over the last decade the council has highlighted Britain as a dynamic cultural partner for the rest of the world - remember \"cool Britannia\" - and an inspiration to fledgling democracies seeking British \"governance\" skills, over the next five years it is a world hungry for education that will find Britain, and the council, ready to serve.</p> <p>This focus on education is also the product of astute lobbying. Earlier this year the council produced new research with a chilling message: the UK economy could lose up to $7bn a year by 2020 to its competitors if there wasn't immediate investment in international education. And with the government determined to boost numbers of fee-paying foreign students coming to British universities, it was not surprising that the council was rewarded with a 12% increase in its grant (worth $354m by 2008) to help it protect Britain's market share.</p> <p>But how will this shift in emphasis change the council's work in ELT and the way EL learners around the world interact with it? Given that Whitehead leads a team of only 20 people, the answer, he says, lies in stretching his limited resources by mediating better between providers of ELT skills and learners.</p> <p>He also believes that English plays a key role in achieving the council's wider 2010 objectives, but at the same time he is clear that this should not be led by the desire to simply sell British ELT products.</p> <p>\"We are here to help countries develop the capacity of learning and teaching English for their own means, to meet their own agendas,\" he says, citing Iraq as one recent example. The council doesn't have the resources to rebuild schools there (the Iraqi administration's primary request), Whitehead says, but it does have the contacts and expertise to make the most effective use of UK skills providers to achieve Iraq's aim: \"to re-establish English as a major means of accessing the world outside Iraq and becoming part of the international community again.\"</p> <p>The council deserves its reputation for global ELT \"crisis management\" - skills it has honed since the early 1990s when the post-communist countries of Eastern Europe dumped Russian as their second language in education and embraced English. But away from \"transitional\" states with remedial work to be done, the future of the council's ELT presence and role is less clear. It is facing growing competition from other skills providers, while more countries have the capacity to teach English effectively with little outside help.</p> <p>India is a key example. Under the council's previous five-year strategy it was identified as one of the world regions where the council's presence and reach would expand, not in face-to-face teaching, but via the internet. That process is unrolling with a significant share of Whitehead's resources being spent on developing web-based services targeted at India's wealthy middle classes, along side existing teaching centres - what is called its \"blended approach\". </p> <p>But the sudden and largely unpredicted boom in the call-centre industry could put the council in a difficult position. Many of those would-be call-centre workers want traditional face-to-face tuition to improve their English, and foreign ELT providers from international chain schools to national providers like Ausralia's IDP have been rushing in to open schools.</p> <p>Whitehead is sanguine about the way the Indian market is developing, and while he does not have direct responsiblity for the council's 110 commercial teaching centres worldwide, he says that there are no plans to expand capacity in India. \"We don't teach English in teaching centres or run exams to make money. We do it because, like all our other activities, it helps us to achieve our objectives. Otherwise we would just be a language school. Experience shows us that if you go over a certain size, quality is called into question. We are only interested in maintaining and improving the standard of service we deliver to people: we're not in the business of bums of seats.\"</p> <p>But a new way of working for the council will be in collaboration with commercial sponsors. A leading partner so far has been HSBC bank - it has funded the council to carry out EL teacher training in Lebanon and the council has been training HSBC's call centre staff in Sri Lanka. </p> <p>The next phase of the strategy for Whitehead will be to unroll a new internal structure. The world has been divided up into 13 regions and he is introducing a centralised commissioning system that will avoid widely dispersed staff duplicating work. </p> <p>For Whitehead, the council doesn't need to \"reinvent the wheel\" every time it gets a request for help. It is in the business of tweaking what has already proved effective.</p>",
  "<p>The debate about whether learners of English as a foreign language should be taught a standard English or an international English has neglected a number of important issues. </p> <p>First, it's not what's taught that really matters; it's what's learned that counts. And one thing we know about language learning is that learners don't learn what teachers teach. They learn both more and less than they are taught; they learn what they want to learn from what is available to them. And what is available to them is much more than what they are taught; it's also the language they are exposed to, the language they produce themselves, the paralinguistic expressions of the people they interact with, the whole context of the learning environment inside the classroom and outside in the real world, both during and after a course.</p> <p>Millions of people around the world have failed to learn standard Englishes successfully because they were not effectively engaged in the learning process. English was remote, they lost self-esteem, they were negative towards a learning process that diminished them and didn't ask them to do what they really wanted to do. They might even have worked hard but they didn't learn English because they didn't really want to learn what was available to them.</p> <p>One of the factors in their failure might have been that an irrelevant and unattainable variety of English was being imposed on them. But the same thing could happen with the teaching of English as an international language (EIL). Unless the learners feel respected and enhanced, unless they are given achievable challenges, unless they are effectively and cognitively engaged in the learning process, unless what they really want to learn and do is made available to them, they will fail to learn successfully. If a variety of international language is made available to learners, it must be a rich variety not a reduced and impoverished variety - and the experience of learning it must be rich and positive too.</p> <p>A second neglected issue relates to the question of who knows best. Jennifer Jenkins, in her article \"Beware the natives and their norms (January 22) quite rightly objects to the privileged dominance of native speaker teachers of EFL and complains that \"'nativeness', it seems is all.\" </p> <p>Ironically, so far the main proponents of teaching a variety of international English have been native speaker (or at least native speaker like) applied linguists. Not many are teachers and not many are users of English as a foreign language. They have provided expert insights into the characteristics and exponents of international English and are conducting the rigorous research that will soon provide us with very useful objective descriptions of the Englishes used in international communication. But the danger is that an expert syllabus could be imposed on learners without any input from them and without a methodology to bring it to useful life.</p> <p>Another issue relates to the question of whether research should focus on what non-native speakers typically do when interacting with each other or whether it should be restricted to what proficient non-native speakers do when achieving successful communication with each other. One answer to this question would be that it would be extremely useful to know both what typically causes mis-communication between non-native speakers and what typically facilitates successful communication between them.</p> <p>The main question is, of course, \"What do non-native speakers want?\". They need to decide what varieties of English they want to learn; what they want to be able to do in English; what they don't want to be able to do in English; how they want to learn English; how they don't want to learn English; what type of materials they want to use; what type of materials they don't want to use; how they want to be assessed and how they don't want to be assessed.</p> <p>But then am I, as a native speaker, being arrogant in asserting this? Isn't the logical conclusion of my position that it is non-native learners of English who need to decide what it is that they need to decide? Whatever the answer to the question is, I think applied linguists can make a very positive contribution by describing and clarifying the options in order to help learners to learn for themselves.<br></p> <p><strong>What ELT needs</strong><br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Even greater efforts to be made by researchers to construct corpora of international English that provide us with reliable information about what non-native speakers of English do with English, how they do it both unsuccessfully and successfully, and what they use when doing it unsuccessfully and successfully<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> descriptions to be developed from these corpora of the commonalities of both unsuccessful and successful communication in English between non-native speakers<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> syllabuses to be developed that make use of these descriptions but do not restrict their contents to them<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Methodologies to be developed to maximise the learning opportunities that can be provided by these syllabuses<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> materials to be developed that provide learners with a choice of targets, exponents, activities and texts (eg a choice between listening and reading texts that feature native speaker communication and texts that feature successful non-native speaker communication)<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> examinations to be developed that do not demand a standard unattainable by many native speakers but do offer candidates options offering choices of targets and capabilities.<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Brian Tomlinson is reader in language learning and teaching at Leeds Metropolitan University, England: b.tomlinson@leedsmet.ac.uk<br> The university is launching a new MA in teaching English as an international language in September 2005, which will be staffed by a team of mainly non-native speaker lecturers who will help a cohort of mainly non-native speaker students to decide for themselves what and how to teach<br></p>",
  "Prime ministers make environment speeches about every two years. Invariably they make platitudinous statements about how important nature is for today's quality of life and tomorrow's generations. On Tuesday Tony Blair took the now orthodox line - just as he did in 2000 and 2002 - that climate change is happening as a result of human behaviour, and that disaster looms if nothing is done to avert it. <p>This green speech was the most anxious of the three Mr Blair has made in office, mixing evidence of the growing number of extreme climatic events with estimates of the escalating costs of dealing with more frequent and intense heat waves, floods and storms. The overriding positive, he said, was that \"with the political and collective will\", climate change could be addressed. </p> <p>But for all the green rhetoric, there's little evidence yet that this government - or any other - has the political will to address what is now accepted as a potentially overwhelming global problem. </p> <p>Britain sees itself as the world leader in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and aims, ambitiously, to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60% from their 1990 levels by 2050. But the government glosses over the fact that we are on track to miss by a mile our commitment to reduce emissions by 20% by 2010. </p> <p>The evidence comes from Cambridge Econometrics, the leading independent trackers and forecasters of UK greenhouse gas emissions. In a study published in July, they said we would easily meet the far lower targets required under the still unratified Kyoto agreement. </p> <p>Emissions from power generation, said the authors, are likely to drop by 5.5%, largely because of the investment in wind power, but those from domestic and transport sources are rising steeply, undermining the push to renewables. Emissions from road transport will, by 2010, rise by 14% from 1990 levels. </p> <p>The problem, agreed other political parties and most environment groups this week, is that the government is pursuing two opposite agendas. Even as green Labour urges business and consumers to invest in renewables and use less power, grey Labour is quietly engineering some of the greatest expansions seen in road and air transport in decades. The result is that emissions are rising and little real environmental progress is possible. </p> <p>The responsibility for domestic energy conservation, point out the greens, has been passed to cash-starved local authorities; the government has presided over a 17% increase in road traffic; reduced its support for renewables; and is well short of its target to spend a meagre \u00a320m on solar roofs. Meanwhile, it is subsidising by \u00a3500m the new Airbus - 13 times the total amount pledged for all non-nuclear renewables in 2002. It may have encouraged a massive increase in wind power, but the consensus is that it is not getting to grips with energy conservation, nor is it pushing strongly enough for alternatives like marine power. </p> <p>Last month, the environmental audit committee of the Commons agreed. Its report on energy and climate change said the government's energy strategy was now \"seriously off course\" and that \"more imaginative and radical\" policies were needed for transport. Transport's share of UK emissions, it says, will rise from 18.7% in 1990 to an expected 26.3% in 2010. Air transport's has almost doubled between 1990 and 2002, moving groups like Transport 2000 to accuse the government of being \"in denial\". </p> <p>But Mr Blair, encouraged by the Foreign Office, which has long seen the diplomatic benefit of Britain being a global environmental leader, has his sights on getting the world to change its energy habits. Next year, he said on Tuesday, Britain will use its presidency of the EU and the G8 to push for international climate change action. </p> <p>This is optimistic, if much needed. Far from being the environmental paragon it likes to suggest it is, Europe is on course to fail to meet even its low Kyoto target of 5.2% cuts in emissions on 1990 figures by 2012. According to the European Environment Agency, overall emissions are only 2.1% lower than in 1990. Only France, Germany, Sweden and the UK are likely to meet their targets and Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Denmark and Greece are all expected to overshoot - some substantially. Most OECD countries have the same problems as Britain: carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles in Europe will rise by 30% by 2010, says the agency. </p> <p>Mr Blair, who is pinning his hopes on the emergence of an international trading market in emissions and better technology, will have an even more uphill struggle to persuade countries outside Europe to cut emissions. George Bush reportedly now accepts the evidence that climate change is happening, but his administration is implacably opposed to the Kyoto process which involves only rich countries cutting back emissions. Meanwhile, John Kerry is coy about committing the US to cuts. </p> <p>Russia is the wild card on which the Kyoto process depends. But it is preocccupied and quite likely to kill off the international treaty - which took more than 10 years to negotiate - by delaying its decision to the point where it is too late for countries to adopt in time to cut emissions. </p> <p>The government will soon review its climate change strategy, and can be expected to come up with some eye-catching solar and alternative energy plans. But until it gets to grips with transport, it will continue to be running with the hares and riding with the hounds. Which mostly ends in disaster. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Vidal is the Guardian's environment editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.vidal@theguardian.com\">john.vidal@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs yesterday announced \"changes to the licensing system\" for the control of the cormorant population. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation welcomed the decision, describing it as a significant increase in \"species management\". What these weasel words mean is that people with licences will now be empowered to shoot up to 3,000 of these birds instead of the current limit of 300. With Defra's deft timing this was announced the day after the House of Commons had voted for a ban on hunting with dogs. Unlike foxhunting, the decision needs no legislative approval, though the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds may challenge this claim in the courts. <p>In theory, this could create a timely opportunity for hunters to fill the void in their lives by shooting cormorants instead of chasing foxes - and staying this side of the legal divide. But life is not so simple. For a start, the hunters would have to get off their high horses. What it does illustrate is the thin line in species management separating hunting (bad) from culling (bad but environmentally necessary). Whatever happens to hunting with dogs, foxes will continue to be culled in other ways. Cormorants, for their part, have committed no offence other than to have expanded in numbers (after facing near-extinction) and to have moved inland to indulge their ravenous fish-eating in our ever cleaner rivers. </p> <p>Technology might offer a solution here. It would be relatively simple to devise a computer game in which real foxes in the fields might have global positioning microchips embedded in them as part of a multi-player game in which thousands of people around the world chase them with packs of virtual dogs on their computer screens. Participants would get all the thrill of the chase without a real fox being killed. In this way hunting could escape the wrath of the anti-blood sports lobbies. The trouble is that it would trigger an equally violent reaction from the anti-video violence lobbies. We always knew there was no simple solution to this problem.</p>",
  "<p>Pressure on French advertising group Havas mounted yesterday as it emerged that corporate raider and dissident shareholder Vincent Bollore has asked for seats on the company's board. </p> <p>The revelation follows Mr Bollore's decision to raise his stake in Havas to 10.4%, which added to speculation that the world's sixth biggest advertising group could soon be sold after it lost out in the bidding for Grey Global. </p> <p>\"We are looking at this. We are reflecting about putting representatives on the board,\" the Havas chairman and chief executive, Alain de Pouzilhac, told a news conference yesterday. </p> <p>\"It seems legitimate to me that this shareholder is asking to be represented.\" </p> <p>He described Mr Bollore, who opposed Havas's decision to bid for Grey, as an \"anchor point\" and welcomed his involvement in the company. </p> <p>Havas failed in its quest for Grey when the American group was sold to Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP this week. </p> <p>After winning the Grey auction, Sir Martin warned Havas it could get left behind as the industry consolidates, with WPP, Omnicom, Interpublic and Publicis dominating the sector. </p> <p>He refused to rule out bidding for the French company, though conceded it was \"probably wrong for us to focus on Havas\". </p> <p>Mr de Pouzilhac said the company, which is home to the Euro RSCG network, had the resources to develop on its own. \"We have the talents and fundamentals that permit Havas to continue its development alone.\" </p> <p>The group said it had improved profits in the first half of the year after restructuring and announced plans for a rights issue to raise funds. </p> <p>Havas's net profit in the first half of 2004 was \u00a39.5m, against a net loss of \u00a339m a year earlier when the company was hit by writedowns. But revenues were down 10% to \u00a3510m. Net debt rose to \u00a3544m from \u00a3486m.</p>",
  "<p>Any film critic who claims to discover a central theme at an international film festival is probably lying. By nature, these sprawling hyperbolic events are all about covering the territory. Film festivals are not museums, putting narrow or in-depth collections on display. Rather, they tend to churn up the water in the hope that their catch will be broad enough to sell tickets, make distribution deals, satisfy donors, and garner maximum press coverage. </p> <p>The Toronto International film festival is no exception to this rule; indeed, with over 300 films on offer and a team of programmers savvy about genre and geography, it's particularly catholic in its approach. What has made Toronto unique among an elite cohort of international festivals is the central role of the audience. Ordinary Torontonians go to the movies, react, and shape the out-of-town professionals' idea of what might be possible in the future of cinema. </p> <p>Take the example of My Summer of Love, Pawel Pawlikowski's charming tale of the love and disillusion that affect a pair of teenage girls of different classes over the course of a Yorkshire summer. Sure, the film just won the Michael Powell prize at Edinburgh. But jury awards are widely regarded as irrelevant to box-office or real-world appeal. Fast forward to Toronto, where My Summer of Love just unspooled in a multiplex. The audience went crazy for it and, fuelled by this evidence of public enthusiasm, Focus Films paid a rumoured $2m for the US rights. Take that as a simple example of the vertical integration on offer at Toronto, where a film's entire life - from first hot-house premiere to eventual popcorn consumption - can seem to flash by with the kind of intensity that even festivals rarely provide. </p> <p>Another function of festivals, and Toronto is no exception in drawing us all here with its promise, is the anticipation of uncovering new talent previously uncelebrated. Critics live for this, the genuine hitting of paydirt in the midst of what can easily become a cynical process. That flash of gold in the prospecting pan can redeem a whole festival for me. And, as always, Toronto has delivered. It took five whole days, but then, there it was: the world premiere of On the Outs, a gritty drama about adolescent girls in Jersey City with dead-end lives who make bad decisions that turn their prospects even worse. A first dramatic feature by young documentarians Lori Silverbush and Michael Skolnik, it makes the telling of complex stories look deceptively simple. It broke my heart. </p> <p>Festivals are like the weather channel on cable TV, too: the place where you can always watch storm clouds gathering and digital satellite models sweep across a continent. In this case, it's about watching reputations, rather than barometers, go up and down. Yes, Toronto offers great spectator sport in this, too. I still remember the year that Gus Van Sant came to town with Even Cowgirls Get the Blues: he arrived a hero, then practically had to sneak out of town after its world premiere. (I remain the only critic in existence who liked it.) This week, I've been thrilled to witness the opposite: three film-makers who've just jumped light years ahead of their previous skill set. </p> <p>If this were a longer piece or if this were a trade journal, I'd detour here into a long rambling list of the more mainstream films, with a sidebar on what everybody wore on the red carpet. Nope, that won't happen. But perhaps I can mention that both Alexander Payne's Sideways and David O Russell's I Heart Huckabees are larger-than-life movies that deliver, with exuberance, a delight way beyond the early promise of their makers. Audiences emerged euphoric. Both are examples of how the Hollywood and indie worlds are converging, with their styles cross-mutating into a new hybrid that cannot be filed away conveniently in either category drawer. Quirky and sassy, they are the bastard children of an imaginary merger, a shotgun marriage between wit and entertainment, sophistication and populism. They are brain food for the malnourished viewer. (So perhaps you will forgive me for forsaking my alleged duty: I decided that, no, I would not bother to see the latest Todd Solondz film, Palindromes, which is certain to continue his inexplicably successful ruse of using shock tactics to inflict an increasingly predictable contempt upon his actors, his characters, and his audiences.) </p> <p>In the end, I'm a member of that doomed breed, the film critic, and so despite a solemn vow, I can't resist the doomed challenge of looking for a theme. Call it the 9/12 cinema, then, because that's the day it started. Serious documentaries meant to affect the US election are sharing space in the Toronto schedule with serious dramatic films culled from headlines and history books, based on true events and actual figures, invested with cinematic values. </p> <p>Failure of imagination? No, I'd wager it's a reaction to the past three years in which fiction got thoroughly beaten out by world events. Films are tired of being upstaged by breaking news. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Films have finally begun to catch up with television and to bring the world more fully onscreen. The wars on Iraq and Afghanistan and the upcoming US election have sparked a series of documentaries, while the consequent global destabilisation is inspiring fiction films in all corners of the world. </p> <p>In Toronto, these new tendencies were on prominent display in a wide range of work from many different countries. It's a surprising development to witness at a festival that prides itself simply on talent and aesthetics and, oh yes, box office. Film-makers are rising to the challenge of a global dialogue. Never has access to the subjectivities of other people and nations been more important. Never has a Toronto International film festival been so very inspiring.</p>"
