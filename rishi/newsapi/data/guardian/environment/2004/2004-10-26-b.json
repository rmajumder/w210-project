  "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso had thought he would be presenting a dream team to the European parliament today. Instead he is embroiled in a nightmare row over politics and morality in a power struggle that has injected rare passion and drama into an EU debate - and might, just, end up bringing ordinary people a little closer to the distant institutions that represent them. <p>It was not clear last night whether, or how, the fight over Rocco Buttiglione, Italy's controversial candidate for the Brussels executive - the commissioner-designate for justice and home affairs - can be resolved after a marathon bout of horsetrading in the Strasbourg assembly. If it is not, then many MEPs will be cock-a-hoop. But it will be at the cost of plunging the EU into a grave and unprecedented crisis. </p> <p>In any event, this is the worst start for Barroso, Maoist revolutionary turned centre-right Portuguese prime minister, taking over the presidency from the lacklustre Romano Prodi just as the EU adjusts to the reality of having 25 members and 450 million people - and is about to start years of difficult accession talks with Turkey. </p> <p>On Friday, heads of government gather in Rome for a ceremony to sign the new constitutional treaty. This is designed to make the union function more efficiently and democratically. But with referendums looming in several countries, including Britain, and apathy and Euroscepticism as bad as ever, it may never take effect. And then next week the EU will have to come to terms with the result of the US presidential election, with many leaders rooting privately for John Kerry, and thus risking exaggerated expectations of a man who may speak French and like working with allies, but will probably be unable to deliver a significantly better relationship between the old and new continents. Europe, so often trapped in the gap between aspiration and reality, does not seem poised to play a bigger, more coherent role in the world stage. </p> <p>That global role, though, must begin at home, and Buttiglione is not the only joker in the commission pack: MEPs also raised objections to the Dutch businesswoman appointed to take over the competition portfolio, the Hungarian unsuited to managing energy and the Danish agriculture commissioner married to a farmer enriched by CAP subsidies. </p> <p>None of these candidates generated much interest beyond the Brussels beltway. But the Italian conservative and friend of the Pope has raised hackles because of his views on homosexuality, single mothers and the family - classic beliefs of the conservative Catholic that he is. Feelings ran just as high during negotiations on the EU constitution, with the Italian, Polish and Irish governments - backed by the Vatican - demanding a clear reference to Christian values, but being defeated by the secular-minded majority which decided, correctly, that this would be the wrong message to send to Europe's multicultural societies - with 12 million Muslims, as well as those Turkish wannabes. </p> <p>Buttiglione was justified in arguing that there is a difference between law and morality, and he is entitled to his private views. But he showed a breathtaking lack of judgment in answering MEPs' questions the way he did. The row escalated when his supporters protested about an anti-Catholic \"inquisition\". Yet there is no such inquisition. Joe Borg, the Maltese commission candidate, is a staunch opponent of abortion, but that is irrelevant to his duties running fisheries policy. It is understandable that Barroso did not wish to cede too much ground to parliament. But he was foolish to reject a reshuffle that could have ended this fight quickly and simply. </p> <p>Some of this is the inevitable outcome of the sheer com plexity of the EU's hybrid, Heath Robinson structures. Buttiglione was nominated by Silvio Berlusconi just as Peter Mandelson was by Tony Blair, for similar reasons of domestic politics and the desire to set the policy agenda. The appointed commission president then has to find jobs for these national nominees - who must all pass muster in today's all-or-nothing vote by MEPs. </p> <p>It is a good idea for the European parliament to have a bigger say in the make-up of the union's supranational executive (those \"Brussels bureaucrats\" beloved of British newspapers) and disingenuous to say it should not have one because of poor turnout - a dismal 44% last June - in the European elections. Most people know little about an institution routinely scorned as a talking shop on a gravy train - though some may remember the jaw-dropping gaffe last year when Berlusconi compared a German MEP to a Nazi camp guard. Extraordinary misjudgments and a vicious skirmish over institutional power have come together to create a moment where the stakes for Europe's disenchanted union of states and peoples are suddenly very high. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Ian Black left Brussels this summer after four years as the Guardian's European editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Lords last night threw down another hunting gauntlet before the equally implacable Commons when peers voted by 322 to 72 to restore the \"third way\" compromise that would allow hunting with hounds under local licence. <p>During yet another indignant debate on the most disruptive social issue of the current parliament, the junior environment minister, Lord Whitty, faced repeated demands to explain the government's position. </p> <p>Although the bill is a private backbench one, Lord Whitty was asked to confirm if the \"draconian\" Parliament Act would be used to push it through to law. This is what MPs and peers expect, not least because last night's amendment was subtly different from the third-way clause proposed by Alun Michael, the countryside minister, before the Commons voted it down. \"There are loads of loopholes, including deer hunting,\" one anti-hunting Labour peer claimed last night. </p> <p>But both sides are anxious that the other should be blamed for unreasonable tactics. MPs say they have voted many times for an outright ban and have public opinion behind them. </p> <p>Tony Blair's spokesman confirmed that the prime minister personally backed a third way compromise but that his MPs had overruled him. \"Let us wait and see what the ... Lords does, but the prime minister has not changed his view at any point that it would be better if a compromise is agreed.\" </p> <p>Pro-hunting peers and MPs in all parties insisted that the government was abusing its power, in order to attack a traditional country pursuit for narrow party gain - based on class warfare and Mr Blair's urgent need to appease his own backbenches after being weakened over Iraq. </p> <p>They believe there must be a compromise that will keep hunting with dogs in some form and save the government from the kind of militant tactics, in an election campaign, that saw pro-hunters this September invade the floor of the Commons. </p> <p>They also think hunting is the least cruel way of culling foxes compared with gassing or shooting - a claim which enrages their opponents. </p> <p>Lord Whitty showed no sign of blinking in what has become a parliamentary poker game. He insisted it was up to the Lords to present \"a proposition which is likely to engage the majority in the House of Commons\". He added: \"If not, it is you who are putting us on course for the potential deadlock and therefore potential use of the Parliament Act.\" </p> <p>Lord Donoughue, a veteran Labour peer, emerged at the forefront of the pro-hunting lobby. He said that if the government \"does not accept this rational compromise, and also uses the draconian Parliament Act against its original proposals, then my government ... will ... be shamed and humiliated by its actions.\" </p> <p>Lord King of Bridgwater, a former defence secretary, said: \"It is ministers and the government who will have to pick up the mess if this goes through in a way that ministers have already admitted is unworkable and which could lead to serious tensions in this country.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair knows his MPs are fed up with waiting seven years to get a ban and that he will almost certainly have to use the Parliament Act - the act that allows a manifesto-pledged bill to be pushed through against Lords opposition after it has been rejected by peers in two successive sessions. The power dates from the Lloyd George budget crisis of 1911, but has rarely been used. Nowadays the issue is complicated by the European charter of human rights which pro-hunters will try to deploy. </p> <p><b>Battle lines</b></p> <p><b>A complete ban - chances 7/10</b><br> Labour MPs are in no mood to accept a compromise even if offered one. When the legislation returns to the Commons next month they are all but certain to vote once again to stop all hunting with dogs. This paves the way for the Parliament Act to be used and a ban becoming law. Any other result would be a surprise. </p> <p><b>A partial ban - chances 2/10</b><br> The prime minister still backs middle way proposals, banning some forms of hunting. Many pro-hunt campaigners are now prepared to accept this compromise. MPs have already rejected this option. </p> <p><b>No change - chances 1/10</b><br> Both houses seem to accept that the law should change - the question now is how. The bill could still fail if parliament runs out of time, or if a legal challenge blocks the use of the Parliament Act.</p>",
  "<b> Times</b> <br> Editorial, October 26 <p> \"It is ... bizarre that the government should now be preparing to drop its veto on asylum and immigration issues within the EU with barely any explanation and little attempt to forestall the outcry that Britain is surrendering sovereignty on an issue of crucial social and political importance ... </p> <p>\"Labour obviously fears that any talk of majority voting on asylum will be seized on by the Conservatives as a surrender to 'Europe', stoking anti-EU feeling.

  "<p>The government will try to improve competition in the European telecoms market when it takes over the European Union presidency next July. </p> <p>A handful of EU states have yet to implement directives covering telecoms and the government believes the current regulatory patchwork is hindering competition. </p> <p>E-commerce minister Mike O'Brien, who took up his post last month, told delegates at an industry conference in central London yesterday that while the regulatory environment in the UK had led to increased competition, the picture across the rest of the EU was not so rosy. \"I do not think we can create unified regulation,\" he told the European Telecoms Conference organised by Economist Conferences. \"What we can do is get a level of regulation which is broadly consistent\". </p> <p>He said British companies seeking to break into Europe were being constrained by inconsistent regulation. Four years ago the commission released a series of directives covering all aspects of the telecoms markets and called on regulators in members states to carry out reviews of the market. </p> <p>Four countries - Belgium, Estonia, Greece and Luxembourg - have yet to implement the directives. Estonia, as one of the ten new accession countries, was given until July this year to comply. </p> <p>No member state's regulator has carried out all the market reviews required by the directives but in Britain Ofcom is ahead of the pack with all but two of its re views under way or completed. Mr O'Brien said the government would use its EU presidency to \"put some pressure on to see if we can get the broad-based European structure accepted by all countries.\" </p> <p>The government is not calling for more regulation, but a consistent application of the existing regime.</p>",
  "<p>Roman Abramovich, the Russian billionaire, has completed his exit from the Russian aluminium giant RusAl by selling his remaining 25% stake to fellow oligarch Oleg Deripaska for a reported $2bn (\u00a31.1bn). </p> <p>Basic Element, the company that Mr Deripaska controls, said \"negotiations over the acquisition of 25% of the shares of Russian Aluminium have been completed\". It said the purchase had been made from the main shareholders of Rusal and that Basic Element now owned 100% of the shares in RusAl. </p> <p>Russian Aluminium is based in Moscow. It accounts for three-quarters of Russia's primary aluminium production and a tenth of global output. </p> <p>Mr Abramovich, who was last year thought to be the next Russian oligarch in the Kremlin's sights, has been slowly moving to sell off some of his assets in Russia. In September he sold a 25% stake in RusAl for a reported $3bn, fuelling rumours of his imminent departure to live in London, where he owns Chelsea FC. </p> <p>A source close to Mr Abramovich dismissed speculation that he was shifting his assets out of Russia in the wake of the Kremlin's high-profile pursuit of oil giant Yukos and its billionaire owner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. </p> <p>Mr Abramovich has also come under state scrutiny over his governorship of the remote far eastern region of Chukotka but his term of office expires this year.</p>",
  "<p>When Wistow mine, the first of the five in the Selby coalfield, began producing coal in 1983, it was a mine that people from all over the world came to see: this was the first new British coalfield for half a century, the biggest pit in Europe. Tucked away on a quiet country road in Yorkshire, screened by hundreds of young trees, its winding gear encased in mellow York stone, it didn't look like other pits. But by the end of that decade and well into the 90s, Wistow was smashing production records. It seemed to confirm the early confidence of the coal industry that this would be a \"job for life\", with reserves that would last well into the 21st century, as Derek Ezra, chairman of the National Coal Board had stated: \"The superb reserves of Selby are going to play a vital part in Britain's industrial regeneration.\" </p> <p>Now Wistow is deserted. A notice reads, \"Welcome to Wistow. This mine is environmentally friendly - keep it clean to keep it green,\" but the last coal was mined back in May. The only sound is wind rustling the leaves of the trees, the occasional twittering of birds. From here, as from all points in this flat, verdant landscape below York, the eye is drawn south to the cooling towers of Eggborough power station, peacefully puffing out clouds of steam, once the destination for the coal and a poignant reminder of what this was all for. </p> <p>Blaming financial losses and deteriorating geological conditions, UK Coal has carried through the closures it began upon taking over in 1995 as the privatised descendant of British Coal (formerly the NCB). The sign from the A19 still says Whitemoor Mine, but it's now Whitemoor Business Park - 24 units with just 10 filled. Here are curving roadways, neatly trimmed bushes, rabbits scattering at the sound of a car, with ventilation towers looking like barley-sugar twists almost the only clue to its original purpose. At Barlby, opposite the Selby garden centre, the modern redbrick mines rescue station, with state-of-the-art equipment, has weedy pavements and an uncared-for air, betraying its growing irrelevance. North Selby pit closed in 1997. Production at Stillingfleet ceased on July 30 this year. Riccall - the last - had its life extended a few months, in light of rising coal prices: at the whim of market forces to the last. Today, it closes too. Selby, the jewel in the crown of the coalmining industry, is sliding into oblivion. </p> <p>It seems impossible that a project that so gripped the imagination at its outset has met with such an early death. In 1976, writing a piece for the Guardian on the migration of miners, I was taken by NCB public relations officer Fred Sanderson to a bridge overlooking marshalling yards at Gascoigne Wood, to hear of the wonders of the Selby project. In 1972 boreholes drilled by NCB geologist Ron Goossens had confirmed the presence of a reservoir of coal the size of the Isle of Wight. The vision of a superpit - five shafts subtly integrated into the rural Vale of York, linked by an underground network of railways and conveyors to transport coal to the one surface exit at Gascoigne Wood and thence by train to nearby power stations - captivated all who had the slightest connection with the coal industry. </p> <p>\"We were cock-a-hoop about finding this coal,\" says Sanderson. \"I thought, 'What a great product to sell.' I was working full time giving briefings to journalists from all over Europe. Coal was suddenly in fashion.\" </p> <p>\"It was a fantastic project, a tremendous opportunity to mastermind it,\" agrees Bill Forrest, who was chief mining engineer for North Yorkshire at the time. \"It brought together so many things, especially all that mining engineering know-how. The great thing was sinking the shafts, and driving the drifts [inclined tunnels] to the surface through water-bearing strata - we had to freeze the ground to do that.\" </p> <p>It was not only knowledge of the riches below ground - 10ft-thick seams of good-quality coal, tall enough to work at without bending double - that fired their enthusiasm. It was also the challenge of exploiting them in an area of high-grade farmland.\"Locals were afraid it would be transformed into Doncaster-style pit heaps,\" says Forrest. They were alarmed, too, at the prospect of an invasion of miners. </p> <p>A campaign to win hearts and minds swung into action. In one year Forrest, \"Mr Selby\" as he became known, attended 60 meetings at schools and societies. A Social Implications Working Party was set up. \"We discussed housing, libraries, provision for under-fives,\" says Canon Gwynne Richardson, who for 14 years was industrial chaplain to the Selby coalfield. </p> <p>It was a time of optimism. The NCB commissioned plans for engine houses that would blend in with the surroundings - a practice unheard of in the context of pit buildings. Roofs were to be low-pitched, cladding to echo surrounding buildings, in York stone or redbrick. Wheel washers were installed at site entrances to keep mud off roads (though, Richardson pointed out, no such constraints applied to local farmers). They even appointed an environmental officer. </p> <p>As Forrest says: \"We tried to think of everything. For example, Skipwith Common, which had never been cultivated, had rare moths and there was a worry they'd be attracted to the lights at Riccall and die. So we put in special lighting.\" </p> <p>House-buying here would be more common than renting. As it turned out, in another first for a pit, this was commuterland - these pits had huge car parks. \"Miners came from Newcastle, Bridlington, Bradford, Rotherham. A group would share a car, and take it in turns to drive,\" says Ken Rowley, former Wistow Union Branch secretary, who himself commuted from Wakefield until he was made redundant in January. He joined Wistow in 1982: \"It was a great sadness finishing at Manor colliery, where I started in 1961 - it was a family pit. But Wistow was like a brave new world - these huge machines, walk-on faces. Everything was so much bigger.\" </p> <p>\"The sheer scale of the engineering was staggering,\" says Sanderson. \"It makes the Channel Tunnel look like a fleabite.\" Brian Lewis, author of Up Sticks and a Job for Life: Voices from the Selby coalfield, agrees: \"It's like having the Eiffel Tower underground, but you don't know it's there.\" He points out that Selby is not going to be \"mothballed\" for possible use at a later stage. \"It's a bad mistake. It could be used as a research centre or for training. And how do we know we won't need the coal in the future?\" A concrete and steel plug will seal the shafts, and the distinctive architecture will not even be preserved as a heritage site. </p> <p>The argument that geology is the problem does not wash with some miners. It has as much to do with share prices, they say grimly. But things have been difficult for UK Coal, which inherited contracts for coal at premium prices. By the time of renegotiation of contracts in 1998, the world price had fallen and proceeds fell by 20%, meaning that UK Coal had to go for the lower-cost reserves available. </p> <p>And until 2001 Britain was the only country in Europe that gave no subsidy to the coal industry. In the three years before the announcement of closure in 2002, the Selby complex made losses of \u00a330m each year. Nevertheless, Selby has sold every tonne of coal produced: at its peak, in 1993-4, output was 12m tonnes with a workforce of 3,000 miners, plus a fluctuating group of contractors. Last year, with 2,000 miners, it was 5.5m. </p> <p>\"Since the geology has not been as kind as was envisaged when the complex was planned, production costs were substantially higher,\" says Stuart Oliver, UK Coal's spokesman, \"and much higher than the proceeds we've been able to obtain as coal prices have fallen dramatically since privatisation a decade ago.\" </p> <p>He also thinks that the original attempts to minimise the effect on the surrounding land by not having too many access tunnels to take out the coal might have contributed to Selby's demise: \"If there were more access points, it would have been more economic as the number of pits reduced.\" </p> <p>Thatcher's Britain, the politicisation of the Coal Board, contracts for cheap imported coal, Heseltine's closures, privatisation, lack of subsidy and the subjecting of an essential energy to market forces have all played their part in the downward spiral. Now many in the area who had once resisted the incursion of the pit are mourning its passing. The closure will affect more than 150 other businesses. </p> <p>It was not, after all, \"a job for life\". Brian Callaghan, responsible for recruiting the original miners, is troubled about that. \"I feel very sad with myself, encouraging them to take this opportunity of a lifetime. I daren't look some of them in the eye when I see them. I did it honestly, but it doesn't go down well with me.\" </p> <p>One attempt to pick up the pieces is the Riccall Regen Centre, whose smart building with glass rotunda was opened in 2000. It runs training courses, a nursery, a social club and a programme of activities that range from pantomime to a fruit and vegetable show. Its existence is due largely to the efforts of Alison Seabrooke, its chief executive, who came to the area in 1991 when her husband Mark joined the Selby pit. She saw the writing on the wall some time ago and, when Whitemoor closed, was part of a taskforce that went in to provide guidance: \"I remembered coming up with Mark in 1990 and sitting in the pit canteen, and talking about a 25-year future. It seemed so odd to be standing in the canteen telling the miners what was on offer for their future after the mine had closed.\" </p> <p>Richardson is full of regrets: \"There were key moments when something of the original spirit could have been retained to the benefit of nation and industry. It's very strange. I was here soon after the birth of the Selby coalfield, when they were just scratching the ground, and I will be participating in the funeral. I could get quite emotional about that.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Copies of Up Sticks and a Job for Life can be bought through the Selby Times, tel 01757 702802.</p>",
  "The artist Fermin Rocker, who has died aged 96, was one of the last links with the heroic era of European and American anarchism, which faded beyond hope of revival with the Spanish civil war. The younger son of the anarchist thinker and writer Rudolf Rocker, one of the last anarchists of international renown, Fermin was certainly the last person alive who remembered the brief but remarkable flowering of anarchism as a mass movement among the Yiddish-speaking migrants of London's East End, a movement all but snuffed out by the turbulence of the first world war and the countervailing attractions of the Russian revolution. <p>Fermin was greatly in awe of his father, whose tousled hair, goatee beard and corpulent frame featured in many of his early drawings and paintings. \"I looked upon him as a god,\" he wrote years later. So did many others. Rudolf Rocker was a German gentile who came to live among migrant Jews, learned Yiddish, and became an inspirational teacher and leader to a marginalised community deeply suspicious of authority, and yearning for a voice, a means of securing self-respect, and a path to education and advancement. </p> <p>The craft trade unions which Rudolf Rocker nurtured and encouraged, and the lively anarchist journals he and his colleagues published, notably the Arbaiter Fraind (The Workers' Friend), won a large following among the victims of pogroms and oppression who crowded into Stepney and Whitechapel in the years before 1914. Fermin's Russian-born mother, Milly Witcop, was also a revolutionary, one of four Jewish sisters, three of whom were prominent either as anarchists or militant feminists. </p> <p>Fermin was born in London and named after a prominent Spanish anarchist. He grew up in a tenement block in Stepney in an intensely political environment, captured with delightful irreverence in his memoir, The East End Years: A Stepney Childhood, published by the long-established anarchist imprint, Freedom Press, in 1998. As a small boy, he got to know and admire such leftwing luminaries as Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta (\"a loveable little fellow\"), sat up through long meetings in the hope that his father would tell him a bedtime story and was taken to the Jubilee Street Club, the epicentre of East End Jewish radicalism, where he used to filch paper on which to draw. </p> <p>\"There was hope in the air, an anticipation of better things to come,\" Fermin recalled. \"In later years my father would look back at it with profound nostalgia and regret. It was a time, he insisted, that still had aspirations and ideals, that still had visions of a better future, of a world more just and humane. No one dreamt what horrors the century had in store for us, what despair and disillusionment it would bring.\" </p> <p>With the first world war came repression. Rudolf Rocker was interned in Alexandra Palace, north London. Fermin remembered visiting him there. His mother was also arrested. The family was reunited in Amsterdam in 1918, moving on to Germany, where Fermin first mixed with artists and began to draw and paint. </p> <p>Then, in 1929 - with the decline of the Weimar Republic - he moved to New York. A few years later his parents followed, settling in a rural commune in New York state. </p> <p>Fermin's art was influenced by the realist school, though he was always too much of an individualist to be saddled with an easy label. He worked in New York as a draughtsman, a cartoon animator, a commercial artist, and then for many years as a book illustrator. Times were often tough. From the 1950s, he turned increasingly to oil painting, developing a hallmark style - precise, in a minor key and with a limited palette, portraying human activity (a meeting, or musical performance, or busy city street) but with each individual cocooned, isolated, even while in a common endeavour. </p> <p>His first one-man exhibition was in New York in 1944, but it was only after returning to London in 1972, with his American wife, Ruth Robins, that he began to make a living from painting. From the mid-1980s, he had a succession of successful shows, notably at the Stephen Bartley Gallery in Chelsea. He became, to some degree, and late in his life, fashionable (Mick Jagger once called round to select a canvas) - though that never influenced his art, which, in style and tone, felt as if it belonged to an earlier era. </p> <p>Few of his themes were directly political. The painting bought by Jagger, depicting a mass of Basque refugees heading away from the devastation wrought by Franco's allies towards the French border, is something of an exception. </p> <p>While standing broadly within the anarchist tradition, Fermin was impatient of its feuds, and critical of the left's reluctance to engage with the modern world and to accept that capitalism has improved lives and living standards. But some anarchists regarded Fermin almost as a crown prince. His son, Philip - who cared for him in his closing years - was always amused that the anarchist paper Freedom arrived unbidden in the mailbox. </p> <p>Fermin continued to paint in his top-floor flat in London's Tufnell Park until his last few weeks. He died peacefully in his own bed. Just 24 hours later, more than 100 admirers and well-wishers gathered at the Chambers Gallery in London's Smithfield for the private view of his first retrospective (which continues there until November 14). His wife died in 1989; he is survived by Philip. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Fermin Rocker, artist, born December 22 1907; died October 18 2004</p>",
  "Highly personal mudslinging now surrounds the Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (Letters, October 25). Regrettably, it deflects attention away from the science. <p>A key example is infant leukaemia, which, after Chernobyl, increased sharply in several countries, demonstrating a massive error in conventional radiation risk estimates. The majority report states that the committee, of which I was a member, was split four ways on this issue. One faction presumably thought there was no increase. Another is said to think leukaemia increased, but only in line with expectations, another thought it was more than expected (how much more is not reported), and the last thought it was a great deal more. An arcane technical annex falsely insists that the individual studies lacked statistical power, or used unreliable data, or failed to conform to theoretical assumptions that Cerrie was set up to test. On this basis all the studies are dismissed. In defiance of the committee's remit there is no explanation of why opinions were so divergent, merely a recommendation for more research. </p> <p>By such measures, and by excluding a minority view, Cerrie's report permits the conclusion that, however uncertain the science of radiation biology may be, the nuclear industry can enjoy business as usual. </p> <p>Cerrie was a brave attempt at a new, open and balanced way of gathering scientific advice. It incorporated strongly divergent views, so reporting was never going to be easy. The next attempt must not be allowed to descend into polemics.<br><b>Richard Bramhall</b><br> Low Level Radiation Campaign </p> <p>Professor Dudley Goodhead's defence of his suppressing the Cerrie minority report on the impacts of nuclear radiation on health is just silly. He earlier claimed that I \"bullied\" him; in fact, I have never met him and haven't spoken to him for three years. He says I \"consistently interfered with\" the committee; I never met the committee and had no contact with it in the three years it was sitting. He says the minority report was not gagged; in fact he originally gave a commitment that minority reports would be allowed, and the committee voted 10-1 to endorse this, but at the very end of the last meeting he reneged on it and forbade any discussion. But disputes between personalities are not the point. What matters is that there has been a multitude of reports, particularly in Russia after Chernobyl, but also in Germany, Greece, Belgium, Scotland and Wales, all of which indicate that the standard model used by the nuclear industry to calculate the effects of radiation on human health is simply wrong. The model is based on measuring external radiation from a nuclear bomb blast, and does not take account of the risk of people's inhaling radionuclides in the vicinity of nuclear power stations. <br><b>Michael Meacher</b><br> Environment minister 1997-2003</p>",
  "<p>Lakshmi Mittal, who is based in the UK, yesterday set his seal on the consolidation of the global steel industry with a $17.8bn (\u00a310bn) double merger to create the world's largest producer. </p> <p>Ispat Steel, where Mr Mittal has a 77% holding, is reversing into his family's privately held LNM Group and at the same time buying America's International Steel Group. </p> <p>Ispat is paying $13.3bn in shares for LNM as part of a package that will see the selling shareholders, which include the Mittal family, pick up a one-off dividend of $2bn. Meanwhile, Ispat is offering cash and paper for ISG, which values the US group at around $4.5bn. </p> <p>The deal will leave the Mittal family with an 88% holding in the new entity that will be called Mittal Steel. </p> <p>The group, which will have a market capitalisation of about $21bn, will have an annual production capacity of some 70m tonnes - outstripping the world's current leader, Acelor. </p> <p>Last year LNM, Ispat and ISG produced 48.8m tonnes of steel, according to the International Iron and Steel Institute. </p> <p>\"We are changing the entire world steel map,\" said ISG chairman Wilbur Ross. The formation of Mittal Steel would create the same sort of change in the global steel industry that the creation of ISG, which includes assets of companies such as Bethlehem Steel and Weirton Steel, had done in the US, Mr Ross said. </p> <p>Mr Mittal was equally upbeat. \"We are creating a new global powerhouse in the steel sector,\" he said. Mittal Steel will employ some 165,000 people in 14 countries in North America, Asia, Europe and Africa. </p> <p>As well as steel production it will own substantial iron ore and coal deposits, a significant advantage at a time when demand for steel is pushing raw material prices higher. On a pro forma basis it is expected to have revenues of $31.5bn and an operating income of between $6.8bn and $7bn. </p> <p>Indian-born Mr Mittal, who started his working life in the family's steel firm, created his steel empire on the back of a willingness to take on little regarded and poorly performing assets, often through privatisation programmes. </p> <p>\"He took a chance. He went into countries eight or nine years ago where other companies would not have gone until now,\" said Peter Fish, managing director of the UK consultancy MEPS International. </p> <p>Mr Mittal's first big acquisition was in Mexico, but he made his name in central and eastern Europe by taking over and turning around steel plants that were widely perceived as overmanned, badly managed and lacking in investment. </p> <p>Chris Beauman, a senior adviser at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has backed Mittal deals, said the company's success had been built on taking a different approach to other steelmakers. \"People might ask why, if it's so easy, no one else has done it. The reason is that steel companies don't do turnarounds. It is not their core business. Mittal made it his company's core business.\" </p> <p>The progress has not been without its problems. Mr Mittal ran into a row over a \u00a3125,000 Labour donation in 2001 just ahead of winning Tony Blair's backing for his bid for Romania's biggest steel maker. </p> <p>Analysts argue that the steel industry needs consolidation to cope with powerful suppliers and end users. However, Mr Fish expressed some reservations over how far yesterday's deals would take the process. </p> <p>\"The industry is being squeezed but the [LNM and Ispat] operations are fragmented. The area where the merger with ISG is most likely to have an effect is in North America. Both companies are in the US market and so that might be useful.\" </p> <p>Yesterday both Mittal and ISG were careful about detailing potential synergies, saying the matter would be left to a committee to discuss in the coming weeks. </p> <p>One reason for the caution could be that ISG has operations in Ohio, seen as one of the swing states in the US presidential election. </p> <p>News of the deal boosted shares in US steel makers on hopes that it could pave the way for further consolidation. </p> <p><strong> Company Output</strong> </p> <p>(million tonnes pa) </p> <p><strong> Mittal Steel 48.8</strong> </p> <p>Arcelor 42.8 </p> <p>LNM (inc Ispat) 35.3 </p> <p>Nippon Steel 31.3 </p> <p>JFE 30.2 </p> <p>POSCO 28.9 </p> <p>Shanghai </p> <p>Baosteel 19.9 </p> <p>Corus 19.1 </p> <p>US Steel 17.9 </p> <p> Source IISI; Based on 2003 figures</p>",
  "Whether George Bush or John Kerry wins the White House next Tuesday, the next president faces an overflowing in-tray of international problems. <p>America's global power has never been greater. But never, since the September 11 catastrophe, has America's global leadership been under such sustained challenge. Rarely have issues of foreign policy had such a direct, existential bearing on America's sense of itself and its security. Rarely has what the American president decides mattered so much to so many. </p> <p>The most immediate worry is the security situation in Iraq. As the US tries to steer the country to elections in January, the predicted surge in violence may be compounded by a Sunni Muslim poll boycott. The insurgent redoubt of Falluja is again the likely, lethal flashpoint. </p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions are moving up the agenda. On November 25, the International Atomic Energy Agency must decide whether to report Iran to the UN security council. If it does so, punitive sanctions could follow. If the UN fails to agree, the White House will come under pressure, not least from Israel, to consider unilateral measures including possible military action. </p> <p>The next president will also quickly face demands, from Britain's Tony Blair among others, to launch a new drive to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict - which many European and Arab governments view as a precondition for winning the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>Other problems in need of action include the humanitarian crisis in Sudan that Congress has termed genocide but which is proving resistant to international remedies. </p> <p>Some European diplomats fear a second Bush term could open the way for a sweeping expansion of Republican neo-conservative policies. This would only exacerbate existing divisions over issues such as the Kyoto climate change treaty, global trade and development, and international law. </p> <p>Victory for Mr Kerry would entail different kinds of uncertainty. A sort of interregnum would ensue until his inauguration next January. Once in office, a new Democratic administration would take months to settle in - confronted in all probability by a hostile Republican-controlled Congress. </p> <p>Whoever wins, these are some of the principal issues facing the next president: </p> <p><b> Anti-Americanism </b><br> </p> <p>The Bush presidency has brought a surge in anti-American sentiment, notably in the Arab, Muslim and European spheres. This phenomenon is undermining US influence and effectiveness across the board, making it difficult to persuade others to follow America's lead. </p> <p>For the first time, the US is seen by majorities in many countries, especially by younger Muslims, as a potential enemy rather than a friend. </p> <p>Such conclusions are borne out by a clutch of international opinion surveys and by an official worldwide study undertaken last year by a former US ambassador, Edward Djerejian. He found the US was losing the battle for hearts and minds. Since then, the Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib abuse scandals have further damaged America's standing abroad. </p> <p><b>Terrorism </b><br> </p> <p>While the next president will be under intense pressure to win the \"war on terror\", it remains unclear exactly who or where the enemy is - or how it can best be defeated. </p> <p>Despite the elimination of some leading al-Qaida figures, Osama bin Laden remains at large. Meanwhile, al-Qaida's cause has devolved to loose-knit, copycat groups in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Chechnya and Pakistan. The Iraq insurgency has proved both magnet and recruiting sergeant for Islamist extremists. </p> <p>Mr Bush has repeatedly claimed to have al-Qaida and its affiliates on the run. But a report this month by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London estimated that al-Qaida can potentially draw on 18,000 operatives in 60 countries. Al-Qaida, it said, had been \"galvanised\" by the Iraq war. </p> <p>Unless remedial action is taken, the \"war on terror\" will continue to be destabilising in geo-political terms. It has been used by states such as Israel, Russia and China to justify harsher treatment of nationalists and separatists. It has drawn the US into problematic alliances with undemocratic regimes in central Asia. And it has led to divisive erosion of civil liberties abroad and in the US. </p> <p><b>Proliferation </b><br> </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Kerry agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the single most serious threat to international security. While the next president's focus will be on Iran and North Korea, a bigger fear is that non-state actors such as al-Qaida will obtain WMD. North Korea claims already to have nuclear weapons. Multilateral negotiations to induce it to disarm have stalled. Mr Kerry says he will talk directly to Pyongyang, something Mr Bush refuses to do. </p> <p>Syria is another concern, as is a region-wide Middle East WMD arms race should Iran obtain the bomb. Unsecured WMD-related stockpiles in the former Soviet Union and smuggling rings like that uncovered in Pakistan are also a big worry vis \u00e0 vis future terrorist capabilities. </p> <p>All these problems are compounded by the weakness of international regulation, inspection and verification regimes and by the \"double standards\" of existing nuclear powers which refuse to renounce their weapons. </p> <p><b>Conflict zones </b><br> </p> <p>The US urgently needs more international military and UN civilian support in Iraq. Washington will ask Nato and Muslim countries to contribute additional troops at a conference in Egypt next month. Severe US military over-stretch lies behind the recent, controversial request for British redeployments in Iraq. Overall, meeting America's myriad global military commitments is becoming increasingly expensive and problematic in terms of personnel, hence the speculation about a post-election draft. </p> <p>The US remains heavily committed in Afghanistan, with 20,000 troops still fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida. There are also growing concerns about a reviving instability in the Balkans, particularly in Kosovo where final-status talks are due to begin next year. </p> <p>Israel-Palestine and Iraq apart, the Middle East as a whole remains a critical national security concern for any US president, given America's chronic dependence on oil. Bilateral post-9/11 relations with Saudi Arabia are especially fraught. </p> <p><b> Old rivals</b> </p> <p>China's rapid economic growth is creating political and geo-strategic challenges for America which the next president will be forced to address. </p> <p>Bilateral trade is booming. The Olympics are coming to Beijing. But China remains an undemocratic Communist state with a poor human rights record. President Hu Jintao is an unknown quantity. Yet the US needs China's good offices if, for example, the North Korean stand-off is to be ended. </p> <p>Russia is another potential problem, despite relatively greater stability under Mr Putin. Moscow's reaction to the Beslan school tragedy has revived questions about the Russian president's authoritarianism - which also affects countries in the \"near abroad\" like Ukraine and Georgia </p> <p>Like China, Russia is developing new long-range missiles in response to Mr Bush's \"son of Star Wars\" ballistic missile defence project, prompting fears of a new arms race. </p> <p><b> Multilateralism </b><br> </p> <p>US relations with leading European Union countries, especially France, are in need of repair. But trade and other disputes with the EU will certainly figure on the next president's agenda. </p> <p>More fundamentally challenging is the EU's gradual emergence as a global political player. Its development of a collective military capability, potentially undermining Nato, is a gauntlet that the White House may be obliged to pick up. This in turn relates to knotty questions about the legitimacy of intervention and \"just war\" concepts. </p> <p>Radically different European attitudes to the UN and upholding international law through institutions such as the world court and the international criminal court are key areas of contention. UN reform is another pressing issue. </p> <p>Underlying all these concerns is the European insistence on multilateral approaches to common problems, in contrast to Bush-era unilateralism. For the next president, perhaps the most difficult challenge will be to decide if and when the US goes it alone. If Mr Bush has proved anything, it is that even America cannot do it all.</p>",
  "A major problem for grassroots organisers, especially if we are women, is that neither Stop the War nor the unions are independent of political parties, and both sabotage any organising that doesn't serve their interests (Letters, October 25). <p>Women are central to achieving real economic and political change. Yet women were silenced at the recent European Social Forum, in which Stop the War and various unions had a controlling hand. </p> <p>Fifty organisations from 12 countries asked the ESF to hold a women's day. We were turned down - so we called our own. The ESF then hurriedly convened a short women's assembly chaired by those who opposed the women's day. When we finally spoke at the closing plenary, many agreed that a women's day should be integral to the ESF. They also agreed that there is no place at the ESF for police being called on protesters, and for pro-war Iraqi men being given a platform, while anti-war Iraqi women, asylum seekers and Haitians opposed to the US-French coup are not.<br><b>Anna Thorburn</b><br>Global Women's Strike <b>Tina Baguma</b><br> All African Women's Group <b>Charo Luque Galvez</b><br>Mujeres de Negro, Spain <b>Eva Thun</b><br>Women's News, Hungary <b>Katarzyna Gawlicz</b><br>Wroclaw University, Poland <b>Renata Franmartino</b><br>Unione Donne Migranti Per La Pace, Italy <b>Sara Callaway</b><br>Women of Colour in the Global Women's Strike <b>Anna Kaminska</b><br> Pre-Election Coalition of Women, Poland <b>Asun Navarro</b><br> Collectiu 8 de Marc, Alcoi, Spain <b>Carolyn Kagan</b><br> Director Research Institute for Health and Social Change, Manchester Metropolitan University <b>Dee Coombes</b><br> Liverpool Committee Against the Destitution of Asylum Seekers <b>Domenico D'Anna</b><br> Segreteria Provinciale Modena, Confederazione Generale <b>Italiana Lavoratori</b><br>CGIL, Italy <b>Ingrid McClements</b><br> Scotland <b>Katarina Ferro</b><br> ARGE Feminismus, Austria <b>Katarzyna Szumlewicz</b><br> Poland<br><b>Maggie Ronayne</b><br> Global Women's Strike, Ireland<br> <b>Marek Krakowski</b><br> Poland<br> <b>Margarita Morales</b><br> England<br> <b>Mariangela Casalucci</b><br> Manchester Social Forum, in a personal capacity<br> <b>Owen English</b><br> Indymedia Oxford, in a personal capacity<br> <b>Payday men's network</b><br> England, Italy<br><b>Sara Williams</b><br> Global Women's Strike, Spain<br> <b>Stephen Porter</b><br> Independent Venezuela Network, Chesterfield</p>",
  "Victory is a formality for Hamid Karzai now. With only a handful of votes still uncounted in Afghanistan's historic election, the US-backed leader is streaking ahead of his nearest rival with 55% of ballots. <p>The result surprises nobody. Urbane, charismatic and competent, Mr Karzai wooed billions of dollars in international aid after the US bombed the Taliban from power in 2001. Now he has proved the charm sparkles at home too.</p> <p>Although Mr Karzai's core support came from fellow Pashtuns, many Afghans, particularly in the cities, voted across ethnic lines. And despite howls of complaint about vote rigging from his opponents, they now look likely to accept the result.</p> <p>The poll was also an indirect endorsement of US involvement in Afghanistan where, in contrast with Iraq, Americans are not viewed as an occupying force. Thousands of miles away President George Bush, desperate for a counterpoint to the Baghdad quagmire, has been crowing on the campaign stump about the glories of Afghanistan.</p> <p>Meanwhile his military commanders are boasting that the Taliban, who failed to deliver on fiery threats of scuppering the poll, are effectively finished.</p> <p>Such talk is premature. Despite the heart-warming tableau of millions of illiterate people queuing to vote, Afghanistan's democratic transition is far from certain. A host of rapacious forces - warlords, weapons, and drugs money - are looming large in advance of the real electoral test.</p> <p>In reality this election, although inspiring, was little more than a Karzai popularity plebiscite against the backdrop of an opposition beauty pageant. Most voters saw little choice between the modernising incumbent with the powerful US ambassador at his elbow; and a motley array of warlords, Islamic fundamentalists and varied no-hopers with little hope of bridging divides.</p> <p>Nevertheless the contest was not entirely theatre. Though nobody expected to beat Mr Karzai, his nearest contender Yunus Qanooni hoped to push him to a runoff vote. Warlords more accustomed to directing tank battles sought to stake out their political turf and, in the scramble, quietly efface their bloodstained histories of wartime atrocities.</p> <p>The parliamentary elections, on the other hand, will present much higher stakes. Hundreds of candidates, some backed up by warlords, will be running for office. In a craggy country awash with weapons, that could make for a dangerous contest - unless Mr Karzai acts fast.</p> <p>His first step will be the appointment of a cabinet. Until now, Mr Karzai has appeased the warlords, hoping to lure them out of fatigues and into business suits with promises of government jobs. For example it is widely expected that Ismail Khan, the 'Lion of Heart', will be offered a ministerial position.</p> <p>But civil society, human rights and some government officials say this policy must stop. They favour shunning the hardmen, arguing it is time for a clean break with the conflict-ridden past. But the polling figures make the choice less easy for Mr Karzai.</p> <p>Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, polled a respectable 10% of votes while Mohammed Mohaqeq, a Hazara hardman, took 12%. Having, as they see it, legitimised their positions, the warlords are now expected to lobby hard for government jobs.</p> <p>They have other bargaining chips too. Although legally required to sever links with their private armies before the election, warlords like Dostum retain the informal loyalty of thousands of roaming militiamen.</p> <p>An estimated 40,000 gunmen have skirted demobilisation, a process Mr Karzai is keen to accelerate before the April poll. So in choosing a cabinet, he may have to balance sidelining the warlord leaders against demobilising their troops.</p> <p>Karzai also faces a thorny technocratic issue. In a country where no census has been carried out for decades, the demarcation of about 350 electoral districts remains in dispute. The boundaries are controversial and are sure to provoke regional disputes. But to dally in settling them, says UN election adviser Reginald Austin, could have a disastrous effect on preparing for the April poll.</p> <p>The Taliban factor is more uncertain than ever. Euphoria at the lack of election violence was dampened by a suicide bombing in Kabul last Saturday that killed one American and two Afghans, one an 11-year-old girl.</p> <p>Much may depend on the attitude of neighbouring Pakistan, which has publicly allied itself with Karzai yet still tolerates the presence of thousands of Taliban in edgy northern cities such as Quetta and Peshawar.</p> <p>The coming election may also call the international community's bluff. This month\u00b9s poll could have been a disaster. Only a year ago the UN-led preparations were marred by poor security, lack of funds and a frozen voter registration process. In the end though, a combination of expert planning and Afghan determination saw it through.</p> <p>But only a few hundred international observers were deployed to Afghanistan, in contrast with thousands deployed to landmark elections in Cambodia, South Africa and East Timor over the past 11 years. Next time, it won't be so easy.</p> <p>Observers are crucial. They help ensure a fair contest, help prevent cheating and make sure gunmen don't badger voters on their way into the booths. And although lip service is paid to 'Afghanisation' of the preparations \u00ad which is often a figleaf excuse for security concerns - lingering distrust between local politicians means international assistance is key to underwriting the process.</p> <p>But to assign even one monitor for every two polling centres in Afghanistan would require about 2,500 people, and many more international peacekeepers. And most of the 18,000 US-led troops are hunting the Taliban or al-Qaida, while about another 9,000 Nato-led soldiers are limited to Kabul and a handful of other cities.</p> <p>Greater international deployment would be both expensive and dangerous. But now that Afghanistan has taken its first tentative step to democracy there are few other choices.</p> <p>Stopping is impossible. But to perform the job half-heartedly could fatally damage Afghans' newfound faith in voting. Either way, it could risk the implosion of an impressive, but still worryingly fragile, achievement.</p>",
  "<p>There is much to be criticised in Bjorn Lomborg's The Sceptical Environmentalist, and he has a number of serious critics, but Tom Burke is not one of them (This is neither scepticism nor science - just nonsense, October 23). </p> <p>Lomborg's criticism of left environmentalism is, indeed, highly political, but capable statistician that he is, he has some convincing figures with which to argue his case. And as for politics, what is the Kyoto protocol if not a primarily political agenda? It is certainly not a scientifically rigorous plan of action to address global warming. </p> <p>What irritates me is environmental scientists and activists using hyperbole to attract media and funding agency attention, and then recoiling in horror when someone like Lomborg dares criticise them.<br><strong>Dr Francis Sedgemore</strong><br>London </p> <p>Burke's excellent piece on Bjorn Lomborg raised some interesting points about the darling of oil corporations, neo-conservative politicians and neo-liberal economists. Lomborg states we should be as sceptical about the claims of environmentalists as we are about the claims of big business. We should be even more sceptical about controversial popular science books written by academics. </p> <p>Lomborg portrays a world where benevolent corporations, neo-con politicians and neo-liberal economist are prepared to put minor environmental considerations on temporary hold as an altruistic act to save the world's poor, while villainous environmentalists attempt to sacrifice hungry children at the temple of deep green ecology. </p> <p>The last earth summit showed a very different reality. The corporations, organisations and nations that have sabotaged Kyoto were fighting to maintain the developing worlds' debt burden. Most genuine environmentalists believe passionately in environmental and social justice for all, which is why we have a common vision with develop ment and human rights NGOs, which includes protecting the world's poor from the appalling consequences of environmental degradation and climate change.<br> <strong>Andy Wragg</strong><br> Chobham, Surrey </p> <p>It is just not good enough for Burke to argue that action on global warming cannot be subjected to a cost-benefit analysis. Of course the justification for action involves consideration of future benefits against present costs. To pretend otherwise, and to descend to personalised attacks on Lomborg, rather suggests that Green arguments may not be as strong as we thought.<br> <strong>Hugh Pemberton</strong><br>Bath </p> <p>Lomborg assumes that an additional $50bn could be made available for good causes over the next four years, and it is certainly arguable that the immediate priority for this should be HIV/Aids, malnutrition and malaria. But that is precisely because funds could be directed to a relatively small proportion of the world's overall population with quick results. </p> <p>Climate change is a problem of a totally different order, requiring gradual adaptation of lifestyle and technology over decades. If we, the Europeans, cannot show 1 billion Chinese people how to build a CO2-minimising society, then that will threaten billions of other people. There are huge uncertainties about the timing of climate change and the best ways to mitigate and adapt; there are no uncertainties about the magnitude of the problem.<br> <strong>Christopher Beauman</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>Superstition is a pretty slippery concept, and we need to examine what we mean by it. The simple statement that a superstition is an irrational belief is quite adequate for most purposes, as long as we don't enquire too closely into the meaning of the word 'irrational'. But not every irrational belief gets labelled as superstition, so we need to look a bit closer. One of the key characteristics of superstition is a belief in the existence of luck, as a real force in life, and that luck can be predicted by signs, and can be controlled or influenced by particular actions or words. Other key elements include a belief in fate, which again can be predicted and manipulated, and a belief in fate, which again can only be described as magic - the idea that people can be harmed or protected by spells, charms, amulets, curses, witchcraft, and so on.</p> <p>Superstitions are also unofficial knowledge, in that they run counter to the official teachings of religion, school, science, and government, and this is precisely why - even in the 21st century - many of us like to hold onto a few, to show that we are not totally ruled by science and hard fact.</p> <p>The Pocket Guide To Superstitions is a book of historical research, the result of years of searching for examples of superstitions in every source we can think of - novels, plays, poetry, children's books, newspapers, magazines, diaries - going back as far as we can. We also listened to people on buses, on the radio, in the playground, in the supermarket, and so on, to learn what is being said and done now.</p> <p>We examined statements, and asked questions. It is frequently said, for example, that the fear of spilling salt goes back to the Last Supper and, to prove it, that Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the event shows Judas spilling salt. But it doesn't. One piece of 'evidence' put forward to support the completely groundless idea that 'Ring a ring a roses' goes back to the plague is that sneezing was a main symptom of that disease. It wasn't. It turns out that Friday 13th is a Victorian invention. 'Touch wood', it is claimed, is based on a belief in tree spirits, but is there evidence we ever believed in tree spirits?</p> <p>What we ended up with was a mass of material on the subject, which was organised and analysed to provide data for informed judgements instead of guesses. The first principle of the historical approach is that if a superstition cannot be found before, say, 1850, the idea that it has survived from an ancient fertility ritual or pre-Christian sacrifice 1,200 years before seems a bit far-fetched. If it existed in that time, how come nobody noticed it? And if there is no evidence for its existence, how can we base our theory of origin on it? If it had existed underground for all that time it would probably have changed beyond all recognition anyway (imagine a game of Chinese whispers lasting for 1,200 years), so an examination of the modern version is unlikely to tell us anything about the original. Our historical approach enabled us to make estimates of the age, development, and relative popularity of particular beliefs, and start to make general statements about how superstitions function. Occasionally, our research also threw light on the question of how superstitions arose in the first place. </p> <p>One thing which became obvious when we compared a whole mass of reported superstitions was that most are based on a small number of principles which are repeated time and time again in different guises, and the formulae can tell us a great deal. The two most widespread, for example, are that you must not tempt fate (don't count your chickens before they're hatched) and that beginnings dictate the future course of events. The concern for good beginnings is reflected in the first-footing customs at New Year, giving a baby a coin to ensure future good fortune, getting out of bed on the correct side to start the day well, and so on. On the negative side, don't stumble as you leave the house, don't see an unlucky person on the way to your fishing boat, and so on. A third principle, far more complex if fully analysed, is that the natural world 'knows' what is going to happen in human life - a robin tapping at the window means a death in the house very soon; a dog howling at your door means the same.</p> <p>The world of superstition is essentially a symbolic one, although in most cases only on a very simple level. Money in the pocket at a key moment (for example, when hearing the first cuckoo in spring) stands for prosperity in the coming year, whereas an empty purse symbolises want. A piece of coal carried by a first footer represents warmth and comfort; an upturned bowl in a seafaring family stands for an upturned ship. This feeling for the symbolic is often little more than a weak pun - washing on certain days 'washes one of the family away', for example, or 'turn your chair to turn your luck'.</p> <p>Another conclusion that is clearly supported by a historical review is that we, as a society, are much less superstitious than we were 100, or even 50, years ago. Although few people (myself included) can claim to be completely free of superstition, many of us only play at it nowadays. This claim can be demonstrated in several different ways, most notably by asking someone to name 10 superstitions; most people will not be able to get beyond five without really thinking hard about it, whereas a century ago, the average person would have known dozens.</p> <p>Even those we still know are relatively colourless, being nearly always simply a matter of 'bad luck', whereas in the past they would have had more individual meanings - a death, you won't get married, a stranger is coming, and so on. Regional differences have been largely ironed out, and the same beliefs are found all over the country. But the real acid test is that however superstitious a person may think they are, few act on their superstitions in the way previous generations did. Who would accept being turned down for a job because they had red hair or the wrong sun sign? Who would phone work and say, \"I can't be in today because I saw a magpie as I left home\"? We might try a traditional cure like a key down the back for a nosebleed, but who would accept a verbal charm rather than hospital treatment to stop real bleeding? Who would tell a young mother that her baby will die if she weighs it, or lets it see its reflection in a mirror? And so on, through hundreds of different superstitions which were believed and acted upon only a century ago. </p> <p>But why were people so superstitious? It is usually assumed that superstition is the result of fear and uncertainty - an attempt to control the parts of life that are in fact beyond our understanding or control. This is largely true, and there is some evidence that superstition is more prevalent in people involved in dangerous occupations, and increases in times of particular uncertainty, such as during a war. But there are other forces involved. Superstitions are passed on from person to person, often within a family, and take on the authority of tradition. It must be said that, in the past, various people made a living out of their neighbour's willingness to believe in magical cures, love potions, and the need for protection against ill-wishing.</p> <p>The main reason for the decline of superstition in modern times is that many of these uncertainties have declined - whole areas of life, from the trivial to the life-threatening, have had the mystery and danger removed from them to a large extent. Childhood diseases still exist, and parents still have worries, but nothing compared with a century ago. Changes in everyday technology have brought almost instant death to many beliefs. The light-bulb and the radiator provide little scope for superstition, or romance, whereas the candle and the open fire had plenty. Baking bread, turning the bed, churning butter, washing by hand, sweeping the house, laying out a corpse n the front room, killing a pig - all these activities were highly charged with beliefs, but have changed beyond recognition, or disappeared from our lives completely. How many of us know the phases of the moon?</p> <p>It could be argued that superstitious impulses in society are not dead, but are simply resurfacing in the guise of alternative medicines, unofficial pick-and-mix religions, astrology, conspiracy theories, and new-age cults and gurus of various kinds. But one major area where most of us can claim to be less prone to irrational thinking is in the matter of witchcraft. However badly things are going, however ill we may feel, few would think that the cause was our neighbour's spite or the spells of a witch. In this area at least, people nowadays have more sense.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from A Pocket Guide to Superstitions of the British Isles, by Steve Roud, published by Penguin.</p>",

This takes account of ballot papers which were returned over the weekend, along with those which were sent to the region's 23 local authorities yesterday.</p> <p>With 10 days left to go for the remaining 1.5 million voters - the ballot closes at 10pm on November 4 - the rate of returns (338,650) bodes well for campaigners.</p> <p>The local government minister, Nick Raynsford, has made clear that a risible electoral turnout is likely to see the spectre of a regional assembly in the north east scrapped, even if the majority vote in favour. But Mr Raynsford has nevertheless refused to set a voting threshold beneath which the result would be void.</p> <p>Voters are being asked for their say on two issues: their support for or against a new tier of local government, and the form of unitary government they would want to see in place should it come into existence.</p> <p>Following recommendations by the boundary committee, most areas will be faced with the option of a county-wide unitary authority, or two or three smaller unitaries achieved by merging neighbouring district councils.</p> <p>The latest results came as the all-postal ballot faced an unexpected hiccup, after around 80 residents in the village of Middleton St George, near Darlington, received cancer gift aid envelopes in which to send off their ballot paper. A council spokesman said the mistake was made after printers mixed up the batches.</p> <p>However the mistake is not expected to impact on the number of ballots being returned. This is because the envelopes are windowed, with the council's address printed on the ballot paper clearly showing. \"It is just a different vehicle for carrying the forms back to the office,\" the spokesman said. \"It should not affect voting.\"</p> <p>The postal ballot has so far had a clean run, with no complaints of voting irregularities or electoral fraud being lodged to date. However, the Audit Commission confirmed it had issued warnings to councils in the Durham area to remind them of the strict rules surrounding the publicity code during a forthcoming election. Such rules prevent councils campaigning for or against regional assemblies during the election period.</p> <p>\"We have received correspondence from the public regarding the forthcoming referendum and the activities of some of the councils in Durham,\" a statement read. \"We have written to these councils reminding them of their obligations under the Local Government Act 1972 but we have taken no formal action.\"</p>",
  "<p>While many of you yesterday were surprisingly reticent about Mike Riley's display on Sunday, perhaps blinded by a stray cup of soup, he doesn't escape quite so easily from your vitriol today, while Ruud van Nistelrooy may have picked on the wrong man this time.</p> <p> \"Having watched the game in Manchester and reading the report from the so-called referee chief, I am amazed that he can say that Riley handled the game well,\" thunders Bob King. </p> <p>\"His leniency gave United the green light for the thuggery that occurred. Neville and van Nistelrooy were a disgrace and it appeared they were out for revenge from the last encounter. I hope they can take it as well as give it, as I am sure Highbury will be very interesting,\" he goes on to say, while shaking his fist threateningly in the vague direction of Manchester.</p> <p>Pete Dunstan is similarly unimpressed with England's top referee, \"Why is Mike Riley's performance, which involved no less than FOUR separate incidents of blatantly ignoring the rules regarding the administration of disciplinary cards as clearly defined by Fifa, not subjected to any serious analysis by the media?\" Erm, there's hardly been a media blackout on his display, Pete.</p> <p>Riley's past displays at the soup kitchen formerly known as Old Trafford haven't done him any favours with you either.</p> <p>\"When you look at Mr Riley's record of penalties given to Man Utd in the past, surely the FA should have known better than to let him officiate this tinderbox of a match,\" says KW Soohoo from Malaysia.</p> <p>\"Perhaps the FA will learn from this and never let Mr Riley within 50 miles of Old Trafford again.\" And keeping him away from the frothing-mouthed hordes at Highbury may be a good idea too while they're at it.</p> <p>We should probably leave for Riley, before we start blaming him for the possible re-election of Bush, the absence of a left-footed midfielder good enough to play for England, and why the much promised 24 hour pubs aren't open yet.</p> <p>Shifting to another hate figure to emerge from Sunday's face off, Lewis is determined to exact revenge on United's equine striker.</p> <p>\"I've had enough of watching the downright nasty challenges/petulant kicks regularly dished out, unpunished, by Ruud can Nistelrooy,\" he rants.</p> <p>\"I therefore emailed the FA on Sunday night to request, nay demand, they take action. A bit sad I know, but lo and behold, he's charged the next day and I'm taking no small amount of satisfaction from the idea that my email may have helped nail the...\"</p> <p>However, many of you still don't afford the Gunners any sympathy for the treatment they received at the weekend, from the referee or the opposition.</p> <p>\"You can't win pretty all the time. You need to dig in and mix it up. Arsenal need to realise this or they will never develop to be the dominant force they desire,\" James Pearson argues.</p> <p>\"You can't blame the referee - there are injustices every week in football, that is the beauty of the game.\" May I contend that it was a struggle to find the beauty of the game after the injustice of the Hand of God in 1986.</p> <p>Rotemi agrees that the champions need to toughen up if they are going to progress. \"They've got to psychologically adjust to teams playing ugly against them. It's a mark of respect - no team in England, perhaps even Europe, could beat them playing an open game. The better teams will do whatever they need to do to disrupt Arsenal.\"</p> <p>Amongst the questioning of the referee, the questioning of Arsenal, and the plot to bring down Ruud van Nistelrooy, soup remains a pertinent question. Namely how and why?</p> <p>\"Since when has soup been dished out as an after match refreshment?\" begins a confused Alex Blackburn-Elliot. \"What happens after a match now? Are players to form an orderly queue, each one given their own bowl and then a former player, one who has been kept on in a coaching role but cannot coach, is then assigned the job of soup duty, carefully ladling out the broth?\"</p> <p>\"Maybe it is the job for those who are substituted to get the soup warming up. Henry hardly ever gets subbed so maybe he's just no good at soup. Phil Neville must have thought he was on permanent soup duty until Sunday.\" Quite.</p>",
  "When Eric Rohmer released The Lady and the Duke three years ago, French critics hated it so much they suggested he ought to be guillotined. He had committed the unpardonable sin of portraying French revolutionaries as brutal, drunken oafs, and the bouffanted aristos as noble agitators for justice. <p>Two years on, Rohmer has released another period drama, set this time among White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 spies in the pre-war political turmoil of Paris in 1936. Triple Agent is not, on the face of it, a film likely to win over sceptical critics. \"It is by far the most verbose of my films,\" he says proudly as he reclines in his Paris office. </p> <p>This is a worrying claim given that Rohmer is historically the talkiest director in a film culture not noted for keeping quiet. In fact, the French critics have adored Triple Agent. One wrote: \"It is a spy film without action, a tragic love story founded on words, in which Rohmer reinvents himself while remaining the same. Admirable.\" </p> <p>Surely, then, given that Rohmer is now 84 and still the least honoured of all those great French film directors who made up the Nouvelle Vague (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette), it is time for the critics to put their guillotines away and agitate for a combined l\u00e9gion d'honneur and lifetime Oscar. </p> <p>It won't happen. Rohmer has often been a director who irritates people, especially critics (perhaps partly because he was one himself). Pauline Kael wrote: \"His sensibility would be easier to take if he'd stop directing to a metronome.\" Those misgivings were best expressed by Gene Hackman who, as a detective in the 1975 film Night Moves, said: \"I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kind of like watching paint dry.\" (Though it was Rivette who really did make a film in which paint dried - La Belle Noiseuse, 1991.) </p> <p>Rohmer's best known work, My Night with Maud (1969), is about a man who spends a night with the eponymous hotsy-totsy divorcee. Instead of seducing Maud, he discusses Pascal's wager and the Jansenist philosophy of predestination until sunrise. Rohmer is a devout Catholic and the film's moral, should one be inclined to find anything so reductive in an Eric Rohmer film, is that self-restraint is the path to salvation. </p> <p>Rohmer says many of his films consist of a \"story that deals less with what people do than with what is going on in their heads while they are doing it\". No wonder, perhaps, that he has been attacked for being a novelist working in the wrong medium. </p> <p>Triple Agent, Rohmer claims, is typical of his oeuvre: \"All my films are spy films in a sense. They all deal with characters spying on others or being suspicious of others.\" But it is hardly James Bond? \"True. Genre films don't interest me at all.\" </p> <p>Rohmer's scenario for Triple Agent was inspired by an enigmatic story he found in a historical journal about the abduction by the Soviets of a White Russian general called General Miller, the president of the Russian War Veterans. His deputy, General Skobline, a double agent working for the Bolsheviks, was suspected of having had a hand in the kidnapping. This could never be proved - he disappeared shortly afterwards, leaving his wife to take the rap. She was convicted as an accessory and died in prison in 1940. Did Skobline betray his wife? Did she know about the abduction? Whose side was Skobline really on? </p> <p>\"There was nothing clear about the story, no certainty as to what happened or why, so it left me free to invent my own version of it,\" says Rohmer. </p> <p>And he did. Setting his drama amid contemporary newsreels showing the election of Leon Blum's Popular Front government in 1936, the start of the Spanish civil war, the start of the second world war and the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Rohmer plunges us into a murky political milieu. \"All epochs are unclear,\" says Rohmer. \"This is why I'm interested in history. It enables us to discover the truth of the past. We can even discover the truth with the help of fiction.\" </p> <p>In Rohmer's hands, General Skobline mutates from a double to a possible triple agent called Fyodor, a White Russian in Paris who may be spying for the Bolsheviks, the Nazis, the Tsarists - or none of them. This vain, enigmatic, politically astute man is wonderfully played by Serge Renko, a dead-ringer for Henry Fonda and just as compelling a screen presence. But we only see this spy talk about what he does. As a result, we share his wife's mounting suspicions. \"I don't show a spy at work,\" says Rohmer. \"Rather, a woman who asks herself whether her husband is a spy. This is why Triple Agent relies on words rather than action.\" </p> <p>The film resembles a late Henry James novel, where even our interpretations of what the characters are saying or doing are untrustworthy. It doesn't allow us to make easy moral judgments and is thus akin to almost all of Rohmer's earlier films. </p> <p>Triple Agent takes place in a Parisian milieu that would have been familiar to the teenage Rohmer. \"What I remember, more than anything else, was the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937 that seemed to reflect the political climate of the time. Each nation had a pavilion on the opposite side of the Seine to the Eiffel Tower.\" Very slowly, Rohmer pulls himself to his feet, comes round his desk and hobbles, hunchbacked, towards the film poster on the opposite wall so he can point out a detail. He is wearing worn Reeboks and jeans, with only the sartorial touch of a cravat to suggest a dignified Frenchman. \"On the poster you can see on the left the German pavilion. On the right there is the Soviet one - two bombastic totalitarian powers facing each other.\" </p> <p>Paris made Rohmer. He first became a reporter there and subsequently a novelist, before being captivated by film at Henri Langlois's Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise after the war. Such was its impact that he changed his name from Jean-Marie Maurice Scherer. \"Eric\" was a homage to the great German director Erich von Stroheim, while Rohmer was an allusion to Sax Rohmer, who wrote the Fu Manchu novels. He was editor-in-chief at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in its Nouvelle Vague heyday from 1956-63. </p> <p>Then, in the 1960s, he turned to making films full-time. Long before Kryzysztof Kieslowski, Rohmer made films in cycles, creating a series of six so-called Moral Tales, though he found success only towards the end of the decade with The Collector, My Night with Maude and Claire's Knee. They dealt with the virtues of self-restraint and characteristically featured glamorous women who were more intelligent, complex and engaging than his men. In the 1980s he produced a second cycle dealing with deception, called Comedies and Proverbs, the most human and charming of which was The Green Ray (1986). </p> <p>Now, 54 years after his cinematic debut, Rohmer is still making cherishable films. What will the evidently frail director do next? \"I still plan to make films. But I never discuss future projects.\" Does he feel any connection to modern French cinema? \"Listen, I am too old to go to the cinema. I'd rather watch things on TV and I prefer to watch old films now.\" </p> <p>Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma recently claimed French cinema was in crisis, with little of merit coming from new directors. \"People are always talking about crises in cinema. I may have done when I was a journalist. Lots of films are made in France. Are there too many? I can't judge.\" </p> <p>Is there nobody you admire in current French cinema? \"I'm not really aware of people in the current cinema.\" Then he adds wearily: \"There are many film-makers I admire in France, but all of them are dead.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Triple Agent goes on general release on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>Proposals to extend paid maternity leave beyond the existing six months should feature prominently in Labour's general election manifesto, Patricia Hewitt said today.</p> <p>The trade and industry secretary also announced plans to narrow the gap between men and women's pay, by giving women better job opportunities in traditionally male-dominated areas.</p> <p>Ms Hewitt said ministers were looking carefully at the implications for employers and taxpayers of extending paid maternity leave, but stressed that the idea was a \"high priority\" for the government. Earlier this year, employers' representatives voiced concerns after Ms Hewitt floated the idea.</p> <p>At present, mothers are entitled to six months' paid leave - at 90% of salary for the first few weeks, then \u00a3100 a week for the remainder - and six months unpaid.</p> <p>At Labour's annual conference in Brighton, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, endorsed Ms Hewitt's idea, saying Labour would set as a goal for another term in office a total of 12 months' paid parental leave in order to \"give parents more choice to stay at home for the first year of their child's life\".</p> <p>At a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission and held at 11 Downing Street today, Ms Hewitt was asked whether she stood by her idea.</p> <p>She said: \"Of course I stand by it. And it is a shared goal across government. We continue to increase the support and the choice that we give parents about how they balance work and family. Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months.</p> <p>\"We are looking at how quickly we can do that. Clearly there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost. Obviously I hope it will feature high in the manifesto on which we fight the next election.\"</p> <p>Ms Hewitt also announced plans to give women better job opportunities in traditionally male industries such as IT, construction, engineering and science. The proposals are part of an initiative to close the 19.5% gap between the average hourly earnings of men and women in full-time employment.</p> <p>She cited research suggesting that over 60% of all working women are concentrated in just 10 occupations which typically pay the least. And although women make up 49% of the total workforce, they make up less than 10% in engineering and just 1% in construction.</p> <p>The new plans include careers advisers offering more information about traditionally male jobs to schoolgirls; a new drive to increase the number of female entrepreneurs starting up their own businesses; funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs in those industries; adult education \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional subjects, such as plumbing for women, and childcare for men.</p> <p>Ms Hewitt said: \"It is not government's job to dictate employment options to people, but we must give women more choice if we are to address the chronic pay gap.</p> <p>\"Getting rid of career sexism is vital to closing the pay gap and I have asked our women and work commission to come up with further proposals. It is also vital to British industry and our wider economy. In a time of fierce global competition, we need to plug our skills gap and cannot afford to neglect anyone's talent.\"</p> <p>Ms Hewitt also announced that the DTI will provide \u00a380,000 funding for an Equal Pay Experts Panel, run by the TUC. </p> <p>The project will advise companies on equal pay reviews, and build on the TUC Equal Pay project which has already trained more than 400 union equal pay representatives based in companies.</p>",
  "<p>A local councillor has attacked a decision to review a local tradition held for the past 50 years as part of the Remembrance Day service because of health and safety fears.</p> <p>The paper poppy shower launched from the roof of West Bromwich town hall has been a regular part of remembrance celebrations in Sandwell since before the Second World War.</p> <p>But fire inspectors have banned the practice after telling Sandwell council they were unhappy with the way the poppies were distributed from the roof space of the town hall. Storing the poppies there could constitute a hazard and trap people if there was a fire, they said. </p> <p>Council chiefs said they would now look for an alternative place to use for launching the poppies.</p> <p>But Keith Davies, the council's cabinet member for community, neighbourhood services and safety, said he would do all he could to reinstate the traditional commemoration.</p> <p>\"Even if it means I've got to do it myself and take a fire extinguisher, I'm determined it's going to go ahead. Poppies will be falling on November 14,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Davies blamed Britain's growing litigation culture for the decision: \"It seems very strange that we have been doing this for the past 50-odd years and all of a sudden, it's a health and safety issue.</p> <p>\"We have got to remember the reason why it's being done. It's an act of remembrance.\" </p> <p>Jim Onions, from West Midlands fire service, said they had a legal requirement to act after concerns were raised by a worker at the town hall. </p> <p>He told local radio station BBC WM the issue was about the \"wholly inappropriate\" method of getting to the roof space for the six workers who would have to release the poppies.</p> <p>Access was via two vertical ladders and by crawling along 150ft pipes. </p> <p>\"If there were to be a fire, these people would have to crawl backwards and down the vertical ladders. We can't allow their safety to be compromised. It's not about poppy petals,\" he said</p> <p>Mr Onions stressed: \"Just because it hasn't happened in the past, doesn't mean it can't happen. There are no fire alarms and no sprinklers [in the building]. There's every possibility there could be a fire.</p> <p>\"It's an unsafe practice . . . If we were to allow this to continue and there was a fire and somebody was injured or killed, you would be demanding answers from ourselves.\"</p> <p>The cabinet member for environment and transport, Bob Badham, said: \"It is normal practice for the fire inspectors to identify risks and the council has a duty of care to ensure employees' health and safety, and we would not want to do anything to compromise that.</p> <p>\"It may be that someone has been a bit mischievous in presenting this situation as a row - we were already talking to the fire service about finding alternative ways to release the poppies, and people can rest assured we will do everything to keep up the tradition.\"</p> <p>The decision follows several bans on bonfires in the West Midlands to celebrate Guy Fawkes Night.</p> <p>A public bonfire in Pype Hayes Park, Birmingham, was banned for \"environmental reasons\" because it could add to air pollution and damage grass. </p> <p>A fire in Coleshill, Warwickshire, was dropped for health and safety reasons even though it is usually built by firefighters and situated next to the town's fire station.</p>",

  "<p>Some people no doubt thought or even told Baldev Singh he was bonkers when he chucked in his job to train as a school teacher. Friends and colleagues might have wondered why anyone would want to swap a university post in cancer research for the delights - not obvious to everybody - of teaching biology to 12-year-olds. </p> <p>\"I used to have to do a bit of teaching of medical students when I was doing the research and it was the bit of the job that I enjoyed more than any other,\" he says. \"It was just the love of teaching. I really do enjoy working with people. Research can be a very solitary career. It was all lab-based.\" </p> <p>But wasn't it an enormous jump from teaching medical students at Bristol University? \"Not really. The content of the A-level course is pretty much the same as the first year of university. It shouldn't be, but I found it wasn't that different.\" </p> <p>And so Singh, 39, took the leap and in 1998 pitched up as a newly qualified teacher at John Cabot city technology college in the Kingswood district of Bristol. This school, with 1,100 pupils, specialises in science and technology. Each day is an hour longer than the standard school day and the year consists of five terms of roughly eight weeks each. </p> <p>By now, six years later, anyone else might be thinking that they were starting to get to grips with the job. Not Singh. From his earliest days in his new career, he seized it by the throat. </p> <p>\"Baldev only started teaching in 1998,\" begins the nomination written by Henry Warren, co-founder of Africa Bookcase, a charity that aims to facilitate education in the developing world, \"yet he is already having a major impact in his own institution, nationally and globally.\" </p> <p>Globally? Surely the best a recently qualified teacher could expect by way of travel would be to take a class on a geography field trip. But since teaching at John Cabot, Singh has been working in Cairo, Singapore, Jordan and Alexandra, a township outside Johannesburg. How has he managed it? </p> <p>The stint purely as a biology teacher lasted three years, during which time he exploited his interest and skill in information technology to aid his teaching. The critical factor, he says, came in September 2002, when it became a requirement that all secondary schools teach citizenship. \"I thought, wouldn't it be great if you could teach kids citizenship using IT? I created a course called eCitizenship for all key stage 3 pupils.\" This enables full coverage of both the citizenship and the ICT curriculum via a website. </p> <p>\"We've shown that eCitizenship has made an impact on the learning of topics that would be difficult to teach in the normal classroom,\" he says. \"And I've found children enjoy developing skills within a meaningful context.\" Ask them, for instance, to produce a bar chart showing the sales of different types of drink in the school canteen and they will find it quite boring, he says. \"If you ask them to analyse the census data for Bristol and produce a bar chart of the diverse communities where they live, that's more meaningful.\" </p> <p>But the subject has gone far beyond bar charts. Singh was selected by Africa Bookcase to test out a software package called Gemini, which allows children across the world to communicate and collaborate on curriculum-based projects using the internet. \"It allowed us to link with two schools in India. My students were working on a joint project with students there called 'road map to peace' in which they were trying to explore why there's conflict in Israel and Palestine and what children can do.\" </p> <p>Gemini afforded a chatroom facility in which the students could ask and answer questions about one another's daily lives. </p> <p>A second project was soon started with a school in the Alexandra township, which was supplied with 12 computers paid for by Research Machines and freighted free by British Airways. In their first topic, Me and My World, youngsters from John Cabot and the township started exchanging information about themselves, their hobbies, families and schools. </p> <p>As a result, Singh has found himself during holidays over the past two years going to Alexandra with a project partnered by the Metropolitan Police, British Airways and Charlton football club to train police cadets there to run citizenship workshops in order to bring them closer to their communities. </p> <p>\"Baldev is an exceptionally talented teacher who has the ability to bring the best out in individuals,\" says Mary Berry, BA's community learning coordinator. \"His awareness of cultural diversity and his ability to work on a range of complex social issues in an alien environment was remarkable.\" </p> <p>The Jordan trip was as a consultant for Microsoft, advising the Jordanian education ministry on the design of its new ICT curriculum. The Cairo trip was on behalf of the British Council and was again concerned with the training of teachers. </p> <p>He has brought his research skills with him into school. His constant experiments with the effects of new technology on education and learning have earned Singh a visiting research fellowship from Bristol University. </p> <p>Despite all this, \"he retains the essential quality of humility that enables him to interact with young people, getting down to their level, exciting and motivating them as only a really gifted teacher can,\" says Jim Wynn, Microsoft's school strategy manager. </p> <p>Singh has stopped teaching biology and is now head of ICT in the school. \"It's been an exciting journey. It doesn't feel like work,\" he says. \"I got into teaching reasonably late and it's all fresh because I am learning. What's interesting for me is this concept of a borderless classroom. You allow the young people to experience the world outside the four walls.\" </p> <p>Information technology is developing every month. The kids sometimes know more than the teachers, he says. \"I see my role as a teacher as changing. You're more of a gatekeeper to this world of information.\" </p> <p><strong>The results</strong>.</p> <p><strong> The judges say </strong> </p> <p>\"[He] creates a climate for learning that is characterised by enthusiasm in the classroom, high expectations and outstanding results ...

  "<p>Rupert Murdoch has claimed his Fox News channel is not biased in favour of George Bush and that News Corporation, his global media empire, is a \"fair and balanced\" company. </p> <p>Speaking at the company's annual general meeting in Adelaide, Mr Murdoch insisted Fox News' reporting was more balanced than that of other US networks. </p> <p>\"It's full of Democrats and Republicans, the others only have Democrats.

  "<p>You can call it an estate car if you like, but people in the know prefer to think of it as a BMW 5 Series Touring, with the emphasis on the \"Touring\". Who can blame them? We all know, deep down, that the word \"estate\", when appended to the name of a car, tends to come across like a sigh of resignation, interchangeable with other words such as \"compromise\" and \"sensible\". </p> <p>\"Touring\", on the other hand, appears to have something of the alpine air in its hair. It smacks of freedom, the open road, baggage-free adventure in unchartered regions, and all those other things one has generally drawn a thick line under by the time one buys an estate car. In a BMW 5 Series, we are not merely going to the dump to dispose of our sacks of garden waste - we are touring. </p> <p>OK, so it's not a perfect verbal fit. But we need a term to set this sophisticated and life-enhancing slab of German engineering apart from all those other cars with big boots. \"Touring\" will have to do. </p> <p>It's not often an estate car shows any interest in gladdening the heart. Most of them are too busy fulfilling their roles as glorified wheelbarrows to have time for flirtation and witty repartee. As long as they have seats and a steering wheel, stop and start when told to, and come with a tailgate that doesn't take your head off on the way up, nobody much complains. </p> <p>The 5 Series, however, even while boasting a load-space of 500 litres and enough airbags to quiet the most eagerly cosseting parent, generously and heroically retains at least a vestigial interest in stirring your soul, or regions thereabouts. This is partly a matter of the car's undeniably dinky body panels - a sexy arrangement of convex and concave surfaces in the new, rather superior BMW style. (It seems to be the mission of all new generation BMWs to resemble, in so far as is possible within EU regulations, the Batmobile.) </p> <p>Couple this with the way the tailgate folds around into the sides of the car and it is fairly clear that we are not merely looking at a saloon on to the back of which someone has hammered a tea chest. Still more engaging is the confidence-inducing way in which the car handles - by no means a given in a vehicle roughly the shape and length of a hearse. I drove an automatic 530d - the turbo-charged, three-litre diesel version - which was so frugal it almost seemed embarrassed about asking me for fuel, yet which, at the same time, gave that sense one gets from a good BMW saloon that one is driving a spongier, more buttock-pampering sports car. </p> <p>The refinements in this case are BMW's Dynamic Drive system, some electronic stabilising gear (first used on the 7 Series), and active steering that alters the amount of tug needed to work the steering wheel in relation to the speed at which the car is travelling. The combined effect of these gizmos makes it possible to motor unflinchingly through sharp corners without necessarily having to see, in your wing-mirror, the unnerving sight of your own rear end pulling out to overtake you. </p> <p>The car is now in its third generation, and, in keeping with broader developments in the evolution of motoring, the new model is taller, wider and longer than the outgoing one, and therefore potentially just that little bit more difficult to park. That said, mine came with BMW's parking distance control system. </p> <p>The system is both audio and visual, with a colour diagram appearing on the central screen on the dashboard, showing the car surrounded by a range of zones, darkening from green to red as those menacing stationary objects grow nearer. Meanwhile a bleeper gibbers away with increasing nervousness. (Contrast the soothing, almost therapeutic harp sound the car makes when you attempt to leave it without switching its headlights off.) </p> <p>What with the general sense of electronically generated panic, it is a bit like being beckoned into a space by Corporal Jones from Dad's Army. My feeling, having tested the system extensively in a city environment, is that if you trusted completely in the PDC's paranoid verdict on what constitutes too close for comfort, you would never find a space big enough to park in and would be forced to drive around in circles until you ran out of petrol. </p> <p>Fortunately, there is an off-button on the dashboard for anyone willing to fly solo and help revive the ancient and increasingly neglected art of reverse-parking in urban conditions. </p> <p>The interior of the BMW 5 Series Touring, as is traditional with the company, takes the form of a small symposium on leather and ergonomics. Even the boot has been expensively upholstered. </p> <p>It was with some guilt that I put a dog in it. And it was with some reluctance that the dog eventually returned to live in the house. But that is the Touring lifestyle. It gets a hold on you and won't let go. </p> <p><strong>The lowdown</strong><br>BMW 530d Touring</p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> \u00a333,930 <br><strong>Top speed:</strong> 151mph <br><strong>Acceleration:</strong> 0-62mph in 7.4 seconds <br><strong>Consumption:</strong> 39.2mpg (combined) <br><strong>At the wheel:</strong> Boswell <br><strong>On the stereo:</strong> BBC Radio 6 <br><strong>En route for:</strong> The Western Isles</p>",

  "Oil giant BP today posted record profits of $3.94bn (\u00a32.14bn) after fuel prices hit new highs. <p>The third quarter performance of Britain's biggest listed company came as oil prices rose to an average of almost $50 a barrel.</p> <p>Because of the importance of refining and marketing, high oil prices do not always guarantee BP huge profits. Today the firm thanked \"strong global demand\" for refinery products such as petrol and diesel. Marketing profits were also up.</p> <p>BP said the loss of production in the United States following Hurricane Ivan, low inventories and limited spare capacity had underpinned the rising price of crude oil. </p> <p>The profits figure for the period between July and September - which amounts to around \u00a31m an hour - includes exceptional costs of $401m, linked to environmental clean-up and other charges. </p> <p>BP said profits in the first nine months of the year were 26% higher than a year ago at $12.56bn. </p> <p>The firm's chief executive, Lord Browne, warned that the highs were not likely to go on indefinitely with signs of slowdown in Asia and sluggish economies in Europe. </p> <p>However he said: \"This has been another strong performance against the backdrop of strong global demand.\" </p> <p>There was a 30% improvement in profits from exploration and production as BP reaped further benefits from its links with Russian oil group TNK. </p> <p>Refining margins slipped back from record levels in the second quarter but remained high due to strong growth in demand and low stocks, BP said. </p> <p>Lord Browne said the group was on track to hit its investment targets and use spare cash to buy back more of its own shares. </p> <p>Economic recovery in the United States appeared to have gathered speed in the third quarter, but Europe was failing to keep pace, he said. \"The outlook for the rest of 2004 will depend upon the rate of US production recovery after Hurricane Ivan and the strength of oil demand growth,\" Lord Browne said.</p> <p>Political stability in oil-producing nations and decision-making by oil cartel Opec also had the potential to force fuel prices higher, he added. </p> <p>BP told investors that the weakness of the US dollar meant it would spend more money on infrastructure next year than previously thought. Capital expenditure in 2005 is expected to match the $14bn the firm is spending this year.</p>",
  "Lobbying companies and international investment banks played a big role in persuading the government to create a market for 24-hour casinos. <p>Ministers and MPs have been lobbied by the big players from Britain, the United States, South Africa and Australia. Worldwide players include the South African-owned Sun International; Las Vegas-based Caesars Entertainment ; MGM Mirage, the US and Australian-based casino operators; and Kerzner International, another US operator. </p> <p>Many of the companies have used two or three lobbyists. One lobbying company, Quintus, ran half-day training programmes for executives from three of the biggest gaming companies on how to present their case to MPs and ministers. </p> <p>Caesars Entertainment used them for the training and then employed Citigate Public Affairs, itself one of the big London lobbyists, to push their case with ministers. </p> <p>One bank, CIBC, organised two private meetings with the Department for Culture for representatives of the casino industry. The bank also hosted a conference in New York last year to discuss worldwide investment opportunities and developing new markets. It financed the $1bn Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City with MGM Mirage, the first new casino to open in Atlantic City in 13 years. </p> <p>The big casinos have found allies in local government to argue that expanding the gambling industry will attract more tourists to declining resorts such as Blackpool and Great Yarmouth to provide a source of new employment in the inner cities and rundown shopping centres. </p> <p>Lobbyists have benefited from the decision of the government last year to set up a joint committee of the Commons and Lords to examine the case for a draft gambling bill which allowed companies a clear run for a year to influence parliament. MPs and peers on the committee - 14 of the 16 of whom have interests in gambling industry, from the Tote to London Clubs International, which operates casinos across the world - have been inundated with invitations to meet lobbyists. </p> <p>The chairman of the committee, John Greenway, Conservative MP for Ryedale, who is paid \u00a310,000 a year as an adviser to College Hill, consultants to the Tote, is a contender to head the Gambling Commission, which will regulate the new casinos. </p> <p>Alan Meale, Labour MP for Mansfield and a member of the committee, who has a share in a racehorse, said the lobbying had been incredibly aggressive. \"Every week I was being bombarded by lobbyists representing various gaming companies who wanted to see me. Some have been really cheeky. One today managed to persuade my secretary that I had agreed to an appointment. I had it struck out.\" </p> <p>The lobbying companies' thrust is that an expansion of casinos in an adult, crime-free environment will attract punters, create jobs and encourage gamblers to stay in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>Halloween and its fearsome ghouls may be just around the corner, but a group of MPs did not need paranormal help this week to scare the government into action on science and international development.</p> <p>In a report published today, MPs on the Commons science and technology committee take the Department for International Development (DfID) to task over the way it uses and commissions science. The report could have been worse, however, had the department not taken action when it realised it was in for a rough ride.</p> <p>The committee started its inquiry into science and international development in January. At an early stage it detected in its witnesses frustration at the way the DfID handled its science procurement. The most unforgiving was John Lawton, chief executive of the Natural Environment Research Council, who accused the department of being \"complacent, rather arrogant and ill-informed\".</p> <p>He said: \"At the moment they are rebuilding on the Mozambique flood plain, in an area which was devastated, without asking whether it is going to flood again. And the answer is yes, it is. It is a huge waste of taxpayers' money. The fact that they are not getting the advice, not even asking for it in the most elementary and strategic way, I think is scandalous.\"</p> <p>Hearing such incendiary evidence, the committee's Labour chair, Ian Gibson, promised something \"as sharp as the Medical Research Council report\" for the DfiD. The comment referred to a report last year that had accused the MRC of mismanaging its funds.</p> <p>The thought of receiving the same treatment as the research council seemed to scare the DfID into action. Before parliament rose for its summer break, it had produced a new research strategy and proclaimed it was going to hire a chief scientific adviser (having been one of the few government departments not to have done so).</p> <p>Moreover, in the summer, its science budget was raised by a quarter, from \u00a380m to at least \u00a3100m a year from 2006-07. The DfID will also set up a group to bring together government departments, research councils and the private sector to coordinate science and international development.</p> <p>With its expanded budget, the DfID's research spending will focus on four themes: productivity in African agriculture; killer diseases such as HIV/Aids, malaria and TB; getting countries working in the interest of the poor; and climate change. In some of its work, it will collaborate with the Wellcome Trust, Britain's biggest charity, which will commit about \u00a310m of its own money towards malaria research with the department. The DfID is also exploring how to increase the capacity for health research in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>But the DfID's new research strategy only sets out its priorities for the next three years. This is a short time for any strategy, especially one that hopes to inspire more long-term thinking. In the long term, the DfID says it will be basing its science procurement on its Millennium Goals, which aim, for example, to halve the number of extremely poor people and achieve universal primary education by 2015.</p> <p>Researchers are happy to work towards ambitious goals, but what really matters to them is that there is continuity in the funding.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Linda Nordling is a reporter on Research Fortnight. <a href=\"mailto:ln@researchresearch.com\">ln@researchresearch.com</a></p>",
  "<p>From his campus office atop the hills surrounding the New Zealand capital, Paul Morris beholds a panoramic view. It's a picture-perfect morning at the Victoria University of Wellington, and the city's immense harbour lies flat as a tabletop, gleaming and sparkling under a blue southern hemisphere sky. In the far distance, a cruiseliner chugs across the waters, and in the sky the sun hangs like a picturesque lemon.</p> <p>\"You wouldn't mistake this for Birmingham now, would you?\" the British-born professor of religious studies says with a chuckle.</p> <p>Everyday scenes like these were what spurred Morris, who was born in Southampton and taught for a decade at the University of Lancaster, to decamp for the antipodes in the late 1980s. It was to be a decision the 50-year-old would not regret. Although he still visits his homeland each year \"for the intellectual climate\", he sees little chance of any permanent relocation.</p> <p>Morris is one of a growing number of foreign-born scholars opting for an academic life in the South Seas. While exact numbers are hard to quantify, departmental resumes and anecdotal reports suggest the trend is steadily upward. International security concerns, New Zealand's attractions as a relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly place to raise families, and the country's recent efforts to fashion its eight universities into more research-friendly institutions of higher learning are all part of the new professional allure of this South Pacific island nation of 4 million people.</p> <p>What's more, the New Zealand education system, which draws on both the English and Scottish models, makes the country \"a very recognisable setting for British academics\", says Morris. And, adds Brenda Porter, a British-born professor of accounting who is head of Victoria's school of accounting and commercial law, even the lower salaries seem less of an obstacle now than they were in the years before 2003, when she resigned her position as a reader in accounting at the Warwick business school.</p> <p>Allowing for the relative cost of living, she says, reflecting on her time at Warwick and as director of accounting research at Cranfield University, \"there's no question in my mind that most academic salaries here are better. And more than that, there just isn't the same squeeze on budgets. There aren't the restrictions on attending conferences and so forth that you'd find at some British universities.\"</p> <p>Of course, salary packages at British institutions are known to be famously tight-fisted. This is not the case at the leading American universities, however - but even here some recent arrivals to New Zealand are beginning to draw favourable comparisons.</p> <p>Elizabeth Styron is one such newcomer. A 27-year-old fine arts graduate from the University of Virginia with a strong literary background - the novelist William Styron, author of Sophie's Choice, is a relative - she first came to New Zealand in 2001, on a Fulbright scholarship to pursue graduate research at Victoria in her specialist area of creating digital copies of scholarly and classic books.</p> <p>The university went on to offer her the inaugural directorship of its New Zealand electronic text centre, which opened in 2002 and is styled after similar centres at the University of New Brunswick, in Canada, and Australia's University of Sydney, along with Styron's own alma mater.</p> <p>Today, the New Zealand centre has established a searchable electronic archive of colonial texts and writings from the 19th century, when New Zealand was founded by its erstwhile British overlords. The new centre has made available digital copies of the early writings of authors such as Katherine Mansfield, the logbooks of the explorer James Cook, and other texts no longer covered by copyright.</p> <p>\"In New Zealand,\" says Styron, \"you can have more of an impact, enjoy a greater breadth of experience and just generally do your own thing.\" In terms of annual salary, she calculates she currently makes \"at least\" as much as she would have commanded at this point in her career if she had remained in the same line of research work in the United States - around $50,000 (\u00a327,700).</p> <p>In Britain, a small number of her counterparts may earn more, \"but as far as I can tell they tend to be older guys who have reached the top of the totem pole in places like Oxford,\" she says.</p> <p>\"All of that said, it's much more difficult to get funding or grant money here than it is in the States, which is definitely frustrating. But on balance, I still prefer the experience that's available to me here.\"</p> <p>Would she consider going to Britain? \"Probably not. In the US, I was relatively junior, and that would have been even more true in Britain, but here I enjoy the space and impact of somebody much senior.\"</p> <p>The drawbacks? \"Institutions here struggle. Academic institutions in New Zealand, I like to say, operate in the spirit of a business but the efficiency of a university, which is the opposite of the US.\" Sometimes, too, the \"cultural asphyxiation\" of working in a small intellectual environment can weigh heavily. \"Now and then it really does feel like the end of the world.\"</p> <p>For Paul Morris, and others, even the smallness of the antipodean scholarly climate can be sort of beautiful. In his more poetic moments, he likens his parent institution to the \"University of Middle Earth\", a reference to Wellington's role in providing the setting for the recent Lord of the Rings films.</p> <p>\"There's a cache of magic here, a sense of new possibilities,\" says Morris. All the same, he admits, \"there will always be real advantages in Britain in terms of libraries, professional associations and so forth, which I miss\".</p> <p>Then he sneaks another satisfied glance out of the office window.</p>",
  "<p>Listening to Sir Peter Maxwell-Davies describing the difficulties audiences and performers had when engaging with \"modern\" music during the middle of the last century caused me to reflect on the similarities with those who now engage with new methods of teaching. Maxwell-Davies explained that, with the loss of the familiar structure and tonality of music, performers and listeners found it difficult to determine the nature and meaning of the pieces they were performing or hearing.</p> <p>Similarly, the nature of learning and teaching is changing - teachers are being encouraged to design a curriculum to meet the needs of the learner. Individual learning places the teacher at the centre not of a single model, but 20 to 30 models of learning, depending on the size of the class.</p> <p>To devise a curriculum that responds to individual needs requires detailed knowledge of the subject matter and a clear understanding of the pedagogy required. Here we lose the familiar structure of the curriculum that takes the learner through repeated patterns, much the same as the modern composers of the 20th century lost the regularity of the four-bar phrase.</p> <p>Neither learning nor music happens in isolation: the environment has a major impact on individuals engaged in either activity. Where schools can be re-engineered to accommodate the broader, more varied curriculum that accommodates the academic, social and vocational needs of individuals, there is every opportunity the learner will achieve. However, if the physical structure of the school prevents the learner or teacher from achieving the aims and objectives of the curriculum, little will be gained from a new initiative.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the need for many schools to be rebuilt, there is the capacity for the majority to be refurbished in order to accommodate the new curriculum. The time is here for architects and teachers to discuss the redesign of schools.</p> <p>Beyond this, staff will need to be trained to develop the appropriate skills. Teachers know that competencies can become obsolete; however, educators must produce something that is strong enough to achieve a balanced understanding of individual learners.</p> <p>Teachers are aware of the impact of personal computers on the learner. The internet provides a model for individual learning. However, computers can be isolating.</p> <p>The social element of schools that prepares learners for society remains constant through the changes that challenge our thoughts. Maxwell-Davies also placed an emphasis on the social importance of music. It can provide the opportunity for people to interact.</p> <p>Irrespective of curriculum content or style of delivery, there is an ethical, values-led purpose to education. As we move into the next dimension of curriculum development, the importance of retaining the integrity and professional standing of education remains central to all our endeavours as learners and teachers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is the last in the series of Master class.

  "<p>It's been quite a summer for Guy Wilkins. First, he and his son were struck by lightning while taking part in a sailing competition in Ireland. He then took the family on holiday to Boscastle in Cornwall, only to find himself marooned by floods. And when he got home, he had to go into hospital to have a malignant melanoma removed from his right thigh. </p> <p>To round it off, there were the Teaching Awards. \"I didn't even know I'd been nominated and I felt really stressed out when I discovered I'd been shortlisted for the regional prize,\" he says. \"I asked the head not to tell other members of staff, but she said it was too late.\" </p> <p>The atmosphere wasn't that much better at home. \"My wife is also a teacher,\" he laughs, \"and when I came home that evening and told her about the nomination, her immediate reply was that she had had a terrible day at work. So it seemed like a good idea not to go too overboard. The joke is that I reckon she's actually a far better teacher than me; it's just that I have a far higher profile in the borough.\" </p> <p>It's a profile that's about to get a great deal higher, for Wilkins didn't just win the regional award for excellence in special needs teaching, he's also picked up the overall national prize. Not that you can see it changing him too much. </p> <p>Wilkins started work in a Bromley all-boys comprehensive as a 21-year-old straight out of teacher training college. Twenty-three years down the line, he is still working in the borough of Kent, though for the past 11 years he has been the PE teacher at the Marjorie McClure special school in Chislehurst, where the 85 or so kids range in age from five to 19. </p> <p>\"The children vary tremendously in their disabilities,\" he says. \"Some have hearing difficulties, while others suffer from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. At least once every two years we have a funeral - you try not to let it get to you too much and celebrate what the child has done, but it's hard not to get emotional as you've often formed a tremendously close relationship with the children and their parents.\" </p> <p>It was almost by chance that Wilkins started working at Marjorie McClure. He had been happy teaching in mainstream schools and it had never occurred to him to make the switch, until the then head invited him in for a chat and twisted his arm into taking the job. </p> <p>\"I've always been strong on competitive sports,\" Wilkins admits, \"and the head said he was keen to foster that attitude. He also told me I could pick up what I needed to know about special needs teaching along the way.\" </p> <p>His first sports day, in the summer of 1993, went down a storm, and he's never looked back. \"My philosophy has always been to get the children to reach the limits of their potential,\" he says. \"I get as much pleasure from seeing Dominic [son of the boxer Nigel Benn] get picked for the England cerebral palsy soccer team as from seeing someone put their head under the water in the hydrotherapy pool and come up smiling for the first time.\" </p> <p>In most mainstream schools, PE comes a poor second in the timetable. At Marjorie McClure, it is central. \"PE makes a real difference to the children's lives,\" says Wilkins. \"Not only does it extend their range of physical movement and improve their coordination, it also plays a vital role in building up their confidence. This has real knock-on benefits for their academic work.\" </p> <p>No child is ever excluded. If they can't play, they can blow a whistle to referee. And if they can't do that, they can evaluate the performance of other kids. Over the years, Wilkins has extended the range of activities. The core work is done in the pool and in the gym, but there are also now opportunities for soccer, wheelchair slalom, zone hockey, boccia, snooker, sailing, tag rugby and dance. </p> <p>Along the way, Wilkins has also extended himself: he has had to get up to speed on ICT, as visual aids are a vital learning resource for children with disabilities. He also found himself early on part of the management team. He says it was useful to be involved in planning the school's strategic future. But it's not hard to see that at heart he is happiest when he's doing something, and it was clearly no hardship when he had to give up his management position for other responsibilities. </p> <p>These days it's hard to find a pie Wilkins doesn't have a finger in. He's an advanced skills teacher doing outreach work in five mainstream primary schools; he regularly supervises students from Greenwich University's teacher training scheme on their school visits; he fronts the Bromley play leader scheme; and, as the hub for the local schools sports partnership, he has access to previously unavailable cash. </p> <p>\"You may be surprised to know that I have little expertise in dance,\" he smiles, \"so I've now been able to buy in two dance teachers for the school. The kids love it.\" </p> <p>Wilkins is a man in perpetual motion. Over the course of the hour I spend with him, we move from front office to gym, to kitchen, to rear office and back to the main hall, as he checks to make sure a conference is running smoothly. </p> <p>But it's the children who are his real motivation. \"I want to get each child to believe that he or she can, metaphorically, fly,\" he says. \"I told my wife that if I ever had to have my leg amputated, I'd enter the paralympics.\" Somehow you can't help believing him. </p> <p><strong> The judges say</strong> </p> <p>\"Guy Wilkins' work exemplifies the sort of effective inclusion and cooperation between mainstream and special schools that is much written about but not often seen.\" </p> <p><strong> Regional winners</strong> </p> <p>Karen Scott, Queensmead infant school (East Midlands); Jean Howlett, Spring Common school (east); Guy Wilkins, Marjorie McClure school (London); Linda Collingwood, Grove Road primary school (London); Stephen Powell, Raincliffe school (north); Helene Podmore, Hob Moor Oaks school (north); Brenda Crossthwaite, Trafford sensory impairment support service (north west); Joy Wright, Eccles College (north west); Alan Jennings, Ashfield boys high school (Northern Ireland); Jean Cooper, St Margarets CE first &amp; middle school (south east); Sandra Wylie, the Mary Hare grammar school for the deaf (south); Paul Daniel, Queen Mary's College (south); Janice Ward, Stoke Damerel primary school (south west); Sue Icke, Hob Green primary school (West Midlands); Hilary Eyley, Corsham primary school (west)</p>",
  "<p>Beneath the leaden sky of a Wednesday afternoon, Alder Grange high school huddles up against the dour landscape of the Rossendale countryside, a corner of Lancashire famed for slipper manufacturing, coconut dancers, and now for Iain Hulland, winner of the Promethean award for headteacher of the year. </p> <p>This particular Wednesday afternoon, Hulland finds himself in the school library, where pupils of assorted ages and sizes are surfing the internet and wrestling with the complexities of their homework. Amid the chatter and the page-turning, the headteacher unceremoniously plonks himself down on the beanbags and begins unravelling a particularly sticky mathematical conundrum with one of his students. </p> <p>This is typical of Hulland, who belongs to a very hands-on breed of headteacher. When Alder Grange was buried beneath a sudden snowstorm and cars were having difficulty crawling down the icy slope from the school, Hulland joined the caretaker, knuckling down to shift the snow and grit the road in his best suit and a pair of wellington boots. He shakes his head at the suggestion that he was in any way heroic. \"Well, a good suit got ruined,\" he grins, \"but everyone got home safely.\" </p> <p>Hulland came to the school 15 years ago as deputy head, having taught history and politics at a large and bustling comprehensive in nearby Burnley. \"When I joined Alder Grange, it was a school with a big heart,\" he says generously. In fact, the school, where 50% of students are from deprived areas, did not have a gleaming reputation and was struggling to fill its 450 places. Today, thanks to Hulland, it has been transformed into a specialist technology college with more than 650 pupils. Each year, 230 applicants jostle for the school's 120 places. So what magic has Hulland wrought? </p> <p>\"Both my predecessors under whom I served as deputy head were very different people with different ways of doing things, but our core values are exactly the same,\" he says, keen to stress that really, he has merely continued to carry the flag. </p> <p>\"I think that's one of the reasons the school has been able to make the progress that it has ... Don [the first head] got us this building, really, and placed the emphasis on people. Then Jean [Hulland's immediate predecessor] brought another type of hard-edged thinking - upping the ante when it came to raising levels of attainment across the board. And I ...\" he looks around the room, self-consciously, and fiddles with his coffee cup. \"I don't know what I do, really, when it comes to it.\" </p> <p>Where Hulland is concerned, it's more: what doesn't he do? His ceaseless fundraising succeeded in getting the \u00a350,000 sponsorship required to convert Alder Grange into a specialist school. More recently, he secured the finance for a new sports hall by organising a joint bid with three other local schools. Under his stewardship, Alder Grange has become one of only six schools involved in the Design Council's renaissance project, which works to find better-designed learning resources; has gained \"leading edge\" status, and has twice been cited for outstanding progress between Ofsted reports. </p> <p>He can, say his pupils, make a perfect Pot Noodle; he knows his students by name; and, even if it is the middle of the night, he will open up the school to welcome them back from trips abroad. This is a head who, as he strolls along the corridors, holds open doors for his pupils. </p> <p>It's hardly surprising that the students have flourished in this environment. \"It's fair to say,\" admits Hulland, \"that youngsters are achieving below national levels when they join us and actually achieving above national levels when they leave us. But it's striking a balance between allowing youngsters to achieve more, but without becoming an exam factory.\" </p> <p>His mantra is that Alder Grange is about developing the whole child: \"We look at their physical development; their social, moral, cultural development; their creativity, their spirituality, the whole balance,\" he explains. \"The challenge is to, quite rightly, look at their academic attainment, while not forgetting that each one of these young folks is an individual worth nurturing.\" </p> <p>This attitude tallies sweetly with Hulland's twinkling vision for the school. \"Two or three years back, we had a thorough look at what it was the school was about,\" he says, \"and out of that came a values and aims document which identifies what it is that we're looking to do to contribute to the growth of the whole child and parents and staff, and what it is we're aiming to do to contribute to the wider community. Every section of the school community was involved in devising it, and it is the starting point of absolutely everything we do.\" </p> <p>Hulland's belief in eking out the talent and the passions that lie in every single pupil - be they for handball or music or literature - perhaps nod to his own schooling. He wasn't, he claims, a particularly brilliant student, but a keen rugby player who dreamed of becoming a pilot, and who somehow fell into teaching when his wife told him she didn't want him to go back into the armed forces. </p> <p>His tirelessly positive and committed attitude has led to Hulland being highly regarded by the local community, for having encouraged links with local industry and community schemes, and for his sheer acts of compassion: when an elderly man had his allotment vandalised, for example, Hulland rallied a team of students to clear it up. \"I don't think I have ever met a more equitable person,\" wrote one member of staff in the award nomination. </p> <p>Visitors to the school are greeted by billows of warmth and enthusiasm from the staff, the pupils and Hulland himself, and when the judges for the Teaching Awards arrived at Alder Grange it was no different - 40 parents flocked to the gates to tell them just how adored Hulland is, an inspector from the Ofsted team made a 600-mile round-trip to support the nomination, and the chair of governors found himself too emotional to speak. </p> <p>The students, too, wanted to have their tuppence happ'worth on the subject of their most extraordinary headteacher: \"I just wanted to show my appreciation through this letter,\" one student wrote, \"to give a little back in return for the vast amount I have received ... It is your contribution which I will never forget or cease to be grateful for.\" </p> <p> <strong> The judges say</strong> </p> <p>\"The view of all associated with the school is that Iain Hulland has been the key to its transformation ... We were indeed convinced that this headteacher stood out as special.\" </p> <p><strong> Regional winners</strong> </p> <p>Sally Bates, Albany infant and nursery school (East Midlands); Jay Henderson, Chaulden junior school (east); Pritpal Singh, Drayton Manor high school (London); Janet Moffat Melcombe primary school (London); Kevin McDermid, Usworth school (north east &amp; Cumbria); Tricia Campbell, Town Field primary school (north); Brendan Duffy, St Patrick's VA RC primary school (north west); Iain Hulland, Alder Grange high school (north west); Jean Cook, Kirkham Pear Tree school (north west); Neil Downing, Dungannon primary school (Northern Ireland); Wendy Carey, Tonbridge grammar school (south east); David Akers, Budmouth technology college (south); Bunty McCormack, St Joseph's Catholic primary school (south); Anthony Alexander, Exmouth community college (south west); Clive Hampton, Eirias high school (Wales); Carol Parker, Cwmaman infant school (Wales); David Seddon, Baxter College (West Midlands); Ray Priest, City Academy Bristol (west); Jacquie Coulby, Batheaston CE primary school (west)</p>",
  "<p>In the English department at Ridgeway school in Plympton, Plymouth, alongside the displays of work on the walls, there is a more unusual exhibit. A huge picture-board shows an African building in a sorry state of repair - and the improvements wrought by an energetic group of Ridgeway pupils, led by an even more energetic teacher, now the 2004 winner of the award for school and community involvement. </p> <p>Ridgeway pupils first discovered Dzalanyama school, in Malawi, when a sixth-form group went on an expedition there in 2003. Part of the trip involved working with local people and the students were shocked at the miserable facilities in the school. Back home, English teacher Claire Davidson, who led the expedition, swung into action. </p> <p>She galvanised the whole school to raise funds. Efforts included a talent show, a pantomime, a sponsored abseil, plus countless individual projects involving dog-walking, car-washing and one enterprising pupil who ran round a local park in her pyjamas. Fundraising has now reached \u00a35,500 and plans are well under way to refurbish Dzalanyama school's dilapidated plumbing and convert a disused barn into a dormitory. The website Davidson has set up, <a href=\"http://www.malawiproject.net\">www.malawiproject.net</a>, details progress so far. </p> <p>Dzalanyama school isn't the only project to benefit from Davidson's involvement. Her tutor group has raised money for Jubilee Action, a group that fights child prostitution in developing countries. She brought colleagues and senior girls together to run the Race for Life to raise money to combat breast cancer, and supported the Devon Air Ambulance. She ran the school's cross-country club for nine years, and has organised music and creative writing residential workshops for pupils. Oh, and in her spare time, she runs marathons. </p> <p>Davidson, 36, is not only dedicated to community projects, but is also an exceptional teacher, says headteacher John Didymus. \"Claire teaches 23 out of the week's 25 lessons, she is second in her department, and she teaches every year from 7 to 13, as well as being a form tutor. It's well recognised that she is an outstanding teacher, and she receives regular accolades from parents and colleagues alike.\" </p> <p>What sets her apart, he says, is her energy: \"It's difficult to define, but it permeates across the school. She acts as a catalyst for other people. Claire is passionate about the way children can influence what goes on around them, whether it's a local charity or a global effect. Although she has the esteem of students and staff, she is self-effacing. She just wants to make a difference.\" </p> <p>She was nominated for her award by Sinead McEwan, a year 13 pupil studying for her A-levels at Ridgeway. Davidson has been Sinead's English teacher or form tutor almost every year since she joined the school. \"Claire is a really good teacher,\" says Sinead. \"She interacts with us; she doesn't use posh language. She doesn't tell us what to think. It's not just about you respecting your teacher, it's about your teacher respecting you, and that's what she does. </p> <p>\"I wanted to show people what she has done. When we went out to Malawi, there was no glass in the school windows, there were wasps' nests in the classroom, the toilets were indescribable. We were really able to make a difference and the school is still involved. Claire really deserves the award for the amount of free time she puts in.\" </p> <p>Amazingly, Davidson never wanted to be a teacher - she aspired to journalism - and her first experiences at the front of the classroom nearly put her off completely. When she was studying for her degree in French and English, she spent a year working as a language assistant in Toulouse. Being left in charge of classes of 30 pupils as an inexperienced 20-year-old was a baptism of fire that nearly robbed the teaching profession of a bright star. </p> <p>\"I fell into teaching by chance,\" she explains. \"My boyfriend, now my husband, moved to Plymouth and so I looked for a career I could follow in the south-west.\" Her enthusiasm was kindled first by teaching English as a foreign language and then by her experience qualifying as a teacher: \"I was lucky, my teaching practice was at a very good comprehensive and I had a fantastic mentor.\" </p> <p>It was again a happy chance that led her to Ridgeway. \"I was asked to come in for two months on a temporary contract to cover a sick leave. And I'm still here, 11-and-a-half years later. It sounds a bit cheesy but I'm so happy here.\" She has no plans to move on. </p> <p>But she did change direction. \"When I started taking groups on expeditions in 1999, I expected it to have a massive impact on the kids, but it had a similar effect on me,\" she says. \"Before I went, I was thinking that I ought to be more ambitious, be looking for the next step, be pursuing a head of department post.\" </p> <p>But the success of the trips made her realise community action was her real ambition. \"I take my English teaching very seriously, but alongside it I can focus on where my other interests lie: community work and leadership projects.\" The pupils who went back to Dzalanyama for a second visit this summer were so confident, she says, they were largely able to work without adult supervision. </p> <p>For someone who has clearly had such a major impact on her school, Davidson is remarkably modest. \"There is something quite embarrassing about being singled out,\" she says. \"There are tons of brilliant teachers in this school and all our projects are team efforts. An award should be viewed as a thank you for the whole school.\" </p> <p><strong>The results</strong></p> <p> <strong> The judges say</strong> </p> <p>\"On the face of it, this nomination appears to be centred on one overseas project - but do not be fooled. Whilst this project looms large in the nomination and the school, it has rippled throughout the community _ in fact, all that this teacher comes into contact with, both directly and indirectly.\" </p> <p><strong> Regional winners</strong> </p> <p>Avis Fawcitt, Humberstone junior school (East Midlands); Wanda Noakes, Southend pupil referral unit (east); Gill Mallard, Pickhurst infant school (London); Melanie Lyons, Ferryhill school (north east); Sheila Ralph, Dinnington primary school (north); Andrew Nicholson, Garstang high school (north west); Eunan O'Donnell, Steelstown primary school (Northern Ireland); Malcolm Deacon, Siskin junior school (south); Claire Davidson, Ridgeway school (south west); Sue Davies, Pen-y-dre high school (Wales); Sue Southam, Guilsfield primary school (Wales)</p>",

Butterworth echoes the plotline of Romeo and Juliet, with an appendix in which the banished cats return with kittens. The rat, who, arguably, has been the cause of near tragedy, scarpers. Bravely, Butterworth does not allow him to reform. That would weaken a powerful story, pointedly dedicated to Desmond Tutu.</p> <p>Helen Cooper's story is equally potent.

  "<p>There are more black and ethnic minority students in higher education than ever before: 250,000 at the last count, comprising one in eight of all home students. That is a real success story. These students have shown ambition and tenacity in getting to university.</p> <p>But, despite the achievements of so many, there is still a long way to go before British universities fully represent the communities they serve. A particular challenge faces us in the case of young black men of African-Caribbean origin. As Trevor Phillips of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) has pointed out, more young black men enter prison each year than enter university. It is a shocking statistic that raises important issues for universities, as well as posing challenges for the penal system and our schools.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons why it is important that universities should tackle exclusion. Doing so has a direct impact on those groups that are excluded, of course, especially as education is the key to later employment opportunities. Missing out on education can mean disadvantage all the way down the line. Educational inclusiveness will create more black and Asian achievers in education and the world of work, providing positive models of success to influence the next generation.</p> <p>Seeking diversity makes business sense for universities. In a competitive market, they want to attract the widest possible range of applicants. A broad ethnic mix benefits the university community as well as social cohesion. One of the strengths of a university education is the opportunity to mix with a range of people, and research by the CRE has shown this is a vital factor in better race relations.</p> <p>Inclusiveness is important for the nation, too, as we need to make use of all available talent and not waste the potential of significant groups. For all these reasons, when particular categories of the population fall behind their peers we need to intervene when we can.</p> <p>At school age, the ambition of ethnic minority pupils is encouraging. More of them aspire to university than their white classmates - eight in 10 say they are likely to study for a degree, compared with fewer than seven in 10 white pupils, according to recent research by the Sutton Trust using the Mori schools omnibus.</p> <p>Clearly, not all of them make it. But some groups, such as Indian and Chinese students, are over-represented compared with their numbers in the population, and many others are holding their own.</p> <p>A significant minority of universities has very diverse student populations. Some interesting alternative \"league tables\" have been created by Hobsons, the student recruitment marketing and management specialists, using figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). Westminster, South Bank, Middlesex and Thames Valley universities top the rankings, with the highest populations of home ethnic minority students. At my university, Greenwich, over half the home students on our largest campus are from ethnic minorities (52%), a greater proportion than in the population of London (29%).</p> <p>This concentration in the post-1992 universities is not surprising, as the leading institutions all have metropolitan locations, close to sizable ethnic minority populations who may want to stay close to home, finding it both safer and cheaper.</p> <p>In addition, post-1992 universities offer more vocationally orientated courses, which may be more attractive to ethnic minorities. Hobsons found that black and Asian students are more likely to study sciences, technology or business than arts, humanities or languages. Nursing is the most popular subject among black students, and computer science attracts the largest number of Asian students.</p> <p>The former polytechnic sector also offers more places to mature and part-time students, and takes more students with qualifications other than A-levels, both of which are likely to enhance the numbers from minority groups.</p> <p>Another factor may be that ethnic minority applicants are alienated by both the image and the social context of some pre-1992 universities. That trend is perpetuated as each new generation of entrants is drawn to those universities that already teach significant numbers of students like themselves. So, the pre-1992s may have to address image issues, as well as ensuring they have policies in place to promote social integration, if they are to attract larger numbers of black and Asian students.</p> <p>Even those institutions that have been most successful in recruiting ethnic minority students cannot rest on their laurels, for getting these ambitious applicants through the door is only the first step. We must support them throughout their studies to ensure that we retain them and that they achieve degree results equal to those of their white peers.</p> <p>At the end of their courses, our job is not done until our graduates have a foot on the career ladder. Black and ethnic minority students face special challenges as they enter a labour market that we know discriminates against minority groups. Ethnic minority graduates have significantly lower employment rates than white graduates, although they are more likely to go on to further study.</p> <p>Over 95.5% of white graduates are in work six months after leaving university. But for black African graduates the figure is 83%, for black Caribbeans 87% and for Bangladeshis and Pakistanis 82% and 80% respectively, according to Hesa.</p> <p>Black and Asian graduates start the jobs race with different assets to offer employers. They have less prior experience of paid work, although they are more likely to take up work placements while studying, compared with white students.</p> <p>Another important difference is that black and Asian applicants tend to delay applying for jobs until after graduation, whereas white students are more likely to start their career search in their final year. This means it is especially important that universities provide advice to, and support for, ethnic minority students during their final year, as they make the transition into work. Our careers services are central to this, along with other student support functions. They need to place more of these students in jobs.</p> <p>Black students and graduates can play a useful role supporting each other. Mentoring is at the heart of the developing agenda here. At the University of Greenwich, high-flyers from the City, the civil service and industry team up with students using university mentoring schemes, which provide training and support. Mentors guide students, offering positive role models as well as practical advice on career planning, interview skills and experience of work shadowing.</p> <p>Greenwich students will act as role models to black and Asian secondary school pupils in a new partnership with business in the community. The Merlin project (minority ethnic role models for learning and inspiration) brings together university students and teenagers who would not normally contemplate higher education. These young people will receive the encouragement, skills and the confidence that they will need to succeed in HE. In turn, the university's students get access to the guidance of black and Asian professionals in a new business club.</p> <p>Universities can play an important role in shaping students' perceptions of employers and, in turn, employers' attitudes to ethnic minority students. Many recruiters are actively seeking talent, but are not always aware of the best ways to attract applicants from a wide range of backgrounds.</p> <p>Black students tell us they would like to apply to large organisations with graduate recruitment and training programmes, but unless they can see that the workforce is ethnically representative, they do not feel their applications would be welcome. Generally these perceptions are wrong, and we are working with companies to encourage them to involve black staff in the recruitment process and adopt other good practice.</p> <p>The new business club at the University of Greenwich will provide an informal forum for black and ethnic minority students to meet employers, introducing them to the kind of people they feel they never see and giving them a chance to discover what they need to do to succeed in a business environment. In tackling the problem of young black men finding jobs, we will be forming closer relationships with, and trying to learn from, organisations that work with this group. A good example is 100 Black Men of London, an organisation of professionals working with young people.</p> <p>I do not want to suggest that these sorts of initiatives are sufficient. They are mostly small-scale and, so far, have not been adopted by many institutions. Mentoring projects make a difference, but not enough, yet, to give ethnic minorities equal outcomes in the search for employment. We all need to monitor the progress of ethnic minority students carefully in order to take action to identify and address underachievement and prevent drop-out.</p> <p>Overall, the patterns of achievement that emerge are a cause for some celebration. What they show is the remarkable extent to which many children and young people from British ethnic minorities have overcome language and other barriers to succeed in the sometimes somewhat alien education system they have entered.</p> <p>Some of the students do not achieve the qualifications needed to enter university first time round, but they keep trying, retaking their examinations, and eventually succeed. Their willingness to persevere, often in higher proportions than their white peers, is particularly striking.</p> <p>If this trend continues, it will have an important effect on job opportunities and career prospects for young blacks and Asians in this country, as qualifications become a more and more important route into rewarding employment. Better access to skilled jobs is central in preventing the marginalisation of young people from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>The challenge for universities is to go on widening access by recruiting these students in the first place; then teaching them effectively so that they complete their courses; and finally giving them help in finding work when they graduate. The battle to secure the best possible education for everyone must be fought with renewed vigour. It can be won, as many black and Asian students are proving by their own extraordinary efforts.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tessa Blackstone is vice-chancellor of the University of Greenwich</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow, in York, the Higher Education Academy is being launched for the sixth time - and it's unlikely to get any more headlines than on the last five occasions. Eclipsed in the media by coverage of last week's Tomlinson report on the school curriculum, the academy's existence is not yet a hot topic of discussion in university staffrooms. There, the juicy gossip is more likely to be about who is being poached by which university for the 2008 research assessment exercise (RAE).</p> <p>Now that whole teams of researchers, and not just individual stars, are being wooed in an increasingly cut-throat race for rankings, the academic transfer market is becoming an entertaining spectator sport. So is now the time for an antidote to the research obsession and an initiative to reinstate the importance of teaching in universities? It is, after all, supposed to be their main job.</p> <p>The introduction of undergraduate tuition fees and the prospect of students being charged \u00a33,000 a year has made universities more aware that their teaching, and the \"student experience\" as a whole, is going to be under more rigorous scrutiny. They all at least pay lip service to the idea that teaching needs to move up the agenda. But is the Higher Education Academy the way to do it?</p> <p>There are other national initiatives under way already, in addition to a mass of about 170 different training courses at individual universities - Southampton, for instance, puts all new entrants through a master's course in higher education teaching. Universities are currently bidding to become centres for excellence in teaching and learning; more than 70 bids are into a second round, and over five years 70 more are to be set up by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, at a cost of \u00a3300m.</p> <p>These come on top of the existing 24 subject centres around the UK, which make up the Learning and Teaching Support Network, ranging from bioscience to hospitality and sport, from law to performing arts. These seem to have achieved some success over the past four years in promoting teaching by appealing to what academics really care about - their subjects - rather than more abstract discussion of pedagogy or new technology. An additional \"generic centre\", based at York, attracts far less traffic.</p> <p>This summer, an evaluation of the subject centres concluded that awareness among academics had grown, but added: \"Evidence of direct impact on the student experience was difficult to discern. However, there were reports of reported improvements, improved sensitivities, a wider repertoire and knowledge of student learning, a more serious approach to learning designs etc that we can say is indicative evidence of a better 'learning environment' for students that can be traced directly to the work of the subject centres.\"</p> <p>There is still resistance among lecturers - one told the report's authors that the subject centres were an attempt to impose a national curriculum on universities. And, not surprisingly given current RAE fever, the report comments coyly: \"There are some hints that in mid-2004, teaching is less of a priority for heads of departments and programme leaders than it was in December 2002.\"</p> <p>Paul Ramsden, chief executive of the Higher Education Academy, argues that the new body is necessary to bring coherence to the confusion of different initiatives to improve the student experience. As universities gear up to market themselves to fee-paying students, at home and overseas, he believes the academy can help them with strategies and ideas, such as how to link international research performance with student teaching.</p> <p>He told last week's launch in London: \"We reject the idea of forcing every academic to get a 'licence to practise'. We'll work in partnership with higher education institutions and other agencies. We'll recognise that institutions are different, and have varying missions, diverse student profiles, different staff, and distinctive histories - and avoid a 'one-size-fits-all' approach.\"</p> <p>Ramsden, author of Learning to Teach in Higher Education, was recruited from the University of Sydney, a research-intensive institution that brought in a series of measures to improve its teaching, from peer review of departments to earmarked funds to improve teaching and promotion policies that meant no one became a professor without demonstrating outstanding teaching.</p> <p>His time there convinced him that research does not have to squeeze out teaching. \"The desire to find out and restructure knowledge on the one hand and on the other hand to communicate it to other people go naturally together for most academics. Most do the job because they want to help people learn things.\"</p> <p>But he is agnostic on the fixed belief among many academics that higher education teaching is impossible without doing research as well. Asked about teaching-only universities, Ramsden says his own experience of studying at Rutherford College of Technology (later Newcastle Polytechnic and now Northumbria University), where staff were not doing research, was a good one: he recalls sociologist Bill Williamson as an inspiring teacher.</p> <p>When it comes to raising teaching standards, his primary target is younger academics. \"New entrants to the profession are keen and interested and leaders of the future. They will get more time to research if they can teach more efficiently.\"</p> <p>The Higher Education Academy replaces the Institute of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILT), which claimed 14,000 members, who will now be transferred to the new body. Ramsden is confident that numbers of \"registered practitioners\" will rise as more come through accredited courses at universities and colleges.</p> <p>The leadership of the Association of University Teachers has higher hopes for the new academy after meeting Ramsden, says Paul Cottrell, the union's assistant general secretary, although he adds: \"I don't think it's really filtered down to the ordinary member yet.\"</p> <p>He thinks Ramsden has grasped the fact that academics can be won over but not dragooned. \"The emphasis was much more on the importance of the academy gaining credibility with the profession by demonstrating its usefulness, rather than trying to impose things on the profession.</p> <p>\"I hope it will be done in a more imaginative and efficient manner than the ILT, which wasn't a terribly exciting organisation - it didn't set the profession alight. In the early days it took a very bureaucratic approach, which it did draw back from, but the damage was done and it never really recovered. Ramsden has a much more sophisticated approach and feeling for the nature of academic culture and how to get them on board.\"</p> <p>The union supports the academy's focus on training for new entrants. But Cottrell warns that, despite more recognition for teaching, the RAE still seems to be the driving force in universities and the academy still has a massive task ahead of it. \"They are still going to find it quite hard to gain acceptance and credibility in some areas of the system that have yet to be converted. It's a huge challenge - it's still about changing a culture.\"</p>",
  "<p>The public have turned their backs on the government's Individual Savings Account scheme, with figures yesterday revealing that for the first time more money is pouring out of the plans than going in. </p> <p>The sales flop is acutely embarrassing for the government, coming weeks after the Pension Commission chief, Adair Turner, told ministers that 12 million people are failing to save enough. </p> <p>The Investment Management Association said there was a net outflow of \u00a323.5m from share Isas in September, the first time the figure has been negative since their introduction in April 1999. However figures for cash Isa sales remain positive. </p> <p>Isas were launched by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, as a replacement for Peps and Tessas and initially boomed. Sales of share Isas soared to a rate of more than \u00a32bn a month in early 2000, as small savers ploughed their cash into technology funds at the height of the dotcom era. But nearly everyone who bought a shares Isa in 2000 is still nursing losses, and although the stock market has recovered from its March 2003 low, most technology funds remain 50% or more below their peak. </p> <p>The slide in sales has been exacerbated by a change in the tax status of Isas in April this year. Isas were initially completely free of income and capital gains tax, but in April the Chancellor withdrew a 10% tax credit, making them far less attractive for basic rate taxpayers. </p> <p>The investment industry is now lobbying hard to restore and extend the tax benefits of Isas. Richard Wastcoat, managing director of Fidelity Investments said: \"In an environment where people aren't saving enough for their retirement and the government is urging us to take control of our financial future, it is vital that there is sufficient encouragement from the government in terms of tax relief. </p> <p>\"The decision by the chancellor to reduce the tax relief on Isas has not been helpful in boosting confidence in the savings market and we would urge him to reconsider the move. The forthcoming pre-budget announcement is an ideal opportunity to do just that and to provide the added incentive for more people to start saving again.\" </p> <p>Isas were an important element of Gordon Brown's inaugural budget speech in 1997. At the time he said: \"Half the adult population of our country hardly save at all. So in order to encourage personal savings the government will introduce from 1999, individual savings accounts, extending the principle of Tessas and Peps, continuing to offer favourable tax reliefs for saving. </p> <p>\"Through the new Isa we intend to encourage the habit of saving among people who have never saved before.\" </p> <p>Isa managers say there is now an accelerating trend among savers to cash in their Isas. Simon Ellis, head of retail at Axa Investment Managers, said: \"The Isa in its watered-down form is becoming irrelevant. This is a real pity, since they were working for a broad swath of the population.\"</p>"
