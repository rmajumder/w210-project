  "<p>Had Rio Ferdinand been able to select an environment in which to spend his eight-month suspension, Old Trafford would surely have headed his list. All other considerations aside, Sir Alex Ferguson and his senior players share a unique insight into what it takes to keep a top player motivated as he serves out his sentence. </p> <p>Speaking at Manchester United's ground yesterday, during the preparations for his return to the England team in tomorrow's match against Wales, Ferdinand agreed that the collective experience of watching Eric Cantona take a similar punishment, albeit for a very different type of offence, had given his club a valuable understanding of his position.</p> <p>\"The boss definitely helped with that,\" he said. \"And I spoke to some of the other players - Keaney, the Nevilles and Giggsy - about their experience. They told me a lot. Not necessarily about the things he [Cantona] used to do but about the atmosphere around the training ground. That kind of stuff went a long way.\"</p> <p>Not yet three weeks into his comeback but already with a Champions League group match under his belt and now preparing for a World Cup qualifier, Ferdinand was keen to thank Ferguson and Sven-Goran Eriksson. They share the responsibility for easing him back into action, having helped sustain his morale.</p> <p>\"Alex Ferguson was brilliant with me,\" he said. \"He kept my spirits up and let me get on with training and, if I ever needed to speak to him, I could just knock on the door of his office. He made it clear to me that training would be vitally important to the way I came back.</p> <p>\"He just said, 'Take it in the right frame of mind. You're not injured. You've got eight months to play football. It'll be better than sulking.' I kept saying that to myself and it kept me above water. I kept my focus on football rather than going on holiday and getting away from it. I wanted to keep my mind in tune with the game.\"</p> <p>He was also grateful for Ferguson's support during the Football Association's inquiry into the fateful missed drug test. \"He came to the hearing and for a manager to do that goes a long way. It was the same with Sven. He didn't come to the hearing but he put in a letter supporting me and he spoke out a few times. It will always be remembered and appreciated.\"</p> <p>No doubt his own true feelings run deeper than the brisk analysis he gave yesterday. \"I've never said it was anyone's fault but my own,\" he replied when invited to reflect on the affair. \"From the day it happened I held my hands up and said, 'I'm at fault and I know I'm going to be punished in some shape or form.' Obviously it's arguable whether the way it was dealt with was right or wrong but it's history now. And I don't want to keep going over old ground.\"</p> <p>He will have to put up with it, however, at least until the novelty of having him back wears off. And inevitably the occasional reminders evoke feelings of injustice and wasted time. \"I'm not bitter,\" he said, \"except maybe when I start talking about it sometimes. Usually it's not in my mind. When I'm by myself or with friends and family, it doesn't come up. But some times things are said and there's a bit of needle. Obviously I was there to be criticised and that was always going to happen. It would have been nice if the people who criticised me had known the whole story and known the facts but that wasn't to be. And the fans have been excellent. A lot of the things they've said have gone a long way to keeping me focused.\"</p> <p>But it had not been fun, particularly on match days. \"It was empty. That's the best word to describe it. I went to every home game and most away games and it was nice to be in touch with the team and the game. But every day you're at training it hits home when the others are doing functional stuff and you're not. You're not in that team and you've got a long way to go.\"</p> <p>He watched Euro 2004 in a bar in Miami, enjoying the experience of being a fan. \"I was cheering the team on, getting involved in all the songs and stuff. In a funny way it was nice to be able to watch the tournament like that but in another way it was even harder. You want to be involved, you want to be there.\"</p> <p>Viewing the world from a different perspective had changed him, he said, both as a player and as a man. \"I made sure I used the eight months positively. I looked at my game and I've looked at the way the team plays and I've tried to go through everything with a fine-tooth comb. I don't like to talk about the details but, when you're watching from the stands, you see the bigger picture and you start to understand why people are saying, 'Oh, you should be doing this.' And I've definitely changed as a person. It's made me a lot sharper about certain things and certain issues.\"</p> <p>Returning to action, he said, was like \"a big breath of fresh air\". He came back on September 20, the day after the ban expired, in a defeat of Liverpool at Old Trafford, and 10 days later he walked out wearing the captain's armband for the 6-2 victory over Fenerbahce.</p> <p>\"To feel as comfortable as I have done is quite surprising,\" he said, \"and to walk out at Old Trafford as captain so early in my comeback was fantastic. To captain the club even just one time, to be among that long list, is a great achievement for me.\"</p> <p>It also led Eriksson to drop a hint that Ferdinand might one day lead England, a suggestion the player put firmly in its place yesterday. \"Becks isn't going to be finished for a long time,\" he insisted. \"But the more leaders we have out there on the pitch, the better it is. You've got not just Becks but people like Gary Neville, Steve Gerrard, Sol Campbell, Michael Owen, Frank Lampard, John Terry. These are all influential characters. It's not just down to one person.\"</p> <p>Their reaction to Ferdinand's suspension from internationals was to threaten to withdraw their labour from the vital Euro 2004 qualifying match against Turkey a year ago. Instead they put on a performance notable for their commitment to each other and to their absent team-mate.</p> <p>\"Situations like that normally bring teams together,\" he observed, \"and it did that in our case. You can see it in the training. You can see the ambiance. The atmosphere in the squad is better than it's ever been, in my experience.\"</p> <p>If he could go back and rewrite history, he said, he would. At the age of 25, spending eight months out of the game is no joke. But perhaps no rewriting will be necessary. Out of Ferdinand's misfortune history may yet devise a happy ending.</p>",
  "<p>City traders were taking an unusual interest in the world of freight yesterday following suggestions that logistics group <strong>Exel</strong> could be a takeover target for Swiss competitor K\u00fchne &amp; Nagel. </p> <p>In an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Kla\u00fcs-Michael Kuhne, the boss of K&amp;H, said he was looking for a major European takeover to boost market share and was prepared to see his 56.7% holding diluted - if that became necessary in financing the deal. </p> <p>There is no doubt that Exel, which recently completed the \u00a3330m acquisition of Tibbett &amp; Britten, fits the bill and the recent poor performance of its shares leaves it vulnerable to a bid. However, analysts doubt whether Mr Kuhne could muster the firepower for a tilt at Exel. </p> <p>Exel shares, 760p in June, closed 11p higher at 708.5p, valuing the company at just over \u00a32bn. </p> <p>Logistics was not the only thing on the minds of City traders yesterday. Tobacco also featured after some serious late session buying of <strong>Gallaher</strong>. The group's shares closed 5p lower at 658p but outperformed the rest of the tobacco sector as rumours of a bid approach from either <strong>BAT</strong>, down 16p to 793p, or Japan Tobacco, did the rounds. </p> <p>All of which provided a welcome distraction as leading shares struggled to find direction. The final scores showed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down 7.6 points at 4,698.7, with poor performances from heavyweight drug stocks <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>, 55p cheaper at \u00a321.59, and <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>, off 48p at \u00a311.51, offset by strength in mining and media sectors. </p> <p>Media stocks were in demand after American investment bank Merrill Lynch told clients there was value to be found in the sector, particularly in professional publishing and broadcasting companies. So <strong>Yell Group</strong>, owner of the Yellow Pages, rose 5.75p to 364.5p, while satellite broadcaster<strong>BSkyB</strong> gained 18.25p to 510p and <strong>ITV</strong> added 1.75p to close at 108p. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the <strong>FTSE 250</strong> climbed 13.6 points to 6,384.1, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap index</strong> added 8.6 points to 2,605.1. </p> <p>In the bond market, gilts closed lower, unsettled by a big drop in US unemployment claims. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 101.130, yielding 4,861%. </p> <p>Back among the blue chips, <strong>Sage</strong>, the accountancy soft ware company, rose 5.25p to 117.25p after Goldman Sachs soothed nerves ahead of this month's end of the year trading update. While sales may prove disappointing, Goldman reckons Sage will achieve its earnings forecasts. </p> <p>Speciality chemicals company <strong>ICI</strong>, up 3.75p to 224p, also had a good day after Swiss flavours and fragrances group Givaudan announced third-quarter figures that met market expectations. </p> <p>Retailers <strong>Matalan</strong> and <strong>JJB Sports</strong> provided the main talking points in the FTSE 250. Matalan shares shot up 13p to 239.75p in heavy volume of 25m shares as rumours of a Wal-Mart bid swirled through City dealing rooms. </p> <p>However, market professionals were sceptical, on the grounds that the story seemed to be based on the fact that Wal-Mart, the US owner of Asda, had been in town to give analysts and investors a run-down on plans to expand its George clothing range. </p> <p>Whether that means it will bid for Matalan is anyone's guess, but the fact that Matalan, which is being watched like a hawk by the Takeover Panel, did not feel the need to issue a statement suggests a deal is not under discussion at the moment. </p> <p>The rumours that sent JJB Sports up 14.75p to 251.25p were slightly less flaky. Traders believe the company, which last week received a bid approach from private equity house Cinven, is to seek offers from other venture capitalists. </p> <p>In the small cap arena, <strong>Alizyme</strong>, which hit a 52-week low on Wednesday, rallied 15p to 129p after Merrill Lynch started coverage of the biotechnology company with a buy recommendation and 190p price objective. </p> <p>Like most City punters, Merrill analyst Peter Welford believes Alizyme is a takeover target, given its advanced product pipeline and the chances that its obesity treatment, ATL-962, could become a blockbuster. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the biotech sector <strong>GW Pharmaceuticals</strong>, the Aim-listed group which makes medicines from cannabis, improved 6p to 118.5p after house broker ABN Amro repeated its buy recommendation and 220p price target. </p> <p>\"A meeting with management yesterday reassured us that the real question here is when, not if, lead drug Sativex gets UK approval,\" analyst Adrian Howd said. He believes GW will have to wait until the new year for the regulatory green light for Sativex. </p> <p>Still on Aim, fund management group <strong>Integrated Asset Management</strong> improved 1.5p to 71p after board director Nick Levene declared the purchase of 225,000 shares at 69p. </p> <p><strong>Caledon Resources</strong> shot up 1.12p to 62.5p after being tipped by Tom Winnifrith on investment website T1PS.com. Traders also believe corporate action is imminent at Caledon, and that the company plans to kick-start consolidation of the 20 or so listed mining companies which have an interest in China. </p> <p>Cash shell <strong>RII</strong> climbed 0.5p to 2.5p after entrepreneur Iraj Parvizi appeared on its share register with a 12.8% stake, while rumours of a deal with <strong>BT</strong> helped <strong>Quiktrak Networks</strong> rise 15% to 3p. </p> <p><strong>Winterfloods</strong>, the market-making arm of investment bank Close Brothers, could emerge with a 12% stake in <strong>Ofex Holdings</strong>, London's third tier stock market, which yesterday announced it was in talks to raise \u00a33m via an equity issue at 5p. </p> <p>Sources close to the discussions believe Numis Securities, the company's broker, has found investors willing to back the fundraising. Winterfloods, one of four firms making a market in Ofex stocks, has agreed to inject \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>If Ofex decides to go ahead with the deal it will result in a huge dilution for existing shareholders and the family of founder and outgoing chairman John Jenkins, who own more than 50% of the company. However, it is by no means certain that Ofex, which will run out of cash by the end of November, will agree to go down this route. The company also announced yesterday that it had received a number of tentative takeover approaches, one of which is being taken seriously by the Jenkins family and its advisers. Ofex shares closed unchanged at 7.75p.</p>",

  "A unique \"civic Oscar\" will be handed out in Leeds today to promote active citizenship alongside the city's current economic boom. <p>Business leaders will be reminded of a tradition of large-scale philanthropy by their predecessors during Leeds's last heyday, when lasting monuments such as City Square and the main art gallery were donated by late 19th century locals who had made fortunes and wanted to give something back. </p> <p>Modern Leeds has seen one striking, similar example: the Henry Moore centre which exhibits and researches sculpture through the generosity of the locally-born artist's legacy. </p> <p>Today's ceremony will see the Spirit of Leeds award go to one of three smaller civic players, but speakers will underline their commitment to voluntary work as citizens. A community activist, an innovative architect and the man who cleaned up the once stinking river Aire have been shortlisted for the trophy which will be presented by the journalist and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter. </p> <p>\"All three finalists have tremendous energy and commitment,\" said Kevin Grady, director of Leeds Civic Trust which honed down more than a score of names suggested by local people over the last year. \"Their dedication and enthusiasm has made Leeds a better place to live in for everyone, and continues to do so.\" </p> <p>The three contenders, who will be feted at an Oscar-style ceremony in Leeds's Queen's Hotel, are Freda Matthews, a tireless community activist in the inner-city area of Little Woodhouse; Eric Cowin, whose Eye on the Aire group has expelled sewage and returned otters and game fish to the city centre river; and Ian Tod, architect of the three praised new Leeds buildings: the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, Leeds College of Music and the Yorkshire Dance Centre. </p> <p>Mrs Matthews, 72, led successful bids to win a conservation area partnership for Little Woodhouse and a Millennium Green on the steep Rosebank slope where back-to-back housing was blitzed in the war. Mr Cowin, 64, harassed Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency in a 10-year campaign against sewage, 70% of which came from Bradford. </p> <p>Mr Tod has combined his architectural work with running an annual design forum, 4X4, which brings architects and critics from Britain and overseas to debate in Leeds. The gatherings have been credited with helping stir the city's historic caution over modern building into something approaching enthusiasm.</p>",
  "Bianca Jagger, a leading Latin American environmental scientist and a Russian civil rights organisation are this year's winners of what has become known as the alternative Nobel prize. <p>The Right Livelihood award, worth \u00a3150,000, is presented annually by the Swedish parliament. Founded in 1980, the award is \"to honour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today\". </p> <p>Nicaraguan Ms Jagger, the ex-wife of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger, won her award for what the jury described as \"her long-standing commitment and dedicated campaigning over a wide range of issues of human rights, social justice and environmental protection, including the abolition of the death penalty, the prevention of child abuse, the rights of indigenous peoples to the environment that supports them and the prevention and healing of armed conflicts.\" </p> <p>This year she has been part of the international campaign seeking compensation from ChevronTexaco in connection with their operations in Ecuador. She is also a leading activist on behalf of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Twentieth Century Task Force to Apprehend War Criminals, and has campaigned against the death penalty in the US. </p> <p>Her fellow winner, the Argentinian scientist and environmentalist Ra\u00fal Montenegro, was given his award for his work with indigenous people in Latin America to protect the environment there. The professor of evolutionary biology at the National University of Cordoba was a founder in the 80s of the environmental organisation FUNAM (Environment Defence Foundation). </p> <p>The third recipient is the Russian human rights organisation Memorial, \"for showing, under very difficult conditions, and with great personal courage, that history must be recorded and understood, and human rights respected everywhere.\" </p> <p>The awards will be presented in Sweden in December.</p>",
  "<p>Politicians and IT don't mix. Show an MP a computer and the chances are they will suddenly remember an urgent appointment with the Standing Committee on Tea-Towel Absorbancy. Ministers are even more averse, preferring to stay well off the subject without a posse of civil servants as backup. </p> <p>You can't blame them. Many senior politicians come from a generation that never had to understand computers. Since the dotcom bust, there has been little glory in being associated with e-thingies. And like a masked assassin lurking behind every pillar, there is the ever-present risk of being permanently associated with the next great government IT fiasco. </p> <p>Small wonder, then, that IT scarcely figured in this year's round of political party conferences. Even as an engine for modern and cheaper public services, which was supposed to be on the agenda everywhere. </p> <p>True, Tony Blair was able to make a couple of good news announcements involving IT, but neither involved much risk-taking. Broadband for all by 2008 is a logical outcome of the government's current aggregation strategy and BT's good intentions. Project Semaphore, the first phase in the \"e-Borders\" scheme to track comings and goings into Britain, was no great surprise - most people assumed something along these lines was already happening. </p> <p>So lots of credit to the New Local Government Network for running fringe sessions at all three main party conferences promoting a subject that should interest every elected politician: e-democracy. </p> <p>The Labour conference session (of which I was a slightly redundant chair) disproved my gross generalisations about politicians. It included contributions from a councillor blogger as well as a minister travelling without posse. </p> <p>The blogger was Andrew Brown, cabinet member for the environment at the London borough of Lewisham. One speciality of his blog, <a href=\"http://www.20six.co.uk/Cllr_Andrew_Brown\">www.20six.co.uk</a>, is shaming fly-posts and graffiti, which he snaps with his PDA. The right-on European Social Forum gets the treatment this week. \"The organisers of the European Social forum talk about 'environmental crisis' but don't see any link to the way they behave in their local environment.\" </p> <p>The minister was Phil Hope, undersecretary of state at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. There was no reason to doubt his sincerity when he said that e-government is the most rewarding item in his portfolio. After all, he is also responsible for extricating local authorities from their pensions quagmire, which must make electronic service delivery look like one giant funfair. </p> <p>Up to now, e-government has also involved dishing out funds to innovative local authorities, which is always more fun than taking money away. Hope sounded a warning, however. Opposition MPs are beginning to see government spending on e-services not as a solution to bureaucracy but as an extravagance crying out to be culled. It may be that this aspect of IT, at least, is about to become the subject of a great deal of political interest. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comment to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\"> online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Record companies in the UK are for the first time to sue music fans who download tracks illegally from the internet.</p> <p>The British Phonographic Industry, the trade body for record labels in the UK, is to announce at a press conference today it will take legal action against those who make their record collections available on the web for others to copy. </p> <p>It is following in the footsteps of US labels that sparked a huge row last year after a 12-year-old schoolgirl in New York was sued for downloading songs and ended up paying $2,000 in an out of court settlement.</p> <p>She was one of more than 200 people sued in America.</p> <p>The BPI hopes that by going after so-called \"uploaders\" - those who make digital music files available to others via file-sharing programmes such as Kazaa and Grokster - it will be able to win the PR fight as well as the legal battle. </p> <p>The trade body is expected to argue that it plans to target a hardcore 15% of uploaders who are responsible for 75% of all illegal file-sharing on the internet. </p> <p>But some of those caught up in the legal action are likely to be surprised by the move because anyone signing up to file-sharing programmes automatically makes their own library available to others. </p> <p>The BPI will point to figures showing that seven in 10 people now know that file-sharing is illegal and are aware of the legal alternatives such as Apple's iTunes and Napster and new services offered from the likes of Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Oxfam and Woolworths.</p> <p>Record labels believe it is essential to establish file-sharing as illegal in the minds of the public as portable music players such as the iPod become mass market consumer items. </p> <p>Today's announcement follows a BPI warning in March threatening music pirates in the UK with legal action. </p> <p>Since then it has sent hundreds of thousands of instant internet messages to desktops warning the most frequent users of file-swapping sites that they were being watched. </p> <p>The industry body says its warnings have not deterred the most prolific file-swappers, and today's announcement will send a much stronger message to persistent offenders. </p> <p>UK singles sales have more than halved since 1999, it says, when downloading took off. Sales of CD albums in the UK have bucked the global trend and continue to rise. </p> <p>But record labels are concerned album sales will go the same way as singles, once broadband, which speeds up downloading, is more widely used. </p> <p>The BPI cites research showing that music downloaders spent as much as 32% less on albums and 59% less on singles. </p> <p>But those figures have been questioned by others who argue that file-sharing has no detrimental effect on sales, acting instead as a marketing tool for music fans to discover new bands and genres. </p> <p>They argue the downturn in sales has been caused as much by the industry's over-reliance on disposable pop acts and a lack of innovation as the effect of new technology. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<b> Life before</b> <br> <p>Shopping for clothes means one thing to me: standing outside a changing room in, say, Diesel/LK Bennett/Zara/Jigsaw/M&amp;S/Joseph/Gap - they all blur after a while - waiting for Jane to try something on while I bemoan the lost opportunity to be at home watching Football Focus. I really can't think of many things I'd rather be doing less. I'm of the uniquely male mentality, it seems, that clothes shopping is a mundane, functional fact of life that should be performed with near-military precision and efficiency: ie get in there, get the job done, and extract yourself as fast as possible.</p> <p>I'm not ashamed to say that I'm entirely happy for Jane to dress me. Not literally, of course: I mean when Jane comes home from a shopping trip (from bitter experience, she now usually goes alone or with friends) and hands me a bag of clothes and says, \"Here, I bought these for you.\" It's an arrangement that suits us both.</p> <p><b> The ethical audit</b><br></p> <p>The auditors: <b>Hannah Berry</b>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <b>Mike Childs</b>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <b>Renee Elliott</b>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>Hannah begins by asking us questions about what sort of clothes we wear and where we buy them. My response takes a lot less time than Jane's. \"From what you say,\" says Hannah, \"it suggests that you tend to go for quality rather than label-laden clothes. And you don't suffer from Imelda Marcos tendencies.\"</p> <p>I look to Jane to see how she has taken this woman-to-woman fashion assessment. This could be quite a volatile part of the ethical audit, given her sensitivity to the threat of being told to change the way she dresses. \"This is positive,\" says Hannah (dressed in jeans, T-shirt and velour hooded top), probably sensing the tension, \"because the overconsumption of clothing driven by fashion is taking a huge toll on the environment.\"</p> <p>\"Like most people, you buy your clothes on the high street,\" says Mike (jeans and green cotton shirt). \"While this scores highly on the convenience front, it leaves a lot to be desired from an ethical point of view. Mass-produced fashion is a globalised industry, raising concerns about sweatshop labour, health, safety and environmental standards, as well as the environmental concerns associated with goods being transported around the world. Cheap fashions tend to be disposable in nature, with few garments designed to last more than a season.\"</p> <p>Using the word \"cheap\" in relation to our clothes seems potentially incendiary, so I look to Renee (black trousers and cream silk twinset). \"I don't think you're wearing organic clothes, are you? You look too trendy,\" she says.</p> <p>I smile, but again I'm not sure flattery is going to win Jane over. \"But,\" continues Renee, \"it is worth considering organic cotton, particularly for baby Esme, because cotton is the most highly sprayed textile in the world. It accounts for nearly 25% of the total global insecticide market. If you choose fabrics made from organic cotton, you are getting clothes that not only do not carry pesticide residues but are also not bleached with chlorine dyes, nor coloured with heavy metal dyes.</p> <p>\"You should also try to avoid fabrics that are 'easy care' or 'non-iron'. Many have been treated with formaldehyde - classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of 'unusually high or prolonged exposure'.\"</p> <p>Jane asks about the breadth of organic clothing now on offer. \"Organic clothes are also available in hemp and wool,\" says Renee. \"There are now dozens of companies producing a wide range of organic clothes, including jeans, T-shirts and yoga wear. Some of these are fashionable and well designed.\"</p> <p>Hannah agrees that hunting down clothes made from organic textiles is an important step when sourcing clothes. \"As well as being heavily sprayed with pesticides, cotton - 45% of which is now genetically modified - is also one of the most heavily irrigated crops. In countries with weak or nonexistent pollution controls, where dyeing activities are concentrated, reactive dyes and wastes are regularly flushed straight into watercourses. Also, petrochemical-derived synthetic fabrics are often non-biodegradable.\"</p> <p>I ask about the issue of sweatshops. \"It almost goes without saying that the price of our clothes-buying addiction is paid by those at the bottom of the supply chain,\" responds Hannah. \"But you should note that high-profile workers' rights campaigns, targeted at well-known clothing brands, are not always calls for a consumer boycott. They are often about getting companies to ensure that subcontractors provide fair wages and conditions, and persuading them not to relocate whenever abuses are exposed, thereby leaving workers without jobs.</p> <p>\"The websites <a href=\"http://www.cleanclothes.org\">www.cleanclothes.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sweatshopwatch.org\">www.sweatshopwatch.org</a> both explain the difference between 'worker-called' boycotts, which should be supported, and campaigns which prefer customers to routinely question retailers on, for example, whether they enforce an independently monitored code of conduct, and fix prices to suppliers in function of what is needed for them to pay a living wage.\"</p> <p>Jane makes the point that she has never seen any clothing in the shops that promises to answer these concerns. Mike nods. \"But alternatives for the ethical shopper do exist. However, they tend to involve extra effort or extra cash. Ethical clothing outlets can be found, especially online, with manufacturers such as Ethical Threads. Naturalcollection.com includes more environmentally friendly clothing and, although it is unlikely to satisfy logo junkies, it does the job with some style.\"</p> <p>Another option, says Mike, is to buy second-hand clothes. \"Acquiring the second-hand habit requires practice and a creative approach to style, but can be a cheaper way to stock your wardrobe. Alternatively, if you have time and the skills, you could try making your own clothes. Some claim that knitting is the latest craze - and it can be far more relaxing than a trudge down the high street, or so I'm told.\"</p> <p>And don't forget to give your cast-offs to charity shops such as Oxfam so that they can resell or recycle them, adds Renee.</p> <p>Jane concludes with a question about her favourite subject: shoes. \"Can I buy leather shoes?\" she asks. Hannah doesn't answer directly, but makes a general point about how animals are used to make clothes. \"Around 10% of an animal's value is in its skin, so leather isn't entirely a by-product of the meat industry. Non-leather, non-PVC footwear ordered through, for example, Vegetarian Shoes [<a href=\"http://www.vegetarian- shoes.co.uk\">www.vegetarian- shoes.co.uk</a>, tel 01273 691913] or Green Shoes [<a href=\"http://www.greenshoes.co.uk\">www.greenshoes.co.uk</a>, tel 01803 864997] can often take account of sweatshop concerns as well as animal welfare ones.\"</p> <p><b> Life after</b><br></p> <p>Jane wasn't sold on the idea of ethical clothing. At all. The bottom line, she said after the auditors had left, was that she wouldn't wear anything that she didn't like and feel comfortable in.</p> <p>I was always going to be on thin ice when it came to trying to coax Jane into reassessing her - our - wardrobe, and she was far from impressed by the ethical clothing mail-order catalogues that arrived. But she did agree to go on an ethical shopping trip with me: \"You'll get to go out to the shops like normal and I'll get to act on the auditors' advice,\" I said.</p> <p>My mistake was thinking that London would offer myriad options on the ethical clothes front. But other than the local charity shops, I was left scratching my head. However, after some research online, I found that two ethical retailers had recently opened in central London - American Apparel in Carnaby Street and People Tree in Selfridges on Oxford Street.</p> <p>I also found out there was a Traid shop in Brixton, near where we live - a shop I had always assumed to be a charity shop, but learned was actually a good place to find \"vintage\" clothes and secondhand designer wear.</p> <p>After much hunting around in Selfridges, we found the People Tree concession on the second floor. People Tree, I had learned on their website (<a href=\"http://www.ptree.co.uk\">www.ptree.co.uk</a>, tel 0845-450 4595), uses organic cotton and helps \"marginalised producers to improve their lives by giving design and quality skills, a fair price, regular orders, and advance payment as needed\". But Jane stood in front of the two racks, looked at the merchandise, waved her hand in front of it and said, \"No, to all of that.\" To be fair to her, it was a little too, in her words, \"80s retro\".</p> <p>We then went to Carnaby Street in search of American Apparel (<a href=\"http://www.americanapparel.co.uk\">www.americanapparel.co.uk</a>, tel 020-7734 4477), whose clothes are produced \"sweatshop-free\" in a factory in Los Angeles where employees are paid $12.50 an hour, more than double the minimum wage. As this was an entire shop over two floors, there was much more to choose from - even if we did feel a little out of place among the skater kids who seemed to be its target demographic. We bought some T-shirts and tops and even some things for Esme.</p> <p>The trip to Traid (eight shops in London and Brighton, <a href=\"http://www.traid.org.uk\">www.traid.org.uk</a>, tel 020-8733 2580) was successful, too. For me at least. Jane just couldn't get over her phobia of wearing second-hand clothes, but I managed to find a pair of jeans (\u00a315) and a John Rocha jacket (\u00a330).</p> <p>The one thing missing from my \"new head-to-toe ethical look\", as Jane mocked, was a pair of shoes. Hannah had told me that Adbusters (<a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org\">www.adbusters.org</a>), the Canadian anti-corporate magazine, sold a pair of trainers that were \"sweatshop-free\", but then I heard that a similar concept trainer, made by US-based No Sweat Apparel (<a href=\"http://www.nosweatapparel.com\">www.nosweatapparel.com</a>), was available in the UK through Fair Deal Trading (<a href=\"http://www.fairdealtrading.com\">www.fairdealtrading.com</a>, tel 0870 766 5196). They looked a little like a pair of Converse All Star sneakers I had as a child, and for \u00a325 seemed like good value, too.</p> <p>For more about Leo's experiment, and the chance to post your own views and tips, visit <a href=\"http://www.money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving\">money.theguardian.com/ethicalliving</a> Leo's next report, on volunteering, will appear in two weeks.</p>",

  "<p>I'm really beginning to worry about mobile games. I've played a heck of a lot of new ones over the past week or so, and I've noticed that very few developers seem willing to address the INTRINSIC LIMITATIONS of the mobile handset as a gaming device. Here is where I think things are going wrong\u2026</p> <p>For a start, many phones don't have joystick/direction pads, and those that do usually only offer four-way movement, so travelling diagonally is a no-no. Lots of games like Judge Dredd, Werewolf and FIFA 2005, do try to get around this problem by putting diagonal movement on the keypad, but this is a bit of a fudge in my opinion. I don't think I have fat fingers but when two or more digits hit the pad of my Nokia 6600 (not even a particularly small phone) genuine intuitive control over the game just falls apart. Should we perhaps be holding off on these games until phones with eight-way d-pads are commonplace? Or maybe not bother at all.</p> <p>Also, very few mobile handsets allow you to press more than one button at a time. This means that attempting everyday multi-tasking activities such as running and shooting, running and jumping, or in fact running and doing anything else whatsoever, are out of the question. When beset by enemies, it's unjust to expect a player to stop, shoot, and then continue running \u2013 and yet so many games require you to do just that.</p> <p>And don't even get me started on the limitations of J2ME, the mobile derivative of the Java programming language. If you've ever played a Java game you'll know what they are: 'music' that consists of little more than a few bleeps strung together into what can only be optimistically referred to as a tune, and animation that is often so sluggish you can make a cup of tea in the time it takes a bullet to reach it's intended target \u2013 on the other a screen that measure barely an inch and a half. Sun Microsystems is addressing the problem and many handsets now support a perkier new version of Java with lots more game-specific features, but I've yet to see many titles that exploit the benefits.</p> <p>Of course, this is the reason why so many people are still playing Space Invaders, Pac Man and Tetris on their phones. These games were designed with a simple interface in mind. They lose nothing in the translation to a limited mobile format. Okay, it's great that mobile phones are now on the multi-format checklist for many new releases, but publishers really need to think about how their franchises are realised on this emerging format. If this market is going to develop, mobile gamers needed to be treated with a little respect. There needs to be an understanding of the hardware.</p> <p>Ubisoft's relationship with mobile developer <a href=\"http://www.gameloft.com\">Gameloft</a> is a brilliant example of how it should be done. The mobile translation of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a 2D platformer \u2013 Gameloft hasn't tried to mimic the 3D visuals of the title's console counterparts. And yet the essence of the gameplay \u2013 sneaking about in the shadows, working out how to takedown enemies with as little fuss or noise as possible, solving mini-puzzles strewn throughout the locations \u2013 are all present. The pace is perfect too. When you arrive on a new screen, you're very rarely in immediate danger. You get time to analyse the movement patterns of enemies and figure out how you can get to them without being seen. Speed and lightning responses are not integral elements of the game dynamic so the sluggishness of the animation is never really an issue.</p> <p>And of course there are plenty of new, original mobile games that understand and work within the limits of the technology. Just about everything that <a href=\"http://www.morpheme.co.uk/\">Morpheme</a> creates is worth playing, because the company makes simple, funny, bright games with lots of decent ideas \u2013 the sort of games that built the home computer entertainment industry of the early eighties. Check out Balloon-Headed Boy or Phantom Mansion and you'll see what I mean. In today's Online section of the Guardian I rave about <a href=\"http://www.sumea.com/\">Sumea</a>'s Jumbo Rumble, a laughably dumb multiplayer elephant battle game which allows three players to take part simultaneously on one handset. Brilliant.</p> <p>By getting ahead of itself and constantly outpacing the hardware, the mobile games industry is in real danger of completely alienating its audience forever. I mean, it's hard enough to actually download games without making them impossible to play, too. Vodafone Live! And the O2 Games Arcade are very good, but often mobile users aren't sure how much they're paying for the game, or where it'll download to on their handset, or if the title in question is actually compatible with their phone anyway. At least the major network operators are trying to make things as simple as possible - and with 3G set to launch over the next few months they really need to. They know (or at least <em>hope</em>) there's going to be big money in multimedia downloads \u2013 games, video, music \u2013 when this faster, slicker service is fully operational. They know they have to get things right.</p> <p>But somehow things aren't quite right. Not yet. The mobile handset is getting pulled in all sorts of directions that it doesn't want to go in. 3D gaming? It'll arrive next year, and companies like ATI and nVidia are working on specialist 3D chipsets for the latest handsets. But I know that when these phones arrive, developers will immediately become too ambitious, attempting to jam in all the latest special effects, rather than sitting down and thinking, \"okay, how can we use 3D visuals to really offer something new in terms of mobile gameplay? And should we perhaps start with flat-shaded polys before barging in with alpha blending, environment-mapping and multi-layered textures?\"</p> <p>I want to see more games that use the unique capabilities of mobiles, rather than games that try and ignore the limitations. Last year UK developer <a href=\"http://www.macrospace.com\">Macrospace</a> launched Cannons ME an over-the-air two-player combat game allowing users from around the country to engage in tank warfare. This year, it is launching several more two-player games inviting you to hook up with strangers and play across the phone networks. French company <a href=\"http://in-fusio-games.com/\">Infusio</a> is doing a similar thing via its ExEn platform. There have also been several Bluetooth compatible games (Bluetooth Biplanes, Pat Cash Tennis, Fatal Force) that let players in close proximity engage in two-player bouts. These really focus in on the intrinsic social connotations of the mobile phone.</p> <p>I also like camera phone games like <a href=\"http://www.elkware.com/\">Elkware</a>'s Photo Pet where you have to feed your onscreen creature by taking photographs of specific colours. It's an idea that originated in Japan where clever game concepts that could only be realised on mobile phones are common. You may well have heard of the mobile fishing game that uses location-based technology to discover where the user is and then changes the in-game weather and time of day to match the real world environment. Then there is the burgeoning world of the location-based game which allows participants to turn cities into game levels. <a href=\"http://www.botfighters.com/\">Botfighters</a> for example.</p> <p>But of course for western mobile developers \u2013 who do not have an audience so receptive to quirky ideas - it's easier and less of a gamble to hook up with a nice console conversion job - to try and squeeze a PS2 title onto as large a range of handsets as possible. It's classic short-term thinking and it is leading to a stunted industry. Let's face it, trying to accurately replicate console titles can, by definition, only ever lead to a diminished gameplay experience. Look at Game Boy Advance \u2013 some of its poorest titles are conversions of PS2, Xbox and Game Cube bestsellers. Its best are titles like WarioWare \u2013 designed specifically with GBA in mind.</p> <p>Most gamers find it hard to take mobile games seriously. I find it hard to blame them a lot of the time. But then when I'm playing crazy stuff like Balloon-Headed Boy I realise that mobile developers don't <em>need</em> to seduce gamers. They have a mass entertainment device on their hands \u2013 there could be two billion mobile phone users in the world by 2006. What is needed are ideas that will capture the imagination of the typical non-gaming phone owner. Those ideas won't come from slavishly converting inappropriate games to a platform that isn't designed to handle them. These ideas will come when designers start to think about the unique properties of the mobile format. And when someone does hit upon a truly mass entertainment mobile phone experience, you can forget about the impact made by Space Invaders, or Tetris, or Doom, or Pokemon or The Sims. They'll be blasted away. I believe that - even now while I'm struggling to achieve diagonal movement on a simple footie sim. I believe it, but I'm still worried.</p>",

  "<p>New maps of flood risks across the country which could cause a 15% drop in house values in vulnerable areas and large increases in insurance premiums, will be available for the first time today. </p> <p>House owners will be able to find out whether their homes are at low, moderate, or high risk of flooding by pinpointing them on an internet map on the Environment Agency site. </p> <p>For many the maps will be good news because new, more sophisticated techniques mean the information is no longer based just on postcodes. As a result 100,000 homes have been moved out of the at-risk zone - although there are still 1.8m homes in the one-in-100-year risk of a flood area. </p> <p>It is those in the higher risk area, a one-in-75-year chance, who will find themselves having to negotiate for flood insurance and may face a drop in value of their house. </p> <p>Peter Bolton King, the chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, found he was one of the lucky ones, his house having been moved out of a flood-prone area on the new maps. \"It is a relief to me because I know that those who cannot get flood insurance cannot get a mortgage. </p> <p>\"What we have found is that the price of a house drops if it has been prone to flooding in the past, particularly the recent past ... Strangely, if the maps say there is a risk but there has not been a flood then it is ignored.\" </p> <p>David Proverbs of the Flood Research Group at Wolverhampton University, said work in Shrewsbury this year showed that recent flooding lowered prices for individual properties by around 15%. </p> <p>Work for a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors report showed there was a growing awareness among house buyers of the issues of global warming and flood dangers. Mortgage lenders would certainly make them aware of the risks. </p> <p>\"On the other hand in Bewdley in Worcestershire people pay a premium to live next to the river Severn even if they know it is probable that their properties might be flooded once a year. They cannot get insurance but they have adapted, they have tiled floors without carpets downstairs and all the electrics are above flood level on the walls. That might be the way that houseowners have to go.\" </p> <p>The insurance industry welcomed the new flood maps as a helpful way of assessing risks. In practice, few people were left without insurance altogether but they may have to pay higher prices and face a large excess on their property. Those out of flood risk areas would be paying very little for flood insurance and those in the worst areas would have to enter into individual negotiation with their companies. </p> <p>The chairman of the Environment Agency, Sir John Harman said: \"Flooding is a natural phenomenon that will become more frequent as climate change leads to more extreme weather conditions. Find out whether or not you and your property, your family and friends are at risk from flooding and decide what action you need to take - don't leave it too late.\" </p> <p>The Environment Agency site advises people on measures they can take to protect their homes. Ideas include devices to prevent flood water entering doors. Home owners can also apply to be put on the flood early warning system. </p> <p>The new maps include areas prone to flooding but protected by flood defences, including large areas of London. </p> <p>There is also a new category - a one-in-1,000-year risk. This is mainly aimed at preventing local authorities granting planning permission for new housing estates in flood-prone areas where, because of climate change, the risks can only get worse. </p> <p>Among these areas is the proposed Thames Gateway development on the Thames estuary. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">FInd out if you are at risk of flooding - Environment Agency</a></p>",
  "<p> There's a lot of information out there on the internet's many websites, but we're all now becoming adept at using search engines to find it. However, there's one important place where effective search is still hard to find: on your own PC. </p> <p>Effective desktop search has been around the corner for decades. In the 1980s, for example, there were things such as Lotus Magellan and On Location; in the 1990s, Enfish; and this year, X1. Unfortunately, it seems to be a long corner, and sometimes it seems to be getting even longer. </p> <p>The Longhorn release of Microsoft Windows, for example, promised much, with built-in tools to catalogue documents, add meta-data and sort files based on content, not just file names. However, Microsoft recently announced it was not going to include the much-heralded WinFS file system technologies in Longhorn: it is now being integrated into server software, and is expected to arrive along with the promised Longhorn version of Windows Server. But three or more years is a long time to wait for the tools people need today. </p> <p>Luckily, some new desktop search tools are appearing, and could change the way we work with PCs. </p> <p>Outlook users have long complained about its slow and complex search tools, which rarely found the item as soon as you wanted it. The arrival this summer of the free Lookout plug-in changed that. Based on open-source tools from the Apache Foundation, Lookout was Outlook search on steroids. By keeping a local index of all your mailbox data, Lookout could pull up relevant responses in seconds. Its search engine could have been more refined, but that did not matter: Lookout's brute force approach came up with the goods. It also went beyond Outlook mailboxes, and indexed files held in Windows' My Documents folder. </p> <p>Lookout was so good that Microsoft's MSN division bought the company and, it is believed, will be working on a new search bar for Internet Explorer. Lookout has now become an official Microsoft download, ready to help you keep control of Outlook information overload. </p> <p>But Lookout is not the only tool that can search for the files you need. Copernic, a British company, is well known for its meta-search tool, which sits on your desktop and integrates search results from many of the most popular (and most reliable) search engines. Copernic Search has recently been joined by Copernic Desktop Search. Unlike Lookout, Copernic's offering is a standalone application, and it indexes files, music, pictures and videos along with email and contact information. </p> <p>Copernic's image search tools do not support the metadata information used by most digital cameras. Instead, you are limited to a date search - so you are probably better off using a tool such as Picasa, Google's recent purchase. Like iPhoto on the Apple Macintosh, Picasa is a tool for cataloguing images, though it also has rudimentary editing features. Unlike most image applications, Picasa continuously monitors your PC, automatically adding new photographs to its catalogue. </p> <p>Picasa is Google's first venture on to the desktop (unless you count the Google Toolbar), but it is unlikely to be the last. A Google desktop search tool, codenamed Puffin, is under development, but has been kept under wraps. Leaks have pointed to work being done using the Gecko rendering engine from the Mozilla open source browser project. Since the GBrowser domain name has been registered by Google, there is some speculation that this may be Puffin's final incarnation. </p> <p>Google is not the only company working along these lines. In March, Terra Lycos's HotBot search engine launched a toolbar that offers local-content search features, and in June, Ask Jeeves bought Tukaroo Inc, a San Jose-based desktop search technology company. However, Google is one of the few companies with the power to get its system widely adopted. </p> <p>The key to successful desktop search is the idea of context. Users do not need to be bombarded by information; instead they only want what is relevant to the task in hand. This is where Lookout succeeds, as it focuses mainly on email. However, you may want to see information related to the Word document you are editing, or the browser window you have opened. </p> <p>Drive into San Francisco on Highway 101 and you'll see billboards advertising Blinkx, a tool that mixes contextual information with desktop and web search, and uses technology from another British company, Autonomy. When Blinkx is running, you see a new toolbar in your application's title bar. This contains a set of icons that show whether Blinkx has found any documents on your PC, or on the web, related to the content of your window. Just roll the mouse over the icon to see a sample of the information Blinkx has found. It is an interesting idea, and when linked to the visualiser tools in Blinkx's web search engine, helps make more sense of how information is related to your query. </p> <p>One key to solving the desktop search problem is the use of metadata in our applications. When combined with standard XML document formats, this will give PCs their own little semantic web. This will put search at the heart of our operating systems - and the sooner, the better. </p> <p>Apple is including Spotlight desktop search tools in Tiger, the next release of its Mac OS X operating system. Apple says Spotlight is going to \"search all your stuff\", and deliver the information you need quickly, using lessons learnt from iTunes, Sherlock, and iPhoto. Like WinFS, Spotlight will use file metadata to index files quickly, with a deeper content index for more complex searches. As it is an operating system feature, developers will be able to build Spotlight searches into their applications - which Windows programmers won't be able to do until WinFS appears. </p> <p>The Linux desktop is also well on its way to a context-based search environment with Nat Friedman's Dashboard (which predates Apple's use of Dashboard for an unrelated application). This Dashboard is intended to index files, and then display relevant content based on what you are doing. The complexity is in building interfaces to application back-ends, and in building the tools for defining exactly what is relevant. There is no point in deluging users with information - it has the same effect as not giving enough information, or delivering irrelevant information. Users need to trust their search tools to deliver the results they need: no more and no less. </p> <p>The main limitations on desktop search tools are the use of disk space and processor cycles, which has discouraged the widespread use of Microsoft's indexing software. Search tools need to build indexes of the content on your system, and this can be anything up to 30% of the size of the original collection of files.

  "<p>Manchester will become the first city in the UK to host a global swimming event after it was chosen to host the World Short-Course Championships in 2008. </p> <p>Two temporary prefabricated pools will be constructed at the MEN Arena to accommodate the competition as Fina, the world aquatics governing body, stipulate a minimum spectator capacity of 8,000 to 10,000.

  "<p>Tate Modern's exhibition Time Zones is long overdue, the first survey of time in recent film and video that the Tate has ever mounted. One could quibble and say that the subject applies to almost anything, and complain too that not all the work is terribly recent, or entirely unfamiliar, though only one work has, to my knowledge, been shown before in London. It is thoughtfully presented, however - a juxtaposition of very different styles and sensibilities. </p> <p>With engagingly rough-textured directness, Turkish artist Fikret Atay encouraged a pair of bored teenagers in his hometown of Batman, Turkey, to improvise a Kurdish song and dance in the town's grubby ATM booth. There's a subtext: Kurdish music was banned for a long time in Turkey, and the presence of the cash machine is at odds with the down-at-heel, probably cardless kids, for whom the booth is as much as anything a place to get out of the wind. </p> <p>How different in style this is to the exquisite mannerism of Shanghai-based Yang Fudong's Liu Lan. In this pale, watery black and white film, a young man in a white suit meets - or perhaps fantasises about meeting - a traditionally dressed country girl who lives beside a reed-fringed lake. The dreamy nostalgia of the film is heightened by the sadness and sentimentality of the music, the stylised acting, and the woodblock-cut credits at the end, as though the film comes from another time. </p> <p>Time in Yang's work feels elastic, cyclical rather than linear - just as it is in Serbian artist Bojan Sarcevic's circular walk through Bangkok. It's a purposeful yet absurdly pointless stride that brooks no interference, and engages no interest from the slower-paced street-sellers and hawkers of the city. I expect him to come a cropper like Monsieur Hulot. He doesn't. </p> <p>Unlike Sarcevic, we can drift through the day along with the 12-hour continuous take of the Zocalo, the vast square in the centre of Mexico City, by Francis Al\u00ffs, and zone out in the slow ecclesiastical time of Wolfgang Staehle's live-feed webcam shot of the 11th-century monastery at Comburg in Germany. The monastery, viewed on its distant hill, was yesterday afternoon a German picture postcard in the slanting autumn sun. By evening it was pretty dark, as one would expect. Stay long enough and the place will be obliterated by rain, wrapped in fog and capped by winter snow. The seasons will turn, the nights lengthen towards the winter solstice ... you get the picture. </p> <p>We could do with a few sofas, rather than the dodgy ergonomics of Tate Modern's benches. When Al\u00ffs's Zocalo, May 20, 1999 was last seen in London in a Lisson Gallery show, you could stretch out as the shadow of the enormous flagpole in the centre of the Zocalo made its 12-hour, sun-dial sweep of the square. People line up to stand in the shadow, huddling together at the flagpole's base at midday. </p> <p>Constant vigilance and rapt attention aren't what works like Al\u00ffs's or Staehle's are really asking for. They are opportunities for a different kind of immersion, another register of perception. It is not so much a case of watching them closely as of their slowly unrolling or endlessly looped presentness. </p> <p>I could also keep watching Fiona Tan's camera all day, as it inquires, insinuates, probes and glides over the make-up and kimonos, the faces and jewellery and hairdos of the Toyisha archery festival in Japan, where young girls perform a highly stylised archery contest as a rite of passage into adulthood. Saint Sebastian appears an almost entirely celebratory work, apart from the title, and filled with visual texture and pleasure and tiny human incident. Nowadays, this is a rare thing, and I have to say I loved it in a way I doubt Tan intended. </p> <p>Jeroen de Rijke and Willem de Rooij's 10-minute view of a Jakarta cemetery, one of two films the pair have made in the city, also has an intent more subtle than it appears. Their work is characterised by space and atmosphere as much as it is preoccupied by the passing of time. Strollers and mourners drift between the graves. The towers of the city crowd the horizon, like different kinds of tombs. It is as though we were hovering slightly above it all, with a highly focused, elevated view. Like God, perhaps. The work of these two artists from the Netherlands is painterly and rich; I kept thinking of Courbet. There is always some indefinable pathos in their calculated witnessing of the passing world. </p> <p>We are also witnesses to the tedious and inane machismo of Israeli car-hounds in their all-terrain gas-guzzlers, as they rev and shunt and stall their cars around the impossible gradients of the tyre-wrecked sand dunes outside Tel Aviv, in Yael Bartana's Kings of the Hill. I guess this is meant as metaphor for the Israeli male mindset, and of a state ranting and miring itself in sand. It works well enough, but I feel the work isn't altogether apposite here. </p> <p>With rather more ingenuity, Anri Sala's 2002 double projection, Blindfold, shows a pair of new, naked billboards in Albania. Their blank, canted metal surfaces catch and reflect the low sunlight, which blasts the static camera like a blinding death ray, bleaching out the sky and surrounding buildings in blisters of light. As the sun moves, the buildings and passersby emerge from a strangely day-for-night, light-shocked gloom. This film almost takes us back to the strategies of 1970s structuralist film-making, yet its matter-of-fact materialism is another metaphor for the fitful emergence of global capitalism in Albania. This isn't Sala's best work, by any means, and though I like the work in Time Zones a lot, I keep thinking this isn't quite the video and film show we need right now. What is needed is more depth, with more than one or two works by each artist. More time, in other words, more space, more sofas. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Time Zones: Recent Film and Video is at Tate Modern, London SE1, until January 2. Details: 020-7887 8008.</p>",
  "<p>St Andrews University today launched an online guide to poetry through the ages to coincide with national poetry day.</p> <p>The website documents the historical progression of poetry in seven global regions, with links to information about the major poet of each era. </p> <p>It has sections documenting the poetry of Africa and south east Asia, and period-by-period analysis of the development of poetry in the UK. </p> <p>Robert Crawford, poet and head of the university's school of English, thought up the idea.</p> <p>He said: \"This isn't the only site on the web devoted to poetry, but it aims to be uniquely authoritative and reliable in the information it provides, because it is drawing on the collective acumen of experts in the field. Its historical and geographical scope is more comprehensive than the material available elsewhere on the web.\"</p> <p>In 2002, the university, which supports contemporary poets to the tune of more than \u00a3150,000 a year, designated one of its seafront buildings to poetry. The Poetry House, thought to be the largest building in Britain, excluding libraries, devoted to writing and reading poetry, plays host to research, teaching and poetry readings and workshops throughout the academic year. </p> <p>\"St Andrews is rapidly becoming known as a poetry town,\" said Professor Crawford. </p> <p>The Poetry House works in partnership with the StAnza festival, Scotland's largest poetry festival, and with the Public Library to offer a programme of poetry-related activities that spans the calendar. </p> <p>\"Our world-class website makes our expertise, our latest reviews, and up-to-the-minute events available to a global audience: it's the icing on the cake,\" added the professor.</p> <p>The launch of the site was marked with a cake-cutting ceremony to coincide with the theme of this year's national poetry day - food.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Calisto Tanzi</strong> Founder of Parmalat. Mr Tanzi, 65, transformed a family business - Calisto Tanzi &amp; Sons - selling prosciutto in the northern Italian town of Parma into one of Italy's biggest companies. Even when Parmalat became a global dairy empire, the 65-year-old ran the company like a family concern. It was Mr Tanzi who saw the potential of long-life milk stored in cartons as the basis for global expansion. Mr Tanzi also seized the marketing opportunities provided by sporting activities such as football, skiing and motor racing to make Parmalat a top brand in Italy. <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,12576,1114366,00.html\">The milk sheikh whose dream curdled</a> </p> <p><strong>Fausto Tonna</strong> Parmalat's former finance director. His first public utterance after his arrest was to wish journalists and their families a \"slow and painful death\". Described by one American banker who met him as having the \"manners of a peasant\" but a \"sharp mind for figures\", Mr Tonna served as finance director for 16 years until he resigned in February 2003. The 52-year-old, considered the financial brains behind Parmalat, worked his way up from a clerk's job after joining the company in the early 1970s. <strong>Stefano Tanzi</strong> The son of Calisto Tanzi and a former chief executive of Parmalat.

  "<p>The British music industry said today it would not balk from following its US counterpart in suing children as young as 12 for swapping tracks over the internet without paying for them.</p> <p>The British Phonographic Industry, which represents more than 90% of UK record labels, said 28 cases against the worst offenders were already pending and it promised hundreds more would follow.</p> <p>Asked if it would stop short of pursuing children - even if it resulted in a public relations disaster - the BPI said: \"It is not our intention to target children but [we will] if they are breaking the law on a very large scale.\"</p> <p>The use of illegal file-sharing networks has fallen in the US and sales have increased since the Recording Industry Association of America instigated more than 200 legal actions last March. However, the body prompted a PR backlash when it emerged that one of the cases involved a 12-year-old girl in New York, who paid $2,000 in an out of court settlement. </p> <p>The BPI's first spate of legal action will target those using file-sharing programmes such as Kazaa, iMesh, Grokster, Bearshare and WinMX. The body said it would target \"major uploaders\" - the 15% of users who make available three-quarters of the free tracks. </p> <p>It will identify users by their IP address, the code that distinguishes one internet connection from another.</p> <p>The BPI is stepping up its campaign against illegal file-sharing because its promotional campaigns and threats have failed to stop the activity.</p> <p>Peter Jamieson, the BPI chairman, today said lawsuits would become as common as action against shoplifters from record stores and market traders who sell pirate CDs. </p> <p>According to the BPI, about 6 million people are connected to peer-to-peer services, sharing 700 million illegal tracks.</p> <p>The services have proved hard to shut down because they do not store tracks in a physical location but allow individual users to share their CD collections with the world. </p> <p>\"We have been warning people for months that unauthorised file-sharing is illegal. These are not people casually downloading the odd track. They are uploading music on a massive scale, effectively stealing the livelihoods of thousands of artists and the people who invest in them,\" said Mr Jamieson. </p> <p><strong>BPI warns file-sharers: 'We are watching you'</strong><br></p> <p>Today's announcement follows a BPI warning in March threatening music pirates in the UK with legal action. Since then it has sent hundreds of thousands of instant internet messages to computer desktops, warning the most frequent users of file-swapping sites that they were being monitored. </p> <p>The BPI said the 28 file-sharers it was targeting were responsible for making up to 7,000 tracks available at any one time. </p> <p>It expects most cases to be settled before going to court - offenders will be forced to pay thousands of pounds in damages and will be subject to injunctions stopping them swapping tracks over the web. </p> <p>Jay Berman, the chairman of international trade body the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, said ignorance of the law was no defence. He pointed to research that revealed seven out of 10 people were now aware file sharing was illegal. </p> <p>\"A year ago, maybe, people could say they didn't know - but you'd be hard pressed to say the same today,\" he said. </p> <p>The industry's case has been strengthened by the emergence of dozens of legal internet download sites such as Apple's iTunes and Napster. There are at least 100 legitimate sites across Europe, offering more than 1 million tracks for about 79p each. </p> <p><strong>Piracy is theft, says minister Estelle Morris</strong><br></p> <p>Today's action by the BPI is part of a wider spate of legal proceedings co-ordinated by the IFPI around the world. </p> <p>The federation today said it was launching 459 actions, including some in the UK and France, taking the global total to more than 600. </p> <p>Music sales have been decimated across Europe in recent years. As a result of actions brought in March, up to 80 people have already paid fines of up to 13,000 euros. </p> <p>UK album sales have bucked the global trend but sales of singles have declined by half. The BPI said it feared the increasing popularity of broadband internet connections would hit album sales unless drastic action was taken.</p> <p>The government also backed today's initiative. The arts minister, Estelle Morris, said: \"Piracy is theft - pure and simple. Whether it's Jamelia or a jobbing musician, the artist suffers. We owe it to them to make sure they get a fair return for their creativity, flair and inspiration. </p> <p>\"The government supports the principle of proportionate legal action against the worst offending uploaders. I hope it will stop the habitual offender who uploads to make a quick buck out of other people's talent.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Reuters, the financial news service, will today officially unveil an office in south India that will see 20 journalists cover 2,000 small to medium-sized American companies listed on the New York stock exchange. </p> <p>The operation, based in Bangalore, has been running for six months with a six-strong editorial team reporting on companies' earnings, press releases and filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as well as analysts' stock alerts. </p> <p>This is just the beginning for Reuters in Bangalore. The company's data unit, which archives material for 30,000 global firms, already employs 300 people and will grow by another 300 next year. The average age in the office is 25. </p> <p>In outsourcing journalism and data processing, Reuters has become the first large media company to base US corporate reporting functions offshore. </p> <p>The job of financial news reporter is just the latest in a long line of positions, ranging from call centre operator to legal researcher, which have been sent abroad in recent years. Part of the reason is improved global communications; the other is that work can be done more cheaply in poorer countries. </p> <p>Reuters admits costs are 60% less in Bangalore than its \"onshore\" centres in New York, Britain and Singapore. But sensitive to the charge that it is cutting back in the west only to hire abroad, managers deny that this is a reason for coming to India. </p> <p>\"Bangalore has two main advantages. People here speak English and we have a large, highly educated workforce, in terms of the number of MBAs and finance degrees,\" says Marion Leslie, head of data operations, who moved from the company's Devon office to Bangalore earlier this year. </p> <p>\"It is number-heavy work and you need people who can understand financial markets and make them understandable.\" </p> <p>The technology boom has connected Bangalore to the rest of the world far more rapidly than in other developing countries. The result, say journalists there, is that it is now possible to send information around the world as easily as across a room. </p> <p>In the far end of the Reuters office, situated on the fourth floor of a glass and concrete tower in downtown Bangalore, Matthew Veedon motions to a colleague about a story that needs writing and a deadline is looming. \"Prudential have put out an upgrade on the stock, and it's important that we get the story first,\" says Mr Veedon, news editor in the Bangalore bureau. Like most journalists, the 32-year-old wants to beat his competitors in the news business. \"We have American 24-hour news in our office and there's a buzz filing a report and then to see the copy making headlines on the television,\" he says. </p> <p>In two shifts, starting at 3.30pm and ending at 4am the next day, Mr Veedon's six-person team is part of an effort by the company to expand coverage of small and mid-cap companies listed in New York. </p> <p>\"We can have a big effect. A couple of weeks ago we ran a story on a $60m (\u00a333.7m) merger between two tech companies based in Texas. Before we came along nobody would notice. But our story pointed out the offer price of the deal was 50% higher than the trading price. The result was the stock shot up.\" </p> <p>Mr Veedon says that Bangalore is not yet big enough to handle breaking news. \"Once the story requires interviewing a company director, or analysts then the New York bureau takes over. We are just starting up here.\" </p> <p>Though Reuters, which has its headquarters in London, is perhaps best known as an international news agency, the bulk of its revenue comes from the 400,000 people in the City, on Wall Street and in other financial centres who use its information products. </p> <p>These rely on first extracting information and then manipulating it to create the graphs and tables that are building blocks of the expensive packages on the desks of corporate financiers. </p> <p>Tracking the boardroom shuffles and share offers of thousands of companies across the world is a labour-intensive affair. For Reuters, young workers in south India appear willing and able to process large amounts of raw data. </p> <p>Take company appointments. In the Bangalore office, a team of seven graduates work through the boardrooms of more than 200 companies a day checking names, ages, departures and the salaries of top management. </p> <p>\"It's crucial we get this right. During the peak reporting season we each handle 40 companies a day. After all we have customers paying for the information and they need to know it's up to date and accurate,\" said Anupam Singhi, team leader in the fundamentals section. </p> <p>With low costs and numerate employees, Reuters has been able to bring a factory-style approach to what appears to be white-collar work. Preetie Bindra, 22, and her colleagues spend every day checking the earnings estimates of 6,000 multinationals in Asia, America and Europe, including 1,200 in Britain. </p> <p>\"You soon get used to the format used by different analysts to present information. The idea is to standardise the format so that anyone of us can take the information and present the results in the same way.\" </p> <p>Bangalore is already producing results, with its new package, Reuters Knowledge, being sold to investment managers. The package allows a single company's news to be tracked with each headline graded on whether it will move the stock price. For Kath Loosemore, who worked on Knowledge, it is proof that Bangalore \"adds value\". </p> <p>\"It is not about cutting costs, it is about creating new products.\"</p>",
  "<p>Shares in French advertising company Havas fell almost 4% to \u20ac4.17 yesterday as fears that it could lose a key client outweighed its status as a takeover target. </p> <p>Intel Corp, the world's largest chip maker, said it was reviewing its global advertising account with the group's Euro RSCG unit and seeking bids for the estimated $300m (\u00a3168.6m) account. </p> <p>Analysts said the loss of the account would confirm the fragility of Havas's position in the United States. Intel is Havas's third largest client, representing about 3% of its revenue. Lehman analysts said if the account was lost \"it would be a sizeable blow and offset the much improved new business momentum over the summer\". </p> <p>Havas said the account was not yet lost. \"We are putting our best teams to work on it. It just means there will be a competition.\" </p> <p>The Intel decision comes as speculation continues over the future of Havas as a standalone group; it is viewed as a potential target after losing a bid to buy US rival Grey Global to WPP last month.</p>",
  "Tony Blair, his heart ticking steadily in 40C heat, looked down at the steps on which Gordon had been hacked to death after a prevaricating prime minister had failed to come to his rescue. But if he mused on any parallels between the fate of Gordon of Khartoum and Gordon of Kirkcaldy he was keeping it to himself. <p>Instead, he noticed, that the steps on which Gordon died were not as long as those in the film starring Charlton Heston. </p> <p>Mr Blair, in his first official appearance since his heart procedure and his promise to serve a full third term, did not seem to be feeling the pressure. He was not exactly in a stress-free environment. He had arrived in Khartoum in the sodden 4am gloom. </p> <p>At the presidential palace overlooking the Nile and the site of Gordon's death, Mr Blair was being escorted by a group of Sudanese ministers branded by the Americans as guilty of genocide and the murder of tens of thousands of Africans in the western province of Darfur. </p> <p>Despite their reputation, he had gently read the riot act to them, warning that the UN might yet cripple Sudan's economy with sanctions unless they tore up their centralised constitution. </p> <p>A little later he was to hurtle through the sultry humidity of Khartoum's traffic jams to catch a flight to Ethiopia. </p> <p>And looming over it all was the final report from the Iraq Survey Group announcing that it had found no weapons of mass destruction. A 500-day weapon hunt had turned up a blank. His great casus belli in Iraq was defunct. </p> <p>Yet at his press conference in the grounds of the British embassy, replete with tennis courts, swimming pool and green lawns, Mr Blair was confident, fluent and relaxed. </p> <p>After facing the first question from the British press about his health, he replied, in the mode of Oscar Wilde: \"I find there is nothing more conducive to quick recuperation and recovery than engaging with the British media. It has always been a tremendous pleasure and will always remain so.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair was then asked whether, if he was clearly very much alive, was he at least a dead duck. Mr Blair gave one of his whitewashed smiles before insisting he had every in tention of carrying on for a full third term. Quashing speculation that he might leave Downing Street early after the general election, he said: \"A full term is a full term and that is what it means.\" </p> <p>His remarks quashed the lingering hopes of Gordon Brown's supporters that Mr Blair will step down after two or so years. Instead No 10 is clearly putting much thought into the orderly handover at the close of a third term. The election for a new party leader might take only six weeks and the successor would be inheriting a clear programme from the Blair administration. </p> <p>On these occasions Mr Blair appears the master of his own house, convinced the British public will be mature enough to see that his long timetable towards resignation can work. </p> <p>No 10 makes a point of asserting that Mr Blair will retain his powers of patronage right to the end, a clear warning to any premature warring factions that they will meet the kind of grisly end that befell the other Gordon on the steps of the palace at Khartoum.</p>",
  "The capture of the medicines system by the pharmaceutical industry is an issue all EU countries face, and it extends to civil servants and patients' groups, as well as doctors. You rightly characterise the problem as one of corruption (Leader, October 5). Policy-makers have bought the idea that the primary function of the industry is as a driver of the European economy. Delivery of safe medicines for the public is a secondary concern. <p>The threat of Merck or GlaxoSmithKline leaving European shores for areas with lower regulatory standards appears to cause policy-makers far more sleepless nights than the presence of what they know to be unsafe pharmaceutical products.

  "<p>Rome: Total War<br> PC, \u00a339.99 The Creative Assembly/ Activision,<br> ***** </p> <p>With all the waiting for Doom 3 and Half-Life 2, the final game in the Total War trilogy crept up like the master tactician it is. Well, wake up, because if you're looking for the game of the year, you have two serious contenders here - for a turn-based and a real time strategy game. </p> <p>The strength of the Total War games was always the battles - panoramic beauties where soldiers fought like you imagine they once did: half stoic bravery, half blind panic. Even so, the new 3D engine is a revelation. The ease with which you can zoom in on soldiers is something others have tried but never pulled off this well. Consequently, the battles - featuring up to 5,000 men on each side - are as enthralling to play as to watch. </p> <p>The weakness was always the boring bits in between, and here's the big surprise, because these too have been overhauled. You now have a proper turn-based strategy game that is as fun to play as Rise of Nations, formerly the best in its genre. </p> <p>On the world map you can run your empire in six-month turns - developing towns, claiming resources, everything short of seizing control of the Senate, which forms the climax of the single-player game. Once you've completed that, there are 10 historical battles, two multiplayer modes and all the online support you want. </p> <p>As far as war games go, The Creative Assembly has raised the bar so high other developers must be reaching for the hemlock. <br> <strong> Mike Anderiesz</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Fable</strong><br> Xbox \u00a339.99 Bullfrog/Microsoft,<br> **** </p> <p> Peter Molyneux has been responsible for such fine games as Populous and Syndicate. So his latest offering, Fable, has been widely anticipated. This is a third-person action role-playing game (RPG) in the mould of the Zelda series. </p> <p>It starts rather slowly with a young boy, then takes off properly when he reaches adulthood. By choosing quests, players can decide what their hero becomes. But while other RPGs, most notably the fabulous Knights of the Old Republic, offered similar freedoms, the beauty here is in the reaction of the world's inhabitants. </p> <p>If you do the right thing - slay hoodlums, escort traders - then everyone will offer admiration, respect and love. Do the opposite and they'll cower in fear from your sword. </p> <p>As you show off your latest trophy to cheering villagers, it is easy to get a feeling for the lifelike world that Molyneux and his team were aiming for. But the meat of the game is exploration and combat. The latter is satisfying, but exploration is elementary, with obvious signposting and no room to deviate from pathways. </p> <p>The environments are expansive and convincing but the character graphics lack detail. Despite not reaching all the heights hoped for, Fable is innovative and hugely enjoyable. <br> <strong> Greg Howson </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Fifa Football 2005</strong><br> PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PC, \u00a339.99 Electronic Arts Sports<br> *** </p> <p> Fifa Football 2004 was EA Sports' nadir. Its chief innovation was an unusable \"after-touch\" gimmick, which it spent so long developing it was not finished properly in time for release. So fundamental features, such as the ability to alter the game's speed, were omitted. </p> <p>Happily, this year's effort is much better - although not good enough to reclaim top spot. The after-touch control has been ripped out and a more useful first-touch control, operated using the right analogue stick, installed. </p> <p>Excellent graphics, an improved, more realistic passing system, a free-kick system that operates in a logical manner and a Pro Evolution Soccer-like press-and-hold shooting system constitute the game's highlights. There is also support for online play across all platforms now that EA has begun to support Xbox Live. </p> <p>A career mode, in which you take the reins of a lowly club and work your way up to the Premiership, or favourite global league, is an intriguing addition, but controlling players who would be more at home on Hackney Marshes proves frustrating. </p> <p>However, there are still areas in which Pro Evolution Soccer remains superior - namely, off-the-ball player movement when going forward, and automatic player selection. This year's Pro Evolution Soccer will also be available for the Xbox. Fifa Football 2005 marks a return to form, but it is no undisputed world-beater. <br> Steve Boxer</p>",
  "<p>The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, countered fears of an imminent crash in the property market yesterday when it reported a sharp rise in house prices last month. </p> <p>To the incredulity of the City, the Halifax said the average price of a home in the UK rose 1.4% in September to just under \u00a3163,000. Over the past 12 months, house prices have risen by 20.5%, it added. </p> <p>The Halifax said the biggest increases in prices last month were in London and the south-east - the regions other surveys have pinpointed as suffering from the sharpest decline in market sentiment. </p> <p>Martin Ellis, the Halifax's chief economist, warned against reading too much into one month's figures and said the trend over the latest three months still pointed to the market coming off the boil. </p> <p>Prices in the third quarter of 2004 rose by 2.7%, well down on the 6.1% in the three months to June and the smallest quarterly increase since early 2001. Despite accounting for 80% of the 1.4% increase in prices across the country as a whole in September alone, London and the south-east were the weakest regions in the third quarter. </p> <p>Mr Ellis said evidence of a slowdown was now apparent across all regions. </p> <p>\"While prices continue to rise more rapidly in the north, there are now signs that house price inflation in this part of the country is also slowing following a period of very rapid growth as first-time buyers increasingly face similar difficulties to those in the south in buying a home.\" </p> <p>Howard Archer of Global Insight said: \"The sharp 1.4% monthly rise in the Halifax house price index in September is very surprising, even allowing for the fact that it followed a fall of 0.6% in August. </p> <p>\"The September rise seems very much at odds with most of the other housing market data and survey evidence, which has recently been consistently pointing to a slowdown in the market.\" </p> <p>Mr Archer said that a better guide was the Halifax index for August and September combined, which showed prices rising by 0.4% a month on average, well down on earlier in the year.</p>"
