  "The department of homeland security's de facto veto of the University of Notre Dame's appointment of the Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan to a chair in the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies is offensive, not least as a denial of academic freedom (An oft-repeated 'truth', August 31). This revocation of Ramadan's work visa bears the imprint of those influential supporters of Israel's rightwing government in the Pentagon. These pro-Sharon neocons have been at the centre of the Bush administration's foreign policy. <p>A close scrutiny of Ramadan's work reveals an erudite, provocative scholar; one committed to the further evolution of Islam's understanding of its revelation and religious practice. Moreover, he is concerned to facilitate the discussions that must ensue if Judaism, Christianity and Islam are to build mutual respect en route to developing some common ground. </p> <p>We must examine the tactics of Ramadan's accusers. While they offer no evidence that he is a threat to US security, he is readily charged with being anti-semitic - a tactic widely used by pro-Sharon elements in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and those in the Pentagon who would intimidate and silence critics of the current government of Israel. This tactic is being widely used by neoconservatives, for example Daniel Pipes, whose campuswatch website encourages students to report professors who contest Israel's policies. </p> <p>In short, criticism of Israel is now glibly equated with anti-semitism. (Ramadan's offence, inter alia, was to have rebuked French Jewish intellectuals for their silence on Israel's murderous tactics in the occupied territories.) What is more, it is not only Muslim leaders and other non-Jewish opponents of Israel's continued control and settlement of the territories who are targeted in this manner. Jews in the peace movements who protest Sharon's policies also find themselves smeared as anti-semitic, \"self-hating Jews\". <br><b>Prof Peter Walshe</b> <br>Fellow of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA </p> <p> Ramadan has pointed out that an oft-repeated assumption becomes the \"truth\". For that reason, not only is he now a terrorist sympathiser, but also his accusers, by withdrawing his visa, are maintaining the illusion that they are conducting a war on terror. They are thus neatly reversing the actual truth, while ensuring that the culture under attack, Islam, is never understood by the people whose leadership is intent on global hegemony. <br><b>David Clarke</b> <br>London</p>",
  "On the first day of the Republican convention not one speaker mentioned a domestic issue - not education, healthcare or the economy. Delegates were summoned back to another country, a past that began on 9/11. <p>It was a moment crystallising enduring national unity, that saw the emergence of a president whose strategy against terrorism required an invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>Anyone who believed other than the patriotic consensus wrought by the moral clarity of the president was being misled by the documentary filmmaker and prankster Michael Moore. </p> <p>The remembrance of things past was evoked by the two most erratic partisan Republicans now recasting themselves as the ultimate loyalists, perhaps because both still harbour wild and quixotic ambitions to become presidents themselves. </p> <p>Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain are outriders from the entire Bush social agenda, but neither are representatives of the evanescent moderate wing of the party, \"a dying breed\", as a retiring moderate Republican congressman lamented that day. </p> <p>In the afternoon, a radical conservative platform against stem-cell research, abortion and gay rights was approved by the convention without a murmur of dissent. </p> <p>Once the moderates of the north-east repelled rightwing insurgencies, sending them back into their dark woods to nurse their resentments. In 1960, the New York governor Nelson Rockefeller compelled the nominee Richard Nixon to accept his provisions for the platform, an agreement called the Treaty of Fifth Avenue, long recalled with bitterness by conservatives as evidence of pragmatic betrayal. </p> <p>Under Bush, the first Southern conservative American president since Jefferson Davis, the moderates are a nonentity, and the appearance of Giuliani and McCain was testament to the decline of the historic wing of the party. </p> <p>The moderate remnant that filled appointments in the Bush administration - the former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman as environmental protection agency administrator and corporate executive Paul O'Neill as the secretary of the treasury - have left in disillusionment. Colin Powell has become the invisible man. </p> <p>While the true powers of the party, such as the House majority leader Tom \"The Hammer\" DeLay, are like hidden imams in New York, Giuliani and McCain assume the stage. </p> <p>Giuliani's political reputation was rescued by his steady public performance on 9/11 and an unexpected favour from Bush. In the jungle of New York politics he had made a world of enemies. Beyond the Hudson, he was a pariah. </p> <p>When he dropped out of the race for Senate in 2000 with operatic flourish after jettisoning his second wife and parading his girlfriend before photographers, he was already doomed in the polls against Hillary Clinton. But when the planes struck the World Trade Centre towers, he became a national beacon of reassurance, in large part because President Bush was not to be seen for days. Giuliani's fame in the crisis rested on Bush's absence. </p> <p>Now he came to praise Bush's steadfastness. \"Let us write our own history,\" said Giuliani. Bush was no less than the reincarnation of Winston Churchill, who \"saw the dangers of Hitler while his opponents characterised him as a warmongering gadfly\". </p> <p>The Bush who ignored his presidential daily brief from the CIA of August 6 2001, entitled Bin Laden Determined to Strike Inside US - a memo described by the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, as \"speculative\" and containing only \"historic information\" - went down the memory hole. </p> <p>Bush was \"clear, precise and consistent\"; Kerry, Giuliani told his audience 11 times, was not. And, by the way, Saddam Hussein wasn't just removed because of WMD, but in the classic threat conflation of the Bush administration, because he was \"a pillar of support for global terrorism\"; despite one of the key findings of the 9/11 commission that he was not. McCain - in truth intensely disliked and distrusted by most Republicans, Bush's internal nemesis - now embraced him, raising a storm of questions. </p> <p>What does McCain want? \"Emperor has always appealed to me,\" he said, the day before the convention. One source close to him suggested that he nursed the idea that Bush might dump Dick Cheney for him. Others conjectured that this was a case of Stockholm syndrome. </p> <p>McCain, too, evoked the spirit of the 9/11 past. \"We were not two countries. We were Americans.\" The divisions that had split the country since went unmentioned - nearly half a million had marched against Bush the day before. </p> <p>The Iraq war, McCain explained, \"was between war and a graver threat. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Not our political opponents. And certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker.\" </p> <p>\"Now there are some who would like to rewrite history,\" Bush said on the subject of Iraq last year - \"revisionist historians is what I like to call them.\" </p> <p>In the past few days, however, his explanation has wandered. Now the turmoil in Iraq is a consequence of \"catastrophic success\". It is the speed of the military's victory that is at the root of the failures. </p> <p>\"Shock and awe\" was not the prelude to Paris, 1944. But at the convention, it is the revisionist history that is \"on message\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to Bill Clinton, and the Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Roger Urwin has certainly earned his \u00a31m salary in the eyes of shareholders with this neat deal to hive off four gas distribution businesses from his National Grid Transco group. As a business proposition for NGT, which sees far richer pickings further afield, reducing its exposure to Britain is something that should help the share price.</p> <p>Securing \u00a36bn from this deal and giving a \u00a32bn dollop of cash straight back to shareholders has delighted the City. The sale price is a 20% premium to the regulatory asset value - not bad considering it had a 10% discount when National Grid took over Lattice.</p> <p>But whether this deal should be nodded through by the regulator and the trade secretary is quite another matter.</p> <p>Safety must come first. After the electricity blackouts last year nobody should let the company push through major changes like this without crawling all over them.</p> <p>Will it mean a better deal for customers? NGT believes a larger number of smaller competing gas distribution firms will increase competition and push prices down. But at the prices they are paying, can the purchasers make the deals to produce sensible returns for shareholders as well as producing lower prices for customers? Or will prices have to go up to recoup the cash expended?</p> <p>The regulator, Ofgem, has already spoken of \"potential benefits\" of bringing in new competition but insists it has not given its blessing to the latest deal - and will not do so unless it is entirely convinced it will benefit customers. It's impossible to dig up the 275,000 kilometres of pipes to test what state they are in. Given the issues at stake, everything else should be done before Mr Urwin can move on to buying more electricity transmission businesses in America.</p> <p><strong>Lest we forget</strong><br></p> <p>A couple of months ago the City's view was that it would take draconian action from the Bank of England to slow down the housing market. Demand for mortgages was good, prices were rising strongly, potential buyers appeared impervious to the gradual tightening of monetary policy.</p> <p>But the mood in financial markets changes quickly, and perceptions have changed. Now the betting is on perhaps one more quarter-point increase from the Old Lady, probably in October, before a soft landing is achieved. The evidence from the Bank's own data is that approvals for mortgages are well down on their levels in the spring, and with buyers less gung-ho, prices are being affected as well.</p> <p>But hang on a bit. If, as seems likely, sentiment in the property market is affected by the perception of where rates are heading rather than simply a function of where they stand, what will happen when potential purchasers factor in that the peak in base rates may be 5%, rather than 6%?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is that there is a danger that re-emboldened house hunters will see a period of falling prices as an ideal buying opportunity. Demand for mortgages will rise as a result, providing a fresh leg to the boom. This, lest we forget, is what happened to the US equity market in the late 1990s, when holders of stock came to realise that their downside risk was limited by Alan Greenspan's willingness to cut interest rates at the first sign of trouble.</p> <p>The Bank has no desire to reflate the bubble, but nor does it want to turn a correction into a crash through monetary overkill. Yet its policy of tweaking could prove too little or too much. A soft landing is far from a done deal.</p> <p><strong>Private numbers</strong><br></p> <p>It is a month - pretty much - since HBOS admitted it was considering making a bid for Abbey National, its closest rival on the high street. HBOS, apparently, is still deciding whether it is worth trying to retest the competition authorities' view of the banking market in Britain and actually put its money on the table.</p> <p>While HBOS continues to prevaricate, somewhat publicly, the country's other big high street banks are probably doing their sums in private. One set of numbers is making some people in the banking industry wonder what Stephen Green, HSBC's chief executive, might be thinking in his Canary Wharf tower.</p> <p>HBOS has already caught up with HSBC when it comes to current accounts in Britain. It has 14% of the lucrative market, just like HSBC. However, HSBC has a mere 4% share of the mortgage market, compared with HBOS's 15% or more.</p> <p>Might HSBC, armed with its mountains of cash, be tempted by Abbey - despite its disdain for Britain's rules and regulations? Abbey's shareholders clearly hope so. They are distinctly unimpressed with the prospect of swapping one of their existing shares for one in Banco Santander Credit Hispano plus 31p. A counterbid - be it from HBOS, HSBC or anyone else, for that matter - at the very least might force Santander to increase its offer.</p> <p>But investors looking to HSBC for action could well be searching in the wrong direction. Mr Green and his colleagues are likely to find things are better outside the UK. Abbey shareholders hoping for a higher offer will be better off urging the HBOS boss James Crosby to put his money where his mouth is.</p>",
  "<p>We looked out across the Valley of Death, as Lord Raglan had looked 150 years earlier, before the charge of the Light Brigade on October 25, 1854. Rain drizzled down and the view was mistier than it had been then, so the landscape looked flattened out - but then, that seems to have been the mistake he made too.</p> <p>Olga, our battlefield guide, was dressed up in high Ukrainian fashion - leather jacket, winkle-picker toes reaching halfway to Kiev - which looked out of place on a rural hillside in the rain. But she knew her stuff, launching into a stirring Tennyson recital, in perfect English: </p> <p>\"Half a league, half a league,<br> Half a league onward,<br> All in the valley of Death<br> Rode the six hundred...\"</p> <p>I half expected the valley to be like one of those canyons the Lone Ranger gallops through, with Indians raining arrows down from the cliff tops. It's not that dramatic, but lethal enough if your enemy has cannon rather than bows and war paint. </p> <p>There are two fairly broad valleys running between modest hills and separated by a low ridge. From his viewpoint on a higher hill further off, Raglan, the British commander, spotted the Russians on the ridge hauling away British cannon they'd captured. This would never do - they might use them as evidence that they'd won - so he sent an order to his generals on the valley floor telling them to prevent it.</p> <p>He didn't realise that down below, they couldn't see these guns. All they saw was the Russian heavy artillery at the head of the northern valley, and this was what they concluded they were meant to attack. So off they trotted, as disciplined as if they were on parade, breaking into a gallop, and gradually being mowed down from three sides. \"C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre,\" observed a French marshal.</p> <p>It wasn't as suicidal as is sometimes supposed: 673 men rode out; 118 were killed and 127 wounded. (The loss of 360 horses was the real problem.) But it was a military disaster - as Tennyson, and Olga, noted: \"Someone had blundered.\" The blame was conveniently pinned on Captain Lewis Nolan, who carried Raglan's order to the generals but may have misinterpreted it; as the first to die, he was in no position to answer back.</p> <p>Now, the Valley of Death is a vineyard, growing in the rich earth for which Ukraine is famous. Bullets and badges still come to the surface in the soil occasionally, as do unexploded second world war bombs. A small white obelisk recalls those who fell.</p> <p>The battlefield was long off-limits not only to tourists but to locals too: in Soviet times the fleet, like its tsarist predecessor, was based at Sevastopol nearby, and Balaklava harbour was used for repairing submarines - in a cave, away from prying American satellites.</p> <p>But the Soviet Union has gone, replaced by independent Ukraine, which welcomes foreigners and their money to the Crimean peninsula, its Black Sea playground.</p> <p>You can see why the British used Balaklava's sheltered, winding harbour as a supply base. It now wants to be a tourist resort. The waterfront is being spruced up; buildings are getting a lick of paint. You can go into the hidden cave. But it all still has that ramshackle Soviet air. Down by the fishing boats, men sit fishing, and women sit selling snacks. The view is spoiled by a rusty floating dock, which will have to go if this is to become the St Tropez of the Black Sea.</p> <p>As for Sevastopol, founded by the ancient Greeks and also recently opened to the world, it now houses both Ukrainian and Russian fleets in its harbour. This will be the centre for Crimean war commemorations. The Earl of Cardigan, descendant of the Light Brigade commander, will be there with a tour group; the descendant of the overall cavalry leader, Lord Lucan, probably not.</p> <p>The city has a striking war attraction worth a visit: a 360-degree panorama painted on the inside wall of a circular building, depicting the 1854-55 British siege of the city. Its realistic detail artfully enhanced by three-dimensional artefacts in the foreground, it is 115 meters long and 14 metres high.</p> <p>Sevastopol was besieged again when the second world war came to Crimea. The best-known name from that era is Yalta, the health resort where Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill got together in 1945 to carve up the post-war world. </p> <p>This took place at the white, Italian renaissance-style Livadia Palace, in big gardens overlooking the sea, and you can still see the round table where the deal was signed, once Stalin had fooled the other two into thinking he'd allow a free Poland.</p> <p>Tsar Nicholas II, who built the palace as a summer home, was not the only Yalta visitor. Chekhov lived here, in a villa with some cherry trees, writing The Cherry Orchard. Khrushchev and Gorbachev had dachas along the coast, and it became more or less the only Soviet seaside resort, replete with socialist health spas. Locals were sniffy about the \"cotton tourists\" - the workers, who came in summer - preferring the \"velvet\" ones, the artists and professionals who turned up in autumn.</p> <p>Russians still flock in, along with Ukrainians and a smattering of other Europeans (a 50-mile trolleybus ride, the world's longest and arguably prettiest, goes to Simferopol, the nearest airport). Ringed by mountains and sea, the town's green, if a bit grubby in its back streets. It offers healthy nature walks, with Europe's highest waterfall, Uchan-su, almost 92m if it doesn't dry up in summer. The spas are still there. </p> <p>You can visit the Massandra vineyard, the golden-domed Alexander Nevsky cathedral, Chekhov's home, or the vaguely Moorish Alupka palace nearby, as well as taking daytrips to Balaklava. On a boat trip round the bay, you may find dolphins splashing in your wake. Restaurants are cheap and cheerful, though English isn't always spoken. Try the Swallow's Nest: the food is OK but the setting - it's a sort of mini-castle perched on a crag over the ocean - is spectacular.</p> <p>The traffic-free promenade by the sea, with palm trees and pastel-shaded buildings, is the heart of Yalta. The beach itself is nothing much, pebbles and concrete, but holidaymakers stroll by, stopping to watch chess matches, test bouncy castles, eat big Macs (opposite the statue of Lenin), or dress in 18th-century costume to pose for photographs in drawing rooms set up on the strand. </p> <p>On a warm summer evening, it's all very relaxed and civilised. You could be in a Greek or Italian town or even, in the dim light of dusk, somewhere on England's south coast. Ukraine, far away on the Black Sea, is part of Europe after all. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>John Thompson travelled with <a href=\"http://www.prospecttours.com\">Prospect Tours</a> (020 7486 5704).

  "<p>ENGLISH FOOTBALL: ABOUT TO GET WOOD?</p> <p>Whenever the Fiver has the misfortune to watch football in the pub, there's a 50/50 chance that a) we'll be stuck next to a Sloane who's more toothy than Shergar, and b) that said Sloane, having jumped on the Premiership bandwagon post-Euro 96, will spend the game tediously braying about his knowledge of 'soccer'. Which brings us neatly onto Clive Woodward, who, having announced his resignation as England's rugby union boss, has set his sights on our national game!</p> <p>\"My whole background is in football,\" explained a sheepish Woodward today, picking up an Adidas Roteiro and sending a huge garryowen deep into the 22. \"I love football and I go to as many games as I possibly can. I never had that passion for rugby I have for football. I never got into rugby in the same way.\" Which, if true, is quite a statement: for Woodward's obsession with union puts Elizabeth Taylor to shame.</p> <p>And Woodward, who was sent to a rugby-playing school by his father, wasn't finished there. Indeed, he was soon milking his assets like a particularly thirsty Swiss dairy farmer. \"I was forced into playing rugby because that's the only game the school played,\" he sobbed. \"And I hated it. I ran away a couple of times because of football. I didn't mind being at boarding school. I just hated not playing football.\"</p> <p>Still, surely no Premiership chairman would give Woodward a job quite yet would they? Er, what's that Rupert? \"Sir Clive's expressed an interest in getting into football and has looked at our academy and other aspects of the club,\" explained the Southampton chairman. \"If we can learn from him about motivation, improving individuals and becoming world-class, then great.

  "<p>In one of my favourite New Yorker cartoons, two women are pushing their children on the swings in a playground. One is saying: \"They grow up so slowly.\" This is funny to anyone who has spent hours watching children play in sand, and listened to elderly relatives telling you to treasure your children's infancy because it is over so fast. But the start of school is upon us, and I'm not laughing now. </p> <p>I can't think of my son's first days at school without a clenching in my stomach. Because he's going to a very nice local school, where I already know some of the parents and children, I haven't given it much thought. Now, suddenly, it feels as though once he is through those gates we'll never really get him back the way he was. His infancy will be officially over. Will he still climb into our bed at night? Will he still play with us? How quickly will our four-year-old clown become a self-conscious boy? I'm emotionally exhausted, just thinking about it. </p> <p>I console myself that he's only going into reception class, and that formal schooling doesn't start until next year, by which time he will be five and a half. When we looked round the school, reception looked colourful and comforting: tissue paper and glue rather than multiplication tables. Besides, he will only be staying until lunchtime for the first two weeks. But seeing him standing proudly in his new grey uniform trousers, there's no mistake: this is school, not glorified nursery. It is not optional, he has to be there, on time, every day, from now on. </p> <p>I am aware though that my son could use some structured learning. Since he stopped going to nursery a couple of months ago, he has been developing increasingly sophisticated imaginative games, and stares intently at the pages of books, trying to make out the words. </p> <p>In fact, many children, by this age, are looking forward to the next thing. Joanna Sargent's son, Barnaby, is four and a half, and is very excited about the prospect of school. \"He has outgrown playgroup and nursery. Emotionally and physically, he's ready,\" says Sargent. \"He keeps saying he is looking forward to going to big school, and he has met his teacher. Two older boys next door go to the same school, and he is anticipating being a big boy like them. He used to say, \"When I'm four I'll do such-and-such.' Now he says, 'When I'm 10 ... ' \" </p> <p>In spite of Barnaby's excitement, he faces big changes. \"In some ways he seems so little to be going to school full-time,\" says Sargent. \"Nursery was like a social club; now they're on their own. It will be a shock, having to share one adult between 15 of them.\" </p> <p>But it is not only Barnaby who will have to adjust. Sargent, who has a younger son aged two, is aware that the whole family has to grow up. \"I worry about the impact on his brother,\" she says. \"He is his little shadow, and he will really miss him - although he will have more of my undivided attention. Of course, now things are more serious: we can't just take the day off and go and see my mum, or take a holiday when we feel like it.\" </p> <p>Siobhan Tooley's daughter, Elena, will be four and a half when she starts school next week, and her family will be treating the event as a major rite of passage. \"The grandparents are coming up from Devon, and we will all go to the school gates with her on the first day,\" says Tooley. \"I'm dreading it. We will all be in tears. It was exactly the same on her first day at nursery - I'm always crying, and her father will be in bits, and my father cries easily too.\" </p> <p>Tooley, who is expecting her second baby, knows that Elena will take it all in her stride, but she is none the less devastated at the prospect of seeing her firstborn move on to the next stage of life. Knowing the school is a small, gentle, nurturing environment certainly helps, but it doesn't alter the fact that school will, from now on, play a central role in Elena's life. </p> <p>\"For me, it's such a big move - she will be there till she's 11. It's my baby. When I think about how this is the beginning of the end of our influence over her, it makes me feel guilty that I haven't spent more time with her ... but you can't go down that route.\" </p> <p>\"People minimise how big it's going to be, that first day of school,\" says Dr Janet Reibstein, lecturer in psychology at Exeter University and author of Staying Alive: a Family Memoir (Bloomsbury). \"These days, working parents are accustomed to separation from early on, but it's still a huge transition. You can always pull a child out of the system before that point, but after this, you share the child with the state, and there's no turning back. There will be no return to the original family unit as it was.\" </p> <p>Feelings of guilt over how much time you spent with them when they were little are common at this stage. \"This moment re-evokes all the ambiguity over the decisions you made about working and childcare, and some parents feel stricken that they missed all those years,\" says Reibstein. </p> <p>Most people can recall their own first day of school from the sensation it evokes in the pit of the stomach. But however alien and upsetting the associations of school buildings, according to Reibstein, it's important to hide your emotions from your child: \"They will need to know that you are steady and supportive. Most parents have experienced dropping off their child at nursery and the child crying. Now it starts anew, even bigger this time, because he's frightened. You walk away and you're alone. It can be devastating. People should be prepared for the enormity of that.\" </p> <p>There is absolutely no way I will be going to those school gates on my son's first day - I would be crying so hard he would wonder what I was letting him in for. With eight days to go, he is already asking if he can go to school instead of the park. As for most children of his age, school is a big adventure. At our parents' induction meeting, however, we were gently informed that some children take to primary school with great enthusiasm for three weeks, and then, perhaps understanding the permanence of the arrangement, become very unhappy. </p> <p>For those already tearful at the thought that my baby will never be mine in quite the same way again, it is particularly gruelling to be reminded that this is just the first stage of a process of gradual parting that takes 16 years to accomplish. \"This is a transition point,\" says Reibstein. \"You could see it as an opportunity to re-evaluate. This is the first big line to cross: once you get over this, it gets re-evoked at every single turning point.\" </p> <p>She has just dropped her son off for his final year at university. \"It made me feel what I felt the first time I dropped him off at school: they are only on loan to us. This is the first step. They are going on to someone else and then they are on their own.\"</p>",
  "I thought it would be helpful at the end of the summer break to set out in some detail the challenge ahead as I see it. <p>The key to renewing our political support for the coming years is policy. We must set out, as we started to do in June and July, a compelling modern prospectus for the country to make it stronger, fairer and more prosperous. </p> <p>There is one key test that every policy decision should pass: does it, in practical terms, advance and improve the lives of Britain's hard-working families in the future? Does it help provide opportunity and security for them in a world of change? </p> <p>This responsibility to address the future clearly is ever more important to us as the Tories flounder, incapable of the bold renewal, top to bottom, their party needs. </p> <p>Only Labour is facing the future with confidence. While others peddle the politics of pessimism and anxiety, Labour is forging ahead to build a Britain of all the talents, rooted in the values of opportunity, responsibility and fairness we share with the British people. </p> <p>Some were surprised at the breadth and depth of the five year strategies we set out in June and July for health, education, transport and law and order. But there was no reason for surprise. Renewing our ideas and policies - focused on the future and its challenges - has been one of our constant preoccupations as a New Labour government. We had been working on these strategies for a year, and they grew out of the investment and reform programmes already being implemented with a fair measure of success in each of these areas. </p> <p>There is widespread recognition that these five year strategies offer an ambitious, credible and practical prospectus for transforming our essential public services. It will be the same with the further policy we announce in the coming months.</p> <p>They also owed a great deal to the Big Conversation - the consultation and discussion exercise which Labour began nearly a year ago in all of the major areas of policy. </p> <p>Since last November there have been more than 200 Big Conversation events with ministers and more than 40,000 submissions to the party. I myself have taken part in a dozen or more events, and virtually every minister and Labour MP has been engaged in this unprecedented dialogue between a government and the public it represents. This too will continue. </p> <p>In our first two terms, we have met and largely overcome four of the key challenges facing Britain in 1997: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Economic stability replacing boom and bust - the longest period of economic growth since the Second World War; <br><b>\u00b7</b> High employment replacing mass unemployment - now the highest levels of employment ever, underpinned by a minimum wage; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Properly funded public services replacing underfunded public services - steadily improving health and education, in place of services which could not cope; <br><b>\u00b7</b> A new constitutional settlement replacing an outdated, centralised system of government - devolution to Scotland and Wales, the Human Rights Act, Freedom of Information, a Mayor and assembly for London. </p> <p>We have a record we can be proud of. But the political battleground will not be a debate about past achievements. It will be a fight for the future: how to meet the challenges which face us as a country; how to extend opportunity and security to all hard-working families; how to build a society in which no-one is left out. </p> <p>This is the work to be done and the task ahead. We are now set to focus relentlessly on the 7 key challenges facing Britain in 2004: <br><b>\u00b7</b> expanding economic and educational opportunity for all in an era of rapid global change and intense competition - so that the opportunities opened up by advanced skills and qualifications, available just to a minority in the past, become available to a larger and larger majority; <br><b>\u00b7</b> personalising public services so that they meet the aspirations of each citizen, while remaining universal and equitable; <br><b>\u00b7</b> tackling the problems of poor families and deprived neighbourhoods when the majority are relatively well off and the great majority are in work; <br><b>\u00b7</b> pursuing the tough law and order policy people rightly expect, in an era where, also rightly, people are zealous about basic civil liberties; <br><b>\u00b7</b> promoting retirement as an opportunity and not a threat, while also providing properly for the increasing ageing population when private pension provision is under pressure and the taxpayer base remains constant or in relative decline; <br><b>\u00b7</b> promoting a tolerant multi-cultural society while resisting extremism and tackling abuse of our asylum and immigration systems; <br><b>\u00b7</b> building international support for the action we need in an interdependent world, for example on climate change and Africa. </p> <p>We have started to set out a way forward to meet these challenges. Our forward strategies for the NHS, secondary education and law and order - published before the summer break - showed how under a Labour government public services will become increasingly personalised and consumer-driven, yet also open to all and not dependent on wealth. </p> <p>In each part of the public services it is now possible to see a future that works, underpinned by steady extra investment, new facilities, new technology, and an expanded and reformed workforce. <br><b>\u00b7</b> In the NHS, guaranteed choice options to reduce waiting times and improve quality for patients; new hospital suppliers; new primary care services including NHS Direct and walk-in centres. <br><b>\u00b7</b> In education, a new system of independent specialist schools and academies, with basic standards of literacy and numeracy achieved nationwide and a massive extension of teaching assistants and information technology to improve teaching. <br><b>\u00b7</b> In the criminal justice system, a return to community policing with new police Community Support Officers and tough measures to deal with prolific offenders and tackle anti-social behaviour and other problems. </p> <p>But this is only the start. Over the coming six months we will publish forward policies in each of the following areas: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Business and enterprise, including cutting the burden of regulation for small businesses and keeping Britain at the forefront of innovation and science; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Housing, increasing the supply of new housing and giving more help to people to get on the housing ladder; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Vocational education, improving skill training and preparation for modern apprenticeships within secondary education for young people with aptitudes to pursue this route, matching the success with which we already prepare young people for university; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Childcare, setting out a roadmap to universally available under-fives and childcare provision over the next decade in order to give families more choice about how to combine the pressures of work and bringing up a family, to provide better for young children, and to tackle poverty more effectively; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Welfare, including reform in areas such as Housing Benefit and Incapacity Benefit; extending opportunity to the 3m economically inactive who are too often written off; and developing new areas of welfare provision to meet future demands; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Public health, supporting people to make choices that lead to longer healthier lives; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Climate change and Africa, which we will be placing at the heart of Britain's G8 and EU presidencies next year to build international support for tackling these crucial global issues which we cannot solve alone; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Organised crime, with major legislation to establish a new Serious Organised Crime Agency to take on, in particular, the evils of drug and people trafficking; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Asylum and immigration: how we build a tolerant, fair and outward-looking Britain whilst tackling abuses, and paving the way for ID cards; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Local government, decentralising more power including a new approach enabling neighbourhoods to help deal at first hand with the street-level issues of most concern to local people, particularly anti-social behaviour, activities for teenagers, and the problems of the worst estates; <br><b>\u00b7</b> Pensions: how to provide the security people need to plan for and enjoy their retirement, in the face of longer life expectancy, a much less static working environment, and pressure on existing sources of pension income. </p> <p>This is an ambitious agenda. Taken together with the policy already published, it will offer a full and compelling prospectus to address the seven challenges I set out. In each case, the policies will be New Labour. They will be courageous in addressing the future by modern policy means, with no hang-ups for example about partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors as appropriate, or extending rights and responsibilities together. We will also be resolute in our values and our conviction that all, not an elite few, should benefit from the changes we make; that excellence and opportunity need not and cannot any longer be the preserve of a minority as we build a Britain of all the talents. </p> <p>This is not the time for caution in the face of future challenges - but for the boldness essential to renew Britain for the era of globalisation. Britain is getting better but we can be better still. The new policies we are setting out - on pensions, childcare, asylum, housing and many other areas, in addition to what we have already announced on heath, education and law and order - are the route map for that journey. </p> <p>Taken together, these policy proposals will make a practical difference to the lives of every individual and every family, showing how by our actions the country is not only fairer but the individual better off. Week by week, I and fellow ministers will set out this prospectus, focused on the priorities for which we were elected. That is our task ahead.</p>",
  "<p> <strong>Prologue</strong></p> <p> There was something different about the rain that night. I noticed it as I lay awake - a purposeful, remorseless drumming on the roof, as if determined to force its way into the house. It rained all night, the claustrophobic intensity of the downpour leaking insidiously into my dreams.</p> <p>The next day dawned bright and even warm, its weak autumnal sunshine driving away the uneasiness of the -previous night. But half a mile from my house, the Thames already looked very different. Instead of the usual slug- gish flow, the brown water was racing angrily by. Small whirlpools and eddies played in the strong current, and freshly-torn branches floated past.</p> <p>The wildlife too indicated that something was wrong: hundreds of earthworms, forced out of their holes by the water, were wriggling uselessly on the banks. Some of the lower watermeadows had been submerged by the rising river, and deep chalky puddles lined the towpath as I splashed through on my bike.</p> <p>It was almost as a challenge to the elements that I dragged a friend's kayak down to the riverbank, and - after a brief wobble of trepidation - launched myself into the water. The last thing I remember seeing, as I shot out into the strong current, was my bike propped against a -willow tree on the bank.</p> <p>As I sped downstream, it gradually dawned on me that I had made a mistake. I couldn't turn around without the risk of capsizing, and I didn't want to find myself flung into the water so close to the weir. I had already taken the right-hand fork at the island, under the 'Danger' sign that warned bigger boats away, and could hear the muffled roar of the rapids ahead.</p> <p>A few minutes later I could even smell the spray. I eased closer to the bank as the weir came into view, its ugly steel gates fully raised to let through the maximum volume of the swollen river. On the right bank, under a grove of poplars, was the grey concrete memorial to an Oxford University canoeing team who had lost their lives in the same spot almost a century before.</p> <p>As I should have known it would, the increasing current took me by surprise. I had aimed to pass opposite the weir by hugging the bank on the other side, and then continue on round to the main channel. But the tug was stronger now, and within a few seconds I was away from the bank and losing control. I tried to paddle backwards, but succeeded only in spinning round with a dangerous near--capsizing wobble. All the while the roaring waterfall moved inexorably closer.</p> <p>I dug the paddles in deeply, as if on a liquid treadmill. I pulled harder, gasping from both the exertion and the adrenalin, until the speed of my kayak began to gradually outpace the water flowing underneath.</p> <p>Nearing the bank again, I grabbed at an overhanging -willow branch. The whole thing snapped off - it's not called 'crack willow' for nothing - the surprise nearly catapulting me into the water. Instead I snatched at a handful of stinging nettles and thorny brambles, clinging to them with relief as I came in close to the bank and safety.</p> <p>For weeks afterwards the placid Thames became virtually unnavigable. Within hours of my ill-considered kayaking trip, much of the Botley and Abingdon roads - two of the principal traffic arteries leading into Oxford - were underwater. It didn't spill over from the river directly, but instead appeared spontaneously in low points along the road, -surging out from manhole covers and drains. In places the water was over a foot deep.</p> <p>Further towards the centre of town, Osney Island was also inundated: each house had sandbags across the front door, and small rivers were beginning to flow down some of the lower streets. On the other side of the road allotments were gradually disappearing under the muddy flood. Sightseers were savouring the unusual scene.</p> <p>A white-haired woman appeared on the towpath. 'It's all in the Bible,' she told me furtively, before scampering back behind her garden wall. 'This is the beginning of the end.'</p> <p>She wasn't the only one to feel something different in the air, that week back in autumn 2000. Radio phone-in shows echoed with a phrase that had been in the national sub-conscious for a long time, but which was now breaking out into the open: climate change. Long the preserve of only -scientists and environmental campaigners, the phrase began to reverberate in day-to-day conversations across the country. The British have always talked about the weather, but the weather was no longer behaving like it used to. Something was wrong.</p> <p>Even politicians showed signs of noticing it. Tony Blair flew to flooded areas in a helicopter, announcing to journalists his determination not just to improve flood defences but to 'tackle climate change at the international level', whatever that meant. Blair's deputy John Prescott paraded around in wellington boots, also looking suitably grim for the cameras. 'All these incidents of climate change are reminding everyone, wherever they are in developed or developing countries, that this affects us all,' he lectured sternly, hiding from the bucketing rain under a temporary shelter of reporters' umbrellas.</p> <p>As the rain poured down, the political climate was -changing too.</p> <p>Not being a scientist, I didn't know much about global warming, but I did know some of the basic facts. I knew that the Earth had warmed by over half a degree centigrade during the twentieth century. I knew that the rate of warming had doubled since the 1970s. And I knew that eight of the warmest years on record had occurred since 1990.</p> <p>I understood the underlying science which explained why this was happening: that every year six billion tonnes of the 'greenhouse gas' carbon dioxide pour into the atmosphere, and that this comes from familiar sources like car exhausts, power-station chimneys, domestic boilers and the destruction of forests. I knew that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen by a third since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and that those of another greenhouse gas, methane, had doubled. The science explained that these gases acted like the glass on a greenhouse, -preventing the sun's heat from radiating back into space.</p> <p>But it was all a bit too abstract, and I found it difficult to connect to my everyday reality. Was this why I hadn't seen a decent snowfall in years? Did it explain the floods too? Was it the reason why the weather was suddenly so hot that spring?</p> <p>As part of my work at OneWorld.net - where I spent five years - I had covered Hurricane Mitch in Central America, droughts and famines in Africa and Asia, the -catastrophic floods in Mozambique and the killer -mudslides in Venezuela. Did all of this also connect up into a bigger picture of global warming? I suspected it might, but it was only a suspicion, more of an intuition than a -conclusion based on any firm evidence.</p> <p>Although I wasn't sure how climate change might fit into it, my concern about the environment was a long-standing preoccupation. I grew up in a country being rapidly destroyed by economic 'growth' and ever-increasing consumption. I saw my local shops in Oxford struggling and then closing down once big supermarkets opened on the outskirts of town. I saw pubs with real heritage turned into heritage theme pubs, and streets turned into elongated car parks. I saw rat runs and road rage, and I coughed in the fumes of my own car in motorway traffic jams on the way to work.</p> <p>Then, spurred into action like many others during the mid-1990s, I climbed trees and dug tunnels to try and stop the building of yet another road. I loved the tall trees, the clear streams and the shaded wild garlic meadows, and something inside me snapped every time I heard the chainsaws and saw the old oaks and beeches come crashing down. I'd grown up trusting that things would generally get better, and that 'progress' worked. Now I wasn't so sure. Even in itself the destruction seemed senseless - but what if it was presaging a wider destruction, giving birth to a -society which would poison itself for decades into the future as well?</p> <p>After the Newbury Bypass was completed, I drove through it, trying to recognise landmarks on either side of the open concrete wound. I saw it fill up with traffic, every car pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And I joined the activists' reunion on the day we blocked the road with a banner and hurled stones down onto the crisp new tarmac from the lifeless earthworks all around.</p> <p>But what if I'd been missing the bigger picture? What if the real Newbury Bypass tragedy wasn't just that a forest in Berkshire was destroyed, but that an island in the Pacific was drowned or a Nicaraguan family swept away in a flash flood? What if the local was the global after all? My work at OneWorld had given me an insight into the wider world, and I felt the connection, but it was a hazy picture.</p> <p>It wasn't long before I would start seeking answers. My journey had almost begun.</p> <p>I spent that Christmas at my parents' small farm in Llangybi, North Wales. It was still raining, and I had to complete the trip up the coast from Machynlleth by bus, because the railway track was cut by flooding (an increasingly frequent occurrence, according to the bus driver). On Christmas Eve my father and I spent the day stretching new fencing around one of the sheep fields, stabbing the rocky earth with a long iron bar to make holes for the wooden posts.</p> <p>On clear days there is a glorious panorama from Snowdon in the north down to Cadair Idris and even Pembrokeshire in the south, but we could see nothing, just mist and relentless soaking drizzle. Even the sheep looked miserable and bedraggled as they nibbled at the close-cropped grass. We worked almost in silence, pulling out muddy stones by hand and banging the posts in quickly before the narrow holes filled with water from the saturated ground.</p> <p>My mother had a fire blazing in the living-room stove when we came back in, and with my brother and sisters also having arrived we sat down for the customary family slideshow. My father set up the projector, whilst I moved a painting to make enough white space for the image. He'd selected slides of Peru, where the whole family had lived during his overseas geological posting between 1979 and 1982.</p> <p>The projector whirred, and there we all were, back in 1980 - my brother Richard, just a few weeks old, yelling in a pram outside the house; my little sister Suzanne looking startled in a flowery dress; my elder sister and I naked and tanned on a dark-sanded Pacific beach, building sand-castles; then all of us in the Peruvian Andes, the snowy peaks of the Cordillera Blanca towering behind us. I'd seen the pictures dozens of times, but I was still entranced. My father flicked on to a field trip he'd done the same year with his geologist colleagues into a place called Jacabamba.</p> <p>'That's my altitude record,' he commented gruffly, over a slide of a pristine snowfield, gleaming brilliant white in the tropical sun. 'Five thousand, two hundred metres.' The -projector whirred again, revealing an enormous fan-shaped glacier looming over a small lake. Icebergs were floating in it, having tumbled down from the glacier above. It was a spectacular sight.</p> <p>'What a place!' I breathed.</p> <p>'I loved it. Incredibly hard work, carrying drilling -equipment around to take rock samples, and then spend- ing freezing nights in those crappy old orange tents. But I loved it.'</p> <p>'It may not be the same now. I've heard that glacial retreat in the tropical Andes is pretty rapid.'</p> <p>'Perhaps. But that was a pretty big glacier. Once an -iceberg that calved off it into the lake created a huge set of waves which washed away half our equipment. There were ice avalanches coming down from above the whole time.' He paused. 'Still, maybe it has changed. I don't suppose I'll ever go back, but I wonder what it does look like now.'</p> <p>'I wonder . . .' I repeated slowly.</p> <p>Then I said nothing for a while. I'd just had an idea.</p> <p>That night, in many ways, marked the start of the journey described in this book. Over the next three years I would visit five continents, searching for the fingerprints of global warming. I would interview Mongolian herders, Alaskan Eskimos, Tuvaluan fishermen, American hurricane chasers and a whole army of scientists, all with an urgent story to tell. It was a story, when I first heard it, that left me both shocked and inspired: shocked, because of how few outsiders realised the magnitude of what was unfolding, and inspired because there was still time to avert a far greater catastrophe.</p> <p>This global quest wouldn't be easy, and at one point it would almost cost me my life. But at the end of it all I knew I would return to Wales with a box of slides. I would draw the curtains. I would set up the projector. And then I would answer my father's question.</p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 Mark Lynas, 2004. All rights reserved. No reproduction without permission </p>",
  "<p><strong>The New Civil Service</strong></p> <p>I watched two men enter the lobby of the Hotel Mowafaq. </p> <p>Most Afghans seemed to glide up the centre of the lobby staircase with their shawls trailing behind them like Venetian cloaks. But these men wore western jackets, walked quietly and stayed close to the banister. I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was the hotel manager.</p> <p>'Follow them.' He had never spoken to me before.</p> <p>'I'm sorry, no,' I said. 'I am busy.'</p> <p>'Now. They are from the government.'</p> <p>I followed him to a room on a \u00dfoor which I didn't know existed and he told me to take off my shoes and enter alone in my socks. The two men were seated on a heavy black-wood sofa, beside an aluminium spittoon. They were still wearing their shoes. I smiled. They did not. There were lace curtains across the windows and there was no electricity in the city, so it was dark in the room.</p> <p>'Chi kar mikonid?' What are you doing? asked the man in the black suit and collarless Iranian shirt. I expected him to stand in the normal way, shake hands and wish me peace. He remained seated.</p> <p>'Salaam aleikum,' Peace be with you, I said and sat down. </p> <p>'Waleikum a-salaam. Chi kar mikonid?' he repeated quietly, leaning back and running his fat manicured hand along the purple velveteen arm of the sofa. His bouffant hair and goatee beard were neatly trimmed. I felt conscious of not having shaved in eight weeks. </p> <p>'I have explained what I am doing many times to His Excellency, Yuzu\u00de, in the Foreign Ministry,' I said. 'I was told to meet him again now. I am late.'</p> <p>A pulse was beating strongly in my neck. I knew it would be visible. I tried to breathe more slowly. Neither of us spoke. After a little while, I looked away. The thinner man drew out a small new military radio, said something into it and straightened his stiff grey wool jacket over his traditional shirt. I didn't need to see the shoulder holster. I had already guessed that they were members of the Security Service. They did not care what I said or what I thought of them. They had watched people through hidden cameras in bedrooms, in torture cells and on execution grounds. They knew that, however I presented myself, I could be reduced. But why had they decided to question me? In the silence, I heard a car reversing in the courtyard and then the \u00derst slow notes of the call to prayer.</p> <p>'Let's go,' said the man in the black suit. He told me to walk in front. On the stairs, I passed a waiter whom I had spoken to. He turned away. I was led to a small Japanese car, parked on the dirt forecourt. The paintwork of the car was new and it had been washed recently. They told me to sit in the back. There was nothing in the pockets or on the \u00dfoor of the car. It looked as though it had just come from the factory. Without saying anything, they turned on to the main boulevard. </p> <p>It was January 2002. The American-led coalition was ending its bombardment of the Tora Bora complex; Usama Bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar had apparently escaped; operations in Gardez were beginning. The new government, which had taken over from the Taliban, had been in place for two weeks. The laws banning television and female education had been dropped. Political prisoners had been released, refugees were returning home. Some women were coming out without veils. The UN and the US military were running the basic infrastructure and food supplies. There was no frontier guard and I had entered the country without a visa. The Afghan government seemed to me hardly to exist. Yet these men were apparently already well established. </p> <p>The car turned into the Foreign Ministry, and the gate guards saluted and stood back. As I walked up the stairs, I felt that I was walking unnaturally quickly and that the men had noticed this. A secretary showed us straight into Mr Yuzu\u00de's of\u00dece without knocking. For a moment Yuzu\u00de stared at us and did not move from his desk, then he stood, straightened his baggy pinstriped jacket, and showed the others to the most senior position in the room. The two men walked slowly down the linoleum \u00dfoor. They looked at the furniture, which Yuzu\u00de had managed to assemble since he had inherited an empty of\u00dece: the splintered desk, the four mismatched \u00deling cabinets in different olive greens and the stove, which made the room smell strongly of petrol.</p> <p>The week I had known Yuzu\u00de comprised half his career in the Foreign Ministry. A fortnight earlier he had been in Pakistan. The day before he had given me tea and a boiled sweet, told me he admired my journey, laughed at a photograph of my father in his kilt and discussed Persian poetry. This time he did not greet me but instead sat in a chair facing me and asked, 'What has happened?' </p> <p>Before I could reply the man with the goatee cut in, 'What is this foreigner doing here?'</p> <p>'These men are from the Security Service,' said Yuzu\u00de.</p> <p>I nodded. I noticed that Yuzu\u00de had clasped his hands together and that his hands, like mine, were trembling slightly.</p> <p>'I will translate to make sure you understand what they are asking,' continued Yuzu\u00de. 'Tell them your intentions. Exactly as you told me.'</p> <p>I looked into the eyes of the man on my left. 'I am planning to walk across Afghanistan. From Herat to Kabul. On foot.' I was not breathing enough to complete my phrases. I was surprised they didn't interrupt. 'I am following in the footsteps of Babur, the \u00derst emperor of Mughal India. I want to get away from the roads. Journalists, aid workers and tourists mostly travel by car but I. . . '</p> <p>'There are no tourists,' said the man in the wool jacket, who had not yet spoken. 'You are the \u00derst tourist in Afghanistan. It is midwinter: there are three metres of snow on the high passes, there are wolves and this is a war. You will die, I can guarantee. Do you want to die?'</p> <p>'Thank you very much for your advice. I note those three points.' I guessed from his tone that such advice was intended as an order. 'But I have spoken to the Cabinet,' I said, misrepresenting a brief meeting with the young secretary to the Minister of Social Welfare. 'I must do this journey.' </p> <p>'Do it in a year's time,' said the man in the black suit.</p> <p>He had taken from Yuzu\u00de the tattered evidence of my walk across South Asia and was examining it: the clipping from the newspaper in western Nepal, 'Mr Stewart is a pilgrim for peace'; the letter from the Conservator, Second Circle, Forestry Department, Himachal Pradesh, India: 'Mr Stewart, a Scot, is interested in the environment'; from a District Of\u00decer in the Punjab and a Secretary of the Interior in a Himalayan state and a Chief Engineer of the Pakistan Department of Irrigation requesting 'All Executive Engineers (XENs) on the Lower Bari Doab to assist Mr Stewart, who will be undertaking a journey on foot to research the history of the canal system'.</p> <p>'I have explained this,' I added, 'to His Excellency the Emir's son, the Minister of Social Welfare, when he also gave me a letter of introduction.'</p> <p>'From His Excellency Mir Wais?'</p> <p>'Here.' I handed over the sheet of headed paper which I had received from the Minister's secretary. 'Mr Stewart is a medieval antiquary interested in the anthropology of Herat'.</p> <p>'But it is not signed.'</p> <p>'Mr Yuzu\u00de lost the signed copy.' </p> <p>Yuzu\u00de, who was staring at the ground, nodded slightly.</p> <p>The two men talked together for a few minutes. I did not try to follow what they were saying. I noticed, however, that they were using Iranian not Afghan Persian words in their conversation. That and their clothes and their manner made me think they had spent a great deal of time with the Iranian intelligence services. I had been questioned by the Iranians, who seemed to suspect me of being a spy. I did not want to be questioned by them again. </p> <p>The man in the wool jacket said, 'We will allow him to walk to Chacharan. But our gunmen will accompany him all the way.' Chacharan was halfway between Herat and Kabul and about a fortnight into my journey.</p> <p>The villagers with whom I was hoping to stay would be terri\u00deed by a secret police escort. This was presumably the point. But why were they letting me do the journey at all rather than expelling me? I wondered if they were looking for money. 'Thank you so much for your concern for my security,' I said, 'but I am quite happy to take the risk. I have walked alone across the other Asian countries without any problems.' </p> <p>'You will take the escort,' said Yuzu\u00de, interrupting for the \u00derst time, 'that is non-negotiable.'</p> <p>'But I have introductions to the local commanders. I will be much safer with them than with Heratis.'</p> <p>'You will go with our men,' he repeated.</p> <p>'I cannot afford to pay for an escort. I have no money.' </p> <p>'We were not expecting any money,' said the man in the wool jacket. </p> <p>'This is non-negotiable,' repeated Yuzu\u00de. His broad knee was now jigging up and down. 'If you refuse this you will be expelled from the country. They want to know how many of their gunmen you are taking.' </p> <p>'If it is compulsory, one.'</p> <p>'Two... with weapons,' said the man in the dark suit, 'and you will leave tomorrow.' The two men stood up and left the room. They said goodbye to Yuzu\u00de but not to me.</p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 Rory Stewart, 2004. All rights reserved. No reproduction without permission</p>",

  "<p><strong>Mutants [An introduction]</strong></p> <p>We had heard that a monster had been born at Ravenna, of which a drawing was sent here; it had a horn on its head, straight up like a sword, and instead of arms it had two wings like a bat's, and the height of its breasts it had a fio [Y-shaped mark] on one side and a cross on the other, and lower down at the waist, two serpents, and it was a hermaphrodite, and on the right knee it had an eye, and its left foot was like an eagle. I saw it painted, and anyone who wished could see this painting in Florence.</p> <p> It was March 1512, and a Florentine apothecary named Lucca Landucci was writing up his diary. He had much to write about. Northern Italy was engulfed by war. Maximillian of Germany and Louis XII of France were locked in combat with the Spanish, English and Pope Julius II for control of the Venetian Republic. City after city was ravaged as the armies traversed the campagna. Ravenna fell eighteen days after the monster's birth. 'It was evident,' wrote Landucci, 'what evil the monster had meant for them! It seems as if some great misfortune always befalls the city when such things are born.'</p> <p>Landucci had not actually seen the monster. It had been starved to death by order of Julius II, and Landucci's account is of a drawing that was on public display in Florence. That image was among the first of many. Printed woodcuts and engravings spread the news of the monster throughout Europe, and as they spread, the monster acquired a new, posthumous, existence. When it left Ravenna it had two legs; by the time it arrived in Paris it had only one. In some prints it had bat wings, in others they were more like a bird's; it had hermaphrodite genitalia or else a single large erection. It became mixed up with the images of another monster born in Florence in 1506, and then fused with a medieval icon of sinful humanity called 'Frau Welt' - a kind of bat-winged, single-legged Harpy who grasped the globe in her talons.</p> <p>As the monster travelled and mutated, it also accreted ever more complex layers of meaning. Italians took it as a warning of the horrors of war. The French, making more analytical effort, interpreted its horn as pride, its wings as mental frivolity and inconstancy, its lack of arms as the absence of good works, its raptor's foot as rapacity, and its deformed genitalia as sodomy - the usual Italian vices in other words. Some said that it was the child of a respectable married woman; others that it was the product of a union between a nun and a friar. All this allegorical freight makes it hard to know what the monster really was. But it seems likely that it was simply a child who was born with a severe, rare, but quite unmysterious genetic disorder. One can even hazard a guess at Roberts's syndrome, a deformity found in children who are born with an especially destructive mutation. That, at least, would account for the limb and genital anomalies, if not the two serpents on its waist and the supernumerary eye on its knee.</p> <p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, monsters were everywhere. Princes collected them; naturalists catalogued them; theologians turned them into religious propaganda. Scholars charted their occurrence and their significance in exquisitely illustrated books. In Germany, Conrad Lycosthenes produced his Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon (1557, later translated as The Doome, calling all men to judgement); from France came Pierre Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses (History of prodigies, 1560-82) and Ambroise Par\u00e9's Des monstres et prodiges (Monsters and prodigies, 1573). A little later, the Italians weigh in with Fortunio Liceti's De monstrorum natura caussis et differentiis (On the nature, causes and differences of monsters, 1616) and Ulisse Aldrovandi's Monstrorum historia (History of monsters, 1642).</p> <p>In an age in which religious feelings ran high, deformity was often taken as a mark of divine displeasure, or at least of a singularly bad time in the offing. Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses, which is especially rich in demonic creatures, has a fine account not only of the unfortunate Monster of Ravenna but also of the Monster of Cracow - an inexplicably deformed child who apparently entered the world in 1540 with barking dogs' heads mounted on its elbows, chest and knees and departed it four hours later declaiming 'Watch, the Lord Cometh.' Allegory was a sport at which Protestant scholars excelled. In 1523 Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon published a pamphlet in which they described a deformed 'Monk-Calf' born in Freiburg and another creature, possibly human, that had been fished out of the Tiber, and interpreted both, in vitriolic terms, as symbols of the Roman Church's corruption. Catholics responded by identifying the calf as Luther.</p> <p>By the late 1500s, a more scientific spirit sets in. In Des monstres, his engagingly eclectic compendium of nature's marvels, the Parisian surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 lists the possible causes of monsters. The first entry is 'The Wrath of God', but God's wrath now seems largely confined to people who have sex with animals (and so produce human-horse/goat/dog/sheep hybrids) or during menstruation (Leviticus disapproved). Luther's Monk-Calf also appears in Des monstres, but shorn of its anti-papal trappings. It is, instead, a monster of the 'imagination', that is, one caused by maternal impressions - the notion, prevalent in Par\u00e9's day and still in the late nineteenth century, that a pregnant woman can, by looking at an unsightly thing, cause deformity in her child. Like most of the other causes of deformity that Par\u00e9 proposes (too much or too little semen, narrow wombs, indecent posture), the theory of maternal impressions is simply wrong. But it is rational insofar that it does not appeal to supernatural agents, and Des monstres marks the presence of a new idea: that the causes of deformity must be sought in nature.</p> <p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century, teratology - literally, the 'science of monsters' - begins to leave the world of the medieval wonder-books behind. When Aldrovandi's Monstrorum historia was published posthumously in 1642, its mixture of the plausible (hairy people, giants, dwarfs and conjoined twins) and the fantastic (stories taken from Pliny of Cyclopes, Satyrs and Sciapodes) was already old-fashioned. Fortunio Liceti's treatise, published in 1616, is mostly about children with clearly recognisable abnormalities - as can be seen from the frontispiece where they are assembled in heraldic poses. True, they include a calf born with a man's head and, inevitably, the Monster of Ravenna. But even this most terrible of creatures is almost seraphic as it grasps the title-banner in its talons.</p> <p>There is a moment in time, a few decades around the civil war that racked seventeenth-century England, when the discovery of the natural world has a freshness and clarity that it seems to have lost since. When vigorous prose could sweep away the intellectual wreckage of antiquity and simple experiments could reveal beautiful new truths about nature. In Norfolk, the physician and polymath Sir Thomas Browne published his Pseudodoxia epidemica, or, enquiries into very many received tenents and commonly presumed truths (1646). In this strange and recondite book he investigated a host of popular superstitions: that the feathers of a dead kingfisher always indicate which way the wind is blowing, that the legs of badgers are shorter on one side than the other, that blacks were black because they were cursed, that there truly were no rainbows before the Flood - and concludes, in each case, that it isn't so. In another work, his Religio medici of 1642, he touches on monsters. There is, he writes, 'no deformity but in Monstrosity; wherein notwithstanding, there is a kind of Beauty. Nature so ingeniously contriving the irregular parts, as they become sometimes more remarkable than the principal Fabrick.' This is not precisely a statement of scientific naturalism, for Browne sees the works of nature - all of them, even the most deformed - as the works of God, and if they are the work of God then they cannot be repugnant. It is, in a few beautiful periods, a statement of tolerance in an intolerant age.</p> <p>At Oxford, William Harvey, having triumphantly demonstrated the circulation of the blood, was attempting to solve the problem of the generation of animals. In 1642, having declared for the King, Harvey retreated from the turmoil of civil war by studying the progress of chick embryos using the eggs of a hen that lived in Trinity College. The Italians Aldrovandi and Fabricius had already carried out similar studies, the former being the first to do so since Aristotle. But Harvey had greater ambitions. Charles I delighted in hunting the red deer that roamed, and still roam, the Royal Parks of England, and he allowed Harvey to dissect his victims. Harvey followed the progress of the deer embryo month by month, and left one of the loveliest descriptions of a mammalian foetus ever written. 'I saw long since a foetus,' he writes, 'the magnitude of a peascod cut out of the uterus of a doe, which was complete in all its members &amp; I showed this pretty spectacle to our late King and Queen. It did swim, trim and perfect, in such a kind of white, most transparent and crystalline moysture (as if it had been treasured up in some most clear glassie receptacle) about the bignesse of a pigeon's egge, and was invested with its proper coat.' The King apparently followed Harvey's investigations with great interest, and it is a poignant thought that when Charles I was executed, England lost a monarch with a taste for experimental embryology, a thing not likely to occur again soon.</p> <p>The frontispiece of Harvey's embryological treatise, De generatione animalium (1651), shows mighty Zeus seated upon an eagle, holding an egg in his hand from which all life emerges. The egg bears the slogan Ex Ovo Omnia - from the egg, all - and it is for this claim, that the generation of mammals and chickens and everything else is fundamentally alike, that the work is today mostly remembered, even though Harvey neither used the slogan himself nor proved its truth. Harvey has some things to say about monstrous births. He revives, and queries, Aristotle's claim that monstrous chickens are produced from eggs with two yolks. This may not seem to amount to much, but it was the expression of an idea, dormant for two millennia, that the causes of monstrosity are not just a matter for idle speculation of the sort that Par\u00e9 and Liceti dealt in, but are instead an experimentally tractable problem.</p> <p>It was, however, a contemporary of Harvey's who stated the true use of deformity to science - and did so with unflinching clarity. This was Francis Bacon. Sometime Lord Chancellor of England, Bacon comes down to us with a reputation as the chilliest of intellectuals. His ambition was to establish the principles by which the scientific inquiry of the natural world was to be conducted. In his Novum organum of 1620 Bacon begins by classifying natural history. There are, he says, three types of natural history: that which 'deals either with the Freedom of nature or with the Errors of nature or with the Bonds of nature; so that a good division we might make would be a history of Births, a history of Prodigious Births, and a history of Arts; the last of which we have also often called the Mechanical and the Experimental Art'. In other words, natural history can be divided into the study of normal nature, aberrant nature and nature manipulated by man. He then goes on to tell us how to proceed with the second part of this programme. 'We must make a collection or particular natural history of all the monsters and prodigious products of nature, of every novelty, rarity or abnormality.' Of course, Bacon is interested in collecting aberrant objects not for their own sake, but in order to understand the causes of their peculiarities. He does not say how to get at the causes - he simply trusts that science will one day provide the means.</p> <p>Bacon's recommendation that 'monsters and prodigious products' should be collected would not have startled any of his contemporaries. Princes such as Rudolf II and Frederick II of Austria had been assembling collections of marvels since the mid-1500s. Naturalists were at it too: Ulisse Aldrovandi had assembled no fewer than eighteen thousand specimens in his musem at Bologna. Bacon's proposal that the causes of oddities should be investigated was equally conventional. The depth of his thinking is, however, apparent when he turns to why we should concern ourselves with the causes of deformity. Bacon is not merely a physician with a physician's narrow interests. He is a philosopher with a philosopher's desire to know the nature of things. The critical passage is trenchant and lucid. We should, he says, study deviant instances 'For once a nature has been observed in its variations, and the reason for it has been made clear, it will be an easy matter to bring that nature by art to the point it reached by chance.' Centuries ahead of his time Bacon recognised that the pursuit of the causes of error is not an end in itself, but rather just a means. The monstrous, the strange, the deviant, or merely the different, he is saying, reveal the laws of nature. And once we know those laws, we can reconstruct the world as we wish.</p> <p>In a sense this book is an interim report on Bacon's project. It is not only about the human body as we might wish it to be, but as it is - replete with variety and error. Some of these varieties are the commonplace differences that give each of us our unique combinations of features and, as such, are a source of delight. Others are mere inconveniences that occupy the inter-tidal between the normal and the pathological. Yet others are the result of frank errors of development, that impair, sometimes grievously, the lives of those who have them, or simply kill them in early infancy. At the most extreme are deformities so acute that it is hardly possible to recognise those who bear them as being human at all.</p> <p>Bacon's recommendation, that we should collect what he called 'prodigious births', may seem distasteful. Our ostensible, often ostentatious, love of human diversity tends to run dry when diversity shades into deformity. To seek out, look at, much less speak about deformity brings us uncomfortably close to naive, gaping wonder (or, to put it less charitably, prurience), callous derision, or at best a taste for thoughtless acquisition. It suggests the menageries of princes, the circuses of P.T. Barnum, Tod Browning's film Freaks (1932), or simply the basements of museums in which exhibits designed for our forebears' apparently coarser sensibilities now languish.</p> <p>Yet the activity must not be confused with its objective. What were to Bacon 'monsters' and 'prodigious births' are to us just part of the spectrum of human form. In the last twenty years this spectrum has been sampled and studied as never before. Throughout the world, people with physiologies or physiognomies that are in some way or other unusual have been catalogued, photographed and pedigreed. They have been found in Botswana and Brazil, Baltimore and Berlin. Blood has been tapped from their veins and sent to laboratories for analysis. Their biographies, anonymous and reduced to the biological facts, fill scientific journals. They are, though they scarcely know it, the raw material for a vast biomedical enterprise, perhaps the greatest of our age, one in which tens of thousands of scientists are collectively engaged, and which has as its objective nothing less than the elucidation of the laws that make the human body.</p> <p>Most of these people have mutations - that is, deficiencies in particular genes. Mutations arise from errors made by the machinery that copies or repairs DNA. At the time of writing mutations that cause some of us to look, feel, or behave differently from almost everyone else have been found in more than a thousand genes. Some of these mutations delete or add entire stretches of chromosome. Others affect only a single nucleotide, a single building block of DNA. The physical nature and extent of the mutation is not, however, as important as its consequences. Inherited disorders are caused by mutations that alter the gene's DNA sequence so that the protein it encodes takes a different, usually defective form, or simply isn't produced at all. Mutations alter the meaning of the genes.</p> <p>Changing the meaning of a single gene can have extraordinarily far-flung effects on the genetic grammar of the body. There is a mutation that gives you red hair and also makes you fat. Another causes partial albinism, deafness, and fatal constipation. Yet another gives you short fingers and toes, and malformed genitals. In altering the meanings of genes, mutations give us a hint of what those genes meant to the body in the first place. They are collectively a Rosetta Stone that enables us to translate the hidden meanings of genes; they are virtual scalpels that slice through the genetic grammar and lay its logic bare.</p> <p>Interpreting the meaning of mutations requires the adoption of a reverse logic that is, at first, counter-intuitive. If a mutation causes a child to be born with no arms, then, although it is tempting to speak of a gene for 'armlessness', such a mutation is really evidence for a gene that helps ensure that most of us do have arms. This is because most mutations destroy meaning. In the idiolect of genetics, they are 'loss-of-function' mutations. A minority of mutations add meaning and are called 'gain-of-function'. When interpreting the meaning of a mutation it is important to know which of these you are dealing with. One way to tell is by seeing how they are inherited. Loss-of-function mutations tend to be recessive: they will only affect a child's body when it inherits defective copies of the gene from both its parents. Gain-of-function mutations tend to be dominant: a child need have only one copy of the gene in order to see its effects. This is not an invariable distinction (some dominantly inherited mutations are loss-of-function) but it is a good initial guide. Gain or loss, both kinds of mutations reveal something about the function of the genes that they affect, and in doing so, reveal a small part of the genetic grammar. Mutations reverse-engineer the body.</p> <p>Who, then, are the mutants? To say that the sequence of a particular gene shows a 'mutation', or to call the person who bears such a gene a 'mutant', is to make an invidious distinction. It is to imply, at the least, deviation from some ideal of perfection. Yet humans differ from each other in very many ways, and those differences are, at least in part, inherited. Who among us has the genome of genomes, the one by which all other genomes will be judged?</p> <p>The short answer is that no one does. Certainly the human genome, the one whose sequence was published in Nature on 15 February 2001, is not a standard; it is merely a composite of the genomes of an unknown number of unknown people. As such, it has no special claim to normality or perfection (nor did the scientists who promoted and executed this great enterprise ever claim as much for it). This arbitrariness does not diminish in the slightest degree the value of this genomic sequence; after all, the genomes of any two people are 99.9 per cent identical, so anyone's sequence reveals almost everything about everyone's. On the other hand, a genome nearly three thousand million base-pairs long implies a few million base-pairs that differ between any two people; and it is in those differences that the interest lies.</p> <p>If there is no such thing as a perfect or normal genome, can we find these qualities in a given gene? Perhaps. All of our thirty thousand genes show at least some variety. In the most recent generation of the world's inhabitants, each base-pair in the human genome mutated, on average, 240 times. Not all of these mutations change the meanings of genes or even strike genes at all. Some alter one of the vast tracts of the human genome that seem to be devoid of sense. Containing no genes that contribute to the grammar of the body, these regions are struck by mutation again and again; the scalpel slices but with no consequences to body or mind. Other mutations strike the coding regions of genes but do not materially alter the sequences of the proteins that they encode; these, too, are silent.</p> <p>Of the mutations that alter the meaning of genes, a small minority will be beneficial and will become, with time, more common. So common, in fact, that it is hardly fair to refer to them as 'mutations', and instead we call them 'variants' or, more technically, 'polymorphisms'. In Africa, the 32 polymorphism of the CCR5 gene is currently increasing in frequency because it confers resistance to human immunodeficiency virus and so to AIDS. This is something new, but many polymorphisms are ancient. They are the stuff from which human diversity is made. They give us variety in skin colour, height, weight and facial features, and they surely also give us at least some of our variety in temperament, intelligence, addictive habits. They may cause disease, but mostly the diseases of old age such as senile dementia and heart attacks.</p> <p>How common does a mutation have to be before it becomes a polymorphism? The answer is a bit arbitrary, but if a variant sequence has a global frequency of 1 per cent or more it is assumed that it cannot have caused much harm in its history, and may even have conferred some benefit to its carriers. By this criterion, at least one polymorphism has been detected in about 65 per cent of the human genes in which they have been sought, but some genes have dozens. This variety should not overwhelm us. Most human genes have one variant that is far more common than all others, and it is quite sensible to speak of that variant as being normal, albeit only in the statistical sense.</p> <p>Perfection is far more problematic. The only reason to say that one genetic variant is 'better' than another is if it confers greater reproductive success on those who bear it; that is, if it has a higher Darwinian fitness than other variants. It is likely that the most common variant is the best under most circumstances, but this cannot be proved, for the frequencies of gene variants are shaped by history, and what was best then need not be best either now or in the future. To prefer one polymorphism over another - or rather to prefer the way it surfaces in our looks - is merely to express a taste. By this I mean the sort of claim made by the great French naturalist George Leclerc Buffon when he asserted that, for their fair skin and black eyes, the women of the Caucasus Mountains were lovelier than all others. Or when Karen Blixen eulogised the beauty of the Masai morani. Recognition of, even a delight in, human genetic diversity does not, however, commit us to a thorough-going genetic relativism. Many of the mutations that batter our genomes do us harm by any criterion.</p> <p>Each new embryo has about a hundred mutations that its parents did not have. These new mutations are unique to a particular sperm or ovum, were acquired while these cells were in the parental gonads and were not present when the embryo's parents were themselves embryos. Of these hundred mutations, about four will alter the meaning of genes by changing the amino acid sequences of proteins. And of these four content-altering mutations, about three will be harmful. To be more precise, they will affect the ultimate reproductive success of the embryo, at least enough to ensure that, with time, natural selection will drive them to extinction.</p> <p>These are uncertain numbers: the fraction of deleterious mutations can only be estimated by indirect methods. But if they are at all correct, their implications are terrifying. They tell us that our health and happiness are being continually eroded by an unceasing supply of genetic error. But matters are worse than that. Not only are we each burdened with our own unique suite of harmful mutations, we also have to cope with those we inherited from our parents, and they from theirs, and so on. What is the total mutational burden on the average human being? The length of time that a given mutation will be passed down from one generation to the next depends on the severity of its effects. If we suppose that an average mutation has only a mildly deleterious effect upon reproductive success and so persists for a hundred generations, an estimate of three new mutations per generation yields the depressing conclusion that the average newly conceived human bears three hundred mutations that impair its health in some fashion. No one completely escapes this mutational storm. But - and this is necessarily true - we are not all equally subject to its force. Some of us, by chance, are born with an unusually large number of mildly deleterious mutations, while others are born with rather few. And some of us, by chance, are born with just one mutation of devastating effect where most of us are not. Who, then, are the mutants? There can be only one answer, and it is one that is consistent with our everyday experience of the normal and the pathological. We are all mutants. But some of us are more mutant than others.</p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 Armand Marie Leroi, 2004. All rights reserved. No reproduction without permission</p>",

The export index fell to 47.6 in August - its lowest level for almost two years - from 53.2. </p> <p>\"Demand from overseas clients remains generally strong, but there are signs it is cooling - especially from the US, China and Japan,\" Chris Williamson, an economist at NTC Research, which compiled the PMI survey, said. </p> <p>Howard Archer, of Global Insight, said: \"Overall, the evidence suggests that the manufacturing sector's recovery is continuing, but the sector is unlikely to match the 0.9% quarter-on-quarter expansion achieved in the second quarter in the third. </p> <p>\"With signs of a housing market slowdown becoming more prevalent, and consumer spending moderating in July and August, the chances are rising that the Bank of England will not raise interest rates again this year.\"</p> <p>The Bank's monetary policy committee, which meets next week, has raised borrowing costs by 1.25 basis points to 4.75%. Until recently, analysts had been expecting another quarter-point rise by the end of the year.</p> <p>More signs today emerged that the five interest rate rises since last November were finally making an impact on the booming property market. The Nationwide building society said house prices rose by just 0.1% in August, their weakest monthly performance since October 2001.</p> <p>The Nationwide survey followed a report by the Bank yesterday which showed that July saw the lowest number of monthly mortgage approvals for house purchase since before the start of the war in Iraq.</p> <p>\"Although August's price rise was the lowest monthly increase for almost three years, a better indication of the underlying trend is the average rate of price growth over the last three months,\" Alex Bannister, Nationwide's group economist, said. </p> <p>\"On this measure, price growth has moderated rather than slumped, with prices rising by an average of 1% per month compared with an average of 1.7% per month over the previous three months.\"</p> <p>Mr Bannister said he expected one more increase in interest rates, taking borrowing costs to 5% by the end of the year. \"The consensus now seems to be that rates are nearing their peak,\" he added.</p>",
  "In a deeply polarised America, where virtually every value has become fair game for criticism, there is one that remains sacrosanct: the American dream - the idea that anyone, regardless of the circumstances to which they're born, can make of their lives as they choose, by dint of diligence, determination, and hard work. The problem is that one-third of all Americans, according to a recent national survey, no longer even believe in it. Some have lost faith because they worked hard all their lives only to find hardship and despair. Others question the very dream itself, arguing that its underlying tenets have become less relevant in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. For the first time, the American dream no longer serves as the rallying point for everyone in America. <p>Meanwhile, a new European dream is beginning to capture the world's imagination. That dream has now been codified in the form of a draft constitution and Europeans are currently debating whether or not to ratify its contents and accept its underlying values as the core of a new Europe. </p> <p>Twenty-five nations, representing 455 million people, have joined together to create a \"United States\" of Europe. Like the United States of America, this vast political entity has its own empowering myth. Although still in its adolescence, the European dream is the first transnational vision, one far better suited to the next stage in the human journey. Europeans are beginning to adopt a new global consciousness that extends beyond, and below, the borders of their nation-states, deeply embedding them in an increasingly interconnected world. </p> <p>Americans are used to thinking of their country as the most successful on earth. That's no longer the case: the EU has grown to become the third largest governing institution in the world. Though its land mass is half the size of the continental US, its $10.5 trillion GDP now eclipses the US GDP, making it the world's largest economy. The EU is already the world's leading exporter and largest internal trading market. The comparisons are even more revealing when it comes to the quality of life. For example, in the EU, there are approximately 322 physicians per 100,000 people; in the US there are only 279 physicians per 100,000 people. The average life-span in the 15 most developed EU countries is now 78.2 years compared to 76.9 years in the US. When it comes to wealth distribution - a crucial measure of a country's ability to deliver on the promise of prosperity - the US ranks 24th among the industrial nations. All 18 of the most developed European countries have less income inequality between rich and poor. </p> <p>Europeans often remark that Americans \"live to work\", while they \"work to live\". The average paid vacation time in Europe is now six weeks a year. By contrast, Americans, on average, receive only two weeks. When one considers what makes a people great and what constitutes a better way of life, Europe is beginning to surpass America. </p> <p>Nowhere is the contrast between the European dream and the American dream sharper than when it comes to the definition of personal freedom. For Americans, freedom has long been associated with autonomy; the more wealth one amasses, the more independent one is in the world. One is free by becoming self-reliant and an island unto oneself. With wealth comes exclusivity and with exclusivity comes security. For Europeans, freedom is not found in autonomy but in community. It's about belonging, not belongings. </p> <p>Americans are more willing to employ military force to protect perceived vital self-interests. Europeans favour diplomacy, economic aid and peacekeeping operations to maintain order. The American dream is deeply personal and little concerned with the rest of humanity. The European dream is more systemic, bound to the welfare of the planet. </p> <p>That isn't to say that Europe is a utopia. Europeans have become increasingly hostile towards asylum seekers. Anti-semitism is on the rise, as is discrimination against Muslims and other religious minorities. While Europeans berate America for having a trigger-happy foreign policy, they are willing, on occasion, to let the US armed forces safeguard European security interests. And even its supporters say that the EU's governing machinery, based in Brussels, is aloof from the citizens it supposedly serves. </p> <p>The point, however, is not whether the Europeans are living up to their dream. We Americans have never fully lived up to our own dream. What's important is that a new generation of Europeans is creating a radical new vision for the future. </p> <p>The UK is uniquely positioned to play a bridge role between the older American dream and the newly emerging European dream. Were it to cast its fate with the EU, while maintaining its special relationship with America, the UK could help create an ideological synergy between the two great superpowers of the 21st century. The UK could champion the entrepreneurial sensibilities and sense of individualism that is so characteristic of the US way of life, within the corridors of Europe. At the same time, the UK could help Americans better understand the need to expand their dream beyond individual self-interests to include the general welfare of the larger community and a global consciousness more befitting a globalising world. </p> <p>But the UK will never fully enjoy the advantages that come with being part of a shared political space if it continues to straddle the fence. The US and the EU are going to increasingly realise that their own prosperity and security depends on their cooperation, if for no other reason than the fact that they each represent the two largest markets in the world. What can the UK offer either of these megapowers that they can't better secure by dealing directly with each other? </p> <p>Instead of seeing full membership in the European Union in purely negative terms, as something being forced on them by the flow of global events, the UK ought to consider Europeanisation as a historic opportunity, with vast potential benefits for the British people. By being a critical part of a larger European agenda, the UK can play a leadership role in helping shape the European dream and laying the groundwork for a truly global consciousness in the coming century. Equally importantly, the UK's ability to draw America and Europe closer together depends on it being squarely in the EU fold. </p> <p>The human race is becoming connected. Nation-state boundaries, once a source of security in an unpredictable world, are increasingly seen as too restrictive to accommodate the many new identities, affiliations and loyalties that make up a network way of life. The question for the British people, and peoples everywhere, is whether to be constrained inside old political containers, or to reach out and establish new political arrangements more suitable to an era of ever greater interdependence. </p> <p>The real lesson in a globally connected world is that no people can any longer exist as an island unto themselves. The UK, too, will have to choose to be part of a larger political affiliation. The only question is whether it will make its home with America or Europe. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>This is an edited extract from <a href=\"mailto:jrifkin@foet.org\">Jeremy Rifkin</a>'s new book, The European Dream: How Europe's Vision of the Future is Quietly Eclipsing the American Dream, published by Polity Press.</p>",

  "The World Bank launched an unprecedented exercise in public consultation yesterday on whether it should back a project to build a dam in Laos on a tributary of the Mekong river. <p>More than 200 officials from the Lao and Thai governments, businessmen, environmentalists and academics began debating whether the bank should underwrite a \u00a3675m project to build the dam, being developed by a consortium of Lao, Thai, French and Italian investors. </p> <p>Bank officials claim the \"detailed and intensive\" level of consultation is setting a new benchmark for project assessment that should be copied worldwide. </p> <p>Critics argue that the consultation is a waste of time because, they believe, the bank has decided to support the project, its first massive dam in East Asia for more than a decade. </p> <p>If the Nam Theun 2 dam goes ahead the impoverished Lao economy stands to gain \u00a31.1bn in revenue from the electricity generated, most of which will be exported to Thailand. </p> <p>Some 70% of the Lao population lives on less than \u00a31.10 a day. Set against the potential benefit from the dam is the disruption to one of east Asia's most important waterways and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. </p> <p>Peter Stephens, a World Bank spokesman, admitted that there had been \"problems and issues\", but said that \"the pluses outweigh the minuses\". </p> <p>\"[The project] will give the country the money to invest in areas where money is desperately needed, without having to borrow it,\" he told the Guardian. \"It will strengthen the systems and institutions of government that will see the money used productively.\" </p> <p>Other claimed benefits include a 23,000-acre protected area that will be created near the dam site and continued monitoring of the Lao government's spending to minimise corruption. </p> <p>However, 6,000 people will be have to be moved. Fields belonging to a further 40,000 villagers will be flooded. Fish stocks will be affected and the ecosystem of the Mekong delta downstream will be damaged. </p> <p>Mr Stephens claimed that a final decision would not be taken until after workshops in Paris, Washington, Tokyo and the Lao capital Vientiane in the next month. </p> <p>Dr Juree Vichit-Vadakan, the independent moderator of yesterday's event, said the Lao government's presentation was impressive. \"They made a very strong case for a need of the revenue from the project to take care of the environment, reduce poverty and improve social infrastructure,\" she told the Guardian. Several groups opposing the dam had made a persuasive argument that Thailand's power needs would not be as great as the consortium and bank had estimated, and that the resulting energy surplus would discourage conservation and the use of renewable resources. </p> <p>Thailand has agreed to buy 95% of the power generated by Nam Theun 2. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Nam Theun 2 Power Company, Ludovic Delplanque, described the workshop as a success because \"the objective was to make sure the concerns are listened to and addressed to our best possible ability\". </p> <p>\"However, some concerns cannot be addressed\", he told the Guardian, \"because some people are simply anti-dam and would like a completely different approach.\" </p> <p>One of the most vocal critics of the bank's involvement is the International Rivers Network. It believes five recent hydropower projects have been a major failure in Laos, leaving \"a legacy of destroyed livelihoods and damaged ecosystems\", according to a report published in March. </p> <p>\"As a result of dams, tens of thousands of Laotians lack sufficient food to eat, clean water to drink and income to meet basic needs,\" the study alleged. \"The government has taken few steps to improve the livelihoods of communities.\" </p> <p>Premrudee Daonroung of the Thailand-based Project for Ecological Recovery was disappointed by the World Bank's perceived bias towards the project. \"It was clear from the atmosphere that the decision has already been taken,\" she told the Guardian. \"The bank 100% supports the project.\"</p>",
  "Poor rural migrants have become like characters in the folk-tales and fables they no longer tell their children: fleeing the countryside to escape the evil spirits of want and poverty, they find the old enemies lying in wait for them in the urban slums which are their destination. <p>Global poverty is in flight; not because it is being chased away by wealth, but because it has been evicted from an exhausted, transformed hinterland. The UN estimates rural populations have reached their peak, but there will be a further 2 billion urban settlers in the next 30 years. About 70% of these will live in slums, adding to the 920 million already there. </p> <p>Poor people have taken their bundles to the unwelcoming cities of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Few go in search of bright lights or easy pickings. Most depart in sorrowful resignation, because they have dependants - children and elderly parents - to sustain and insufficient means to do so. </p> <p>The earth they farmed, addicted to fertiliser and pesticide, no longer yields a surplus to sell in the market. Water is contaminated, irrigation channels are silted up, well water polluted and undrinkable. In any case, land was sold for a dowry, or to finance a family member in the Gulf, from where she sent her domestic servant's wages each month until the contract expired. Land was taken by government for a coastal resort, a golf course, or under the pressure of structural adjustment plans to export more agricultural products. </p> <p>Other aspects of rural life had also decayed. There had been no repairs to the school building. The health centre had closed. Forests, where people had always gathered fuel, fruit and bamboo for house repairs, had become forbidden zones, guarded by men in the livery of some private semi-military company. </p> <p>Poverty itself mutates during the journey to the cities. People leave places where food is produced, paradoxically, to escape hunger. When they see city markets, it seems they have indeed arrived at a place of plenty. But the cash required for food always outruns the day's labour. Vegetables dug freely out of a patch of earth now cost half a day's income. </p> <p>Neighbours and relatives in the city find a precarious site where a shelter can be built out of industrial detritus - close to the bubbling black water of a stagnant canal, on the dangerous scree of a stony slope. In some cities, factory work is available; others have urbanised without becoming industrial; and from some industry has already departed. The poorest areas evoke images of flimsy makeshift settlements: cities have become refugee camps for the evictees of rural life. </p> <p>No one gives work. People turn themselves into rickshaw drivers or domestic servants; buy a handful of bananas and spread them for sale on the pavement; offer themselves as porters and labourers. This is the informal sector. In India, less than 10% of people are employed in the formal economy, and this is being reduced by the privatisation of state enterprises. </p> <p>In the slums, latrines surrounding polluted ponds are shared by 50 families. The nearest water tap is a 15-minute walk away, and water flows only in the early hours. Money for illegal electricity connections must be paid to the prosperous family in a house on the main road. Children suffer from strange fevers. Money set aside for food must be spent on medicines to stop the shiverings of dengue and malaria. The remains of the daily meal are tied in a plastic bag from the roof to keep it from the rats that run through the night. </p> <p>Security comes to mean a padlock on the door, rather than the vigilant eyes of neighbours. Uncertainty redefines itself as insecurity of tenure, the illegality of what were to have been sanctuaries from eviction. Insufficiency is structured into the very wages which were to have been the means of deliverance, but which prove unable to procure the necessities of life. </p> <p>In 1950, 18% of people in developing countries lived in cities. This rose to 40% in 2000. By 2030 it will reach 56%. More than 40% of these are already living in slums. The urban poor are emblematic of the 21st century. Neo-liberal policies have quickened the growth of slums, as subsidies for agriculture and nutrition have been withdrawn, effective health and education have become marketed commodities, water has been privatised and sanitation all but abandoned. </p> <p>The world must learn once more that the minimal state leads to maximum disturbance. If rural poverty is relatively dispersed and powerless, global laissez-faire towards an urbanisation without livelihood sets up pathologies of violence, the consequences of which are not difficult to foresee. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jeremy Seabrook's book, Consuming Cultures, Globalisation and Local Lives, is published by New Internationalist </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Recently, quite out of the blue, Anthony Douglas had a phone call from a woman who introduced herself as the widow of his natural father. Douglas had never met her - indeed, he had met his father only once, fleetingly, 25 years ago - but she had belatedly discovered his existence and told him he had four half-brothers who were keen to make his acquaintance. </p> <p>\"So here I am, at 55, inheriting potentially another set of relationships in this kind of complex web,\" says Douglas, who was adopted at birth. \"At my age, you are a bit wary of it, but for them, of course, it's new and exciting. And it is for me in many ways: it's the last piece of information about it, but it's taken 55 years to complete all the pieces of the jigsaw.\" </p> <p>This complexity of Douglas's background enables him, he feels, to empathise with the fractured structures of so many modern families. It has set him in good stead during a successful career in social work and is likely to prove even more relevant in his new and highly challenging role, which he starts today, as chief executive of the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service, better known as Cafcass. </p> <p>As well as empathy, his experience of adoption - by no means an unqualified success, on his assessment - has no doubt contributed to a passion for helping families in crisis and, above all, children in need. \"It's highly emotive work,\" he says, admitting to being something of a driven character. \"I don't see how you can manage it neutrally. It's not like manufacturing kitchen units.\" </p> <p>Douglas is sure to need every drop of that passion in the weeks and months ahead. Cafcass, set up in 2001 to coordinate representation of children's interests before the courts, had what he calls a \"disastrous\" first two years. He thinks that its performance since then has been somewhat better, and that the organisation has not had sufficient credit for that, but that it still needs to undergo a process of cultural change in key parts of its operation. </p> <p>Following radical intervention by ministers, Cafcass has been moved under the umbrella of the Department for Education and Skills. The arms-length body has been given a more realistic budget of \u00a3107m - up almost 13% - and a new board chaired by Lady Pitkeathley, the Labour peer who is seen as having a wise head and a safe pair of hands. </p> <p>Douglas, who was headhunted for the job from Suffolk county council, where he had spent less than two years as director of social care and health, has never previously worked with Pitkeathley, but he recognises a kindred spirit. \"She wants to be associated with success, not failure, and wants to develop a stronger culture of delivery, urgency and corporate ownership of Cafcass,\" he says. \"We both believe in a supportive management culture for frontline staff, but equally we are both determined to get the work done without any nonsense.\" </p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, there was a good deal of nonsense in Cafcass's early years. Douglas, who was closely monitoring developments from a standpoint of chair of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, believes that the management process became widely discredited. This led to creation of parallel managements, most damagingly among the guardians ad litem appointed by courts to represent children. </p> <p>\"Many staff don't say 'we' as much as 'Cafcass', as if it's an external or independent organisation,\" he observes. \"What I want to get to very quickly is a 'Team Cafcass' approach, where all of our staff, whether employed or self-employed [as many guardians are], think of it as their organisation that they are proud to be part of and are positive about.\" </p> <p>As an avid cricketer, Douglas is keen also that his team should play to its strengths. That means a switch, in line with the recent green paper on parental separation, from what he terms \"commentating\" to more short-term intervention - \"sorting\" - in stressed families. That, in turn, implies a shift of emphasis from public law cases, typically involving children being taken into care, to private child custody issues. </p> <p>But how can that be achieved without leaving gaps on the public side? </p> <p>Douglas is convinced there is much duplication of effort by Cafcass staff and local authority social workers, assessing and working on behalf of the same child. Even before he took up his post, he was holding preliminary discussions with local government groups about sharing resources through formal compacts. </p> <p>\"There's a long-held principle of tandem representation, and the independence of the guardian is, of course, sacrosanct in law,\" he says. \"But a lot of time is sometimes spent duplicating a good local authority assessment rather than perhaps using a different validation process and spending time on those cases - which I guess would be more private law cases - where active intervention would really help change children's lives. </p> <p>\"It's like anything in life: if you have got an excellent piece of work, an excellent piece of plumbing, say, you don't get a second plumber to come along and rip it apart and do it again.\" </p> <p>As a notably thoughtful care professional - he is currently writing his fourth book - Douglas reflects on two epiphanies along the route of his career. The first came as a social services team manager in the 1980s, when he realised that his staff-centred view of the world was wrong and that his focus should be on outcomes for users of the services. The second came at Suffolk, where he learned the critical distinction between leadership and management and the importance of the former. Symbolically, he had no office of his own at county hall. </p> <p>At Cafcass, he intends generally to lead rather than manage, but has identified a couple of management tasks: implementing a 10-year pay and workforce strategy, which will include incentives to ensure that more experienced staff focus on more complex cases; and pushing through changes to create what he calls \"Cafcass local\" and \"Cafcass direct\", delivering services readily accessible to people who need short-term help and intervention. \"That implies a step change, from what is primarily a care management service to a faster, flexible front-end service,\" he says. </p> <p>Expect, too, that Cafcass will become a much more transparent organisation. Before he settled to social work, Douglas dabbled in journalism, and his policy has always been one of openness to the media. He is already in talks with an independent television producer about filming some early intervention work. </p> <p>He is in no doubt that the approach of \"certain newspapers\" contributes to the poor image of social work in Britain - an image that he says astonishes overseas staff he has recruited to Suffolk. But he insists: \"My job, and that of other leaders of the profession, is to treat that as a fact of life and to get as much publicity about the positive work that's done, nine times out of 10, as about the mistakes and catastrophes that do happen.\" </p> <p>Douglas thinks it will take two or three years to get Cafcass back on track to becoming a world-class service. Despite marked improvement in its performance, there continue to be cases of children waiting to be allocated guardians - particularly in regional \"hot spots\" - and the organisation is on average allocating 56% of public law cases within two days of request, against a target of 70% by March next year.

  "<p>Only professional jeremiahs of overpopulation, such as Crispin Tickell and Jonathan Porritt, noticed the forecast last week that Britain would have 4 million extra people by 2025, plus a further 1.5 million by 2050 - a 10% rise in the lifetime of our children. The UK is the only major European population still growing. </p> <p>Public debate on population is so preoccupied with the social impact of immigration that nobody asks how we will support 66 million consumers of energy, housing and driving space on the roads. Already we have 631 people per square mile in the UK (993 in England) - more than twice as many as France, and the highest density in Europe after the Netherlands. China's population density is 352. </p> <p>Yet the new forecast from the US-based Population Reference Bureau attracted no comment from our government, which has barely begun to shape a population policy, as distinct from an immigration policy, which it says sets \"no upper limits\". </p> <p>Tickell and Porritt are patrons of the Optimum Population Trust (OPT), which takes a deeper look at the issue. It argues that the government's hopes for sustainable development in food, clean water, healthy soil and a stable climate will be dashed if the population is not reduced from 60 million to 52.5 million by 2050, and possibly to 30 million by 2121. </p> <p>The OPT demands firm action against unintended pregnancies, particularly among teenagers, and extra support for the raising of small families. The average British woman chooses to have 1.7 children; in Italy and Spain it is 1.2. </p> <p>Unabashed at sharing some opinions with the British National Party, the UK Independence Party and the Daily Mail, the OPT wants net immigration brought down to zero. Immigration has been the main contributor to recent UK population growth and is projected to account for more than 80% of future growth. </p> <p>Two years ago, 360,000 people left the UK and 513,000 came in - a net immigration of 153,000. The government expects the influx to be lower when the figures for 2003 are released, but natural increase - the excess of births over deaths - is expected to rise from 62,500 in 2002 to 83,000. </p> <p>The OPT has been a voice in the wilderness, but in recent weeks officials have begun replying to its emails and even inviting its input on the future of farming. Tickell, who is director of Oxford's Green College environmental policy centre, does not support OPT's ambition to reduce net immigration to zero, but he does want to stem the flow by discouraging migrants and refugees from coming to Europe. He argues: \"We should give aid at the European level to the countries where refugees originate - especially aid in population policies.\" </p> <p>Porritt agrees that most of the expected increase will be caused by immigration, \"plus a bit of demographic pressure\". But, unlike the OPT, he accepts the government's current immigration policy for humanitarian reasons and because immigrants will help the economy. \"I don't think they're letting too many people in,\" he says. \"Population talk is far too tied up with immigration and racism. The fact is that we are nearly in balance. We're not showing hundreds of thousands coming in.\" </p> <p>Porritt, who drafted the Ecology party's demographic policy in 1976, can claim to be the doyen of the population prophets. Now, as chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission, he is an influential critic who blames the government for not having a population policy. </p> <p>\"The next sustainable development strategy paper is due in March, but will population even feature in it? This government is not doing enough to make a difference. We need more energetic policies on fertility management, which could give us a net reduction even with the present rate of immigration. People should be made to understand that their commitment to the world includes not having too many children.\" </p> <p>The OPT appears relatively untroubled that its two famous patrons disagree with its aim to stop immigration in its tracks. The trust's starkest warnings come from its research coordinator, Andrew Ferguson, a retired airline pilot who calculates that Britain will only be sustainable when its population is brought down to 20 million or, at most, 30 million. \"Only by extravagant use of fossil fuel can we support 60 million people, let alone 65 million,\" Ferguson says. \"As we run out, we will have to go back to old methods of making energy, and that will need lots more space - wood burning, hydroelectric and, to a far lesser extent, wind and solar.\" </p> <p>Most OPT pundits belittle the prospects of renewable energy - \"too many energy fantasists\", says Ferguson. Most accept the revival of nuclear power as inevitable, but insist that the drawbacks, especially the hazards of radioactive waste, make it a least-worst option and no substitute for curbs on population. </p> <p>Ferguson, who sits on teenage pregnancy panels, points out that, with 40,000 such births a year, the UK leads Europe in the field, \"beating even Holland - and we are six times worse than Holland\". </p> <p>The trust shows little embarrassment at sharing some of its platform with anti-immigrant agitators. \"We have nothing in common with the racists, and if there are social problems of immigration we don't get into that,\" says John Guillebaud, researcher in reproductive health at University College London, who is co-chair of OPT. \"Genuine asylum seekers and others reasonably admitted can be black, khaki, purple or green, as long as we bring immigration and emigration into balance and control teenage pregnancies over five to six generations. Given the below-replacement average family size chosen by women in this country, that could bring the UK to 30 million by 2130.\" </p> <p>He agrees that restricting immigration could worsen Britain's already problematic age structure, and \"we may give up economic advantage in excluding potential workers who are promising, or willing to do jobs we ourselves don't want to do - but here the end would justify the means: we have to think of the bigger picture. Increasing the population of a seriously overcrowded country is just crazy.\" </p> <p>Rosamund McDougal, a family planning expert and a co-chair of OPT, argues that the race issue is \"simply irrelevant\". </p> <p>\"I'd rather have 40 million people in the UK and half of them black than 100 million all white,\" she says. \"We can't affect the death rate - we can't go around shooting people. What we can do is cut down unwanted births and immigration that we cannot sustain.\" </p> <p>At last, she thinks, the message is getting through to government. \"We were unheard of, our emails got no reply, then the penny dropped,\" she says. \"Defra [the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] used to be hostile, but now wants our input on rural scenarios; we argue that the notion of farmers as paid keepers of the landscape is nonsense because we're going to need the land for energy.\" </p> <p>Best of all, a letter arrived from the Treasury promising that the current review of the sustainable development strategy will \"consider what the challenges are, including in relation to trends in population and lifestyles\". </p> <p>Has the penny dropped?</p>",
  "<p><strong> Warming to the theme </strong> <br>Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, last month dipped his toe into the great environmnent debate with a speech widely deciphered as being about global warming. Now he's moving on to tackle capitalism, ecology, health and all the world's moral problems, in a series of talks at St Paul's Cathedral. The one on environment will be with Ricardo Navarro, director of Friends of the Earth International, and philosopher and Gaia enthusiast Mary Midgley on September 21, 6.30-8pm.</p> <p><strong> No change there, then </strong> <br>Even the business leaders meeting at a sustainability forum, organised by Swiss Re in Zurich last week, were gobsmacked to hear Antony Burgmans, chairman of Unilever Holland, the food and cosmetics giant, claim that the company made no contribution whatever to climate change. For your info, Mr Burgmans, your company uses very large quantities of energy in food processing and in shipping commodities and products around the world.</p> <p><strong> Sour milk </strong> <br>Also there in Zurich was top Nestl\u00e9 man Hans J\u00f6hr, who showed a slide of turban-wearing Pakistani farmers who provide the company with milk, and then rashly quipped that people shouldn't worry because \"this is not an al-Qaida meeting\". That's bad enough, but the fact that many other corporate leaders laughed was worse still. J\u00f6hr concluded by explaining how the most serious repercussion of world poverty was that people didn't have enough money to buy Nescaf\u00e9.</p> <p><strong> Poplar demand </strong> <br>During the industrial revolution, and right through to the 1930s, Manchester found that one tree in particular could withstand the pollution - and thousands of rare Manchester poplars were planted to improve the environment. But Red Rose Forest, a community forests group now planting 25m trees in the area to help clear up the legacy of industrialism, is alarmed. It reports that a rare scab, never seen in this form before in England, is wiping out some of the area's oldest and largest trees. Anyone concerned about a local poplar tree should contact Red Rose Forest on 0161 872 1660.</p> <p><strong> Smoke screen </strong> <br>Just in case you thought Manchester was now clean and green, a report by Calor shows that air pollution from oxides of nitrogen in the city centre are as bad for people as smoking 22 cigarettes a day. Still, that is almost a third less than the average in central London, and half that of the pollution in the centres of Bath and Glasgow.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The real deal</strong><br> So Nick Cater doesn't enjoy watching some of our most popular television programmes such as I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! (Think tank, August 25). Everyone is entitled to their own tastes, but don't let his personal rant against the genre cloud the facts when it comes to reality television and charities. </p> <p>He claims that shows such as I'm A Celebrity ... have raised \"a few pennies\" for charity. In fact, this programme alone has raised more than \u00a33m. He also claims that most charities that receive donations from such shows receive less than a six-figure sum. In the case of the most recent series of I'm A Celebrity ... the opposite is true - the majority of the charities received six figures. </p> <p>His claim that the relationship between charities and television companies is \"fraught\", is not borne out by the large number of letters sent by charities to Granada expressing delight at being involved with the programme. We have not received any complaints. </p> <p>And he fails to supply a single example of how or when a charity has been \"damaged\" by association with a reality programme </p> <p>We don't have to divert money to charity. We choose to. I'm delighted that the huge success of our programme enables us to do so in such a substantial manner. <br><strong>Alexander Gardiner</strong><br>Executive producer, I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! </p> <p><strong> Make the difference</strong><br> When Eric Allison he says that people who are ill should not be in jail (Opinion, August 18), he needs to understand the distinction between people who suffer with mild depression and anxiety and those with severe mental illness. </p> <p>I work in a community mental health team, and I believe that most people would become depressed and anxious if they found themselves in prison. However, there is a distinction between someone who is psychotic and has committed a crime due to the illness (that is, voices telling them to hurt someone) and someone whose mental health problem is not related to their offence. </p> <p>In the first case, the likelihood is that the person may be placed in a psychiatric unit, either informally or on section, immediately after the the offence is committed. The second group of people need to be dealt with by the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Every prison I know of has a psychiatric or vulnerable adults wing. If someone has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and uses hard drugs, and commits an offences for their drug habit. but their mental health problem is not related to the crime, they are treated in the same way as the offender without the mental health problem. However, once in the system, appropriate support is provided. It may not be the ideal environment, but where else does Allison expect people to go?<br><strong>Dan Sumpton</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> Winners and losers</strong><br> Jonathan Myerson (Lambeth talk, August 25) reminded me of my first week as a councillor back in the 1970s. Two elderly ladies living next door to each other both asked me to help them get a bungalow. I took their details; one got a bungalow, the other did not. The lady who was successful thought the world of me, but could not vote for me as the bungalow was in another ward. The other thought I had let her down and never voted for me again. </p> <p>The same week, a mother whose garden ran down to the canal complained that there was no fencing. The town clerk told me he had been badgering British Waterways for years and had at last received a promise that it would be fixed the following week. It was, and the mother was delighted. She told me she had not voted for me, but would next time. You win one, you lose two. <br><strong>John Lodge</strong><br>Lancaster </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Myerson's eagerness to keep his slender majority is leading him down dubious byways. Helping people who are obviously trying to put one over on the council won't win either their respect or their votes. The complainant who seemed to have a valid case - the man with the van (for business?) and a car, but with only one on the road - was refused help. </p> <p>Why? As I recall, the Clapham parking zone was about kicking out selfish commuters who travelled by car to use our tube station and prevented people living and working in the borough from finding legal parking during the day. It was not supposed to be a per-vehicle car tax.<br><strong>Deirdre Mason</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> Unconditional care</strong><br> Having experienced the pain and stress of a major operation - open heart surgery for coronary arteriosclerosis - I believe that George Best, and those like him who are unable to abandon habits such as drinking and smoking, deserve sympathy rather than condemnation, and certainly should not be denied care by the NHS (Force for good, August 25). </p> <p>I have no personal interest at stake, being a non-smoker and having led a physically active life, which is now happily resumed. <br><strong>Dr Bob Heys</strong><br>Halifax </p> <p><strong> For the record</strong><br> We would like to correct any misconception that the Blackburn Asian women's reading group (Novel approach, August 25) is a self-help group. The primary care trust did set up self-help groups, but the group mentioned is primarily for reading.
