  "<p>The Shetland islands may not have much of road network, but they have become the test centre for a car hailed as the future of motoring. </p> <p>Its designers say the hydrogen-powered car, whose only emission is water and which is said to be capable of circling the globe using less power than your average lightbulb, heralds a new age of clean, quiet motoring. In 15-20 years, hydrogen powered vehicles could be commonplace on the roads, they say. </p> <p>But only the diminutive will be able to drive the dolphin-shaped BOC Gh2ost at present - at 40kg, it weighs less than the interior fittings of a standard family saloon. </p> <p>The car is expected to need the equivalent of just two gallons of petrol to navigate the globe using 25 watts of power. </p> <p>This week it will travel to the mainland in an attempt to break the world fuel efficiency record, which stands at 10,705 miles per gallon, during the Shell Eco Marathon in Aberdeenshire. </p> <p>\"It sounds unbelievable how little power is used to keep the BOC Gh2ost moving,\" said John Carolin, global director for the gas giant BOC's hydrogen energy division. \"It demonstrates the impact of careful design. </p> <p>\"Hydrogen power could create a pollution and noise-free environment and bring vital transport solutions to people in poorer parts of the world. Petrol vehicle emissions are a major contributor to rising levels of greenhouse gases and the depletion of fossil fuels. Hydrogen is odourless and tasteless and is the most abundant element in the universe.\" </p> <p>The car's fuel-cell technology has been supplied by the Aberdeen-based firm siGEN, and its sea-mammal form, designed by a racing car expert is constructed of carbon fibre and lightweight aluminium. It has been assembled and road-tested in the Shetland isles. </p> <p>Experts say that to stand a chance of cracking the fuel-efficiency record, the car has to be as light as possible. </p> <p>\"The total weight of this car will be under 40kg,\" said Dave McGrath of siGEN. \"It will be lighter that the front seats of an average family car.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Newspapers: </strong> I tend not to read newspapers any more. I have four children under the age of four, so time is never on my side. I've become sensitive since having children and find a lot of news hard to read. I read the Sun online - it keeps me abreast of pop culture back in England. </p> <p> <strong> Magazines: </strong> I'm passionate about homes and gardens. I get Architectural Digest and the British Homes &amp; Gardens. I buy fashion mags, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. My secret shame is my love of gossip mags. I get US Weekly and People. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> At the moment, I'm reading The Time Traveller's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger. It's quite confusing, but unbelievably inventive. Also, Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls by Rachel Simmons. My daughter is nearly three and she is more trouble than all three boys put together. I'm waiting to reach a point where it tells you how to deal with it. </p> <p> <strong> TV: </strong> When I was pregnant with my twins I was put on drugs that left me incredibly jumpy and unable to focus on anything. I couldn't read or work, and spent my time flicking between channels. I overdosed and haven't watched anything since. </p> <p> <strong> Radio: </strong> I regress to a 16-year-old in the car and listen to C100, which is a bit like Kiss FM. It plays chart rubbish and keeps me feeling young. </p> <p> <strong> Ads: </strong> The only time I see an ad is when we go to the cinema and it makes me really miss Britain - British ads have a wit that Americans don't quite have. </p> <p> <strong> New media: </strong> I'm the eBay queen: I have rarely lost an auction. I've been known to get up at 3am to make sure I win. I'm unable to write at home because I end up spending most of my time on the internet. We have an orchard and I'm currently researching miniature lambs, which were bred for maintaining orchards. They look like little teddy bears.

  "<p>Do you dream of the day you're the boss, able to unwind on the golf course while your subordinates keep your organisation ticking over efficiently in your absence? Well, think again. Britain's hard-pressed managers are finding less and less time to enjoy their annual leave, with almost half unable to take their full complement of holidays. </p> <p>A survey by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) has discovered that, of more than 3,000 managers surveyed, only 53% found time to use their entitlement, down from 66% last year. Most managers cite the main causes as deadline pressures and an inability to delegate tasks. To make matters worse, modern communications mean that managers are increasingly unable to \"get away from it all\" - they are anchored to a virtual desk by an umbilical cord of emails, mobile phones, laptops and PDAs. </p> <p>Professor Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University Management School, is not surprised by the findings. \"Jobs are less secure these days,\" he says. \"As a result, managers feel insecure. They want to show commitment and so stay in the office so as to appear indispensable.\" </p> <p>Roy Hodges, an IT manager from Ipswich, found himself falling into a habit of not taking holidays three years ago. \"Then, I probably had three days left at the end of the year, but things were hectic in December and I just couldn't find the time,\" he says. But it was even worse last year. By September, I'd taken only five of my allotted 25 days. I couldn't see where I'd find the time for the other 20 days before the end of the year. In the event, I squeezed in only another five, and I was on my mobile or laptop for a few of those.\" </p> <p>Such behaviour has repercussions for both employee and employer. Regular breaks are essential for the well-being and effective performance of workers, and the natural consequences of long hours without a break are illness and stress. Liz Tucker, a wellbeing consultant for Champneys Health Resorts, says that an opportunity to relax is vital. \"Some working people even find holidays stressful as they have to work so hard to clear the decks before and have a backlog to deal with afterwards. But a change of environment, an ability to switch off, is a must for good health.\" </p> <p>Advertising agency manager Melissa Frew found this out after being unable to book more than three consecutive days off in more than two years. She eventually suffered periods of stress and, when enforced leave failed to work, she resigned from her job altogether. \"I just became obsessed by the fact that other people couldn't do my job, or if they could, they'd do it badly or inefficiently,\" she says. \"Of course, it wasn't true. They replaced me within weeks of my resignation, so I've spent the last couple of years working like a dog for nothing. But I've had to break away totally to recognise that.\" </p> <p>This, says Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist and coach at the University of Hull, is a symptom of the \"fear factor\" among modern managers. \"They worry about their own position or of outcomes at work that reflect on their performance, and this fear can lead them to be reluctant to relinquish control, even though they desperately need a break.\" Quite apart from the health concerns, Langcaster-James also cites deterioration of the work-life balance and a possible breakdown in family life as a result. \"Without down-time or a proper opportunity for relaxation,\" she says, \"they may reach a state of burnout and eventually render themselves incapable of work through physical illness or stress-related mental ill health. By not wishing to be absent from work for even short periods, managers are paradoxically increasing their risk of long-term absence which could prove to be devastating to the manager, their family and the organisation.\" </p> <p>Roy Hodges listened to similar advice from his GP. \"I felt stressed and anxious all the time,\" he remembers. \"The doctor took one look at me after I finally grabbed five minutes in the evening to see him and convinced me that I needed to look after myself and if I wanted to still matter at work, to take a step back and unwind. I'd lost weight, my diet was appalling, and my sleep patterns were awry.\" </p> <p>According to Professor Cooper, many managers are victims of poor time management. He suggests an organised plan to alleviate the constant flow of work. \"Every day managers need to come into work, look at their in-tray and prioritise. They have to be able to ask: what needs to be done today and what can be left till tomorrow? Managers should take advantage of new technology in every way possible and get someone to run off emails on to hard copy, read them, sort them into piles and prioritise. Don't do them as they come in, pick a time in the day to concentrate solely on emails. And if you have a lot of meetings, ask yourself - do you really need that meeting or could things be sorted without one? The answer is often 'yes'.\"</p> <p>But, ultimately, it is down to individuals to cut themselves some slack and recognise where delegation is possible and when non-priorities can be left for another time. The old favourite needs re-jigging - you shouldn't have to go mad to work here. It doesn't help.</p>",
  "Bruce George, the Labour MP and outgoing president of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly, addressed its annual session in Edinburgh last month. Terrorism, inevitably, was on his mind. \"The cold war was dangerous because one bomb could have finished off Scotland,\" he said, \"but it was an unrealistic threat because both sides were intimidated by each other into not using those weapons. You could rely on the Americans and Soviets being rational, but you cannot rely on these super terrorists negotiating or having any legitimate values. Their aim is to control the world, and that is not a negotiating position.\" <p>He seemed to be claiming that all those postwar nuclear nightmares were misplaced, and such trifles as the Cuban missile crisis and President Reagan's imagined limited nuclear war in Europe had probably been nothing to worry about - but now that al-Qaida was here, we had genuine reason to be scared out of our wits. One could even discern a backhanded glee: at last, proper enemies.</p> <p>If George was attempting to differentiate between the nuclear fears of yore and alarm about al-Qaida, his words served to imply a strange kind of continuity. \"Their aim is to control the world\" - in the minds of the more hot-headed cold warriors, wasn't that exactly what the Soviets were plotting? The speech was another example of this summer's most fashionable manoeuvre: the rolling-out of age-old archetypes by cold war nostalgists who are convinced that a life without fear of imminent apocalypse is no life at all.</p> <p>Once we marvelled at Protect and Survive; now, the postman delivers Preparing for Emergencies, an instruction manual with much the same emphasis on tinned food, quick thinking and proximity to a radio. Lest anyone be unsure of the kind of \"emergency\" the authorities have in mind, this autumn the BBC will screen Dirty War, a drama focused on a terrorist assault in London using \"a crude conventional bomb packed with radioactive waste\".</p> <p>Nearly 20 years have passed since the screening of Threads, the BBC production in which missiles rained down on the UK and the country began a descent into social breakdown, starvation and disease. Now the generation lucky enough to grow up free from apocalyptic dread have their own fear-stoking equivalent. </p> <p>During the cold war, fear was largely manifested passively: aside from bulk buys of beans and CND membership, there wasn't much you could do to avoid the possible launch of Russian missiles. However, this new alleged threat leaves room for the kind of precautionary action that soon turns futile. Trains seem safer than planes, until Madrid's commuter lines become a target. You quit using the tube, only to hear about a plot to attack London buses. Often, the government seems no less confused.</p> <p>And that's the nature of this soup of amorphous, conjectural anxiety. Who exactly are we fretting about? \"Individuals and groups, whether British nationals or not,\" reckons Mr Blunkett. What do they want? Sweeping political change in the Middle East, say some; nothing less than global dominion, claim others. And the means of dealing with them? According to a recent speech given to a Police Federation conference, it's all a matter of \"policing the unknown\". Pardon?</p> <p>If all that suggests a comical kind of bafflement, our more illiberal politicians have been gifted with a context even more empowering than the one provided by communist missiles. If we've no idea of the exact nature of the supposed threats - to London's airports one week, a Manchester United game the next; ricin today, a shoulder-launched rocket tomorrow - then the suggested panaceas will not only extend into the distance, but also stand a good chance of being meekly accepted. As US congressman Jim McDermott says in Fahrenheit 9/11: \"You can make people do anything if they're afraid.\"</p> <p>Voices at the centre confidently advocate a future of identity cards, endless surveillance and obligatory assimilation. The shadowy cadres on the fringes, meanwhile, gleefully make the most of multiculturalism creaking under the weight of it all.</p> <p>The strange thing is, the UK has lived with an ongoing terrorist menace before: a drilled, passionate army of gunmen and explosives experts with a talent for carnage and destabilisation. For almost two decades, however, disquiet about the IRA failed to turn apocalyptic: along with the old-fashioned British talent for getting on with one's life, the distractions of the cold war presumably had a lot to do with it.</p> <p>Still, as Mr George says, they were mere terrorists; our new adversaries are super terrorists. But what to do about them? \"The dilemma for the government,\" he concluded in Edinburgh, \"is to take the issue seriously without being excessively alarmist. If they go too far, they will create paranoia... but people have to know what the threat is. And it is high.\"</p> <p>It amounts to what might be termed the Crimewatch option. Be scared, by all means. But please - don't have nightmares.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Harris is author of The Last Party: Britpop, Blair and the Demise of English Rock</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:johnrhysharris@hotmail.com\">johnrhysharris@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "It's easy to laugh at the idea pioneered by Hazel Blears, the Home Office minister, to run Alpha-style courses for Labour party members to restore their idealism. Easy to scorn the idea of set texts, including key speeches by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, being studied by the party faithful ahead of the weekend workshops. Blears claims it has worked wonders for the members who have already attended the first two and she wants the programme rolled out across the country. <p>Before the cynics pour withering contempt on the whole idea, Blears deserves some credit. First, she has recognised the gravity of a problem which is crippling the party - a crisis of purpose. Second, she's recognised that idealism is not an optional extra in political life, but an essential ingredient of progressive thinking - a truth on which no less a person than Tony Blair has built his entire political career. </p> <p>Finally, she deserves some recognition for her bravery in treading into tricky territory; the debate on Blair's 10-year record between idealists and pragmatists on the left has become vicious. While the former fling their stock accusation at the latter of having sold out, the latter accuse the former of self-indulgence. In this furious argument on the Blair record - which one can already see in the A-level history papers of the 2020s - a million fewer children living in poverty is stacked against the escalating crisis in Iraq. A handsomely increased aid budget is up against the sham of half-truths which sold us a war on false pretences. What kind of qualification in moral accountancy could arbitrate this debate? Most, foxed and furious, shrug their shoulders, baffled by the paradoxes and inconsistencies. </p> <p>I have little patience with those pragmatists who demand we \"get real\". We are entitled to judge New Labour and Blair on moral and idealistic grounds - because it is precisely on those grounds that they have consistently sold themselves to the British electorate. </p> <p>Take three junctures in Blair's leadership when that has been evident. First, in his 1995 party conference speech, he declared that \"socialism... is a moral purpose to life, a set of values, a belief in society, in cooperation... it is how I try to live my life... I am worth no more than any other man... This is my socialism.\" And he concluded: \"Let us rouse ourselves to a new moral purpose for our nation... the coming election is not a struggle for political power, it is a battle for the soul of a nation.\"</p> <p>In 1999, in a speech in Chicago in the midst of the Kosovo war, he extended this interpretation of socialism to global community and set five tests for intervention in another country (the war in Iraq didn't meet any of them). In 2001, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, he famously declared that \"the starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, those living in want and squalor from the deserts of north Africa to the slums of Gaza, to the mountain ranges of Afghanistan: they too are our cause. This is a moment to seize... the pieces are in flux, soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us reorder the world around us.\" </p> <p>Today, there's no evidence left in Blair of that early 1995 humility. The man who can lounge at the side of Silvio Berlusconi's swimming pool seems to be tone-deaf to the moral implications of his private life; it is a choice of holiday which infuriates precisely because it seems such a wanton squandering of a resource in which Blair is in short supply - his moral credibility. (An issue not helped by his wife signing on for fat fees for a public-speaking tour in the US - the size of the fees a consequence of her relationship to Blair rather than to her professional status.) </p> <p>There is a painful irony that the most overtly idealistic politics for a generation should have led us into the most acute of moral quagmires in Iraq, one which will dog British politics for at least the next decade. Blair cast himself as the cheerleader of the biggest act of unprovoked US aggression for decades - and every day the promised benefits of this illegal action become more illusory as daily life becomes more dangerous, and necessities such as water, electricity, healthcare and education become increasingly precarious. </p> <p>The \"reordering of the world\" which Blair announced in 2001 is now all too real in the nightmare of new levels of tension and fury throughout the Middle East as events in Najaf unfold. The war in Iraq and the means by which he got his country into it - without the UN, without international consensus, and with the manipulation of intelligence - has morally bankrupted Blair. </p> <p>Maybe the morality of all political parties gets tattered after a certain period in office, but the order of Blair's moral betrayal has gone well beyond that. No British political leader has pitched so high - and fallen so far short. </p> <p>With the benefit of hindsight, the compelling attractions of Blair's morality, compared to the amorality of the Tories, blinded us. We asked the wrong questions of the young leader in waiting; the issue was not whether he was sincere. He was. What we underestimated was his remarkable capacity to convince himself of the moral rectitude of his own actions. We also gravely underestimated how much he wanted - and still does - to be a visionary leader. We didn't grasp the fatal element of narcissism which propels such moral ambition and we failed to predict how, in office, that could translate into arrogant hubris. </p> <p>I feel a fool now. Looking back at those early speeches, I remember how arresting they seemed at the time. But now, after nearly a decade, I see that he was using morality to reconcile the irreconcilable - socialism and Thatcherite neo-liberalism. He recast socialism as a morality of community and mutual responsibility which could be wrapped around the accommodation with neo-liberalism; it enabled him to fudge tough questions about inequality. Later, he used morality on the international stage to dress up a government bogged down in managerialism and public-sector reform. </p> <p>The metaphor which comes to mind is morality as a kind of all-purpose Polyfilla which Blair has used to great effect to build the coalitions, and mask the internal contradictions of policies on both the domestic and international front. For a while, it looked good, but no longer. A morally bankrupted Blair can't resort to the language of crusades. The cracks are reappearing; without a common sense of moral purpose, New Labour will fracture into its constituent, warring factions. Blears's proposal may be timely and necessary - it's just that it is hopeless. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Hurricane Charley may not be the most terrible storm to have hit the US coastline, but it could be a warning of worse to come. </p> <p>In the course of its brief life, a typical Caribbean hurricane releases the destructive power of 100,000 Hiroshima bombs. Most of this is spent over water. When hurricanes hit land, their energy dissipates very swiftly, but any settlements on the coast are at risk. </p> <p>Experts rate Charley as a category 4 event (the worst is category 5), with winds strong enough to sweep away mobile homes, dismantle roofs and snap mature trees. </p> <p>Climate scientists, relief agencies such as the Red Cross and insurance chiefs have been warning for years that climate-related disasters are on the increase, at least partly because of global warming. </p> <p>In 2003, a total of around 700 natural catastrophes killed more than 50,000 people worldwide and caused economic losses estimated at $60bn (\u00a332bn), according to the insurance giant Munich Re. </p> <p>Windstorms made up only about a third of the disasters, but accounted for three-quarters of all the insured losses. </p> <p>Tornadoes and hailstorms in April and May 2003 cost the US cities and towns of the midwest insured losses of $5bn. </p> <p>In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel swept the US east coast and devastated 360,000 homes, with estimated economic losses of another $5bn. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 cost the US around $30bn, however, and may still be the single most costly disaster ever to hit the US. </p> <p>Climate scientists began warning 20 years ago that global warming could bring a greater frequency of \"extreme\" weather events. Hurricanes follow a 10-year cycle of relative calm and increasing violence. </p> <p>\"Our forecasts warned that this was going to be one of the most active hurricane seasons since 1950,\" said Bill McGuire, who heads the Benfield hazards research centre at University College London. \"We forecast a couple of hurricanes on the US coast. This is one of them and it is likely that we will be waiting for another one before November.\" </p> <p>More than half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, with the most vulnerable concentrations in the tropics. </p> <p>In 1970, a catastrophic storm claimed 300,000 lives in Bangladesh. In 1991, a cyclone in similar conditions swept away 139,000 people from the same region. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch tore through Central America and claimed more than 9,000 lives. More than 1.4 million people had to leave their homes. </p> <p>Warning systems, even in the most poorest and most vulnerable regions, have improved since then, but the economic losses after storms have multiplied through the decades. This is partly because population growth means there are another 70 million potential victims every year.</p>",
  "Why is a 60-year-old millionaire in shirt and slacks touring America, saluting plump matrons with banners and teenagers waving flags? <p>Because he's John Kerry and, almost four decades after four or so months of very active military service, he's running for president. No, wait. Saluting for president. It's an incongruous and depressing spectacle. </p> <p>There is, in a muted way, quite a lot to be said for Kerry. Watch him answering questions from black journalists in Washington last week and see how he handles the issues well: he's good at thoughtful policy discussion. </p> <p>His long years in the Senate haven't been wasted. He understands defence and intelligence. Maybe he still looks curiously lumpen on the stump - half Woody from Toy Story, half Van Heflin in Shane - but his Boston convention speech was decently eloquent. And he gave his daughter's hamster the kiss of life. </p> <p>In sum, Kerry and John Edwards make a balanced team - mixed gravitas and grin - which, nationally, is probably just ahead of Bush and Cheney - mixed gawp and grizzle - and doing rather better than that in a majority of the battleground states where November's election will be won and lost. </p> <p>So far, so promising. But somehow you feel that the real contest isn't joined yet - and meanwhile Kerry keeps on saluting, a nervous tic. </p> <p>We know why he does it. Some bright spark, long ago on the primary campaign trail, decided that Kerry's brief, old moment of heroism in a war Americans in general (and Democrats in particular) like to forget, could be vamped point-counterpoint against George Bush's more mysterious record flying Texan National Guard jets in Alabama. But the point, not to mention the counterpoint, is pretty exhausted now. </p> <p>It isn't just the predictable emergence of a bunch of well-funded Vietnam veterans who buy TV commercial time to defecate on his record (even if, as it seems, they weren't exactly on the spot when the waste matter hit the fan). </p> <p>It is the way the whole nature of the debate is cramped and confined by its pseudo-military posturing. In theory, Kerry's little C-in-C routine makes him a natural White House adversary of Osama, Saddam and menacing visitors from outer space. (Alien versus Predator is on general US release this week.) In practice, it makes him as one-dimensional as an empty parade ground. </p> <p>His ramrod back and carving fingers say he should be barking orders. But, when his lips move, they mouth careful clauses and prudent caveats. </p> <p>He's uneasy playing simple in a complex world - and, properly orchestrated, that could be a real strength. Who needs another candidate flubbing his script and playing stupid? But when mouth and military two-step don't match, the result is painfully obvious. \"Flip-flop!\" cry George W and the rest. He engages brain and changes his mind! Who on earth can salute such indecision? </p> <p>Some of the Bush charges are asinine. The president calls Kerry a slacker, for instance - probably in yet another ex cathedra vacation statement from Midland, Texas. But flip-floppery is a more resonant slur. </p> <p>Anyone who sits in the Senate has his party line to worry about - and inconsistency comes as inevitably as politics. A politician with a long record has to be vulnerable to easy hits, and can perhaps explain and defuse them. But a war hero with a saluting twitch sets himself up as something different, something above politics. </p> <p>Kerry is stuck now with a hollow, unhelpful role - mired in ancient controversy, doomed to renounce nuances or balances. </p> <p>Would he (the Michael Howard memorial gaffe) have gone to war in Iraq knowing that it (like the duff intelligence it was based on) clearly wasn't worth it. An answer that both Bush and Blair might privately echo. </p> <p>But Kerry can't do hypotheticals or hindsight. He has to be straight and clear. So, yes, he would have moved to oust Saddam. He'd have done, alas, just what the president did. </p> <p>And thus the me-too litany grows. Is America really embarked on a \"war\" against terror - as opposed to the pursuit of a particularly malign agglomeration of terrorists? It's a vital distinction, but Commander Kerry can't make it. D</p> <p>on't we hear rather too much about service nobility and rather too little about Abu Ghraib? Kerry, the super vet, is hamstrung there, too. Come to think of it, where is Osama bin Laden - or even Mullah Omar? The commander can't go there either. He'd be talking military failure, not military triumph. </p> <p>He could make hay with the Bush record day after day. Flip-flop? First flatten Najaf, then pick it up and dust it down. He could ridicule the Bush absurdity of bringing \"democracy and freedom\" to the Muslim world which doesn't appear to include Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>He could laugh out loud when Bush calls Afghanistan a \"rising democracy\" - as opposed to the rising star of global heroin production. </p> <p>But, yet again, he's hobbled. He wants the troops home early. He's on their side against the White House and an indeterminate schedule which sees the boys sweating it out in Baghdad for ever. </p> <p>To achieve his early exit, though, he needs more help from more allies - which means he can't be nasty to anyone. A democratic \"coalition of the willing\" which includes Turkmenistan is a joke beyond sickness. A \"new mood of cooperation\" means finally proving less feeble, less flip-floppy than Bush has proved over Israel. It means telling General Sharon where he gets off and what to with his wall. </p> <p>A statesman could begin to lay out that ground. An ordinary, articulate politician could begin to explain why change is necessary. </p> <p>Kerry direly needs such change. It is why he is necessary. But not while he's giving that damned salute, not while the Mekong still flows straight through the purple heart of his campaign. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Four Japanese cabinet ministers sparked outrage yesterday when they visited a controversial shrine to mark the 59th anniversary of the end of the second world war. <p>Nearly 2.5 million war dead, including executed war criminals, are worshiped, as deities at Yasukuni Shrine, which was visited by the trade, agriculture, public safety and environment ministers. </p> <p>In Beijing a foreign ministry spokesman, expressed regret over the visit while in Hong Kong small groups of protesters marched on the Japanese consulate, denouncing Japan's wartime atrocities. </p> <p>In Tokyo the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, observed a moment's silence and laid flowers at a cemetery for the unknown war dead near the Imperial Palace. He also promised a crowd gathered to honour those who lost their lives in the war that Japan would advance peace.</p>",
  "Insurgents yesterday launched a concerted effort to disrupt an historic national conference in Baghdad when they lobbed mortars at the venue where the assembly was being held, killing two people. <p>Soon after delegates from around the country had begun debating, an explosion ripped into a taxi and bus stand a few hundred metres away. At least 17 people were injured. </p> <p>The blast rattled windows at the venue for the three-day conference, a key step towards democracy and elections, but no one inside was hurt. </p> <p>Opening the conference inside Baghdad's heavily fortified \"green zone\", Iraq's prime minister, Ayad Allawi, told some 1,300 delegates that the country needed to push on in its efforts to create democracy after decades of brutal rule under Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>\"Your presence here today is the biggest challenge to the forces of darkness that want to tear this country apart,\" he said. \"This is not the end of the road, it is the first step on the way to democracy.\" </p> <p>The political and religious leaders gathered for the meeting will choose a 100-member assembly, or national council, to oversee the interim government until elections are held, theoretically in January. </p> <p>But the prime minister's comments were undermined by new fighting in the holy city of Najaf, and confusion over how his interim government intends to resolve its 10-day standoff with the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>Explosions and gunfire rattled through the centre of Najaf again yesterday as US troops in armoured vehicles and tanks returned to the streets. Dozens of explosions from tanks shells and mortars reverberated across the city's vast cemetery, where fighters from Mr Sadr's Mahdi army have been hiding. </p> <p>An American tank shell landed near the outer wall of the Imam Ali shrine, where the Mahdi militia has its base, killing one fighter, according to witnesses. \"The shrine was not hit,\" Ahmed al-Shaibany, an aide to Mr Sadr added. </p> <p>Last night Iraqi police ordered all journalists to leave Najaf. Four police cars surrounded a hotel where journalists were staying and presented the order, signed by Najaf's police chief, Brigadier Ghalib al-Jazaari, the Associated Press news agency reported. Police said reporters who remained would be arrested, journalists said. </p> <p>The renewed violence in Najaf followed the apparent collapse of talks to end the crisis. On Saturday Iraq's national security adviser, Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie, said he had given up trying to negotiate a deal with Mr Sadr, who has demanded that the US withdraw from the city and free his captured fighters. </p> <p>\"After three days, my government thought there was no use in continuing,\" Mr Rubaie said. Mr Sadr's aides claim a deal was agreed, but fell through after Mr Allawi torpedoed it. </p> <p>The fighting in Najaf during the past 10 days has spread to seven other Shia cities in southern and central Iraq, and has severely dented Mr Allawi's credibility, in what has been his first big test since taking office at the end of June. </p> <p>Mr Sadr and a leading Sunni religious organisation, the Muslim Clerics' Association, both decided to boycott yesterday's conference in Baghdad, claiming that it lacked legitimacy. </p> <p>\"They call it a national conference, although it is not,\" Mr Sadr told the Arabic television network al-Jazeera. </p> <p>The conference was due to open in late July, but was delayed after the United Nations demanded more time for preparations. Some delegates have accused the government of stacking the slate with Allawi supporters. </p> <p>\"The political parties in power now have the overwhelming majority of delegates. They left no room for independents,\" Muhammad Bahr al-Uloum, a leading Shia cleric and a former president of the now defunct Iraqi governing council, said. </p> <p>Another delegate, Nadim al-Jadari, of the Shia Political Council, yesterday ran on to the platform and threatened to quit the conference unless talks were resumed to end the Najaf fighting. </p> <p>Lieutenant Yasser Fawaz of the Iraq police said yesterday's mortar attack had been intended to hit the high-security green zone. </p> <p>Instead, it crashed into the bus station by mistake, he said. Two mini-vans that took the force of the blast were perforated with shrapnel. A large pool of blood lay nearby. Police officers took away the dead and injured in pick-up trucks. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the capital there was more violence yesterday as insurgents killed an American soldier in a roadside bomb blast. South of Baghdad, a Ukrainian soldier died in a mine blast, while a Dutch soldier was killed and five others wounded late on Saturday in an attack in southern Iraq.</p>",
  "The numbers of sufferers of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease, have soared across the West in less than 20 years, scientists have discovered. <p>The alarming rise, which includes figures showing rates of dementia have trebled in men, has been linked to rises in levels of pesticides, industrial effluents, domestic waste, car exhausts and other pollutants, says a report in the journal Public Health.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, there were around 3,000 deaths a year from these conditions in England and Wales. By the late 1990s, there were 10,000. </p> <p>'This has really scared me,' said Professor Colin Pritchard of Bournemouth University, one of the report's authors. 'These are nasty diseases: people are getting more of them and they are starting earlier. We have to look at the environment and ask ourselves what we are doing.' </p> <p>The report, which Pritchard wrote with colleagues at Southampton University, covered the incidence of brain diseases in the UK, US, Japan, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain in 1979-1997. The researchers then compared death rates for the first three years of the study period with the last three, and discovered that dementias - mainly Alzheimer's, but including other forms of senility - more than trebled for men and rose nearly 90 per cent among women in England and Wales. All the other countries were also affected. </p> <p>For other ailments, such as Parkinson's and motor neurone disease, the group found there had been a rise of about 50 per cent in cases for both men and women in every country except Japan. The increases in neurological deaths mirror rises in cancer rates in the West. </p> <p>The team stresses that its figures take account of the fact that people are living longer and it has also made allowances for the fact that diagnoses of such ailments have improved. It is comparing death rates, not numbers of cases, it says. </p> <p>As to the cause of this disturbing rise, Pritchard said genetic causes could be ruled out because any changes to DNA would take hundreds of years to take effect. 'It must be the environment,' he said. </p> <p>The causes were most likely to be chemicals, from car pollution to pesticides on crops and industrial chemicals used in almost every aspect of modern life, from processed food to packaging, from electrical goods to sofa covers, Pritchard said. </p> <p>Food is also a major concern because it provides the most obvious explanation for the exclusion of Japan from many of these trends. Only when Japanese people move to the other countries do their disease rates increase. </p> <p>'There's no one single cause ... and most of the time we have no studies on all the multiple interactions of the combinations on the environment. I can only say there have been these major changes [in deaths]: it is suggested it's multiple pollution.' </p> <p>Pritchard's paper has been published amid growing fears about the chemical build-up in the environment. A number of studies have pointed to serious problems. TBT is being banned from marine paints after it was blamed for masculinising female molluscs, causing a dramatic decline in numbers. A US report linked neurological disorders to pesticides. And testing by WWF (formerly the World Wildlife Fund) found non-natural substances such as flame retardants in every person who took part. </p> <p>WWF has named chemical pollution as one of the two great environmental threats to the world, alongside global warming, and is particularly worried about 'persistent and accumulative' industrial chemicals and endocrine - hormone distorting - substances linked to changes in gender and behaviour among animals and even children. </p> <p>'We've started seeing changes in fertility rates, the immune system, neurological changes [and] impacts on behaviour,' said Matthew Wilkinson, the charity's toxics programme leader. </p> <p>Pesticides and pharmaceutical chemicals must now undergo rigorous testing before they can be used. But there are an estimated 80,000 industrial chemicals and the 'vast majority' do not need safety regulation or testing, said Wilkinson. </p> <p>However, the chemical industry strongly rejects what it claims are often unproven fears. Just because chemicals are present does not mean they are at dangerous levels. </p> <p>But critics are not reassured. 'It is true that just because we find a chemical does not mean it is dangerous,' said Wilkinson. 'But it is equally true that for the vast majority of chemicals we have so little safety data that the regulatory authorities have no idea what a safe level is.' </p> <p>The Royal Society of Chemistry also said quantities of pesticides were declining. 'Improvements in analytical chemistry mean that lower and lower levels of pesticides can be detected,' said Brian Emsley, the society's spokesman. '[But] because you can detect something doesn't necessarily mean it is dangerous.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B73H6-49MX361-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_handle=B-WA-A-A-AE-MsSAYZW-UUW-AUECVACBWA-AUEWEEZAWA-CDCDBVBAV-AE-U&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2004&amp;_rdoc=7&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%2311546%232004%23998819995%23499826!&amp;_cdi=11546&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1e4e0a14e612473adb81ed1ed9a04e4a\">Read the original report in Public Health</a></p>",
  "<p>American author Bill Bryson once remarked with awe on the ability of 'Britons of all ages and social backgrounds to get genuinely excited by the prospect of a hot beverage'. It was ever thus. The first coffee house opened in London in 1652. Historically speaking, we were a sitting duck for branded coffee culture.</p> <p>Contemporary coffee houses, with squishy sofas and baristas fixing mochas, rule the high street. Starbucks is king, followed by Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Coffee Republic, in that order. If you don't have one, it's probably coming soon as coffee chains expand out of major cities. Who knows? This time next year, your local post office may have swapped stamps for frappuccinos. By 2005 the UK coffee industry is predicted to be worth \u00a31 billion.</p> <p>But while we buy seven million coffees a week 'to go', it's estimated that a Guatemalan coffee picker would have to put in five days' work to afford just half a kilo of Starbucks coffee. There is a huge discrepancy between the humble coffee bean and the frothy concoctions that propel us into the office.</p> <p>From Guatemala to Uganda, coffee, once viewed as the ultimate cash crop and route out of poverty, routinely costs more to produce than it sells for. Overproduction and a multinational monopoly have lead to a 30-year low in prices. By 2002 the global price had dropped by 50 per cent. Nestle, Sara Lee, Kraft and Proctor &amp; Gamble buy half the world's beans for the instant market and detractors say they have the economic fate of countries in their hands. Growers struggle to buy food, send their children to school and keep a roof over their heads. The collapse of coffee prices is, according to Oxfam, 'a disaster whose impact will be felt for a long time'. </p> <p>That's not to mention the environmental fall-out. Intensive coffee production leads to a loss of biodiversity as previously biologically rich rainforest becomes a 'green desert', ruined by irrigation and agro-chemicals.</p> <p>Switching your tipple to certified fair-trade coffee helps ensure that growers are paid a fair price, often selling direct to consumers through cooperatives. Over 80 per cent is also shade grown (ie doesn't lead to deforestation) or organic, which is better for the environment, and for the grower and drinker's health. The paragon of beverages combines all three, and the paragon of drinkers avoids sending a plastic-coated cup to landfill by drinking instore or by using a 'commuter cup' as sold by Starbucks, which saves you 10p each time you use it. Since the mid-Nineties, when Starbucks was charged with sourcing beans from export houses that paid Guatemalan workers less than a living daily wage, campaigners have pushed for more support for fair trade. Although the company has a scheme to pay producers above the market price, in my local Starbucks last week there was still only one bona-fide fair-trade option - a boring filter coffee.</p> <p>I'm pinning my hopes on the first Progreso coffee bars, due to be launched later this year. A joint venue between Oxfam and the UK's largest independent roaster, Matthew Algie, these will give producers a fair price and a direct share in profits. At last, a mocha without a double shot of social and environmental injustice.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 22 2004</strong> </p> <p>In the article below, we said that Oxfam had decided to stop accepting funds from the British government. Oxfam has asked us to make it clear that this is not the case and that it does accept government money.</p> <p></p> <p>The world's biggest international aid agency has warned that tens of millions of the world's poorest people are threatened by an unprecedented wave of freak and extreme weather, and that aid workers may be unable to cope with the global humanitarian crisis that might result. </p> <p>Clouds of locusts, cyclones, massive floods and devastating droughts are wreaking havoc in many of the world's poorest countries, and agencies don't have the resources to cope, said John Powell, deputy executive director of the World Food Programme. </p> <p>Powell said that although agencies are racing to be ready when the disasters strike, there is a serious risk that the world's richest people may be too wrapped up in their immediate problems - from obesity to the threat of terrorism - to provide sufficient aid. He also criticised the post-11 September obsession with security. </p> <p>'Right now, in West Africa, the biggest swarm of locusts the region has seen for more than a decade is devouring crops and threatening to put at least a million people at risk. Countries as far away from each other as Kenya, Cuba and Afghanistan are currently in the grip of serious droughts. Freak weather conditions have brought flooding to Nicaragua. In Peru, mountain villagers have lost livestock and crops after the worst recorded frost and snow storms in almost three decades,' Powell told The Observer in Rome, where the WFP has its headquarters. </p> <p>'Addressing the needs of these millions of people is difficult at the best of times, but in 2004, a cruel convergence of economic factors could pose as much of a threat to their livelihoods as civil wars, natural disasters or the spread of disease,' Powell said. </p> <p>Security concerns, oil prices, the falling dollar and increased food and freight costs have made humanitarian assistance more expensive than ever, Powell said. At the same time, long-term economic and climatic changes mean that the world's poorest are more vulnerable than they were just 20 years ago. </p> <p>The WFP's campaign, to be launched next week, aims to alert world attention to the sheer number of people at risk. </p> <p>'The shocking thing about hunger is that we seem to have grown almost immune to its devastating toll,' Powell said. 'Before we congratulate ourselves on our generosity towards the more than two million who have been forced from their homes by conflict in western Sudan, we should remind ourselves that they represent just a tiny fraction of the world's undernourished.' </p> <p>In a controversial sideswipe at the invasion of Iraq, likely to anger many major WFP donors, Powell criticised the amount 'that has been said about the clear and present danger from weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>'At the WFP we are confronted by a real weapon of mass destruction and it is a weapon that is killing people every day,' he said. 'That weapon is apathy towards the problem of hunger.' </p> <p>The WFP's campaign is backed by a range of other agencies. </p> <p>Leading western-run aid agencies have also told The Observer that 'war on terrorism' has made it almost impossible for agencies to remain neutral and 'get on with their job'. </p> <p>Oxfam is so uncomfortable that it has decided to stop accepting funds from the British government, formerly one of its biggest donors. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, rather than compromise its neutrality, has pulled out of Afghanistan.</p>",
  "Two Greek sporting legends were last night suspended from the Athens Olympics amid suspicion they faked a motorcycle accident to cover up a missed drugs test. <p>Sprinters Kostas Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou were removed temporarily by the Greek Olympic Committee amid growing anger their behaviour had brought scandal to the sporting showpiece. </p> <p>The suspension is set to be extended for the duration of the Games when the International Olympic Committee meets tomorrow to consider their behaviour. Sweden's Olympic team have threatened to pull out if the pair - long suspected of taking performance-enhancing substances - are not excluded. </p> <p>One of the most bizarre sagas in sporting history took another twist when Greek police said they were investigating the alleged crash but could find no evidence or witnesses to suggest it had actually occurred. The pair's coach claimed they had suffered a smash when speeding to the Olympic Village to give drug samples. </p> <p>The affair is a mixture of mystery, confusion, broken rules and high farce. Under IOC regulations, the test the runners missed last Thursday is likely to count as the same as passing a positive sample and could lead to them being banned for two years. </p> <p>It is a calamity for the Olympic hosts, whose efforts in staging a memorable opening ceremony in front of a huge global TV audience have now been overshadowed. </p> <p>Kederis, 31, and Thanou, 29, became national heroes after surprisingly winning the gold medal in the 200m and the silver in the 100m at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Kederis has had roads and even a ship named after him. </p> <p>The circumstances surround ing the two missing their tests, 24 hours before the opening ceremony, are still shrouded in confusion. There is a growing belief that the runners faked the smash to try to divert attention from the fact that they had deliberately avoided giving samples to the drug-testers. </p> <p>Kederis may now retire rather than fight disciplinary proceedings which look inevitable. Until last Thursday, he was Greece's most popular man. Now he, and Thanou, are seen as traitors. </p> <p>Greeks are united in contempt for the pair bringing such shame on their country at an event they hoped would mark its triumphant emergence as a modern European country. 'They should be strung up,' said Litsa Sarantou, a bee keeper. 'No,' added retired bank employee Nassos Kafezopoulos. 'They should be shot.' </p> <p>The Greek media is equally hostile. Kathemerini, a daily broadsheet, yesterday called the saga 'a debacle, a scandal, a fiasco' - which is even more embarrassing given that Greece had promised to thwart such abasement and organise the cleanest Games in modern history'. </p> <p>Both runners missed a previous drugs test, when they told testers they would be in Crete but went to Qatar, and Kederis failed to submit to a test recently in Chicago. </p> <p>The IOC has introduced the toughest drug-testing regime since the Olympics restarted, in Athens, in 1896.</p>",
  "<p>The fact that we have finally been treated to some sunshine is likely to enhance our appetite for salads. Few would doubt that salads offer a good deal from a nutritional perspective. However, where flavour is concerned, I reckon that what turns a good salad into a really great one is the dressing. </p> <p>Unfortunately, conventional wisdom dictates that the oily nature of traditional dressings does not bode well for our waistlines or weight, and such fat-phobia has spawned an ever-expanding number of low-fat and even 'fat-free' dressings. However, as I explained in a previous column, review studies have found that long-term low-fat eating is quite ineffective for the purposes of weight loss. Research has also revealed that fat can actually enhance the nutritional value of the food we eat. </p> <p>Specifically, studies have shown that fat aids and abets our ability to extract and absorb carotenoid nutrients such as betacarotene (found in many green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables) and lycopene (found primarily in tomatoes). The role that fat plays in the extraction of carotenoids from food was most recently assessed in a study published this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. </p> <p>Researchers measured the levels of three carotenoids (betacarotene, alphacarotene and lycopene) before and after the consumption of a mixed salad accompanied by either a fat-free, reduced-fat or full-fat dressing. Researchers found that eating salad with a fat-free dressing did not lead to a significant rise in the levels of any of the carotenoids measured. </p> <p>However, when the salad was eaten with a reduced-fat dressing, there were appreciable rises in the levels of all three nutrients. What is more, the full-fat dressing boosted carotenoid levels significantly higher than the fat-reduced variety. The reason for this is not known for certain, though it has been suggested that fat assists the release of carotenoids from food and eases their passage through the gut wall into the bloodstream. </p> <p>Whatever the precise mechanism, the effect undoubtedly promises significant benefits to our health: carotenoids have been found to offer an array of beneficial biochemical actions for the body, and a mass of evidence now exists which suggests that they have considerable cancer-protective properties. </p> <p>When it comes to choosing an oil for a dressing, I prefer cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fat, which can bring benefits for the heart and circulation. The oil is extracted with minimal processing and with no application of heat - factors that are believed to help preserve its innate healthy properties.</p> <p><strong>Nutrition news</strong><br>Atherosclerosis is the name given to the process in which cholesterol-like substances deposit themselves on the inside of the body's arteries. Atherosclerosis in the vessels supplying blood to the brain (the carotid arteries) increases the risk of problems such as stroke and dementia. In a recent study, researchers assessed the effects of drinking pomegranate juice in a group of people with confirmed carotid atherosclerosis. The pomegranate fruit contains a variety of 'antioxidant' compounds (including phenolic substances, tannins and anthocyanins), one effect of which is to protect cholesterol from oxidation, thereby reducing its tendency to be deposited on the inside of the arteries. Individuals drinking 50mls of pomegranate juice each day enjoyed an average 35 per cent reduction in the extent of their carotid atherosclerosis over the course of a year. </p> <p>In comparison, those not having pomegranate juice (the control group) saw an average increase in the extent of their carotid atherosclerosis of 9 per cent. This study suggests that regular consumption of pomegranate may stimulate important anti-atherosclerotic actions within the body.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals an Opportunity of our Times</strong><br>by Timothy Garton Ash<br>Allen Lane \u00a317.99, pp320</p> <p>Timothy Garton Ash is an optimist. The transatlantic relationship is in crisis, with diplomats and policy wonks on both sides of the Atlantic fearing that the intensive post-Iraq marriage counselling will fail. Robert Kagan, the most articulate of America's neocons, has gone so far as to declare that we live on different planets - Americans from Mars and Europeans from Venus, a beguiling thesis that some have seemed determined to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>Garton Ash doesn't buy it. Well established as Britain's leading thinker on contemporary European affairs (albeit in a sadly under-crowded field), he is able to bring a wider-angled lens to these familiar, entrenched controversies. Here, conversations with both statesman and citizens across Europe and North America see him challenge most of the generalisations that dominate current debate.</p> <p>For Garton Ash, both Europe and America inevitably contradict themselves - because both contain multitudes. Garton Ash wants not just a renewal of vows but a new shared mission. He also wants to see the end of 'the West' but only when the billion of us who live in free societies create a new 'post-West' by spreading security and freedom globally. He thus thinks the current transatlantic rift a rather parochial spat, arguing that Europeans may have only another two decades in which they can hope to play a shaping role in global affairs while the scope and limits of America's military power have also become clearer in postwar Iraq.</p> <p>Still, starting from here will be difficult. The book's critique of the Bush administration is a familiar one, though the author is always at pains to distinguish this from anti-Americanism. Indeed, there is a growing awareness within a highly polarised United States of the self-defeating damage done to America's 'soft power' (the worldwide appeal of the Statue of Liberty and its open and prosperous society and the good life). The mistakes America made following 11 September 2001 wasted much of the global sympathy the attacks had brought it.</p> <p>Yet Garton Ash is no less sceptical about the grandstanding of European statesmen, when the EU's aspirations to an effective foreign policy remain largely rhetorical. He believes that Blair made a major blunder over Iraq but is fundamentally sympathetic to the project of seeking to 'bridge' the Atlantic, arguing that much of the new Europe finds it as impossible as Britain does to choose between loyalty to Europe and America.</p> <p>Garton Ash believes we can find causes for optimism if our responses to the current international crisis draw as much on Europe's '9/11 of hope' (the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989) as America's 9/11. Just as stereotypes and mutual antagonism saw divisions over Iraq deepen, a virtuous spiral could make his free world possible, Garton Ash suggests. A fully committed European Britain could make a Franco-British-German rapprochement possible, creating a more outward-looking Europe.</p> <p>Such a Europe could encourage a better America to believe that effective multilateral institutions are possible, this being the only way that emerging powers such as China might co-operate on global warming and so on. These debates are interdependent but, of course, this seems a rather long-odds accumulator bet.</p> <p>Britain's deep ambivalence about the European Union and its new constitution and the reaction of Jacques Chirac to the new Europe of 25 - suggesting that ex-Iron Curtain countries might best keep quiet in the EU - hardly augur well.</p> <p>Garton Ash does not just make an eloquent appeal to the better America and the better Europe. He also insists, unfashionably, on our ability as citizens to exert pressure for change. Here is where his decades talking to Czechs, Poles and Hungarians are most telling. Sometimes, the citizens' action proposed is direct and tangible: we should pressure governments to meet the much-neglected target to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP and also give 1 per cent of our personal incomes to support development. But how citizens will make their voices count for more in a constructive way, especially when the key decisions are taken in labyrinth of multilateral international institutions, is less clear.</p> <p>Garton Ash's 'free world' project is unfashionably optimistic, too, despite the spread and entrenchment of democracy over the decades from 1945 to 1975 to 1989 and beyond. Europe's liberal left, despite its Enlightenment roots, balks from such language, for fear of being associated with an aggressive neocon project. Yet Europe's left risks becoming a 'status quo' force if it tries to turn an effective critique of the botched Iraq intervention into an essentially conservative argument which accepts the premise of a 'clash of civilisations' and the belief that the Arabs are incapable of democracy.</p> <p>The debate about intervention in failed states has become muddied by Iraq, but it would be a mistake to forget the distance travelled over the 1990s because of the failures to intervene in Rwanda or, for too long, in Bosnia, because these 'ancient ethnic hatreds' were none of our business. Whether over the current genocide in Sudan or elsewhere, these debates will soon return. But we may be considerably further from finding an effective response to them.</p> <p>Garton Ash rightly sees a victory for John Kerry in America's presidential election this November as vital to any fresh start. But a Kerry victory would also re-expose the faultlines of many of the most important and unresolved debates of the past decade. If Europeans could respond to the current crisis in the spirit of this book, it might do something to tilt the balance towards the better America we need. And in asserting the importance of those of us in democratic societies seeking to be authors of our own fate, Garton Ash has produced a humane, democratic manifesto for our times. It is worth recalling the lesson of the fall of the Berlin Wall - politics sometimes needs to be the art of the impossible, too.</p>",
  "They defined suburbia. Closely trimmed front lawns fringed by neatly clipped privet hedges have provided the showcase for Britain's middle-classes to display their horticultural prowess. <p>These precious squares of turf are now under siege, however. Entire streets of Victorian terraced housing and Thirties semis have lost their grass and seasonal blooms. Hundreds of thousands of front gardens lie smothered beneath a tide of asphalt laid to create spaces to park Britain's 32 million cars. </p> <p>Until now the trend has provoked anger on purely aesthetic terms. But government advisers are warning that the disappearance of the suburban front garden threatens millions with far more serious consequences and could ultimately help to bring Britain's major towns and cities to a grinding halt. </p> <p>They say the loss of front lawns is exacerbating the threat of widespread flooding following thunderstorms similar to those of recent weeks. Updated advice from the Environment Agency urges home owners to 'resist laying concrete or Tarmac over the whole' of front gardens. </p> <p>Front lawns provide a vital natural sponge for rainwater in urban areas. Without them, rain simply runs off driveways, increasing the likelihood of downpours overwhelming antiquated sewerage systems. The widespread flooding that followed the recent downpours, when millions of gallons of water were dumped on towns and cities in a few hours, offers a pointer to what will come. </p> <p>A fetid stench still hovers above the Thames after heavy rains last week again exposed London's dwindling cover of foliage. As much as 600 million litres of faeces and waste have made their way into the river. In response, the government's environment watchdog is telling homeowners across the UK to resist paving their gardens entirely. </p> <p>Councils such as that in Leicester are advising residents to keep their front gardens 'green'. Leading architects are concerned that the growing number of driveways are storing up problems. </p> <p>Robin Nicholson, a mem ber of the government-funded Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, describes the loss of lawns and flower beds as 'a lazy' solution to parking shortages: 'We know converting front gardens is leading to flooding and a number of local authorities are increasingly aware of this. We need to look at other solutions.' </p> <p>The environmental concerns do not end there. The loss of sunlight-absorbing plants can intensify the 'heat island effect', making the centre of cities several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside. </p> <p>Some London boroughs receive more than 1,000 applications a year from homeowners wanting to lower the kerbs outside their houses so that they can drive their cars right up to their front doors. In the affluent London borough of Kingston, 350 residents have applications in to convert their front lawns into parking areas. Councillors expect to approve three-quarters of these, with officials admitting a 'steady rise' in recent years. </p> <p>Horticulturalists believe that unless efforts are made to save the front garden as an institution, it will become a rarity. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is so concerned it is contemplating issuing advice to its 350,000 members on how they can build a parking space while retaining a colourful garden. </p> <p>Geoff Stokes, secretary of the National Society of Allotments and Leisure Gardeners, is among the homeowners whose front garden offers a lone burst of colour on a residential street. </p> <p>'Many are used as parking or for dumping rubbish or just for keeping the dustbin in. The front garden is now looked at as an additional space for living, rather than as something to enhance the neighbourhood,' he said. </p> <p>Many housing developments do not even bother with the notion of a front garden, a far cry from the observations of a French tourist in 1829, who wrote: 'The taste for gardens in England is so pronounced that one finds them before almost every house.' </p> <p>'It used to be somewhere you were proud of; it reflected status and that you were a respectable, law-abiding person,' said Guy Barter of the RHS. 'Now they are no longer valued as they used to be. We need to think more deeply about the role of the front garden in today's society.'</p>",
  "<p>When you go to the Olympic Games the sheer scale of it slaps you in the face. You turn up to get your accreditation pass and discover that you are only one of thousands of competitors, all in their team colours, who have come from every corner of the world. It's very daunting to realise that you're a part of this massive global celebration. </p> <p>My first Olympics was Barcelona in 1992. Even when I watched Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell win their gold medals on the TV in my living room before I left, I still felt strangely detached. It was only when I flew into Barcelona and watched Colin Jackson in the final of the 110m hurdles on one of the screens at the airport that me being at the Olympic Games seemed real . </p> <p>The athletes usually all stay at the Olympic village. I knew in advance that life in the village wouldn't be great, though, so I deliberately didn't arrive until Day 10 or 11. There's the boredom factor in the village, plus the fact that you spend your whole day eating and drinking in the canteen, which isn't a great idea. But the main problem is that the village becomes such a commotion of emotion, a cauldron of expectation and competition, and you end up riding the emotions of your fellow competitors by discussing other athletes' hopes, fears and moods with them. You might, for instance, have breakfast with someone who's going off to compete in their final that day and they're really tense. Getting involved like that is a mistake. You shouldn't let other people's tension rub off on you or it will set a bad atmosphere. You have to be selfish and only think of yourself. </p> <p>Competing in the Olympics is like Judgement Day for the athletes. Magnify by 100 times what it's like sitting in the dentist's waiting-room for the nurse to call your name; it's not like playing your mate at squash on a Friday night. You are a mixture of fear and anxiety, and you realise that there are athletes from every country trying to stop you doing what you do, and that their country has as much pride as we all do in Team GB. </p> <p>Just being at an Olympics is like being in a pressure cooker. It's incredibly intense and, in my experience, it all comes down to how you respond to that pressure. In Sydney four years ago, it wasn't until I went back to Stadium Australia for the closing ceremony that I realised how big it was, because during qualifying, the final and even the javelin medal ceremony, I couldn't look up at the crowd. Until then I had been totally engrossed in my event and the forces I needed to create to throw that javelin and wasn't relaxed enough to look up and take it all in. If well-wishers in the crowd shouted \"come on Steve\", I didn't hear them. You need to be intensely focused. </p> <p>I remember in Barcelona bumping into Linford and Sally as they came back into the village with their medals in their hands, showing them to people. I almost didn't want to see them, not out of superstition, but because as someone who uses sports psychology, I believe that if you look to the finishing-post, it will distract you. I don't want to think about being on the podium or having my country's flag draped over me until I've won a medal. But I admit I did have a quick glimpse at theirs. I couldn't help doing that. It seemed to me that Linford and Sally's aura had changed, that they were a foot taller than when I'd seen them the day before. That's the effect of winning a gold medal. </p> <p>There are no low points to being at an Olympics, but also there's nothing light-hearted about it either. The people who used to have a laugh and a joke during competition, like Lee Trevino in golf and Jimmy Connors in tennis, those characters aren't around anymore. These days the margins at the top level of all sports are so narrow that people have to suppress any extrovert characteristics they have, because elite sport is so important and so competitive. So everyone is serious, intense, focused. A few still like to be light-hearted, but they aren't the warriors, the gladiators, the ones who regard it as life and death, like Linford. When he was competing he would have run over his best mate to get to that line without even seeing him, because he was so focused. I'm one of them, and happy to be in that mould. </p> <p> <strong>Steve Backley will be writing for The Observer during the Olympics. </strong></p>",
  "<b> Preventive measure</b> <br> <p>Before the first starting pistol was fired, the Greeks said the Athens Olympics would be a record-breaker. For starters, the 28th Olympiad has an unprecedented 202 participating nations, more than ever before. But perhaps the real record goes to Durex for being determined to make these the sexiest games of all times. The company has brought half a million condoms to the city of the Gods. All, I am told, are aimed at the 10,500 athletes in the Olympic village. By my calculation that makes three condoms, per athlete, per day. </p> <p><b> Mexican rave</b><br> </p> <p> Who would have thought of the Mexican journalist as a menace? Greek security personnel - and 70,000 of them guard Olympic sites and streets - are spending less time worrying about terrorists causing trouble than our eagle-eyed amigos. Police say they have lost count of 'incidents' involving Mexican TV crews filming off-limits. Rising to the occasion, the Mexican ambassador has appealed to his compatriots to uphold the principles of 'Olympic fair play' and follow the rules.</p> <p><b> Logos are no-go</b><br> </p> <p>Beware of logos! One of the hidden perils of these Olympics is offending the big-dollar companies, such as Coca-Cola, which have sponsored the Games. Organisers say spectators will be forcibly ejected from venues if they wear, or carry, items with 'obvious logos of competitive companies'. </p> <p>For some mystifying reason, the restrictions also extend to the display of flags representing nations not participating in the Games. </p> <p> <b> Constant presence</b><br> </p> <p>No one, it seems, is enjoying himself more than former king Constantine II. As a 1960 Olympic gold medalist, he is an honorary member of the IOC and, as such, has said he will be in Athens throughout the Games. Officialdom is putting on a brave face. President Costis Stephanopoulos even invited him to a garden party, along with the likes of Tony and Cherie Blair, the first time in nearly 40 years that the ex-king had a glimpse of his former palace. He was stripped of his citizenship and property by the socialist government.</p> <p> <b> Flaming return</b><br> </p> <p>On its global marathon, the Olympic flame received celebrity treatment, but it was Britain's Naomi Campbell who stole the show. As one of the last torchbearers to carry the light before it entered the stadium, the supermodel was especially gushing about Athens' new look. The city was not only beautiful, it had changed enormously, she said. 'Even since I was here two weeks ago, it looks better.' There may be an explanation. The last time Campbell was in Athens she spent most of her time refusing to emerge from her chauffeur-driven car because of paparazzi. </p> <p> <b> Winning Nike</b><br> </p> <p>The Greeks have ensured that the medals have had a radical makeover. Gold, silver and bronze now depict Nike, the goddess of victory, and Athens' Panathenaic stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896. Previous depictions of the goddess next to a Roman stadium had incensed the locals.</p>",
  "<p>The only time I met Jeffrey Archer, he was ranting about the Greeks. 'These bloody people, they couldn't organise their way out of a paper bag.' </p> <p>It was the eve of the 1997 World Athletics Championships in Athens. Archer was standing in the foyer of the Hilton, fuming because an overworked saleswoman in the hotel bookshop had had the temerity to keep him waiting. 'To think that they're organising these games is a real joke,' he grumbled. 'They're bloody hopeless.' His tirade was embarrassing. But what struck me more, living in Greece and being British, was the ferocity of such Anglo-Saxon condescension. It was both disquieting and buffoonish. In the event, the championships were the best of recent times. </p> <p>As Greeks defy sceptics with world-class sports venues and a vastly improved city for the Olympics, I wonder what put-downs Archer and his ilk will come up with now? That Athens 2004 isn't a patch on what London could be in 2012? Or perhaps they will take a leaf out of Tessa Jowell's book? After touring the Greek capital last week, the British sports minister could only exclaim: 'We are here to learn ... and support the city in the face of doomsayers - they have turned it around.' </p> <p>Greece is the smallest country to stage the Olympics, which are the biggest ever. The feat will help dispel some of the self-doubt and nagging inferiorities that torment Greeks. Not even the humiliation of seeing the farcical flight from drug testers of their two star athletes could take the gloss off Friday's magnificent opening ceremony. </p> <p>If the Games go as well and remain incident-free - and the Greeks have spent a record \u00a3900 million providing security for the event - the organisers may just succeed in proving that Athens is no longer Europe's Christian Orthodox 'odd-man out'. That, actually, it can very effectively 'organise its way out of a paper bag'. But will the Olympics also change the prejudices against Hellenes? </p> <p>In Britain, it seems, there is still a readiness to think of the Greeks as barely civilised: they are all called Zorba, sport bushy moustaches and smash plates. If not that, then they are corrupt southern Europeans with a criminal justice system that goes out of its way to target British plane spotters. Such stereotypes are born of an idea of Greece as a Balkan backwater, a country that has no place in the European Union. </p> <p>Again and again, in the course of reporting from Greece, I have met such prejudices. What still surprises me, though, is the extent to which they appear to have colonised the minds of people I might otherwise respect. </p> <p>A year spent in the irrepressibly progressive environment of Harvard, as the new century dawned, only served to highlight how entrenched and peculiarly British such views tend to be. Like our fondness for that cliche of Greeks bearing gifts, we seem unable to abandon our belief that modern Greece is a contradiction in terms. Increasingly, I find myself thinking the British, rather than the Greeks, are trapped in outdated mindsets. </p> <p>As a Briton, I find much to squirm about, whether it's the Elgin marbles or my compatriots running wild in vomit-splattered Faliraki or feckless, bare-breasted English girls being incarcerated in Greek jails, which are, naturally, described as 'medieval' in the British press. </p> <p>Few ever stop to think how the British might behave if hordes of unprepossessing, out-of-control Greeks invaded our coasts? More often than not, Greek authorities react to such excesses with a leniency far beyond the call of duty. </p> <p>No one can deny the Greeks' bewildering last-minute work ethic. In recent months, preparations for the Games appeared so chaotic that they bordered on the burlesque. But, sadly, stereotypes tend to colour political views. </p> <p>What people tend to forget is just how far the Greeks have come. Three decades ago, Athens was under the iron grip of small-minded military dictators, men as intent on banning mini-skirts as banishing leftists to remote island prisons. </p> <p>Now, Hellenes worry not about human rights or the rule of law, but consumer goods and their second homes overlooking the sea. It is all the more miraculous when you remember that before the colonels came years of wars, coups and near-constant political and social unrest. </p> <p>It is true that with their extraordinary ability to be their own worst enemy, the tumult was often self-inflicted. The disastrous 1923 Pelepponese campaign, subject of Louis de Berni\u00e8re's latest book, did not enhance the country's reputation. Nor did Athens's fiercely pro-Serbian and less than magnanimous stance in the recent Balkan wars. </p> <p>But Greece is changing. Just as the country is no longer the economic laggard of the European Union (at around 4 per cent, its GDP growth rates are the second highest in the eurozone), it is no longer the political juvenile of yore. The trenchant nationalism of the 1980s and early 1990s is no more; instead of generating firebrand politicians with only thinly disguised dreams of conquering Constantinople, it produces men and women who want only to improve relations with Turkey. </p> <p>Progressive immigration policies, an area for which Greece deserves more credit, are rapidly changing the country's ethnic make-up. Around 10 per cent of its 11-million strong population are now foreign-born, mostly Albanian, although increasingly from the former Soviet republics, Africa and the Middle East. Admittedly, Greece was never a multicultural paradise; treatment of newcomers has not always been exemplary. But I have often wondered what the reaction would be in other European countries to such a great influx. </p> <p>In years to come, others might contemplate the wisdom of tasking small states such as Greece with the organisation of a show such as the Olympics. But of one thing there can be no doubt: no other single event has so effectively transformed or revitalised Athens in the 180-plus years since Greece won independence from the Ottoman Turks. </p> <p>In one fell swoop, it seems, the Greeks have cleaned up their act. They have cracked the nasty November 17 (the group that killed British military attache Stephen Saunders); they've used EU funds and dug deep into their coffers to build highways, a sophisticated transport network, a gleaming new airport and a metro system that makes the London Underground look primitive. </p> <p>They haven't built a new Acropolis Museum yet, but they've united all their ancient masterpieces into a giant and spectacular archaeological park, no mean feat in a city of more than four million people. How long has it taken to even agree to build London's Crossrail? It is unlikely it will be ready by 2012. </p> <p>The new Greeks are innovative. In contrast to the patronising eggheads who govern the likes of the British Museum, they come up with forward-looking polices: 'Why not loan us the Elgin marbles, instead of 'giving them back' and we'll display them in a branch of the British Museum beneath the Parthenon?' </p> <p>Lovers of Greece will weep to see that acceptance has taken so long, but it could prove to be one of the greatest legacies of the Games. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Will Hutton is away</p>",
  "<p>For all the imagery of cloud-shrouded mountains, rocky gorges and graceful rivers, China has never paid much attention to preserving its environment. Taoists advocated going with the natural flow but, from the early emperors to Mao, the emphasis was on mastering nature - both from necessity and as a symbol of man's superiority. </p> <p>Now the battle between the world's most populous nation and its environment has reached an unprecedented pitch, posing fundamental questions for the leadership in Beijing. </p> <p>Experts calculate the price of the damage China's environment is suffering at from 5 to 12 per cent of GDP - the flip side of its emergence as a world economic power. On one side lies the bounding growth - official figures show a 9.7 per cent rise in the first half of 2004 - on the other is a looming major disaster. </p> <p>There are still vast swathes of untouched countryside; huge areas in the south-west and many mountain ranges. But, for many of China's 1.3 billion people, the cost of growth is already all too evident. Rivers are full of industrial and human waste. Forests essential to the eco-system have been felled for timber, grasslands are being ploughed up. Desertification is spreading through northern provinces. Sandstorms blow through Beijing. Demand from factories and urban housing developments accentuate long-standing water distribution problems. Big rivers have had dry spells, while the building of the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtzi has created a huge lake in which parasitic worms dangerous to humans are endemic. </p> <p>In a survey of China's environment challenge, Dr Elizabeth Economy of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York reports that 60 million people have limited access to water; 10 times as many drink contaminated water. </p> <p>The movements of tens of millions from the countryside in search of work in rapidly expanding cities puts a major strain on urban infrastructure while the explosive growth in the use of cars and trucks adds to air pollution. </p> <p>Forty per cent of the rural population lack sanitation and the dangers of epidemics were shown dramatically by the spread of Sars. </p> <p>The government has launched plans to try to turn back the degradation and pursue sustainable development. But too often the effects have been limited. Officials report a successful outcome when investigation shows major difficulties remain. </p> <p>In encouraging the move from Maoism to the market, the patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, devolved the job to local officials who frequently have investments in factories, giving them a vested interest in not applying too strictly regulations that could reduce output. Equally, it is easy for them to tip off factory managers an inspection is due. </p> <p>China produces an estimated 60 billion tonnes of polluted water a year. The saga of the Huai river, as recounted by Economy, is an example of how things go wrong. The size of England, the fertile Huai valley is home to 150 million people. Under Mao, 200 dams were built to stop flooding - 200,000 people drowned when two collapsed in 1973. After Deng changed China's course at the end of the 1970s, tens of thousands of factories set up along the river and its tributaries. In 1994, some tanks were emptied into the river, flooding it with toxins, turning the water black, killing 26 million lbs of fish and making thousands of people ill. Five thousand factories were shut down; half subsequently re-opened. </p> <p>'Towns and villages continue to build small paper mills, dye works, tanneries and chemical works with crude equipment,' a local environmental officer reported. A clean-up campaign began in 1998. As it got going, waste again turned the water black. In 1999 and 2000, the Huai ran dry for the first time in 20 years. In 2001, the State Environmental Protection Administration declared the water good enough for drinking. A local expert found it was not even suitable for irrigation. Only six of 52 planned treatment plants had been built. </p> <p>Torrential rains that summer sent 38 billion gallons of water flooding over locks, covered with yellow foam, garbage and industrial waste. Another campaign was ordered, but in 2003 the water was still unsuitable for drinking, fishing or even, in some cases, industrial use. The clean-up cost is now put at $100bn. </p> <p>In the south, roads in booming Guangdong province are lined with mounds of industrial garbage and stagnant pools. The water by one site used to strip and burn circuit boards contains lead levels reported to be 2,400 times higher than World Health Organisation drinking guidelines. In Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, the water has to be so heavily chlorinated that the local beer is virtually undrinkable. </p> <p>From the summit of Shanghai's tallest building, the city 100 floors below can barely be seen through the haze. In Hong Kong, air pollution is boosted by the industrial zones across the border. </p> <p>Nowhere is the problem worse than in the energy industry that struggles to keep up with insatiable demand. Coal-fired stations provide 75 per cent of China's electricity. Cheaper to build than nuclear plants (and China has plenty of coal), as well as smoke, they emit dioxins and other pollutants that cause acid rain and breathing disorders estimated to kill 400,000 people a year. </p> <p>After half a dozen Chinese cities were ranked among the 10 most polluted on Earth in the late 1990s, the government launched a clean-up campaign. From 2000 to 2002, levels dropped, but 2003 showed a 12 per cent increase. </p> <p>The prime reason is the sheer scope of development and things are made worse by spotty enforcement of pollution controls; it is often cheaper to pay pollution levies than to refit plants with cleaning equipment. Even more coal is likely to be used after recurrent energy blackouts, including a 30,000-megawatt shortfall, the worst for two decades. Adding to that are the hundreds of millions of homes using coal. </p> <p>China's neighbours are suffering. In South Korea, estimates put the share of air pollution originating in China at up to 40 per cent. There is also speculation that the effects may be felt in America - sand from the desertification of northern China is known to have crossed the Pacific. China is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, though, in its present state of development, is not bound by it. </p> <p>Its leaders claim a dedication to environmental improvements, yet action has been, at best, halting. Optimists hope that, as the country gets richer, it will give more power to environmental agencies. The present situation, they argue, is the natural outcome of its fast-track development. Pressure from abroad will also come as Beijing integrates more closely into global markets. </p> <p>For a country so focused on material progress, ecological degradation takes second place. The regime's calculation that growth is the route to legitimacy gives economic factors great political weight. Some figures in the hierarchy of the world's last major Communist nation appreciate the need for environmental reform. The irony is that, for all the monopoly power of the Party, change is becoming increasingly difficult, with terrible effects for the country itself, and a growing threat to others as well. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Jonathan Fenby is a former editor of the 'South China Morning Post' in Hong Kong and author of 'Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the China he Lost' (Free Press-Simon &amp; Schuster)</p>",
  "<p>Britain is facing a \u00a325 million claim for compensation from tribes in Papua New Guinea who claim the government has backed a project that destroyed their ancestral lands, poisoned their water and made them ill. </p> <p>Lawyers acting for indigenous communities of the south-east Asian island have written to Development Secretary Hilary Benn outlining their claim. They have detailed a catalogue of destruction allegedly caused by a 10,000-hectare oil palm plantation in Oro province, near their northern coast . </p> <p>The UK Department for International Development is the major shareholder in a company called Higaturu Oil Palms, the firm that runs the controversial plantation. It has put \u00a34m of British taxpayers' money into the company through the government-owned CDC Group, which invests aid money in projects it believes will benefit developing countries. </p> <p>The tribes claim Higaturu has used toxic chemicals to grow and process oil palms and that these have polluted the sole source of water for thousands of villages. Lawyers also claim the company has dug up ancestral graveyards and destroyed the sole habitat of the world's largest butterfly, Queen Alexandra's birdwing. </p> <p>The letter was sent to Benn by Damien Ase, executive director of Celcor, the Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights in Papua New Guinea. He has demanded the minister takes immediate action to halt the damage to the land and environment and 'fully compensate the local landowners'. </p> <p>Ase alleges that Higaturu illegally acquired the land from the tribes and caused damage by destroying rainforests and polluting rivers. The plantation began operating 26 years ago. </p> <p>Andrew Mamoko, chairman of the Ahora pressure group, which represents the local tribes, said: 'Now we are landless, and are just another lot of hopeless, lifeless people grieving over our land while others reap goodness out of it and enjoy it.' </p> <p>Oil from the palm trees provides a valuable harvest for developing countries, which export it for use as a vegetable oil in food or for cosmetics. The problem is that rainforest has to be cleared and chemicals used. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth, which is backing the claim, has collected testimony on videotape from tribespeople who have suffered. Theresa Stanley, who represents the women of the community, claims that children have been born with deformities and died as a result of the polluted waters. </p> <p>Chief Neville Ondopai of the Ahora Village said: 'All the people in these villages, they drink the water and they are dying. How can they exploit us so much?' </p> <p>Lawyers claim that toxic waste was dumped directly into the Ambogo river, which is used by thousands of villagers. </p> <p>CDC, which is wholly owned by the British government, has its funds managed by private equity group Actis. A spokesman for Actis said: 'We take these sorts of allegations very seriously and are committed to working with the management of Higaturu to ensure improvement in the environmental management of its palm oil plantations.' </p> <p>In a detailed statement, Actis rejected many of the claims of the tribes. It said: 'Higaturu has systems in place designed to ensure that its discharges into the river do not create health or environmental damage and we do not believe that Higaturu's activities are responsible for the health problems facing the local community.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "President George Bush will announce tomorrow that the US military will pull up to 100,000 troops out of Europe and Asia in the biggest redeployment since the end of the Cold War. <p>The plan will see a number of US bases in Germany closed down, and troops returned home or redeployed to Eastern Europe. </p> <p>The redeployment - first reported by The Observer in February last year in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq - will be presented by Bush as a logical response to the war on terrorism when he addresses the 2.6 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars at its annual convention in Cincinnati. </p> <p>In February last year, however, when the proposal was first mooted, Pentagon officials presented the closure of the bases in Germany as punishment for Germany's refusal to back the war in Iraq. </p> <p>Pentagon officials, who confirmed the planned announcement in yesterday's Washington Post, said the change is necessary to adapt the nation's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technology. </p> <p>But the planned restructuring also comes amid overstretch in a US army struggling to juggle commitments in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theatres, and has been responsible for declining morale particularly in combat units. </p> <p>According to the Post, two-thirds of the reduction will come from Europe, most of them Army soldiers in Germany, and most will be reassigned to bases in the US. </p> <p>Officials said exact details of the moves have not been finalised, but some of the troops from Germany and South Korea will be moved to Nato expansion countries in Eastern Europe. </p> <p>While Bush will emphasise the changing nature of the threat, it is clear that morale within the US military in an election year is a crucial issue as the death toll in Iraq rises. Discontent has been growing among relatives of servicemen and women, some who have barely been home between the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. </p> <p>Any planned redeployment is likely to follow lengthy negotiations with the countries where the troops are stationed. At present, more than 60 per cent of the US Army - some 320,000 troops - are deployed overseas and former senior military officers claim the army is cracking under the strain. </p> <p>The rapid turnaround in deployments in units has resulted in a growing retention crisis. Already US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld has allowed the Army to add 30,000 troops temporarily to its total to help meet the overstretch crisis, while the Pentagon has also used emergency powers to force some soldiers whose enlistments are up to stay.</p>",
  "Gay couples wanting a child are set to get easier access to fertility treatment under a shake-up of the law. <p>The creation of 'civil partnerships' - which give committed homosexual couples similar legal rights to married partners - alongside shifting social attitudes have persuaded ministers the time is ripe for a rethink. </p> <p>In a memo to a Commons inquiry into regulation of fertility treatment, the Department of Health argues the current law was 'framed in terms of heterosexual couples' and changes should be considered 'to better recognise the wider range of people who seek and receive assisted reproduction treatment in the 21st century'. </p> <p>While some doctors already offer IVF to lesbian couples or single women in private clinics, others refuse, forcing women into homemade arrangements involving male friends and turkey basters. The law obliges private and NHS clinics to consider an unborn baby's potential welfare and 'need for a father' before allowing treatment, meaning women without male partners may have to show a child would have close male role models. </p> <p>Ministers will not consult the public on the review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, the 1990 law governing treatment, until next spring and the Department of Health insists it has taken no view on whether to scrap the stipulation for fathers. </p> <p>But a spokeswoman for the department said moves to let committed gay couples register their partnerships - opening the door to tax and pension benefits, and providing for 'divorces' and custody of any children - changed matters, adding: 'This is looking at the consequences the civil partnerships legislation has on the current legislation. (The Act) is obviously from 1990, and because of the changes that have happened since we are looking at the whole area.' </p> <p>New controls are also likely on fertility clinics selling sperm over the internet and surrogacy. </p> <p>Ministers are also studying possible developments, such as production of 'artificial sperm' for infertile men. Scientists have grown mouse sperm from embyronic stem cells: in theory, the technique could be used for humans. </p> <p>Gay rights groups say the requirement to consider the need for a father is interpreted in differing ways, with lesbians often facing more intensive cross-examination than straights. The stipulation has been condemned as an anachronism by Suzi Leather, chief executive of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. </p> <p>Campaigner Ben Summerskill, head of Stonewall, said: 'There is no evidence that this legislation ... has actually protected anyone from anything, and there is a range of US research which suggests that children who grow up in gay families are just as well balanced and developed as children who grow up in heterosexual families.' </p> <p>The debate over whether IVF children need a father is controversial, with the British Medical Association's ethics committee understood to be divided. The association is arguing that in the absence of evidence of harm, the need for a father should be 'subsumed' into a requirement to consider a child's welfare. </p> <p>Professor Alison Murdoch, chair of the British Fertility Society, said she personally favoured extending treatment for gay couples. </p> <p>'We have to stand back from it and say, what is the evidence that there is any harm to anybody from them having a child? Children need to be brought up in a loving, caring environment: it's the loving care that is important, not the sexuality of the parent,' she said. </p> <p>'We have been in a situation in the past where lesbian couples have been getting sperm from the gay community - they're unscreened, they're untested, there's no legal framework. </p> <p>'People who come to me and say \"can you help?\", one could argue that they are the people being responsible.'

  "<p>In the dusty valleys of Sumdoh, where the villages barely cling to the steep slopes of the high peaks of the Indian Himalayas, where winter temperatures drop to -30C, and where the frost splinters roads into rubble in months, they are waiting. High above, behind the crags that rim their desolate valley homes, is a lake. Old shepherds remember it as an oversized pond, but now it is a huge reservoir, swollen with the glacial melt caused by global warming, waiting to smash its way down the valley and out to the plains beyond. </p> <p>Last week, with the lake higher than ever, the Indian government began the laborious process of evacuating 12,000 villagers. The operation was carefully co-ordinated from the hill town of Simla. Chief Minister Vir Bhadr Singh reviewed the situation and said the government must prepare for the worst. But many thousands remain in the danger zone. </p> <p>Few outside India have heard about the crisis. This is not unusual. Across the world tens of millions of people are at risk from famine, disease and natural disasters, without anyone taking much notice. In Gujarat, in western India, 300,000 farmers have had their fields flooded; droughts have hit Sri Lanka, there are floods and landslides in Brazil and Haiti. </p> <p>Nor are the villagers of Sumdoh exaggerating the problems. When a lake flooded in the Caucasus in 2002 it destroyed a village 15 miles down stream, killing 100 people. Researchers at the United Nations Environment Programme have identified at least 44 potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the tiny Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal and Bhutan alone. </p> <p>Many aid workers say the current situation is the worst they have ever faced. The number of humanitarian emergencies is already higher than ever before. According to the Red Cross, there were around 400 reported disasters each year between 1993 and 1997. Between 2000 and 2002 there were more than 700. And a 'witches brew' of factors threatens to unleash many, many more that could bring misery to tens of millions and completely overwhelm the structures that exist to bring help to those who most need it. </p> <p>On the outskirts of Rome, in a vast business complex, a giant concrete office block houses the World Food Programme (WFP), the world's largest international aid agency and a key part of the UN's global assistance. Although Romans abandon their capital city for the beach in August, there is a tense buzz of activity inside the WFP headquarters. </p> <p>The programme is more stretched than it has ever been, and was involved in three times more emergencies in the Nineties than in the Seventies. 'We are at our limit. Nobody is quite sure how we will manage when the next thing comes. But we all know it will come,' said Brenda Barton, its chief spokesperson. </p> <p>Senior WFP officials believe four major factors are causing the crisis. The first is that global warming is causing problems of a severity that has never been seen before. The rise in global temperatures - reckoned to be more than half a degree centigrade over the past year - has melted glaciers throughout the world, causing landslips, mudslides, flash floods and the swollen lakes that threaten Sumdoh. Warmer temperatures mean more evaporation which means more precipitation which means more flooding. WFP officials point to the recent floods in Bangladesh - the worst for six years - as an example of the sort of climate-related crisis they increasingly face. </p> <p>Another factor that senior figures at the programme say makes their job more difficult is the focus on the war on terror. With news agendas dominated by violence in Iraq or security scares in Europe, only the highest profile stories ever make it on to our television screens and newspaper front pages. </p> <p>'We are facing a major problem of priorities,' said John Powell, the WFP's deputy executive director. 'The international community has great concern that we keep capacity in Iraq for the next couple of months. But at the same time, there are tens of millions of people who don't know where their next meal is coming from. We don't seem to be able to engender the same degree of concern for many other places in the world.' </p> <p>Powell said press coverage is critical. 'The media is an indispensable ingredient in the recipe for success,' he said. 'But it's a fact that there are disasters which are less prominent. Altogether there are 800 million people in the world who do not have enough to eat each and every day. And nobody talks about it or writes about it.' </p> <p>One example raised by WFP officials is the current devastation wrought by massive locust swarms in sub-Saharan Africa. A plague of locusts, generated by unusually strong and regular rain, has cut a swathe from the western Maghreb across Mauritania, Niger and Chad and is heading for southern Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the violence of government-sponsored militia are already at grave risk. </p> <p>The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), another major UN body, launched an appeal for aid to mount operations to counteract the locust swarm in the autumn of last year. This appeal was renewed twice during the spring, but a bare minimum of funds was forthcoming and, though the richer countries such as Algeria and Libya were able to mount effective campaigns, the poorer sub-Saharan countries just had to take their chances. </p> <p>'We have had big damage in the oases already, especially to market vegetable gardens,' said Mohamed El Haceu Ould Jaavar, chief of intervention at Mauritania's National Locust Centre. 'The situation is critical. We don't have the means to cope with the situation. We need vehicles, planes and pesticides to treat the locust.' </p> <p>The continuing famine in North Korea is another example of how politics and climate can interact with devastating results. Following earlier flood warnings, the Red Cross is now reporting that nearly 40,000 families have been displaced in North Korea as a result of heavy rains. </p> <p>The rainy season has also washed away at least 100,000 hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields and cut roads and rail links, mainly in the south of the country. The northernmost province of Ryanggang is currently inaccessible because bridges on the main road were destroyed by the floods. Yet, with North Korea listed in Washington's Axis of Evil, aid for the state has been cut by 80 per cent since 2001. </p> <p>According to Powell, the WFP had to make a nightmarish decision. 'Do we feed the pregnant women and the malnourished children or do we feed the elderly? We could no longer do both. So we stopped giving food rations to the elderly. We have had to cold bloodedly categorise people. It's an excruciating decision to have to make.' </p> <p>And, even as problems intensify, the ability of the WFP's staff to cope is diminishing. High international oil prices have forced costs up. And United Nations staff are increasingly targets, making expensive security arrangements necessary and curtailing operations in sensitive areas. Two major non-governmental organisations (NGOs) recently pulled out of Afghanistan because of concerns over the safety of their staff. </p> <p>Yet the WFPs dramatic stance is controversial. The exact cause of the wave of natural disasters is unclear and some doubt a link to climate change. Dr Mark Saunders, a scientist at University College, London, runs a tropical storm forecasting centre. He said that though the year had been 'active', that does not mean the long-term trend is towards more tropical storms. 'There is not evidence of any significant trend over the past 20-30 years. Global change is happening, the question is what the impact might be. One can expect increased flooding but there is no definitive study.' </p> <p>Clive Elliott, the FAO's locust expert, said it was impossible to link locust swarming to climate change. Nor is it necessarily the case that the war on terror is a distraction - though humanitarian assistance may suffer disproportionately when public attention is not drawn to emergencies, argue some. </p> <p>Many specialists claim that the focus on overseas events sparked by current security concerns actually marks a huge opportunity for development work, and point out that global aid flows are at their highest level for years. </p> <p>The Department for International Development is spending \u00a3165 million in Iraq this year and next. Around a third of this money has been transferred from programmes in other middle income countries, the rest has come from the department's contingency fund. This, officials say, is easily covered by a budget that has increased by \u00a31.2 billion over the last two years to a total of \u00a34.5bn. This has allowed, officials say, a rapid response to crises in Darfur and Bangladesh. </p> <p>'The money being spent in Iraq does not mean pulling back on humanitarian funding elsewhere,' one official told The Observer. 'It is an easy answer to say that because of a focus on security we can't fund [action against] locusts. I don't think there is an overall shortage of financing but there are some structural issues that need addressing.' </p> <p>Some say that all those involved in 'the aid industry' need to take a long, hard look at themselves. Dr Peter Walker, director of the Feinstein International Famine Center at Tufts University in Boston, has recently completed a major report, commissioned by such high profile NGOs as Oxfam, World Vision, Save The Children and the International Rescue Committee, into their field of work. </p> <p>The report is critical of the way many aid organisations work, saying it is unrealistic for aid workers to be based in the West, flying out on 'high intensity fire fighting missions' to deliver assistance. This must be rectified, he argues. Aid workers, if not recruited locally, should at least live locally, he says, allowing costs to be cut and more appropriate services to be delivered. </p> <p>What is certain, however, is that demands will grow in coming years. 'In future, disasters will become larger and more cataclysmic and will be increasingly related to extreme weather events,' said Walker. The villagers of Sumdoh province know that already. </p> <p><strong> 2004:A year of living dangerously</strong></p> <p><strong>January:</strong> Mudslides triggered by torrential rains kill more than 30 people in south-east Brazil.

  "Last week, Donald Rumsfeld visited Kabul and announced a US-led drive to wean Afghanistan off its dependence on the opium trade. Some 120,000 hectares of opium poppy were planted last year, the country's biggest-ever crop. Many fear Afghans were freed from the Taliban merely to see the state taken over by drug-traffickers, a tragedy for them and us; 90 per cent of heroin reaching Britain is grown in Afghanistan. <p>As important, a narco-state would be a gift to terrorists. Afghanistan demonstrates how the objectives of international aid and global security coincide. Fighting the war on terror has meant much-needed development aid for one of the poorest countries on earth. </p> <p>This should help allay the fears of the World Food Programme, which we report today, that global preoccupation with security comes at the expense of the world's poorest people. The WFP is right to be concerned but the truth is that, post-9/11, our fears about security can act as a positive factor in world development, removing long-standing political obstacles to helping the world's poor and motivating richer countries to make sacrifices for the greater good. </p> <p>Certainly, there are dangers that TV bulletins and front pages dominated by Iraq may squeeze out news of starving children and critical environmental issues. We must always be alert to humanitarian emergencies while directing aid intelligently to longer-term development. </p> <p>Afghan peasants do not plant opium because they want to but because they have to. Mr Rumsfeld is right to want to eradicate opium cultivation in Afghanistan but not to opt for a military solution, which would certainly backfire. Security and the war on terror go hand in hand with humanitarian concerns and development. We separate them at our peril.</p>",
  "<p>Parents coping with the distress of schizophrenia in their children have been caused further pain, a well-organised campaign would have us believe, by a series of articles in The Observer Magazine which examined the possibility that some parenting methods may actually be the cause of the condition. </p> <p>In the past few days I have received more than 100 near-identical letters and emails from parents and patients - all of whom had responded to a call from the website of the support group, Rethink, to send a pre-written letter, adding their own experiences if they wished. </p> <p>'You may have seen a series of articles on schizophrenia by the psychologist Oliver James,' says the website. He 'stated repeatedly that parental neglect and abuse is one of the main causes of schizophrenia in their children.' </p> <p>The letter pointed out that carers of people with mental illness often make huge personal sacrifices. 'Blaming them only increases misunderstanding about mental illness,' it said. </p> <p>Nobody would argue with that, but the letter says the articles 'put the responsibility for the onset of schizophrenia squarely at the foot of parents'. I have reread all the pieces and cannot agree with that, but more later. First, let's see what additions readers made to the letter. 'I cannot tell you how much pain my illness has caused those near and dear to me,' wrote a schizophrenia patient from Surrey. 'I believe you should consider your responsibilities before you publish again.' </p> <p>'In the case of my son, now aged 34, none of your theories fits his profile,' wrote a reader from Staffordshire. 'Brought up by loving parents and with a brother who is three years older, he was an extremely bright child and very easy-going. The illness manifested itself while he was at university and came as a terrible shock when the diagnosis was finally made.' </p> <p>So, what did Oliver James actually write? In a column headed 'Don't blow your fuse: Positive and negative forces at home impact on a child's mental wellbeing', he said: 'Parents' negativity and tendency to be mystifying were measured in families with problem boys who had not yet developed any signs of schizophrenia. </p> <p>'Fifteen years later, the more pathological the parents had been in the boys' childhood, the greater their likelihood of being schizophrenic or of having symptoms. Where parents had been neither negative nor mystifying, none of the men had signs of schizophrenia.' </p> <p>Acknowledging that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, he quoted a study of children of schizophrenic mothers who were adopted at an early age, and were at risk of developing the condition. If combined with 'mystifying' care during upbringing in the adoptive family, the likelihood was greater. 'So, genes can have an effect, but only if the family environment is of the kind that fulfils schizophrenic potential.' </p> <p>And here is the nub. Those who have to tackle this distressing condition believe Oliver James's articles only add to their problems. But these are not his theories: they are the fruit of years of study within the profession, and, upsetting as they doubtless appear, they none the less bear examination and discussion. I put this to Oliver James, who replied: 'It is very understandable that parents with schizophrenic children would be upset. However, the campaign against my articles has deliberately misrepresented them by suggesting that I am blaming. Nowhere do I do any such thing. Rather, I am pointing to a number of undeniable facts. </p> <p>'If 100 schizophrenics had a a genetically identical twin, between three-quarters and one half of the 'Identikits' will not have the illness. In these cases, whatever else may have caused schizophrenia in their twin sibling, it could not have been genes since they have identical genes, The Royal College of Psychiatrists and other researchers have almost all ignored the possibility that family relationships could be the cause in such cases.' </p> <p><strong>&amp;183;</strong> Write to Stephen Pritchard, Readers' Editor,The Observer,119 Farringdon Rd, London EC1R 3ER, tel 0207713 4656, fax 0207713 4279 or email <a href=\"mailto:reader@observer.co.uk\">reader@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Sky-high oil prices are threatening to send the global economy into a spin, but to what extent are the big oil multinationals to blame for the crisis? Much has been made about disruption to supplies from Iraq, booming demand from China and the fact that world's appetite for oil is close to outstripping what the producing nations can produce. </p> <p>The top 10 independent oil companies account for 20 per cent of global production, and they are raking in cash from the high oil price, and giving it back to shareholders through share buybacks and chunky dividends. </p> <p>Jon Rigby, oil analyst at Commerzbank, says this is because capital expenditure 'is not being flexed. That is why cash is coming back to shareholders.' But he also suggests that such spending has not been 'flexed' throughout the current oil price cycle, which saw prices averaging a rock bottom $12.72 in London and $14.39 in New York in 1998. </p> <p>So are the companies partly to blame for the current surge, which could see prices nearly treble the 1998 average this year, because they failed to develop new supplies quickly enough? </p> <p>Clearly, expecting them to balance world demand is unrealistic - they do not operate as a cartel, restricting supply to manipulate price, in the way Opec does: they sell all their output. Yet could they have invested earlier to ensure that greater capacity was available now? </p> <p>Rigby says: 'When the price was low, they were probably underinvesting.' </p> <p>Indeed, the raw figures for the for the top 10 companies compiled by oil industry consultant Wood Mackenzie show a drop from $45.9 billion in 1998 to $36bn in 1999. The total did not return to 1998 levels until 2001, before accelerating last year to $57.6bn. </p> <p>However, Derek Butter of Wood Mackenzie says: 'Companies are now spending at record levels. The reasons for the high price are not simply on the supply side; it is also a consequence of surging demand, coupled with supply disruptions, particularly in Iraq and Nigeria, due to civil unrest.' </p> <p>The firms themselves emphasise that capital spending is dictated by long-term considerations, not price volatility. </p> <p>But most have recently revised upwards their expectations of the long- term oil price, while City analysts say the size of their investment is inevitably affected by cash generation and the market price. </p> <p>Rigby says: 'Capital expenditure is not going up in cyclical terms. There is a view in the market now that the level of capacity comfort above demand is due to the low spending by both nationalised oil companies (such as Saudi Aramco) and independent companies.' </p> <p>Adjusting the raw spending figures by linking them to production gives a clearer idea of the trend throughout the cycle, as firms pump oil more when the price is higher. So in 1998, the ratio of expenditure to production was 3.4 times. It fell to 2.6 the following year, and did not reach 1998 levels again until 2003.' </p> <p>Rigby says: 'You find that the oil companies reacted very quickly on the downside, and have been much slower to come back up to mid-cycle levels.' </p> <p>Butter has a caveat: while there is a link between spending and production, it is a lagging one, and the production figures from the top 10 companies have been boosted by mergers and takeovers. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the trend may be prudent. BP for example, spent freely in the Eighties on exploration and production, as did Shell in the Nineties, but with unhappy returns. And in the short term this may have contributed to today's cash bonanza and the highlighting of oil companies as top picks by equity market strategists. </p> <p>However, in the longer term, compa nies maintain their value by finding more oil to pump (major finds have declined and replacement of reserves has been slipping), while energy consumers hope they will keep finding it to keep prices down.' </p> <p>Different companies have different records. Those of the UK giants, BP and Shell, are mixed. BP's performance is obscured by the huge mergers with Amoco and Arco of the US that transformed its scale. Shell had a major overhaul in 1998, partly spurred by the lower oil price, that saw it impose harsh capital discipline. One analyst says: 'At Shell this definitely resulted in underspend.' </p> <p>Consolidation, such as BP's US tie-ups, Exxon link with Mobil, Chevron's with Texaco, and the combining of Total, Fina and Elf, have also marginally affected total capital spending, as budgets have been trimmed as part of the merger process. </p> <p>But exploration budgets, rather than those for developing discoveries, have been hit hardest. Total exploration spending for the 10 in 1998 was $11.3bn. Last year it was $8bn. </p> <p>The companies point to a number of reasons for this. BP, for example says that following poor performance in the Eighties chasing small finds in the North Sea, chief executive Lord Browne focused on large 'elephant' finds where costs were lower. The problem has been the decline of such finds. One company official says: 'Accessing reserves gets more difficult, simply because there is not the number of big fields.' </p> <p>Butter adds: 'New field exploration results in the past few years have not been particularly good. There has not been the opening of major new provinces which we saw in the mid-Nineties when the independents's exploration success in deep water Angola and Nigeria was bolstered by a resurgence of exploration success in the US Gulf of Mexico and access to explore in Kazakhstan.' </p> <p>Under these circumstances the majors believe cash is better returned to shareholders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, development spending has shot up from $34.6bn to $49.5, as companies have raced to get finds in areas that were open to exploration in the Nineties ready to operate. </p> <p>Butter expects development spending in these areas to go on rising in the next two years, driving production growth of between 2 and 3 per cent until 2008. </p> <p>But in the longer term, the increased production in these areas is likely only to balance out declines in others - particularly in the North Sea, where it peaked five years ago, and in the 'lower 48' US states, he says. </p> <p>One area of growth would be in areas now operated by nationalised oil companies, often in Opec countries. Indeed, Opec, particularly the Middle East where costs are relatively low, is expected to be the main source of new future supply. Oil companies covet access to these areas. If they get it, investment may rise. If not, the faltering investment, particularly in exploration, that has emerged since 1998 may become permanent.</p>",
  "A couple of questions have been bothering me recently. Exactly when does the government expect the lights to start going out round Britain? And, more importantly, when do our masters think it might be timely to act? <p>I am scarcely alone in my concerns. Take energy expert Professor Rod Smith of Imperial College, London: 'We are going to get an awful shock in a few years when we run out of power to light our homes,' he says. 'It sounds incredible but it is looking increasingly likely.' Most other experts agree. We are heading for a power supply meltdown. </p> <p>Energy policy is a complex business, of course. Ministers must make controversial decisions: a reactor go-ahead here or a wind farm approval there. These will merely bring grief today and only provide benefits in a decade. Not much cop for ensuring your re-election - so most politicians give energy a body swerve. </p> <p>Hence our impending crisis. Thanks to our masters' career-induced paralysis, our nuclear power plants - which supply a quarter of our electricity - have been allowed to approach the end of shelf lives. All will be shut down - with the exception of Sizewell B - over the next two decades, most sooner than later. About 20 per cent of generating capacity will be lost. </p> <p>A bit of an issue here, you might think, given that new atomic plants take years to plan and construct. But there's more. Our economy is also expected to expand at about 2 per cent a year. And a growing economy needs electricity to nurture it. A total increase in demand of around 20 per cent is therefore expected for the next decade or so. </p> <p>Thus we face a rising need and a diminishing supply. Yet nothing has been done to soften that crisis, one that could burst upon us in a few years. </p> <p>So the government must act (as it should have done years ago). But how? We have been doing quite nicely on gas generators but cannot build more because their emissions would kill off our Kyoto pledge to cut carbon dioxide pollution. </p> <p>Then there are renewables, such as wind-power - a big environmentalists' favourite. And I certainly like them. Wind farms look graceful, and if their construction annoys that bellicose old Thatcher apologist Bernard Ingham, all the better. </p> <p>But there's a snag. Wind farms cover a lot of space but don't provide much power, as energy expert Ian Fells points out: 'If all the world's wind farms were concentrated in the UK, they would still only supply 10 per cent of the country's electricity,' he says. Or look at wave power. Scotland has one wave power generating station (on Islay) and two nuclear plants. If the latter pair were decommissioned today it would take 10,000 Islay stations to replace their output. </p> <p>We have, as scientists say, an order of magnitude shortfall. Smith is more direct. 'Anyone who thinks we can replace nuclear power stations with renewables is talking bollocks.' </p> <p>Of course, we could try technological fixes on existing power sources - like coal - to make them greener. Take carbon sequestration. Coal would be burned; then the resulting carbon dioxide would be filtered out and pumped into depleted oil wells where it would be stored and prevented from worsening our global warming crisis: a great idea but unproven and is certainly not the short-term fix we desperately need. </p> <p>And that leads us to the inevitable, heretical solution: a return to nuclear power. Tony Blair has already warmed to the notion, we are told. More importantly, green gurus like James Lovelock, father of the Gaia concept, now endorse nuclear power. It is 'the one safe, available, energy source' that will save us from the looming global catastrophe now posed by atmospheric warming, he says. Government chief scientist David King, once a nuclear sceptic, is also converted. Not surprisingly, green campaigners demur. </p> <p>And I sympathise. Having initially thought nuclear power was a life-saver that would prevent men having to crawl on their knees in the bowels of the Earth to provide our energy, I became disillusioned, like so many others, by the industry's failure to deliver. Indeed, I still cannot forgive its leaders for their inability to come clean about nuclear plants' hidden subsidies and their refusal to act on the still unresolved issue of waste disposal. </p> <p>But we are now rapidly running out of options. Only nuclear power provides the massive, stable output we need to form the secure electricity generation that our nation requires. Wind farms will not do. </p> <p>We do no yet need a major rebuilding programme, but we do need to act lest we lose our few remaining nuclear experts, the men and women we are very likely to rely on to take us into a 21st century of carbon-free energy production. We now urgently need a commitment to a modest nuclear programme to provide us with options to survive a very uncertain future. The alternative is grim, though at least we wouldn't have to worry about who turns off the lights when we go.</p>",
  "<p>It was a routine briefing on board Air Force One en route to Iowa for another stop on George Bush's campaign trail. The White House official spokesman, Scott McClellan, described an 'alarming picture' of al-Qaeda threats - and how they related to the arrest in Pakistan of an alleged al-Qaeda operative supposedly plotting against America. </p> <p>McClellan insisted he could not discuss the arrests that day of 13 terror suspects in Britain. But not everyone was so discreet. Over the next few days, anonymous officials in the US and Pakistan obligingly joined up the dots, unleashing a stream of information about an alleged breakthrough against al-Qaeda connected with the raids. It was all faithfully reported in British newspapers - including claims that photographs of Chancellor Gordon Brown had been found in seized computer files and allegations that one of the Britons arrested, Abu al-Hindi, was a highly regarded al-Qaeda recruiting sergeant. The Daily Mail 's front page on the Saturday before last subsequently declared: 'Bin Laden's UK general captured.' </p> <p>Such headlines have opened a major new fault line in the strict rules governing pre-trial reporting - the provisions under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 that are supposedly the bedrock of Britons' right to a fair trial. </p> <p>The act says nothing should be published once proceedings are active - effectively post-arrest - that poses 'substantial risk' of serious prejudice to a trial. But the case of the 13 suspects - nine of whom are still, at the time of writing, being questioned - demonstrates that in an age of global threat, with counter-terrorism agencies staging raids in several countries simultaneously and anxious to trumpet successes, information is no longer easily controlled. </p> <p>The Bush administration, which regards terror crackdowns as an electoral trump card and is accustomed to American journalists' freedom to report what they like about defendants in the run-up to a trial, has proved hard to silence - despite fears it could unwittingly prejudice any attempted extradition of terror suspects to the US . One Whitehall source admits that the Americans 'don't seem to realise' how the British system works. </p> <p>The threat of foreign intervention wrecking British trials has certainly worried the Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith. He issued a warning note to editors two days after the arrests advising against using information 'not emanating from official UK sources' that might be 'striking and/or memorable' but potentially inadmissible in court - a clear hint at overseas intelligence material. </p> <p>However, there is little incentive for restraint in British newspapers, whose readers can easily read the stories by surfing American websites or watching CNN. While the fact that something is available online is not a defence to contempt of court for those reprinting it, the Attorney-General's spokeswoman admits that 'you could say if it was everywhere anyway, you are going to have a better argument against it'. </p> <p>And the defiant American response to British criticism - national security adviser Condoleezza Rice retorted it was 'unconscionable' not to warn Americans about terror threats - suggests an alternative way forward. What if, rather than trying to halt the torrent of information, Britain simply scrapped the restrictions and placed its faith in jurors' common sense and ability to discount what they read or hear before entering court? </p> <p>Dan Tench, a media partner at law firm Olswang, argues that contempt laws should at least be interpreted more liberally over issues of national security, where there are strong public interest grounds. If members of the public can understand the complexities of a criminal trial, then they should also be trusted to treat media coverage with scepticism. He adds: 'They can't be infinitely wise on one hand and completely moronic on the other. The suggestion that jurors can't put extraneous facts out of their minds is ridiculous.' </p> <p>Contempt rules should not be used to prevent the press reporting background information months or even years ahead of a trial, he believes. Almost any information about a defendant could technically be adjudged prejudicial by an unsympathetic judge. The fact that fewer than a fifth of those arrested on terrorist charges have so far been charged may encourage risk-taking. </p> <p>Tench argues lawyers 'might have more sympathy if government ministers didn't say things that could be prejudicial themselves'. Last year, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, was investigated for - and eventually cleared of - contempt of court over remarks he made about a suspect arrested in Gloucester last year; Goldsmith, embarrassingly, was forced to retract comments he made about an ongoing court case during a public lecture in 2003. </p> <p>The advent of the internet has also complicated the picture: the Law Commission pointed out recently that while publishing a defendant's past convictions constitutes contempt, curious jurors can now Google the name of defendants to check their past. Given the impossibility of sweeping the internet for potentially prejudicial information, the commission suggested judges could direct jurors to ignore online material if necessary. </p> <p>Most lawyers agree that enforcement of the Contempt of Court Act has been quietly relaxed in recent years. 'Things have become a lot looser, because editors and journalists are no longer jailed and fines are minimal, especially compared with libel payouts,' says Duncan Lamont, media partner at City law firm Charles Russell. One notable exception was the collapse of the trial of Leeds footballers Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer in April 2001 following the publication by the Sunday Mirror of an interview with the father of the victim while the jury was considering its verdict. He claimed that the attack was racially motivated: the judge abandoned the trial. Sunday Mirror editor Colin Myler resigned and the paper was subsequently fined \u00a375,000 for contempt. </p> <p>Lamont, however, argues 'all hell would break loose' if contempt laws were scrapped, citing lurid press coverage of the arrest in Spain of several Leicester City football players on charges of sexual assault - which were subsequently dropped - earlier this year. Tales of the players' alleged behaviour, and their accusers' personal lives, dominated the front pages for days - a situation Lamont claims would have made a fair trial impossible had the events happened in Britain. 'That proved we can't trust the media to be sensible. It was absolute pandemonium,' he says. </p> <p>And while the US system involves no bars on pre-trial reporting, it does require radical steps to shield juries from the media in high-profile cases: 'You have to stick juries in hotels at the taxpayer's expense and deprive them of TV.' </p> <p>Similarly, the media circus surrounding John Leslie after it was suggested he was the anonymous alleged date rapist mentioned in TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson's memoirs prompted calls from MPs for anonymity for rape suspects - more draconian than anything under the 1981 Act. Leslie's case never came to court owing to lack of evidence. </p> <p>Like rape cases, terrorism cases stimulate intense public interest: but they also provide more media temptation, because terrorist suspects can be interrogated without charge for longer than criminal suspects - extending the period between arrest and charge, when contempt restrictions are often taken more seriously. </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, veteran of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four trials, argues a fair trial is now almost impossible in terrorism cases: 'The powers in the act are very strong but the Attorney-General does nothing, and by doing nothing he encourages the limits to be pushed further and further.' Even where there is no direct prejudice to the case, Muslims are tried against a backdrop of Islamophobia linking religion and terrorism, she suggests. </p> <p>One compromise suggested by Barry Hugill of Liberty, the civil liberties pressure group, is that greater openness should require greater rigour from journalists publishing material about terror suspects based on virtually uncheckable, unattributable, intelligence briefings: 'There ought to be some context. We want transparency, and we want openness, but alongside that we have to have objectivity. I wouldn't object to reasoned articles explaining the basis on which American intelligence or British intelligence have acted, so long as it is in context and has a \"health warning\".' </p> <p>The government, however, is not minded for reform. Proposals rejected by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, to extend contempt laws - banning the press from reporting all but minimal details from the minute a suspect is arrested - remain ominously under 'review', depending on media behaviour. </p> <p>And while the Attorney-General has dropped plans to issue formal guidance on reporting high-profile cases, last November's lecture, in which he condemned some coverage of the Soham murder trial as 'frankly unacceptable', left little doubt as to his views. </p> <p>The unanswered question, however, remains how far jurors themselves feel influenced by the media. Until now, it has been impossible to ask, since publication of the details of jury deliberations is banned - ironically, under the Contempt of Court Act. </p> <p>This autumn, the Lord Chancellor is expected to propose a relaxation of the law in order to allow academic research into juries. One such study, examining 41 cases in Australia between 1997 and 2000, found publicity may have influenced the verdict in only three. It concluded jurors simply couldn't recall press or television coverage of the cases beyond initial reports of the alleged offence. </p> <p>Similar studies here may just provide the first real understanding of how - if at all - the media influences jurors. The debate, it seems, is not over.</p>",
  "<p>Is House of Fraser a target or a predator? Two years ago Tom 'Richest man in Scotland' Hunter wanted House of Fraser, with a view to an alliance with Allders. Two struggling department store groups with, as he saw it, a brighter future together. Then Minerva and Terry Green acquired Allders and Green's pal, John Coleman, lived to fight another day. </p> <p>Now House of Fraser has a different feel. There are analysts who share the management's view that this business is just too pricey to be a bargain. </p> <p>Coleman's team set out their stall around improving poor margins and systems and sorting out the Mohamed al-Fayed debt hangover. They have put three percentage points on to the margins; sales and profits are growing at the same rate as Next's and the expansion programme is solid. </p> <p>In terms of future revenue, the House of Fraser Storecard is interesting. The last time we spoke to HoF, it refused to comment on the deal with GE Capital, largely because the terms are awful. Since then the storecard landscape has opened up as a result of consumer pressure and a Competition Commission inquiry. </p> <p>GE Capital now has serious competition from high-street banks - good for House of Fraser, currently negotiating a renewal on different terms or with the right to take back its business in 2007 with two years' notice. If the management cannot improve the terms - they receive no cut of the profits - in the current climate, they ought to resign in shame. </p> <p>We understand that the HoF card business is expanding. Newly trained staff are selling to a finance-savvy customer (in the ABC1 group) at ease with debt. </p> <p>Add to this the changing face of the retail competition. Selfridges has gone private and its new owner, Galen Weston, has axed the expansion plan that was Vittorio Radice's big idea. More than Debenhams, Selfridges was building up to be quite a threat. So sighs of relief at HoF, where few dispute that the arrival and upgrades of Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and John Lewis in its key territories, Manchester and Birmingham, has hit the tills. </p> <p>On the downside, debt remains beefy. There is always a gap between promises and reality (though it is understood that trade is respectable, with summer sales moderate and most stores 'clean' and ready for autumn stock). Rentals are another issue, having rocketed due to leases expiring. One central London store's rent has risen eighteenfold. The company has treated this as an excep tional, but the money has to come from somewhere. </p> <p>Investors hope HoF will increase dividends as the financial baggage is cleared. It is still in the market for acquisitions, though it would be unlikely to grab at Allders, say, unless the price plummeted, because it would not want many of the sites. An alternative scenario is that Hunter, HoF's major shareholder, or Icelandic group Baugur, will decide they want to wrest control. Either way, House of Fraser is not a bad bet.</p> <p><strong> Billiton booms beyond China</strong></p> <p> While its former chief executive, Brian Gilbertson, heads for Russia with a reputed $50 million pay deal, mining and resources group BHP Billiton will give the City details of its own windfall. </p> <p>Formed by Gilbertson through merging BHP and Billiton in 2001, the group has responded to surging demand for commodities in China with production surges of its own across most of its products. Iron ore, copper, aluminium and diamond production have shown growth of at least 20 per cent over 2002 levels and analysts are expecting a 70 per cent hike in next week's year-end profits. </p> <p>But with growth in China expected to slow in the second half of the year, will the Anglo-Australian group continue to strike it big? The consensus is that it will. Mining watchers believe BHP will continue to run flat out, with demand for iron ore and coking coal likely to remain strong. Predictions are for volume increases into next year, along with strong prices. </p> <p>Most argue that mining stocks have fallen because of concerns that Chinese growth would falter. But although the need for commodities in the People's Republic may moderate, it will do so from such high levels that prices are likely to be supported for some time. As mining executives and sector analysts agree, if Chinese demand was not slowing, prices would be even higher. </p> <p>What distinguishes BHP from the rest of the sector is its oil exploration and production business, which contributed about 25 per cent of earnings at the half year. Output was disappointing, falling 15 per cent in June. However, the longer-term outlook is different. There was strong exploration data in the last quarter and three new projects received approval for development. </p> <p>Analysts believe that BHP has a strong spread of assets, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, and that there are prospects for growth over the next decade. Meanwhile, as spot prices continued to break records last week, oil futures markets pointed to crude prices staying on average over $30 a barrel for at least the next 10 years. </p> <p>BHP Billiton has had three years of profits growth. With commodity markets in general and crude oil in particular looking unlikely to fall back in the short term, there will probably be more to come.</p>",
  "<p> In the film Swimming Pool (2003), Charlotte Rampling plays an English crime writer who goes off to the south of France to work on a book. It is a good film for many reasons, but the scene I liked best was the writer's wordless and businesslike arrival at the house. Yes, she briskly checked out the view: trees, lawn, pool. Yes, she noted that there was a kitchen. But basically, from the moment she arrived, she cased the joint like a professional burglar, and I knew exactly why she was doing it. </p> <p>Narrowing her eyes, she selected an upstairs room, cleared a table of ornaments and dragged it to the window, sought and found an electric socket, drew a spaghetti of electric cables (with continental adapters) out of her hand luggage, placed her laptop on the table and opened it, stood back to admire the effect - and then, finally, exhaled for the first time. </p> <p>Watching her do this, I had mixed feelings. Part of me was quite taken aback: here was my arrival-at-holiday-home routine vividly enacted on screen - and, I have to say, it looked a bit peculiar and unpleasant. At the same time, I was simply relieved: good result with that electric socket, Charlotte! Both of us knew, you see, that things don't always work out that easily. </p> <p>Writing away from home is something I've done for about 10 years. When I worked as a television critic in the 1990s, I found that I couldn't write fiction at home, so I had the bright idea of renting a small place in Brighton for the purpose. It worked. For my second novel, I would decamp for a month at a time to the Isle of Wight with a carload of books and equipment. For my third novel, it was Dublin, which was less successful. I rented a flat near to Dublin Castle which seemed quite OK until I realised that, all day and all night, I could hear, very distinctly, an automatic garage door opening and closing. Du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du it went (up); then du-du-du-du-du-d u-du-du it went (down). Sometimes it would be halfway down (du-du-du-du-du), then reverse gears and go up again (du-du-du-du-du). </p> <p>As you can see, I became sensitised to this up-and-down activity, which I first assumed must be the knocking of pipes. I even phoned the owners to ask about the frightful du-du-du-du-du noise - but they disingenuously professed not to know what noise I was referring to. By the end of two weeks (I had booked for four), I was yelling at the unseen garage-users: 'Why can't you all come in and go out at the same time, you bastards?' At the end of three weeks, I went home. </p> <p>But my garage-door days are over, because I have found my ideal place, a Greek island in the Dodecanese. A bit obvious? Well, not to me. I was never a Greek-island kind of girl before and, in fact, my beloved Halki remains the only Greek island I know. A painting holiday first took me there in 2002 and I was struck immediately by two things: that it was the kind of place a woman could go by herself; and that it was laughably cheap and jolly compared with Dublin. </p> <p>I now spend up to 10 weeks a year in Halki, regard myself as a semi-resident, have many Halki-loving (and also Halki-dwelling) friends and get quite defensive when people refer to my visits as 'holiday'. The point is, I am very productive on my Greek island, perhaps because there are no media distractions. It's astonishing but true: during one four-week trip 18 months ago, I wrote two-and-a-half 30-minute radio drama scripts, plus a short story, a book review and an essay about the history of television. And I still came home with a tan. </p> <p>Halki is a 75-minute ferry-ride west from the nearest point on Rhodes - just too far to prevent day trippers from cluttering up the place. It has a harbour with tavernas, bars and small supermarkets, behind which a U-shaped town is ranged. Nice church; tall campanile; picturesque fishing boats on turquoise water; town hall clock permanently showing 25 past one; cocks crowing; cats sleeping; cerise bougainvillaea; bright stars at night. Pretty much your idea of a Greek island, really. </p> <p>It is not always dead quiet because of intermittent building work, but what I prize about Halki is that it has nothing to offer the sensation-seeker. There are no nightclubs, for a start; and the one small hotel stands empty for most of the year (it's run by the council), so all the tourists are in self-catering accommodation, mixed in with the Greeks. There is nowhere to hire a car or bike - and nowhere much to drive to, in any case. </p> <p>The one road on the island leads to a monastery, past an old ruined town with an old ruined castle above it. The only thrill is the earth-trembling arrival and departure of the large Athens-Rhodes ferries. Nearly all my snaps of Halki show the arrival or departure of the 'big boat', because I get so excited about it. My friends at home have stopped asking to look at them. </p> <p>My only concern about Halki is the way I can exist in this fabulous environment, sitting at my laptop, and not be inspired to write about it. Is it a terrible indictment? Because the thing is, when I'm in Halki, I don't write about Greek islands; I write ghost stories set in Cambridge or radio comedies set in the London hat business of the 1920s. Last year at about this time, I was mapping out a classic serial set in Highgate during the Second World War and sitting on my terrace making notes about the way Hampstead Heath was quarried in 1940 for sandbags. </p> <p>I wonder: is it good to be the kind of person who can sit at a window filled with the colours of the Aegean but still write a monologue set in the lingerie department of a big shop in Oxford Street? What does that say about the human brain? Oh well, ask Jonathan Miller; I don't know. </p> <p>Sometimes, of course, one fantasises about living in the sun permanently. Many writers have done it. All you need, apparently, is an old Panama hat, a Remington typewriter, a faithful companion-cum-servant who is willing to shop for exotic loaves and the ability to order strong drinks in the local lingo. I suspect, however, that my gender may be against the fulfilment of this Graham Greene idyll; besides, on Halki, I'd go nuts within a year. </p> <p>As it is, I must always make respite trips to the more cosmopolitan Rhodes during my stays in Halki so that I can - well, mainly so that I can buy a newspaper. Have you noticed how big things always happen when you're out of the country? I was in Halki when David Kelly died. My mum told me on the phone and I had no idea what to make of it. 'Why? How? But this is big !' I said, fruitlessly. I was in Halki, also, when I heard about the Madrid bombings and DBC Pierre winning the Booker prize. However, I was, for once, in the right place at the right time when Greece survived the first round of Euro 2004, so that was a definite consolation. </p> <p>I yearn for Halki and my chin always wobbles when I leave. I think the best aspect of it, for me, is the healthy indoors/outdoors ratio that the lifestyle there imposes. At home, I might work all day indoors and then stay indoors again in the evening. In Halki, this simply can't happen. I work indoors until one, then pack a beach bag and go for a swim, a sunbed snooze and an omelette at Nick's Taverna (possibly my favourite spot on earth). I come back again at about four, have a shower and another restorative lie-down, do a bit more work till about 7.30pm, then coat myself in mosquito repellent, put on a nice strappy frock and go out for dinner with my Halki mates. Sometimes I'm in, you see, but equally, sometimes I'm out. Oh, the glory of limited choice! </p> <p> And meanwhile, I do ask myself: would I rather be in the Aegean writing about Oxford Street or in Oxford Street writing about the Aegean? Well, just so long as that electric socket is in a convenient position, there is actually no contest. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong> Lynne Truss is the author of the worldwide bestseller Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves.

  "The government seems confused about HIV/Aids (News, last week). <p>On the one hand, Gordon Brown announced in his spending review that he was setting aside \u00a31.5 billion over the next three years to tackle the disease in the developing world; on the other, there are the NHS guidelines which, as reported on your front page, will stipulate that asylum seekers will not get treatment. </p> <p>So you get treated if you stay away or if you happen to be here already, but if you try to move from one to the other - even to escape torture - you get a death sentence. </p> <p>Which bit of the Bible did Tony find that one in?<br> <b>Bill Linton</b><br> Palmers Green, London N13 </p> <p>While left/liberal members of the medical profession and the 'chattering classes' may condemn this government's plan to deny refugees the very costly treatment for HIV and other lifestyle diseases on the NHS, a large proportion of Brits will ask why it has taken so long.<br> <b>Robert Tarplett</b><br> Birmingham </p> <p>I have been living with HIV for eight years, and have a beautiful negative five-year-old daughter.

  "<p>Google, the internet search company is gearing up for one of the most controversial mega-flotations in years. Ever since founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin unveiled their plans for an initial public offering (IPO) to take the company public back in April, the float has been mired in controversy. </p> <p>Analysts have been sceptical about the asking price of between $29 billion and $36bn and doubts have been expressed about the complex way the shares are being auctioned via the internet. Now the float might be delayed for a second time because an interview that Page and Brin gave to Playboy magazine could have breached Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines about what can be said out in the open prior to a public offer. </p> <p>I would be surprised if this IPO was cancelled altogether - barring a global stock market meltdown. There is too much pride riding on it and the auction process has gone too far. </p> <p>But assuming the IPO goes ahead, no one should be in any doubt that this flotation is rich in symbolism. It is by far the biggest technology IPO since the dotcom crash of 2000, and it will be a litmus test for the IPO market and investor confidence for the biggest economy in the world. </p> <p>Of course, the founders and Google's original investors will make many millions of dollars. So it is tempting to watch this spectacle and conclude that this is internet mania part two. But many things are different this time. Google makes profits, and its technology is more popular with consumers than was the case five years ago. But the success or otherwise of the IPO turns on two simple questions: is Google a good investment, and at what price? We are about to find out.</p> <p><strong>Why Royal Dutch Shell needs a Total makeover</strong></p> <p>No wonder Royal Dutch Shell fears a takeover approach from Total, its French rival (as we report on page one). The prospect of a merger is one sure way to get shares in the embattled oil giant moving again. Last week's disclosure that the company was prepared to reform its archaic boardroom structure had almost no effect on the price. It shows something dramatic is needed to revive confidence. </p> <p>The lack of enthusiasm is no longer linked with the scandal that broke at the beginning of the year, when Shell shocked investors by revealing it had overstated proven oil and gas reserves by 23 per cent. It is taken as read that the company will unveil corporate governance reforms in November, designed to improve accountability and transparency.</p> <p>Nor is the City up in arms about the \u00a32.6 million Shell is paying Walter van de Vijver, the former head of exploration who resigned at the height of the reserves crisis. Although it is yet another example of payment for failure, investors are more concerned about Shell's relatively weak position in exploration and production. Here, it is dwarfed by peers such as BP and Exxon Mobil.</p> <p>The problem turns on underinvestment. It will take time to boost production to levels enjoyed by more innovative rivals. A merger with Total would solve that problem in one fell swoop.</p> <p><strong>Hermes bust-up, but who replaces Watson?</strong></p> <p>It is nice to get one's teeth into a good old-fashioned City bust-up, especially in August, so I am grateful for the row at the fund manager Hermes, which, among others, manages the huge BT pension scheme. </p> <p>The problem is at the group's high-profile fund, Hermes Focus Asset Management. HFAM invests in underperforming companies, some with poor records of corporate governance; it then makes a nuisance of itself, hauling management over the coals and demanding reform.</p> <p>The tack has worked well and the fund has played a critical role in shaking up dozy managers, with rewarding results for shareholders. In the process, two of the fund's senior bosses, Peter Butler and Steve Brown, became extremely successful. The pair have been well remunerated, collecting more than \u00a32m apiece in 2003. They were apparently emboldened to demand greater independence. But chief executive Tony Watson and other directors said no, and now the pair have resigned. Perhaps they will set up a rival company and take some of their former associates with them.</p> <p>But so what? The dispute is a storm in a teacup, because HFAM's funds account for little more than 3 per cent of what Hermes has under management.</p> <p>A much more intriguing Hermes question is who will succeed Watson, perhaps in two years' time? The internal favourite is Nick Mustoe, chief investment officer, but Hermes may look outside. Tony Bolton, Fidelity's star fund manager, is retiring shortly. Might he be interested?</p> <p><strong>Cazenove awaits suitor</strong></p> <p>If memory serves me correctly, blue-chip City stockbroker Cazenove, which has been in sale talks with several international investment banks over the past year, said recently that, by the holidays, it would be able to update us on its 'future'. Well, it's mid-August and still no word from the financiers, which I reckon means one of two things. A bid could be unveiled shortly. Or, chairman David Mayhew and his lieutenants are enjoying the Tuscany sunshine, having tried to sell the business, but failed to agree a price with any of the suitors - such as Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan, all of which were rumoured to be in the frame. </p> <p>If that is the case, what now? Mayhew, who is in his early sixties, probably wants to retire, but as the driving force behind the firm, he can't possibly leave before Cazenove's future is settled. Mayhew talked of a possible flotation three years ago when Cazenove was valued at about \u00a31 billion; today the price tag is around \u00a3650m. But a float now seems unlikely; Mayhew is far too shrewd an operator to wing it in volatile market conditions like these.</p> <p>My advice to him is: retain Cazenove's independence, name a credible successor, then set a date for departure. However, something tells me Mayhew wants to go out with a bang, and that means a deal. If possible.</p>",
  "<p>WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell will this week cheer investors by unveiling record figures at the group.</p> <p>Analysts are likely to seize on the group's half-year results as the first evidence that the prolonged advertising recession is finally over. They expect WPP, the world's second-largest advertising company, to post underlying pre-tax profits of around \u00a3230 million, up 15 per cent on the same period last year. </p> <p> Interim revenues will top \u00a32 billion for the first time. Industry analysts will search Sorrell's comments for clues about the strength of the advertising recovery follow ing one of the most severe downturns in living memory. He is likely to confirm that the Olympics, which opened in Athens on Friday, the ongoing American presidential election campaign and the Euro 2004 football tournament have all boosted spending significantly. </p> <p>Current trading is believed to be buoyant. The results 'will be an opportunity for WPP to be a bit more upbeat. The numbers haven't really been changing, but now it's looking better for them. Revenue growth is going to come through,' said one analyst. </p> <p>Sorrell will also be asked whether WPP will bid for Grey Global, the independent Amer ican advertising company that has been put up for sale by its founder and controlling shareholder, Ed Meyer. WPP is examining Grey's books and could bid within weeks. </p> <p>The company is valued at around \u00a3700m, but WPP faces competition from French rival Havas and several American financial buyers. Some analysts have expressed concerns about a bid for Grey. 'There will always be an integration risk' said one. 'There will be potential client conflicts to manage.' Consumer giant Procter &amp; Gamble is a Grey client and its fierce rival Unilever has a long-standing relationship with WPP.</p>",
  "<p>Am I alone in detecting a whiff of smugness in our cool British air? Talking to other business people in Britain, I sense an implicit swelling of pride in our goodish financial performance as old rivals like Germany struggle with high unemployment and a wheezing economy. </p> <p>Time to be careful, I suggest. Smugness is first cousin of hubris, which is always followed by ruin. </p> <p>Why am I so gloomy? Because I believe there is a fault line in our national psyche that could have fatal effects on our prosperity. That fault line is a very British belief that the world of ideas is peripheral to our commercial success, whereas I think it is central. </p> <p>Here's an example - when I saw a Sony Walkman for the first time in the Seventies, Britain's Rank Bush Murphy was a major force in home electronics. Since then Sony has embraced the world of ideas and prospered. Look at us, in contrast. </p> <p>Kenneth Grange, the great British product designer, told me once that he loved to work in Japan because they saw real commercial value in great design. It is not uncommon for a big Japanese corporation to have a design director on the main board. Now try imagining that here. </p> <p>A generation after the Walkman, the new must-have music product is the iPod - a brilliantly fresh design idea that has captured everyone's imagination. This breakthrough product has dramatically reversed the fortunes of Apple, which suddenly has something even Microsoft's Bill Gates hasn't got. The iPod is of course the work of a young British designer (Jonathan Ive), but he is working for an American company because it understands that great design can inspire commercial success. </p> <p>Deep in the darkest corners of the English preoccupation with class is a belief that designing and making things is blue-collar stuff, not white collar. We even show our disdain for manufactured products by calling them all 'widgets' as if to identify them correctly would take us too close to the coal face. Nice middle-class boys become accountants, lawyers or bankers. There's nothing wrong with the professions but a nation needs to do more than advise - it has to create, too. </p> <p>The irony is that we are world leaders in creating. British advertising agencies are as good as you can find. Ridley Scott, Alan Parker and Anthony Minghella are among the best film directors. The Pompidou centre in Paris was designed by British architect Richard Rogers (with Italy's Renzo Piano) and built by the British firm Ove Arup.</p> <p>Most ironic of all, the vehicle that revolutionised the way we think about the car was the Mini, a great British design. And who is making a fortune with the new version? Yes, that grand old British company, BMW.</p> <p>We have the creative talent, we have the design imagination, but we do not have the belief that such talent should be at the heart of a business. I ran a check on which areas the chief executives of the FTSE 100 companies came from and found that 26 per cent had been finance men or women and 29 per cent had been operational managers. How many had been marketing heads? A grand total of 6 per cent. </p> <p>If we really believe in the power of good ideas to excite the customer, then marketing would be a valued discipline that would lead to the top job. But it didn't in 94 per cent of the top 100 British companies. Before you say most marketing directors just aren't good enough for the top, isn't that the point? In a country where marketing is undervalued, no wonder it doesn't attract the best people. In our strange class culture, marketing is below the salt. </p> <p>It's a prejudice we breed early. Lots of people want to read media studies at university. It's the study of how mass communication works. Not a bad start for a life in business, you might think. but media studies is widely dismissed by the great and the good as not a 'proper' subject. Victorian novels good, modern films bad is the defining ethos. In the United States, 30 per cent of the workforce is employed in some kind of creative industry, whether it be film, TV, music or journalism and so on. I wonder if they sneer at media studies there? </p> <p>I started by asking if our smugness at the expense of, among others, the Germans was wise. I touched on the fate of the Mini, now in German hands. BMW also owns Rolls-Royce and Bentley is part of Volkswagen. Meanwhile, Ford of America has snapped up Jaguar and Land-Rover. Their cultures understand the value of a brand. </p> <p>Meanwhile, our great designers and creative thinkers are facing an ungracious reception at the tradesmen's entrance. Or they are getting out their passports to go to a place where they'll be welcome at the main gates? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roger Mavity is chairman of the marketing and public relations firm Citigate Dewe Rogerson.</p>",
  "<p>A reason - some would say the major reason - why economics is not a science is the impossibility of conducting repeated experiments under controlled conditions. Unlike the pure scientists, the argument runs, economists have to rely on inference from episodes that are never wholly comparable. </p> <p>That is true up to a point, although it is possible to overstate the case. In some important areas of science - deep space for example - experimentation is as difficult as in economics and, accordingly, the rule of inference looms large. Furthermore, experiments are conducted in economics from time to time, even if the policymakers would deny the charge, claiming that they are operating within the bounds of received wisdom. </p> <p>One of the most arresting of such economic policy experiments is being undertaken by policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic. This involves the almost diametrically opposite ways in which the two biggest economic areas in the world - the United States and the euro area - have reacted to the slowing of their economies following the end of the Nineties' hi-tech investment boom. The US reacted with massive economic stimulus: the euro area, by contrast, opted for extreme steadiness. The numbers make a fascinating study. </p> <p>As the US economy slowed in 2002, the US treasury boosted aggregate demand through tax cuts and expenditure increases by nearly 2.5 percentage points of GDP. And the Fed eased monetary policy too, stimulating aggregate expenditure by an additional 2.5 percentage points. The resulting overall 5 per cent-odd of GDP shock from the policy defibrillator was massive - the largest of the past 50 years. Then, in 2003, US policymakers administered an additional 2.5 point stimulus </p> <p>Policymakers in the euro area, by contrast, took almost no stimulative action. In 2002, monetary policy was eased only slightly, stimulating the EU economy by a mere quarter of a percentage point or so. In 2003 monetary policy was eased again, and there was a modest fiscal expansion, but together the two provided an overall stimulus of less than 1 percentage point of GDP. America's stimulus was thus about $640 billion larger than Europe's. </p> <p>The reasons for these sharply divergent policy responses are deep - cultural and even philosophical. The US exhibits the conviction that if something does not work out right, you fix it. Europe, by contrast, is apt to view some elements in life as having a certain inevitability. As the economy slows, political pressures on European policymakers build more slowly, and with less intensity than in the US, where a President is held to account for the performance of the US economy quarter by quarter. </p> <p>America's business is business, and the media and the pollsters never let the President forget it. Indeed, the accountability gets ever more short-term. Ex-US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently described how President Bush urged him to improve the monitoring of the US economy, not on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but month by month, so that immediate policy action could be taken at the very first sign of a slowdown. </p> <p>This philosophical difference of approach between Europeans and the Americans is not new. For at least the past 30 years, successive US secretaries of the treasury have been critical of the way that European countries have conducted their economic policy. The US complaint is twofold. First, they claim that European countries - and most notably Germany - are too preoccupied with inflation: that the moment that it starts to accelerate, the Europeans stamp on it by taking policy action to slow the economy. When Europeans retort that they know better than does any American the danger - economic, social, and political - that can flow from excessive inflation, the Americans make their second argument. If inflation is such a concern, they say, the right way to deal with it is to have a flexible, adaptable economy that can shake inflation out of itself with only a brief slowdown. Europe's labour-cosseting, socially overprotective, adjustment-stultifying policies, by contrast, mean that inflation, once in the system, can be eradicated only through protracted and costly recession. </p> <p>Hence the difference in approach. US governments, regardless of political hue, barrel down the back straight, foot to the floor, braking only at the last moment before the corner. Once through the corner - if they do not leave the track - the accelerator goes back to the floor. In Europe, by contrast, the approach down the back straight is more sedate, the corner is taken smoothly, and the acceleration out is less sharp. The $640bn question is, of course, which method of driving the economy wins the race. </p> <p>Certainly the US policy stimulus achieved its immediate purpose: it staved off recession. But it also took the federal budget from a surplus of about 2 per cent of GDP to its present 4.5 per cent deficit, the biggest swing since the Second World War. It also put the US current account of the balance of payments, which at the start of every previous recovery since 1949 has been approximately in balance, in deficit to the tune of 5 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, incredibly easy monetary policy, in fuelling the auto and housing boom, has resulted in consumers and households taking on unprecedented levels of debt in relation to income. The worries from all this are threefold: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> that investors, worried by the US budget deficit, will start to push bond yields back up to their Eighties levels; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> that the dollar will slide further vis-\u00e0-vis other currencies as it did in the mid-Eighties, bringing inflation back into the US economy; and </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> that households and consumers will find themselves in trouble when the Fed becomes obliged to hike rates to combat the falling dollar and rising inflation. </p> <p>The worry about Europe, by contrast, is that it simply may never get a proper recovery started. It may be that steadiness of policy begets confidence; that confidence begets expenditure; and that that expenditure induces further expenditure, particularly by businesses. </p> <p>But it could also be that slow growth becomes self-perpetuating. If businesses judge that consumers are going to be cautious with their expenditure, saving more for their old age as they face an uncertain pension future, then businesses in turn will be cautious themselves about laying down new capacity, for fear that it will lie unused. Thus the US has opted for growth, even if it comes at the expense of stability: and the Europeans for stability, even if at the expense of growth. So far, the evidence as to which is the better driving style is unclear, for the experiment has not yet run its course. It will be next year, at the earliest, before the evidence starts to come in. What may well prove to be a drama is yet to play out. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Llewellyn, a former chief economic forecaster at the OECD in Paris, is the global chief economist at Lehman Brothers.
