  "<p>The world's financial system is in better shape than at any time since the pricking of the dotcom bubble and the September 11 terrorist attacks threw global markets into turmoil, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday. </p> <p>In an upbeat assessment of recent trends, the fund said it would take a major and long-lasting shock to upset a financial system now capable of riding out the collapse of a hedge fund or even a leading bank. </p> <p>The IMF said it would step up its monitoring of the exposure of the financial sector to the volatile energy market, in which oil prices rose to nearly $50 a barrel last month, but that the biggest current threat was complacency. </p> <p>\"While it is obviously feasible that one or the other financial institution, such as a hedge fund or even a bank, might succumb to serious mistakes in risk management or to outright fraud, such incidents should be isolated cases with limited, if any, contagion to the system as a whole,\" the IMF said in its global financial stability report. </p> <p>Balance sheets had been strengthened, the report said, with a \"paradigm shift\" in risk management, particularly among the biggest multinational banks. \"Short of a major and devastating geopolitical incident or a terrorist attack undermining, in a significant and lasting way, consumer confidence ... it is hard to see where systemic threats could come from in the short term.\" </p> <p>Given that markets had responded calmly to the increase in interest rates in the US and other parts of the developed world, the report added: \"The most immediate risk is that market participants may develop a sense of complacency.\" Low levels of volatility in bond and stock markets might lead to a return of indiscriminate risk behaviour, thanks to a tendency to \"search for yield\". </p> <p>The IMF said an additional risk would be if US interest rates were to rise more quickly than anticipated. \"This would be especially true if the markets were to perceive monetary policy as having fallen behind the curve and needing to catch up.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The price of crude oil fell yesterday in New York despite US data showing a reduction in stock levels. Opec announced it would raise production by 1m barrels a day to 27m but this had little effect on markets as the cartel has already been pumping above this level. Traders also shrugged off the effect of Hurricane Ivan, which forced 60% of US Gulf offshore to close.</p> <p>Analysts put in fall in October crude prices, down 81 cents to $43.58 a barrel in New York, down to profit taking.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?14@86.5saMbwZ81Sr.0@.4a911591\">Talk about bad science here</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It's hard to know who to trust these days, what with pseudoscientists pretending to have all kinds of qualifications and quoting authorities all over the shop. Susan Clark's consistently entertaining \"What's The Alternative?\" column in the Sunday Times recommends artemisinin this week, as an alternative herbal malaria prophylaxis for someone travelling to Asia. \"The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria is funding the shift to artemisinin-based combination therapies in 26 countries,\" she says. Sounds good. I'll do you a favour, and spare you the rant about how chloroquine costs 20 cents per treatment while fashionable ideas like artemisinin cost $2.40, and stick to more important facts. Like: artemisinin is a treatment for malaria, not a preventive measure, because its half-life is too short, and the excellent and sensible Global Fund does not recommend it as a prophylaxis, nor does it endorse anything, as it is just a funding body. Perhaps Susan Clark can't tell the difference. Here's hoping her readers are a bit more cautious. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> So who do you trust? What about a \"consultant podiatric surgeon\"? Sounds a bit like \"consultant orthopaedic surgeon\", doesn't it? Or \"consultant vascular surgeon\"? Except a consultant podiatric surgeon is just a chiropodist who has decided to charge a bit more. Nice move, but it's hard to prove that the public have been misled here. Sorry, I mean to say they have \"misunderstood\" the innocent phonetic coincidence between \"consultant orthopaedic surgeon\" and \"consultant podiatric surgeon\". So the British Orthopaedic Trainees Association has surveyed 262 members of the public, and what do you know: 95% thought that consultant podiatric surgeons had qualified as doctors, while only 9.5% thought chiropodists were doctors. Ker-ching. Mind you, 97.3% thought consultant orthopaedic surgeons had been to medical school, and even a few junior doctors got the answers wrong. In a world full of \"Dr Gillian McKeith PhDs\", until the government starts protecting professional titles, and regulating all the people who have popped up to make money out of our obsession with health, I can't start to think about the financial gain for these wily characters because (holds head sanctimoniously aloft), there are actually rather serious issues about what goes through the heads of people who think they're giving informed consent to treatment by self-appointed professionals. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Citigroup appeared to concede it had breached City rules yesterday when a senior executive expressed his regrets about an unprecedented \u00a37bn European bond trade last month.</p> <p>The world's biggest bond broking firm is being investigated by the Financial Services Authority and other European regulators for the trade which took place on August 2 and left many of Citigroup's largest rivals nursing heavy losses.</p> <p>In a memo to employees, Tom Maheras, head of global capital markets, admitted the firm should not have done the deal, which is rumoured to have made \u20ac12m (\u00a37m) profits for Citigroup.</p> <p>\"We did not meet our standards in this instance and, as a result, we regret having executed this transaction. Unfortunately we failed to consider fully its impact on our clients, our market participants and our regulators,\" Mr Maheras said.</p> <p>Citigroup refused to elaborate on the lengthy memo which was leaked yesterday while Spiros Skordos, the bond trader who is believed to have executed the trade, refused to comment.</p> <p>The controversial transaction involved the sale of \u20ac11bn of bonds in a number of tranches in two minutes through the EuroMTS electronic trading system. The sheer size of the transaction pushed down the overall price of bonds and Citigroup then bought back \u20ac4bn at the lower prices, making a profit.</p> <p>In so doing, many of Citigroup's rivals believe it broke an informal agreement not to place large orders into the EuroMTS system, which temporarily placed restrictions on the size of orders that could be placed.</p> <p>When Citigroup placed the stream of sell orders into the system it knew they would be filled by its rivals who would be forced to agree to buy them because of the EuroMTS rules.</p> <p>There is speculation that Citigroup sold the large volume of bonds on the back of a sell order from a client and that some European governments had been so concerned about the action of the US bank that they were considering removing their business.</p> <p>In the memo, Mr Maheras told employees that \"we need to be sure that in whatever we do we fully consider the impact of our actions on our clients and the markets. We must exercise sound judgment, know our markets and our clients well and act in their best interests\".</p> <p>\"This is critical to our reputation, and therefore to our ability to be successful over the long term,\" he added.</p> <p>He said the investigation by the FSA and other European regulators was continuing and pledged to update staff about the outcome when he could.</p> <p>The FSA refused to give details of the investigation into Citigroup, which was first announced a month ago when it made clear it was not just looking for specific breaches of its rules, but more generally at the consequences of Citigroup's actions on financial markets.</p> <p>The internal memo was leaked as Citigroup was found to have broken rules on the placement of securities by the Japanese securities exchange surveillance commission.</p> <p>Citigroup - along with many Wall Street firms - has spent much of the past two years trying to restore its reputation after settling claims by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer and US regulator the securities and exchange commission that it had used its research arm to gain investment banking business.</p> <p>It has also made one of the largest ever out-of-court payments to settle claims by investors in telecoms company WorldCom that it took part in a huge financial fraud.</p> <p><strong>Memo</strong></p> <p><strong>To:</strong> All Global Corporate and Investment Banking employees</p> <p><strong>From:</strong> Tom Maheras, head of global capital markets, GCIB Subject Recent European Government Bond Trades</p> <p><strong>What he said: </strong>In August, our European government bond trading desk executed an innovative transaction that sought to access the liquidity in the European government bond markets. This transaction, which involved large executions in various European government bonds and futures contracts, has attracted the attention of the media and regulatory authorities.</p> <p><strong>What he meant: </strong>While I was on summer vacation, one of our star (albeit maverick) bond traders executed a huge and highly technical trade, which had the effect of clipping about \u00a37m of profits from some of our best customers across Europe. The trader was too smart by half; in the process he has made a number of important clients, including a number of continental governments, look like idiots. We stand accused of bringing the markets into disrepute and - surprise, surprise - the regulators are all over us.</p> <p><strong>What he said: </strong>As an industry leader, Citigroup is committed to holding itself to the highest standards in its business practices. We believe that our employees understand that, and as a matter of course, act accordingly. However, we did not meet our standards in this instance and, as a result, we regret having executed this transaction. Unfortunately, we failed to fully consider its impact on our clients, other market participants, and our regulators.</p> <p><strong>What he meant: </strong>We're a big bank, with a huge reputation and we have a long way to fall. We can never be publicly seen to abuse our power.</p> <p><strong>What he said: </strong>A willingness to commit capital to the markets and our clients and thinking creatively are qualities that we value in our employees and that have been important factors in our success. However, we need to be sure that in whatever we do, we fully consider the impact of our actions on our clients and the markets. We must exercise sound judgment, know our markets and our clients well and act in their best interests. This is critical to our reputation, and therefore to our ability to be successful over the long term.</p> <p><strong>What he meant: </strong>Let me put that more starkly: we're a big, fat target.</p> <p><strong>What he said: </strong>We strongly support liquid and transparent markets and will continue to be a major provider of capital and liquidity. We will continue to innovate and use that innovation to help our clients achieve their objectives. Most importantly, we remain committed to conducting our business in accordance with the highest standards. We need to consult and communicate regularly with each other and with our colleagues in the legal, compliance and risk organisations. If you have questions or doubts, talk to them and your manager.</p> <p><strong>What he meant: </strong>We want to stay in the business of investment banking, but we can only do so if we stay on the right side of the law. And that's an individual responsibility. The law is complex, so if you don't understand it, consult someone who does.</p> <p><strong>What he said: </strong>The UK's Financial Services Authority and other European regulators are investigating this transaction and we are fully cooperating. When we are able to share with you the outcome of this investigation, we will.</p> <p><strong>What he meant: </strong>This affair is probably going to cost us dear - unless, of course, the regulators find they can't quite work out whether we have actually done anything wrong. On that front, we're keeping our fingers crossed.</p> <p><strong>What he said: </strong>Let's continue to work together to ensure that our collective integrity, expertise, and commitment to our clients and to sound and well-functioning markets drive our every action and business decision.</p> <p><strong>What he meant: </strong>So just keep your heads down.</p>",
  "There's the Corlette Circle and the Marshall Heights, Lincoln Housing and New York Town Village - little bits of middle America that have put down roots in southern Germany. The diners, baseball diamonds, shopping malls and station wagon car-dealerships have been here in northern Bavaria as long as anyone can remember. <p>For miles around, every small town and village is home to dozens of American soldiers, their partners and children - who board 60 buses every morning to go to their American-style schools on the sprawling military encampment occupying 128 hectares (320 acres) of prime land in the centre of this town of 130,000. </p> <p>\"The Americans and the Germans just grew up together here,\" said Ole Kruse, a W\u00fcrzburg city official. \"It's a very long tradition. The Americans are just part of this place.\" </p> <p>But not for much longer. Under the Pentagon's plans to reconfigure the US military's \"global posture\", the days of the GIs in Germany are numbered. W\u00fcrz-burg and a string of nearby towns, home to the 13,000-strong 1st Infantry Division, will be hardest hit. </p> <p>The division is halfway through a 12-month deployment in Iraq, in the Sunni triangle north of Baghdad. Many of the station wagons and SUVs that clog the streets of W\u00fcrzburg have yellow ribbons on their bonnets, testament to the presence of loved ones in Iraq. At the large US military hospital, the Stars and Stripes is permanently at half mast to mourn the dead. </p> <p>W\u00fcrzburg is also in mourning of sorts. \"We're talking to the Americans about the what, where, when and how,\" said Mr Kruse. \"Will it be a full or partial pullout? The Americans still have not said what is happening to us.\" </p> <p>The fear here is that the soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division will return from Iraq merely to pack up and go back to Kansas, leaving behind a lot of local unemployment, a collapsed property market, a hole in the regional economy and increased transatlantic estrangement between the two countries. </p> <p>\"This could be a big strategic disaster,\" said Thomas Leuerer, a W\u00fcrzburg academic who has spent years studying the post-second world war US military communities in Germany. </p> <p>\"The 1st Infantry and the 1st Armoured [based at Wiesbaden] are the last two heavy US divisions in Europe,\" he said. \"Their departure could wreck Nato. They give a feeling of security here. People think that as long as they are here, the Americans will fight for us and with us.\" </p> <p>But the US has other wars to fight, and Europe is receding as a focus. Half the 400 American military facilities in Europe are to be mothballed, and about half the troops recalled. Germany, where 75% of the total number of troops in Europe are stationed, is the main target of the cuts. The soldiers bring with them 100,000 family members and dependents. The impact of their departure on small-town Germany will be immense. </p> <p>In Kitzingen, east of W\u00fcrzburg, there have been times in recent years when the American population equalled the German one. In Baumholder, to the west, there are three Americans for every German. In Schweinfurt, to the north, the departure of thousands of people will have a severe effect on a depressed economy. </p> <p>The Americans invest about \u20ac40m (\u00a327m) in the region every year, and spend much more. The Verdi trade union believes the pullout will cost 80,000 German jobs in a country with stubbornly high unemployment of 4.5 million. </p> <p>American troops have been in W\u00fcrzburg for two generations, continuously since 1946, part of the contingent stationed in Germany since the end of the second world war. And very early on, the top brass decided that the best way to maintain order and morale was to send the families, too. </p> <p>That practice produced thriving communities. At the sprawling Leighton barracks in W\u00fcrzburg, headquarters to the 1st Infantry, the yellow-jerseyed teenagers of the W\u00fcrzburg Wolves American football squad are being put through their paces as their parents take their trolleys through the vast shopping mall and food hall. Subsidised by the Pentagon and trading in dollars, it is the biggest American shopping mall in Europe, a magnet for US families from all over southern Germany. </p> <p>\"It's nice to have a bit of home when you are away from home,\" said Sergeant Rebecca Sharpton, from the mid-west. </p> <p>Under the new plans these big bases are to be replaced by \"bare bones\" facilities scattered from eastern Europe to the far east. In future, US troops stationed overseas will leave their families behind. </p> <p>\"It will tear apart the lives of the soldiers,\" said Jim Wagner, a car salesman from Florida who has been in W\u00fcrzburg for seven years, doing brisk business from his showroom outside the US headquarters. \"It's a quality of life thing. You'll lose a lot of good people. As long as they are here, I can make a living. I can go anywhere the troops are. But I love Germany.\" </p> <p>As do many of the American troops. In W\u00fcrzburg around 40 Americans marry Germans every year, and hundreds of retired troops have opted to stay. </p> <p>If a decade ago the German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, paid the Kremlin billions to get the Russian army out of eastern Germany, the Germans would now happily pay the Americans to stay. But the decisions have been taken in Washington. </p> <p>\"Some think it's a punishment for us for being against the Iraq war,\" said Mr Kruse. \"But most think it's just America restructuring its forces. You can't ask the Americans to stay forever. They've done their job.\"</p>",
  "<p>We must assume that Tom Maheras, the name at the top of the extraordinary memorandum from Citigroup on its summer antics in the bond markets, expected his words of contrition to leak. </p> <p>He cannot have expected absolute, uniform loyalty among the many thousands employed by \"Global Corporate and Investment Banking\", even if it is the all-powerful Citigroup. </p> <p>In which case we should treat this memo as a public apology - a full admission that the bank's casual manipulation of the markets was wrong. </p> <p>It is also an admission of astonishing incompetence. Consider the bald facts: one morning in early August a Citigroup trader, Spiros Skordos, was able to play around with about \u00a37bn of the bank's money while seemingly ignoring the \"impact on our clients, other market participants and our regulators\". </p> <p>To put that in some sort of context, it was the equivalent of a bank selling BSkyB and then buying the business back a couple of minutes later and booking a profit of about 0.1%, or \u00a37m, in the process. </p> <p>Citigroup is the product of too many banking mergers to mention. While falling well short of monopoly status, its sheer size means it wields astonishing financial power. It dwarfs almost all its clients. The unregulated trading it conducts with clients and counterparties of all shapes and sizes, known as over-the-counter business, is far bigger than any formal stock, bond or commodity exchange on the planet. </p> <p>But it is still reliant on its reputation. After its battles with Eliot Spitzer on Wall Street, Enron, WorldCom, yesterday's run-in with Japanese regulators and now Mr Skordos' antics, that reputation is looking rather tarnished. </p> <p><strong> On the fence </strong><br> </p> <p> At first hearing, Steve Nickell's speech on the housing market yesterday sounded typical of a two-handed economist: on the one hand, house prices could fall; on the other, they might not. </p> <p>Small wonder that former American president Harry S Truman famously begged for a one-handed economist who might actually tell him what would happen instead of forever sitting on the fence. But in the long tradition of trying to tease meaning from the oblique language of central bankers, we reckon Professor Nickell, one of the key members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, was actually being rather clear. </p> <p>Mark his words: there is a \"significant probability\" that house prices will fall while it remains only \"quite possible\" that they would not. For a two-handed economist, that's a pretty straightforward statement. </p> <p>This is a strong echo of Bank of England governor Mervyn King's warning on house prices back in June - and the language in which it is couched simply highlights the Bank's dilemma. </p> <p>If Nickell et al are too aggressive in warning that house prices might crash, crash, they almost certainly will. And yet the monetary policy committee simply cannot stand by while a market bubble grows to increasingly dangerous proportions. </p> <p>They may or may not succeed in engineering the much hoped for \"soft landing\". But in the meantime these direct forays into the market can only be causing angst across town at HM Treasury. </p> <p>With an election looming, house price jitters are the last thing the chancellor needs. </p> <p><strong> F-brand values </strong><br> </p> <p> So is FCUK fcuked? Yesterday, French Connection, which until recently represented the nearest the high street had to an edgy yet mass market brand, revealed a 60% decline in operating profit at its UK shops and like-for-like sales down 9.5% - when they were roaring ahead by 11% same time last year. </p> <p>Founder, chairman and 42% shareholder Stephen Marks insists there is nothing wrong with the brand and that the dismal summer was to blame. That would be the same summer that left Next almost completely unscathed, we take it ... </p> <p>Until recently FCUK was just a riot. Judges expelling jurors sporting the brand on their t-shirts, banned TV ads, tabloid columnists railing against the obscenity of the F-brand. Mr Marks was in heaven. </p> <p>Now, however, the entire concept is looking a little F-rayed. The four letters are being dropped from new ads. Drapers Record, the bible of fashion retail, has described it as a \"tired and tacky\" label. </p> <p>Brand consultants are lining up to say it is now about as cool as Aled Jones. </p> <p>History is littered with once hot labels which swiftly turned old and cold. </p> <p>Think fashion (Joe Bloggs, Benetton), food (Blue Nun, Ferrero Rocher), music (Capital Radio, New Kids on the Block) or publishing (The Face) - life is just littered with must-have names that are suddenly just plain pants. </p> <p>Frankly, we are not surprised that the demise has started this summer. Mr Marks sold a sackful of shares - to finance his divorce - back in June, and it has been downhill ever since for the share price. </p> <p>The shares he sold for \u00a336m are now worth \u00a328m. </p> <p>He obviously remains confident his brand is just suffering a blip, but it is just uncanny how these things coincide.</p>",
  "<p>\"And they're off,\" said the ranger, as dozens of turtle hatchlings clambered over each other, propelling their tiny shells down the moonlit beach and into the ocean as though their lives depended on it. And they did. \"It's a sad fact,\" he explained, \"that only one in a 1,000 of these baby turtles will make it to adulthood.\"</p> <p>Those hatchlings momentarily disorientated were guided on their way by a beam of light from torches held by the children in our group. A couple of weaklings, too tired to make the 20m down the shore, were given a helping hand by the ranger and in only 15 minutes the miniature creatures had disappeared into the Pacific Ocean, leaving behind a cluster of broken eggshells.</p> <p>We were standing on Mon Repos beach. By day, a sweeping bay of squeaky amber sand, a secluded spot for locals to sunbathe, surf and fish. By night, home to the largest concentration of endangered marine turtles on the eastern Australian mainland. Between November and March access to the area is restricted and rangers patrol the beach for signs of nesting and hatching.</p> <p>It was 10.30pm and 22C as we sat under the neck-achingly clear night sky in the rookery's open-air amphitheatre. Our guide, who had worked in the conservation park for 20 years, explained the threats posed to the endangered creatures we were about to see. \"Turtles are rare and you may not see any hatchlings tonight.\" The audience sighed with disappointment. \"You could even be here for hours, but it's worth the wait. These creatures may be extinct within a generation.\"</p> <p>Marine turtles have struggled to survive in the modern environment. Caught in fishing nets, propellers and hunted illegally, as well as having to avoid the usual predators such as sharks, they have little chance of survival, especially as they do not reach maturity until they are between 30 and 50 years old. There are only a few large nesting populations of the green, hawksbill and loggerhead turtles left in the world. Conservation depends on detailed research, tagging and tracking and on protecting breeding environments such as Mon Repos.</p> <p>Fortunately we only had to wait half an hour before we were summoned to the beach. By the time our hushed group reached the nest, the first loggerheads had burrowed through the sand, closely followed by a fountain of their brothers and sisters. It was an astonishing sight as the small creatures, barely two minutes old, raced instinctively to the sea. If they survive the same hatchlings will return in 50 years' time to lay eggs on the very beach where they first emerged.</p> <p>I was now fascinated (and somewhat obsessed) by turtles and wanted to see the adults in their natural environment. To continue our marine safari, we headed north up the Queensland coast to the Capricorn and Bunker islands, in the southernmost part of the Great Barrier Reef national park. Less visited than the Whitsundays, most of the islands in this group are uninhabited and a rife breeding ground for many different species of marine turtles. </p> <p>We'd heard that Lady Musgrave island was a good bet for spotting turtles, and took a day trip to its coral cay. After a stomach-turning journey, our boat finally moored in the calm waters of the lagoon. Stepping onto the tiny tropical island was not the castaway experience I had imagined: the intense heat simmers off the crushed coral sand and the glare makes you squint and retreat thankfully into the turquoise water. </p> <p>The huge circle of coral wall that protects the lagoon means that the reef is exceptionally well preserved and flourishing here. In an afternoon of snorkelling, we spotted Nemo-like clown fish, speckled parrot fish and black and white sargeant majors, all flickering in the coral, without a care for the forty-odd humans who have joined them in the cay. </p> <p>It was a good time to visit the Capricorn group: further north, the Queensland coast is infested with jellyfish from November to April and it's not advisable to swim in the waters north of Rockhampton without a stinger suit. Snorkelling is significantly less enjoyable when you are head to toe in a pair of tights and in danger of a lethal sting from the silvery, almost translucent tentacles of box jellyfish; here we could jump fearlessly off the boat straight into a shoal of colourful fish.</p> <p>After about an hour of happily bobbing above the reef, I found myself face to face with an adult green turtle. Curious to see what was going on, it glided over and hovered at arm's-length, just enough time for me to gulp several mouthfuls of seawater and flood my snorkel in my attempts to catch my boyfriend's attention without distracting the prehistoric giant. We swam above it for a while, its tessellated shell a hand's stretch away in the clear water, its flippers the size of my arm. </p> <p>As the tide went out, more of the coral was revealed in the cay and it was possible to go deeper, even without actually diving. However, even spotting a white-tipped reef shark and a moray eel (slightly alarming when we discovered later it will lunge at anything for a spot of lunch) in the afternoon's snorkelling session, did not match up to the elation of swimming with the magnificent turtle. </p> <p>Heading north to the Whitsunday islands, the marine creatures were to make more appearances throughout the rest of our trip. Sometimes small ones would swim alongside the boat or an adult would bob up out of curiosity in the calm tropical waters.</p> <p>Visitors to the Great Barrier Reef often fly directly to the island resorts of the Whitsundays and miss spots like the secluded Mon Repos and the abundant wildlife of the lower Capricorn group. With the ever increasing threat of extinction, now is the time to see the turtles in the wild before they disappear. </p> <p> <strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The nesting season is from mid-November to February. The best time to see hatchling turtles is at night from mid-January until late March. Adult turtles can be seen in the waters of the tropic of Capricorn all year round.</p> <p>The rookery at <a href=\"http://www.australia.com/places_to_go/beach_coast_and_reef/beach_sunshine_coast/activities/productintercept.aust?jsessionid=am20g5ei!750632139!serv4ip!7551!7002&amp;p=9023876&amp;l=en&amp;c=au&amp;z=1512980926\">Mon Repos</a> has a visitor centre with an excellent exhibition.

Earlier, the prospect of a bidding war for Abbey fizzled out when HBOS, which had been widely tipped to make a rival offer for Britain's sixth biggest bank by assets, said it would be better off without a merger.</p> <p>\"Notwithstanding the very substantial opportunity to create synergies and a strong competition case with which to engage the regulators, HBOS has decided not to proceed with an offer for Abbey,\" the bank said in a statement. </p> <p>\"HBOS believes that the shareholder value inherent in its existing prospects is superior to that likely to be achieved through this combination.\" </p> <p>Last month HBOS expressed an interest in bidding for Abbey, a move that would have given the two about 35% of Britain's mortgage market and sparked a protracted investigation by the UK's competition authorities. </p> <p>James Crosby, the chief executive of HBOS, said the risk of overpaying or being blocked on competition grounds had been too high for the firm to proceed with a bid. </p> <p>\"The heart would have loved to have done it, but the head says, 'Don't compromise what you are already doing for your shareholders,'\" he said. \"We always said this was a one-off opportunity we simply had to crawl all over, and that's what we have done.\" </p> <p>Analysts who had been anticipating an HBOS counterbid for Abbey were surprised Mr Crosby was walking away from the opportunity.</p> <p>Abbey shares had been trading above the value of Santander's equity-based offer, in anticipation of a bidding war. But as HBOS decided not to bid, they fell 6.2% to close at 572.50p, making Abbey the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 index. HBOS shares rose 3.3% to 738p, make it the strongest gainer amid relief that it had avoided an expensive takeover battle. </p> <p>Santander, which has been expanding aggressively in Latin America, agreed in July to buy Abbey in what would be Europe's biggest cross-border retail banking deal. </p> <p>\"I'm very pleased that the uncertainty has disappeared. We remain on track and Santander is determined to close the deal,\" Mr Bot\u00edn said. </p> <p>The Spanish banking group also said it expected efficiency savings from the deal to reach \u20ac450m (\u00a3307m) a year within three years of completion, and that revenues were now expected to add \u20ac220m a year to pre-tax profits by 2007, an increase on its previous estimates.</p> <p>Spain's biggest bank said documents detailing its offer would be posted to Abbey investors on Friday and that Abbey shareholders would hold a meeting to ratify the bid on October 14. Santander expects the deal to be completed on November 12.</p>",

  "<p>British universities are now dependent on overseas students to balance their books and teach home students, and the government needs a national strategy to promote them abroad, university heads warned today.</p> <p>The plea from Ivor Crewe, president of Universities UK, was met with a warm response from the education secretary, Charles Clarke, who admitted his white paper on higher education had underplayed the international agenda. </p> <p>Mr Clarke told the UUK annual conference that in November the Department for Education and Skills would produce a report, Putting the world into world class education, which would include the universities' concerns.</p> <p>He also said the government wanted to safeguard subjects of national importance - such as chemistry or Japanese - rather than leaving them to the higher education market.</p> <p>Professor Crewe welcomed Mr Clarke's comments, but said the government was not yet focused on the need to coordinate policy on the international competitiveness of UK universities. For instance, visas charges had suddenly been hiked without any discussion of the impact on overseas student recruitment. </p> <p>\"Any national strategy for the long-term future of UK higher education must start with a commitment to increase the international competitiveness of UK universities - all of them, not a select few. UK universities - again, all of them, not a select few - must operate in a highly competitive global system of higher education,\" Professor Crewe told vice-chancellors at the conference at Keble College, Oxford.</p> <p>British universities faced a growing challenge to their pre-eminent international position, second only to the US, for overseas students and research excellence, he said.</p> <p>Overseas students at UK universities had jumped by 60% between 1997 and 2002, continued Professor Crewe. \"The presence of international students and faculty is no longer an optional, mildly exotic, welcome ingredient of campus life. It is quite simply what makes it possible for the academic enterprise to continue. </p> <p>\"And the reason can be plainly stated. Public investment and fees do not cover the full cost of teaching UK and EU undergraduates.\" </p> <p>Tuition fees would help universities balance their books, but not until later in the decade. \"What will keep us afloat is our continuing ability to attract international students to these islands or to UK degree programmes delivered overseas. This is central to the future of UK higher education. It should, therefore, be central to any national strategy,\" he said.</p> <p>Professor Crewe said Australia and Canada now had national strategies to attract overseas students, while Malaysia and Singapore were investing heavily in their universities to make them regional hubs in the Far East. European universities were offering degrees in English to fish in the same pool with the result that the UK's share of the international student market had slipped from 16% in 1998 to 12% in 2002.</p> <p>American universities would soon be setting up campuses in London to cater for foreign students who were having difficulties getting visas in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. </p> <p>He added: \"A national strategy must cater for the system as a whole. It means that most of our universities, not just our leading research universities, need to be regarded as international players. Rolls Royce and Land Rover were invaluable symbols of British excellence, but, as history reminds us, sales of them alone could not sustain our car industry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Tony O'Reilly's son, Gavin, the chief operating officer of the global publishing empire behind the Independent, today ruled out a bid for the Daily Mirror if the tabloid became available.</p> <p>He said the Mirror was an \"enormous franchise\" but would not fit in with the profile of papers at Independent News &amp; Media (INM).</p> <p>\"It would be a big task. I don't think culturally we are in that [area of the market]. Broadly speaking, our titles are mid-market titles... this is no moral judgment, but we do not have tabloid journalism. </p> <p>\"On the commercial and editorial side it's a different dynamic and we've never been in that space.\"</p> <p>He said the Mirror's fearsome opponents would also put off potential buyers. \"I wouldn't want to go head to head with Rupert [Murdoch] and the Daily Mail. They're two giant gorillas, and the Mirror's caught in the middle.\" </p> <p>The Mirror has not been put up for sale by its owners, Trinity Mirror, but market watchers believe that the chief executive, Sly Bailey, might offload it at some point as she grapples with an increasing decline in circulation which is down almost 9% year on year to 1.82 million from over 2 million.</p> <p>A sign that the company has resigned itself to the downward direction of the sales graph, emerged earlier this year when it argued that it was aiming to maintain its market share rather than circulation.</p> <p>Ivan Fallon, chief executive of the Irish company's UK operations, was equally dismissive of the tabloid as a potential acquisition. \"I have a very clear idea of what I would do with the Telegraph but I haven't got a clue about the Mirror. They are being squeezed from the top and squeezed from the bottom.\"</p> <p>Mr O'Reilly, who is one of Sir Tony's six children and holds the most senior post in his newspaper empire, said today that newspapers should not accept declining sales as a problem inherent in the industry and vowed to keep up the growth of the Independent. </p> <p>The paper has put on 21% in circulation year on year, with 262,588 copies sold on average in August, thanks to its tabloid edition, which was launched a year ago.</p> <p>The fear now for Independent executives is that once the novelty of the tabloid format has worn off, year-on-year figures will tail off again and once more conform to the industry-wide downward trend.</p> <p>Mr O'Reilly said that did not have to be the pattern, and that the key to success was marketing.</p> <p>\"The simple fact is that newspaper publishers need to invest in a growth strategy and most of them have not. Most of them accept a general, gentle decline is the cost of doing business. We can point to underlying revenue increases. </p> <p>\"[When it comes to marketing] we're not talking about promotions and CDs, which is sticking your finger in the dyke. The real challenge is that we have a brand we are trying to get people to buy when they have so many other distractions on their time.\"</p> <p>That could be seen as a swipe at Associated Newspapers, which has spent an estimated \u00a320m promoting their Irish Sunday tabloid, Ireland on Sunday, with free CDs and cover price discounts.</p> <p>\"It's possible to present a growth strategy,\" he added. \"What the industry usually relies on is history and someone falling out of the market and that there will be consolidation.\" </p> <p>He said the company would raise its marketing spend - currently about 5% of its worldwide revenues - but only by sticking to a budget that would not harm its ability to keep profits and cash generation moving upwards.</p> <p>At the moment the Independent and the Independent on Sunday make a loss - \u00a39m in 2003 - but executives at INM expect the titles to \"lose less\" this year and break even or move into profit by the end of 2005.</p> <p>Mr O'Reilly said he believed the marketing campaign that coincided with the launch of the Independent, along with editorial improvements, had contributed to its success.</p> <p>But the company knows it has a fight on its hands from The Times, which has launched a tabloid edition that has struggled to win over readers, and from the Guardian, which has plans for a mid-size \"Berliner\" format in two years' time.</p> <p>He said he believed many of his new readers were coming from the Guardian, which has lost circulation in the past eight months.</p> <p>In Mr O'Reilly's words: \"Welcome to the world of competition... the market ain't gonna stand still.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "No one reading or hearing the prime minister's impassioned speech last night on the urgent need to tackle climate change could doubt his sincerity in this vital area. Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Prince of Wales business and the environment programme, he called it the world's greatest environmental challenge, which was causing global warming at a rate \"that began as significant, has become alarming and is simply unsustainable in the long-term\". He added that the long-term did not mean centuries but within his children's lifetime - and possibly within his own as well. <p>Environmentalists will inevitably be disappointed at the lack of bold new measures. One of the few new items was a pledge to argue strongly for aviation to be brought within the EU's emissions trading scheme when Britain assumes the presidency of the EU next year. This is a thoroughly creditable aim, but is somewhat tarnished by the government's decision earlier this year to endorse a huge expansion of airports, despite advice from a royal commission that no more runways should be built because of the effects on climate change. </p> <p>To be fair, the government has a relatively good record on climate change, both compared with its own targets in other policy areas and set against what other countries are doing. Even its critics admit that the government is on course to meet its Kyoto target of a 12.5% decline in greenhouse gas emissions during the 20 years to 2010 - even though much of the progress is due to the decline of coal, which was engineered by the previous Conservative administration. </p> <p>During the course of a thoughtful speech on the environment this week Michael Howard, the Tory leader, was right to point out that under Tony Blair's watch CO2 emissions have actually risen. He was also right to call Labour's policy on transport a \"jumble of contradictions\". Good green rhetoric by Labour has been undermined by a failure to solve the growing problems of road transport (not least by abandoning the Conservatives' fuel duty escalator) and by endorsing airport expansion. Yesterday, Mr Blair said that the minimum standard for the energy performance of new houses was being raised by 25% a year. That is fine - but he did not say whether the benefits would be negated by the huge number of new homes to be built as part of the government's plans to solve the housing crisis. </p> <p>Individual countries can make big contributions on their own. The scope for Britain to exploit wind, solar and wave power - and to build an international business in the process - is enormous. The government has already made substantial progress with wind power and its intention to stimulate the harnessing of energy from wave power makes its aspiration to have 20% of Britain's energy requirements met from renewable resources by 2020 a credible aim. Mr Blair was careful yesterday, however, not to rule out more nuclear plants. </p> <p>Yet in the end this is a global problem. It therefore needs a global solution. Next year, Britain intends to use its presidency of the European Union and, more important, the G8 group of leading industrialised countries, to negotiate a blueprint for survival. Mr Blair's most urgent priority to help stem global warning is to use whatever influence he will have on the Bush administration (if it wins the November election) to persuade the US to accept the Kyoto targets. America has under 5% of the world's population but is responsible for almost 25% of carbon dioxide emissions. This task will not be easy because, as Mr Blair reminded us yesterday, the US senate voted 95-0 to refuse ratification. But bringing the US back on board is the single most important thing that needs to be done to conquer climate change. The world - and Mr Blair - have a lot to gain from that.</p>",

  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday September 28 2004</strong></p> <p> Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) has informed us that it was mistaken in the salt content it attributed to Sainsbury's breakfast cereal. In the article below we quote Cash as saying the cereal has 1.84g of salt per portion. In fact, it has significantly less salt, as the packaging makes clear. Cash has apologised to Sainsbury's for its error. </p> <p> </p> <p> Civilisation is built on salt. The discovery of its power to preserve food enabled wandering tribes to put down roots. Men and women could hunt and gather today and eat tomorrow. A life that was no longer hand to mouth allowed time to sit and think. Salt became as precious as any metal, was traded between nations and offered as gifts. Its influence lingers in our linguistic value judgments: a good man is the salt of the earth and worth his salt, but a social inferior sits below it. </p> <p>But the white crystals have lost their magic. \"It wasn't a gift for civilisation. It was a poison,\" says Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine and the one man who has probably done more than any other to shake our confidence in a substance traditionally offered with bread as a sign of friendship to strangers. </p> <p>MacGregor is chairman of Cash (Consensus Action on Salt and Health) and is this week savouring the sweet taste of success. Ten years after he and fellow experts on blood pressure began pressing for limits on the amount of salt we eat, which they say is implicated in 120,000 heart attack deaths a year in the UK, the Food Standards Authority has launched a \u00a34m campaign to persuade us to eat less of it - and manufacturers to cut the sackfuls they pour into our processed foods. </p> <p>But it isn't the salt on your table that does the damage - it's the salt in your lasagne and, more alarmingly, your bread. The FSA says that 75% of our salt comes from processed foods, and that an adult consumes 9.5g a day, though we don't need more than 6g. Baked beans, breakfast cereals, pizza, soup and cooking sauces tend to be salt-lavish, but so are some sweet foods, such as biscuits and hot chocolate. </p> <p>Why does our food contain so much salt? Not only because manufacturers found it made their products taste more interesting, but also because it binds in water, thus cheaply adding \"texture\" or bulk. It also makes you thirsty - another knock-on effect for the food and drink industry. </p> <p>MacGregor argues that thousands of lives could be saved by cutting the salt content of processed foods by 10-20%. \"If salt intake was reduced to 6g a day, it would prevent 70,000 heart attacks per year, 35,000 of which are fatal. It is as big an improvement as when they put drains into London,\" he says. </p> <p>Unusually for a bunch of scientists, Cash is extremely media-savvy. It was naming and shaming high-salt foods, lambasting individual manufacturers and barbecuing supermarkets long before health minister Melanie Johnson got in on the act. This month it scored a direct hit on Sainsbury's, fingering the company's \"Be good to yourself\" flakes and orchard fruits as one of \"the UK's saltiest foods\". One 50g portion contained 1.84g of salt, it said. Sainsbury's immediately pulled the product off the shelves. </p> <p>Back in 1994, the government's advisory Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition (known as Coma) recommended a model diet for the UK, including a reduction to 6g of salt a day. The food industry obtained a leaked draft and four heavyweight food manufacturers, Cadbury Schweppes, Tate and Lyle, United Biscuits and Mars demanded a meeting with the department of health. They did not get the reassurance they wanted. That same year, United Biscuits and Tate and Lyle cut their contributions to the Tory party. </p> <p>MacGregor is convinced that this contributed to the government's rejection of the recommended salt level which has now been espoused by the FSA. \"That really infuriated us - that for a few thousand pounds, the health policy of the UK could be altered,\" he says. </p> <p>Cash was formed in 1996 to press the case through the media instead of polite government channels. It has worked better than they imagined. \"If you had said to me in 1996 that in 2004 the FSA would launch a \u00a34m campaign about the dangers of salt, I'd have said you were joking,\" says MacGregor. It took almost 40 years to get serious action on smoking, he points out. </p> <p>As any school child knows, salt is scientifically known as sodium chloride. It's a simple combination of two elements, easily extracted from sea water. Salt's primitive appeal must have to do with its bodily familiarity - our tears are salty; our blood is salty. But the question is how much we need of it. Chimpanzees and orang-utans get their sodium from plants they eat, not the salt cellar, and they have perfect blood pressure of around 90 over 70. High blood pressure, increasingly common in the UK where it rises steadily with age, is responsible for half the heart attacks and strokes that kill people here - 120,000 out of 240,000 a year. </p> <p>MacGregor claims there is virtually no scientific dispute in the UK over the link between salt, high blood pressure and heart attacks. Excess salt, says MacGregor, leads to water retention. People who eat too much salt could have a litre and a half of extra fluid sloshing around in their veins, he says. That means there is more blood for the heart to pump, and the blood pressure goes up. </p> <p>The question of how much is too much, however, seems to vary from person to person. It's quite possible that some of us can eat salt without living dangerously. Five years ago a team from the University of Utah school of medicine (in Salt Lake City, of course) identified three variations in a bit of human machinery called the angiotensinogen gene. High levels of a hormone produced by this gene also correlated with high blood pressure. They reported in 1998 that variants in the gene made some people much more sensitive to salt. So for some, a low salt diet had a significant effect on blood pressure. </p> <p>There is more than one cause of high blood pressure. But most people in the field believe that maybe one third of all hypertension sufferers are reacting to the buildup of sodium. Yet some humans feel they need salt, and some feel the need for salty food at all times. Six years ago Ilene Bernstein, of the University of Washington, proposed that babies might arrive with a taste for salt implanted at birth. </p> <p>It depended, she and colleagues claimed, on just how nauseous and uncomfortable their mothers felt during early pregnancy. They reported in 1998 that adult children of mothers who had experienced morning sickness to conspicuous levels were also very keen on salty snack foods. Babies at 16 weeks old were more likely to show a fondness for salty water if they had previously sent their mothers-to-be retching to the bathroom. Her guess was that dehydration linked with vomiting might have something to do with a fondness for salt. </p> <p>\"Fluid depletion in the mother triggers the hormonal system in the blood and kidneys to restore the normal fluid level,\" said Bernstein. \"We don't know if these hormones cross the placental barrier and affect the baby or if dehydration causes the baby to release its own hormones to restore fluid balance. These hormones can have powerful effects on the brain.\" </p> <p>Such claims are contentious. But they do illustrate the complex link between salt and the functioning of the human machinery. Some babies show a distinct response to (very slightly) salty tastes within three days of birth, the response being strongest in those babies who have at least one grandparent with a history of hypertension, according to the journal Hypertension in 2002. A team from Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge Massachusetts tested 283 babies in their sucking response to the taste of salt and sugar. The 67 babies that seemed to like salt most already had, at three days, higher blood pressure levels than those who seemed to object to the taste. </p> <p>Such research seems to suggest that appetite, inheritance and environment all play a part in the link between salt and hypertension. But this is not saying very much: appetite, inheritance and environment play a role in practically everything. Nobody is yet prepared to suggest that a warm response to a hint of the flavour of salt is really an indicator of some future cardiovascular troubles to come. </p> <p>Salt manufacturers are unsurprisingly unhappy at the turn of events in the UK, in spite of the fact that most of what they produce ends up on the roads rather than in our baked beans. \"The biggest problem we have is that the deer on the roads lick up the salt - they like it just as we do,\" says Peter Sherratt, general secretary of the Salt Manufacturers' Association. </p> <p>While the food manufacturers agree to salt reductions here and there - although not as comprehensively as the FSA and Cash want - Sherratt insists much of the science is nonsense.\"A heck of a lot of literature says the government is wrong.\" </p> <p>He cites two documents that have come out within recent months. The national diet and nutrition survey commissioned by the government says salt has no effect on the blood pressure of healthy people, while the National Institute for Clinical Excellence says that people with high blood pressure should be on drugs to control it. \"I don't understand where salt comes into the equation,\" he says. \"There is no problem with a healthy person, and an unhealthy person should be on drugs.\" </p> <p>If some of us are more susceptible to salt-related damage than others, maybe there is an element of sense in that, but that's not how public health strategies work. We all have to eat less salt because we don't know who the lucky people are who can eat crisps with impunity. And if we won't even notice a small cut in our salt intake, then it's hard to see the problem for anybody except a salt manufacturer - or a processed food company that has to have another think about how to make its pizzas taste good.</p>",
  "<p>A huge ice-skating rink will be opened at Cornwall's Eden Project and a party held at London's Tate Modern to celebrate the national lottery's 10th birthday, it was announced today, as yet another lottery-funded project closes.</p> <p>Scores of famous lottery-funded projects will also be opening for free over the weekend of November 6-7.</p> <p>But the announcement was marred by the closure of the \u00a350m Earth Centre outside Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Britain's first landmark millennium attraction.</p> <p>Trustees said the project was no longer viable and that 51 of its 75 staff were being made redundant. Doors to visitors were closed without warning on Monday. The centre will be handed over to Doncaster council as part of a proposal to keep it open in some form.</p> <p>This is just the latest lottery-funded attraction to shut or run into serious financial problems. Others have included the Millennium Dome, the National Botanical Gardens of Wales, the Bradford faith centre, the National Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield, and the Centre for Visual Arts in Cardiff.</p> <p>But the festivities will gloss over these difficulties. Instead there will be an awards ceremony to recognise the nation's favourite lottery-funded projects and individuals.</p> <p>More than \u00a316bn has been raised for \"good causes\" since the national lottery was launched in 1994. </p> <p>The green-themed Earth Centre received \u00a336m of lottery money via the Millennium Commission. It had been plagued with problems since it opened in April 1999. Built on the site of two former pits, it aimed to educate people on how to live and work in a sustainable environment and was to play a key role in regenerating the area. </p> <p>It was expected to attract 500,000 visitors in its first year, but proved a flop with the public when only 80,000 came through the gates. </p> <p>The project, which boasts exhibits on recycling sewage, was reopened in 2001 on a smaller scale after a major refurbishment. </p> <p>Visitor numbers steadily increased and the centre did appear to be on course to hit its visitor number targets. The Millennium Commission's director, Mike O'Connor, said: \"We are delighted that Doncaster council has taken up the challenge of ensuring that the Earth Centre achieves its mission of providing much needed education on how we can protect our natural environment. </p> <p>\"I would like to thank all those who have worked so hard to turn what was a derelict site into a beautiful facility for education and leisure.\" </p> <p>The elected mayor of Doncaster, Martin Winter said: \"I am pleased to be able to further the objectives of Earth Centre and we will be exploring ways in which that can be done. I can give the assurance that we will not be taking over the centre with any financial risks to the taxpayers of Doncaster and will announce further details of our plans in the coming weeks.\"</p>",
  "<b>11.45am:</b> <br> Hunting is the only issue interesting MPs, protesters and the media today - with several hundred pro-hunting campaigners camped on Parliament Square for this afternoon's debate and vote. <p>However, Michael Howard may be tempted to stray into the reignited row over Mr Blair's apparent vacillations over stepping down, following Lord Bragg's loose words last night.</p> <p>And Charles Kennedy is likely to plug the Lib Dems new mini-manifesto - especially since he's still smarting from the PM rubbishing the costings in it last week. </p> <p><b>12pm:</b><br> Cardiff North's Julie Morgan raises the plight of the one-in-four female pensioners who live in poverty.

Everyone laughs. </p> <p>Nottingham's Graham Allen asks about urban regeneration - shortly followed by Tory Laurence Robertson on the same subject. Building more housing, and closing post offices, increases car traffic, he says - something the PM insisted he would tackle in his environment speech last night.</p> <p>\"We can't support every rural post office\" says Mr Blair.</p> <p><b>12.30pm:</b><br> Eltham's Clive Efford celebrates better housing in his south London constituency - but will Mr Blair encourage local councils to build more council houses?</p> <p>Mr Blair does not go that far.</p>",

  "The 10th anniversary of His Royal Highness' Business and the Environment Programme marks what is now recognised as the premier international forum for exploring sustainable development in the context of business. <p>Over the coming months we will take forward the wider sustainable development and environment agenda. Margaret Beckett is working on a comprehensive Defra 5-year programme to be released this year and a new sustainable development strategy for early next year. This will deal with, amongst other matters, issues of waste, recycling, sustainable agriculture, all aspects of biodiversity; and fishing, and will set out policies in each key area. For example, on the marine environment, I believe there are strong arguments for a new approach to managing our seas, including a new marine bill.</p> <p>But tonight I want to concentrate on what I believe to be the world's greatest environmental challenge: climate change.</p> <p>Our effect on the environment, and in particular on climate change, is large and growing </p> <p>To summarise my argument at the outset:</p> <p>From the start of the industrial revolution more than 200 years ago, developed nations have achieved ever greater prosperity and higher living standards. But through this period our activities have come to affect our atmosphere, oceans, geology, chemistry and biodiversity. </p> <p>What is now plain is that the emission of greenhouse gases, associated with industrialisation and strong economic growth from a world population that has increased sixfold in 200 years, is causing global warming at a rate that began as significant, has become alarming and is simply unsustainable in the long-term. And by long-term I do not mean centuries ahead. I mean within the lifetime of my children certainly; and possibly within my own. And by unsustainable, I do not mean a phenomenon causing problems of adjustment. I mean a challenge so far-reaching in its impact and irreversible in its destructive power, that it alters radically human existence.</p> <p>The problem and let me state it frankly at the outset - is that the challenge is complicated politically by two factors. First, its likely effect will not be felt to its full extent until after the time for the political decisions that need to be taken, has passed. In other words, there is a mismatch in timing between the environmental and electoral impact. Secondly, no one nation alone can resolve it. It has no definable boundaries. Short of international action commonly agreed and commonly followed through, it is hard even for a large country to make a difference on its own.</p> <p>But there is no doubt that the time to act is now. It is now that timely action can avert disaster. It is now that with foresight and will such action can be taken without disturbing the essence of our way of life, by adjusting behaviour not altering it entirely. </p> <p>There is one further preliminary point. Just as science and technology has given us the evidence to measure the danger of climate change, so it can help us find safety from it. The potential for innovation, for scientific discovery and hence, of course for business investment and growth, is enormous. With the right framework for action, the very act of solving it can unleash a new and benign commercial force to take the action forward, providing jobs, technology spin-offs and new business opportunities as well as protecting the world we live in.</p> <p>But the issue is urgent. If there is one message I would leave with you and with the British people today it is one of urgency.</p> <p>Let me turn now to the evidence itself.</p> <p>The scientific evidence of global warming and climate change: UK leadership in environmental science</p> <p>Apart from a diminishing handful of sceptics, there is a virtual worldwide scientific consensus on the scope of the problem. As long ago as 1988 concerned scientists set up an unprecedented Intergovernmental Panel to ensure that advice to the world's decision-makers was sound and reliable.</p> <p>Literally thousands of scientists are now engaged in this work. They have scrutinised the data and developed some of the world's most powerful computer models to describe and predict our climate.</p> <p>UK excellence in science is well documented: we are second only to the US in our share of the world's most cited publications. </p> <p>And amongst our particular strengths are the environmental sciences, lead by the world-renowned Hadley and Tyndall centres for climate change research. </p> <p>And from Arnold Schwarzenegger's California to Ningxia Province in China, the problem is being recognised.</p> <p>Let me summarise the evidence:</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The 10 warmest years on record have all been since 1990. Over the last century average global temperatures have risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius: the most drastic temperature rise for over 1,000 years in the northern hemisphere.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Extreme events are becoming more frequent. Glaciers are melting. Sea ice and snow cover is declining. Animals and plants are responding to an earlier spring. Sea levels are rising and are forecast to rise another 88cm by 2100 threatening 100m people globally who currently live below this level.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The number of people affected by floods worldwide has already risen from 7 million in the 1960s to 150 million today.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In Europe alone, the severe floods in 2002 and had an estimated cost of $16bn.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This summer we have seen violent weather extremes in parts of the UK. </p> <p> These environmental changes and severe weather events are already affecting the world insurance industry. Swiss Re, the world's second largest insurer, has estimated that the economic costs of global warming could double to $150bn each year in the next 10 years, hitting insurers with $30-40bn in claims. </p> <p>By the middle of this century, temperatures could have risen enough to trigger irreversible melting of the Greenland ice-cap - eventually increasing sea levels by around seven metres. </p> <p>There is good evidence that last year's European heat wave was influenced by global warming. It resulted in 26,000 premature deaths and cost $13.5bn. </p> <p>It is calculated that such a summer is a one in about 800 year event. On the latest modelling climate change means that as soon as the 2040s at least one year in two is likely to be even warmer than 2003. </p> <p>That is the evidence. There is one overriding positive: through the science we are aware of the problem and, with the necessary political and collective will, have the ability to address it effectively. </p> <p>The public, in my view, do understand this. The news of severe weather abroad is an almost weekly occurrence. A recent opinion survey by Greenpeace showed that 78% of people are concerned about climate change.</p> <p>But people are confused about what they can do. It is individuals as well as governments and corporations who can make a real difference. The environmental impacts from business are themselves driven by the choices we make each day. </p> <p>To make serious headway towards smarter lifestyles, we need to start with clear and consistent policy and messages, championed both by government and by those outside government. Telling people what they can do that would make a difference. </p> <p><b>UK Action</b><br></p> <p>I said earlier it needed global leadership to tackle the issue. But we cannot aspire to such leadership unless we are seen to be following our own advice.</p> <p>So, what is the UK government doing? We have led the world in setting a bold plan and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>We are on track to meet our Kyoto target. The latest estimates suggest that greenhouse gas emissions in 2003 were about 14% below 1990 levels. But we have to do more to achieve our commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010.</p> <p>Our targets are ambitious and we must continually review and refine how we can meet them. In 2000, we published our Climate Change Programme, which set out a comprehensive range of policies aimed at reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Tomorrow, we'll be setting out the details of this review to see if it is achieving the necessary progress towards our short-term and long-term emissions targets, and if not, to see how we can do better.</p> <p>In the longer term, The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's seminal report on energy concluded that to make its contribution towards tackling climate change, the UK needed to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2050. This implies a massive change in the way this country produces and uses energy. We are committed to this change.</p> <p>There are immense business opportunities in sustainable growth and moving to a low carbon economy</p> <p>The UK has already shown that it can have a strongly growing economy while addressing environmental issues. Between 1990 and 2002 the UK economy grew by 36%, while greenhouse gas emissions fell by around 15%. </p> <p>But business itself must seize the opportunities: it is those hi-tech, entrepreneurial businesses with the foresight and capability to tap into the UK's excellent science base that will succeed. Tackling climate change will take leadership, dynamism and commitment - qualities that I know are abundantly represented in this room. </p> <p>As part of next year's G8 process I want to advance work on promoting the development and uptake of cleaner energy technologies begun under the French presidency in 2003 and continued by the US this year. </p> <p>We need both to invest on a large scale in existing technologies and to stimulate innovation into new low carbon technologies for deployment in the longer term. There is huge scope for improving energy efficiency and promoting the uptake of existing low carbon technologies like PV, fuel cells and carbon sequestration. </p> <p>This technology is coming out of the laboratory and becoming reality in new fuel cell cars, combined heat and power generators and in new low carbon fuels. The next generation of photovoltaics are unlikely to need the now familiar panels: smart windows could generate the power required for new buildings. And carbon sequestration: literally capturing carbon and storing it in the ground, also has real potential. BP are already involved in an Algerian project which aims to store 17 million tonnes of CO2.</p> <p>What we need to do is build an international consensus on how we can speed up the introduction of these technologies</p> <p>And there are already many great examples of companies here in the UK showing the way:</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ceres Power based in Crawley and utilising technology developed at Imperial College have developed a new fuel cell that has unique properties and is a world leader, and</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> just a few weeks ago Ocean Power Delivery transmitted the first offshore wave energy from the seas off Orkney to the UK grid. </p> <p>And these are not isolated examples. </p> <p>Understandably, climate change focuses minds on big, industrial, energy users. But retailers are also working with suppliers to reduce the impacts of goods and services that they sell. I want to see the day when consumers can expect that environmental responsibility is as fundamental to the products they buy as health and safety is now.</p> <p>Government has to work with business to move forward, faster. For example, we will help business cut waste and improve resource efficiency and competitiveness through a programme of new measures funded through landfill tax receipts. We will follow up the report of the Sustainable Buildings Task Group to raise environmental standards in construction. </p> <p>The Carbon Trust is helping business to address their energy use and encourage low-carbon innovation. In total, efficiency measures are expected to save almost 8 million tonnes of carbon from business by 2010, more than 10% of their emissions in 2000.</p> <p>Our renewables obligation has provided a major stimulus for the development of renewable energy in the UK. It has been extended to achieve a 15.4% contribution from renewables to the UK's electricity needs by 2015, on a path to our aspiration of a 20% contribution by 2020. In the short term, wind energy - in future increasingly offshore - is expected to be the primary source of smart, renewable power.</p> <p>Our position on nuclear energy has not changed. And as we made clear in our energy white paper last year, the government does \"not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets.\" </p> <p>In short, we need to develop the new green industrial revolution that develops the new technologies that can confront and overcome the challenge of climate change; and that above all can show us not that we can avoid changing our behaviour but we can change it in a way that is environmentally sustainable.</p> <p>Just as British know-how brought the railways and mass production to the world, so British scientists, innovators and business people can lead the world in ways to grow and develop sustainably.</p> <p>I am confident business will seize this opportunity. Cutting waste and saving energy could save billions of pounds each year. With about 90% of production materials never part of the final product and 80% of products discarded after single use, the opportunities are clear.</p> <p>Local, practical sustainability: new schools, new housing and re-invigorating 'Agenda 21'</p> <p>But government can give a lead in its own procurement policy.</p> <p><b>New sustainable schools</b><br></p> <p>There is a huge school building programme underway. All new schools and City Academies should be models for sustainable development: showing every child in the classroom and the playground how smart building and energy use can help tackle global warming. </p> <p>The government is now developing a school specific method of environmental assessment that will apply to all new school buildings. Sustainable development will not just be a subject in the classroom: it will be in its bricks and mortar and the way the school uses and even generates its own power. </p> <p>Our students won't just be told about sustainable development, they will see and work within it: a living, learning, place in which to explore what a sustainable lifestyle means.</p> <p><b>Housing</b><br></p> <p>The economic and social case for new housing is compelling. But we must also ensure that our approach is environmentally sustainable. This means action at both the national and local level. Heating, lighting and cooling buildings produces about half of total UK carbon emissions.</p> <p>In 2002 we raised the minimum standard for the energy performance of new buildings by 25%. And next year we'll raise it by another 25%. The challenge now is to work with the building industry to encourage sustainability to be part of all new housing through a new flexible Code for Sustainable Buildings. </p> <p>The new developments proposed in specific parts of the south east including the Thames Gateway represent a huge opportunity for us to show what can be achieved in terms of modern, smart, 21st century, sustainable living: not just in terms of reduced energy use, but also through better waste management, sustainable transport and availability of quality local parks and amenities. </p> <p><b>Re-invigorating Agenda 21</b><br></p> <p>Many local communities understand the links between the need to tackle national and global environmental challenges and everyday actions to improve our neighbourhoods and create better places to live. </p> <p>In 1997, I encouraged all local authorities to work with their communities and produce Local Agenda 21 plans by 2000. </p> <p>There was an overwhelming response: from County Durham to Wiltshire and from Redbridge to Cheshire, local people showed what could be done. Next year, as a key part of our new Sustainable Development Strategy, I want to reinvigorate community action on sustainable development.</p> <p><b>Action in the EU</b><br></p> <p>From this base, of domestic action we move out to action Europe-wide.</p> <p>We believe, as I know many of you do, that trading is the most cost effective way to reduce emissions. The emissions trading scheme which we have advocated and pushed in Europe is of great importance to our goals, and to those of Europe. The establishment of a carbon trading market throughout the world's most important economic area next year will be an enormous achievement, and will change the way thousands of businesses think about their energy use. Cutting carbon emissions is the way the future will be, and we have repeatedly said that there are advantages to British industry from early action</p> <p>In Britain and throughout the world, the expected rapid growth in demand for transport, including aviation, means that we must develop far cleaner and more efficient aircraft and cars. </p> <p>I am advised that by 2030, emissions from aircraft could represent a quarter of the UK's total contribution to global warning. A big step in the right direction would be to see aviation brought into the EU emissions trading scheme in the next phase of its development. During our EU Presidency we will argue strongly for this. </p> <p>And the UK is taking a strong lead globally</p> <p>From Europe, we need then to secure action world-wide. Here it is important to stress the scale of the implications for the developing world. It is far more than an environmental one, massive though that is. It needs little imagination to appreciate the security, stability and health problems that will arise in a world in which there is increasing pressure on water availability; where there is a major loss of arable land for many; and in which there are large-scale displacements of population due to flooding and other climate change effects. </p> <p>It is the poorest countries in the world that will suffer most from severe weather events, longer and hotter droughts and rising oceans. Yet it is they who have contributed least to the problem. That is why the world's richest nations in the G8 have a responsibility to lead the way: for the strong nations to better help the weak.</p> <p>Such issues can only be properly addressed through international agreements. Domestic action is important, but a problem that is global in cause and scope can only be fully addressed through international agreement. Recent history teaches us such agreements can achieve results.</p> <p>The 1987 Montreal Protocol - addressing the challenge posed by the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer - has shown how quickly a global environmental problem can be reversed once targets are agreed. </p> <p>However, our efforts to stabilise the climate will need, over time, to become far more ambitious than the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto is only the first step but provides a solid foundation for the next stage of climate diplomacy. If Russia were to ratify that would bring it into effect.</p> <p>We know there is disagreement with the US over this issue. In 1997 the US Senate voted 95-0 in favour of a resolution that stated it would refuse to ratify such a treaty. I doubt time has shifted the numbers very radically.</p> <p>But the US remains a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the US National Academy of Sciences agree that there is a link between human activity, carbon emissions and atmospheric warming. Recently the US Energy Secretary and Commercial Secretary jointly issued a report again accepting the potential damage to the planet through global warming.</p> <p>Climate change will be a top priority for our G8 Presidency next year</p> <p>Recently, I announced that together with Africa, climate change would be our top priority for next year's G8. I do not under-estimate the difficulties. This remains an issue of high and fraught politics for many countries. But it is imperative we try. </p> <p>I want today to highlight three key parts of my G8 strategy.</p> <p>First, I want to secure an agreement as to the basic science on climate change and the threat it poses. Such an agreement would be new and provide the foundation for further action.</p> <p>Second, agreement on a process to speed up the science, technology, and other measures necessary to meet the threat.</p> <p>Third, while the eight G8 countries account for around 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is vital that we also engage with other countries with growing energy needs - like China and India; both on how they can meet those needs sustainably and adapt to the adverse impacts we are already locked into.</p> <p>Given the different positions of the G8 nations on this issue, such agreement will be a major advance; but I believe it is achievable.</p> <p>The G8 presidency is a wonderful opportunity to give a big push to international opinion and understanding, among businesses as well as governments.</p> <p>We have to recognise that the commitments reflected in the Kyoto protocol and current EU policy are insufficient, uncomfortable as that may be, and start urgently building a consensus based on the latest and best possible science. </p> <p>Prior to the G8 meeting itself we propose first to host an international scientific meeting at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter in February. More than just another scientific conference, this gathering will address the big questions on which we need to pool the answers available from the science: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> \"What level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is self-evidently too much?\" and <b>\u00b7</b> \"What options do we have to avoid such levels?\" </p> <p>This can help inform discussion at the G8.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p> <p>The situation therefore can be summarised in this way:</p> <p><b>1</b><br> If what the science tells us about climate change is correct, then unabated it will result in catastrophic consequences for our world.</p> <p><b>2 </b><br>The science, almost certainly, is correct.</p> <p><b>3 </b><br>Recent experience teaches us that it is possible to combine reducing emissions with economic growth.</p> <p><b>4 </b><br>Further investment in science and technology and in the businesses associated with it has the potential to transform the possibilities of such a healthy combination of sustainability and development.</p> <p><b>5 </b><br>To acquire global leadership, on this issue Britain must demonstrate it first at home. </p> <p><b>6 </b><br>The G8 next year, and the EU presidency provide a great opportunity to push this debate to a new and better level that, after the discord over Kyoto, offers the prospect of agreement and action.</p> <p>None of this is easy to do. But its logic is hard to fault. Even if there are those who still doubt the science in its entirety, surely the balance of risk for action or inaction has changed. If there were even a 50% chance that the scientific evidence I receive is right, the bias in favour of action would be clear. But of course it is far more than 50%.</p> <p>And in this case, the science is backed up by intuition. It is not axiomatic that pollution causes damage. But it is likely. I am a strong supporter of proceeding through scientific analysis in such issues. But I also, as I think most people do, have a healthy instinct that if we upset the balance of nature, we are in all probability going to suffer a reaction. With world growth, and population as it is, this reaction must increase.</p> <p>We have been warned. On most issues we ask children to listen to their parents. On climate change, it is parents who should listen to their children.</p> <p>Now is the time to start.</p>",
  "<p>The UK economy continued to create jobs at a steady pace in August as unemployment fell to a 20-year low, official figures showed today.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of people out of work in the three months to July stood at 1.1 million, down 16,000 from the three months to April and the lowest figure since the current method of measuring unemployment began in 1984.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.7% in the quarter to July from 4.8% the previous quarter. For August, the number of people claiming the Jobseeker's Allowance fell by 6,100 to 830,200, slightly less than the expected decline of 10,000 but still bringing the figure to its lowest since July 1975. </p> <p>In percentage terms, the claimant count rate stood at 2.7%, its lowest level since April 1975.</p> <p>Despite a tightening of the labour market, inflationary pressures in terms of average wage growth remained subdued. </p> <p>In the three months to July, average earnings including bonuses increased by 3.8% over the same period a year ago, their weakest pace of growth since last December. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose 4.2%, unchanged from the three months to June. </p> <p>Analysts said the Bank of England would be particularly pleased to see that underlying annual average earnings growth was stable at 4.2%. </p> <p>\"The stability in underlying earnings further eases pressure for another interest rate hike in the near future,\" said Howard Archer, an economist with the consultancy Global Insight.</p> <p>\"Even so, we still believe another 25 basis point hike in interest rates before the end of the year is more likely than not.\"</p> <p>The ONS said the number of people in employment had remained almost unchanged over the quarter but the trend was still upward and there had been an increase over the year. </p> <p>The employment level was 28.3 million in the three months to July 2004, down 1,000 from the previous quarter but up 179,000 on the same three months last year.</p> <p>Of the 25 countries that make up the EU, only four have lower rates of unemployment than Britain: Austria, Cyprus, Ireland and Luxembourg. </p> <p>Manufacturing, however, continued to suffer. The number of people working in the sector was down 93,000 to 3.3 million in the three months to July compared with the same period last year.</p>",
  "<p>Booker-winners, a Booker-hopeful and a Nobel laureate are some of the highlights of this season's Orange Word programme, which kicks off today with Life of Pi author Yann Martel launching his collection of short stories, We Ate the Children Last. </p> <p>Nobel laureate VS Naipaul follows him on stage on September 21. Fresh from the controversy over his recent attack on multiculturalism and Saudi Arabia in a magazine interview, Sir Vidia is likely to deliver a provocative talk as he launches his new novel, Magic Seeds.</p> <p>Moving from an elder of the literary world to its freshest talent, David Mitchell, one of Granta's 'bright young things' and one of the bookies' favourites to win this year's Man Booker prize with his third novel, Cloud Atlas, will be discussing his work and no doubt fielding questions about his Booker hopes. </p> <p>Concluding the prize-winner's division, Irish novelist and Booker-winner Roddy Doyle, will chat about Oh, Play that Thing, and bestselling Whitbread winner Mark Haddon will reveal what life is like after the surprise success of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.</p> <p>Launched in 2001, the Orange Word season is unusual in being a literary festival that runs weekly events over a three-month period. Each talk takes place in a central London theatre in the early evening and lasts for an hour, with a question and answer session and book-signing. This year's festival - which comes from the same stable as the women-only Orange prize for fiction - is also unusual in offering an all-male panel.</p> <p>In what festival director Peter Florence describes as a \"a thrilling, heavy weight line-up,\" political speakers with an axe to grind feature heavily. </p> <p>Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair editor and Bush bete noir, will continue the savaging of the Republican administration which he started in his book What We've Lost, a diatribe against the president's record on the environment and civil liberties. </p> <p>The Blair administration may also receive a battering: Greg Dyke, the BBC director general who resigned over the Hutton report, will be lifting the lid on the BBC and its relations with the government to promote his memoir Inside Story. Elsewhere, oppressive regimes of a different kind will come under the attention of acclaimed investigative journalist and film-maker John Pilger as he examines their hidden agendas. </p> <p>On a lighter note, Rory Bremner will cast his satirical eye over the state of the nation and, away from the rarefied fields of politics and literary prizes, one of biggest draws of the programme will undoubtedly be the perennially popular and inventive Terry Pratchett.</p>",
  "<p>I got home at seven and, unusually, he was home before me. His coat was thrown over a chair and his keys and change scattered on the hall table. My footsteps echoed as I walked down the hall on the newly exposed floorboards. I couldn't go anywhere in our new house without thinking: lighting, curtains, carpets, paint that wall, sand that floor, must get rid of that old junk. I turned the corner into the living room (hideous flowery wallpaper that was definitely coming off tomorrow) and there was Andrew, sitting on the matching flowery sofa, flicking through a newspaper. (Must get rid of that sofa.) He got to his feet when he saw me. \"Emily,\" he smiled. </p> <p>My husband, Andrew Drummond, was tall and broad with thick dark hair which he aimed to keep short but kept forgetting to get cut, and the kind of face that is described as having character. In other words, he had a broken nose and a scar on his chin (only rugby, a long time ago). I always thought he looked - to use an old-fashioned word - handsome. </p> <p>\"So how was the whisky today?\" He smiled broadly. \"Had a good day at the office, dear?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, it was really good again! We tried this very rare pink single malt.\" </p> <p>\"Pink whisky?\" he laughed. \"You've only been working at the Whisky Society a few weeks and already our national drink has become very girlie.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, it's pretty. You'd like it.\" </p> <p>He shook his head and pushed his fingers through his hair, the way he always did when something baffled him. </p> <p>\"It got re-racked into a port cask,\" I explained. \"That's why it's pink and there's port on the nose as well. I think we're going to bottle it, even though it is a bit too girlie for the established market.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think my dad could cope with a pink malt. I don't see it going down well at the golf club.\" </p> <p>\"Golfers are not the target market, to be honest.\" </p> <p>Andrew still looked very amused by the idea. \"So when are you going to launch that? Gay Pride Week?\" </p> <p>\"We want more girls to try whisky.\" I walked over to stand beside the fireplace. He had come home early and bothered to light the fire. What a desirable quality in a man. \"Traditionally, women just don't drink whisky. The industry would love to unlock that market and they've done quite well in other countries but failed spectacularly in the UK, especially with single malts, which at the moment is the only growing sector. Here, marketing teams just stand around like spotty adolescent boys at a party, wondering how to chat up the girls.\" </p> <p>\"So, is this your pet project now? You and Flora are going to show the whisky industry how to talk to girls?\" </p> <p>\"We can try a few ideas out at the Whisky Society. It's a small place and perfect for this sort of experiment. Nothing may come of it but it'll be fun to try. Anyway, I really do like the pink whisky. It's quite robust, despite its girlie appearance. Very strong. There is a bit of nose prickle.\" </p> <p>\"Is that a technical term?\" </p> <p>\"It is, actually. Then quite hot in the mouth and really good with ice.\" </p> <p>\"Ice? That's sacrilege.\" </p> <p>\"No, it's not, honestly.\" </p> <p>\"Did you bring any work home?\" he asked, hopefully. </p> <p>\"Not tonight. I've caught up on the ones I needed to taste for the list.\" </p> <p>\"You can try some of my St Magdalene if you like.\" He disappeared into the kitchen and came back with two glasses of the special bottling of rich lowland. Single cask, first fill. We sat down together on the sofa. I put my feet up and made myself comfortable. \"This is just overtime for you, isn't it?\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm really excited about the pink whisky. Wait till you taste it.\" </p> <p>\"Emily, you're turning into a complete workaholic.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not as bad as you. How was your day, anyway?\" </p> <p>\"Clearly not as much fun as yours.\" </p> <p>\"How come you're home early for a change?\" I asked him. </p> <p>\"I was supposed to have a meeting with my opposite number on a case but her firm postponed it. Great relief, I can tell you.\" </p> <p>\"Is your opposite number a real pain?\" </p> <p>\"She wants my head on a plate.\" He drank, then lay back and stretched out on the sofa. \"But she cancelled,\" he said cheerfully, \"and it's Friday night so we can forget about it.\" </p> <p>I sipped from the glass he had given me and felt deeply contented. \"I like coming home when you're here.\" </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>Suddenly, Flora was back: \"Look who I've found!\"and with her was a man I hadn't seen before. \"This is Jack,\" she said, leading him in like a trophy. \"I found him in the basement bar saying he was waiting for us. Jack, meet Josie and Emily.\" </p> <p>He was quite tall and slender with fair hair and a tanned complexion. He looked a little dishevelled, a little tired, but he was smiling to himself when he sat down at the table. An easy, happy smile. </p> <p>Flora sprang into action. \"Emily, where did you put that bottle? Look at this, Jack. You won't have seen a whisky like this before.\" She held the glass up for a reaction. </p> <p>\"It's only a little bit pink,\" said Jack. </p> <p>\"Only a little bit!\" Flora was put out. \"It's pale salmon pink. This is a ros\u00e9 whisky. It's not coloured or anything, it's natural. This is extremely rare and interesting, Jack.\" </p> <p>He laughed. \"I have no brand loyalty whatsoever.\" </p> <p>\"Jack is what is known as a promiscuous consumer.\" </p> <p>\"Try some,\" I said, and offered him a glass. \"Try some, Josie?\" </p> <p>\"I'd advise you to add water,\" said Flora. Jack tasted it without. \"It's hot\" he said. \"It just tastes very hot.\" </p> <p>\"It's cask strength,\" said Flora. \"It's 58% alcohol by volume. Do what I tell you and add water.\" </p> <p>\"It's a light, fresh lowland,\" I told him. \"Very clean and it will take a good splash of water. If you add the right amount of water, it should feel cooling in the mouth and warming going down.\" </p> <p>\"It's nicer than I thought,\" said Josie, who had put plenty of water in hers. </p> <p>\"I wonder what Diageo would think of this,\" said Jack. </p> <p>\"Who?' asked Josie. </p> <p>\"Diageo, the multi-national drinks company - not to be confused with Dodgio who are even bigger. Dodgio are so big they can do whatever they like. Diageo aren't that big yet. They're still at the stage of making little concessions to the Scottish Whisky Association - things like using a different colour packaging for the new bastardised Cardhu to distinguish it from the old, legitimate single malt.' </p> <p>\"Perhaps 'Bastard Cardhu' would have worked as a name for a new blend?\" suggested Josie. </p> <p>\"Diageo would never have risked anything like that,\" I told her. </p> <p>\"There's Fat Bastard Chardonnay and that's very popular.\" And, asked Flora, \"Isn't there a red wine called Old Git?\" </p> <p>\"There is,\" I admitted, \"but the wine trade is light-years ahead of whisky in terms of marketing innovation.\" </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>\"Emily is doing some very innovative work in whisky at the moment,\" said Jane, keen to steer the conversation at Bill's birthday party somewhere else. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said, making more of an effort. \"Why should we marketing people only address ourselves to middle-aged, boring old fart golfers?' </p> <p>\"I thought they were just your type,\" said Kate. \"You've always been very nice to Andrew.\" </p> <p>I tried to think of a light, tension-relieving reply, but all I could manage was: \"Well, Andrew has always been very nice to me.\" </p> <p>\"Drink?\" asked Jane, bearing down on us with a bottle. </p> <p>\"Have you got any of that Rosebank left?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"You'll be lucky.\" She checked the supplies on the table and found some for me. \"You are lucky,\" she said, pouring out the last of the bottle. </p> <p>\"Emily's got a few radical ideas about whisky, haven't you, Emily?\" said Andrew. </p> <p>\"Really?\" said Kate. \"So it's all right to put ice in your whisky, is it?\" </p> <p>\"You can if you want,\" I said confidently. \"You can do whatever you like. You don't have to be all fuddy-duddy and old-fashioned about it.\" </p> <p>\"No ice for me, thanks,\" said Andrew. </p> <p>\"Oh, go on,\" said Kate. \"You'll have to try harder to keep up, Andrew, or Emily will dump you for a younger model.\" </p> <p>The party wore on. I watched Kate talk and laugh with her old friends, moving easily in the crowd. Andrew was sometimes with her again, as part of a little group. I tried to join in but there were too many old stories and in-jokes for me to really follow the conversation. Andrew often seemed to be at the centre of these stories. </p> <p>\"Emily!\" called someone from the door. \"You should see the bonfire, it's great.\" </p> <p>\"Right!\" I said, relieved to have an excuse to get out of the room. </p> <p>\"Here's some sparklers,\" Jane said, pressing them into my hand. \"And some matches. Go and light them on the beach. Remember to keep the matches away from your whisky.\" </p> <p>I turned to Andrew. \"Are you coming too?\" </p> <p>\"I'll be right out. Won't be a minute.\" </p> <p>Halfway down the garden, I turned to see him and Kate outlined in the kitchen window alone together now. </p> <p>I couldn't face it, standing there in the garden, watching my husband absorbed in conversation with this tall blonde woman he used to love. I turned away and walked across to the beach. There were the others, faces glowing around the blaze of driftwood. They were all laughing, talking about the things they used to get up to when they were my age, happily dropping clangers. Looking out towards the cold North Sea and the dark horizon, I held my sparkler out against the blackness and watched it burn. </p> <p>Eventually Andrew joined his old friends outdoors and I waved a sparkler at him. He didn't realise who it was at first, but then he started walking rapidly down the beach towards me. \"What are you doing standing here all by yourself?\" he asked. \"Here, give me one of those,\" and he started writing my name in sparkling letters, over and over again. EmilyEmily Emily, he wrote. lloveEmily. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extracted from A Nice Girl Like Me by Abigail Bosanko, published by Time Warner Paperbacks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Abigail Bosanko was a whisky-tasting tutor at the Scotch Malt Whisky Society before leaving to become a full-time writer.</p>",

In the first article, Malcolm Dean - then, as now, a Guardian leader writer - considered the likely impact of the newly-elected Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. </em></p> <p> If at any other time in the 34 years since the second world war, a column such as this had been launched there was one forecast that could have been confidently predicted about Society Tomorrow. It was going to get better. But for the first time since the founding of the welfare state, this is no longer true. If Mrs Thatcher proceeds with the cuts she has threatened, society today looks far preferable to society tomorrow ... </p> <p>If a Labour government had won in May, there would have been some cuts to services. But nothing like the size of the cuts that the Conservatives have been considering. These are unprecedented. </p> <p>Traditionally, social policy ministers have relied on the expansion of services to establish their reputations. This has been just as true of Conservative ministers as Labour secretaries of state. The biggest applause, for example, at the 1973 Conservative party conference - the last when they were in office - was reserved for Sir Keith Joseph, who was able to proudly tick off six new social security benefits to the delight of the delegates present. (Even then, he conceded, he had not done nearly enough). </p> <p>There is nothing new in this tradition. It was, after all, an annual Conservative conference that imposed on a reluctant party leader ship in 1950 the target of building 300,000 houses a year - a policy that helped Harold Macmillan, who inherited it, eventually to reach Number 10. </p> <p>RA Butler was in a similar situation in 1941. Keen to push forward with his reforms, Butler found his prime minister, [Winston] Churchill, utterly opposed to the reform of secondary education. The Treasury, too, was following its traditional cautious line ... </p> <p>So what did Butler do? ... He proceeded to push ahead and develop the education proposals his civil servants had drawn up. The result? The 1944 Education Act 2, one of the major reforms of the 20th century. </p> <p>So much for prime ministerial dictates. If Churchill can be outflanked, who's afraid of Mrs T? <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Malcolm Dean, September 19, 1979. </p> <p><strong> Computer divorcing</strong> <br><em>The internet revolution was at least 15 years away when we reported in 1982 on the impact of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES). </em></p> <p> What will happen to social relationships when electronics allow us to communicate easily and cheaply with large numbers of people simultaneously, using our own private message systems? </p> <p>Some insights into the effects of modern communications techniques have now come out of a five-year experiment by the New Jersey Institute of Technology into new ways of letting scientists share their results with each other. </p> <p>Over 1,500 people were provided with terminals (usually like small telex machines) linked by phone line to a central computer, through which messages could be sent to anyone else on the network. </p> <p>It was soon discovered that a whole new medium of communication had been invented, with impact not just on the participants' work but on their whole lives, leading to new personal relationships, new working methods, dependence, addiction, and at least two divorces. </p> <p>Users compose their messages on a keyboard like that of a typewriter, and receive information back either on a linked teleprinter or a screen. They \"log on\" to the system whenever they feel like it by switching on their terminals. The central computer stores the messages, and tells users when they log on what new information is waiting for them. </p> <p>People set up terminals at home as well as in the office so they could use EIES at any hour of the day or night. They changed their working methods so that almost everything they did went through the machine, causing drastic problems whenever there were equipment failures. \"I can't think when the computer is down,\" they would complain. </p> <p>Wives, on the other hand, would complain when the machine was not down. \"You don't talk to me now - you're always on that damned computer,\" was heard a good many times. Two divorces [have been] attributed to EIES. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Rory Johnston, March 26, 1982. </p> <p><strong> Policeman, or an Indian scout for the cavalry?</strong> <br><em>In the wake of the 1981 Brixton riots, the police were urged to tackle racial prejudice within the ranks. We talked to Raza, a young Pakistani officer, about his experiences as a Metropolitan police trainee. </em> </p> <p> Everyone in the group wrote their life history as an essay. This was followed by a talk from each trainee. When Raza's turn came, every person in the room appeared surprised, even shocked. The training sergeant was just as ignorant about his Punjabi village background as the rest. Raza had imagined, vaguely, that police educationalists would have \"done some homework\" about British minority groups. </p> <p>Perhaps it was the training sergeants' lack of \"homework\" that created the habit which upset Raza so greatly at this time. They made it their business to create a constant barrage of remarks of a racial kind ...</p> <p>\"Elephant boy!\" </p> <p>\"You coon!\" </p> <p>His comrades began to use these same terms. If the training sergeants saw fit, then shouldn't they? The official excuse was that this was good conditioning for Raza. </p> <p>\"Get a lot of remarks like this, you will, good hardening for you.\" </p> <p>Raza feels, in retrospect, that the conditioning \"bounced\" back and resulted in his previously well-disposed colleagues accepting a tolerated negative attitude towards minority group members. </p> <p>Raza's depression was worsened by overheard remarks: </p> <p>\"That Paki's failed his exams at Police College once you know.\" </p> <p>\"He's a Muslim, doesn't like women.\" </p> <p>\"Just a wog, like the rest of them.\" </p> <p>He decided to make an effort to counteract the impressions. So far, Raza had escaped making the senior men's breakfast. Now he offered to cook the deeply-loathed bacon. He thought: \"I must get on with them. I chose this job, after all.\" </p> <p>That same morning a WPC remarked that Asian women who give birth to daughters are divorced by their husbands, and the children distributed between the relatives. Raza was so disturbed he could not reply, and left the table hastily. </p> <p>Raza considers himself a competent policeman, in spite of an unsupported training. Hostility in the station is less, racist remarks just as common. A community relations officer informed a group of constables that the West Indian who had been promoted at another station was promoted for political reasons. He wouldn't be clever enough. Wogs aren't, are they? Raza feels the racist attitudes are deeply ingrained, founded in confusion. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Moira Meecham, May 19, 1982. </p> <p><strong> Child care in crisis</strong> <br><em>Relations between social workers and client families were were as fraught in the early 1980s as they are now, as the Guardian's David Hencke discovered. </em></p> <p> About 120 children are taken into care by social services in England and Wales each day. Fewer than 50 of them will leave care within two months, most of whom will return to their parents. </p> <p>Until recently, the remainder might have expected a leisurely assessment, possibly extending into years, while social workers attempted to reunite them with their families. But an increasing number of social services directors are adopting a much tougher line. </p> <p>Spurred on by complaints of inaction, child abuse, wilful neglect and past condemnation by Department of Health and independent inquiries, they often act to break up the family. </p> <p>John Rea Price, director of the London borough of Islington's social care department, put it this way: \"Too many decisions have happened because social workers took non-decisions ... trying to keep families together when it might have been better to make a clean break. Social services is a risk business. We may even sometimes take a wrong decision because we are never certain how things will turn out. </p> <p>\"If one of our decisions unfortunately led to a mother who lost her child throwing herself off the top of a tower block, at least we could say she wasn't carrying the child at the same time.\" </p> <p>It is this sort of strong-mindedness that is bringing a strong reaction ... Some clients [are] unhappy at the way their cases were handled. One woman summed up the lack of communication: \"Social workers - they come to lecture us about our kids. But have you seen their homes? There they all are sitting on bean bags on floorboards, bringing their kids up on vegetarian muck - which the kids hate - then they have the cheek to come round and tell us our carpets are dirty.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Hencke, November 3, 1983. </p> <p><strong> My mad, glad, upside down world</strong> <br><em>Bob Holman left academic life to become a community worker on a Glasgow housing estate in 1976. This is his account, in Society Tomorrow in 1986, of the first 10 years. He retired earlier this year. </em></p> <p> As a social scientist, I operated from a top-down perspective. Academics analyse social problems and then try to convince politicians of the steps to improve services. This approach has two flaws. Mixing with the establishment may bring prestige, but it doesn't seem to help the socially deprived very much. </p> <p>Instead, the outcome often seems to be the expenditure of much public money on large buildings and larger salaries for people who already have jobs with, at best, just marginal gains for the poor. Further, the top-down view may not be accurate because its conveyors have separated themselves from the very people in whose interests they claim to speak. </p> <p>Ten years ago, I left a university chair to start a small community project on a council estate. Now I know there is a view from the underside. </p> <p>A friend has had his children removed permanently because he ill-treated them. It is easy for outsiders to condemn him and to recommend regulations and registers for child abusers. But my wife and I stood by him in an almost empty church as he watched the mother of his kids marry another man. I watched his knuckles turn white as he gripped the pew. Rejected, poverty-stricken, he tried to cope with the children. He went to pieces and resorted to drugs. </p> <p>From the underside, I know that he needed money, support and respect. </p> <p>Soon after I moved in, the three Labour councillors called. \"We know what you'll do,\" one declared. \"Stay a year, write a book, and go.\" The remark had the barb of truth, for professional careers - my own included - can be arranged as a series of short stays, each of which is used as a step to higher status and social advancement. </p> <p>Ten years later, I know there is something to be said for staying. </p> <p>Twice a week, I visit a pensioner still shaken by the death of his wife. He worries about the price of coal. He has exchanged his colour television for a black and white one. I can't do much for him, but he gets upset if I don't call. That means staying. But the staying is also the happiness. </p> <p>A few weeks ago, a young boy said: \"Bob, we've been talking about you in the street and we're all going to come to your funeral.\" I hope it is not an immediate prophesy. But at least he thinks I'll still be in this neighbourhood when I die. I hope so. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bob Holman, March 26, 1986. </p> <p><strong> Big Brother's invisible ball and chain</strong> <br><em>The soaring prison population in the 1980s generated interest in alternatives to jail. We reported the arrival of a US solution - electronic tagging. </em></p> <p> Tomorrow's world of electronic incarceration has arrived. One by one, at a session at the recent American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago, the inventors and the marketing chiefs proudly displayed their wares. </p> <p>David J Hunter, president and chief executive of BI Inc, was there promoting a device trademarked as the BI Home Escort, which at the moment is detaining hundreds of prisoners in their own homes in Michigan. </p> <p>The \"electronic shackle\" is a uniquely encoded, tamper-proof radio beacon fitted to the offender's ankle. It communicates with a receiver fitted in his home. Wearing the anklet, the offender can play football with his children, wash the dishes, watch TV, take a bath. But if he strays more than 150 feet from the receiver, off go the alarm bells in a justice department control centre. </p> <p>The device has a bizarre genesis. The idea occurred to Judge Jack Love, of Albuquerque, who took it from a Spiderman comic and then pursued it when a number of petty offenders locked up in the New Mexico state penitentiary were killed in a prison riot; it seemed improper to him that, in effect, they had received the death sentence for minor crimes. </p> <p>Officialdom endorsed the idea because of the appaling overcrowding in American prisons: in January, Texas released 200 felons because it had nowhere to put them; in Louisiana, the gaolers resolved the problem only by shoving the prisoners into tents in the prison yard. Then there is the money. Prisons cost about $125,000 per prisoner to build and $95 per day per prisoner to run. Electronic home arrest costs $10 a day, and clears the prisons of the embezzler, the drunken driver and the salmon poacher to make room for the arsonist, the rapist and the killer. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Tim Radford, April 1, 1987. </p> <p><strong> I've got Aids</strong> <br><em>As the emergence of Aids triggered a sexual health panic in the second half of the 1980s, we ran occasional extracts from the diary of Chris Dale.

The moment had arrived; I could avoid it no longer. </p> <p>\"Well, actually, Dad, I've not told you everything so far.

When had I caught it? Did William have it? How had he caught it? I lied here a little. William and I had decided from the start that nothing could be gained by trying to calculate who'd infected the other. But now, to protect William, I claimed that I had contracted the infection before meeting him and had subsequently infected him. Whilst Dad was out with the dog, Mum came and asked me how I felt. I started the conversation as I had with my father, but as soon as the word \"Aids\" came up, she walked away, saying: \"I don't want to know any more; I don't want to talk about it.\" <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Chris Dale (pseudonym), June 3, 1987.</p>",
  "Society Guardian launched in 1979, the people in charge of councils were town clerks, and you would use the pronoun \"he\" about them as an unthinking matter of fact. Business was conducted in committees, not cabinets. Chief education officers, and sometimes borough engineers, were powers in the municipal land. Elected members were reverentially addressed as \"councillor\"; no first names. Newspapers even had local government correspondents. <p>Now all local authorities have chief executives and the appointment of a woman is no longer worth a headline - not that newspapers find councils worth reporting. Senior officers sit on management boards, with education down the pecking order, finance towards the front and engineering nowhere. They use a vocabulary - governance, audit, performance, leadership, strategy - that a quarter of a century ago was scarcely heard outside American business schools.</p> <p>So this has been the era of management. We are all executives now, to coin a phrase. Yet this has also been an era of great defensiveness on the part of the public sector, with the political dominance of the Conservatives at Westminster between 1979 and 1997 and the intellectual hegemony of \"new right\" ideas extending into the 21st century. Management, in other words, has been a reaction to external pressures, an attempt by the public sector to convince and palliate its enemies.</p> <p>Among the era's landmarks was the arrival of Michael Heseltine at the old Department of the Environment in 1979. Not himself a Thatcherite, his energetic criticisms of council and government operations left a permanent mark. His legacies were the Audit Commission, which has since held councils in intellectual thrall to its doctrines of corporate performance.</p> <p>From Heseltine also stemmed the management information system for ministers. Frustrated that no one seemed to know who did what in his department, he drew up a great flow chart, identifying functions and responsibilities. He subsequently applied it at the Ministry of Defence. But it was too radical. Even Thatcherite ministers had little appetite for running their departments. Labour ministers have proved even less adept. Judging by the criticism of civil service administrative amateurism in a Demos pamphlet this week, not much has changed.</p> <p>But Heseltine did set another unstoppable ball rolling. He and Margaret Thatcher did not quite say \"public bad, private good\", but that was the gist of their belief, which New Labour partly shares. So, into the public sector have come private executives, deemed to be superior. Public-private partnerships have been promoted, with the implication that it is the public sector that needs to learn. Private business models have been slavishly copied, at the insistence of ministers.</p> <p>So if this has been the era of management, it has also been the era of a particular version of organisational life - a dogma, even. The gap between earnings at the \"top of the office\" and those delivering services has widened. In January 1980, Society Guardian ran an advert for the new job of chief executive (replacing the town clerk) of Brent council in north London, salary \u00a316,992; on the same page, a qualified social worker post in Brixton, south London, was on offer at \u00a37,173; the same jobs would now pay, respectively around \u00a3110,000 and \u00a330,000).</p> <p>The inflation of senior salaries has accelerated since Labour took office in 1997. Ostensible reasons are that chief executives need financial incentives but lower grade workers don't, or chief executives are now in a frame of reference where they compare themselves with risk-taking business people.</p> <p>And yet specifying what exactly changed during this managerial era is far from easy. It would be a brave auditor who, hand on heart, said unequivocally that councils at large are more efficient now than in 1979 - which raises interesting thoughts about what the Audit Commission and the other regulatory bodies have been up to.</p> <p>This summer's efficiency bash, with the Gershon review and Gordon Brown demanding \u00a321bn worth of savings in administrative costs, poses a tricky question. If the public sector is now all those billions \"fatter\" than it need be, what were these business-school-nostrum-spouting public managers up to in preceding years?</p> <p>Colin Talbot, a professor at the University of Nottingham, notes that, across the west, there is no correlation between the size of managerialist reform programmes and the size of the state: in other words, management did not succeed, as the Thatcherites wanted, to \"roll back government\". He adds: \"It's remarkable how what you might call core public sector employment, about 5 million people, is much the same now as it was in 1979.\"</p> <p>The effects of the new public management, as the changes enacted since the early 1980s have been termed, are oddly hard to spot.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> David Walker is editor of Public, the Guardian's new monthly magazine for public sector executives.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> To subscribe to Public magazine go to <a href=\"mailto:publicsubs@theguardian.com\">publicsubs@theguardian.com </a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Part-time places</strong> <br><em>By the late 1980s, changes to the urban environment - triggered by a combination of Thatcherite market forces and the explosion of consumerism - were beginning to be noticed. </em> </p> <p> The spectre of revolution is once again haunting Britain. Now it is the retail revolution that could leave many towns and cities as shattered as if a political revolution had occurred. The third term of a Conservative government committed to allowing market forces to set the terms of regional and local social and economic development may affect civic life and architecture as profoundly as the industrial revolution did. </p> <p>Between 1960 and 1980, the number of supermarkets increased by 2,000%, and now these are being made redundant by superstores and the \"third wave\" development of out-of-town retail warehouses. If these schemes are approved, and mergers continue, we may not be able to tell one town from another before very long. But lack of individual civic identity is only one of the problems. </p> <p>The urban riots of 1981 and 1983 didn't just happen in decaying inner-city areas. Over the past decade, most new towns have experienced fairly serious outbreaks of rioting (which often never reached the national press) and these usually occurred in or around the new shopping centres. In many places I visited, there was an almost palpable hostility between those out spending with credit cards and those with UB40s and nothing to do but watch. In Oxford earlier this year, it was reported that the pedestrian shopping precinct had been the scene of frequent, and often quite violent, street clashes. </p> <p>The real tragedy is that where once cities and towns were places for all kinds of activities - cinemas, dance halls, museums and galleries, pubs and restaurants, cafes, theatres, meetings, open air rallies, promenading, window shopping - the retail revolution has given them one overriding purpose: shopping. Not to have a high disposable income and a credit card is now to be almost dis enfranchised from the civic culture. </p> <p>Pleasurable though it is, there must be more to life than shopping.<br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ken Worpole, September 16, 1987. </p> <p><strong> Yours sincerely, FG Pink</strong> <br><em>In 1990, we published extracts from correspondence between Graham Pink, a charge nurse on the geriatric wards at Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, and his managers, about low staffing levels. Pink was sacked for speaking out, but later won compensation for wrongful dismissal. His story, brought to light by the Guardian's David Brindle, triggered a national debate over 'whistleblowing' in the NHS. </em> </p> <p> <strong> August 24, 1989.</strong> Dear Mr R, On Monday, 10 out of the 24 patients were incontinent - a not unusual situation. One gentleman, in his 100th year, was changed nine times, and when we departed at 8am was lying in a wet bed once more. Another had a massive bowel movement, then, in his derangement, proceeded to wipe the faeces over his head, face, body, down his excessively long finger nails (nail care went out years ago, I'm told), the locker and cot sides. It took two of us 20 minutes to make him warm and comfortable. During this time, we were out of sight and earshot of half the ward and we were the only two on duty at the time. </p> <p>There is so much more that you ought to know of: avoidable injuries to patients (including a death); patients offered a wash once a day! (would you eat your breakfast not having washed your hands for 22 hours?); a very feeble and ill lady being pushed into the dayroom on admission and left there for an hour because a corpse was in the bed she was to occupy (while I had to lie to the relatives). </p> <p>It amounts to a catalogue of shame and neglect which must be brought into the open for our whole community to know of if need be. </p> <p><strong> November 13.</strong> Dear Mr G, What more can I say to convince you? Relate another alarming experience, perhaps? </p> <p>The experience occurred whilst I was alone on the ward; alone, that is, with 20 stricken and vulnerable patients. Two ladies were on commodes and a third had called me. As I jerked and heaved Mrs Gowen (a dense stroke patient) towards the edge of the bed, I heard receding footsteps unsteadily shuffling along the ward, followed by the opening of the main ward door. Someone was leaving and it could only be a patient. Pulling back the curtains, I saw one of our confused ladies on the corridor. Immediately outside the door is a steep flight of stairs ... Realising that for Mrs Gowen to fall to the floor was potentially less life-threatening than what could happen at any moment on the stairs, I left her precariously perched and rushed out of the ward to grab Mrs Neal. I could not reason with her or persuade her back. Meanwhile, the ward door had swung to, leaving the patients, two on commodes calling out, one likely to fall, alone and unattended. </p> <p>And you, Mr G, believe our staffing levels do not put patients in danger. Can we be using the same language, I wonder? <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Graham Pink, April 11, 1990. </p> <p><strong> Run of the river</strong> <br><em>The 1990s saw new attempts to regenerate the great post-industrial cities. Glasgow was designated European capital of culture. Peter Hetherington, then the Guardian's Scotland correspondent, went on walkabout in the city. </em> </p> <p> In the Glasgow suburb of Bridgeton, once represented by the old Red Clydesider Jimmy Maxton, two retired engineers lament the passing of industry in the east end of their city, this year's European Culture Capital. \"Where are the jobs for those youngsters?\" asks John Forrester, pointing to a squad of teenagers. \"Ach, it's better than the thirties and forties,\" says Jackie Stewart. \"But culture? Fine if you've got plenty of money, but if you've got none where's the culture?\" </p> <p>Clydeside's city has spent around \u00a320m on a year-long spectacle of music, dance, theatre, opera and exhibitions. To critics, the extravaganza is an insult to the city's heritage: a \"cultural con\", complained the placards of demonstrators when an ambitious people's exhibition, Glasgow's Glasgow, was opened. To Farquhar McClay, editor of the book Workers' City, Glasgow has become a \"happy-land of yuppiedom, a grotesquerie where the young, upwardly-mobile middle class with fat salaries and expensive tastes are to be the centrepiece and soul ... the wine bar economy is all we've got and it's flourishing.\" </p> <p>The Glasgow of 1990 appears a paradox: corporate wealth and power (over 100 new and emerging office developments, Japanese money and all, worth over \u00a31bn) amassed alongside the same old inner-city areas, where little changes. </p> <p>This year, the city will pay \u00a3151m to service a housing debt of \u00a31.1bn for its 168,000 houses, the largest council stock in Britain. Over 20,000 of them are below tolerable standards, while 60,000 need urgent treatment for dampness. </p> <p>Jim Sillars, MP for Glasgow Govan, recalls a recent meeting with an anxious tenant. \"Culture,\" she said. \"I know all about it.

Guardian reporter Ed Pilkington visited the centre undercover. </em></p> <p> As soon as Mobali arrived at Heathrow airport from South Africa he was picked up by immigration officers. Since then, his view of Britain has been restricted to glimpses of trees snatched through the fences of seven different custodial institutions. From the latest, Campsfield, all you can see from the windows is a green perimeter wall topped by barbed wire. </p> <p>In 13 months, Mobali has seen several men crack under the strain. Some, defeated, have requested to be sent back to their native country. But others, for whom the thought of facing renewed persecution is too painful to contemplate, have no such safety valve. </p> <p>At dinner one evening, Mobali saw a Romanian detainee climb on top of the table. He started singing and dancing hysterically, then threw his food all over the room. Another friend, with no previous history of illness, has been confined almost constantly to the hospital ward since he was detained. When people have been pushed by fear and boredom so close to the edge, it does not take much to tip them over. The roof-top protest at Campsfield is believed to have been triggered by news that a fellow detainee, an Algerian, Ali Tamarat, was about to be deported. Empathy with his plight rapidly turned into anger, anger into violence. </p> <p>Mobali describes Campsfield as a hotel compared to some of the institutions he has seen. The Group 4 guards are courteous and the facilities reasonable. But he is inconsolable. \"I cannot dream any more. I sleep long hours, then sometimes I cannot sleep at all. But I never dream.\" </p> <p>He is constantly pondering his fate, his mind a whirl of hopes and fears. The question that comes back to haunt him with punishing regularity is when, if ever, will he be safe. He has been through an arduous legal treadmill to claim asylum, months of appeals and counter-appeals, and still there is no end in sight. The Court of Appeal recently granted him leave to stay in Britain, but the Home Office would not rest at that. It has insisted on appealing against the appeal, in an Alice Through The Looking Glass world where no decision, however straightforward, is ever final. </p> <p>\"I haven't come here for a good life, for food or for shelter.

The column transferred to the Guardian's G2 section as A Life Inside, and was published as a book of the same name. </em> </p> <p> I thought I had become hardened to self-inflicted death in prison - until Michael died. He was in a cell seven doors down from mine. One Sunday afternoon, at around 2.30, he was found hanging from the bars of his cell window. Several days later, the prison authorities allowed his two sisters and his mother to go into the cell where he had died. </p> <p>They pressed their hands and their faces against the wall underneath the window and called out his name in anguish. The other prisoners had been left unlocked, and, as the women wept, many stood by their doors in respectful silence. In an unprecedented gesture of compassion, the prison governor allowed Michael's family to leave wreaths by his cell door. </p> <p>This was like a revelation - an official acknowledgement of Michael's humanity. The usual procedure had always been for the dead man's cell to be cleaned and re-occupied the next day, even the same day. But Michael's wreaths were left outside the sealed cell door for over a week, accompanied by a lighted candle. </p> <p>In the prison chapel the following Sunday morning, the chaplain read out a letter from one of Michael's sisters in which she thanked his \"mates\" for their courtesy during the family visit to his cell. She was glad that \"at least he had some good mates in there\". I could not hold back my tears as I listened to her words. </p> <p>The sense of my own humanity had been dulled over many years of living in an environment where human dignity is routinely forsaken and where a suicide merits less as a topic of discussion than who's managed to smuggle in a \"parcel\" (drugs). Barely noticing, I'd sunk deeper and deeper into a mire of cynicism. But Michael's death and the authorities' humane response pulled me back. </p> <p>I hope that the call by the Chief Inspector of Prisons to carry out an urgent review of suicide-awareness strategies delivers a similar message to the outside world. The news that those in prison are six times more likely to commit suicide than those on the outside, and the fact that last year's shameful figure of 83 prison suicides in England and Wales is an all-time record, should bring an end to the era of complacency. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Erwin James, January 14, 1998. </p> <p><strong> Childhood - the final reckoning</strong> <br><em>In 1995, Barnardo's allowed people who had been in their care to freely access their own files. Phil Frampton took up the offer ... then wrote movingly about what he discovered in the 733-page dossier on his 18 years as a Barnardo's boy. </em> </p> <p> I was about to discover whether I could cope with My Life I Never Knew. I didn't know what the loose collection of photocopied pages would contain. It was to be a story of racial prejudice, human frailty, bitterness, compassion and sadness. </p> <p>My mother, frightened of her mother discovering the pregnancy, went to stay in a \"Magdalene laundry\" home for unmarried mothers in Cornwall. There, under the Christian Moral Welfare Society, she did penance scrubbing floors and the like. </p> <p>Within three months, my mother applied for me to be taken by Barnardo's. The Barnardo's reports say: \"Any physical defects or maladies: Half-Caste.\" When I was a year old, their reports said I couldn't be put up for adoption because \"he is such a poor specimen of humanity and there are doubts about his intelligence\". </p> <p>My mother resumed her teaching in Birmingham and successfully fought for me to be moved from a home in Devon to one closer to her. \"He is all that I have,\" she wrote, adding, \"I hope to have him with me in a few years.\" But by the time I was two years old my mother was reported as saying that she could no longer see me. She was getting married and her husband-to-be was too jealous. Too jealous of a 24-month-old little boy! </p> <p>At three, I was moved to foster care in Bolton. After my mother died, one of my godmothers would tell me that my mother tried to keep in contact but the letters were blocked and it was too far for her to travel. I was angry at Barnardo's for their callousness. Now I've seen Barnardo's letters requesting my mother to write to me, even visit. Barnardo's tried after all. In vain. </p> <p>At seven, I fractured my skull in a road accident and spent some time in a coma. My mother was contacted. \"I'd rather forget about him,\" my mother is said to have responded. She had married and nailed down the coffin of her past. Reading that hurt. Like I was in the coffin. </p> <p>The old ones say that it is understandable. A lot of it happened back then, they say. My mother had had a hard time. Estranged from her rabid, racist mother, abused as a child by her music teacher, she had finally found a chance of happiness with her husband. What else could she do? the old ones ask. </p> <p>I'll never know quite what my mother thought of what she did. Sometimes it seems like I caused the pain. Like I was to blame. But that's the thing about being a Barnardo boy. <br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Phil Frampton, June 9, 1999. </p> <p><strong> The cold shoulder</strong> <br><em>Despite new Labour's efforts, homelessness remains a problem - and not just in the big cities. </em></p> <p> \"I've been everywhere in the country,\" says Sam, \"but I've never seen so many homeless people as in Cambridge. The council and police don't know about many of the places where the homeless sleep. There's a derelict barge on the river somewhere, and an old hut by the railway station.\" </p> <p>\"Is that the one where you can hear all the rats?\" asks one person begging at the University Church. \"Nah,\" replies Sam, \"they've found another since then.\" </p> <p>One place I especially wanted to see was described to me as a strange hole in a wall, where you have to squeeze through a narrow gap to get inside. It is apparently behind a lamp post, but nobody would tell me where in case the word got out. </p> <p>In the absence of a winter shelter, it is particularly important that the best locations remain secret. </p> <p>The other week, at the beginning of the rain storms, the police said that anyone found sleeping on the underground floors of the covered car park near Emmanuel College would be arrested. This was especially bad news because the subterranean floors are among the most popular spots in the city, with up to 15 people sleeping there. They are warm, quiet and almost safe.</p> <p>Then there are the locked places, which nobody thinks the homeless have a key to. As the weather worsens, the fuller they become. Sam knocks on one of them. \"Bunker, it's Sam,\" he shouts. I can hear faint voices, but nobody responds. \"They won't answer,\" explains Sam. \"The homeless don't believe that anyone would do anything for them. They think you want to steal their sleeping bags. They think you're the police.\" There is a medieval quality about street life here - not just in the way these people live, but in the brute intensity of their fears: money, sex and death, in that order.</p> <p>It is standard for somebody to come on to Sam's wife when they are out begging. \"If you let your girlfriend suck me off, I'll give you a fiver.\" You get that one about every half hour, Sam says. The other day, a man offered her a flat. \"Don't mind about the rent,\" he said. \"Just move in and we'll come to some arrangement.\"</p> <p>He and his wife cannot get work because no employer will take them without an address. They cannot get an address because landlords demand a deposit and a month's payment in advance. They are also finding it difficult to beg, because the government has decreed that begging is bad for the homeless.<br><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Alexander Masters, November 29, 2000.</p> <p><strong>Stranger than fiction</strong><br><em> In 2003, writer and scriptwriter Jonathan Myerson wrote frankly about his experiences as a Labour councillor.

I could be at the British Library, skimming through 18thcentury pamphlets, researching my latest novel. I could be in a cafe chatting to other writers.

So how did I - novelist, screenwriter and father of three, with a life that was comfortably busy enough - end up last year as councillor for Clapham Town ward in Lambeth, south London?</p> <p>Writers are supposed to be solipsistic creatures, engaged only on a single-minded campaign to serve their own creative egos. And, all right, I relish the idea of being (I presume) the only Bafta-winning, Oscar-nominated councillor in the country (Glenda Jackson MP never did local, did she?). But none of that gets you out of bed on a wet and windy Sunday morning to shove leaflets through grimy letterboxes or shake hands door-to-door.</p> <p>You can't do this if you aren't interested in helping people, in making change for the better.

  "<p>This weekend John Bunting will go for a ramble on a hillside near Buxton and will literally dance in the Derbyshire heather with his wife Irene. It will be, he says, one of the most momentous days in a very long life, a celebration of a struggle to allow ordinary people to walk responsibly on land that has been forbidden to them for centuries. The old legs will have a spring in them, the heart will lift and, he says, he might sing a song too. </p> <p>Bunting, 87, is one of the oldest active campaigners for the \"freedom to roam\", which comes into legal effect in the Peak District and the north-west on Saturday. Four years after Labour kept its promise, and the then environment minister Michael Meacher finally steered a watered down version of the original Countryside and Rights of Way Act through parliament, the Ordnance Survey maps for the Peak District have been redrawn, the landowners have mostly accepted the changes, hundreds of new gates and signposts are in place and 100,000 acres of the national park and surrounding areas will be legally open for everyone to walk over, within certain limits. Over the next year, an area the size of Devon will become available to all. </p> <p>Bunting has been fighting for open access to Britain's moors for 70 years, but the campaign goes back much further, to the time of the enclosures in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the emergence of the diggers and levellers and the Labour movement itself. The first bill trying to wrest access to the land back from the landowners was put before parliament in 1884 and presented every year until 1916. Each year it failed. </p> <p>Bunting joined the movement as a footsoldier in 1932, aged 14, in the same year as the famous trespass on Kinder Scout by hundreds of people led by Benny Rothman. </p> <p>\"I started going out to the moors from the time I began working in a Sheffield steelworks. The only time we ever saw the sun was at weekends and in the holiday shutdowns. We so looked forward to getting away from the smoke and the noise. We'd put our bikes over the wall and start walking. Most young people went cycling or walking or fishing. We'd go to the hills and when we came back, all we'd see was a big black pall [of pollution] over Sheffield,\" Bunting recalls. </p> <p>\"I didn't trespass to start with, but I went to my first great access rally at Castleton in 1932. They were all political. The speakers were always Labour MPs and socialists. I remember Barbara Castle and Herbert Morrison talking. We were fighting for national parks by then. We thought if we got those we would get access to the moors, too. We were conned.\" </p> <p>The Peak District moors, on the doorstep of so many northern towns, were a breeding ground for political and social ideas, popular with individual rambling groups, socialists and communists, and youth movements such as the Woodcraft Folk and others. Not everyone trespassed, most preferring to try to work out access agreements with landowners. </p> <p>\"But a lot of us used to trespass individually. It just wasn't right, was it?,\" says Bunting. \"We could never see why all this land should be closed to us just so they could shoot for a few days of the year. They pinched it off us in the first place, didn't they? So we just went out and climbed. We knew we could run faster than the gamekeepers. </p> <p>\"During the war I was in the Home Guard and we used to spend weekends on the moors at firing ranges,\" says Bunting. \"After the war, it was the gamekeepers who had the guns and we were the enemy. Funny that.\" </p> <p>Bunting sat on various access committees after the war and got to know the people who had led the access movement, including GHB Ward, Benny Rothman, Tom Stevenson, Basil Rawson and Bill Keane. The national parks were formed, but scandalously did not give people more rights of access, and, says Bunting, the issue went quiet until the early 1980s when the Ramblers' Association, by then a unified body, got behind the issue. </p> <p>After the 50th anniversary of the Kinder Scout trespasses in 1982, Bunting and like-minded others in Sheffield founded Scam - the Sheffield Campaign for Access to Moorland - one of several direct action groups that worked strategically with the Ramblers' Association to keep the issue on the political agenda and press for legislation. </p> <p>\"The freedom to roam has its roots in the northern working class movement - people like John Bunting who spent Monday to Saturday in pretty horrible conditions,\" explains Nick Barrett, chief executive of the Ramblers' Association. \"Come Sunday, surrounded by some of the most beautiful land in the world, what's more natural than to get out? But they found the land barred to them. It raised the question of who the land belonged to.\" </p> <p>The first world war was the key moment in what could be the longest environment campaign in English social history. \"People came back from the war and here was serious social change. You had the rise of the Labour and communist movements; of women and trade unions; you had the demand for the vote; the depression years. We would not have got this legislation without successive generations saying, 'This is not right. Why can't we go for a walk in our own county?'\" </p> <p>The freedom to roam, as expressed and fought for by the likes of Bunting, is the root of today's environment and conservation movements, says Barrett. \"Underpinning the desire to have the freedom to roam is the concept that if you can physically enjoy something, then you would wish to conserve it. That's why we have a conservation and environment movement. This is probably the last great piece of old Labour legislation.\" </p> <p><strong>Q&amp;A: walking back to happiness</strong></p> <p><strong> What does the new law say?</strong> </p> <p>It will allow walkers to explore away from paths on approximately 4m acres of mountain, moor, heath, down and common land in England and Wales. </p> <p> <strong> Can people go anywhere?</strong> </p> <p>It does not allow people to walk through back gardens or over crops. </p> <p><strong> What can I do on access land?</strong> </p> <p>The law provides a right of access for walkers only. It does not confer any additional rights for cyclists or horse-riders. Dogs are permitted on some areas of open country, but must be kept on a lead on access land between March 1 and July 31, and at any time in the vicinity of livestock. Access at night is permitted, but may be subject to local restrictions. </p> <p><strong> What restrictions are there?</strong> </p> <p>No lighting of fires, using metal detectors, bathing in non-tidal waters, playing organised games or camping, hang-gliding without the permission of the landowner. </p> <p><strong> What happens to walkers who behave irresponsibly?</strong> </p> <p>Anyone who breaks a restriction can be barred from entering the land for the next 72 hours. </p> <p><strong> Will landowners be able to close their land for any reason?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, for up to 28 days a year for any reason. </p> <p><strong> What is open this wekend?</strong> </p> <p>The whole of the Peak District national park, parts of Derbyshire, Staffordshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, all of Greater Manchester and Cheshire, along with Merseyside, most of Lancashire, a small part of Cumbria, and part of North Yorkshire. Places such as Snailsden Moor, Bradfield Moor and Axe Edge Moor, great expanses of moorland, that have been out of bounds for the outward bound for more than 100 years, will be accessible to people on foot. Also areas in the south-east of England. </p> <p>* Other regions will be opened up between December 2004 and November 2005. In Wales, access becomes a reality in the summer of 2005.</p>",
  "<p>When the plight of hefted sheep was raised during the foot and mouth epidemic it brought blank looks to the faces of journalists covering the crisis. But within hours, the hacks had leapt upon the idea of territorial sheep as the story of the day, and the art and practice of hefting was duly explained to readers. </p> <p>With its five minutes of fame now over, hefting has disappeared again into the mountains and moorland from where it came. Meanwhile, hill shepherds are still recovering from the terrible disaster that foot and mouth caused for these very special flocks of sheep, and many fear that unless there is a wider understanding and preservation of their ancient art then Britain's wild areas will change for ever - for the worse. </p> <p>The newly published and informative manual The Practice of Hefting, by Edward Hart, describes hefting as \"the term defining the natural homing instinct of animals, particularly hill sheep, kept under range conditions without fencing. Lambs born on a certain area of hill learn the boundaries of their home ground from their mothers, who had learnt it from their mothers and grandmothers.\" </p> <p>The point about hefting, as Hart points out, is that sheep that stick to their own hillside without the need for fencing allow vast tracks of mountain and moorland to remain unfenced. The sheep graze the hills evenly, preserving the heather, grass and other plants that are so vital to the look of the hills so enjoyed by walkers. </p> <p>But the Ministry of Agriculture's policy of killing all sheep next to a foot and mouth outbreak had a disastrous effect on hefted animals. In the open moor, thousands of sheep that would never have been close to infected cattle were needlessly killed because there was little understanding about the territorial nature of the flocks. </p> <p>Since the culls in 2001, hill shepherds have bought new flocks of sheep, but are now tasked with training them to live on just one patch of hillside. As the manual explains, teaching them not to stray to the sweeter grass in the valleys begins as a full-time occupation. Initially, the shepherds must remain with the sheep constantly, turning them back on to their territory each time they wander. Gradually, the visits can be reduced to two a day and fewer as the sheep begin to settle. </p> <p>Fully hefted sheep will congregate on the highest point in their territory, usually a hilltop where they spend the night to keep away from predators, and then spread out to evenly graze their patch. Although they are semi-wild, they are marked and controlled by shepherds with dogs. </p> <p>Sir John Scott, who hefted blackface sheep on the Lammermuirs, Berwickshire, for 25 years, explains in his foreward to the manual that the ancient practice was developed over hundreds of years, probably by the northern monasteries. Each heft was assessed for its grazing potential relative to the herbage and stock numbers. These were rigourously controlled to get the best out of the available land. Spreading the sheep over large areas minimised the risk of internal parasites through overgrazing or picking up fluke, a flatworm, in boggy areas. </p> <p>But, says Scott, today's difficulty with making a living out of hill farming, particularly with the uncertainties of the reform of the common agricultural policy, mean that hefting is in danger of being lost, and with it the look of the moors and hills. </p> <p>According to Hart, the land where hefting takes place is usually the poorest and the most difficult in the country. Much of it is common land, with 367,000 hectares (906,877 acres) in England, 4% of the total land area, and 183,000 hectares in Wales (8%). More than half of England's common land is in Cumbria and North Yorkshire and half is within national parks. </p> <p>Although commoners and hill farmers are joining forces to try to save their living, the booklet is a plea to a wider audience - not least the environment department and the European Commission - to recognise the value of hefting to the wider community. An important point now that the public is free to roam the mountains and moorlands where hefting has kept the countryside as they enjoy seeing it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Practice of Hefting, by Edward Hart, is free to readers.

  "Tony Blair has called a world scientific conference for next February to decide an upper limit on how much the temperature can rise before the world faces the \"catastrophic consequences of climate change\". <p>He said the idea was to put pressure on the US administration to take action and to include China and India in a programme of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>Speaking last night in London to an audience mainly of business people but including the Prince of Wales and environmental groups, he said global warming \"has become alarming and was simply unsustainable in the long term\". It was not just a question of adjustment. \"I mean a challenge so far-reaching in its impact and irreversible in its destructive power, that it alters radically human existence.\" </p> <p>He said it was not some distant threat centuries ahead. \"I mean in the lifetime of my children certainly; and possibly within my own.\" </p> <p>Even the Kyoto protocol, which the US has repudiated, was insufficient to address the problem of climate change and he would use the presidency of the G8, which he holds next year, to put pressure on the US to rejoin the process and go beyond Kyoto. </p> <p>He said that \"to acquire global leadership on the issue then Britain must demonstrate it first at home\". </p> <p>He announced that sustainable development would be incorporated to every one of the new schools in the current huge building programme. \"It will be in its bricks and mortar and the way the school uses and generates its own power. Our students won't be just told about sustainable development, they will see and work within it: a living learning place in which to explore what a sustainable lifestyle means.\" </p> <p>And in another move to silence critics in the green movement that the prime minister's rhetoric is not matched by action, Mr Blair said building regulations would be changed to make new homes and offices more energy efficient. </p> <p>He said the new Thames Gateway development would be made sustainable in both transport and energy use to demonstrate what was possible with new development. </p> <p>He conceded that while the UK was doing better in reducing greenhouse gases than most countries, it might not be on course for the 20% reduction his government had promised before the last election. Currently it was 14% and rising slightly. As a result, the government would today publish a review of its efforts on targets so far and Margaret Beckett, the environment secretary, was producing a comprehensive five-year plan for the environment this year and sustainable development plan early in 2005 to address shortcomings in the programme. </p> <p>Although Mr Blair referred to nuclear power saying the government would turn to it if necessary, his speech was about technological innovation to start new business and create jobs in renewables. Earlier, he had spent two hours visiting a solar power company, Solar Century, and talking to young people about the need for action on climate change. As a result he said: \"We have been warned. On most issues we ask children to listen to their parents. On climate change, it is parents who should listen to their children. Now is the time to start.\" </p> <p>He said solar panels no longer needed to be large panes placed on the roof of buildings but could be incorporated into windows. </p> <p>Returning to the international theme, he said the UK had demonstrated that economic growth did not have to be at the expense of the environment. Between 1990 and 2002 the UK economy grew by 36% while greenhouse gas emissions fell by around 15%. </p> <p>\"The world's richest nations in the G8 have a responsibility to lead the way: for the strong nations to better help the weak.\" </p> <p>He said Russia was needed to ratify the Kyoto protocol to bring it into effect but that would be only a first step. \"We know there is disagreement over this issue but the US remains a signatory to the climate change convention and recently the US energy secretary and the commercial secretary jointly issued a report accepting the potential damage to the planet through global warming.\" </p> <p>He said the scientific conference in Exeter in February at the Hadley Centre for Climate Change would address \"the big questions\". </p> <p>\"What level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is self evidently too much? What options do we have to avoid such levels?\" </p> <p>Stephen Tindale, director of Greenpeace, said: \"This was an emotional speech which promises strong diplomacy but we need to bring forward the domestic actions to the next three months to give the UK the authority it needs to pull it off.\" </p> <p><b>Prime ministers' promises</b></p> <p><b> Margaret Thatcher</b><br> \"The problem of global climate change is one that affects us all,\" she said in a groundbreaking speech to the UN in November 1989. \"It is no good squabbling over who should pay.\" </p> <p><b> What happened next:</b> In closing the coalmines she indirectly gave the UK a world lead in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and she opened the Hadley Centre for Climate Change, now a world leader. </p> <p><b> John Major</b><br> \"Today we are here, not to argue for a national cause, but for the future of our planet,\" he told the first Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. </p> <p><b> What happened next:</b> The UK signed the UN climate change convention and the biodiversity convention. </p> <p><b> Tony Blair</b><br> \"Earth is the only planet in the solar system with an environment that can sustain life. Our solemn duty as leaders of the world is to treasure that precious heritage,\" he told the UN a month after he took office. </p> <p><b> What happened next:</b> The UK took a leading role in negotiating the 1999 Kyoto agreement on reducing CO2 emissions and undertook a 12.5% cut in UK greenhouse gases. A pledge to cut CO2 emissions by 20% in the 2001 Labour manifesto has since been reduced to an aspiration and is unlikely to be met. </p> <p>At the Earth Summit in September 2002 he restated his commitment but told how the US \"stood outside\" over targets which could damage its economy. </p> <p>Since then CO2 emissions have risen.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Continuous care</strong><br> I find it difficult to believe that the Merseyside initiative to close all its hospitals for mental health patients is in the patients' interests (Towering challenge, September 8). </p> <p>My wife developed severe manic depression three years ago. Until then we were both blissfully ignorant of the problems surrounding mental health and NHS provision. </p> <p>I know nothing of Andrew McCulloch and the Mental Health Foundation, but without acute psychiatric wards I doubt very much that my wife would be here today. Our experience, shared by others I have spoken to, is that it is still far too difficult to gain admission to wards, even when in a desperate state. People die waiting. </p> <p>My wife has spent about a year, in total, in three different hospitals. My newly-acquired experience includes spending hundreds of hours visiting psychiatric wards and getting to know patients and staff. </p> <p>I am unsure what a 24-hour crisis resolution service is going to achieve. Most of the ward patients I met had either severe depression or struggled with delusions. Neither symptoms respond in a day to any treatment available. Antidepressants usually take a month or two to help with moods - and only then can the patient start to come to terms with sorting out their life. During that time suicide is a constant risk. </p> <p>I did my best to be a 24/7 carer, but failed to prevent several suicide attempts, despite devoting my whole time to my wife. I still had to sleep and buy food. My wife's time in hospital gave her continuous care and allowed me time to recover as her carer. I can't see \"up to three weeks of intensive support\" being much use. </p> <p>Anyone with severe mental illness needs 24-hour care, which is best provided in a hospital. The carers are at least as important as the professionals and at present are utterly neglected.

Why does a region need to be defined with landmarks and what is a region anyway? When tourists travel east they go to real places not to the region. </p> <p>I am a great supporter of public art, and have worked at the Tate gallery. At my current place of work I promote a contemporary arts policy. I tend to give any public art the benefit of the doubt, even if it is flawed or unpopular. However, I have a strong reaction against the piece [recreating the lost churches of Dunwich], which looks like several oil rigs or power stations. </p> <p>My great-grandfather was a coastguard at Orford and Dunwich and he would tell strange stories of being on the coast there at night, of hearing the church bells ring and seeing odd lights. I used to walk on that beach and remember his stories, thinking about the lost place. Its whole magic is its hiddenness, its goneness. Its invisibility reminds us of the power of the sea and its inevitable reclamation of the land. </p> <p>I'm an atheist, but I could understand why Christians might consider this monument sacreligious - a kind of stamping of ersatz churches on top of the memory of true places of worship. </p> <p>The best memorials are those that force us to imagine what is missing, such as Rachel Whiteread's Judenplatz memorial or Hoheisel's inverted pyramid invisible under the earth. </p> <p>I would travel back to Dunwich to hear a haunting sound piece that evokes the bells or to walk and talk with a poet or to be invited to draw my idea of the lost village to contribute to an image bank. But I would not travel to see this memorial, as I would feel that a place of my forefathers had been spoiled. </p> <p>The East Anglian coast needs money spent on protection from rising sea levels - the development agency would do better involving creative thinkers to solve that problem.<br><strong>Bridget McKenzie</strong><br>London </p> <p><strong> Nuclear reaction</strong><br> Catherine Mitchell is mistaken in stating that \"nuclear power is largely carbon free\" (Action Stations, September 8). </p> <p>Uranium mining, together with the need to create the concrete and steel for the power stations, demands huge energy inputs so that the first 10 years of the 30-year life cycle of a power station is spent in paying off its carbon debt.

  "<p>The MBA market, after a while in the doldrums, is looking buoyant again, according to Nunzio Quacquarelli, of QS Research, who has just released his annual survey of MBA salaries. Starting salaries for new MBAs have risen 9% this year to $82,000. Further increases in 2005 and 2006 can be expected, claims Mr Quacquarelli. \"All indicators suggest that 2004 is the starting point of another upswing in the MBA hiring cycle.\"</p> <p>This year the QS survey had responses from more than 300 leading international recruiters of MBAs, including McKinsey, Citibank, Lucent and UBS. The survey has been running since 1990 and, until a dip in 2002, it showed a steady growth in earnings for MBAs. Prospects picked up slightly last year, but it is only now that recruiters are significantly improving their offers. The biggest increases are in the fields of financial services and consultants.</p> <p>\"Optimism among MBA recruiters is high and competition is increasing for top talent,\" says Mr Quacquarelli. \"The only cloud on the horizon is the potential impact of further shocks to the global economic system from rising oil prices and global terrorism.\" </p> <p>Earnings vary significantly by sector. For instance, jobs in consumer products and retail pay almost $30,000 less than finance jobs, which offer the largest base salary of $98,000. Consulting is next at $86,000, followed by transport, media and healthcare.</p> <p>Salaries in finance and consulting are almost the same in the US and Europe, which reflects a high level of multi-nationalism in these industries. Rates in technology salaries are also the same, although in general industry they are much higher in the US.</p> <p>And it is not just salaries that help make holders of MBAs feel better off. Nine out of 10 of the big recruiters contacted by Mr Quacquarelli pay bonuses too, and this year they average $19,000. In financial services, bonuses average $42,000 and many investment banks pay $70,000 to $100,000 to first-year MBAs. These bonuses are nearly always tied to performance, and they will not get paid unless the company does well. A new MBA with a shedload of debt from his or her course cannot count on them, and career advisers say they should not take them into account when budgeting and scheduling debt repayments. </p> <p>It is not just Americans who are benefiting from the upturn: European MBA graduates are starting to get richer, too. But MBA salaries in the US are slightly higher, at $85,000 compared to $82,000, although more openings for MBAs are likely to be created in Europe in 2005. The US and western Europe reported very similar average salaries, while Latin America and eastern Europe lag behind. </p> <p>In central Europe, new MBAs generally start on about $30,500 a year, but the cost of living is lower in central Europe than in the US. In Hungary, for example, Mr Quacquarelli calculates than an MBA earning 44% less will still have a higher standard of living than a US graduate. Between starting and finishing an MBA, Europeans can expect to improve their earnings by 118%, he says.</p> <p>Mr Quacquarelli is working on a special survey of UK graduates, expected next month, but UK business schools are cautious about prospects. Elaine Hewens, director of the careers office at Warwick Business School, agrees that the last two years have been slow, and that there are signs that things are looking up. She adds: \"We have got some people going in on sign-on bonuses again.\" But it is not realistic to expect to switch careers, do a year-long MBA, and walk out with a massive salary increase, she says. Some people do go out and earn perhaps \u00a320,000 more than before, but this is the exception, not the rule, and it depends as much on previous work experience as on the MBA.</p> <p>\"There's too much focus on salaries and not enough on career options,\" she says. \"There are many more options now than before. The MBA gives you a huge amount in terms of personal development.\" </p> <p>At the Association of MBAs, the London-based accrediting organisation, officials are starting work on their own salary survey, to be released just before Christmas. The association's last survey of UK MBA graduates, released in January 2003, showed a 31% salary hike, but AMBA's Paula Glason worries that the US market may still be overheated, and there is a question mark over whether salaries will continue to rise. </p> <p>For the moment, the recurrent rumours that the MBA bubble is about to burst seem to be confounded by the QS survey. But despite Mr Quacquarelli's habitual optimism, the old image of the MBA as an automatic path to riches should be viewed with considerable caution.</p>",
  "Graduates in the UK still command significantly higher salaries than those without degrees, despite the recent expansion in higher education, international education experts said yesterday. <p>The annual education overview from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development finds that British graduates earn 59% more than non-graduates, one of the highest degree premiums in the OECD. </p> <p>The report, Education at a Glance, concludes that fears that the dramatic global rise in graduate numbers over the last decade would lead to \"qualifications inflation\" hitting the earnings benefit of a degree are unfounded. </p> <p>Even in countries with far higher university entry rates than the UK, including Australia and Sweden, where more than 70% of the population goes into higher education, graduate salaries are holding steady or increasing, the study has found. </p> <p>There is also no evidence that the expansion in student numbers has led to a decline in degree quality, according to the OECD education statistics chief, Andreas Schleicher. </p> <p>Given the \"rate of return\" for both individuals and countries, there was \"no upper limit\" on the potential proportion of graduates in a country, he said. The findings will provide ammunition for ministers in defending the government's controversial target of 50% entry to higher education, which has been criticised by business leaders and the Conservatives amid claims that Britain does not need so many graduates. </p> <p>Criticisms have been fuelled by the UK's woeful record in keeping teenagers at school after 16 - also highlighted in the OECD report. </p> <p>However, despite an increase of more than 20% in student numbers in less than 10 years, the UK's total of 47% of school leavers entering university is still below the OECD average of 51%, though low dropout rates mean the numbers actually completing their degrees are well above the norm. </p> <p>Other findings in the report, based on 2002 data, are more troubling for Britain. </p> <p>The UK has lost its place at the top of the graduation-rate league, slipping behind Australia, Finland, Hungary, Iceland and Poland. </p> <p>The study also confirms that Britain is facing increasingly fierce international competition for overseas students. The UK's share of the total \"market\" in students from abroad fell from 16% in 1998 to 12% in 2002, though overall foreign student numbers in Britain rose by 18,000 to 227,272 over the four years amid a 34% increase in foreign enrolment. </p> <p>Any indication that Britain is losing its global reputation as a favoured student destination is alarming for universities, which rely on the substantial fees paid by overseas students, and for the government, which backs aggressive international recruitment with an eye on the economic returns involved. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills said yesterday that other countries had sought to emulate the UK's success in attracting foreign students. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"The UK has more than held its own, but the cake has got bigger. We have every intention of remaining one of the most popular destinations for overseas students.\" </p> <p>The British Council, which this year called for substantial investment in UK higher education to reap the benefits of an expanding international student market, insisted that more recent figures than those used by the OECD would show Britain recovering ground. </p> <p>The council's education export manager, Nick Butler, said: \"The market is growing, and the UK's figures are growing quite substantially, but none of the major traditional players are going to maintain their market share.\" </p> <p>As in previous years, the OECD study exposes the UK's internationally poor performance in tackling the high numbers failing to secure basic secondary qualifications - equivalent to five GCSEs at A* to C. The UK is in 22nd place out of the 30 OECD countries for the 25-34 age group, but 13th for those aged 55-64, who completed their education some 40 years ago. </p> <p>The DfES yesterday said the government had introduced a range of measures to tackle underachievement and low staying-on rates, including a planned overhaul of 14-19 qualifications and maintenance grants for low-income sixth formers.</p> <p><b>Worldly wise</b></p> <p><b> Percentage of population entering higher education in 2002 across the OECD</b> </p> <p><b> Australia</b> 77% </p> <p><b> Sweden</b> 75% </p> <p><b> Iceland </b> 72% </p> <p><b> Finland </b> 71% </p> <p><b> Poland</b> 70% </p> <p><b> New Zealand</b> 66% </p> <p><b> United States</b> 64% </p> <p><b> Hungary</b> 62% </p> <p><b> Netherlands</b> 53% </p> <p><b> Denmark</b> 50% </p> <p><b> Italy</b> 50% </p> <p><b> Spain</b> 50% </p> <p><b> Korea</b> 49% </p> <p><b> United Kingdom </b> 47% </p> <p><b> Slovak Republic</b> 44% </p> <p><b> Japan</b> 41% </p> <p><b> Ireland</b> 39% </p> <p><b> France</b> 37%</p>",
  "<p>Sri Lanka are second in the one-day rankings and have lost only once in 18 matches. Those are statistics enough for England to be wary of Friday's Rose Bowl decider that will determine which of them reaches the Champions Trophy semi-final. </p> <p>But there is another side to Sri Lanka, a side who struggle to adjust to English conditions, especially if there is drizzle on a nasty wind. This was the team on show in an awkward four-wicket win, with 37 balls to spare, against a Zimbabwe who England, not at their best, had already exposed as ing\u00e9nues. </p> <p>There were fleeting moments when one wondered if Zimbabwe might nick it. The Champions Trophy is finally warming up - not boiling point perhaps, but at least the temperature of a doorstep pint on a hot summer's morning. </p> <p>If Sri Lanka struggled on the Oval's flatlands, even flatlands slightly spiced by drizzle, then they are unlikely to prosper at the Rose Bowl, where the bounce is variable. Yet this remains a Sri Lanka that can be inspired by one uppercut from Sanath Jayasuriya or one inswinger from Chaminda Vaas. </p> <p>\"It wasn't our prettiest win,\" admitted the captain Marvan Atapattu. \"It takes time to adjust but we have got such a small amount of time. We need more application.\" </p> <p>Sri Lanka had designs on beating Zimbabwe quickly enough to pass England on net run rate - so ensuring they reach the semi-final if their head-to-head is washed out. Even when Zimbabwe had transformed 85 for six into 191, Sri Lanka's task of winning within 27.5 overs was not impossible. But at 10 for two they decided just to win it. </p> <p>From tomorrow the group stages conclude with Australia v New Zealand, England v Sri Lanka, South Africa v West Indies and India v Pakistan. That is more than good fortune for a tournament that needs all the good fortune it can get, it is creative planning. The seedings were based on ODI rankings - but the date when those rankings were assessed was shrewdly chosen. </p> <p>When Zimbabwe were six down for 85, outdone by slick catching, yesterday's game felt like another mismatch. Even the gaggle of Sri Lankan spectators seemed leftovers from series past, right down to the man shivering in a T-shirt promoting the London \"chicken 'n ribs\" restaurant that caused such a furore when it illegally sponsored Arjuna Ranatunga's bat back in '97. </p> <p>But Zimbabwe batted defiantly when the cause seemed lost. Elton Chigumbura's build creates the delusion that he is among the most senior of their new breed. In fact he is only 18, but he extended the good impression created against England with a pugnacious half-century and three wickets. </p> <p>These Zimbabweans deserve a nod of respect. They might be the representatives of a deceitful board which has engineered a dispute of racist undertones with its white players. They might also be accused of legitimising Robert Mugabe's malevolent, tyrannical regime. But in cricketing terms they are guileless young men who have been thrust into the international arena and who have shown impressive spirit in adversity. Do not deny them that.</p>",
  "At this week's TUC, I have experienced deja vu and an odd sense of dislocation. Despite the flatness of Blair's speech and its tepid reception, most headlines reflect the trade union-government relationship as it ever was: the big guns battling, men in suits squaring up to each other. So far, so familiar. But is it? <p>Beneath the muted seaside wrangle over honouring the Warwick warranty and the direction of the next Labour government, something much more interesting is happening within the union and the wider labour movement. Over the past few decades, both party and unions have been revolutionised by the involvement of women in politics. </p> <p>For New Labour, this has resulted in a generation of mid-ranking women in parliament and government, politicised by feminism and then by their experience of power, pressing on a wide range of issues relating to women's lives. For the trade unions, the change has more of the flavour of an emergency. With the dwindling of its traditional membership - put crudely, full-time men in manufacturing - has come a potentially vast new membership: part-time women working in the service sector. </p> <p>Different kinds of workers, very different patterns of employment. But workers needing protection and representation all the same. Even this week, trade union leaders talk of this sea-change uncertainly, seeing in it something between a crisis and an opportunity. The result of these seismic shifts is a new agenda that keeps moving towards political centre stage; a substantive list of policy demands that has yet to be matched by a shift in political style - at leadership level, at least. High on the list is the campaign against the culture of long hours. </p> <p>Since trade unionism began, cutting working time has been its priority. In the modern era of global capital, large corporations have encouraged flexible working as a way of keeping the new supply of women workers happy in their part-time, low-status jobs. But the call for a fair and flexible working life, geared more to family life, has a genuine urgency now. There's a generation of younger workers - men and women - who don't want their lives shredded by the demands of employment. </p> <p>Equal pay has also taken a suprising hike up the political agenda. As the GMB's Kevin Curran argued this week, the gender pay gap is a \"huge issue\" for many of his members, a change reflected in Blair's July announcement of a new equal pay commission. </p> <p>Add to these issues the potent new significance of childcare; campaigns for greater economic support for families in their early years; the politics of pensions; continuing campaigns on domestic violence and child protection. All this amounts to a new dimension in mainstream political life - one with real popular backing. But the question is: where is the reflection of all this at the highest level of labour politics? The answer is not straightforward. It's more a question of now you see it, now you don't. </p> <p>Scan the TUC timetable for this week, and many of these issues are honourably present. Skip forward to the Labour party conference later this month, and one of the first fringe meetings will ask: has Labour delivered for women? There will be talk aplenty about gender. But all this excitement and effort has yet to be translated into a genuine shift in style, substance and spending. </p> <p>Government, party and unions are stuffed with good sorts, men aged from 30 to 60 who can talk the hind leg off a donkey about work-life balance or the unfairness of pension arrangements on women, or the crucial place of childcare in the modern economy. Long ago, Tony Blair was considered one of these. Gordon Brown in his remote way is still considered a friend of feminism. Alan Milburn's decision to choose family over political career put him firmly among the gender modernisers; even now, he is still talked about as a keen advocate of equality. </p> <p>But if gender issues are no longer dismissed out of hand, they are still treated as second rank. Like Milburn and his family, it's as if the \"soft\" stuff is important until something else, like real political power, comes along. But soft may just be the new hard. Or it should be. Fairer pay, fairer pensions, more investment in the early years; truly domestic issues may well be the way to the electorate's reluctant heart, as Blair acknowledged. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Polly Toynbee made a strong case for building a third-term manifesto around the idea of a children's centre in every constituency; the political focus of a new constellation of values. So far, there's no sign of the political will or the real money to do so. But perhaps this is not surprising, coming from a government that has made so little public noise about some of its substantive achievements on the eradication of child poverty. </p> <p> It's all rather a pity and a waste, given that support for New Labour is declining among the 35- to 54-year-old age group. Among its natural constituency - younger women and working-class women - there's a reluctance to come out and vote. For them, New Labour still means business as usual. The trade unions face a similar demographic crisis. They too need to make more of issues that matter to the new workforce; not just on pay and time, but what Kevin Curran rather graphically describes as \"a very, very biased view of women at work at every level\". </p> <p>There have been heroic efforts to reach out and meet the concerns of the new constituencies, but the top of the unions, like that of government, remains safely in the hands of fiftysomething men. Government and unions have more in common than they think: they face a common crisis in terms of their natural supporters. </p> <p>The next few years offer them a chance to show those supporters, and the public, that they - like the nation and the economy - have been transformed by women's greater participation in public life; and that political structures and priorities have kept pace with that monumental change. The failure to do so could signal the death knell of labour, old and new.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mbenn@dircon.co.uk\">mbenn@dircon.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Jonathan Freedland argues that the prime minister is \"a man who has run out of ideas\" (Tony Blair's survival is an affront to our constitution, September 11). <p>The struggle in the Labour party is not about Tony Blair's lack of ideas. It is down to a refusal by many in the party to accept them. The one big idea for Labour was espousing \"the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition\", written down as a new core principle in clause four. Yet when policy makers argue in favour of relying on such forces, many of the party faithful cry foul. </p> <p>There are lots more examples of the new vision: fairness but no favours for the unions; accepting the global economy as a reality; politics of the centre and so on. </p> <p>Now Freedland argues that \"every day [Blair] remains [as leader] is an affront to the constitution\". Yet his argument only concerns the opinions of people in the party. Blair was chosen by the electorate, on a set of principles and policies presented in clear terms. To seek to remove the prime minister now would be a far greater affront to our constitution.<br> <b> Mike Allott</b><br> Eastleigh, Hants </p> <p>Such is the glory of the unwritten British constitution that Blair can quite legitimately believe the only way he can be turfed out of Downing Street is by allowing Michael Howard in. Any other exit strategy would be an affront to the man's pride and vanity. </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland, a great admirer of so many things American, must look longingly across the Atlantic at the 22nd amendment of the US constitution, which states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.\" If that sensible guard against dictatorship was the case here, who would not be celebrating as the clock ticked down on Blair's premiership?<br> <b> Rick Bryant</b><br> Exeter, Devon </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland rightly exposes the constitutional cracks that have enabled our prime minister to evade accountability for the war in Iraq. An impotent opposition in parliament, a subservient judiciary, a useless church, a cowardly media and a cynical Labour party have allowed this country to go to war not just on one lie, but a lot of lies. I am amazed that people are not taking to the streets in outrage at this shabby and shameful misgovernment. </p> <p>But there's one more plank of the constitution that Freedland didn't mention: we, the people. An election is not the answer: we might want to vote Labour, but we don't want to vote for this prime minister. The only way left is to take to the streets and demonstrate and to do it soon. Remember the WI?<br> <b> Gillian Gunner</b><br> Sherborne, Dorset </p> <p>At last a senior journalist is showing his mettle. Freedland's article, like most of his comments, reminds me of the old fearless Guardian of liberal values. Britain is approaching a totalitarian state by consent. In such a state there is no oppression, no political prisoners and no visible dissent. Every citizen and every institution is in a zombified acquiescence, morally ambivalent, intellectually philistine and thoroughly mean.<br> <b> Yousef Abdulla</b><br> Orpington, Kent </p> <p>It is Jonathan Freedland's elitism, not Tony Blair's premiership, that is \"an affront to our constitution\". He dislikes Blair, and so do the \"mandarins\", \"the establishment including the judiciary\", and \"the press\". Freedland's argument is clear. Leave politics to the elite, because you can't trust the people.<br> <b> Hugh Bayley MP</b><br> Lab, City of York</p>"
