  "<p>Millwall really should get away more often. Last month's close-season tournament in Vancouver not only provided the FA Cup finalists with competitive games in a decent environment, it also allowed them to turn up one of the game's most inspired signings since Aston Villa brought Dwight Yorke back from a trip to Tobago 15 years ago. </p> <p>Adrian Serioux, 25, featured in Team Canada's midfield against the Millwall tourists last month while the midfielder Josh Simpson, 21, appeared at left-back. Both impressed the south Londoners enough for them quickly to agree to pay up Serioux's contract at Toronto Lynx and sound out the University of Portland student before handing both two-year deals. </p> <p>On Saturday the club got their first return as Serioux and the other permanent signing of the summer, Jody Morris, combined to put them on the way to a first win of the season and inflict a first defeat on Leicester. </p> <p>The three points went a long way to silencing the where's-the-money-gone brigade, impatient to spend some of the \u00a32.5m proceeds of the FA Cup run and the \u00a31.5m for Tim Cahill . They had aimed their bile at the chairman Theo Paphitis before, during and after the midweek defeat by Wigan. </p> <p>Serioux had the same fans eating out of his hand after two minutes of his debut, however, when he took a throw from level with the penalty area and hurled it to the back post, where Ian Walker did well to keep out Mark McCammon's header. </p> <p>His next throw reached the same spot and earned huge applause when it was bundled away and the third, from 50 yards, cleared a defender and Danny Dichio at the front post and was turned in by Morris. </p> <p>\"I can pretty much put it on someone's head if I want to. I have that accuracy,\" said Serioux, a matter-of-fact Canadian with Trinidadian parents. \"I've never measured it but I can throw from inside the halfway line to the six-yard box. I just practised and practised.\" </p> <p>Simpson spent his early teens honing his skills at the British Columbia academy run by the former Millwall striker Derek Possee and made his impact almost as quickly, with two intelligent runs and some timely interventions at left-back. </p> <p>\"We are very happy with both boys,\" purred Ray Wilkins, Millwall's assistant manager. \"They play in the right manner too, because they want to win.\" </p> <p>There was little danger of failing to do so in a game which Dennis Wise, who has an unfair dismissal claim ongoing against Leicester, made his first start of the season and then saw his team engage in a running battle of a first half ending in a tunnel incident, denied by both clubs, at half-time. </p> <p>Leicester's best chance fell to Jamie Scowcroft soon into the second half but once Dichio had fastened on to Wise's through-ball and finished with his right it was left for Stefan Moore to miss a couple of one-on-ones and later go to ground after a saving tackle by Chris Makin, who was harshly sent off. </p> <p>Serioux and Simpson were in Vancouver yesterday before a World Cup qualifier against Guatemala on Wednesday but will be back for the trip to Coventry. \"We hope they travel safely,\" added Wilkins, aware the pair have bought them time and saved a lot of money. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match: </strong> Adrian Serioux (Millwall)</p>",
  "<p>NEW SEASON, SAME OLD STORY?</p> <p>Last season was, by common consent, the most tedious Premiership ever. Arsenal romped to the title by March, the relegation places were done and dusted by mid-April, and just about everybody else settled on a cosy mediocrity long before the Gunners' loyal club captain Patrick Vieira finally lifted the trophy. Will this year be any different? Well, the Fiver's not holding it's breath (which is just as well, because come next May we'd be dead).</p> <p>We do still have high hopes that Chelsea might give it a proper go this year - particularly seeing as Jose Mourinho has shown: a) the wiles to rile Sir Alex Ferguson by comically flicking the Vs at Old Trafford last March, b) the talent to win the Euro Vase and Big Cup in successive seasons. But yesterday, his defensiveness against Manchester United's reserves would have made even the Internazionale sides of the mid-60s blush.</p> <p>And then there's United - who, without Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Cristiano Ronaldo, look as potent as a Viagra placebo. And, sadly for their fans, there's no Wayne Rooney on the cards either, with the club's directors having decided that Diego Forlan and David Bellion can support Alan Smith in the short term. Throw in Liverpool, whose manager Rafa Benitez took both his front line strikers off half-way through the second half against Spurs, and we could be left with just one really attack-minded side in the higher echelons of the Premiership.

First off there's poor Berti Vogts, whose ever-diminishing Scotland squad is starting to looking thinner than a dieting Kate Moss breathing in.</p> <p>After losing Christian Dailly yesterday, Jackie McNamara (ankle), Steve Caldwell (groin), Paul Dickov (Achilles) and Kevin Kyle (hip) have all pulled out today - and Nigel Quashie, Richard Hughes and Colin Cameron all remain doubtful for Wednesday night's friendly against Hungary. \"It all looks very, very positive,\" said Vogts, carefully positioning Jimmy Krankie on his tactics board. Things aren't quite so bad for Sven-Goran Eriksson, whose new-look England side has remained intact apart from the withdrawal of Chelsea's Wayne Bridge. A greater cynic than the Fiver might suggest Jose's got a touch of the Fergies already, but we swallow, sorry, believe the line about a calf injury causing him some discomfort; and Sven's too busy fretting about only having six subs to care.</p> <p>And just when you thought you'd heard the last of Harry Kewell's Australia career, he today moved to reassure everyone that, like Carole King, they just have to call his name, and he'll be there - and that includes the big ones. \"I have always said I will be there for Australia when it matters,\" he whined into a loudhailer, \"and that applies for the Solomon Islands matches\".</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * </p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>American international full back Tony Sanneh is in talks with Coventry City according to the player's agent.

  "<p>Truancy is more prevalent among teenage girls than boys in Scotland, according to a report today. </p> <p>Academics at Edinburgh University found only one in five truants at primary school were girls but the corresponding figure in the third year of secondary school was three in five. </p> <p>The study found boys were more likely to be excluded from school than girls, making up almost three quarters of the third year total. </p> <p>One of the most disturbing findings was that half of all 15-year-old truants in the study reported using drugs during the last 12 months. </p> <p>Research from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime tracks the 4,300 young people who transferred to secondary schools in Edinburgh in autumn 1998. </p> <p>It examined truancy, parenting, gender and victimisation among young people and looked at the links to delinquent and criminal behaviour. </p> <p>Girls were found to be involved in certain forms of delinquency, such as theft from home, graffiti and truancy, more than boys. But more serious forms of delinquency, such as carrying a weapon, housebreaking and robbery, were far more common among boys than girls. </p> <p>David Smith, professor of criminology at Edinburgh University, said children's behaviour was shaped in the home. </p> <p>\"Put simply, the findings show that good parenting can prevent crime,\" Professor Smith said. </p> <p>\"By contrast, parents who are inconsistent and harsh, and who easily give in to unreasonable demands, are more likely to see their teenage children turn to delinquency. </p> <p>\"The reports also demonstrate the influence of a wide range of other factors, from socio-economic status to the community and environment young people grow up in. </p> <p>\"But peers and parents have an important influence on top of these external factors.\" </p> <p>The study found the young people who experienced the most victimisation reported committing an average of one offence per week, compared with one every two months for non-victims. </p> <p>At the age of 13 it reported 40% of girls had sprayed graffiti on property in the last 12 months, compared with 29% of boys. </p> <p>But at the age of 15 boys were three times more likely than girls to carry a weapon and twice as likely to be involved in a fight. </p> <p>The type of parenting children receive aged 12 to 13 predicts their level of delinquency at the age of 15, according to the research.</p>",
  "<p>\"Writing a CV is like eating an elephant. You have to do it chunk by chunk,\" says Margaret Stead, CEO of careers consultancy careersnet.com. She feels that all too often we take a daunting, one size fits all approach to compiling a CV. </p> <p>\"You're reluctant to get round to it, you make a half-hearted attempt and once you've got something you use it for absolutely everything.\" Sound familiar? Well, you're not alone, but you're not doing yourself any favours either. When it comes to CVs, the key is to make it relevant. </p> <p>Ms Stead recommends that rather than writing a generic chronological CV, you should build up a portfolio of achievements. When applying for a job, identify the achievements that demonstrate skills your potential employer is looking for and then match approximately five from your portfolio. </p> <p>If you're going for your first job, you might not feel you have five achievements under your belt, but it can be just a question of looking at your experience in the right way. \"Lots of students undersell themselves,\" says John Richardson, careers consultant at Manchester University and Umist. \"When they say they've done nothing you want to scream at them. You've worked in a bar on a Saturday night in Manchester? You've got experience handling conflict.\" Make sure, though, that you tailor your experience to make it relevant to the job in question.</p> <p>The same applies to any attempt to make your CV stand out from the crowd. When it comes to quirky touches, \"do it for a reason,\" says Nic Owen, account director at advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi. \"We occasionally get CVs somehow put into food... generally they stink or they're sodden. It's awful. If there's a reason for it then it can be powerful but gimmicks for their own sake are annoying.\" </p> <p>Ms Stead fondly remembers a CV that turned up with a teabag attached and an invitation to \"have a cup of tea while you read my CV!\" But she agrees that you can't rely on the person who reads your CV sharing your sense of humour. As a general rule, Stead says, tricks like printing your CV on neon yellow paper are \"wrong, wrong, wrong.\" </p> <p>If your CV is going into a business environment it should look appropriate. \"Buy the best quality paper you can afford and keep it white or cream. What really stands out is lots of white space, consistent formatting and a smart font. Or post your CV online and email the link to the employer\".</p> <p>\"Make sure it's accurate,\" says Mr Richardson, \"and don't rely on spellcheck.\" It sounds obvious but employers say you'd be surprised how many mistakes they see on CVs. Ms Stead promises she has seen both \"am a perfectionist and rarely if if ever forget details\" and \"received a plague for salesperson of the year\" on genuine CVs. As for layout, \"just set out the best parts of you, in an easily digestible way,\" says Mr Owen. Bullet points are good way to keep things clear and focussed.</p> <p>What about length? Must you keep everything on one page? Is it OK to stretch to three? Mr Richardson feels that two pages are pretty standard for the UK, and that busy recruiters won't read anything much longer than that. \"The key is to be pithy\" says Mr Owen, \"I saw a CV recently that was so simple. It was about 10 lines long. Just: I went to this university, I'm interested in these things, I want to work in advertising for these reasons. It was very impressive.\"</p> <p>Should you include one of those increasingly popular personal mission statements? \"I absolutely hate those things,\" Mr Owen continues. \"What frustrates me is that they're all the same. Everyone's passionate, ambitious, organised... well-endowed. There's no differentiation.\" Despite the trend, this seems to be a representative view. If it's generic and not directly relevant, then leave it out. </p> <p>As for the dreaded \"other interests\" section, there is just no right answer. Ms Stead feels that unless you can somehow match it to their requirements, you might as well leave it out. On the other hand Mr Richardson knows one particular company who looks there first, to find out how well-rounded you are. The thing to do here is take your cue from the company. Read the ad very carefully, look at their website and make a call about the best way to connect what you have to say with what they would like to hear.</p> <p>With all this, you're probably running out of space. The good news is that you don't need to include references. It's perfectly acceptable to put \"references available on request\" at the bottom. And before you give out a referee's details, make sure they know they're likely to be contacted, what job you're going for and what sort of questions they're likely to be asked. You could even suggest some possible answers. </p> <p>Throughout the process, it's likely that you have been wrestling with the tone of the whole thing. How do you sell yourself properly without sounding like an arrogant idiot? Mr Richardson recommends what he calls the CAR model: \"Context, action, results. Say what the situation was, what you did about it and what happened. Focus on the facts and they will speak for themselves.\" </p> <p>Mr Owen thinks humour can help. He says it's important to let your personality come across. \"People think they have to be so serious. You shouldn't be flippant, but the best CVs are the ones where you warm to the person. In the end you just have to be yourself. If you lie about who you are now and get the job, you will have to be that person for the rest of your career.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> It's a wonder I can type at all. My whole body has gone into sympathetic shock after reading about the woman who's given birth to a 13 1/ 2 lb baby, and I am having to take sustaining sips of hot, sweet tea while I try to wipe this unwelcome information from my mind. While I try not to think of something twice the normal size of something already ridiculously ill-designed for its chosen method of entry into the world. While I try not to laugh hysterically at my mother, who insists that the excruciating pain fades into nothingness once you hold your (10-ton or otherwise) infant for the first time. Nothing is worth that kind of pain, woman, nothing. She is simply bombarding me with untruths because she can see her chances of grandmotherhood receding yet further into the Microgynon-strewn distance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pity the poor graduates. The Higher Education Statistics Agency says that around 40% of the BA-honoured are finding it difficult to get work that is worthy of the time, money and effort they put in to getting their degrees. Some have even - and I hope you're sitting down for this, unless you've recently given birth to a monster baby, as this would simply compound your difficulties - become traffic wardens, hospital porters, road sweepers and tractor drivers. Or, as the HESA terms them \"the elementary occupations.\" </p> <p>I do love a euphemism that fairly reeks of late-night gubernatorial blood, sweat and tears shed in the service of political correctness. As a non-driving, non-childbearing entity, I like to pretend that my taxes are spent on the salaries of people employed solely to scour Roget's Thesaurus and compose descriptions incapable of causing offence even to the most sensitive, muesli-fuelled liberal soul, instead of being used to polish roads and buff schools to a high shine, which aideth me not. </p> <p>I suspect that what happens is that graduates leave their educational establishment believing that the employment angels will descend on them bearing an array of golden job opportunities, from which they may pick the choicest morsels and bestow upon the lucky employer the majesty and wonder of their overqualified presences. And that they are then more than slightly perturbed to note that the process is more like a cattle market run by lottery and after six months of panicking and having an average of \u00a312,000 worth of debt hanging over them, take whatever they can get. Thus are the bubbles of post-adolescent arrogance pricked, to the amusement of us all. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>New research by those fearless investigators at Dove Body Wash has revealed that women habitually endure a worse start to the day than men. Over two-thirds of female workers reckoned that their pre-commute regime of washing up, tidying the house, dressing and feeding the kids, regrouting the bathroom, tiling the roof, polishing the doorknobs, donkeystoning the step, landscaping the garden and solving global warming left them flustered and stressed by the time they arrived at work. The average woman carried out 16 tasks before leaving home (about one every 4.35 minutes) while men did 11. And given that men included in their definition of the word \"task\" things like listening to the radio and reading the newspapers (presumably they are also exhausted from the arduous labours of sleeping and farting), I think we can all safely assume that the gender divide is alive and kicking and probably stealing all the bedclothes to boot. </p> <p>Not content with merely amassing data, the intrepid Dove contingent hired psychologist Dr Aric Sigman to explain the results. According to the good doctor, \"A woman's brain allows her to polyphase - multi-tasking using different parts of her brain, especially the emotional circuits, to deal with the tasks at hand.\" Are you still with me? Good. \"In contrast, men are biologically designed to be 'selfish', making them much better at indulging in some time for themselves in the morning. For a man, the neurological process is less complex and less emotional. Thousands of years ago this guilt-free single-mindedness was vital for hunter-gatherers whose lives depended on the ability to concentrate on providing and protecting.\" </p> <p>Hmm. Replace the word \"polyphase\"with \"factor in the existence of other individuals within the immediate vicinity\", take out the quotation marks round \"selfish\" and add \"But times change and now the irony is that your wife is about to beat you to death with a club for the traits which once ensured your survival\" and I would entirely agree.</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices today eased back from a run of record highs after Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, declared victory in a national referendum on his presidency. </p> <p>As the prospect of political uncertainly in the world's fifth largest oil-producing country receded, the cost of a barrel of crude peaked at a 21-year high of $46.91 (\u00a325.43) in New York before dipping back to $46.21.</p> <p>Prices fell after results released by the Venezuelan electoral authorities showed the charismatic Mr Ch\u00e1vez had survived a referendum aimed at toppling him with 94% of the vote counted. </p> <p>The result came as a relief to the markets amid worries about disruptions to oil exports had a disputed result sparked social unrest. There had been fears that if Mr Ch\u00e1vez had lost, pro-Ch\u00e1vez oil workers might have disrupted production of an estimated at 2.6m barrels per day, but shipments from Venezuela were reported to be running smoothly.</p> <p>\"There are lots of concerns in the oil market now, like the Iraqi situation and Opec's thin spare capacity, but for today the market is focusing on the Venezuela vote,\" Tony Nunan, a manager at Mitsubishi Corp's international petroleum business, told the Reuters news agency. </p> <p>Prices hit record highs on a daily basis last week, and Opec is pumping oil at record levels, straining to keep up with high demand in the US and China. </p> <p>The lack of spare capacity, fears of terrorist attacks, disruptions to Iraqi crude exports and financial troubles at Russia's largest oil producer, Yukos, have made the market highly jittery, with speculation also helping to push up prices. </p> <p>In the UK, motorists have been warned to expect forecourt prices to stay above 80p a litre for the foreseeable future. Air passengers have also felt the impact of higher oil prices as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have increased fuel surcharges.</p> <p>The price of oil has soared more than 30% in the past 12 months. In real terms, taking into account inflation, prices are still well below 1980's peak of $80, following the Iranian revolution. But they have surpassed those of 1974, the first oil shock, when crude averaged an inflation-adjusted $43 during the Arab oil embargo. </p> <p>A slowdown in the global economy, which would ease demand for oil, is one of the few things that could take the pressure off prices. In a report Friday, economists at JP Morgan said the risks that the global economy will enter \"an extended soft patch are rising.\"</p>",
  "<p>I am descending in the lift in the plush, marble-clad interior of a five-star hotel in Qatar to rejoin an international conference which is ostensibly about Arab media versus the west but which has turned into something like a old-style Labour party conference, with tedious speech after speech. </p> <p>The lift stops at the third floor and an Arab gentleman steps in. \"Are you enjoying the conference?\" he asks. \"Yes,\" I reply politely, not wishing to offend in case he is an executive from al-Jazeera which is, after all funding the forum. </p> <p>\"I hate al-Jazeera,\" he declares, baffling me. And so the most illuminating discussion of my first morning in Qatar begins. With a man who has nothing to do with the channel but who has plenty of opinions about it. </p> <p>\"It's full of Palestinians,\" he snorts. \"And they supported Saddam,\" he adds for good measure. At this point I start to laugh incredulously. I know al-Jazeera will never be flavour of the month with Rumsfeld or Bush but it is packed with ex-BBC staff and I hadn't expected such venom from its own quarters. </p> <p>I linger in conversation to hear him enthusiastically explain that he is half Saudi and half Kuwaiti and the Saudis don't like al-Jazeera because it's sowing unrest in the Gulf region. </p> <p>It was a theme that was to crop up again and again in my brief stay in Qatar - later in the conference a newscaster stood up to reveal that he is the only Saudi reporter at the station and that sometimes he feels as if he has committed treason.\"Joining al-Jazeera was an act against my own country.\" </p> <p>To an untutored eye like mine, it is easy to assume that al-Jazeera reflects a uniform Arab perspective, but it doesn't, and al-Jazeera is long-accustomed to attacks from Arab regimes and people like my man in the lift who think the station serves as a platform for terrorists and suicide bombers. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia and Tunisia are particularly hostile to al-Jazeera, which has been operating for eight years, and they have banned it from operating bureaux there. </p> <p>\"Many [Arab] governments don't mind having correspondents from al-Jazeera, as long as they concentrate on tourism or cultural affairs, but as soon as you talk about something that is a problem, you become an irritant,\" said al-Jazeera presenter Mohammed Krechan, before adding that the western press simply did not know what it was like to operate in such a hostile environment. </p> <p>\"It's like being one rat and being chased by several cats. Arab governments are running like a cat running after the rat, but then there is another big cat - the west,\" adds Krechan. </p> <p>\"The Saudis, the Tunisians, don't want anything to do with these channels,\" he said. \"But among the Palestinians, the Lebanese, the Egyptians, Libya and Iraqis, there is an acceptance that you have to play the game. In Saudi, there is a complete shutdown in the interior and exterior level. These are countries that are closed from inside.\" </p> <p>The Saudis haven't just singled out al-Jazeera - the BBC has also been banned from having a permanent presence in the kingdom until late last year, when they finally relented, although the office has yet to open as the BBC reviews the security situation in the wake of the killing of cameraman Simon Cumbers in a shoot-out in Riyadh.The hostilities between Saudi and al-Jazeera partly stem from historic border rows - one Gulf journalist privately described the relationship as similar to that of Iraq and Kuwait - but it seems that it is more than that: al-Jazeera has now become the envy of the entire Arab world. </p> <p>In just a few years the Emir has established an international reputation for Qatar in a way that a bigger and more powerful neighbour could never have imagined, and some feel that the Saudis have squandered the opportunity they once had to establish themselves as leaders in the Arab media world in the way that the BBC is considered one of the most important news-gatherers in the west. </p> <p>\"Al-Jazeera is an international force on a par with CNN and BBC News now. Eight years ago, nobody had ever heard of Qatar, now everyone has. Al-Jazeera has put Qatar on the map. I would go so far as to say it is like an army to Qatar, it shields it from criticism. Before, countries like Egypt could say what they liked about Qatar; now they are more reluctant because they know it will be reported on an independent news channel owned by Qatar,\" a Palestinian journalist who operates news agencies in the region told me later. </p> <p>To rub salt into the wound, it is a position of international importance that the Saudis could have achieved, had it not torpedoed its joint venture - an Arab news service with the BBC - by taking offence and suspending the satellite network in 1996, after the BBC screened a Panorama programme, Death of a Principle in Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Despite criticism in the west, the channel has much to be proud of - its suspension from Baghdad last week is a further boost to its credibility as an independent operation. </p> <p>I am assured by one of the senior Doha editors that it was the Emir himself who came up with the idea for al-Jazeera and that the channel now has so high a profile that there will never be a reason for him to interfere with the independence of the channel, for his own political reasons. </p> <p>There is talk that al-Jazeera is looking to sell a stake to outsiders. This could only be to demonstrate its independence further, as it isn't a drain on the country's wealth. Although the Emir launched the channel with a budget of $175m and it costs tens of millions to run a year, that figure is put into perspective by the fact that his charitable foundation for education, science and community development has promised an $8bn fund for a new all-digital medical care and research centre in Doha. </p> <p>Qatar, a former British protectorate that once made its fortune from pearls, is an immensely wealthy country with oil and, more significantly, huge gas reserves. </p> <p>Such is the wealth of the country that all 120,000 citizens of the tiny emirate are guaranteed free water, free health care and free private education at home or abroad. This is a country that thinks nothing of reputedly spending \u00a32m of al-Jazeera's budget on flying journalists and opinion-formers from all over the world for its media forum. This is not a country that needs outside investors for a TV news channel.</p>",
  "Tony Blair was waving to the British Olympic team at the opening ceremony in Athens. David Blunkett was bracing himself for a News of the World exclusive about his private life. Meanwhile, the oldest member of the cabinet was pulling an injured kayaker from the rapids near Bala in North Wales. <p>Unlike John Kerry, who once resuscitated a drowning hamster on the shores of a Massachusetts lake, John Prescott was not called upon to perform CPR. But the kayaker - who is thought to have been an East Anglian in his forties - was sufficiently grateful to thank the deputy PM and request a joint photograph.</p> <p>According to the Liverpool Daily Post, the 66-year-old deputy PM was \"revisiting old haunts\" and relatives in North Wales with his wife, Pauline. He saw the kayaker capsize on Friday evening as he was admiring the white-water course at Frongoch.</p> <p>\"While we were standing there this canoe went over and this fella fell out and gashed his forehead,\" Mr Prescott told the paper. \"Blood was coming from his forehead. He's trying to get to the bank and one of the approaching rafts landed on top of him.\"</p> <p>The deputy PM didn't hesitate.</p> <p>\"He got to the quay and one of my special branch guys ran over and grabbed hold of one side. I grabbed hold of the other and we pulled him ashore.</p> <p>\"He was a little bit concussed. I mopped the blood from his face and let him rest for a few minutes and we carried him to the first-aid place and other people took over.\"</p> <p>Undeterred by the experience, the man running the country in Mr Blair's absence put himself at the mercy of the rapids and embarked on a white water-rafting trip. \"I'm going to go back to train in a canoe,\" he told reporters.</p> <p>Water holds no fears for the former National Union of Seamen activist.

  "Children up to the age of five could be kept in prison with their mothers in a controversial scheme being considered by Scotland's only women's jail. <p>At the moment, mothers serving a prison sentence can only keep their children with them until the age of 18 months. But Sue Brookes, governor of Cornton Vale women's prison near Stirling, yesterday revealed that she is keen to extend the age to five in individual cases. </p> <p>Ms Brookes, herself a mother of three, said an open prison offered a fairly natural environment and she did not see the sense of putting children into care. </p> <p>\"I would like the mums to be able to do the same things I can with my children - to play with them and do their homework with them,\" she told the newspaper Scotland on Sunday. </p> <p>If the idea is put into practice, mothers and their children would live in independent living units in the prison grounds. The mother would be free to take her child to nursery but would be bound by prison rules, such as reporting at the gate and being locked in, with her child, at night. </p> <p>After the children turned five they would be passed on to other family members or carers until their mother was freed. </p> <p>\"We are starting to look at the relationship issues that are very likely the reason why [the women] are in here,\" Ms Brookes said. \"There is usually a relationship that has gone badly wrong. We recently managed to get a mum and a two-year-old in the open prison going to a local nursery for the first time. That seems to me to be a good thing.\" </p> <p>Ms Brookes could not be contacted for further comment yesterday, but a spokeswoman for the Scottish Prison Service confirmed that the idea was being considered. Under the Scottish prison system, Ms Brookes can exercise discretion in individual cases. </p> <p>\"When men go to prison they often have a wife or girlfriend outside who can look after the children,\" the SPS spokeswoman said. \"Women tend not to have that kind of support when they go to prison. It does pose a problem.\" </p> <p>The spokeswoman said the scheme, if it did go ahead, would be operated on a case by case basis. The mother would have to satisfy social workers and psychologists that it was in the best interests of her child to stay with her behind bars. </p> <p>Cornton Vale, which hit the headlines in the 1990s (before Ms Brookes' time) after a spate of suicides, currently houses around 340 inmates. There are three children living on the premises at present, two in the main prison and one in one of the independent living units. </p> <p>Ms Brookes has estimated that there could be around 10 children in the jail at any one time if the idea of extending the age is pursued. </p> <p>The proposal has prompted concern, however, from some penal reform campaigners who say prison is no place for a child. </p> <p>Opposition politicians in Scotland are also cautious. Annabel Goldie, justice spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives, said the interests of the child must be paramount. </p> <p>\"Obviously for babies, especially those being breast-fed, being with their mother is very important,\" she said. \"But as children get older and become aware of the circumstances in which they are living, we have to make sure that this is the best option for them.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was amazed to see that Denmark will not permit the addition of nutrients to breakfast cereals (Kellogg's cuts sugar to placate critics, August 13). In Britain, government surveys have repeatedly shown that teenage diets, especially for girls, are alarmingly deficient in calcium and iron. </p> <p>The addition of these minerals to bread and breakfast cereals plays an important part in ensuring our dietary intake is sufficient. Teenagers should be encouraged to eat more of these cereal-based foods, which also provide significant amounts of dietary fibre.<br><strong>Alexander Waugh</strong><br>Director, Grain Information Service </p> <p>The frosty news over Kellogg's reduced sugar initiative ought to provide a timely reminder that industrial sugar is a dangerous commodity that profitably services more than just \"cereal offenders\". In its six centuries of global expansion, there has never been anything \"natural\" about pure sucrose, other than the ironic fact that although there has never been a biological need for the white stuff, it was and is, according to the Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz, \"capitalism's favourite child\". </p> <p>It has become, in its indirect and ubiquitous forms, very much part of the natural architecture of fast foods and processed profits. </p> <p>Wealth, not health, has been the driver throughout its infamous history, but if we could harness the formidable pester power of our kids then Kellogg's might only be the first of many big food giants slain by the financial health warning that industrial sugar is ultimately poison.<br><strong>Ron Noon</strong><br>Liverpool</p>",
  "<p>Another bad night like this and Britain's swimmers will be ready to hit the roof. Except, of course, that there isn't one. The Greeks were not even close to providing a roof to the Olympic aquatic stadium and last night it turned the 100m breaststroke final on which Britain had pinned so many hopes into a failure hard to bear. </p> <p>The searing heat of the morning gave way to a windswept evening, with the water as ripply as an English seaside fun pool. If melanoma doesn't get you in the morning, beware the Athens evening tide. It not only accounted for Darren Mew, strongly fancied as Britain's first medallist, it blew the muscular Texan world record holder Brendan Hansen way off course. </p> <p>Hansen, who swam a world-record 59.30sec in the US trials in Long Beach, California, was almost a second slower last night and conceded gold to Japan's Kosuke Kitajima. Mew trailed in seventh, a place behind his fellow Briton James Gibson. Bronze went to a Frenchman, Hugues Duboscq, who admitted: \"I can't believe my eyes.\" He set his best time this year in Dunkirk - practising in the sea, presumably. </p> <p>The swimming revolution presided over by Bill Sweetenham, so impressive in the build-up to Athens, has had a troubled opening weekend. The judgment on his autocratic rule remains in abeyance. His disciplinarian approach has raised general standards but rewards in Athens are essential if faith is to remain in the Queensland whale, who has recently signed a new four-year contract to take Britain's swimmers to Beijing in 2008. Gold for Melanie Marshall in tomorrow's 200m freestyle final is now desperately needed to bring new impetus. </p> <p>Admittedly, it was a high-calibre 100m breaststroke field. Mew began it ranked second and qualified for the final third fastest but both he and Gibson, bronze medallist in the 2003 world championships, were slow off the blocks and were never in the race. Mew's assertion at Britain's training camp in Paphos that \"in the final, the winner will be the one who handles the pressure the best. I can't wait to get in there and mix it up\" whistled by on the wind. </p> <p>Britain's supposedly battle-hardened team have suffered other striking casualties. Ian Turner, one of the squad's oldest swimmers at 27, had a disastrous time in the 400m individual medley - the event that brought Michael Phelps a world record - recording 10 seconds below his personal best and failing to qualify for the final. Yesterday, Durham's 17-year-old Joanne Jackson finished 21st fastest in the heats of the women's 400m free-style, six seconds adrift of the Olympic qualifying time that had left her ranked seventh in the world. </p> <p>Turner's substandard display was put down by the British camp to a simple attack of nerves, although clues to his uninspired swim might also be gleaned from a pre-Olympic attack on the Sweetenham regime by his sister, Beverley, who argued that Sweetenham \"treads a fine line between guidance and despotism\" and suggested that his authoritarian rule \"risks further infantilising a team who already have a legacy of struggling with individual responsibility\". </p> <p>What is unarguable is that this is an Olympics straight out of a Mediterranean hotel brochure where superficially everything is finished and the atmosphere is relaxed but, whatever you do, don't look out the back. </p> <p>Indeed, British team officials were planning a protest to the International Olympic Committee after Sarah Price gashed her legs minutes before the start of her 100m backstroke semi-final yesterday. Price, sporting cuts on both shins, finished last in her race having jumped on to what she thought was an underwater camera while warming up in the main pool 35 minutes before her race. </p> <p>Not everyone is suffering with the conditions. The South African 4x10m freestyle relay squad of Roland Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend and Ryk Neethling bulldozed to a world record of 3min 13.17sec. The Australians, supreme in Sydney, trailed in seventh. </p> <p>Such was their determination to bring South Africa gold that Neethling and Townsend scratched from the 200m freestyle, which also had heats and semi-finals yesterday, to concentrate on the relay. Schoeman's opening-leg 48.17 equalled the fastest time in the world this year. </p> <p>Inge de Bruijn, the Netherlands' world-record holder for 100m butterfly, was another high-profile casualty last night, though. Her swim of 57.99 was half a second off her heat time and Australia's Petria Thomas took gold. </p> <p>Rebecca Cooke's surprise qualification for the 400m freestyle final in a personal-best time of 4:08.18 augurs well for her stronger suit, the 800m freestyle on Thursday. She could not repeat it last night, losing three seconds and finishing last. Laure Manaudou took France's second gold of the night.</p>"
