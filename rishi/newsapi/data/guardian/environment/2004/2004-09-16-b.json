  "<p>Anglo-Dutch steel producer Corus yesterday reported its first profit since it was formed by the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens almost five years ago. </p> <p>Philippe Varin, the chief executive, acknowledged however that the group still had further improvements to make if it is to match its European rivals. </p> <p>In the first half of the year Corus turned an operating loss of \u00a357m into a profit of \u00a3147m, with the recovery driven by an equal combination of soaring world steel prices and its own internal recovery programme. </p> <p>The news helped the shares climb 2.5p to 52p - despite a private placement of some 100m Corus shares - the equivalent of some 2.25% of the company. </p> <p>Corus said it did not know who had sold the shares or whether they had gone to a single buyer. City sources said, however, they believed the stake had been sold to a number of buyers. </p> <p>Commenting on the first-half performance, Mr Varin said the results showed a substantial improvement and that the group expected margins and operating profits to continue to improve in the second half. </p> <p>But he added: \"We have to keep our feet on the ground, we still have a long way to go. </p> <p>\"We have to lay the foundations for the future growth of the company.\" </p> <p>The group has already been helped by surging global steel demand - led by China and the United States - which has transformed an industry used to growth of 2-3% a year into one that saw demand climb 6% in 2002, 7% last year and an estimated 7-9% this year. </p> <p>Although the surge in demand has sent iron ore and coal pricing spiralling higher, Corus has been able to more than offset the increases through higher steel prices. </p> <p>So far it has pushed up prices by up to 50% this year through a series of increases and is likely to see margins improve even further next year, when it renegotiates contracts covering about 40% of its order book. </p> <p>As well as the improvement in the steel industry's economic fundamentals, Corus is pressing on with its \"restoring success\" programme - which is designed to deliver \u00a3680m of benefits for the group by the end of 2006. </p> <p>As part of the Corus restructuring programme the company is still planning to sell its aluminium business, having overcome opposition from the Dutch trade unions, although it acknowledged yesterday the disposal was unlikely to take place this year. </p> <p>Corus is also negotiating the sale of a controlling stake of its Teesside plant, which produces steel slab, and said yesterday it was in talks with a number of interested parties. </p> <p>They are thought to include the Swiss steel trading group Duferlo and CSN, a Brazilian company, although Corus declined to give details. </p> <p>If a deal does go through, however, Corus is expected to retain a stake of about 25% in order to retain a degree of control over output from the Teesside plant. </p> <p>Yesterday's results were better than the City had been expecting, with analysts looking for earnings from the company - before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - of between \u00a3700m and \u00a3800m for the full year. </p> <p>The steel union, Community, said the results showed the need to expand steel production in the UK, rather than cut it back. </p> <p>\"Should Corus re-evaluate its strategy and take further advantage of the changed market conditions, this really could be a new dawn for the company.\"</p>",
  "<p>Threats by the Democratic US presidential candidate, John Kerry, to pull out of trade agreements if he wins the November election are campaign rhetoric rather than promises, the head of the World Trade Organisation said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has accused George Bush of not defending US economic interests abroad aggressively enough and has said he will review major trade deals that previous administrations signed up to. </p> <p>But Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, in London to launch the WTO's World Trade Report 2005, said trade was a \"non-partisan issue\". </p> <p>\"People have used this sort of rhetoric during campaigns but then, when they govern, they have to observe the rules their country has signed up to.\" </p> <p>The WTO's 147 member countries thrashed out an 11th-hour deal in Geneva in July, which put the \"Doha round\" of world trade talks back on track. Negotiators pledged to work towards a concrete accord by the end of next year. </p> <p>However, the process is currently on hold because of the US election, which could lead to a new American trade representative replacing Robert Zoellick, while Peter Mandelson replaces Pascal Lamy as European trade commissioner in November. </p> <p>Dr Supachai said he would meet Mr Mandelson soon and impress upon him the need to maintain the impetus that led to the July deal. \"I will make clear to him the need for us to build on the July framework. We need to keep that sense of urgency,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Supachai did not want to be tied down to the December 2005 deadline that Mr Lamy and others talked of in July. He said: \"It depends on what we do this year, but the key will be the first half of next year.\" </p> <p>Economists have estimated that a final deal could add more than $500bn (\u00a3277bn) a year to the world economy. However, experts say much work remains to be done if the west is to make good on its promise to reduce its lavish farm subsidies and allow poor countries greater access to its markets. </p> <p>Dr Supachai said the WTO's recent rulings against US subsidies to its cotton farmers and European Union sugar subsidies should have no impact on the progress of the trade talks. </p> <p>The World Trade Report said global trade volumes had expanded 4.5% last year. It predicted stronger growth this year on the back of a recovering world economy. </p> <p>It stressed the importance of \"coherence\" in the economic policies of the countries in the Doha round, so that the benefits of freer trade were not diminished by, for example, poor domestic economic policies or bad infrastructure. </p> <p>\"Governments cannot hope to reap the real benefits of open trade if they fail to secure macroeconomic stability, supportive infrastructure, properly functioning domestic markets and sound institutions,\" said Dr Supachai. </p> <p>The report said the WTO would only seek to free up trade where it was clearly in the interests of all countries concerned: \"Cooperation should not be forced upon governments where there is no perception of a common interest.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Kingfisher retail group - owner of the B&amp;Q home improvement chain and a growing portfolio of international divisions - yesterday swept aside fears that higher interest rates and uncertainty over house prices will retail spending. </p> <p>Gerry Murphy, the chief executive, also explained that B&amp;Q is moving up-market, stocking big-ticket items - including a handmade radiator that will retail at \u00a35,000 - while the company is pursuing expansion with plans for a chain of stores in Russia. </p> <p>Kingfisher operates 579 stores in 10 countries, with more than 40% of sales being generated abroad. </p> <p>Announcing strong sales and better than expected profits, Mr Murphy said August trading had been comparatively good, and there was little to fear from current UK economic conditions. </p> <p>\"Consumption is holding up well. Nothing suggests a tailing off. Unemployment is low, disposable incomes are high on a historic basis and interest rates are low. Generally the environment is benign.\" </p> <p>He said a slowdown in the housing market would not be \"a huge issue\", adding: \"Right now we are not concerned with the housing market.\" </p> <p>Group sales climbed nearly 10% to \u00a34bn and profits in the six months to the end of July were up 18.4% to \u00a3346m - or 20.7% in constant currencies. </p> <p>In Britain, comparative sales at B&amp;Q were ahead 2.5%. The chain's seasonal ranges, which the company conceded were tired, performed poorly, but that dip was offset by strong growth in kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms. </p> <p>Mr Murphy said B&amp;Q was constantly updating and expanding its stores and its \"special order\" catalogues - for gardens, bathrooms, kitchens, air conditioning and so on - had allowed an additional 20,000 lines to be offered. B&amp;Q is determined to attract more high-spending customers and to that end is signing up more kitchen fitters because such buyers expect to have kitchens installed by the retailer. </p> <p>Kingfisher shares are often pushed up by takeover speculation but analysts were impressed with the numbers and the shares rose 9.5p to 299.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Nervous mutterings about the death of the music industry may be premature, but the age of the CD is almost certainly coming to an end. Vinyl, with its tactile glamour, provided its own ritual, from the excitement of placing the needle on the groove to studying the cover artwork in detail. CDs merely perform the function of holding music, and now iPods can do that so much better. The future, if Jean-Michel Jarre is to be believed, lies in a new technology that allows a return to the vinyl experience of pure listening.</p> <p>\"I always dreamed, when I started writing music, to find a way of immersing yourself in it,\" says Jarre, who has just made the world's first record in 5.1, a five-speaker surround-sound system that has so far only been used for movies. Jarre has taken some of his most famous tracks, Equinox and Oxyg\u00e8ne among them, and re-recorded them for Aero, the album that he claims he has been waiting his entire life to make. \"This is not a technological trip but a physical experience, which is what music is. It is sensual, or sexual even, and music has the ability to let you create your own movie. Stereo could never give justice to this experience. Now you can be in the heart of the sound.\"</p> <p>Jarre's Paris pied-\u00e0-terre, in a very smart block under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, seems designed with the sole purpose of providing an environment for this experience. Apart from a bust of Beethoven that was commissioned by Hitler and stolen by the French Resistance en route to Berlin, there are no ornaments in the living room. A row of plastic chairs, surrounded by five speakers, faces a large plasma screen. We take our seats and let Jarre's music assail our senses while the screen holds an image of his girlfriend's eyes, which were filmed in real time as she listened to the album.</p> <p>\"Our senses have changed, even though our emotions have not,\" says Jarre, who looks remarkably young for a man who has been making music since the 1960s; perhaps an electronic image of his deteriorating face is locked deep in some computer vault. \"At the beginning of the 20th century, people were crying in front of silent movies, but if Ridley Scott made a black-and-white silent movie now, he wouldn't find a distributor. So the evolution of our senses is dictated by technology, and during the CD era, we lost our emotional link with music. CDs are not as good as vinyl, and you buy one in the supermarket along with the yoghurt. When I was a kid, an album was something. Finally we can return to the sensual warmth of vinyl with 5.1.\"</p> <p>Jarre insists that the technology is only a means to an end, although the technology meant that everything had to be re-learnt. \"When you make your first album you are a virgin, and you dream, for the rest of your life, of going back to that purity,\" he says. \"With this I was a virgin again because everything was new and nobody had done it before. Soon I'm doing the first concert in 5.1, in Beijing in China, in front of the Forbidden City and near Tiananmen Square. This is an experiment and we do not know how it will work. It is a virgin concert.\"</p> <p>Jarre can trace his musical awakening to seeing a performance of Stravinksy's The Rite of Spring at the Th\u00e9atre de Champs Elys\u00e9es when he was a child. \"This is where Stravinsky created it in 1913, and it was a huge shock. I also saw the last concert by the great Arabic singer Om Khalsoum. She is the goddess, the Maria Callas of the Orient. Then I heard Georgia on My Mind by Ray Charles, and I realised that music can talk to your tummy. I was so impressed by the organic sensuality coming from Ray Charles's music - there was no intellectual process and it was great.\"</p> <p>Another big influence was Pierre Schaffer, the Parisian grandfather of electronic music and the inventor of musique concr\u00e8te . \"He was the first guy to say that music is made not only of notes but also of sounds, so you can record the sound of anything - the rain, footsteps - and turn it into music. Now every band is using musique concr\u00e8te. That is what samples are. Pierre Schaffer, who was my master, began this line of a very influential style.\" Further down this line are Underworld, a key electronic band of the rave era and Jarre's favourite of recent years. \"They should be admired for creating a live experience with electronic music,\" he says. \"Watching people sit behind laptops for two hours is the least sexy experience in the entire world, so I look to opera for inspiration. I use the tools of my generation - lights, electronics - to follow the opera tradition, and Underworld did that too. The musicians are not on show: it is the experience that counts. The performer is only one aspect among other media.\"</p> <p>Jarre, it seems, was a raver before his time, hijacking an unlikely venue, projecting films on the walls and making the light show as important as the music. What he is hoping for now is a shot in the arm from the new technology for a new generation. \"I really love Orbital and the Aphex Twin, and they share the same spirit as me. We will see people like this moving out of the CD era and exploring the possibilities of 5.1. The record industry is not in trouble because people are less interested by music, but because music has been sold as if it were washing-up powder: something functional and disposable. Piracy is not the problem; that is merely a product of the way the industry has gone. We need to move into a new age, in which music can perform the deeper functions that it once did again.\"</p>",

  "As a scion of one of the richest families in America, Laurance Rockefeller owned several homes and estates, many cars including a Bentley, a plane, a 65ft speedboat, and a collection of valuable paintings including works by Gainsborough and Bonnard. Yet in 1976 he wrote an article in Reader's Digest entitled The Case For A Simpler Life. <p>It was one of various paradoxes surrounding Rockefeller, who has died aged 94. He was the fourth of six offspring of John D Rockefeller, whose own father of the same name founded the 19th-century oil monopoly that financed the dynasty. But although his older brother Nelson became a four-term governor of New York and a vice-president under President Gerald Ford, and his younger brother Winthrop was governor of Arkansas, Laurance was never attracted to politics. </p> <p>However, he certainly enjoyed wealth, doubling his own original fortune many times over - but he maintained an enthusiasm not just for financial accumulation, but for new and often risky enterprises. His other great love was nature, and he poured millions into preserving American landmarks, and helped to create a forest of redwoods in California, an unspoiled tract along the Hudson river, a preserve in the Wyoming Grand Teton mountains, and a large national park in the US Virgin Islands. </p> <p>Named after his grandmother Laura, he had an odd childhood, even for such a rich family. His multimillionaire father was frugal and paid the five boys for cleaning shoes and swatting flies, for which they earned 10 cents per 100, and he made them keep accounts. They attended an experimental school based on the idea of learning by doing, and Laurance's interest in travel and exploration was encouraged, stimulating his later passion for the natural environment. </p> <p>Rockefeller entered Princeton University in 1929 and graduated in philosophy, having taken every course in the subject that the college offered. Two years at Harvard law school was enough for Laurance; he quit, deciding law was not for him. He turned to business and when his grandfather died in 1937, he inherited his New York stock exchange seat. </p> <p>But he avoided predictable investments. Both he and his wife (the former Mary French, sister of Nelson's room-mate at Dartmouth college), admired the modernistic furniture of Alvar Aalto, a Finnish architect. Against advice, Rockefeller opened a successful store specialising in Aalto's creations. </p> <p>During the second world war Rockefeller served in the US navy as a procurement officer, but continued to follow new investments. One such venture was to join the first world war flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker and invest in his fledgling Eastern Airlines. Eventually, it became the most profitable airline to emerge in the 1950s, and Rockefeller was the main shareholder. </p> <p>Altogether, he invested in hundreds of new firms including electronics (Intel) and computers (Apple). By 1959, he had invested $8.7m in two dozen companies, which boosted his holdings to more than $28m. In 1969 he established Venrock Associates with members of his family and Rockefeller-backed institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Sloan-Kettering cancer centre. Venrock backed over 220 new ventures, many of them in advanced technology. </p> <p>Rockefeller advised every US president from his appointment by Eisenhower as chairman of the Outdoor Recreation Review commission to study the nation's leisure-time needs. It was President Lyndon Johnson who asked him to intervene in a dispute over a proposed redwood park in northern California, and although Rockefeller compromised by siding with timber interests rather than environmentalists, without his input it is doubtful whether the park, an awesome preservation of the ancient trees, would have been created. </p> <p>He also formed RockResorts in 1956, which built holiday spots in Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands, and Hawaii, which emphasised a closeness to nature. All enabled guests to swim, snorkel, ramble, or watch birds, and in retrospect, they were forerunners of the modern eco-tourist industry. </p> <p>Despite his altruism, Rockefeller continued to make big money. He was 377th in this year's Forbes magazine list of 587 billionaires, with $1.5bn. In 2001, he donated his $30m, 1,106-acre holding in Wyoming to the federal government as part of the surrounding Grand Teton national park. </p> <p>Rockefeller's wife died in 1997 and their four children survive him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Laurance Spelman Rockefeller, financier and philanthropist, born May 26 1910; died July 11 2004</p>",
  "<p>Until recently, satellite navigation systems were the preserve of owners of luxury cars and the odd mini-cab driver. There are signs, however, that global positioning systems (GPS) are going mainstream, with analysts Canalys predicting that sales of units this year could be up to three times the 776,000 devices sold last year. </p> <p>Much of the growth has been fuelled by competitively priced GPS-based systems for PDAs, such as the Navman PiN. However, just as the PDA is being superseded by the smartphone, so GPS manufacturers are jockeying to develop systems compatible with high-end Symbian and Windows Mobile-based phones. </p> <p>So is GPS for cars set to be the next must-have feature for mobiles? </p> <p>Martin Capel-Smith, European marketing manager of Navman - which this week unveiled a trio of standalone GPS devices - says that to work effectively, in-car satellite systems need \"a large colour display, ample memory, a strong integrated GPS receiver, a fast processor and good-quality speakers\". </p> <p>Existing systems, such as the \u00a3200 Tom Tom Mobile and \u00a3200 Route 66, work in a similar way to the ones used on PDAs. They team a phone that displays map software with a matchbox-sized receiver/transmitter that passes data from the satellites to the phone wirelessly via Bluetooth. Users are given directions via a mixture of onscreen 3D maps and voice instructions. The Tom Tom works with the Nokia 6600 and Orange SPV E200 phones: the Route 66 is compatible with most Symbian-based handsets. </p> <p>Both systems deliver reasonably clear maps, easy-to-follow vocal instructions and are quick to offer a re-route should you make a wrong turn. The Route 66 also lets users know via GPRS if there are roadworks and how to avoid them. </p> <p>The trouble with smartphone systems is that screens are too small to deliver a clear picture and - unless they are integrated into a car speaker system - it is hard to hear instruc-tions over the noise of the engine. </p> <p>New developments are just around the corner, however. Phones with hard disks large enough to house maps of continents, and more sophisticated graphics chips, such as the NVIDIA GoForce 3D capable of delivering 3D maps, are being worked on. </p> <p>According to Johan Othelius, Openwave's director of corporate development, the phone's trump card could be the widespread arrival of 3G networks. \"With 3G, users will be able to instantly download a map of an area or their route on to their mobile. The maps will also update in real time to highlight traffic problems.\" </p> <p>UK network 3 already sells phones with integrated AGPS, a version of GPS where the satellite information is enhanced by data from the network. Other networks have been trialling similar devices with Openwave and are working on a range of applications. The day when your phone guides you around town, and takes you to a free parking space, might not be far away. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.navman.co.uk\">www.navman.co.uk</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.66.com\">www.66.com</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.tomtom.com\">www.tomtom.com</a> </p>",
  "The battle for the US presidency enters new territory today with both candidates turning to scientific journals to set out their election promises. <p>In interviews in today's issue of Nature and tomorrow's Science, George Bush and John Kerry outline their positions - from whether the US should build nuclear weapons to global climate change. </p> <p>The arguments are mostly well-established but their engagement with the scientific establishment is revealing. </p> <p>The most divisive issue is stem cell research. Mr Bush froze federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell lines created after 2001 in a move that incensed many biologists who felt such research represented the future. </p> <p>Mr Bush tells Nature he is \"committed to pursuing stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry says he would lift the \"ideologically driven\" limits by over-turning the ban on federal funding of research on new stem cell lines. </p> <p>He is also direct on nuclear weapons: \"I would end the pursuit of a new generation of nuclear weapons.\" </p> <p>In contrast, Mr Bush points to his budget plans for 2005, which contain allowances for an increase in weapons activities. He says: \"The nuclear posture review release by my administration in January 2002 noted that the nation's nuclear infrastructure had atrophied since the end of the cold war and that the evolving security environment requires a flexible and responsive weapons-complex infrastructure.\" </p> <p>He calls climate change \"a serious long-term issue\" and says he wants to sequester carbon and alleviate the rise in greenhouse gas emissions in partnership with other countries. </p> <p>Mr Kerry says: \"I will take the United States back to the international negotiating table while working at home to take concrete steps to reduce pollution, setting concrete limits to halt and reverse growth in global warming pollution and tapping the ingenuity of American industry.\"</p>",
  "<p>No matter how fast your computer, you'll find it grinding to a halt every now and again as you try to do too many demanding things at once. You could add more processors, but that means more heat and more complexity. Processors keep getting faster, but the rest of your hardware isn't keeping up - and there's still a limit to how much they can do. Is this a time when two heads are better than one? </p> <p>Last week's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco saw the chip giant follow in the footsteps of Sun and AMD by announcing a processor road map that includes multiple-core technologies. Multi-core chips are an approach that means much more bang for your IT buck, but it's also one that needs new hardware, new operating systems and - in some cases - new application software before you will see real benefits. It will also need a new approach to software licensing from the IT industry. </p> <p>Multiple-core chips are just what you would expect: several processor cores on a single die. It's an approach that chip designers find attractive, because it means they can improve performance by adding extra cores, rather than by developing chips that operate at ever higher clock frequencies. It's also an approach that gets around one of the biggest bottlenecks in system design: memory speed. There's little point in ramping up processor speed if memory chips can't receive or deliver data quickly enough to keep up. </p> <p>At IDF, Intel demonstrated systems running with a sample version of its Montecito chip. A next-generation Itanium, this is a dual-core system with each chip handling four separate threads. Getting Montecito into production will be a massive undertaking, with each chip containing more than 1.7bn transistors. However, Intel is promising significant performance gains, especially for scientific computing. </p> <p>High performance systems such as Nasa's Project Columbia supercomputer should see the greatest benefit from Montecito, and this may be where Itanium will finally find its niche. Columbia is a Linux system based around SGI's Altix platform, and uses more than 3,000 Itanium 2 processors, with a total of more than 10,000 planned. It is used to handle complex simulations such as predicting the weather. Switching Columbia from Itanium 2 to Montecito will add significant amounts of computing power - even pre-production chips give a 1.5x to 2x performance boost. A multi-core Columbia could help Nasa keep ahead of Caribbean hurricanes at the same time as putting the Shuttle into space and getting man back on the moon. </p> <p>So what about multi-core for the rest of us? Pentium 4 and Xeon chips will go the same way, as will Intel's low power ARM-based XScale processors, used in PDAs and smartphones. Intel is planning to ship its first dual-core chips for desktops and servers in 2005, and predicts that by 2006 more than 40% of new desktop PCs, more than 85% of new servers, and more than 70% of mobile systems will use dual- and multi-core chips. Meanwhile, AMD is promising dual-core Opteron processors for the middle of next year, with desktop chips coming in the second half. </p> <p>Even if the real world doesn't match the PowerPoint slides, we are going to see a big change in the technologies that power the computers around us over the next two years. </p> <p>You will be able to run all your programs faster. Alternatively, you could use a dual-core PC to virtually separate work and play, and even trap viruses and malware before they damage your data. Don't worry about processor-intensive 3D user interfaces in future versions of Windows: you could devote a whole core to running them if necessary. </p> <p>Then there's the environment to think about. Dual-core processors can run cooler than a ramped-up single-core system, and will also keep power requirements down. </p> <p>Technologies that Intel developed for the mobile Centrino chips manage each core, and allow lower power use by turning cores on and off as needed. If your PC isn't busy, you could find it's only using one core, or that both cores in a dual-core chip are operating at different clock speeds and voltages. With laptop-style power management, a dual- core system should therefore be more economical to run than today's desktop computers. </p> <p>Apple and AMD have touted the idea of the \"megahertz myth\", pointing out (correctly) that processor performance is more than just clock speed. Dual-core is another way of delivering more power for the same number of clock cycles, and Intel has now converted to this way of thinking. It is talking about \"pervasive parallelism\" as a key to the next wave of IT spending - and the next generation of the web. </p> <p>The first production Intel dual-core processors for general purpose use are unlikely to support the hyper-threading found in Pentium 4 and Xeon today, which, to an extent, already enables one processor to work as though it were two. There's no technological reason why Intel's multi-core chips shouldn't also support hyper-threading, and it is part of the Montecito design. However, there may be licensing issues with operating systems. Even a Windows XP Professional Edition license only supports two processors, and Windows sees each thread in a hyper-threaded system as a separate processor. </p> <p>Intel says it is talking to software vendors but the early days of multi-core licensing are likely to be a minefield for the end user - especially if your new four-way, four-core server suddenly turns into a 16-CPU system when it comes to licensing your enterprise software. It could quadruple software costs overnight. </p> <p>Operating systems will need to be modified to handle the new chips with their expanded instruction sets, and developers will need to learn how to take advantage of the new features. While most applications will work out of the box, the enhanced languages needed to take advantage of parallelism are still on the drawing board. Microsoft's Cambridge Research Lab has released an experimental language, Comega, which makes handling the many possible processing threads in a complex multi-core system easy to understand. </p> <p>Intel is developing a hardware-based virtual machine monitor to help tools such as VMware and Virtual PC take advantage of hardware, rather than patching operating systems. Other Intel technologies planned for multi-core chips are intended to make processors work well with secure code, and to help management tools control desktop PCs and servers - even if they've had a catastrophic hardware failure. But you may need to wait for the next version of Windows, Longhorn, to get the most out of next-generation processors. </p> <p>The arrival of PC dual-core processors will mean a new generation of more powerful, cooler and more economical PCs.

  "<p>Richard North, chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group, has been ousted from his post after a boardroom coup by non-executive directors. </p> <p>The move comes two years after he fought off a hostile bid for the business's then parent group, Six Continents. </p> <p>His departure comes as the hotel group is selling more than \u00a32.2bn of assets and returning \u00a31bn to shareholders. </p> <p>That marks the completion of a list of long-standing demands from disaffected shareholders, furious at acquisitions pursued by the Six Continents conglomerate while Mr North was its finance director. </p> <p>In January 2002 a leaked letter from fund management group Hermes described the group's strategy as \"value destroying\" and many shareholders targeted chairman Sir Ian Prosser and Mr North for blame. </p> <p>Despite plans to break up Six Continents, formerly known as Bass, relations with shareholders continued to decline and within months corporate raider Hugh Osmond launched a \u00a35.6m hostile bid. </p> <p>The offer was rejected, but not before Mr Osmond accused Six Continents' management of destroying almost \u00a36bn in value over 10 years and described Mr North as \"a muppet\". </p> <p>Investors eventually backed Six Continents' break-up proposals, which has seen the group split into pub operator Mitchells &amp; Butler and Inter Continental, run by Mr North. In May shareholders again raised questions about Mr North's pledges on asset sales. He was forced to admit he had been \"a little too delphic\". </p> <p>InterContinental also plans to spin off the Britvic soft drinks business, in which it holds a 47% share - possibly through a float next year. </p> <p>Yesterday former Safeway chairman David Webster, who took over from Sir Ian at the start of the year, made clear that he and his fellow part-time directors had ousted Mr North. </p> <p>\"Richard had the right qualities for us over the last two years when financial skills were important,\" said Mr Webster, who will run the business until a new chief executive is found. </p> <p>\"Now we need someone with skills focused on our global brand.\" </p> <p>Yesterday shares in InterContinental closed the session 14.5p higher at 636p. </p> <p>Mr North, who spent 23 years as an accountant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said in a statement: \"I would love to continue to manage InterContinental ... but I recognise that someone else whose business background has been developing and managing brands may be better placed to ensure the company creates maximum value for shareholders.\" </p> <p>Mr North will step down at the end of the month and be entitled to a payoff under the terms of the 12-month notice period in his contract. </p> <p>Last year he received a basic salary of \u00a3429,000.</p>",
  "<p><strong>imagine.art.after</strong> is an exhibition about the proximity of art and life against the backdrop of contemporary world politics. All participating artists are from one of 35 countries whose people, according to the Home Office, make the most applications for asylum in the UK. The exhibition will take part in two stages during 2005.</p> <p>The first stage of imagine.art.after will be hosted by Guardian Unlimited and will aim to serve as a platform for a dialogue between artists who are geographically separated but culturally related. Artists who are refugees based in London will be coupled with an artist from their country of origin and communicate with them. The artists who stayed and the artists who left will engage in a process of creating cross-narratives about situations in their individual areas of work and life. These may evolve along subtle lines of culture and history, place and displacement, survival and self-preservation. Using images, video and text, the art couples will embark on a journey to produce work, exchange views and engage in a dialogue with the exhibition's team, with journalists and Guardian Unlimited readers.</p> <p>The second part of imagine.art.after will be an exhibition staged at the extraordinary gothic environment of the Union Chapel, North London, where a selection of work created online will take an actual form, as devised and agreed by the artists.</p> <p>The imagine.art.after exhibition team is comprised of curator Breda Beban, artist/independent curator; producer Julia Farrington, Union Chapel Projects; and researcher Margareta Kern, artist.</p> <p>On completion of the selection process for participating artists, the imagine.art.after exhibition team will promote and facilitate an online dialogue between all artists on equal footing. Hardware and training will be provided as necessary.</p> <p><strong>Selection criteria for artists:</strong></p> <p>If you are an artist and/or film-maker interested in taking part in imagine.art.after and meet all of the following criteria we would like to hear from you:</p> <p>If either:</p> <p>1) You are based in London and have gained or are seeking refugee status in the UK and you originally come from one of the following countries:</p> <p>Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Burundi, China, Colombia, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Iran , Iraq, Jamaica, Liberia, Moldova, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan , Turkey, Uganda, Vietnam, Zimbabwe</p> <p>Or:</p> <p>2) You are an artist and / or film-maker resident, national, and currently living in one of the countries listed above.</p> <p>And:</p> <p>3) You are an artist and/or film-maker with a track record of showing work in this or any other country.</p> <p>4) You are willing to share your area of work and life with the exhibition's team, the journalists and Guardian Unlimited readers.</p> <p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p> <p>Your application must include:</p> <p>- a CV (curriculum vitae, clearly stating country of origin)</p> <p>- six to 10 images of your work in any format (eg. slides, photographs, prints) and/or up to three examples of your time-based work on CD or VHS.

  "Simply by having a column in a national newspaper, I am seen as a spokesman for the disabled. As someone who was injured relatively recently, this disturbs me. It is only four and a half years since I broke my neck and became paralysed from the shoulders down. <p>I have been at home for a little over three years and only really feel that I have been settled for the past year or so - that is, settled enough to engage actively with the outside world. In the realm of spinal injuries alone, it would be presumptuous of me to set myself up as a spokesman. There are people who have been injured for decades and there is the Spinal Injuries Association to represent all of us. </p> <p>I have even offended some people by using the word \"disabled\" in this context. Long before being injured I was very well aware of the debate raging around the word by activists campaigning on behalf of people with \"impairments\", who believe the word \"disabled\" should be reserved for what society imposes on us. For them it is the attitudes of people, the unwillingness of society to adapt the environment - so that everybody can get access to buildings and facilities, and move freely along streets and pavements - which disables, not the various conditions themselves. </p> <p>I am sympathetic to this position. In an earlier column I described, light-heartedly, the shenanigans required to get into my local art gallery in Sheffield. More recently I went to Wyndham's Theatre in the West End to see Michael Frayn's Democracy. There, disabled access meant three blokes trundling me down eight steps through a side entrance to the stalls. They assured me, and I believed them implicitly, that in the event of fire my well-being would be their first thought and they would be prepared to sacrifice themselves to save me. </p> <p>Fortunately, there was no fire so their dedication was not put to the test and at the end of the performance they dragged me back up the steps at some peril to their backs. </p> <p>Reaching the car, we found the City of Westminster demonstrating its meanspiritedness towards Blue Badge holders, who can park freely almost anywhere in the country but not in precious Westminster. I duly paid my \u00a350 parking fine. </p> <p>I still find the word \"disabled\" hard to avoid - and I dislike the words I can use being dictated to me. I feel disabled, and every day I am conscious of what I have lost. The word is sufficiently elastic to cover both meanings. However, I don't condemn those who disagree and who are fighting for rights that cannot be sneered away, as \"politically correct\" (an infinitely more unpleasant, tendentious phrase). </p> <p>People with long-term injuries or people born disabled have a very different experience from mine. I have been severely told off for using the phrase \"wheelchair bound\" in conversation with a friend who has a disabled daughter. Having been disabled all her life she is liberated by her wheelchair and feels perfectly OK the way she is, even resenting the implication that to be fully ambulant is superior or more \"natural\". I, too, would be lost without my wheelchair but I still feel more inhibited than liberated. </p> <p>It may be that there are as many attitudes to disablement as there are disabled or able-bodied people (another problematic phrase). Would that be surprising? I don't want to trivialise the argument but it is not unlike that about baldness. I have been pretty well bald since my mid-20s and, though I admit to a sneaking desire to have a full shock of hair, have never had the slightest inclination to sport a comb-over or don a wig. </p> <p>I read recently that they were close to hunting down the gene for baldness, opening up the possibility of all baldies being transformed to the hirsute beings of our imaginings. The thought would horrify my children, who were appalled when I shaved off my beard and equally appalled when I proposed growing it again several years later. </p> <p>The situation has now become even more complicated. I am excited by the thought of stem-cell and other therapies becoming available for spinal injury in the near future, even though I may be a bit old to benefit from them. For people reconciled to their condition so that it feels completely normal, the prospect of even a partial \"cure\" sows confusion alongside hope. What now of their identity? Uncertainty is so much more difficult to live with.</p> <p><a href=\"edguiton@yahoo.com\">edguiton@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Nottingham lecturers today won the support of the Trades Union Congress to push ahead with a campaign to ask other academics around the world to boycott their university over a row about performance related pay.</p> <p>Nottingham Association of University Teachers are in a stand-off with their university over the proposed new contracts which they say would mean that they would only get a pay rise if they achieved an \"excellent\" rating in a performance related pay scheme and that some non-academic staff would be denied a pension in future. </p> <p>The AUT say they will call off the boycott if the university re-enters talks. The university says it won't talk until they have called off the boycott. </p> <p>In a debate which led to moves to condemn performance-related pay at the TUC conference in Brighton today, Nigel Gates an national executive member of the AUT presented the Nottingham case as the \"worst case scenario\" for performance related pay. </p> <p>\"Nottingham University is leading the PRP assault in higher education,\" he said to applause. \"There is no place for PRP in the public sector.\"</p> <p>In a counter-move, the university today took out adds in a national newspaper to set out their side of the story. Philip Dalling, head of public relations at the university, said it was necessary to pay for the advert to make a public declaration in the face of a global boycott. </p> <p>He went on: \"What we're saying is that we can't quite understand the problem with performance related pay because there already is a system of performance related pay. PRP exists already in the academic pay and reward system. This is a more fair and transparent system which is largely driven by the fact that a majority of people don't believe that the current system is fair.\" </p> <p>He admitted that they were worried about the impact of a boycott: \"We're concerned that they should be doing this and obviously we find it very regrettable and would very much like to be talking to the AUT about this,\" but added: \"If they say they'll call off the greylisting then we're very happy to talk with them.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Whitehead, head of public affairs at AUT, said that they had already received messages of support from around the world for the boycott. He said of the dispute: \"It's the worst form of university management we've come across in years. They are refusing to negotiate and they are adopting a very hard headed approach to the whole problem over pay... This is a breakdown in relations.\"</p> <p>Some students at London Metropolitan University still haven't received their proper exam marks after external moderators refused to mark them when similar moves were taken over a dispute there earlier this summer.</p>",
  "<p>Pressure on French advertising group Havas mounted today as it emerged that corporate raider and dissident shareholder Vincent Bollore has asked for seats on the company's board.</p> <p>The revelation follows Mr Bollore's decision to raise his stake in Havas to 10.4%, which added to speculation that the world's sixth biggest advertising group could soon be sold after it lost out in the bidding for Grey Global.</p> <p>\"We are looking at this. We are reflecting about putting representatives on the board,\" the Havas chairman and chief executive, Alain de Pouzilhac, told a news conference reported by Reuters today.</p> <p>\"It seems legitimate to me that this shareholder is asking to be represented. I've talked to him several times. Vincent Bollore told me he'd like to be on the Havas board,\" he said.</p> <p>He described Mr Bollore - who opposed the Havas board's decision to bid for Grey - as an \"anchor point\" and welcomed his involvement in the company.</p> <p>\"Bollore represents a wonderful opportunity for us because he is an anchor point. It's very good news for the group, and I take it as such.\"</p> <p>Havas failed in its quest for Grey earlier this week when the American group was sold to Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP.</p> <p>After winning the Grey auction, Sir Martin warned Havas it could get left behind as a middle-ranking company as the industry becomes more consolidated, with a four-strong elite of WPP, Omnicom, Interpublic and Publicis now established.</p> <p>He even refused to rule out bidding for the company, though conceded it was \"probably wrong for us to focus on Havas\".</p> <p>When Mr Pouzilhac was asked today whether Havas was now a target, he said the group was under no greater threat than it had been before its offer for Grey failed.</p> <p>He said the company, which is home to the Euro RSCG network, had the resources to develop on its own.</p> <p>\"We have the talents and fundamentals that permit Havas to continue its development alone,\" he said.</p> <p>The group said today it had improved profits in the first half of the year after a restructuring process and announced plans for a rights issue to raise funds.</p> <p>Havas' net profit in the first half off 2004 was \u00a39.5m, compared with a net loss of \u00a339m a year earlier, when the company was hit by writedowns.

  "<p>Reviewing Steve Bell's Apes of Wrath is a tough task. The difficulty? How not to sound too sycophantic, for the Guardian cartoonist has produced another masterpiece.</p> <p>Sharp, funny and a pleasure to hold, it tells the \"shocking story of the war on terror in glorious colour\". The ape in question is of course US President George Bush, whom Bell has immortalised for thousands as a slack-jawed, arm-swinging chimpanzee.</p> <p>Fans of Bell's work will recognise his cast of characters: a poodle Tony Blair, with a union jack stuck up his anus; a baby William Hague, confined to an electric pushchair; and bomber Clare Short, her face the nose of a B52.</p> <p>But it is President Bush with whom he has the most fun: twisting his features in wilder and wilder flights of fancy without once losing the essence of the man, frequently depicting his chimp-pout as the barrel of a gun. </p> <p>The words - it is supposedly narrated by the president himself - are also a pleasure. The glossary at the back is a particular joy. Those familiar with Bell's cartoon strip, If, will recognise the phrases but won't be able to suppress a snort of laughter.</p> <p>Airbs are apparently folks who are mainly moozlums, Hungrovia is somewhere in eastern Yurp, while xylophone seekers are what keeps Primester Tony Blair awake at night.</p> <p>Apes of Wrath is not, however, just a collection of fun cartoons and good Bush gags. It is also a cry of fury against the Bush presidency, and what Bell names the Blair sycophancy. </p> <p>If Art Spiegelman's graphic book, In the Shadow of No Towers, was drawn more in sorrow than anger, Bell has taken the opposite approach. Even opponents of the president will find themselves wincing at the treatment he metes out.</p> <p>With Bell's increasing popularity in America, largely spread through the international success of Guardian Unlimited, it is amazing that he has not yet become a global brand; a sort of counter-culture Walt Disney if you will.</p> <p>Like the creator of Mickey Mouse, he has a series of instantly recognisable characters; many of them anthropomorphised like the cast of many a Disney film.</p> <p>If the world will queue up in multiplexes for Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and the anti-McDonalds Super-Size-Me, surely it would pay to see If, the Movie. Apes of Wrath will do admirably until that hits the screens.</p>",
  "The government's architecture watchdog is to face a new inquiry prompted by concerns over potential conflicts of interests in the way it reviews major building projects. <p>The select committee of Office of the Deputy Prime Minister today announced it will review the role and effectiveness of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe).</p> <p>The committee's chairman, Andrew Bennett, said he was concerned that Cabe's influential assessments of new building projects were informed more by friendships and business connections than by objective standards.</p> <p>The announcement of the MPs' investigation comes after a tough few months for Cabe. In April its founding chief executive, Jon Rouse, left for the Housing Corporation. In June Cabe's chairman, Sir Stuart Lipton, a prominent developer, was forced to stand down after a government audit concluded that the agency was too close to developers.</p> <p>Cabe has a remit to review all new major building proposals. The verdicts of its design review panel carry considerable weight with local planning authorities. </p> <p>Cabe insists that it has a rigorous system for avoiding conflicts of interests in the way schemes are assessed by its architect-dominated panel.</p> <p>But Mr Bennett is concerned that the \"cliquey\" design world means that there is not enough separation between panel members and the developers putting forward schemes.</p> <p>He said: \"It looks cliquey. It is not a very big world, and a lot are involved in doing each other's washing - they may not be working on the scheme being reviewed but they may be working for the developer somewhere else. In a lot of cases their expertise seems to be based on friendship patterns rather than any objective standards.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There should be an absolute separation between people making decisions about development and people with any financial interest in it.</p> <p>His comments come after Cabe recommended that the Regent Palace hotel should be demolished to make way for a new building designed by a member of its design review panel. </p> <p>Although the scheme's architect, Graham Morrison, took no part in the discussions, Mr Bennett thinks Cabe could go further in guarding against conflicts. </p> <p>He is also concerned that Cabe's assessments have more influence on the planning process than is warranted. </p> <p>He said: \"Cabe are considered to be more expert than there is any evidence for. It is subverting the planning process.\"</p> <p>The MPs will look at the criteria used by Cabe in assessing schemes, the consistency of its judgment, and it the choice of schemes reviewed. It will also look at the future of the organisation and its relationships with other agencies.</p> <p>A spokesman for Cabe said: \"Cabe will be offering the committee its fullest cooperation. We see this as an opportunity to clarify and to champion what Cabe does, and look forward to providing written as well as oral evidence of our activities and impact in due course.\"</p>",

  "<p>The banks of the river Tyne are not often associated with ideas of hi-tech innovation. It's a surprise, then, to discover that more new technology companies are being created in the north-east than anywhere else outside London right now. </p> <p>Just take a walk around the streets of South Shields, Gateshead or Wallsend and you won't be far from some shiny new IT company. The once-notorious Pink Lane - Newcastle's former red light district - is currently home to a suite of software developers, while the old casino now plays host to Mere Mortals, a chart-topping game development firm. </p> <p>And it's not just Newcastle where the chips are up. Any tour around the region's hi-tech hotspots should include Sunderland, Middlesbrough and the digital delights of downtown Darlington. Away from the cities, even small Northumbrian towns are proving capable of growing innovative IT companies. Venture to windy Rothbury and you will find a company pioneering technology that simulates touch, while down the coast, the sleepy former coal port of Amble supports one of the UK's leading companies in the emerging field of locative media. </p> <p>In total, the north-east is home to 550 digital companies, employing 42,739 people and generating millions of pounds for the region's economy. According to estimates by the regional development agency, digital industries are now the north-east's third largest employer after tourism and food and drink. </p> <p>The transformation of the quayside in Gateshead and the area's cultural renaissance has made the city renowned as a model of regeneration - but its economic revival is less well known. This is partly because old problems persist - more than 400 workers were laid off at a nearby oil platform company last month - with large parts of Newcastle and Sunderland remaining devoid of much industry of any sort. </p> <p>But the latest data on regional output looks promising. In 2002, the north-east enjoyed the highest growth in gross value per capita in the UK - the region's biggest increase for more than a decade. This was thanks in no small part to the gang of games companies, software developers and dotcom survivors that make up the region's emerging digital cluster. </p> <p>According to a survey by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (Gem), Newcastle is at the centre of the fastest growing IT sector outside London. In 2002, one in five of all new technology start-ups were in the north-east. That figure fell back a little last year, but more recent data from Trends Research indicate the number of people employed in games development, for example, has risen almost threefold from 60 in 2001 to 170 today. Multimedia and animation firms have also seen significant growth, while the number of those employed in internet services has grown by as much as 80%. </p> <p>Still, recent history teaches us that digital industries can be as fickle as the board of Newcastle United. It is one thing to create a climate where software companies can take advantage of artificial economic conditions such as cheap rent or EU-funded broadband, but it is another to sustain success over the longer term. After all, the region has been here before: in the late 90s, big companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Atari all invested in companies based in the north-east - only to watch them crash when the internet bubble burst. </p> <p>But this time it could be different. In January, an innovative project hoping to create more sustainable growth in the IT sector was launched in Newcastle. Modelled on the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany - the lab that invented the MP3 - Codeworks is a 10-year, \u00a320m regional development project with the ambition to become self-funding within five years. </p> <p>Codeworks organises networking events, helps raise venture capital and establishes research programmes. There is nothing new there - the Scots have had similar agencies at work for more than a decade - but what makes Codeworks different is its attitude towards intellectual property. If any company spins out from the research it commissions, Codeworks retains the intellectual property and grants licences to its partners \"to exploit much how they wish\". And any profit made from these ventures will eventually return to the region. </p> <p>\"We are like a private investment company,\" explains Herbert Kim, Codeworks's high-flying chief executive, a history graduate of Princeton University who attained his MBA at Wharton School in the US. \"Except our goals are not primarily financial.\" </p> <p>He says that Codeworks' objectives are straightforward: attract more IT companies and more jobs to the region. \"But they have to be higher value,\" he insists. \"It is no good just attracting low-value jobs in call centres. They will move away.\" </p> <p>What Kim wants is to see more companies such as Sage, the accountancy software company that looms over the north-east's IT industry just as Sir Norman Foster's new Sage music centre imposes itself on the Gateshead quayside. </p> <p>Established in Newcastle 21 years ago, Sage has become the UK's most valuable software company and the only one to be listed on the FTSE 100. Cornering the market in accounting and business management software for small and medium-sized companies, it now has 3.6 million customers worldwide and - not surprisingly - Microsoft is in hot pursuit. </p> <p>Last month, the company launched Version 11 of its successful Line 50 accounting software. According to Adrian Grade, managing director of Sage's small business division, the order book is already full and annual leave practically postponed until the autumn. Sage has survived both the north-east's long economic slumber and the dotcom bust. </p> <p>One company that hopes to emulate Sage's success is Trackaphone, based 30 miles north of Newcastle in Amble. It employs just six people, but hopes to have another 50 within three years. Trackaphone operates in the emerging field of locative media, tracking the location of Sim cards for a range of corporate clients by accessing the GPS (Global Positioning System) feeds supplied by mobile operators. The company went live last October and has since won orders from 250 companies to track more than 3,000 phones. </p> <p>\"People are always surprised that we are based in Amble,\" says Phil Derry, the company's chairman. \"But I keep telling them we don't have to live in Basingstoke to have a knowledge-based business.\" </p> <p>Business is good, he says, recruitment is no problem and rent is cheap. \"The one disadvantage is the telecoms connection. What we get in Amble is almost twice as much as it would have cost us in Newcastle.\" </p> <p>But Derry's dream of cheaper connectivity could soon be reality as the north-east moves toward the kind of broadband connectivity rates usually associated with South Korea. BT recently announced that every local telephone exchange in the region will be fitted with broadband by February. These exchanges, moreover, will be furnished with \"future proof\" fibre-optic cables capable of harnessing the swifter broadband speeds now coming online. Nowhere else in the UK will have anything like it for at least another six months. </p> <p>If there is anything restraining the digital cluster it is the attitude of high finance. A complaint heard time and again is that the region suffers from a lack of investment. There are just two venture capital companies in the region and neither specialises in IT. </p> <p>Codeworks is attempting to change that, and it has already helped 15 companies in their applications for early stage finance and helped secure \u00a3300,000 of funding for five companies, including those who had struggled to get the attention of London-based venture capitalists. </p> <p>Despite five universities in the north-east - two of which are considered world class - the region has consistently failed to retain its brightest graduates. But that might change. Already, a tide of Geordies is returning north, often to take advantage of lower house prices. </p> <p>Paul Campbell left Newcastle to go to Oxford University. He worked as a BBC reporter for seven years before establishing an independent production company in London. The Amazing Group made commercials, corporate films and eventually multimedia for big clients such as Channel 4 and Tyne Tees, but a combination of getting \"fed up\" with London and a desire for a more regular income than TV production led him back to his native city. </p> <p>\"I really like the idea that you can serve the global market without having to be based in Carnaby Street,\" he says. \"Our office in Grey Street is 24 times cheaper than our London office and it's the same size.\" The Amazing offices are housed in an elegant neo-classical building in what is regarded as the finest street in the north-east. </p> <p>There are less mercenary advantages, too, he says. \"There is a sense that comes from historic deprivation that you have to help each other - because nobody else will. And that, I think, is translating into a much more positive, collaborative attitude to the region as a whole.\" </p> <p>But Codeworks will need much more than camaraderie and appetite to sustain the recent growth. \"It's not technical staff we need,\" says Steve Caughey of Arjuna, a leading web services developer taking on the best in Silicon Valley, \"it is access to people with expertise in sales, marketing, business and venture capital\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\">online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>An unexpected bounce in retail sales in August today fuelled expectations of another rise in interest rates before the end of the year.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales rose 0.6% last month versus expectations of a 0.3% fall, bringing the year-on-year rate up to 6.5%.</p> <p>Today's figures came as a surprise to the City following recent indications of a slowing down of the economy, particularly in house prices. The apparent cooling off of the property market and in consumer spending had led analysts to pare back their interest rate forecasts. Most analysts think that interest rates, currently at 4.75%, are close to their peak. But the latest retail sales figures may lead to some reassessment.</p> <p>\"The fundamentals remain the key and on that basis conditions for the consumer remain positive. Employment is at a record high, real earnings growth is stronger than last year and interest rates are just 4.75%. </p> <p>\"A material consumer slowdown will require higher interest rates. We still expect a November rate move, with more to come thereafter,\" said John Butler of HSBC, a longtime sceptic of the notion that the consumer is losing wind.</p> <p>The rebound in August sales was led by sharp rises for clothing and footwear and department stores. Textile, clothing and footwear sales jumped 3.7 % on the month, their biggest increase in more in than a year. </p> <p>The ONS data contrasted sharply with survey evidence suggesting that exceptionally wet weather in August had kept consumers away from shops, particularly clothing stores. </p> <p>B&amp;Q, the DIY chain owned by Kingfisher, said earlier that high growth in kitchens, bathrooms and electricals offset weakness in more seasonal ranges such as garden furniture and exterior decoration. </p> <p>\"The relatively strong rebound in retail sales volumes in August, after July's drop, indicates that recent reports of the death of the consumer may be premature and reinforces our belief that the Bank of England will still raise interest rates by 25 basis points in November,\" said Howard Archer, an economist with the consultancy Global Insight. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless, August's rebound was probably influenced by significant discounting, highlighting the fact that shoppers are very price-conscious.</p> <p>Taken over a three-month basis, however, retail sales in the three months to August grew at its slowest pace since the three months to September last year. For the three months to August, sales were 1.4% higher than in the previous quarter. That followed growth of 1.8% in the three months to July and 1.9% in the three months to June.</p>",
  "<p>Very unlikely. Weather systems in the Atlantic follow a 20-year cycle of severe storms and relative calm. We just happen to be nearly 10 years into the upswing of this cycle. </p> <p>Meteorologists use several factors to calculate how many storms are likely to turn up in the Atlantic. \"We find that hurricane activity is strongly linked to sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and low-level trade winds in the Atlantic and the Caribbean,\" says Andrew Lea, of the seasonal weather forecast group at University College London. \"The sea surface temperatures [this year] have been considerably above average, as have the trade winds.\" </p> <p>The US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted that in 2004, there would be a 45% probability of an above average hurricane season. There was also a 45% probability of a near normal season, with only a 10% chance of a below average one. </p> <p>In NOAA's definitions, \"normal\" for the Atlantic season is 9.6 tropical storms, 5.6 of which become hurricanes and 1.9 major hurricanes. Its forecast for this year's season is 12 to 15 tropical storms, with six to eight becoming hurricanes and two to four of these becoming major hurricanes. </p> <p>Since the start of the new cycle in 1995, there have been, on average, 13.7 tropical storms, 7.7 hurricanes and 3.6 major hurricanes every year. So far this year, we are only halfway through the hurricane season, so can expect even more storms. \"Mostly the peak of the activity's in September,\" says Lea. </p> <p>Don't expect things to be much better next year. Thanks to the 20-year cycle, there will be another decade of relatively severe storms before the Atlantic weather cycle starts going the other way. This cycle also explains why the idea that global warming is powering the Atlantic storms of recent years is likely to be unfounded. </p> <p>\"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has expressed concern that the increasing number of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would result in increased tropical sea surface temperatures,\" says Dominic Woollatt, of the Met Office. \"That would lead to an increase in the mean and maximum intensity of a tropical cyclone. But it's very hard to say whether sea surface temperature change is caused by climate change or whether it would have changed like that anyway.\" </p> <p>Lea dismisses the idea that global warming is behind the weather. \"We have found that there is no correlation at all with the tropical cyclone activity and the current global warming,\" he says. \"We looked at tropical cyclone activity over the northern hemisphere and we had a look at the trends in that over the last 50-100 years ... if anything, there was even a slight downward trend.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>SIG</strong>, Britain's leading distributor of insulation products, may not be the most exciting company on the stock market but its shareholders are not complaining. </p> <p>Its share price has more than doubled in the past 18 months as the group has found itself one of the main beneficiaries of new legislation on thermal and sound emissions. It was on the move again yesterday, closing 7.5p stronger at a record 452.75p after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and set a 510p target price. </p> <p>City professionals reckon that was not the only factor driving the shares higher, though. They believe Saint-Gobain, Europe's leading building materials group, is running the slide rule over the company. </p> <p>Despite its recent strong run many analysts, including Mark Hake at Merrill Lynch, reckon SIG is still cheap, given the regulatory environment in Europe. </p> <p>Indeed, its shares at present are at a discount to its peers in the construction and building materials sector. </p> <p>On top of that, traders note that Saint-Gobain returned to the acquisition trail early this year with the purchase of Dahl International, Scandinavia's biggest plumbing product distributor. </p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares surrendered early gains to close little changed. Having raced to 4,575 points - its highest level since April 28 - the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> index fell back to finish a mere 2.8 points higher at 4,548.4 as Wall Street opened lower after a profits warning from Coca-Cola and the Nasdaq came under pressure from Goldman Sachs downgrading its rating on the computer software and hardware sectors. </p> <p><strong>Abbey National</strong>, down 37.5p at 572.5p, was the biggest blue-chip faller after <strong>HBOS</strong>, up 23.5p at 738p, announced it would not be making an offer for the former building society. </p> <p>It was closely followed by <strong>Scottish &amp; Newcastle</strong>, 14.25p lighter at 384p, and <strong>Diageo</strong>, 20p lower at 687.5p, as both traded ex-dividend - or without entitlement to their latest dividend payment. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index shed 1.2 points to 6,250.2, and the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index was off just 1.3 points at 2,562.7. In the bond market, gilts closed lower. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed around 100.65, yielding 4.917%. </p> <p><strong>Cadbury Schweppes</strong> was one of the day's main talking points. Its shares fell 9p to 441p, unsettled by the Coke profit alert. Cadbury is competitor to Coke through its Dr Pepper and 7-Up brands. The Coke warning also upset can maker <strong>Rexam</strong>, 2p weaker at 416.5p. </p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> advanced 16p to \u00a313.98 after the top-rated mining team at blue-chip broker Cazenove upgraded the shares. \"We feel Rio Tinto's underperformance relative to the rest of the sector is coming to an end,\" Cazenove said, predicting a substantial increase in earnings this year. </p> <p>\"Rio has good exposure to commodities [iron ore and copper] which would appear set for the best pricing momentum in 2005.\" </p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Capital Radio</strong> was one of the best FTSE 250 performers. Its shares gained 20p to 420p but traders were divided over the reason for the rise. Some attributed the strong performance to talk of a merger deal with Classic FM owner <strong>GWR</strong> , which advanced 4.25p to 255p. More sober market watchers reckoned the cause lay with with an upgrade from the media team at stockbroker Panmure. </p> <p>Shifting its recommendation to buy, Panmure said it was time to tune in to Capital shares, which have underperformed the media sector by 8% since the publication of disappointing audience figures at the end of July. </p> <p>\"At this level the stock now offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.6% which is well supported by a strong balance sheet. Furthermore, we believe downside is limited as it is likely to fuel further takeover speculation,\" Panmure said. </p> <p>Heading the other way was alternative telecoms company <strong>Thus</strong>, which fell 1p to 16p after a big shareholder dumped 32m shares - or 2.3% of the company - at 15p. </p> <p>There was also a late trade in serviced office group <strong>Regus</strong>. It closed unchanged at 66.75p. A line of 23.2m shares - about 2% of the company - went through the ticker at that price after the market closed. </p> <p>Among the smaller firms, renewed talk of a bid from the US helped <strong>Chemring</strong>, the airborne countermeasures specialist, improve 2p to 392.5p. </p> <p>On Aim, <strong>International Brand Licensing</strong>, the Admiral sportswear company, was unmoved at 31p despite concerns that the 9.5% stake held by chairman Lance Yates, who died at the weekend, might soon be sold. </p> <p>Talk of tough trading left <strong>Sky Capital</strong>, the mini-investment bank with offices in London and New York, 22.5p lower at 171p, while property group <strong>Your Space</strong> marked time at 2p as traders took a second look at Tuesday's full-year figures. Buried in the results statement was news that the firm had received a number of approaches from other companies, which it is actively pursuing. </p> <p><strong>Pursuit Dynamics</strong>, the pumps specialist, improved 6p to 148.5p on rumours of a deal with the Campbell Soup Company.</p>",
  "<p>It has been claimed we are just six contacts away from anyone in the world. This \"six degrees of separation\" indicates how powerful person-to-person networking can be when the right connections are made. But could computers work in a similar way? Could we harness enormous power by linking thousands of computers across the world? </p> <p>Yes, say the proponents of grid computing, the buzzword to describe huge virtual networks of computers, which is gradually becoming part of the IT landscape. </p> <p>Grid computing is, in essence, a form of distributed computing that coordinates and shares processing power, applications, data, storage or networked resources from multiple linked computers. </p> <p>This month's launch of the first permanent worldwide grid for science experimentation was the latest milestone in the march of the technology. Known as the Large Hadron Collider computing grid (LHC), it links 78 sites in various countries for research into particle physics. </p> <p>The LHC will process 15 petabytes of data per year - the equivalent of 7% of all printed matter worldwide. Its developers plan to expand it to 100,000 computers by 2007. </p> <p>But the big question for the computing industry is how quickly and effectively can grid computing be applied to business? Can what works for academic research become a commercial option? The advantages are clear: access to huge computing power using thousands of ordinary computers; and availability across a wide geographic area. By sharing resources, huge savings are possible. The grid also gives support to the idea that computing resources could be accessed like gas or electricity. </p> <p>But, there remain issues of protocols and standards for how such systems work. There are also sensitive commercial issues concerning how you parcel out and charge for processing jobs, and how secure a shared system can be. </p> <p>There are also concerns about reliability: while academics can work around periods where a grid is unavailable, commercial applications often rely on non-stop availability. </p> <p>Commercial applications can be found in reservoir modelling in the oil industry, structural analysis in aerospace and circuit simulation in electronics. However, an impact beyond such large-scale science projects has yet to materialise. </p> <p>Although grid computing is being heavily promoted by the likes of IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle, some believe that commercial applications are scaled-down versions of the real thing. </p> <p>\"We are at a very significant moment in the development of grid computing,\" says Dr Mark Parsons, commercial director of the National e-Science Centre (NeSC). \"The commercial development is much more conservative and tends to be made up of clusters of computers within an organisation. A real grid is greater than that. The next two years will determine how commercial the grid concept can become.\" </p> <p>Parsons believes the UK has a global leadership position in developing grids partly thanks to a five-year (2001-2006) government investment of \u00a3230m for grid computing. </p> <p>Funding has enabled Edikt (the e-Science Data, Information and Knowledge Transformation Centre) to develop its Eldas software, which enables the use of a grid to extract data from incompatible databases - for example, when two firms merge. </p> <p>\"This gives business the chance to leapfrog competitors by transforming their ability to extract and analyse data across an organisation,\" he says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the European Union has just allocated a \u20ac52m (\u00a335m) grant package for 12 grid research projects with the expressed aim of pulling grid computing beyond research labs and into industry. </p> <p>Mark Blowers, a senior research analyst at Butler Group, believes we are seeing the first steps of a new technology: \"It's early days. The fact is for a commercial application you have to do a lot of upfront work in terms of software development. That's alright for very large companies but too costly for many others.\" </p> <p>Alastair McAulay, a senior consultant on the PA Consulting Innovation Team, which recently carried out research into the commercial viability of grid computing for the Department of Trade and Industry, says that applications are limited. \"For the moment, it's going to be niche applications. A lot depends on how companies feel about their data moving beyond their own organisations. In finance, for example, they cannot take the risk, but in engineering there are clear applications that give greater processing power and make use of downtime.\" </p> <p>Perhaps most interestingly, one of the conclusions of PA's research is that government IT systems could benefit most. \"Some areas of government could well lead the field, for example in identity verification, where currently information is held in a number of databases. It could be very helpful in getting government departments to share data,\" says McAulay. </p> <p>Many predict this sharing of resources will hold back big business because it goes against the grain. \"It needs a cultural change because there are often silos of data in an organisation, and there can be organisational resistance to sharing processing power and data,\" says Philippe Bricard, of IBM grid computing in Europe.</p>",
  "<p>The government is taking steps to protect endangered \"strategic subjects\" of both national and regional importance, such as chemistry and minority languages, it was revealed yesterday.</p> <p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, told vice-chancellors he was looking at ways of preserving the subjects - under growing threat at many British universities - for the benefit of future generations \"and the country as a whole\".</p> <p>Mr Clarke also disclosed that his department is drawing up a new strategy to bring a much-needed international perspective to education, after admitting that its policies to date have failed to reflect the pressures of global competition on British universities in particular.</p> <p>Addressing the annual conference of the Universities UK umbrella group in Oxford, Mr Clarke told vice-chancellors that he wanted their views on \"how to put the world into world-class education\", after being warned that cash-strapped universities needed a huge influx of overseas students who attract higher fees - in addition to UK and European Union students - to guarantee their survival.</p> <p>Following growing concern about the closure of many specialist university departments in the wake of declining student take-up and the loss of public funding, Mr Clarke said he had asked members of the Cabinet to single out the subjects that they were concerned about, and said the government was \"still in the position of assessing those responses\". It was also consulting with the funding council Hefce, which regularly monitors those courses with less than 100 students throughout the country. </p> <p>\"I think there is a very real issue with strategic subjects, subjects which are of strategic national importance to the country as a whole. There are good examples of rational market decisions [by universities], which don't necessarily meet the wider national interest.\" </p> <p>Mr Clarke singled out Japanese, Far Eastern studies and chemistry, saying students wanting to study the latter in the West Midlands, for example, should be able to do so without being forced to travel further afield.</p> <p>Only 40 chemistry departments remain in British universities after a spate of closures. There was a case for giving special treatment to subjects which could not be taken into account by the demand-led system, either through new incentives to shore up student numbers or financial subsidies. </p> <p>He also acknowledged that the government's biggest higher education document to date - last year's white paper, which set out proposals for variable tuition fees of up to \u00a33,000 a year - failed to address the key issue of how universities would survive in the face of growing international competition from the Far East and the US. </p> <p>\"I think it's a fair criticism of the white paper that it did under-play the importance of the international agenda,\" said Mr Clarke, revealing that a new strategy will be set out in a public document next month.</p> <p>Earlier, Ivor Crewe, the president of UUK and vice-chancellor of Essex University, had told him that all new domestic policies should \"automatically\" focus on the implications for international competitiveness.</p> <p>Overseas students, who attracted significant extra fee income, were part of this equation, he said: \"The presence of international students ... is no longer an optional, mildly exotic, welcome ingredient of campus life. It is quite simply what makes it possible for the academic enterprise to continue.\" </p> <p>He cited data published this week by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which showed that although the number of international students in the UK had grown significantly, the UK's share of the overseas student market declined from 16% in 1998 to 12% in 2002.</p> <p>He was also concerned that the proposed new system of applying for university once students were armed with their results could discriminate against overseas students. He concluded: \"Competitiveness abroad and quality at home are inter-dependent and self-reinforcing. The government - and the sector - need to cultivate both, for all universities. In particular, together we need to develop our international competitiveness with more aggression and urgency. Success in doing so will not only serve British universities and their students well, but the UK's economy and its cultural standing and influence abroad. Failure to do so will lead to a spiral of decline for one of Britain's remaining world successes - its universities.\"</p>",

  "<p>Tax relief should be offered on sports activities in efforts to combat the rise in obesity, doctors said today. </p> <p>The Royal College of GPs (RCGP) called on the government to take action on obesity by making exercise affordable and accessible to everybody. </p> <p>They also said that healthier foods should be available in schools to tackle weight problems among youngsters. </p> <p>The call came as the government prepared to unveil its public health white paper which is expected to set out how it intends to halt the growing rates of obesity in adults and young children. </p> <p>The RCGP was today holding a conference to discuss the costs of obesity, what doctors can do to treat obese patients and prevent people becoming overweight in the first place. </p> <p>Rates of obesity among adults have almost quadrupled in the last 25 years, with 22% of Britons now thought to be obese.

  "<p>It is Saturday afternoon in Deauville and George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola are sitting in a hotel suite, pondering just what might have happened 35 years ago if THX 1138 - Lucas's first film as a director, made when he was only 25 - had been a success. Coppola is a little hungover. Lucas is sitting with his arms folded, looking thoughtful. </p> <p>The top brass at Warner Brothers were utterly bewildered by THX when they saw it in 1970. They were hoping for a sci-fi Easy Rider. What they got was an oblique, if beautifully made, experimental drama about totalitarianism and unbridled consumerism in the vein of Chris Marker's La Jet\u00e9e or Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville. They demanded re-cuts from Lucas (\"Put the freaks up front\" was their motto) and promptly withdrew their financing from American Zoetrope, the San Francisco-based film-making collective presided over by Coppola that had made the movie. </p> <p>\"I feel no bitterness whatsoever,\" Coppola says when asked about the decision to close down Zoetrope just when it was shaping up to become a counter-culture answer to United Artists - an outfit where visionary film-makers made personal movies without interference. \"Warner Bros lost more than I did in a way. Through the Zoetrope connection, they had the opportunity to work with all of those film-makers who would have been loyal to them.\" </p> <p>Zoetrope was indeed impressive. Along with Lucas and Coppola, it also provided a home to such combustible talents as John Milius, Carroll Ballard and Caleb Deschanel. Its collapse had unforeseen consequences. A few months after THX, Coppola (in desperate need of money) accepted a job at Paramount directing a film called The Godfather. Lucas briefly contemplated quitting but instead took a more commercial tack, making American Graffiti and Star Wars. </p> <p>\"Lo and behold, it opened up other avenues and opportunities for me. I thought I would try at least once before my career ended to make a traditional studio film with sets and shooting on sound stage - and that's what has led me to where I am now.\" </p> <p>The irony is self-evident: if Warner Bros had been more enthusiastic about THX, none of this would have happened. We might now be living in a world without Luke Skywalker or Don Corleone (at least as envisioned by Coppola). Warner Bros is belatedly making amends. The studio has paid for the restoration of THX, a painstaking process that took Lucas two years. (\"It cost more to restore the film than it did to make it,\" he says.) </p> <p>We're so accustomed to the idea of Lucas as Hollywood mogul that it comes as a surprise to discover that he still regards himself as the experimental film-maker battling against a system that wants to crush him. His original plan, when he enrolled at University of Southern California, was to \"become a documentary film-maker and make avant-garde films on the side\". </p> <p>THX began as a 15-minute student project, Electronic Labyrinth THX1138 - 4EB (1967). It was the story of a brave new world in which the citizens are sedated by mind-soothing drugs. Sex is forbidden and children are conceived artificially. \"There is no evil in THX. Evil doesn't exist,\" says Lucas. \"Everybody is nice. Everything is wonderful ... but immediately you sense this is not the place you want to live.\" </p> <p>The actors have shaven heads, which make them look like concentration camp inmates. They dress in white. Much of the film is set against bleached white backdrops. When we see prisoners cowering at the feet of cops wielding huge electrified batons, it's hard not to think of the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison. </p> <p>What makes THX so unsettling is its ambiguity. The film could be read as a cold war satire about Soviet-style totalitarianism, were it not for the fact that western consumerism dominates the world that THX (Robert Duvall) rebels against after beginning an illicit affair with LUH (Maggie McOmie). </p> <p>Lucas (who describes the film as a \"parable of 1970\") acknowledges that THX was a direct reaction to the Vietnam war. \"You lived with it. You couldn't avoid it. A lot of us had gone through the problems of being subject to the draft, which is pretty totalitarian - if you don't want to do something and the government makes you, that's pretty strong stuff. That was the environment in which THX and Star Wars were made.\" </p> <p>On one level, the film is autobiographical, too. It's Lucas's version of Fellini's I Vitelloni, a story about someone prepared to escape his stifling, claustrophobic background. \"I was always very conscious that I left my home town [Modesto], went to film school against everybody's advice and followed my instincts,\" Lucas says. </p> <p>For Coppola, the film's attack on consumerism is even more relevant now than it was in 1970. \"There are things in the film that are even more accurate today as commercials and advertising bombard us to make us feel inadequate so we will buy things.\" </p> <p>Isn't there an irony in the director of the Star Wars trilogy and the founder of LucasArtsLicencing, which earned a fortune from merchandising, lecturing us on the perils of consumerism? \"Well, probably,\" Lucas cheerily replies. According to him, all those Darth Vader toys weren't just about making money but about sparking children's imaginations. \"Toys give children the chance to extend the experience from the movie theatre into reality. They could take those toys, play and tell different stories. They could build fantasy worlds.\" </p> <p>Even now, Coppola and Lucas still seem to see themselves as outsiders in Hollywood. Coppola, who is old enough to remember working with Jack Warner, sees Heaven's Gate (the film that bankrupted United Artists) as the moment when the barbarians took over. All of a sudden, directors had to answer to a small army of studio executives who had an opinion about every aspect of any given movie, from cast right down to design. Lucas calls this \"the Thalberg syndrome\" after Irving Thalberg, the legendary but highly manipulative \"Boy Wonder\" who pulled the strings at MGM in the 1930s. </p> <p>Since Hollywood has been taken over by the \"middle managers\", as he witheringly calls them, Lucas argues that the studios have been \"making hugely inefficient movies for great amounts of money and they aren't creatively very interesting. Any studio you go to, you're going to find 30 executives working on your picture.\" </p> <p>When Coppola bemoans the trend for sequels, Lucas chimes in with \"That's even worse!\", seemingly oblivious to the fact that he has made half a dozen Star Wars films himself. He sees Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as one of the few film-makers who has escaped its manacles. \"When you're in New Zealand, it's hard for them to get you.\" </p> <p>To outsiders, it has long seemed that Lucas has carte blanche to do whatever he wants. If that is the case, he insists it is only because he fought so hard. \"It started out with Francis giving me that freedom [on THX]. I got successful enough so that I could do it myself. Now I have reached a point where I've got enough money and can do whatever I want, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent. It's my money that's at stake.\" He is now going to return to his roots and make more films in the vein of THX. Whether they make money or not doesn't worry him. </p> <p>THX is the one George Lucas movie that has drifted close to obscurity - he wants to rescue it for a new generation that knows him only through Star Wars. To accompany the DVD release, Warners has paid for a new documentary about American Zoetrope. \"It's the first time we film-makers have had a chance to talk about it. A lot of what has been written has been completely false. It's rumours and innuendos and gossip - but it was a noble experiment.\" </p> <p>You can't help but sense a feeling of nostalgia in Lucas for that heady period in late-1960s San Francisco when he was part of a radical filmmaking movement. As the film's sound editor and co-writer Walter Murch remarks: \"Star Wars is a big burden he'll be happy to leave behind. Fate is kind - and fickle. In an ideal world, real film-makers would have enough success with one movie to then make another. But it doesn't work out that way. Either you make a film that's a complete failure - or it's so successful that it distorts everything that comes after it.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Director's Cut THX 1138 is out now.</p>",

  "<p>The steel group Corus today announced pre-tax profits of \u00a3163m for the six months to the end of June - its first interim profits since its formation in 1999.</p> <p>Formerly British Steel, the company - which was formed when British Steel merged with the Dutch producer Hoogovens - lost \u00a389m a year ago, and has accumulated losses of \u00a31bn and axed thousands of jobs in five years. </p> <p>Its turnaround has come on the back of soaring steel prices, fuelled by a booming Chinese economy. Propelled by a 25% growth in demand for steel in China, global demand has risen by 6-7% in each of the last two years, and Corus imposed price increases of between 15% and 18% in the first half. </p> <p>The company's chief executive, Philippe Varin, who took over last year, said there had been a \"substantial improvement\" in the performance of the business. </p> <p>\"Based on a combination of further restructuring, previously announced price increases and continued tight market conditions, the board expects that the progress in operating profit and margins will continue in the second half of 2004,\" he said in a statement. </p> <p>Corus, Europe's third biggest steel maker, also made \u00a3220m in annual cost savings imposed by its restoring success programme. The initiative is also intended to sharpen the company's focus by selling off non-essential assets such as a north American services centre. </p> <p>Mr Varin, who is concentrating the group's efforts on carbon steel, wants to sell its profitable aluminium business to either a private equity house or a trade buyer. The business could fetch around \u00a3666m, although its sale has been put back to next year because of changes in the European aluminium industry.</p> <p>Despite the recent progress, Mr Varin wants to close a 6% gap in profit margins between Corus and its main European competitors by 2006. Although Corus margins have risen from 3.5% last year to 6-7%, the company's main rivals have also benefited from the boom in demand. </p> <p>Uncertainty still surrounds the future of its Teesside plant, which employs 2,000 people but had previously been earmarked to operate as a stand alone company, possibly in a joint venture.

  "While it is heartening to read of Tony Blair's realisation that climate change fuelled by greenhouse gas emissions is a real and present danger (Blair calls for UK to lead on climate change, September 15), it is all the more unforgivable that he has failed to deliver the far-reaching and specific policy commitments that are urgently needed to address it. <p>If he really hopes to exercise global leadership on tackling climate change, he must put his own house in order first. The UK still lags far behind many of its European neighbours: we will spend some \u00a39m on solar panels this year, compared to Germany's \u00a366m last year, for example. </p> <p>Since his own chief scientific adviser has warned that climate change is a far greater threat than terrorism, Blair has no excuse for not expending at least the same resources on tackling it as he has spent on Iraq. <br> <b>Dr Caroline Lucas MEP</b><br> Green party, South-east England </p> <p>The real challenge about climate change is how we deal with the energy needs of big urban areas, such as London.

The answer is to generate more of our energy locally, for example with smaller urban wind turbines. </p> <p>Cities will be the key to success in tackling climate change. If we can tackle the energy needs of our large conurbations, then we will be able to meet our international targets for reducing carbon emissions. <br> <b>Nicky Gavron</b><br> Deputy mayor, London </p> <p>It is not climate change that poses the greatest threat to humanity but the idea that the environment should be valued independently of its worth to man and in contradiction to his interest, treating the man-made as if it is unnatural. </p> <p>The climate has undergone severe disruptions without the presence of humans over millions of years and there is no objective evidence that humans are causing disruptions today. Take, for instance, the cooling trend in the lower five miles of the atmosphere, detected by weather balloons and independently confirmed by Nasa's orbiting satellites.

  "Oi! Chicken breath,\" a sergeant barks from the barrack gym. Groups of squaddies are being put through their paces at the army school of physical training in Aldershot. It hurts just to look. <p>As he hurtles up the steep folds of the beech woods near Aldershot, in Hampshire, the entirely sweat-free Sergeant Paddy Paton calmly discusses how he is required to do 77 press-ups in two minutes, 72 sit-ups and then go for two 45-minute runs every day. Fast. </p> <p>It is these images of uncompromising endurance that the army hopes will bring victory in its first ever foray into the tough terrain of global capitalism. With UK Gear, a tiny sportswear manufacturer from the Midlands, the army yesterday launched the PT-03, a running shoe that is named after its \"physical training\" and proudly bears the insignia of the British army on its tongue. </p> <p>More than 65m pairs of trainers are sold in Britain every year. Rather than buy trainers endorsed by Michael Jordan, the army and UK Gear hope that serious runners will buy the army-endorsed PT-03, which has been tested to destruction by the army's 450 full-time physical training instructors as they pounded up and down the land during the past eight months. </p> <p>Staggering through the woods next to the physical training school, the gentlemen of Fleet Street fared less well than the PT-03s they were testing. Sergeant Paton has run 80 miles a week in the trainers for the last four months. </p> <p>\"Do you know what we call HILLS?\" he barked cheerily as we struggled up a gentle incline in our PT-03s. \"Hi, I Love Little Inclines.\" </p> <p>Bringing up the rear, the man from the Times turned beetroot and, while the light, bouncy shoes felt comfortable, they hardly turned your distinctly under-muscled correspondent into the new Kelly Holmes, let alone a man fit for combat. </p> <p>The army is pitching its brand into a uniquely competitive market. The push to design the perfect trainer, and sell it by the shed-load, is the global sportswear manufacturer's arms race. </p> <p>Year zero was 1979, when Nike started the revolution by putting air in its soles. It set the tone for ever-more sophisticated shoes, boasting \"energy return systems\" or ultra-light absorbing gels. Brands such as Adidas were then adopted by new trendsetters in hip-hop, turning serious sports shoes into mainstream fashion accessories. </p> <p>Nike and Adidas led the way in volume of sales, but serious runners remained notoriously conservative, unimpressed by endorsements and advertising campaigns. The low-profile Asics are the leading \"serious\" brand, with some 40% of athletes wearing their trainers at races. </p> <p>According to Colonel Robin Clifford, director of international defence training in the army, the army has been actively seeking to \"exploit\" its \"image and reputation\" since the government unveiled the concept of \"wider markets\" in 1998. A Treasury-led initiative, it urged all government departments to generate extra income from \"spare capacity\", including real estate and, crucially, intellectual property rights such as images and brands. </p> <p>\"It became apparent that a number of people were using and exploiting the army image for commercial gain,\" said Col Clifford. \"This [trainer] was exactly the sort of thing we were looking for to act as a pilot and use the army's expertise practically.\" </p> <p>Col Clifford accepts the PT-03 is a risky venture. While the army has not invested any money in the shoes, it will gain a \"normal royalty\" from the sale of every pair. </p> <p>However, it would be deeply embarrassed if its fledgling attempt to market its brand ended in commercial failure. UK Gear, best known for making cricket kit for the West Indies, is a minnow. The firm recruited designers from bigger brands in the PT-03's \"six figure\" design process, but employs just seven people. </p> <p>The trainers are not, however, a model of military grit. The manufacturers insist they are not made in a sweatshop but they are produced in Vietnam. And while the PT-03s are being tested for their suitability for army procurement, they will not yet be an official piece of kit issued to all soldiers. </p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Phil Watkins, the army's most senior physical training instructor, is convinced they will be a success. He first wore the shoes six months ago for a double mountain marathon. \"I took them out of the box, put them on and whilst they are not designed for fell running, they performed well. Cross-country, they were superb. I didn't get a single blister.\" He has been training in them ever since. </p> <p>Other soldiers also approve. \"They are better than our Hi-Tech Silver Shadows,\" said one sergeant - although that is hardly a ringing endorsement given that the army-issue Hi-Techs date from the 1980s and sell for just \u00a320. </p> <p>While the PT-03 boasts the usual range of baffling, apparently pseudo-scientific features, from the royal air mesh to the \"2nd density EVA compound for enhanced medial motion control\" in its heel, experts suggest it is a respectable competitor in an increasingly scientific field. </p> <p>\"There is a huge amount of science behind running shoes now,\" said Andy Barber, deputy editor of Running Fitness magazine. \"If you go into any of the global HQs of the major sports manufacturers you are looking at something like a laboratory. It is a mix of science and art.\" </p> <p>Although the PT-03 does not propel unfit journalists up hills, its success, according to Mr Barber, will depend on whether the army's brand is enough to persuade naturally conservative runners to switch from their tried-and-trusted trainers. \"It is not a shoe you would wear in a nightclub, but then core runners will like it because they are averse to gimmicks and gadgetry.\"</p>",
  "<p>As he strode the back nine at Oaklands Hills yesterday, Colin Montgomerie found himself awash in the milk of human kindness. In a country that has often sent him away nursing bitter memories, almost every one of the 30,000 spectators following the practice rounds seemed to have an encouraging word for the man who will lead Europe's attempt to retain the Ryder Cup this weekend. </p> <p>American voices joined the British visitors in making him feel welcome, and he responded with smiles, waves and a dozen autographs on the way to every tee. When five men in kilts and saltire T-shirts appeared on the 12th green, he linked arms with them and posed for photographers. </p> <p>On the tee at the short 13th he took a poster of the European team from an Austrian spectator and went over to get Luke Donald and Paul Casey to sign it. And when his tee-shot splashed down in a greenside bunker, even the American spectators groaned. </p> <p>Much of the favourable commentary, however, was uttered out of the Scot's earshot. </p> <p>\"If you didn't know it was him,\" one middle-aged American said to another in the throng surrounding the 11th green, \"from this angle you'd never know it was Montgomerie.\" </p> <p>\"No way,\" his friend agreed. </p> <p>Many others could be heard voicing the same surprise, with a note of new respect in their voices. This, after all, is the land of the Atkins Diet, the Beverly Hills diet, and almost every other means of cosmetic weight reduction ever devised. And even though he could not hear the murmured approval, Montgomerie is well aware that people are looking at him in a different light as a result of his extraordinary feat in losing about 36lb in the two months since the Open championship, eliminating the comfortable embonpoint that drew unkind comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire. </p> <p>\"I decided to try and lose a bit of weight,\" he said yesterday, \"and it worked. You see the scale go down a pound, and the willpower goes in the opposite direction. But it hasn't affected my golf in any way. I just feel a little bit better about myself, and self-esteem and confidence are huge in this game, especially when you're out in public an awful lot. </p> <p>\"Whether it helps the team or not can only be seen on Sunday. If I gain some points, of course it will help the team. But it wasn't done for the team cause on this occasion.\" </p> <p>No amateur psychologist could resist making the obvious connection between the weight loss and some sort of personal reassessment following the breakdown of Montgomerie's marriage. His divorce was finalised last week, while he was missing the cut in Cologne, and although he quite properly refused to discuss it yesterday, there was a half-concealed pathos in his answer to a question about how he and his team-mates are spending their time this week. </p> <p>\"We have a good group together,\" he said, \"and I'm talking about the 25 of us this week in the team environment.\" In other words the captain and his wife, 11 players and their wives and girlfriends, and Montgomerie, whose ex-wife, Eimear, was a part of so many Ryder Cup adventures. </p> <p>Doubtless that will be on his mind tonight during the elaborate ritual of the opening ceremony. No other sport makes the competitors' consorts into so public a part of the event, costumed and paraded like trophies. There will be a great deal of sympathy for Montgomerie, who said recently that if the price of winning the European order of merit seven years in a row was a shattered marriage, then his advice to anyone else contemplating it would be not to bother. </p> <p>Not that he needs sympathy when it comes to his seventh appearance in the Ryder Cup. His overall record of 16 wins, seven losses and five halved matches is impressive enough, but his streak in the singles matches is what has made him so extraordinary a contributor to the European cause. </p> <p>Of his six head-to-head matches, two - against Mark Calcavecchia in 1991 and Scott Hoch in 1997 - have been halved. The remaining four - against Lee Janzen in 1993, Ben Crenshaw in 1995, Payne Stewart in 1999 and Hoch in 2002 - were all won, the victory at The Belfry two years ago counting as perhaps the finest of the thousands of days Montgomerie has spent on a golf course. </p> <p>When Sam Torrance sent him out to lead Europe's attack on the final day's singles, Montgomerie responded by destroying Hoch's challenge and setting the tone for the rest of the team. It sealed his special relationship with the competition, and may in some measure have given him compensation for his career-long failure to win a major tournament. </p> <p>At 41, he is now a very long shot indeed to rectify that omission. \"I've been quite close on a number of occasions,\" he said. \"I just haven't managed to walk through a half-open door, unfortunately. It's one of those things. If the golfing gods smile on me one day, it might well happen. But I'll have played seven of these Ryder Cups and I have a reasonable record. If that's my legacy, I'll be very glad to take it with me.\" </p> <p>In one respect, however, this time is not quite the same. \"I qualified without qualifying,\" he pointed out. After an undistinguished season on the European tour, winning only a single tournament while his mind wandered elsewhere, he arrived in Detroit as one of captain Bernhard Langer's picks. </p> <p>\"It is different,\" he said, \"but I feel very much part of the team. The others have supported me tremendously. I knew that I had nothing to prove to Bernhard. We've played together in these matches since 1991, so he knows what I can do in this situation.\" </p> <p>Many believe the collective nature of Ryder Cup play brings a different dimension to the play of a man whose seven seasons at the top of the European standings were the product of the single-minded concentration, bordering on selfishness, that characterises all great golfers. Yesterday he chose a dramatic way of expressing the thought that, in terms of individual satisfaction, the tournament has no significance at all. </p> <p>\"Personally, this event means absolutely nothing to me,\" he said, calmly surveying the rows of astonished faces. \"Never has. And actually never will, personally. I'm here as part of a team. Bernhard felt that I could help his team gain the 14 points that we require to win. That's my job this week. It doesn't matter who attains the points. So my personal record in this event is meaningless to me. </p> <p>\"You're playing not just for your country or your continent but, more importantly, for your 11 other team-mates and your captain. We're used to letting ourselves down on a regular basis, but in this situation you don't want to let down the other guys who've tried and qualified and are giving their all as well. </p> <p>\"I'm here in many roles this week, I suppose. Hopefully I can prove myself on the golf course and off it for the team cause.\" </p> <p><strong>Proud record of Europe's tiger </strong></p> <p>1991 Kiawah Island </p> <p>Pts 1 Europe lost 14-13</p> <p>Montgomerie and David Gilford were paired for the opening foursomes because both were hitting the ball straight from the tee but they lost out to Lanny Wadkins and Hale Irwin 4&amp;2 and it was with Bernhard Langer the next day that the Scot won his first point, the pair combining in fourballs to beat Steve Pate and Corey Pavin 2&amp;1.

  "<p>Carlos Ribagorda does not appear to be a man who suffers from learning difficulties; a journalist for a Spanish business magazine, he has just published a book on young rightwing politicians. Four years ago, however, he won a Paralympic gold medal in Sydney as a member of Spain's learning-disabled basketball team. </p> <p>A few weeks later Ribagorda sent his medal back to the Paralympic headquarters in Bonn. He also returned his Spanish team kit and the \u00a3150 spending money he had been given. For, he explained, he was just one of 10 members of the 12-man squad who had absolutely nothing wrong with them. He had simply been \"signed up\" to boost his country's chances of winning a medal. His revelations shocked the Paralympics - held every four years by the city that hosts the full Olympics - shredding its image as the benevolent moment of the international sporting calendar. </p> <p>The shockwaves are still being felt and athletes with learning difficulties have been banned from competing in the Athens Paralympics, which start tomorrow. </p> <p>In the Paralympics, just as in the Olympics, people cheat. It was not just the Spanish basketball team that was stuffed with frauds in Sydney, according to Ribagorda. Two swim mers on the Spanish team as well as a table tennis player and at least one track and field athlete were not, as they claimed, learning disabled, he says. Complaints, inevitably, began to spread. \"There were two or three players from both Spain and Russia who could have competed in our national basketball league,\" complained one Australian coach. \"What they did with, and without, the ball was way above what any of our athletes could have achieved.\" Ribagorda, who helped beat the Russians in the final, agreed. \"There were three players in the Russian team, especially one of them, who were just too good.\" </p> <p>Ribagorda says he was invited to train in Madrid with the basketball team five months before the Sydney games and saw an opportunity for a journalistic scoop. \"There were five months of training with not a single disabled person in sight. The two genuinely disabled players came from outside Madrid.\" </p> <p>Some of his new team-mates had already been to a world championship in Brazil. Ribagorda himself went to Portugal with the team. But the big prize was Sydney. \"I think people saw it as a free trip to Australia. There was even some pride at wearing the Spanish team strip.\" </p> <p>In their first match, the team played too well and, when more than 30 points ahead at half-time, were ordered by their coach to slow down their scoring and let the other team shoot more. But their biggest mistake was to win gold - part of a haul that put Spain third in the medal table behind the US and Britain. A photo appeared on the front page of the popular Madrid sports daily, Marca. Rumours began to circulate that some players, including the coach of an amateur team, had been recognised, as people without learning difficulties. They were advised by officials to wear dark glasses and hats and grow beards in order to pass unnoticed at the team's triumphal return home at Madrid's Barajas airport. Then Ribagorda blew the whistle. The halo of saintliness that accompanies the Paralympics, which started out at Stoke Mandeville hospital as the International Wheelchair games in 1948, lost its shine. It was a startling reversal for a \u00a329m event which Australians had supported with heart-warming enthusiasm, buying 1.2 million tickets . </p> <p>Fingers soon began to point at one of the most powerful men worldwide in the field of disabled sport, Fernando Mart\u00edn Vicente. A former Madrid city councillor, he was a member of the International Paralympic Committee's (IPC) ruling executiveand vice-president of Spain's Paralympic committee. He was also head of one of the six international federations of disabled athletes that make up the Paralympic family INAS-FID - the International Sports Organisation for Persons with an Intellectual Disability. </p> <p>In 1975 Vicente, the father of a disabled child, founded the National Association of Special Sports (Ande), dedicated to disabled sports. Every year it reportedly received huge sums of state cash. </p> <p>While Ande grew, Vicente's personal wealth also increased. El Mundo newspaper tried, but failed, to prove that there was a connection, claiming his wealth had reached \u00a35m. Martin, it said, owned a yacht, eight cars, including a Porsche, five houses and half a dozen large pieces of land. </p> <p>Vicente protested his innocence, then resigned. His case is now in the Spanish courts. Contacted by the Guardian yesterday, he angrily denied making money from disabled sports. \"It is very sad. There was no bad intent,\" he insisted before adding that he, as head of INAS-FID, had been too important to get involved in checking the credentials of individual players. </p> <p>The IPC eventually set up its own investigating committee. \"It was only just this sport,\" explains IPC media director Miriam Wilkens. \"It was just the Spanish team.\" But all learning disabled athletes were banned until INAS-FID could come up with a way of making sure there was no further cheating. Its proposals have, so far, fallen short of what the IPC wants. </p> <p>\"A lot of athletes around the world are devastated by that,\" says Nick Parr, chief executive of the English Sports Association for People with Learning Difficulties. \"This goes beyond disappointment. They have trouble understanding. There are English athletes who think that, as they are being punished, they must have done something wrong.\" He worries that people with learning difficulties may now be permanently excluded from the games, insisting \"as long as there is a system in place, there is no reason why the athletes should not compete in the Paralympics.\" </p> <p>The Paralympics, however, is not the only international sports organisation for learning-disabled athletes. The International Olympic Committee has also given its backing to a separate games for them - the Special Olympics. </p> <p>\"The Special Olympics is not an elitist sports organisation. People of all levels of ability can compete,\" says Kirsten Suto, its spokeswoman in Washington. \"The philosophy is all about doing one's own personal best.\" In practical terms, that means dividing athletes into divisions so they compete against those of similar ability and, if they improve, can move up a division to compete against more capable athletes. \"We like the spirit of competition, but we don't focus on medal counts, or countries doing best. We focus on the individual and their accomplishment.\" </p> <p>The Sydney scandal provoked \"sadness\", says Suto. \"We are always sad when people aren't true sportsmen and don't take sports seriously by faking and ridiculing it.\" </p> <p>Even though athletes with learning difficulties are barred en masse from Athens,we are unlikely to have seen the end of Paralympic cheating. The Sydney games also turned up 11 doping cases. Medals were taken away from, among others, the American runner Brian Frasure and the Azerbaijani powerlifter Gundus Ismailov. Ismailov had been taking both nandrolone, an anabolic steroid, and methandienone. Frasure, billed as \"the world's fastest amputee\", had also been taking nandrolone. At the winter Paralympics two years ago in Salt Lake City, Germany's skier Thomas Oelsner had to return two gold medals after a doping scandal. </p> <p>One of the mottoes for the Athens Paralympics is \"spirit in motion\". Organisers and, above all, the 4,000 athletes from 143 nations will be hoping that, for the next 11 days of competition, nothing more is done to deflate that spirit.</p>",
  "<p>Australia's clash with New Zealand at The Oval today can belatedly bring the Champions Trophy to life. It needs to, because a damaging combination of English impotence and international presumptuousness has so far heaped embarrassment upon the game. </p> <p>After more than a week of mismatches before meagre crowds, Australia and New Zealand play the first of what are essentially four quarter-finals between the best eight sides in the world. The business end of the tournament arrives not so much with anticipation whetted, rather as a blessed relief. </p> <p>Stephen Fleming, the Kiwis' captain, put it succinctly. \"There is some fantastic cricket to come. Hopefully we haven't pushed too many people away with one-sided games.\" </p> <p>England's hosting of the Champions Trophy as an add-on to a heavy international programme smacked of overkill from the start. But few can have imagined that, having won the rights to run a prestigious tournament, the hosts would virtually ignore it. From the moment the Edgbaston opening ceremony amounted to a couple of handshakes, it was clear it was in trouble. </p> <p>The handshakes, admittedly, were a slight improvement on the 1999 World Cup, which involved Tony Blair, a dud microphone and a dodgy box of fireworks. But it is an odd tournament where the warm-up matches - three ODIs between India and England - are promoted more enthusiastically than the real thing. </p> <p>Elsewhere, preparations have been shoddy. Australia and New Zealand were resentful over the lack of practice facilities at The Oval yesterday - they decamped to Finchley. Sri Lanka will face England at the Rose Bowl tomorrow still harbouring grudges over the poor quality of the ECB XI provided for their warm-up at Shenley last week. </p> <p>But now, if the weather holds, something better awaits. Ricky Ponting, Australia's captain, billed today's meeting as \"the first big match of the tournament\". </p> <p>\"New Zealand are a good side - we understand and respect that fact,\" he said. \"They have won a lot of one-day games of late and tend to lift a gear when they play Australia.\" </p> <p>The Kiwis have won 13 of their past 14, but they have to go back to January 2002, in Adelaide, for the last time they beat Australia. Since then they have lost six in a row, including a TVS Cup match in Faridabad when they were bowled out for 97. </p> <p>BBC Asia confirmed yesterday it will give ball-by-ball commentary on Saturday's India-Pakistan game, which sold out months ago, and it is Britain's Asian communities where interest in this tournament has proved deepest. Indeed it is India, where cricket matters more than anything, where egos are most flattered by talk of global expansion. </p> <p>There are sound reasons for spreading the game in a sensible fashion; cricket's post-war closed shop did it no favours. But if the ICC's global expansion plans involve wishful thinking, they do the game a disservice. Both Australia and New Zealand prepared for today's game by thrashing the US - a country that qualified for a major tournament before it has developed a coaching network or built a stadium. </p> <p>If it was only the US that fell below par then we could all smile benignly, express delight at their very presence and find cricketing satisfaction elsewhere. But the ICC must also contend with the faltering standards of some countries already given international status. Kenya, freak World Cup semi-finalists, have followed it up with a match-fixing scandal and financial mismanagement; in Bangladesh, floods returned to Dhaka yesterday; and in Zimbabwe, poor, blighted Zimbabwe, the ICC needs a miracle.</p>",
  "<b>Financial Times</b> <br> Editorial, September 15 <p>\"Predictions of the potentially dire effects of climate change pile up, not least from Tony Blair. [Tuesday's] warning from the prime minister ... came not only as competition for the green vote in next year's election heats up but also as the season for Caribbean hurricanes, a long-standing phenomenon that could none the less be aggravated by global warming, is under way. </p> <p>\"Yet it is hard to see many other leaders joining Mr Blair in giving high priority to the reduction of greenhouse gases ... Compliancy is widespread ... None the less ... he intended to use his chairmanship next year of [the G8 group of industrialised countries] to try to get progress on climate change. A first step would be acceptance of the scientific evidence in which President George Bush, notably, refuses to believe.\" </p> <p><b>Michael Hanlon</b><br> Daily Mail, September 15 </p> <p>\"When it comes to climate change, evidence counts for little and emotion counts for all ... There is no doubt that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere has risen in the past century, and there is little doubt, too, that human activities are to blame ... In any case, our dependency on fossil fuels, particularly for the production of electricity, is getting mankind into all sorts of trouble ... </p> <p>\"If Mr Blair really is planning a revival in nuclear power - which, despite the misguided hysteria, is by far the safest and greenest form of generating power - such a policy would be to his credit.\" </p> <p><b>Simon Jenkins</b><br> Times, September 15 </p> <p>\"Mr Blair clearly regards the Earth's temperature as yet another public service in the portfolio of Her Majesty's government ... If they really believe in the apocalypse, only one technology is currently available to hold it at bay and that is nuclear power ... So did Mr Blair couple his predictions of doom with plans for a new generation of nuclear stations to replace those being decommissioned after 2008? No, he did not ... He is standing by his pledge to cut Britain's CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions by 20% by 2012 and increase to 20% over 15 years the renewables component in Britain's generating mix ... [But] Mr Blair has no way of meeting these targets ...

That means we still need back-up from traditional sources for power ... Ironically, the effect of expanding wind power capacity is therefore to decrease the efficiency with which we run our fossil-fuel stations, which have to go on standby when the wind is just right.\" </p> <p><b>Lord May</b><br> Daily Telegraph, September 15  </p> <p>\"Nuclear power is an unpopular child of the energy family ... But we should not be afraid to point out that, as an energy source, it is relatively 'climate-friendly' [and] as such, should be given serious consideration. Keeping the nuclear option open should not be seen as a trade-off with support for renewable energy. Britain must do a better job of reaching its targets for renewables and reducing the wasteful use of energy. And there is security in a diversity of supply. In the short to medium term, it is difficult to see how we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels without the help of nuclear power ... </p> <p>\"Given that it takes about 10 years from the commissioning of a nuclear power station to it providing electricity, Britain would need to start building significant nuclear capacity, taking full advantage of the technical advances that have taken place elsewhere in the world while we have turned our backs on this technology.\"</p>",
  "Chris Patten has always had a colourful turn of phrase, and he treated the European parliament to a few well-chosen ones about transatlantic relations yesterday. The man who livened up Conservative politics with language like \"gobsmacked\" and \"double whammy\" told MEPs that a combination of \"testosterone and superciliousness\" was not an adequate way of approaching grave global problems. Diplomatic to a fault, the EU's outgoing commissioner for external relations did not spell out who he meant, though he did note pointedly that Americans and Europeans deserved better. The irritation he has occasionally caused in George Bush's Washington is evidence of the same bullish political courage he once showed as the last colonial governor of Hong Kong. <p>Mr Patten now has just a few weeks left before he ends his five-year term on Romano Prodi's team in Brussels and heads for a quieter life as chancellor of Oxford University. He has repeatedly argued that Europe needs to do much more to get its act together on the world stage, and can point to some success in the Balkans, though not in many other places. Progress, he admitted, had been made by \"lurches and shuffles\" rather than leaps and bounds. He has also rightly asked what a Europe that is unhappy with rampant US unilateralism is prepared to actually do if and when the use of force is required. \"How,\" as he put it in Strasbourg, \"do we intend to go about not just draining the swamps in which terrorism breeds but also shooting some of the crocodiles?\" But neither Russia nor Israel, he observed, should violate human rights in their legitimate fight against terrorism. </p> <p>The most committed pro-European Tory of his generation reserved his most scathing words for the US-led and British-backed war on Iraq. \"Liberation rapidly turned into a brutally resisted occupation,\" he said. \"Democracy failed to roll out like an oriental carpet across the thankless deserts of the Middle East.\" Such honest and articulate good sense must not be allowed to disappear from the European political scene.</p>",
  "<p>A promise by the prime minister to step up action to tackle climate change was postponed by a few months just the next day.</p> <p>In a speech in London on Tuesday, Mr Blair said that the government would the next day set out details of the review of the UK's climate change programme, \"to see if it is achieving the necessary progress towards our short-term and long-term emissions targets, and if not, to see how we can do better\". </p> <p>Although Margaret Beckett, the environment secretary, was in the audience, her department seemed unaware of the review when journalists requested a copy yesterday. </p> <p>Instead, later in the day, it offered not a review but the terms of reference for a review, and consultation which will take months to undertake. </p> <p>In a statement, Ms Beckett said last night: \"I am fully committed to this review and would like to see stakeholders at the centre of the programme, helping us develop and implement cost-effective measures that cut emissions.\" </p> <p>There will be a formal consultation exercise later this autumn and a revised programme published in the first half of 2005. </p> <p>The terms of reference for the review are to evaluate existing measures to reduce carbon dioxide and update projections of future emissions. </p> <p>This will reveal whether the UK will meet its legally binding target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% and carbon dioxide by 20%.</p>",
  "<p>This time last year, small bands of people up and down the country went on the hunt for some trees. Their task was to find the last of a magnificent species that once covered Britain in its tens of millions; a species that can now only boast a few thousand in number, remnants of a population ravaged by disease some four decades ago. </p> <p>The search for the last of the elms, set up by the Natural History Museum in London, captured the imagination of the country's amateur naturalists who came out in their hundreds to help. The project not only located hundreds of previously unrecorded elms, it also energised attempts by some scientists to re-introduce the tree to the British countryside. </p> <p>So successful was the hunt that the museum has decided to run it again - the bigger and better version starts next week. </p> <p>Dutch elm disease (which was named after the country the scientists who discovered it came from) was first seen in France in 1918 and became widespread in the United Kingdom 10 years later. By the 1960s, the most potent form of the fungus, Ophiostoma ulmi, had infested and killed some 20m elms. The fungus grows inside the trunk of the tree and slowly chokes the channels that transport water and nutrients between the roots and the leaves. </p> <p>Some trees survived. And the scientists at the Natural History Museum wanted to find and study them to work out why. </p> <p>Locating the country's remaining elms is also a crucial conservation task. Ancient elms are mini ecosystems in their own right. About 200 species of lichen have been observed growing on mature trees. The pale grey oyster mushroom and bright yellow velvet shank both have strong preferences for elms. The caterpillars of the white-letter hairstreak butterfly exclusively eats the leaves and buds of the trees and some thirty moth species use it as their main host plant. </p> <p>Knowing where the trees are is a crucial part of the monitoring for this huge variety of flora and fauna, many of which have been marked as conservation priorities since the devastating loss of so many elms 30 to 40 years ago. </p> <p>Finding enough of the remaining trees was an impossible task for the small team of scientists from the museum, alone. So, in collaboration with the Ramblers' Association, they issued the country's dedicated walkers with guides on how to identify the three types of elm - English, wych and smooth-leaved - with an intent to map the remaining elms. </p> <p>\"We didn't really know what we were going to get last year,\" says Gill Stevens, a biodiversity coordinator at the Natural History Museum, of the ramblers' involvement. </p> <p>What the scientists got was an impressive set of records of 222 previously uncharted elms. The biggest (and probably oldest) tree found was a 50-foot wych elm in Cotherstone, County Durham, larger than the arm span of four adults around its base. More than 445 elm records were added to the database, of which 25% were categorised as large trees. </p> <p>\"There was this feeling that elms had been decimated from the landscape and we were surprised at how many big elms we found,\" says Stevens. </p> <p>Producing the map of elms in Britain also had a direct benefit for the Conservation Foundation, the charity founded in 1982 by David Bellamy and David Shreeve, which is running a project to grow and, perhaps, re-introduce elms to the countryside. </p> <p>\"The foundation started to take cuttings from pure surviving native elm trees, that's English and Wych elm, six years ago,\" says Libby Symon, a project coordinator at the foundation, which has an office at the Royal Geograpical Society in Kensington, London. \"These have already been planted out.\" </p> <p>The foundation's plan is to grow the elms in strictly controlled batches and then plant them back out in the wild. There, they will be monitored for several decades. \"This is an ongoing experiment because not until these young trees are 15-20 years will we know if they show any resistance [to Dutch elm disease]. What we want to know is, after 20 years, are they still surviving? Do they show resistance?\" says Symon. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the foundation began taking fresh cuttings once again. And many of the trees they visited were elms found by ramblers last year. </p> <p>\"We took between 7-8,000 cuttings in this batch,\" says Martin Day, who manages a nursery in Bedfordshire for the foundation. \"Next year, we're hoping to do a similar quantity.\" </p> <p>The cuttings have already been soaked in hormones to make them grow roots and will stay in propagation trays for at least the next six months, where they are carefully fed and watered. Within a year or two, they will be planted outside on land where they can be monitored properly. The process is complex and delicate - about half of the cuttings are not expected to make it to the planting stage. But the aims of the project are still ambitious. </p> <p>\"The point of the project is two-fold,\" says Symon. \"To see if these trees have a resistance because their parent trees have remained resistant. And, if that is the case, then that will be replacing some of the elms that were lost on the outbreaks of Dutch elm disease.\" </p> <p>This year's Elm Map walks aim to build on the successes of those last year. \"This year we've got 40 Elm Map walks and half of them have asked for a specialist to accompany them,\" says Stevens. \"They're not all elm specialists, they're natural historians. They're going to add an extra element to the work - it's like taking a whole pile of field guides with you.\" </p> <p>The scientists behind the walks are also hoping to get more information about the local environment around each elm. </p> <p>\"Last year, we were asking people to record elms and that was it,\" Stevens says. \"The plan is to get the specialists observing more information. So people are going out looking at elms, they'll be looking at the associated flora and fauna.\" </p> <p>Stevens is also planning more follow-up work on the elms that are found this year. \"We're going to go out and use those records to look for these biodiversity action plan species that we know are associated,\" she says. This includes everything from butterflies to mushrooms. </p> <p>And people can get involved even if they don't want to ramble. Through the Ancient Trees Forum, enthusiasts can enter information online on any elms they come across throughout the year. </p> <p>The NHM is confident that, this year, even more amateur naturalists will want to get involved in the walks. And having (possibly over-excited) scientific experts will be a bonus - probably. \"We know people who know about butterflies and moths and green scum on fence posts,\" says Stevens. \"I think the danger is that we're not going to get people past the car park.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To get involved in the Elm Map walks, which start on September 18 and will happen across the country, contact the Ramblers' Association on 020 7339 8500 or see <a href=\"http://www.ramblers.org.uk/walks\">www.ramblers.org.uk/walks</a></p>",
  "<p> <strong> The Sims 2</strong> <br> PC, \u00a339.99 Maxis/EA,<br> ***** </p> <p> The sequel to the biggest selling PC game ever is here and it is an absolute treat. As before, this is all about taking control of your own Sims, building them a home, finding them a job and showing them how to clean up. </p> <p>But The Sims 2 takes the concept to the next level. This time you direct your Sims over their lifetime, from baby to \"senior\", and can pass on their genes to future generations. This lifetime attachment is also expressed by aspirations and fears. </p> <p>Players still have to hold their Sim's hand to wash up or shower, but these elements have been downgraded in place of deeper concerns. So younger Sims may want to be read to, and not be shouted at; older Sims may want to attract the eye of a handsome neighbour or avoid being discovered by their wife while cheating with the maid. </p> <p>The vastly improved graphics, which let you zoom in on your characters, show off the full range of new expressions and, more importantly, make you really care about your Sim. </p> <p>Whereas before an upset Sim would seem a vaguely comic matter, it becomes a pressing issue when viewed up close. And that's the key: you do care about your Sims, especially when they age and (sob) die. </p> <p>Throw in an even more comprehensive house design and decorating function, a game-in-itself Sim creation section, and the ability to record movies and you have a fantastic achievement. The Sims 2 has raised the gaming bar. <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Evil Genius</strong> <br> PC, \u00a334.99 Elixir Studios/VU Games,<br> **** <br></p> <p> \"Everybody wants to rule the world,\" sang Tears for Fears. Nearly 20 years later, Elixir Studios turns that statement into virtual reality in Evil Genius, a game where players assume the role of a Bond-style villain on the rocky path to world domination. </p> <p>Being an evil dictator takes hard work. You'll have to recruit a horde of minions to build up a base, while your evil avatar spends time practising a maniacal laugh. With your base established, you have to ensure your operations go global. </p> <p>This means using your control room - the hub of your evil empire - to gain information from around the world. Then you will be able to train the minions and send them out on special acts of infamy, which include capturing hostages, stealing loot and generally causing havoc. </p> <p>As your plans start to succeed, you attract the attention of nations, which will try to thwart your plans with spies and agents. Fiendish traps and torture devices are needed. </p> <p>Evil Genius has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour that permeates the gameplay, and it's packed with details and well-constructed missions. <br> <strong> Rhianna Pratchett </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Conflict: Vietnam</strong> <br> PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, \u00a339.99 Pivotal/SCi, <br> *** <br> The rivalry between publishers is illustrated by the arrival of the latest Vietnam-set instalment of the impressive Conflict series of third-person shoot-'em-ups, hot on the heels of Eidos's Shellshock Nam '67. </p> <p>For those who have been thrown into a sea of indecision, fear not. Conflict: Vietnam is easily the superior. But even so, it is far from perfect. Sensibly, it takes a squad-based approach: you control a team of four men undertaking a series of increasingly hairy missions, amid an accurate rendition of the hell that was the Vietnam war. It offers plenty of opportunities for hard-bitten digitised video scene-setting influenced by films such as Apocalypse Now. </p> <p>The series' perfectly honed squad-control system provides the high point: switching between players is wonderfully intuitive and easily performed even if you are under fire, and the ability to heal squad members at death's door is handy. The missions are varied and believable, and avoid the trap of side-stepping the horror of the war. The console versions sport a handy targeting system that snaps to the nearest enemy, which is essential, since the more accurate shooting view, with gun held up to your eye, is unusable. </p> <p>A huge gun combines with an annoyingly low third-person view, which means you can rarely see oncoming enemies. This is a surprising flaw, given that Pivotal has made several Conflict games. At least the game has a highly appealing cooperative multiplay option. However, Conflict: Vietnam is not an essential purchase. <br> <strong> Steve Boxer </strong> </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Keep up with the latest from the world of games with our Gamesblog, at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/games\">theguardian.com/games</a></p>"
